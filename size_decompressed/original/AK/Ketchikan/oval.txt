Daylight a few miles away, very bright, oval, silent, stationary then disappeared.;2014-08-07 17:30:00;2 minutes;Daylight a few miles away, very bright, oval, silent, stationary then disappeared About 5:30 pm on August 7, when we looked out across the water from my house we saw approximate one mile away a very bright solid object in the sky.  Perhaps it was bright as the sun could have been reflecting off what appeared to be a very shiny metallic surface. Oval in shape.  It appeared to be very slowly moving away from our direction.  Only observed it for a minute or so before it just suddenly disappeared as though it went into the clouds, yet the clouds were to far away for that to be the case.  It was silent.  Never seen anything like that, it was definitely a solid unusual object in the sky with a brilliance like never seen before.  Neither of us have ever seen an UFO before, I personally feel this was a UFO;55.368425;-131.67955
