Aircraft carrier shaped UFO;1978-08-05 14:00:00;3 minutes;Aircraft carrier shaped UFO During the summer of 1978, while I was fishing near Ketchikan, I looked across the ocean at the island in the distance.  I was shocked when I saw a huge, gray UFO that looked similar to an aircraft carrier, hanging in between two mountain tops.  I did not notice any lights on the craft, but clearly saw a soft shiny, metallic hue surrounding it.   As I sat in my boat with chills running down my neck, it hung between the mountains for several minutes.  Then, in a blink of an eye (literally), it simply disappeared from sight without making a sound.   Having spent my entire life in Alaska, I have witnessed many strange sights, but not many that compared to this UFO. I am curious to know if anyone else has seen this particular shaped UFO?   Since this sighting, I have witnessed strange lights hovering in the sky and then moving quickly out of range, but I have never again had the pleasure of seeing this particular craft.
