Fireball like object seen above the small island city of Ketchikan, Alaska.;2014-04-11 21:30:00;2 minutes;Fireball like object seen above the small island city of Ketchikan, Alaska. Around 9:30 at night my fianc√©, his brother, and myself went outside for a cigarette. I noticed a fireball like object in the reflection of my neighbor's window.  We decided to go out into the street to get a better look and when we did we saw a large reddish orangish ball of light in the sky. It came towards the west, got really bright, stopped for about 5 seconds, and then went out of sight towards the east in the opposite direction.   My finance's brothers exact description was, It looked like something on fire!  It looked like an aerial flare from a boat but an aerial flare will arch, and this fireball maneuvered like an air craft of some sort.   One more thing to add..  All the dogs in the area were going crazy.   We do not have an explanation for what this object was.  We have never seen anything fly like that.  All three of us are sober.  I am sure many people saw this tonight because the population is only about seven thousand.;55.368425;-131.67955
