A silent lighted triangle;2001-08-12 22:53:00;8 minutes;A silent lighted triangle I was out on a remote logging road when I saw a shooting star.  I pulled off the road into a big rock pit and reclined my car seat and layed back to watch for more.  I have seen them before and they ussually showed up more than one at a time. shortly agter seeing the star I noticed something slowly coming towards me in the same path that the star was in.  It was a triangular and had lights on it.  The craft was fairly high but came lower as it aproached my vehicle.  It had 4 lights on the front of it.  Two of them were red and two of them were blueish white. It moved extremely slow and it made zero noise.  It literally scared the piss out of me when it hovered infront of and around my vehicle.  As it left my area I could see that it had maybe six to ten bars of light on the back.  They were as tall as the craft and I noticed that two of them were red and two of them were blinking white.  That is about much detail as I can remember.  I am still in shock.  It actually was very scary for me.  It looked exactly like something you would see on unsolved mysteries or some ufo show.  I have always believed in them but now I know they exist.  Anyway that is about all that I can say right now.  Is there any expanation for what I saw?  could the star been the ufo entering the earth?  Interested in learning about what I saw.
