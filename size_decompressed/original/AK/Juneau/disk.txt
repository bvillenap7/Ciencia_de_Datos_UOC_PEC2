Saucer-like craft flies northwest;2005-04-23 18:30:00;10 - 15 seconds;Saucer-like craft flies northwest The sun was setting, and I was inside, at the window, looking northwest at the Gastineau Channel.  I saw an object moving northwest.  I watched it until it was too small to see also, some bushes that were in front of my field of vision blocked it. The object was a saucer shape.  It was much smaller than a commercial airplane.  It was bright, from reflected sunlight.  I assumed that it was metallic, and its color was probably silver. The object moved in a very straight line, with some tilting on its axis from one side to the other.  Its motion was quick, and silent, as far as I could tell.  It also seemed to make little change in altitude.;58.3644032258064;-134.542858064516
