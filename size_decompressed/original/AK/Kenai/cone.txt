My daughter saw it first and brought to our attention. It was moving on a southwesternly path at a pace slower than a Jet yet relatively fast. The form was solid white except for the tail end which was somewhat transparent. The shape was similiar to a cone with a rounded front but the tail did not come to a complete point. I pretty well explained what we saw in the summary but it did not strike us as being a jet plume more like a meteor. It seems to move around the horizon and then we lost site of it as it entered some clouds. It was quite interesting. I called our local radio station and the lady who answered the phone had also seen it and wondered about too.;60.6163999999999;-151.2618
