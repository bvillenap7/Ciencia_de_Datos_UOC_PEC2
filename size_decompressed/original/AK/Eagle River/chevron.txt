V-shaped, silent, no lights, transparent object seen for 30 seconds on 11/3/2015 at 6:45 pm.;2015-11-03 18:00:00;30seconds;V shaped, silent, no lights, transparent object seen for 30 seconds on 11/3/2015 at 6:45 pm. My husband and I had stepped outside, on a crystal clear night to look for northern lights.  He saw a v shaped object, and said do you see that?  I said yes, I DO see that!  It was v shaped, no lights, totally silent, and transparent.   It appeared to be about 800 to 1500 ft up.  He thought it was a flock of migrating birds, I said, birds don't migrate at night, and they make noise.  All the geese are gone by this late in the fall, and are very noisy.  It appeared to be gliding, if that makes sense.   We continued to watch it, having conversation the entire time, until it was out of range.  About 30 seconds.   I don't know what it was, but I know we both watched it in length.  Only one object was observed.;61.311;-149.5165
