It was a very clear night, we observed it for approx. 15 min. The craft itself was oval, and it had a dome that was lit up.  It was dark in color, dark grey or black.  The lights around the dome were yellow. Also there was heat vapors rising from one end of the craft.  After 15 min. it vanished.;61.311;-149.5165

It was colored like the dark background of the sky and moving faster then a helicopter but at that general elevation.  Same or similar object seen on previous Tuesday (Christmas), the material seemed to be reflective and the shape looked like a zeppelin, I described it immediately as like an elongated silver balloon, like you'd see at Wal-Mart.;61.311;-149.5165
