Two bright flying objects flying above Eagle River;2020-03-12 20:57:00;4 minutes;Two bright flying objects flying above Eagle River Saw two circle shape objects flying near each other.  They were the bright and burning yellow.  First noticed them as we have lots of aircraft here in Alaska.  These were not aircraft in my opinion.  The flying was not streamline it was all over kind of darting around.  After it dawned on me it was not aircraft I ran inside and two other people came out and saw the tail end of what I saw.  One was left and the bright burning turned to a wheel with spots on it then disappeared.  The was they flew was like a darting vibrating pattern.  I did capture a short video of it.;61.311;-149.5165
