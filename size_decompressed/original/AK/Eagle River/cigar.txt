White light taveling in a circular motion.;2016-02-08 20:15:00;10 minutes;White light taveling in a circular motion. While out walking my dog, she started acting strange and kept looking up in the sky and was wagging her tail as if she was excited.   I looked up and saw a light traveling in a circular motion, there were not any sounds,, just the light.   I pulled out my Iphone and was trying to record the lights and after 12 seconds there was a fast traveling light going through the sky.   While I was looking at the footage when I got home,  I paused the traveling light and noticed two objects side by side in the frame.  The footage I have is excellent.  The light can be seen traveling in the lower right proceeding left, it starts at the 8 second mark, roughly. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport,  I first saw a light maybe 50 feet in diameter and it was moving in a circular motion.  Then the light went away and I caught whatever it was soaring rather quickly upward.  I noticed only when I watched the video.  Yes, please forward it to the people you spoke of.  Thank you. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  Video shows two lights streaking through the field of view of the camera at very high speed.  PD));61.311;-149.5165
