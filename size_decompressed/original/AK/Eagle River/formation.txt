Roommate got his wife and I's attention brought outside and looked towards Mount Baldy, where the big antenna is, to the right in the sky.   We saw red lights some hovering some moving around, and four stayed in a tight formation fairly still.  They moved very odd.  Dogs in neighborhood barking.   They disappeared in a hurry after what looked like a commercial airliner was moving towards them.   All but one disappeared he hung around for a while and vanished.   Seen similar movement, but a lot faster by the old nike missle silos a year ago. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));61.311;-149.5165

The lights were at 45 degree angles in two separate pairs.  I am unsure if this was one large craft or four separate craft.  The lights hovered at what seemed to be 1000 feet in altitude if I had to guess.  After about 15 seconds of visual all four lights ascended vertically at a rapid pace and eventually disappeared into thin air.  I was in the military for 8 years.  No man made aircraft or drone could have accelerated at that speed vertically.  I suppose that if it was any aircraft at JBER it would have made a sonic boom that I could have heard from my location, however no noise was heard.  I have never witnessed a UFO in my 43 years, this is the first time and felt compelled to report it.;61.311;-149.5165
