Radiating from the spots were long rays of light,flashing yellow, green, orange, and red. I saw it in the south eastern sky not far above the horizon.  I thought it may be an airliner and waited to it move based on reference points I marked. In two hours time, it barely moved at all on the horizon.;60.0095;-151.6402
