4 ufo's lights over Cook Inlet.;2014-03-12 23:30:00;10 minutes;4 ufo's lights over Cook Inlet. A young man came to the local bar and asked if we had a platform out front of Ninilchik.....we all said no...he said well I saw a flash of light and then a triangle of lights out over the water....someone said where he pointed over his shoulder towards cook inlet ....then started really looking and said as a matter of fact there they are....we looked out the windows and then all went outside. ......what the @^#!/.......so in awe didnt take a picture.    Then we all ran down to ninilchik beach seeing them all the way until we came through the two sand pillars to the beach...they were gone.   As I looked the sky I saw six fluorescent orange lights moving in pairs of two across the night sky.  I dont care if anyone doesn't believe what I saw....they were as big or bigger than the sun and glowing fluorescent orange. ....four of them in a straight line across the mountains. It has made believers of some of the people I was with.  I was told that my friend in the caribou hills saw it from her cabin and another two male friends one north and one south both saw them.   I have a friend who lives on the bluff and have asked her to keep on the lookout and a camera handy.;60.0095;-151.6402
