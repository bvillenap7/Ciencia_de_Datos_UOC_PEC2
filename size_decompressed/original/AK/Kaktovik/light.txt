Three lights dancing around each other;2009-12-01 16:00:00;30 minutes;Three lights dancing around each other I saw 3 bright lights on the horizon that I thought was the evening flight (there are only two flights a day to our village), so I went out to the airport to meet it. However, the flight had already left. I found my 3 lights low on the western horizon, and they would move among each other, go up and down, and fade out and back in again. Then they were joined by two more sets of three lights, evenly spaced on either side but several miles out who also danced around similarly.  I watched them for approximately 1/2 hour before I returned to my office (they were still there when I left). The lights changed from yellow to red to white to orange.  They would fade out and return. As mentioned above, this is a remote village with only two airplanes that come a day. There are no other planes that go over our village (we are on the shore of the Arctic ocean).;70.1354;-143.6267
