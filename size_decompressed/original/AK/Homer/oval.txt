Single light changing to multiple lights and back;2009-08-08 23:40:00;30-40 seconds;Single light changing to multiple lights and back I stepped out the front door of the house at aprox. 11:40 PM.  The skies were cloudy and it was mostly dark.  I then noticed one single light in the sky.  At first it seemed very distant and I thought it was a star, planet or satellite.  Then it became brighter and seemed to be either over the bay or over the mountains on the other side of the bay.  Then the light seemed to pivot and become several lights right next to each other.  It could have been 4 or 5 lights.  My impression was that they were connected to a single oval shaped object but I canâ€™t be sure.  Each white light was equally bright.  I did not get the impression it was moving in terms of distance but spinning or pivoting.  I wondered if it could be an airplane but it was staying in one place and did not seem to have the same light pattern as an airplane.  The light then seemed to pivot again and become the single light I originally saw.  The light then started to dim and continued to do so unti! l it disappeared from my sight.  The entire event lasted 30-40 seconds.;59.5381;-151.2401
