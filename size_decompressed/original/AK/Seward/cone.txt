Photograph of unidentified object;2010-09-23 07:00:00;unknown;Photograph of unidentified object I was taking pictures off the back of a boat as I was leaving the marina at Seward, Alaska.   We did not take a close look at the pictures until recently.  When we did, we observed two gold color, round, coneshaped objects in the sky.   I did not notice these at the time I took the picture, and cannot explain what they are in the picture.  I did not retouch or alter the photograph in anyway.   When you zoom in on the objects in the pictures, you can see it is comprised of small gold squares.   We could not see anything in the vicinity that could have caused a reflection.   I posted a copy of the image on my photography website at:   http://anthony-trillo.artistwebsites.com/.   I will also email a copy to you.
