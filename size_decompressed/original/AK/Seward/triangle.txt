Seward Alaska, April 2001--massive sighting of battleship sized black triangle and other UFO's could not be confirmed.;2001-04-18 01:00:00;12 hours;Seward Alaska, April 2001--massive sighting of battleship sized black triangle and other UFO's could not be confirmed. An observer Xin Seward has reported massive sightings of large black triangular battleship sized ufo's on a nightly basis, and others.  This reporter spent the night in Seward and saw nothing flying in the sky at any time,  while during the same time period X again reported seeing two ufo's merge in the sky and numerous military aircraft overflights.  None of this could be confirmed by the reporter, who is the MUFON Alaska State Director, Glen Harper.  I have received numerous requests to investigate this major flap occuring in Seward.  This is the reason for this report of a non-event.  I will continue to investigate. ((NUFORC Note:  Our gratitude to Mr. Glen Harper, MUFON State Director, Alaska, for having performed the follow up investigation on this case, and for having shared his findings with NUFORC.  We have known Mr. Harper for many years, and know him to be a very capable investigator.  Any witnesses to the alleged events in Seward, AK, may contact Mr. Harper at:  <clearwater@gci.net>.
