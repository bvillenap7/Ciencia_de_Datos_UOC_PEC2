I was only able to view it for a few seconds. It wasn't dark at 2:00AM because at that latitude it doesn't get dark in mid-June. Still, it was dusky and overcast so the true color of the craft was hard to determine. It appeared dull gray to me and there were no lights. Even though I had both windows down, I couldn't hear any sound coming from the craft. No engine noise whatsoever. I estimate its speed at roughly 400 mph and its elevation at around 1000 feet, possibly lower. The object wasn't huge, roughly 75 feet in diameter. Seward is south of Anchorage so the craft would have been heading north. I am coming forward with this now because Peter Davenport indicated on the rdaio that all sightings are relevant, no matter how dated.
