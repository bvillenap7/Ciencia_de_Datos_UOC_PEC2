The first evening Bob ******* & me where sitting around the camp fire when he said whats that?, & looking up in the night sky. I looked in the direction he was looking at & in the sky was a bright light way up, so far up that it looked like a star. This light was amazing! The light would streak across the sky & appear to go many miles(40-80 miles?) in a flash & stop on a dime & change at a 90 degree angle & zoom another long distance,stop on a dime again, change direction again & do the same thing again. Some times it would pause a few minutes before doing the zigging & zagging. It went on so long that I stopped looking up to give my neck a rest. But Bob kept on watching till it finally left. We were looking towards the northwestern part of the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));60.5136;-150.8532
