There was an event where an Japanese airliner reported an ufo sighting south of the aleution islands.  Me and a friend witnessed an ufo the same evening while we were fishing on Adak island.  this occured somewhere around 1986 and we were both avionics technichnicians in the us navy.  I have extensive knowlage in aircraft and airodynamics.  This object defied all aero dynamics that we knew. we agreed not to ever say anything about it.
