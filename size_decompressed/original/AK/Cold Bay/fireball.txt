Fireballs traveling low on horizon at great rate of speed and manueverablilty;1995-09-20 19:30:00;2minutes;Fireballs traveling low on horizon at great rate of speed and manueverablilty My wife and I were parked on a dock, facing north, when I noticed what I thought was an extremely large ball of fire on the beach of Kenzuroff Lagoon apx. 4 miles from our location.  Then the ball of fire began traveling along the horizon on a westerly course at a fast but earthly rate of speed.  I summized to my wife that It must be a helicopter or something.  It accelerated and followed the hilly terrain at a speed well above any normal fixed wing or rotor aircraft.  It departed from the horizon still accellerating and dissappeared into the overcast which I estimated to have been 2500 ft agl.  When It dissapeared my wife noticed another such object following apx. 5 secs. behind.  It follwed a similar course and dissapeared.;55.1858;-162.7211
