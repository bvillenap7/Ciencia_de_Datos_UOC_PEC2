Traveled left to right in the night sky in an up and down zig zag type movement. I was resting in my room. The night was very clear, the stars were out. I saw a bright light through the left side of my window. It was in space, not in earths atmosphere. It was larger than the stars and any sattelite for that matter. The object was mostly white, with some blue and possibly red. It moved up and down in a zig zag pattern, changing colors. I wondered to myself,What the heck is that? I opended my window and watched it glide in its zig zag pattern. It had a tail which would delay and chase the object as it moved. I heard an echo or pulsating sound, but I have no idea if the object and the sound were linked. The next day I read about it in the local paper. Apparently others had seen it as well.;57.0478;-135.32
