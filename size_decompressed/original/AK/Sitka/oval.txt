Yellowish oval disk making erratic movements, spotted by airline pilot.;2015-07-04 23:15:00;6 minutes;Yellowish oval disk making erratic movements, spotted by airline pilot. Saw a light moving in an Easterly direction (towards town).  Light was moving very fast (faster than an airliner) and had no position (navigation) lights to indicate it was a civilian aircraft.  Just a solid yellow light.  The craft stopped  suddenly, started increasing in altitude (slowly), stopped, then made a lateral movement to the south (slowly), stopped, then the light went out.    There was enough daylight and we were able to obtain binoculars to make out the shape of the object.  After the light of the craft went out, the craft started a tumbling/twisting motion while descending directly towards the earth.   We suppose it took 2 minutes for the craft to descend until it was out of view.;57.0478;-135.32
