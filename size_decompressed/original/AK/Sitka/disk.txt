Object was luminesent (sp) almost a platinum whitish type glow, reflected in the bay, cruised noiselessly and constantly (slow) up bay.  Guessing object is less than 100 ft diameter and guessing object roughly 500' off water. See above;57.0478;-135.32

Just then my 4 year old son who was sitting at the kitchen table, looking out the window, went crazy and said he saw a ufo disk shape, with a bubble in the middle, and an antenna in top of it with lights.   He said it was spinning and flying fast over the trees about 25 yards away.   Although my son is only 4 years old, we don't believe he was making this up.  He was to excited about it.   We made him draw a picture out it also. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Sorry I must have hit the wrong state.  It's Sitka, Alaska.  Zip 99835  ((END ADDENDUM));57.0478;-135.32
