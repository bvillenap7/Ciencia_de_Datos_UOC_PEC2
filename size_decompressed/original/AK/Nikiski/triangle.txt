As we approched the light, we noticed it wasnt up in the sky, rather above the trees next to the road. the bright light flashed and became two dimmer lights.. we were able to drive right next to it as it was beside the main road.  The sun here hardly goes down, so we could make out the edge of the triangle.  three dim lights at the edges none in the middle, no noise, driver strangely took off as we started to investigate.  Later that night, we saw five helicopters doing circles around town w/ only a green light.  also the refinery here was acting strange/huge fire.;60.7007;-151.2766
