rotating teardrop over trees/highway;2008-06-23 15:00:00;2-3 minutes;rotating teardrop over trees/highway Well what I had seen was a rotating oval with the narrow end of the oval was sharpened and then rounded off making it look like a sunflower seed.  It was a grayish blue in color but it was dull not shiny. It seemed to arise from the trees from a vertical takeoff the seemed to proceed horizontally towards the mountains, and then faded smaller and smaller as the object went off into the distance. It was outside of my dads work at the time he went off to get something inside, so I was bored I looked out the window and happened to get a glimpse of it.  This aircraft was very slow if it was an airplane it would have fell right out of the sky.  As it rises from the trees spiraling in the air it continued to spin as it went off into the distance. This sunflower seed shaped aircraft that flies horizontally and vertically while in a rotating motion, this aircraft that is a dull blue gray was rounded everywhere and had some sort of window or some circular shaped panels all over the back side  I don’t know if that’s what made it move or if they are lights, windows I don’t know.  This aircraft flies silently send slow breaking the laws of gravity is what it seems to me. I just had an encounter and wanted to document it and get it off my mind.  Because whatever I saw was an unidentified flying object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));61.1806704545454;-149.868771503497
