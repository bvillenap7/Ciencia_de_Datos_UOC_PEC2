BRIGHT WHITE ORB:  (Silently Followed 2 Witnesses), Two Sharp Turns, Instant Mach Speed Departure.;1978-03-28 20:45:00;7 minutes;BRIGHT WHITE ORB: (Silently Followed 2 Witnesses), Two Sharp Turns, Instant Mach Speed Departure CIRCUMSTANCES -  TIME:  Night 7:00PM-9:30PM   TIME OF YEAR:  Winter   DATE: 1978, 1979, or 1980  WEATHER:  Crystal Clear Starlit Night  ACTIVITY:  Walking home from Kanchee Park (Klevin St. & E 4th Ave.) Anchorage, Alaska, proceeding East on E 4th Ave., then right heading South on Hoyt St. toward home near E 7th Ave & Hoyt St. Additional Witness: Paul  - UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT - SHAPE & DESCRIPTION: Bright White Sphere/Orb, Slow Hovering Movement, No Audible Sound, Made 2 perfect 90 Degree Turns, (Not Moon, Not Planet, Not Star, Not Helicopter Spotlight, Not Plane) PATH & EVENTS: Bright White Orb, No Sound, followed Paul and I, on our right side approximately 60 feet to the South, at an altitude of approximately 75 to 150 feet, as we proceeded East on E 4th Ave.  We joked about it being a UFO as we kept watching it during our walk.  When we turned right to head South onto Hoyt St. it turned right as well and headed South at the same altitude.  We were then alarmed and started eliminating options like aircraft, helicopter, perceived distance, etc.  After eliminating all known possibilities, with the object continuing to follow we became concerned, started to walk towards it, yell at it, and threw snow balls at it.  The altitude was too high to hit the object.  The object was not deterred.  We gave up attempting to scare it off and continued to proceed South on Hoyt St.  The Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) proceeded to follow us.  At approximately E 6th Ave. the object shot off, heading West, at a visually trackable but incredible rate of speed, just ! to the South of downtown Anchorage and disappeared over the horizon as it appeared to cross the Cook Inlet.  - IMPORTANT NOTES - The Bright White Orb approached behind us from the West and followed adjacent or parallel to our right or South at a distance of approximately 60 feet (altitude 75-150 feet). WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT? It occurred to me just yesterday (08/03/2017), after 35 years, that this object was most likely intelligently operated. WHY? If the object would have approached us at, or near, that altitude from any other side it could have dangerously interfered with the take-off and landing Flight Corridor of not only the military, at Elmendorf Air Force Base, but also the civilian, at Merrill Field Airport.  The object followed us just a few hundred feet to the West of the Elmendorf AFB Flight Corridor and departed silently at instant mach speeds just a few hundred feet North of the Merrill Field Flight Corridor, heading West past and parallel to Merrill Field. HUMAN CRAFT OR PLANE(?): Not a traditionally recognizable human flight vehicle, it was silent, it hovered, it could stay aloft at walking speed, it made two perfect 90 degree turns, it instantly accelerated to greater than mach speeds with no jet type visual exhaust and no sonic boom(s).  It specifically followed us and stayed just outside the two Flight Corridors (military & civilian) by just a few hundred feet.  If it was a human plane, it could not have performed in such a manner and its flight path would have been in one of the Flight Corridors.  I grew up in the cross section of the military and civilian Flight Corridors.  I watched literally hundreds of very low altitude civilian and military aircraft, landing and taking off, day and night (Cessna's, C-130's, F-15s, Visiting Blue Angels, etc.).  My reasonable assessment, then and now, is that this was not a traditionally recognizable human flight vehicle.  - DISCLAIMER - I am only relaying the facts as I recall them.  I make no claims as to the objects origin or purpose.  It could be the false recollection of a youthful imagination.  Nonetheless, with due diligence and intellectual integrity, I have considered and reasonably dismissed all normal or likely origins to account for this object.  Simply put, the object appeared to be an Unidentifiable Flying Object with uncharacteristic flight behaviors.

Saw a silver sphere that moved slowly, gradually picking up speed, moving from north to south.;1995-08-01 17:00:00;12 seconds;Saw a silver sphere that moved slowly, gradually picking up speed, moving from north to south. I was taking out trash at the end of my shift and having a cigarette.  I heard a hissing sound, almost like something was releasing an air brake (though not as sharp and loud).  I looked up and saw a silver sphere about 50 feet over a field across the highway from me, at approximately 100 yards away. The sphere moved slowly and gradually picked up speed, going from north to south. It took 10-12 seconds to go from where I first saw it until it vanished from sight to the south.  I could see the ground reflected on the bottom of the sphere as it flew by.  I seem to recall two jet fighters chasing after it almost immediately after it began acceleration. This isn't the first or the last time I've seen UFOs, just the more memorable one because of the jet fighters.

black sphere with bright orange spotlight appears on x-mas eve in Alaska.;2003-12-25 00:00:00;approx 5 min;black sphere with bright orange spotlight appears on x-mas eve in Alaska. It was Christmas eve so we were joking that it was Santa Claus. We saw it directly above some power lines from our viewpoint (the power lines were approx 30 feet away) and it appeared to be slightly bigger than than a #2 pencil point. Strangely enough, it was not a clear night, it was definently cloudy and although it was pitch black out, you could still make out the UFO's black sphere against the sky. The sphere had one large round, orange light, like a spotlight almost. It was very bright. It was stationary when I first saw it, and then started moving quickly in irregular patterns. It moved unlike anything I'd ever seen before. After what seemed like an hour (although it was in reality only 5 minutes), it dissapeared in a zoom like manner. The only way I can describe how it 'zoomed away' is it kind of looked a little bit like the Starship enterprise 'zoom' in Star Trek (except without the bright flash). This was absolutely not a satellite, nor any plane that I know of. My entire family witnessed this event and I assure you, there was no special Christmass eggnog involved. I'd be more than happy to draw this UFO or make a computer graphic of it.;61.1806704545454;-149.868771503497
I saw a silver sphere over Anchorage, Alaska, It stopped hovered and then disappeared before my eyes.;2004-05-28 08:35:00;15-20 seconds;I saw a silver sphere over Anchorage, Alaska, It stopped hovered and then disappeared before my eyes. In the spring of 04, as I was driving off Elmendorf AFB, I saw a silver sphere in the sky. I was stopped at the stop light just before the bridge at Mountain View and Boniface Parkway. There were other cars at the light also. I noticed a small aircraft flying from east to west. What caught my eye was it looked to be towing something. This is not unheard of for the Anchorage area, but not all that common either.  I thought it was towing a large balloon at first. By comparing it to the plane, I’d say it looked to be about  eight feet tall. As I was looking at it, it stopped moving and the plane kept going. At first I thought it broke away from the tow rope or whatever, but as the plane flew further away, I could tell the sphere was actually much further away than I first thought. I think it had just happened to be moving at the same rate as the airplane, making it look like it was being towed.  It was very near the Chugach  mountain range, which is east of Anchorage. I could tell it was spinning on it’s own axis. It was totally featureless. Just a silver orb now hovering in the sky spinning. Then it just disappeared. It is hard to explain, but it looked as though  it disappeared on itself as it turned. It never made a sound, but it was far enough away that I don’t think I could have heard it if it did.  When I first noticed it, I was looking through my windshield. I thought it might be some kind of reflection off the windshield, so I rolled down my window and stuck my head out, so I’m sure it was actually there. After it had disappeared, I looked around me to see if anybody else in the other cars had seen it. No one seemed to have noticed it. It was only visible for about 15 or 20 seconds.  I reported this incident shortly after it happened to your web site. It said it had accepted it, but the report never showed on the site. I just chalked it up to a computer error and forgot about it. I’ve only told two people about this incident. My wife and my youngest son. They both laughed at me and thought I was seeing things so I dropped it and never talked about it again. But today, 02/29/08, My oldest adult daughter was visiting with me, and somehow the subject of UFOs came up. Well, it turns out she saw the exact same thing in the same general location about two months ago. So I thought maybe it was important enough to resubmit it. I will leave it to her to decide weather to report her sighting or not.  This incident really occurred. It was a real object, and it really disappeared before my eyes. I am not an attention seeker. I am a military retiree, an ex cop and currently work in the federal security field, so this kind of publicity I don’t need. Do with this report what you will.

Five glowing lights traveling at slow speeds without engine noise.;2012-01-01 19:30:00;5 min;Five glowing lights traveling at slow speeds without engine noise. Around 7:30 pm saw 5 lights traveling in the same direction from SE to NE. One alone at first then another one, then two side by side, then one. Fairly evenly spaced almost like military planes returning from a sortie. However what caught my eye is how slow they were flying. They also were a steady glow that that cycled between a reddish orange and yellow. They then at the same point in the sky appeared to go straight up and then disappear. The other noticeable charateristic is that there wasn't any engine noise at all. Completely silent  leading me to believe they weren't helicopters.  I am an electrician and have wired many runways so I am familiar with airplane lights and runway lights along with FAA standards. These were not airplanes of any conventional standard.

Red lights in line formation coming over the mountains in Anchorage Alaska.;2012-01-23 19:30:00;2 minutes;Red lights in line formation coming over the mountains in Anchorage Alaska. We were waiting in the parking lot it was 730 pm and i looked over at these red lights coming over the mountains in line formation.  I thought it was military parachuting or exercises or something unitl the red speres spread apart hoovered and then went staight up slowly at the same pace all of them and then disappeared.;61.1806704545454;-149.868771503497
Red and blue color changing orb moving in all directions.;2016-08-30 23:08:00;5 minutes;Red and blue color changing orb moving in all directions. I went out on my deck and i saw a fast moving blinking white light.  It then turned solid red. It was going faster then a plane, then all of a sudden it stopped and went the oppisite direction.  Then it was moving diagnal, then up and down.  Then it turned really bright solid blue for a few seconds.  Then it turned red again and went over towards some planes coming.  Circled around them.  The movement of this red and blue orb was the most unique part.  Then it seemed like the orb didn't know what to do.  Then it feathered down past the tree line.  The interesting part was that i grabbed my phone to record it and i only got one second, and my phone misteriously died and i had 15% charge.  It didn't want me to record it.;61.1806704545454;-149.868771503497
