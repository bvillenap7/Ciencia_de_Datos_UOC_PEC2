Fort Greely UFO sighting.;2008-11-20 01:00:00;30 seconds;Fort Greely UFO sighting. On the morning of 11/19/2008 around 11pm I received a text from a MP stationed at fort Greely.  The Mp who was with 3 other MPs were doing security checks when they saw the lights.  They reported it to the shift supervisor who dismissed it at Military planes.  The text they sent was asking me if I could go outside and see if I could see the lights. I was on fort greely went outside and saw no lights.  I texted them back and told them I saw no lights and asked what direction they went. I got into my vehicle and headed down the hwy toward  Delta Junction (5miles away).  There is no one on the road it is a isolated area. I looked toward the Tanana River and saw 3 lights.  I stopped my truck on the road and got out.  The 3 object came toward me hovering. They had 3 green light circular. On the bottom in the form of a triangle.  I was stopped on the road in from of the airstrip at fort greely.  As I looked at the airport and the object hovering above me.  All the l! ights oat the airport turned off.  Then a penal (looked like an old drive in movie theater screen) Flasshed on. That was the only light on the base and the 3 objects hovering above me.  The light flashed like a strobe light flash flash flash then off then flash flash flash then off.  I looked up at the object and in 1 second they flew in the direction of the. Tanana river.  They disappeared that fast. I contacted  other ufo sights and spoke about my encounter.  It has bothered me all these years.  I FEELNLIKE IT WAS A DREAM.  This really happened to me.  This event took place I witnessed it. There was no sound from the object light a plane how it sounds it was completely quite.;63.952;-146.451
