The;2018-07-01 23:00:00;2-4 minutes;4 blue/green saucer objects appeared in 4 of 8 sequential pictures taken at night from a tripod ? The I am a 73 year old Vietnam Marine vet.  Presently I donâ€™t drink or due any drugs nor have I ever had an addition to those vices.  I have never observed a UFO until I took several pictures with my Sony ax7 camera mounted on a tripod from my room at the Grand Alution Hotel.  It was a full moon  night with a great view of the harbor.  Without adjusting or moving the camera I took several shots.  Only in 4 pictures out of 8 did these blue/green saucer images appear.  They were faint at first but came closer and traveled  from a clouded area and to the left.  I will send you the sequence of photos so you can evaluate them and please let me know if this is really a UFO sighting?;53.8865;-166.5387
