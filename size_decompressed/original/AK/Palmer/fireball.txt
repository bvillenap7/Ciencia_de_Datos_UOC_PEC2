I went in the kitchen and happened to glance out the window and I saw these fire like orbs floating from the ground up and left into the sky behind the mouse house daycare city corner across the street...  At first I saw 3 one behind the other and one by one they went up into the sky and disappeared ... I kept watching and then more kept coming from the same location and each one disappeared into the sky... They kept on coming at 1 or 2 second intervals there was about 13 all together... Then I didn't see any more but and each one appeared to be dropping 1 or 2 pieces of fire from them that disappeared as they floated towards the ground... As the fire balls went up into the sky they changed from fire orbs to an orange color before they disappeared ...;61.6303;-148.9872
