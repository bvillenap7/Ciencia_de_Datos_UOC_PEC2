Large orange cylindrical object flying over and near Pioneer Peak Alaska (6,000 ft in elevation);2013-11-18 21:00:00;20 minutes;Large orange cylindrical object flying over and near Pioneer Peak Alaska (6,000 ft in elevation) Watched the cylindrical object with an orange fire ball appear over Pioneer Peak and head in a North Easterly direction.  It had abnormal flight patterns, hovered and chaned altitude/ direction a few times before attaining a linear path.  Altitude then remained high, object moved slowly with no sound.  I contacted my neighbors to confirm what my family and I witnessed.  They too saw the object and had never seen anything like it before.  When I looked at it through my binoculars, it looked like a fire ball with a cylindrical shape, but had an almost translucent top, it almost resembled a sail.;61.6303;-148.9872
