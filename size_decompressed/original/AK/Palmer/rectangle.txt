I looked towards the pioneer peek and further towards the Exit Glacier, in the sky a black rectangle was standing still about level with the pioneer peak.  The object would have been about 40 miles away as a bird flies.  I guess it would have been huge.  Then I tried to get video of it, as I am an investigator, always taking video.  The camera would not focus on the object.  Then it began to slope to the left and never changed from being a level black rectangle.  Then it disappeared behind some clouds that were quite far away.;61.6303;-148.9872
