I seen an object that looked just like a star moving.;2015-03-18 23:40:00;15 seconds;Was driving down Green Tree St., Palmer.  Was looking at some northern lights, which was mild compared to the night before.   I seen an object that looked just like a star moving..  At first thought, I thought it was a satellite, but realized, after years of seeing them, it was moving to fast, and it was too bright.  Covering a distance that is impossible for any of our aircraft that the public know about..so I thought maybe a meteorite, until it maneuvered a course correction faster than anything I know about it.  My fiance saw it after the change in direction.   Then it seem to fade out as it was moving faster than anything I've seen.  But came back into sight again moving towards the horizon within secondsâ€¦   iv never reported anything like this, and I'm kinda in shock.. i hope, someone else saw this, Please report it.;61.6303;-148.9872
