On Jan. 8, 1999 at approx. 10:45 PM (Alaska Time) I had retired to bed and my husband was watching TV downstairs I noticed a bright Flash through my blinds and I wondered what it was but just shrugged it off as possibly being a big truck with high beams on coming up from the neighbors house across the street.  At the same time my husband noticed a bright flash that lighted up the whole back yard he shrugged it off too.  Then we both felt that rummbling feeling that you feel with a earth quake and then a big boom like an explosion of some kind.  It was so loud  it literally shook the house, I yelled what was that and we looked out the window thinking one of our neighbors houses had blown up!  About 11:05 PM the same night my neighbor called and said his daughter called him with a report on the radio that a Meteor just crashed at mile 143 on the Parks Hwy. (Heading North)  I called some friends in Eagle River, AK. (35 miles from us) and they seen the Flash and felt the Boom Too!  My daughter called me and she had just heard on the radio that the State Troopers wanted anyone that could pin-point the impact area to please call them and that they wanted to reasure people that it was not a missle!  That's about it we're trying to get some information about it now and no one seems to know anything and it is Now Jan.9,1999 at 9:00AM;61.6303;-148.9872
