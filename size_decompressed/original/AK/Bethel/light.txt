Orange/Reddish Lights;2012-03-03 22:15:00;5-10 minutes;Orange/Reddish Lights Slow moving red lights moving from NW-SE over Bethel AK, no noise. I was outside videworld on 3/3/12 at about 10:15 pm.  I noticed an orange/reddish light in the sky, slowly moving in my direction from the NW.  At first I thought it might be an aircraft, but there were no anti-collision lights, beacons, or position lights.  There was also no noise. After the light passed, I noticed another red light, followed by another red light.  The third one vanished, shortly after a fourth red light appeared.  The lights were slow moving but had a constant speed, and no noise.   From the first light I seen to the last, the lights were visible for approx. 5-10 min.;60.7902;-161.7515
