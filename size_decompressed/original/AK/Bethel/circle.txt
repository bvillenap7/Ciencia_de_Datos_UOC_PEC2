Orange circle of light moving from SE to NW.;2012-04-06 22:50:00;30 seconds;Orange circle of light moving from SE to NW. We saw a round, orange, circle of light moving from the SE moving across the sky to the NW.  We watched it until we couldn’t see it anymore.  Then a second orange circle of light moved across the sky in the same path.  Each light moved from SE to NW for about 30 -40 seconds or so.  We got the binoculars, but we couldn’t make out what the light was.;60.7902;-161.7515
Bizarre red light (globes) movements in the sky.;2013-03-03 18:30:00;2 minutes;Bizzare red light (globes) movements in the sky witnessed 2 red round objects following one another in the evening sky in a north direction they were moving very fast following each other at a distance..  the leading object seemed to begin to fade from site rapidly and then disappeared and the following object seemed to rapidly slow down but continue to move forward I watched it for a full minuet and a half before it began do move on but at a  much slower rate of movement away from me before slowly disappearing from site..  In all my life I have never witnessed anything like it I was like WTh is going on ..just needed to tell you thanks for you time..i don't know what that it was I saw but if that dosent make it a ufo nothing ever will haha..;60.7902;-161.7515
