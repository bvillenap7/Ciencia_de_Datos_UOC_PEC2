White/Blue fireball object fell from the sky.;1999-02-12 01:30:00;30-45 sec;White/Blue fireball object fell from the sky. My two friends and I were driving home from a local music concert.  At the time, we were in 11th grade.  We were dropping off our friend when the driver noticed this thing in the sky.  It was like a fireball only it was white with hints of blue, which indicate that Magnesium or Aluminum was being burned with possible traces of Copper.  The burning thing was huge and traveled very fast towards the ground.  It was far away, we couldn't tell how far, but we couldn't hear it.  The size of it would be the size of a pea held about 18 from the face.  We watched it disappear behind the treeline (trees were primarily spruce and birch).  Once it went behind the treeline, there was a quick flash of light.  No sound, no physical effects from it hitting the ground.  We drove around, thinking that someone had shot a flare from a flare gun.  But, no one was up.  The temperature outside was about -10F or so, perhaps colder, so it's no surprise that no one was outside.  The next day the radio news broadcast reported that a meteor had fallen somewhere outside of Anchorage and had been cleaned up by the military.  Anchorage is a little over 400 miles south of North Pole.  This seems like a poor coverup for whatever really happened.;64.7793;-147.3578
