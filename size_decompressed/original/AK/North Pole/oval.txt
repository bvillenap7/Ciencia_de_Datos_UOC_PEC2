Large white ball in the sky;2006-06-15 01:43:00;a couple seconds;Large white ball in the sky I was in my car driving through town to get soething to eat before work (I work LATE nights) when I saw this white ball floating through the sky, it was too large to be an orbiting satelite and it was kinda fuzzy and blurry. The odd part was that it stopped for about 5 seconds then it bolted off,  It was in sight no more than 15-20 seconds before it vanished,  A few seconds later after I heard Jet engines roaring over....
