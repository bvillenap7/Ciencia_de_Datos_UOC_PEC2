((HOAX??))  Strange ships and electrical interference.;2007-06-30 22:09:00;Approx. 3hrs;Strange ships and electrical interference Me and my Brother are driving back from town around 10:09 (car clock) and since summer solistice wasn't too long ago it was fairly bright outside.   I was sitting in the passenger seat and my bro was driving when our car elecrical flickerd, the radio went to static and the car stopped.  We pulled over and were looking around when all of a sudden I saw a bright object in the corner of my eye, I told my brother to look and we saw like 9 ships flying in a random patten.  At this time me and him were freaking and we went back into the truck and we watched for what seemed like hours, and the ships left in a streak of speed and when we looked at the clock it was 10:15, I guess when you are freaking out time passes alot slower. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  Hoax??  PD));64.7793;-147.3578
