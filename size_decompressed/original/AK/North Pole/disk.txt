ufo by an air force base;2001-01-24 00:00:00;10 seconds;ufo by an air force base I was driving home from an air force base after a basketball game, it was around 9:30 and my dad and i were driving.  like about a mile from the base i'm just looking out at the stars, and it was a clear nite, about 40 below, and i see this light kind of behind us to my left, pretty distant.  And i know at like 10pm the air force isn't flying, but i was like  maybe its an exercise.  then like not 3 seconds later this thing is on the other side of the highway about 30 feet in the air, rite on top of the trees then comes around in front of us and it had like two headlights and underneath it had lights shinging down, and it was like a round disc shape, BUT there was no noise, absolutely none, and if a F-16 was flying that low and rite in front of us there would be lots of noise.  And for the half a second it flew in front of us it seemed to slow down then went off the highway too my right and hovered over a trailer (the only plane that can hover is in England), then zoomed off the way it came very quickly and like disappeared.;64.7793;-147.3578
