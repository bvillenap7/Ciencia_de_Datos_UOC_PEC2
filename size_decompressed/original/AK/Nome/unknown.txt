((HOAX))  Multiple lights appeared, apparently altering our perception of time, and then disappeared.;2015-11-01 00:00:00;3 minutes;Multiple lights appeared, apparently altering our perception of time, and then disappeared. I was out in my yard and saw several lights in the sky.  They stayed relatively still, and their number varied.  There were about 7 at first, but some of them blinked out and new ones appeared.  I pointed them out to my wife, who concurred with my assessment. After what seemed like several hours, they began to phase in and out of existence.  Then they flashed and blinked out completely.  I then discovered that only 3 minutes had passed.  Our dog was hiding in a thicket for the entire time, growling softly. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE)) I recently submitted a hoax report.
