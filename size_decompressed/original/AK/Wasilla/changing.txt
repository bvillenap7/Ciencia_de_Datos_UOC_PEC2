Red and white lights on UFO.;2014-03-28 11:17:00;~60 minutes;Red and white lights on UFO. I saw two objects which at first I thought were airplanes, but after a few seconds i realized they had too many lights on them, and the front light or lights were too big and bright to be plane lights.   These two objects appeared to be discs the first time i saw them, they proceeded to fly in wide circles around the neighborhood and i started walking home, i saw them making the circle after i'd turned around, and then i turned again to watch them keep going the full circle, and i saw one, or both i can't remember, move the front light or lights to look in my direction, without changing their course of motion.   I continued walking home, and after i got home a few minutes went by and then i saw them coming my way and making the circuit again, and this time without my headphones on i heard a sound like thunder, or high winds against a building, a low bass sound not a high pitched one at all, and for about a minute as i saw these things passing by they made that sound.  it was quite loud, the two times they passed by my house i got some short footage on my phone, but i wish i had a better camera.   Anyway, thats basically how it happened, now it may have been two regular aircraft, but with that many lights, that can move like that, and that fly that close to the ground which i'm pretty sure is illegal?  I don't think so.  Oh and the lights were red and white, and once i saw blue flash like twice.;61.5812603174603;-149.413663492064
