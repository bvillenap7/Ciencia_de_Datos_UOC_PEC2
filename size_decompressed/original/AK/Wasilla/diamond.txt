Diamond shaped craft over Seldon and MountainCrest drives.;2015-03-23 21:56:00;30 seconds;Diamond shaped craft over seldon and MountainCrest drives. I came around the round about on seldom road and noticed a diamond shaped craft in the middle of the street it was so low over seldon and mountain crest road it looked like it was going to hit the trees or homes.  Then I got my senses together and turned left onto Mountaincrest dr.   After I turned it went from flat diamond looking craft to completely sideways like flat like a peice of paper standing up, and took off through the trees.  It got about a quarter mile up and stopped and gradually drifted further away.  Then shot off.  There were red, green, yellow, white, maybe blue lights.   I was in shock I was thinking Tetris in my mind for some reason.;61.5812603174603;-149.413663492064
