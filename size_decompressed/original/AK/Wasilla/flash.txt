Widely reported event was an exploding meteor.  ((NUFORC Note:  Suspected meteor, but difficult to know for sure.  PD));1999-01-08 22:45:00;30 seconds;Widely reported event was an exploding meteor. I am writing in response to other reports submitted to NUFORC for that evening.    The event in question was experienced by all five members of my family, hundreds of people in South Central Alaska, and reported in the newspaper and on broadcast news the following day.  Basically it was a meteor that many witnesses observed making a brief streak in the sky that was punctuated by a brilliant flash.  Depending on the observer's location, either a boom or rumble was heard about 30 seconds to 2 minutes later.  The event seemed to occur almost directly over Willow, Alaska, and was observed slightly WNW of true vertical as observed from my house. I was surprised at both the brilliancy of the flash and the power of the rumble, which could be quite aptly described as seismic.  Although this wasn't a true UFO as it has been rather clearly identified as an incoming meteor with unusual intensity, it serves as a nice comparison to the other reports in this database that are not explainable.

Flashing, fast moving light over Alaska.;2017-12-01 01:00:00;25 minutes;Flashing, fast moving light over Alaska. At first, i thought that I saw a bright star, and then it slowly started to move.  It was hard to capture on video,.  Nobody thinks that it was a drone or has any other logical explanation.   We have been seeing both drones and these for months, and the drones have the deep noise, while this has none.;61.5812603174603;-149.413663492064
