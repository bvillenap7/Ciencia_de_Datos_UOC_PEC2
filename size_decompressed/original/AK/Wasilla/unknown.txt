Went out to the north porch to check for the aurora, and noticed one red flashing light from the north northwest, heading south.  It was soon followed by a second one.   Thought they were jets on a glide path but noticed there was no green wing light, or any sound, so I thought they were possibly distant helicopters.   A third, much brighter or closer, red light (not flashing) came from almost directly north, and headed south, toward us, and was soundless too.  It seemed less than 5 miles away. I went to get my wife and daughter to see them.   When we got out to the porch, only the closer red light was visible and much dimmer even though it seemed nearer.   It eventually dimmed, or perhaps, it gained altitude until it disappeared.;61.5812603174603;-149.413663492064
