Body Inhabitated;2012-11-15 00:00:00;25 minutes;Body Inhabitated It was late.  Me and my spouse at the time were talking.  Something entered him.  He had one eye wide open and another eye was normal.  He was talking in a weird language.  He would speak and then he would ask me questions.  He asked me several questions and he moved around to several different spots while he was in the trance.  I had seen a red orb earlier.  I wanted to call someone and tell someone about it but for fear of being called crazy.  The good thing is that he can testify to the event as well.  It was like something took him over and it was gone as soon as it entered.  I told it to leave and I told him to tell it to leave.  My spouse has no mental or medical explanation.  Neither one of us are mentally or physically challenged.  Ever since then I have not been the same.  I have changed.   Thank you for your time and consideration.  Missing time and also the TV and other things stopped working and started making fuzz sounds and noises. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
