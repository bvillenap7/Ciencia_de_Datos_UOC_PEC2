Extremely bright light circle with vapor release, accompanied by small less bright lights above Fairbanks, AK;2001-08-27 05:30:00;10min+;Extremely bright light circle with vapor release, accompanied by small less bright lights above Fairbanks, AK I work with the US Post Office and always look at the sky before leaving home.  Today (8/27/01) when I stepped out my door I first looked at the eastern horizon and noticed the planet Venus.  Then I turned towards the North and noticed a very bright light high in the NW.  Odd because I knew there were no planets in that direction, and no stars that bright (about 2-3 times the brightness of Venus).  My first thought was should I go back in & get my binoculars, or just proceed towards work?  I went back in and got them.  They are Orion 9x63.  With them I expected to see only a point of light, as that is all I could see with my eyes (an apparently very bright, motionless star).  But I was suprised to see a disc.  The object had a visible diameter which immediately told me this was not a star (nova or otherwise).  I became immediately interested.  The color was pure white and very bright.  No details were visible within the bright image and for awhile no details surrounding it.  I kept watching debating whether or not to call my brother (hoping to get a triangulation) and not wishing to take my eyes off it when there was a sudden change.  I noticed the emergence of a puff of gray smoke off towards the northerly direction.  Inside this thin vaporus and expanding cloud were a number (6-12) of swimming points of light moving somewhat erratically in the same direction (generally northerly).  I then moved closer to the house and supported my arms on a step ladder to steady my view and the same event happened again, thoug the puff moved generally south and again about the same number of points of light moved off in that direction.  They did not seem to move off with any great rapidity.  The small points of light seemed to have variable brightness to them (some were brighter than others).  They did not seem to move with any purpose, but somehwat sluggishly and randomly and even seemed to slow somewhat the further they got from the bright disc, which never changed position or brightness the entire time.  Now I! really wanted to call my brother and get a triangulation, but just as I was about to do so the entire event ended with the abrupt fading of the entire scene.  Not fading, cutoff.  It just disappeared. The morning was calm, and partly cloudy.  The event was seen thru thin clouds perhaps at 10,000'.  The object was above these clouds the entire time and did not move while the clouds slowly moved in a generally ESE to WSW direction.  Knowing the two locations I stood at to view this event I later used a compass and plumb bob to find the horizon coordinates, which I estimate to be the following: Elevation: 72 deg Azimuth:  300 deg (NW) During Civil Twilight I have observed balloon flights from my house quite often.  This was not a balloon, at least not a hot air balloon.  Hot air balloon are easily identified and are usually accompanied by noise when the fuel is burned for lift.  Even at high altitued one can detect the flare event from from the burn.  If it was a weather balloon (or some reasearch balloon from the University of Alaska) then I would also expect it to have changed position somewhat during the 10 minutes I observed it.  I noticed absoultely no change in position.  There was also absolutely no noise during the entire event.  If it was a balloon venting at high altitude (accidental surface rupture, or deliberate puncture) then I do not understand why the bright central disc did not seem to change position or brightness during the release event.  I also do not understand why the entire event just shut off so suddenly. Thought you might find this interesting.;64.8565375;-147.759673076923
((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Mars.

My wife spotted it first I looked and at frst glance thought that it may be venus because it was just stting there and it was very bright.  Then I noticed it was slowly moving laterally.  It seemed to flicker like a quasar but it was too far away for me to get a distinct shape I am in army aviation so I dimissed rotary wing aircraft because the consume too much fuel to just sit it the air for no reason and they have a definite hovering appearance.  I am not sure if weather balloons have lights or why they would be that far from the university.  And lastly could it have been a hot air balloon?  Your guess is as good as mine please reply if you have some idea... I also call fairbanks airport operations and they said they had no idea?;64.8565375;-147.759673076923
5 objects danceing around in the sky that looked like balls of light. Fairbanks Ak.;2005-04-11 00:00:00;5 mins;5 objects danceing around in the sky that looked like balls of light. Fairbanks Ak. It was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  I had taken all the daycare kids outside to play. One of the boys (hes 9) looked up and saw something in the sky and was telling my daughter (6) to look. Well I looked up and seen 5 round shaped lights playing around in the sky. It looked like they were playing around. The sun was out. It was a clear blue sky. They danced around faded in and out and circled around. I called my husband who was inside to look at what we were seeing and asked if he could explaine and he couldn't it baffled us. My 12 year old daughter ran in to get her binoculars. Didgital camera had no bateries. (bummer) They were gone by the time she returned. They just disapeared. Sorry for the type o's I am writting this in a hurry. I do own and run a childcare so I had to type fast. I hope this info helps. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found her to be quite credible.  She and her husband appeared on the Jeff Rense radio program on Tuesday, April 12, 2005.

3 white orbs. 2 in front 1 behind.;2013-09-24 20:35:00;~2 minutes;3 white orbs. 2 in front 1 behind. I saw these whilst lying down in bed with my daughter's.  It was sunset, the sky was mostly dark and the first 2 came from the back side of my house along side each other-about north/east. They were not moving too fast but were traveling at a steady pace.  I followed them by running out to my living room when they went past my line of view.  They continued on their path until one seemed like it just slowly winked out eventually followed by the other. I went to go lay back down,  my oldest was tired,  when I saw the third.  This one came from the same direction but at a faster pace.  I didn't follow this one because my daughter needed me, but I wanted to. I am posting this now because I can not understand what this is,  and I have been trying to find out more about it. I have 2 videos of this incident, the first one is pretty shaky and my dog barked pretty loudly, but the second one is steady.  I may upload them to YouTube.;64.8565375;-147.759673076923
Strange orange lights moving unnaturally across the sky.;2013-10-04 20:00:00;10 minutes;Strange orange lights moving unnaturally across the sky. My 19 year old daughter called for me to come outside and see something unbelievable.    I went downstairs and my 13 year old son, my husband and a family friend were already on the porch.  We witnessed three orange crafts hover and move sideways.  We thought they may have been lanterns, but moved unnaturally.   We live north of Fairbanks on a small hill and we saw the lights southwest of the city.   We knew that we were seeing something extraordinary however, the whole event was surreal and when they vanished we were only left with the idea that we had to rationalize the event... But we just couldn't!;64.8565375;-147.759673076923
Eight small circular craft near surface, seen at Fairbanks, Alaska.;2015-12-31 23:55:00;20 minutes;Eight small circular craft near surface seen at Fairbanks, Alaska. On the evening of December 31, 2015, and into the morning of January 1, 2016, at Fairbanks, Alaska, I witnessed the following:   While driving my vehicle south on the Parks Highway, near the vicinity of the University of Alaska farm fields [Geist Rd and Parks Highway off ramps] I noted five objects rising from the left [west], at near-ground level and move across the highway at an altitude of 300-400 feet.  They appeared under independent control and seemed to be making a 5-sided 'sign' in their arrangement.  I initially assumed they were fireworks on parachutes. The time was just before midnight and fireworks were evident in this built-up area that includes residential and light commercial development.  The area of activity is between the Fairbanks International Airport and the University of Alaska. The objects were both stationary at one moment and then in motion as a unit. I stopped the vehicle, exited to the roadway for a better look.  There was no sound.  The objects appeared to be circular, 15 to 30 inches in diameter.  There were no other discernible details of surfaces.  Each appeared to be emanating a red/yellow glow or pulse that remained constant.  The 'fire' color conformed closely with the area where it was coming from.  The light appeared to make a small protruding tail to the steady pulse/glow. It was brighter at the center. Over a period of 20 minutes, I continued to observe the phenomenon.  The objects did not dip, as a helicopter does when it moves forward.  Once climbing, they did not move to a lower level.  The original 5 units slowly climbed into the sky, spread out, moved to the east [toward U. S. Army Fort Wainwright].  The lights appeared to blink out and the craft vanished in the darkness. After stopping, I had doubled back on the highway, and stopped again, where I noticed three new craft, similar to the first five.  They were flying over the roadway in the same fashion to the others.  When near to the ground they were tightly grouped and as they climbed they spread out.  They, too, headed east, climbed higher and disappeared. I am aware that the University of Alaska has a DOD contract for development and testing of advanced drones.  During daylight hours I have observed a drone flight a few miles from this vicinity.  Further, as mentioned, DOD maintains a large post within 6 miles of the sighting location.   Additionally, DOD maintains Eielson AFB, 30 miles south-east of this location.;64.8565375;-147.759673076923
((HOAX??))  Bright, radiating orb above Littleton.;2016-09-18 14:34:00;69 seconds;Bright, radiating Orb above Littleton This is not a joke.   My significant other and I are really scared.  We were looking West, and an EXTREMELY bright orb appeared in the sky above the Mt. Evans area.  We were outside with our neighbor, who actually got BURNED by the heat emitted from the orb.  His skin was all red and blistery after the exposure to the orb--possible radiation?   I am religious, so I do not want to call it a UFO, but it was without a doubt, not of this world, or any.  It was close enough that my wife, ((wife's name deleted)), could feel the heat RADIATING off the orb on her face.  Please help.;64.8565375;-147.759673076923

Blue glowing disk with no center giving off bright green aura like exhaust.;2018-01-26 06:20:00;2 minutes;Blue glowing disk with no center giving off bright green aura like exhaust. It was flat like a Frisbee with no center.  The entire underneath was a blueish color.  It had a bright green (mistaked it for the aurora at first glance) gas like aura as it hovered, then it started to move.   Shortly after leaving a glowing gas cloud behind, it shot upwards which my photos show.  I frantically tried to get the camera set up.  Missed the glowing craft its self, but the exhaust photo corroborates my claim.  This thing was massive.  Several 747 jets could have fit within the circumference.;64.8565375;-147.759673076923
High altitude UFO over Fairbanks Alaska seen by 3 witnesses;2019-09-15 00:21:00;30 seconds;High altitude UFO over Fairbanks Alaska seen by 3 witnesses A friend and I were out taking pictures of the Aurora when I noticed an unusual light above us.  It was at least twice as bright as the nearest stars and I noticed it was moving. I quickly grabbed my tripod and camera and moved it so the object was in the field of view. As I was doing this the object appeared to increase speed and the light emitted or reflected from the object dimmed to red and faded out as it sped away. My camera was set up for a 10 second exposure on a 1 second delay and the image shows a streak of light from the object. Object was at very high altitude and not an aircraft that I’m familiar with. All of us present agreed it was like nothing we have ever seen. Object was travelling West Northwest. Object seemed to maneuver showing a less reflective surface as it sped away could possibly explain the light from the UFO and how it changed. Object did not display normal meteor characteristics, No aircraft or satellites were in the area either from searching online services. I can provide the photo which is unmodified.;64.8565375;-147.759673076923
