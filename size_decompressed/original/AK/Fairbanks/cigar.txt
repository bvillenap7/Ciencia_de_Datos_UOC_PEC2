It stayed in one place for a short time and then took off at a high rate of speed. My sister and I had gone to sleep for the night, when we were awakened by our room filling with light, as if a giant flash bulb had gone off in our window. Our heads were at the window. We looked over towards each other curiously, and then wordlessly, we rolled over, slid up the wall and peeked out of the window. I saw a cigar shaped, hovering, metal looking thing with evenly spaced lights running along the side. I think they were red, or redish. It stayed for a second or two and then left quickly at a rate of speed that I'd never seen before. It was out of sight in a matter of 2 or 3 seconds. We went downstairs and told our Mom. She said that it was probably a barium rocket that they were using to test the Aurora Borealus out at Poker Flats rocket testing range north of town.;64.8565375;-147.759673076923
