I didn't see much.  I have summarized what I saw in the sentence below. ((NUFORC Note:  No sentence appeared in the report below the sentence above.  Similar report from Hayward, CA, recently regarding an object emitting multiple, smaller objects.  PD));64.8565375;-147.759673076923
Girded Structured UFO with many lights spends 45 minutes hovering over Fairbanks, Alaska on January 13, 2005;2005-01-13 20:00:00;45 Minutes;Girded Structured UFO with many lights spends 45 minutes hovering over Fairbanks, Alaska on January 13, 2005 Semi Trapezoidal or Angular Platform like Structure, with many white opaque lights, was seen from the Wal~Mart employee parking lot at about 8 PM on January 13, 2005.   Spires with lights on them appeared to jut out from it's left side.  It was a clear night -44 Degrees Below Zero.  There was a slight breeze moving from left to right of viewing plane.  I estimate the breeze moving from East to West.  We were looking south from the parking lot.  The object hovered silently and stayed stationary regardless of the breeze.  After about 5-10 minutes the object began to move slightly toward the right of the viewing plane.  The object then stopped again and remained stationary.  While observing it I waited for ((name deleted)) to see it since I did not want to imply what I was seeing.  He then looked up where I was looking and asked, What the hell is that?  Be both observed it for a few more minutes then both decided to go home.  He drove up to murphy Dome Road and said it was no longer in his sight.  The object stayed stationary as we both went home.  The object was in my path as I drove home, moving toward it, so I watched it as I was driving home looking to see if it would get any bigger.  I am still not sure if it did get any bigger.  Later measurements seem to indicate that it did appear larger at my appartment.  At my appartment, I observed the object from my balcony and still was trying to explain it away.  I convinced myself that it was lights from a far away building I never knew existed before, and had a feeling that it would be there in the morning.  However, I convinced myself of this in spite that I knew it was a wrong assumption.  This was because the structure of the placement of the lights were sort of in a random pattern of distribution and that I had seen it moving.  I had a camera with me but assumed that it would be there in the morning.  I went to bed, due to exaustion, after 30 minutes had elapsed from the initial sighting to the balcony sighting even thought the object was still visible.    So my visual sighting took only about 30 minutes.  However, after a conversation with a Physics Personnel at the University of Alaska, Geophysical Institute, we obtained infrasound readings of what may be the object.  The infrasound readings indicate that there might have been an engine signature on Atmospheric Entry and then another signature on Exiting the Earths Atmosphere.  The infrasound readings obtained sounds well below human hearing levels.  Anyhow, two distinct readings do exist that happen to be approximately 45 minutes apart.  I am still in the process of obtaining weather radar data, and any other data possible.;64.8565375;-147.759673076923
My UFO Sighting: CE II;2005-01-13 21:00:00;45 Minutes;My UFO Sighting: CE II At 21:00 or 9:00 PM a coworker and I left work for the day and went to start up our vehicles in the associate parking lot of a local /chain retail store.  It was approximately -34 to -44 degrees below zero with a strong wind and dark.  It was colder inside our automobiles than outside so we waited outside our vehicles while they were warming up.  I looked up at approximately south, southeast (which was above the discount store building) to observe an object, in the shape of a trapezoid, that was large enough that it's bottom was 7 degrees above the horizon and it's top was 24 degrees above the horizon.  The object had a cluster of lights that were semi structured / semi randomly placed that apeared mother of pearl in color.  It was stationary regardless of the wind.     I waited to see if the other person observed it as well then he asked me if I was seing what he was seeing.  After observing it for about 15 minutes it moved 5 degrees to the right then went stationary again.  At this time our vehicles were warm so we both drove home.  It just so happens that I lived 1.4 miles in the direction of the object.  So I observed it getting larger as I drove toward it.  From the balcony of my appartment I observed it for another 15 minutes.  Then I went to sleep due to exhaustion.  I since then have taken GPS readings from both sighting locations.  With the help of University Scientists I have obtained Infrasound and Weather Radar Data.  The infrasound data may not be related based on university staff reccomendations.  Also, the infrasound readings are below audible levels.  I did not hear any noise. However two bars of infrasound do appear.  One bar at about 21:00 the other bar maybe 45 minutes later. (The one scientist that explained this to me became upset when I expressed my intention to report this data.) It is estimated that the object was 45 miles away and 4,000 feet above the earth. (?) With the help of three mathematicians I estimate the width of the object to be about 23.3 miles wide. ! It is t hought to be of a natural origin.  However, it did seem to exhibit some movement that suggests intelligent operation.  But I cringe at that speculation.  The creative part of me wants to elaborate and fill in the blanks.  But the logical side of me is struggling to explain it away as a natural phenomenon.   I have put together a 77 page book on it and sold one copy over ebay.  There is a quickly rendered photoshop picture, that I developed, with it.  Geography, B.A. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.  PD));64.8565375;-147.759673076923
((HOAX??))  Trapezoidal object seen in Fairbanks in 2005.;2005-01-13 21:00:00;45 minutes;Trapezoidal object seen in Fairbanks in 2005. From the Wal~Mart Parking lot looking south we observed a large Trapezoidal Object with multiple lights hovering in and coming toward us.   We observed it for 15 minutes then it moved 5 degrees to the right.  And hovered again for another 15 minutes.   After driving home I continued to observe it from my balcony for another fifteen minutes before I went to bed.    Infrasound readings taken of it seem to point to the fact that it had a low in audible sound like engines.  And that it disapeared after the 45 minutes were up.   Using trigonometry, GPS, and angles I estimated the object to be about 23 miles wide. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he reports that he did not take a photograph.  We are skeptical of the report, but the source assured us that it is a truthful rendition of what he experienced.  PD));64.8565375;-147.759673076923
