Glowing flashing orbs moving erratically.;2016-11-29 06:00:00;40 minutes;Glowing flashing orbs moving erratically. Looking out the window towards Homer we noticed the object above the tree line hovering for about 15 mins. It was flashing white red blue & balls of light dancing around each other fast. Grabbed the binoculars to get a better look and could see little trails of light as the balls darted around and then it seemed to move around barely at first then more and more erratic until it just sort of faded out into the distance towards Kachemak Bay out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke briefly via telephone with the source of the report, and he assures us that he sees the same, or similar, light in different areas of the sky, at the same time of morning.
