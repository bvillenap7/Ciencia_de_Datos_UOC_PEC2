Orange water;1969-07-05 10:53:00;17 minutes;Orange water we were on a family vacation in Alaska, it was my moms birthday and dad had chartered a fishing trip.  We left at about 7am and went out about 12 miles into the sound from Valdez.  at 10:53 I checked my watch because I saw an orange tint in the water and the captain had suggested we try another spot.  so four of us fishing for halibut started to retrieve our lines.  One fellow had caught a shark ... we killed it and threw it overboard just a moment before. Suddenly the water fourty feet from the boat exploded into the air and the water really turned orange for three hundred feet around the splash.  A disk shaped object with windows and lights shot up out of the water to about one thousand feet above.  It hovered there.  The next thing I remember is the water around the boat was teaming with sharks and i had hooked one. after gafing a four footer and returning it to the sea...i again checked my watch and it was 11:10.  we headed away from the spot and i asked the others if they saw the strange craft.  NO ONE remembered seeing it at all except for me. The craft was about 25 feet in diameter had a rotating edge around it  near the bottom which was dark in color like black sand. it was about six feet tall  with portholes or windows 3 feet apart on the main body of the craft which did not rotate. I think i should draw a picture instead. ((NUFORC Note:  We will ask the witness to submit his graphic of the object.  PD));61.101;-146.9
