They were in a shape similar to the Big Dipper.  They made no sound.  They were moving slowly, kind of bobbing high in the sky.  At the end of the sighting, each object left a streak, kind of like entering a warp/light speed.   I am a navy vet who worked on aircraft.  These objects did not move in a fashion consistent with any hovering or moving, jet, helicopter, or missile.  The objects emitted no lights in the fashion of aircraft (i.e. strobe lights/navigation lights);64.0382;-145.7508
