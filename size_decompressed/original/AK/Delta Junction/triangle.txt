Triangular shaped object with no noticeable noise and green lights.;2009-12-17 20:00:00;1 minute;triangular shaped object with no noticeable noise and green lights. On a December evening, I was driving home from Fairbanks, AK, to Fort Greely, AK, and noticed several 4-5 bright stars as they appear to my right off the Tanana River.  These stars were abnormally bright and seem to move however, at night in AK, you can see bright stars, but none like these. A few minutes of following the stars, I noticed something hovering above my car slightly out of view.  I could see the tip of what appeared to be something triangular in shape, with 4-5 green lights heading towards the mountains, no one lives in this areaâ€”it was moving towards Delta Junction/Fort Greely area.  The object was maybe several hundred feet above me and made no noticeable noise. Later, rather a few seconds later, I looked to my right, and the stars I had seen were gone.  I had no sense of fear I was oddly calm, I think I was in denial.  I talked to another person, but only 5 years later, and they stated they seen the same thing around the same period, but felt embarrassed to talk about it, too. I was the observer that night.   My background, I worked for the MDC on Fort Greely, AK, 2008-2010.  I am still not a believer of any kind or I am still in denial.
