25 feet from amber, orange orb [1986]  Alaska.;1986-11-15 14:30:00;2 minutes ?;25 feet from amber, orange orb [1986]  Alaska U.F.O  report, NOV. 1986  I was reading the report dated Nov. 7, 2012, Wasilla AK. About some orange orbs . And a lot more reports from all over. Those reports are very similar to what I saw back in Nov.1986 in Girdwood AK. The Wasilla delta report, [ Nov. 7 2012]   from Girdwood, is just over some mountains to the north, about 30 mile as the crow fly’s. What I saw that early morning ,Nov. 1986, being less then 25 feet at its closes point to me   this, single, silent, amber, orange orb , a perfect sphere . Translucent orange bubble with a kind of light  I have never seen. One report I read described the light perfectly. I quote , “ A quality of light had not seen before, a peculiar wavelength” unquote. I’ll add that I noticed that there were no rays of light in the glow of the orb. Look outside at any man made light at night and there will be some rays round it. Not so with this orb. Strange light . I was sleeping behind a bar in a camper shell .  Got up to relieve my self. Turning my head to the left where my chin was just in front of my left  shoulder . There was the orb, at about 20 feet in diameter, floating at tree top,[15 to 20 ft. high]  From my left, going to my right  down the row of trees that separate the two businesses. It moved very slow, until my chin was in front of my right shoulder then took off fast still in a straight line until it was over glacier creek, made a perfect 90 degree turn and straight to Turnagain arm a few miles south.  At that instant the deafening sound of an f-15 after burner shook the ground. The jet followed the path as the orb over the tree tops to glacier creek, but the jet had to cut the corner  to make the turn to pursue the orb.  Then a second f-15 ,shook the ground as its after burner came to life and took the same flight path on the tops of the trees.  It made a tighter turn then the first jet. I guess to make up time .   Those two Jets were so close I could see rivets on the under belly from the parking lot light. A foot note, seemed time was weird or something, stopping,  until the f-15’s appeared .;60.957;-149.1386
