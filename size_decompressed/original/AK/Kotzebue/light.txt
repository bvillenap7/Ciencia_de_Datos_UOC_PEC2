Walked outside for a smoke.  Looked over the sound which is frozen over this time of year.  There was a light moving slowly across the sound. I watched it and observed a smaller light drop out of it.  Straight down the light went and blanked out before it hit the sound.   The light in the sky continued for about a second more when it to blanked out.  The larger light seemed to dissipate getting smaller and smaller before it was gone from view.Both lights were bright white.   The larger of the to seemed to be oval in shape but it was radiating light on the outside so it was hard to tell and the smaller light that dropped look like a tear drop kind of like melting plastic and watching it drip but it was just once and white in color.   We live in a hub town and planes do not fly this early.;66.9007;-162.6058
