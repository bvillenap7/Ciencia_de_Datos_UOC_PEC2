My Brother and Sister in Law, told me that they saw several UFOS in Wrangell over the past months. I and my Daughter and sister traveled to my home town Wrangell, over the July 30th-Aug 10th duration. On the very first nite that we walked out on their deck my sister in law saw a bright white ball flying over her house towards the back, and she said look look there is one right now. we all looked and sure enough there was a huge bright white ball shaped ufo flying over her house, it went from about  middle of the sky, east, almost making it to the town. then we spotted two light green seafoam green small diamond shaped ufos that traveled in honeycomb circles, then slowly in half circles, then east to west very fast. They kept this formation all nite, sometimes moving extremly fast, sometimes moving slowly, then we saw over 20 , not all at once, but one at a time, ufos , they would just appear at one end ot the sky and travel to the other, and at one point dissapear in a spot of sky that had no stars in it that we could see. It was just a black part of sky. then my sister in law and my daughter and I were standing on her deck at about 3 am in the morning and a very large blazing white circle appeared out of no where , right in  front of us about 100 yards away. It appeared just out of nowwhere and it traveled from east to west. It was perfectly circular, it flew extremely in a straight line. then it stopped and dissapeared after flying about 300 yards , it just dissapeard . we heard nothing, only saw. I would like to know if anyone else in Wrangell has ever seen these ufos?? We cannot be the only people in Wrangell to see these?? And, if anyone else has seen them why no one ever talks about them??
