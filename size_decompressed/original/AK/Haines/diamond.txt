We all stopped and got out of the car to marvel at the stars. We were naming the various constellations that we could identify when we noticed this obviously flashing, rather than twinkling star, cruising across the night sky at a notable pace. I thought nothing of it just as my friends did. But as my curiosity faded, the flashing object (which was flashing blue-red-blue-white-blue-red-blue-white) had stopped suddenly right above the horizon.  I noted that this “thing” was no longer a satellite.  It was just stationary for maybe 2-3 minutes, until it started to bounce around in a bumblebee-like manner, almost if it were pacing in an infinity symbol or figure 8. It continued to just roam around the sky freely. Back and forth up and down side to side. This “satellite” then came to an abrupt stop. It just dropped very slowly and consistently downward and then to another stationary position. My friends were still sol! d on the idea of it being a satellite because, “Dude, satellites are advanced now the have propulsion. They can do whatever they want.” I argued the point of earth’s infinite orbit and how something in it could not have the capabilities to just stop. After that we were done marveling. I got in the car with a confidant feeling of “ I just saw a UFO!”;59.2512;-135.5499
