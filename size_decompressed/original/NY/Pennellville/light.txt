My eyes fixed on a moving light that I initially thought was the ISS but it seemed too low to the earth.  It traversed the sky in a steady direction and speed for about 1 minute and then it changed course.  Approximately 30 seconds after changing course the light suddenly faded to nothing.;43.2594;-76.2465
