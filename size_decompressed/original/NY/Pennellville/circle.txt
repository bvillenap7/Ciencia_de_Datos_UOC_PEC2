I could hear no sound, the light was constant, and  it had no trail behind it. She left and I proceeded to watch for roughly 2minutes as the object went across the sky and went out of view behind some pine trees. The object was bigger than any of the stars that were in the sky. Two Planes were spotted after with single flashing lights.;43.2594;-76.2465
