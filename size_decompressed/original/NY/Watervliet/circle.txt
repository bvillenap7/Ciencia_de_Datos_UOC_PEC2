In  Aug. 2013, six of my family were swimming and observed an object above us for approximately 20 min.   The  object was 500+ ft above and hovered then drifted easterly until out  of sight.;42.7310000000001;-73.7080999999999
Several flying objects observed in Albany county;2020-04-10 21:00:00;20 minutes;Several flying objects observed in Albany county I was taking my dog out for a walk I thought to myself when I was a kid I loved looking up at the stars threw a telescope and just being fascinated by it all so I decided to look up for awhile and just enjoy the view.  What cought my eye was this little dot dimmer then a star moving at a face pace (I kept having to look away so my eye could refocus because it wasn’t so bright).  I figured maybe it was a satellite or a military jet super high up till I seen it completely change course of direction( it was going East and went north in a flash) so I brought the dog inside went in my hunting gear and got my binoculars and came back outside thinking I’m crazy and seeing stuff.  I set up on the hood of my truck and waited a few minutes and out came another from the same direction going east so I pull my binoculars up to my face and watched.  It moved quick I watched it for a few seconds and it disappeared.  Then out came another then another same distance apart then disappearing.  I watched it happen at least 10 times but they all went straight and just disappeared. Went inside came out around 11 pm and seen one more this time it was headed south coming from the north.  I found this sight after googling and noticed somebody from Rochester ny kind of seen the same thing on the 8th so 2 days ago I figured I’d take the time to write this so maybe others will keep a look out and notice we’re not crazy.;42.7310000000001;-73.7080999999999
