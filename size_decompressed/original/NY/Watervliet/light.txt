There was four ufos in the sky.;2016-11-10 23:30:00;15 minutes;There was four ufos in the sky. I was driving home from my friends house and I turned down first street and as I was going down the street I saw 3 bright yellow lights in the sky going toward each other and then away from each other.  Then I saw a fourth one closer to me that heading in my direction,   I went to go get closer to it and I lost it.;42.7310000000001;-73.7080999999999
Pulsing white light travels left to right, disappears;2018-06-09 01:11:00;1 minute;Pulsing white light travels left to right, disappears Very early yesterday morning, I was in my back yard, at approximately 0110 Hrs. doing some stargazing. I was looking generally to the north, with large trees to the extreme left and right of my field of view, and a two-story neighbor's house in the center.  I had observed several high flying passenger aircraft (typical light/strobe pattern), satellites and a meteor or two. Suddenly, from behind the left hand bunch of trees, travelling from left to right, at a viewed angle to just clear the top edge of the neighbor's roof, appeared a VERY bright white (PULSING, not flashing) light.  The pulse pattern was: (gradual increase, hold a second or so, gradual decrease)(3 second pause)(repeat)  The time from minimum to maximum brightness was about 2-3 seconds.  Pulsing was not quite regular, but not random either.  The color of the light was absolutely one the purist whites I have experienced. I would estimate the distance to be middle distance, as it wasn't at airliner flight level, appearing much lower in altitude and close. I thought maybe it MIGHT be a helicopter, but there was ZERO noise. We have an Army National Guard base nearby, and UH60s overfly regularly, as well as the local Lifeflight.  They make a racket all the time, and I am quite familiar with helicopter noise.  During this event, however, there was NO SOUND/DEAD QUIET.  In addition, there were ZERO other strobes, anti-collision or flashing lights observable.  The light was about the size of a nickel held at arm's length, gliding along at a slightly sedate pace.  The path was a straight line path from left to right, until is disappeared behind the right hand set of trees.  It FAILED to appear where I estimated it should based on course and speed.  I quickly moved in my yard to see if I could re-locate it, but no luck. Now, during the last few seconds before it disappeared behind the trees, I was able to observe the object with my binoculars.  What appeared in my view was a neon blue...Aura? Haze?, and within this haze was a tumbling, jet-black multi-faceted rectangular-ish shape.   Confused by the blue light, I pulled my binocs away, and that is when the object disappeared behind the trees. I can honestly say this is one of the most unusual & unnerving things I have ever seen.;42.7310000000001;-73.7080999999999
Two daytime sightings of glowing orb-like objects within a short period of time;2019-02-28 16:24:00;15 seconds;Two daytime sightings of glowing orb-like objects within a short period of time On 28 Feb 2019, at 1615 Hrs I was outside taking photographs of passing airliners using my Nikon CoolPix P900 (Superzoom) camera.   The sky was clear & bright blue with some high-level haze and thin high-altitude clouds.  The temperature was about 35 Deg F. At roughly 1624 hrs, I noticed a bright orb-like light or object appear to my right at 75* elevation, moving from right to left.  Speed was moderate.  As the orb moved, it slowed considerably, almost to a stop, seemed to emit or discharge some type of liquid or mist that dissipated in the atmosphere, continued for another couple of seconds before it abruptly faded from view.  The liquid or mist was not a flare or fireball.  Before fading, I quickly lifted and pointed my camera without using the viewfinder and took some photos in the general direction of the object.  The orb did not leave a contrail like an airplane or make any sound/engine noise.  I continued observing the sky and taking pictures of airplanes. Then, around 1700 Hrs, as I was facing due west, I noticed the same (or similar looking) glowing orb again suddenly appear in my line of vision, 30* elevation, moving straight down before fading away.  There was no contrail or noise. I again quickly raised my camera and took some shots as it was moving downward, thinking I might catch something. Later, while reviewing my pictures, I discovered that I had managed to capture a total of four photos showing what seem to be the objects, two from the first sighting, and two from the second. I am an Army vet, and I am quite familiar aircraft recognition.  I have also been observing aircraft with my photography for about a year now.  I am quite familiar with how airliners, drones, helicopters, birds, stars, planets, meteors and errant mylar balloons look, in life and in my photos.  I can say, with all the sincerity that I have, that the objects I observed were none of these.  I do not know what they were, but they were highly unusual. Total observation time of both objects was approximately 15 seconds total.;42.7310000000001;-73.7080999999999
