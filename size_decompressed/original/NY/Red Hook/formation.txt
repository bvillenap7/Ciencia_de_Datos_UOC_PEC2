Driving from Ossining, NY, to Amherst, MA, on Taconic State Pkwy North at night on Sunday.   Myself and the other individual in the car first saw an incredibly strange brief flash in the sky--like a a bolt of lightening only orange like a flame and not extending from the sky/cloud to the ground but contained in the sky (I have nothing to compare it to because I've never seen anything like it).  A bit later on, after passing Red hook, closer to I-90 East, I saw three groups of three white orbs, somewhat faint, floating in the sky (too clear and bright to be confused for stars).  After about 3 minutes they just dimmed and faded out but not simultaneously, in succession. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous provides little contact information.
