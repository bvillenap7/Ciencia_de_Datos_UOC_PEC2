It started out dim and flickering a little, and then grew brighter and brighter as I stared at it, until it was a bright fireball. I thought it might be a floating paper lantern, but the light got too bright, and perfectly round, and it was moving too fast and too straight.  There were no sounds.   As soon as I realized what it was, I ran back to the apartment to get my boyfriend and his daughter.  Since he had already seen one with me before, only his daughter came out with me.  She saw it with me in the other side of the sky, through the trees, where it had been heading, and now a little lighter orange and flickering a bit again.  And then it disappeared.  I ran up ahead to see if it continued on towards the horizon, but it was totally gone, just like our first sighting a few weeks ago in Cassidaga, NY, on or about July 27th (unreported).;42.0052;-73.8577
