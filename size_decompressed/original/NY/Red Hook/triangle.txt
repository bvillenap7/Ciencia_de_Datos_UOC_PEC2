4 V-shaped orange objects in the sky.;2014-06-28 21:45:00;15 minutes;4 V-shaped orange objects in the sky. Looking outside my patio window, I noticed an orange reflection through the trees in our back lawn.  I thought it was strange but figured it was someone using a light to fish in the pond beyond the trees, so I disregarded it. About a couple of minutes later my daughter came in the house from work and seemed excited about something.  She said dad, you have to come outside and see this. I asked her what she saw.  She said, there's something in the sky, and I don't know what it is.  I went out and we moved across the lawn to where we could see above the trees. We observed 4 orange V-shaped objects in the sky moving NNW at a slow speed in a irregular formation.  The fourth object seemed to be trailing the other three.  At first I thought they may be helicopters, but there were no navigational lights on them.  They were moving too slow for any aircraft I'd be familiar with, jet, prop, or rotor wing.  They didn't change direction.  We watched them until they disappeared. As a retired military officer, I'm very familiar with aircraft, both civilian and military.  They were about 45 degrees from the horizon.  Not knowing the altitude, it would be a difficult guess as to how large they were.  I would estimate that they would be as large as a private jet.  I would estimate speed of about 70-85 mph. The sky was clear, no clouds, no haze.;42.0052;-73.8577
