Lighted object crosses entire sky in less than 30 Seconds;2007-08-04 21:39:00;30 Seconds;Lighted object crosses entire sky in less than 30 Seconds 4 People witnessing a lighted flying object flying from southwest to northeast.  The object moved across the entire sky in less than 30 seconds.  Was amazingly fast.  Thought it was a shooting star at first but object never faded and light stayed consistent through the entire flight path.  All 4 people were captivated by the speed this object was moving.  Was incredible!!!!!  About 10 minutes later it appeared that a jet was taking the same flight path but moving much slower.  The altitude of the first object seemed very high in the sky....the jet that followed 10 minutes later appeared to be flying lower, but in the same pattern.;43.2142999999998;-77.9392000000003
