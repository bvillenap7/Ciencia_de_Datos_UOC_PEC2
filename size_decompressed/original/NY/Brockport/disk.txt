Metallic saucer cruises slowly, a little ways above tree top level , North to South, stops and houvers. Silent and hangs up there without falling. The two of us got out of vehicle on Canal Road directly underneath craft and view with binoculars, but craft not that far up any way. Gray, dome on top, red blinker at one end, green blinker at other end, and white blinker light goes slowly all around ship. When tipped back, we see underneath 3 sets of dual, bright white banks of light going on and off in sequence. Ship starts to move and glides over town. Camera has no film. We follow and stop car on steel deck bridge and see same craft land in open field, about 400 yards out. Passing cars would not stop as we wanted more witnesses. Started to rain and we went home. Did not see any statements in local paper during week. Years later, I figured out why it stopped and turned away from flight path . There was in visual distance, a small air field with private small airplanes taking off, circling and landing. I guess the pilots didn't want to be seen.
