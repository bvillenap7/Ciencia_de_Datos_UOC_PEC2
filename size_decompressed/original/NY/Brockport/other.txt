Flash and then a trail in the sky.;2020-09-09 05:37:00;9 seconds;Flash and then a trail in the sky. Returned home from walking dogs.  Nearly pitch black save moonlight from half moon.  I was bent over to unleash dogs and a bright light engulfed my surroundings. I thought it might be lightening.  I looked up and saw what appeared to be a vertical stream of disturbed air in the western sky, similar to what a plane leaves behind.  The stream was much lighter in appearance to the darker surrounding sky and looked like tiny particles.  There was no airborne vehicle to be seen.  The stream faded quickly within 9 seconds or so, all together.  It did not start to fade at one end then the other, but rather the entire anomaly very uniformly.  My dogs did not seem to notice the account, especially when they would normally be frightened of lightening and the subsequent thunder.;43.2142999999998;-77.9392000000003
