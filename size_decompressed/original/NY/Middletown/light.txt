I am currently viewing a bright light above middletown ny. The light is very bright and not an aircraft. I know this because I viewed and aircraft flying to the left and beneath it and it has not moved. I also see no stars anywhere.;41.4815094827594;-74.3553596551731
Blue light slowing moving north and rapidly disappeared.;2012-03-05 20:05:00;5 seconds;Blue light slowing moving north and rapidly disappeared. So me and my brother were driving back from the store and was at the stop light,  While looking forward I noticed a big blue light that flew straight ahead (Headed north) really fast and disappeared,  I turned to my brother and I noticed he saw what I saw and we both looked at each other with blank face.  At first I thought it was a shooting star but it was way to big and I’ve seen shooting star before,  I could feel my heart pounding and knew right away it was more then that..;41.4815094827594;-74.3553596551731
distant bright twinking light shifting colors moving/drifting erratically.;2016-11-26 23:30:00;1.75 hours;distant bright twinking light shifting colors moving/drifting erratically At approximately 11:30pm, as I was using a computer, I noticed a distant bright light moving in the window, twinkling in various rapidly-changing colors, starting at approximately 140 degrees SouthEast (according to a Garmin GPS watch).  Colors included red, blue, purple, cyan, and occasionally green.  The object's movement and color changes were both erratic, becoming less so as the object became more distant. A second observer observed the movement of the object for a few minutes at approximately midnight.  The observer noted “yeah, that's weird all right.”  By 1:15am the object had risen several degrees in the sky and had moved further South to approximately 155 degrees SouthEast, the movement and color changes both much less pronounced, now dimmer but still being brighter than the rest of the stars in the sky. This event was just like what I witnessed on October 14th at 3:45am (report S130618) from the same location.;41.4815094827594;-74.3553596551731
