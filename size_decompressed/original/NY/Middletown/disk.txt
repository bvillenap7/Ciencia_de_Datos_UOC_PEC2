Intense glowing white/blue light.;2015-11-17 01:05:00;5 minutes;Intense glowing white/blue light It was what seemed to be a huge saucer shaped craft but the first thing that caught my eye was the fact that it was shining very intense bright white/blue light.  I had to stop driving and pull over it was so incredible. Before it disappeared into the clouds the bright light disappeared and I was able to see the actual crafts shape.  It had no wings and had to be way bigger than you're common ARV.  Incredible!;41.4815094827594;-74.3553596551731
