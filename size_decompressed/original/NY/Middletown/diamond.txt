I lived at the time in the Imperial Gardens Apartments in Middletown, N.Y in 1989, sitting in my apartment my daughter came in crying.  She said there's a UFO following them.  I remember that my wife took the girls to the movies.  They were coming home, when my daughter saw that there was a UFO following them! I went out to the parking lot to meet my wife, and looked up, I saw a Diamond shaped UFO with lights around the inner part of the UFO.  It was moving slowly.  My family and I were not the only ones that saw it, many of our neighbors were sitting out and they also witnessed this with us and one person took out her camcorder and recorded this.
