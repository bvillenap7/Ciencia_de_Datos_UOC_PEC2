Object dips up and down and zig zags.;2010-09-04 20:51:00;3 sec.;Object dips up and down and zig zags. I was looking into the sky when I saw an object moving through it,more of a bright light like a star due to the objects distance.   At first I thought it was a shooting star but all of a sudden the object dipped down, went back up,did a small zigzag and then straightened out and disappeared.  The sighting was very brief, about 3 sec.   Probably something easily explainable but I never saw anything like it before.

Dot of light just brighter than a star, undulating and drifting in the sky unlike any aircraft.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD));2016-10-14 03:45:00;2.75 hours;dot of light just brighter than a star, undulating and drifting in the sky unlike any aircraft At approximately 3:45am, I saw through the window what looked like a star in the sky which was moving and undulating with jerky movements unlike any aircraft, and which shimmered with bright light which varied in color from white-with-blue-hue (most of the time) to occasionally red-ish and green-ish colors.   At about 4am I went outside to continue observing--mostly to try to figure out if it was a high-flying small copter drone, which was the only thing I could think of which could have similar jerky movements in all directions.  The Little Dipper was just to the right of where the object was moving around in the sky. I occasionally saw little poof flashes of red light nearby to but not part of the object, like it had let out a silent firecracker.  At approximately 5am I went back inside to mention the event to a friend, and to get a pair of binoculars to try to make out a shape of the object.  Unfortunately all I could make out of the object through the binoculars was a bright white light with a blue hue -- not any detail as to its shape.  The friend came outside and observed the object from ~5:30am-5:45am, going back inside after feeling chilled.  I remained outside observing until 6:30am.  From 6am-6:30am the movements of the jobject seemed more subtle than earlier and was slightly less bright, so I assume it was moving away from my observing location.  If this was some kind of surveillance drone it would have had to be one that was brightly illuminated, could dart around like a nimble quadcopter, and stay aloft continously for 2.75 hours.;41.4815094827594;-74.3553596551731
