It was a little smaller than the moon and my original thought was it was like a flickering candle flame shaped like a ball.   I was driving so I kept my eyes on the road while glancing at the thing in the sky.  When we reached our driveway we got out and watch it recede -- still in a straight line -- while another plane taking off from Stewart Airport (in nearby Newburgh) was flying the opposite direction at a slight angle.  When the thing became small in the distance (still bigger than a point-like star) it just turned off.   We waited a bit to see if it would come on again but it didn't.;41.4815094827594;-74.3553596551731

It was blazing brighter red toward the center, and had a lighter, but yet still bright red trail around the outside.  It was not of any particular shape, but seemed to look the shape of how tips of campfire burns.   Called my daughter out to look, and she ran towards the open yard to see it better, and it dimmed out slowly, disappearing.;41.4815094827594;-74.3553596551731

They, as well, were diagonal from each other, one up higher than the other.   Ran again to open yard, and they'd both dimmed and faded away after another minute.;41.4815094827594;-74.3553596551731
