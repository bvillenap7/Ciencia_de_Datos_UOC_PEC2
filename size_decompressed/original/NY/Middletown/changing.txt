My husband and I then looked through binoculars and saw red (I saw some blue lights too, he didn't ) lights that looked like sparks under it.   Then at approximately 10:00 pm it changed completely to a sphere shape with circles.  Light was illuminating through some circles in a cross pattern with the brightest light in the center.
