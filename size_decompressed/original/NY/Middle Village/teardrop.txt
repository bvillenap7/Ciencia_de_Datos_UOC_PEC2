Saw very bright lights being totally stationary and not moving above my place here in Queens N.Y.;2020-01-16 15:00:00;Still There;Saw very bright lights being totally stationary and not moving above my place here in Queens N.Y. I noticed a very bright light in the sky, that was in the shape of a line, with a couple of lights in a row.  The weird thing is that it just was stationary and not moving.  Since this is a very big city, I cannot imagine that I’m the only one who is seeing this? *** I have the latest I phone 11 and I started taping all this on video of which I have. ( A couple of different videos ).                                                                                                            The 2nd part of this is....  almost every day, where I live , planes landing at LaGuardia Airport, fly low right above where I live.  I didn’t see or as of right now, any planes in the air?  Then I noticed a plane in the air, but it was flying in a direction I have never seen a plane fly from left to right, and seem like it was flying kind of towards the bright lights in the sky , that was suspended in mid air without moving?  Then my wife came out and she saw the same thin! g? She got really bothered by this, she didn’t want to keep looking at it and went inside.                                                                                                                                                           Now after she left , I tried to find that plane I saw. So again I started to video this and a smaller green light appeared, and it was flying around, but it started to BOUNCE ALL AROUND...back and forth. I also have video of this happening, that you can see it, doing this that lasted quite a while.                                                  I’m so glad I have this on video tonight while it’s happening.                                                                                There has to be an explanation of what this is?   Is it a UFO : maybe... to me it is unidentifiable flying object.  Maybe not from another place in the universe, probably man made?                                                                   I rea! lly don’t know what I should do with this, but it’s on video a! s plane as day.  To be sure I’m going to save this to the cloud and send 2 copies of these videos to my wife and a friend.                                                          Did you get any other report’s on this today from any one else in the NYC Area?                                                  Please if you have any suggestions for me on what to do or just drop it? Please let me know.    The last thing I want to do is to look like some kind of wack job!    I don’t know how ya would get back to me but if it’s possible, please do.;40.7205;-73.8796
