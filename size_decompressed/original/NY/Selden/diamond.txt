Triangular hovering unknown tracked by multiple craft;2012-01-04 19:30:00;15 minutes;triangular hovering unknown tracked by multiple craft I am a gazer and enjoy a clear night to locate and identify many objects and position in my little section of the sky. In 20+ years I have become familiar with an assortment of craft sharing our LI skies. I can recognize the difference between the Yaphank and South Hampton US military equipment performing maneuvers(usually during late evenings) and know where their insallations are located vs passenger liners en route to and from Islip Int'l Airport, JFK and LaGuardia airports by  regulated identification marker lights.  I know the distinctive nightime sounds of chopper blade rotation and winged craft props, jet exhaust rumbling, etc. operated by NY Suffolk County Police and various NEWS choppers, instantly, when vectoring over my area.  So, I have become unimpressed by their appearance due to familiarity. On Jan. 4, 2012 at approximately 7:30 pm EST I became aware of the unusual amount of aircraft traffic flying in unfamiliar patterns over Western LI . I was alarmed by the number of visible craft flying in a seemingly congested space at various altitudes and unusual patterns ranging from N-S, W-E, W-N, NE-S.  During the next few hours, I watched multiple craft flying varying directions in distances of 1 mile to 5 miles(ed. guess)from my location. The patterns, criss-crossing pilot maneuvers, low altitude banking and deliberate circling about kept my attention and was unsettling. Description of moving craft lights varied from single solid amber to solitary white strobe, some( I think they may have been choppers) strobed white AND red flashers. There were low flying, fast-moving craft outfitted with huge double tiered solid red lights positioned aft. It was hard to distinguish which craft made which sound. On Jan. 5,2012 (night #2) I again witnessed multiple white and amber lights in the W-S/W sky at approximately 7:30 pm.  I am aware that Venus was low in the evening sky at similar location.  This was not Venus......unless Venus can somehow switch from her familiar bright, head spotlight look into an upturned, spinning triangular shape with the ability to hover over the same area. Many craft were scrambling in all directions, again.  Why?  I have no idea. I blogged News12 on Jan. 6, 2012 asking if I was alone in my sighting - if someone could tell me what was that??  I continue to watch multiple craft (I think military) in the sky from dusk 'till 2:00 am EST.  After that, its quiet. Any information would help ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.8710000000001;-73.0510000000001

We went outside and looked to see what could have caused the vibration.  We live on a very high street so it could not be a truck. we looked up and to the south of long island we could see a bright red light [very large] and a smaller one below it.  We took pictures of this and as of right now it is still there, 20 minutes now.  The light stayed steady but would glow brighter slowly and then go back.it looked to have red branches on the southern side of it that branched out.its wasnt so much a pulsating light but there was a definite pattern to it.changing approx every [2] minutes [EST].  It is a much brighter red on the rim and a lighter red on the inside, the smaller one is to low to really see what it is doing.  The pattern would be very bright foe 5 seconds and then dim.  The pattern then changed to bright red staying longer,[approx [4] min by watch.as i write this the vibration had stopped after 5 to 10 seconds and nothing since. we are going back out to see if it is still there.  This cannot be a plane or a tower light we can see that also [the tower light] it is very large and seems quite low.with our cell phones we can actually see it turning shapes like a worm for lack of a better word.  It stays in that unformed way twisting and seems circular but not solid.after approx 5 min its then glows into a huge red mass pulsating approx 3x and then goes into a unformed weird worm movement,yet you can see in the video it looks fluid not solid.  We have a 10 minute video.  It is still out there with the smaller one under it quite far away from the top one doing the same movements.;40.8710000000001;-73.0510000000001
