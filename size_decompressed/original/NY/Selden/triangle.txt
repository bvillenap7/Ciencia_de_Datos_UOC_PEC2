Dark triangle with orange lights seen in Selden NY;2017-07-16 23:45:00;2 minutes;Dark triangle with orange lights seen in Selden NY Me and my father were driving back from dropping off my grandmother at her apartment and above the trees we saw a dark object in a triangle shape moving slowly along.   There were 4 orange lights to outline the hape of the thing.  I thought the orange lights were the same color as orange flares that I had seen recently before and had filmed.  These orange lights moved together in this triangle shape and disappeared behind the trees.   We didn't see it anywhere after this.   I'm a total skeptic and not assuming this was an alien ship from another world, but it was very very odd, and slightly unsettling.   My dad was more alarmed than me.  He kept saying what the hell is that?!;40.8710000000001;-73.0510000000001
