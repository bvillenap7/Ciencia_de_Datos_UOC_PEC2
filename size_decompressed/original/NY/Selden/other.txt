The was a common thing for us to do and gave us a good time to talk.My mother first noticed a star moving and said look a satalite when she pointed it out to me I saw what appeared to be a star moving. We watched it till it stopped and made an abrupt 90 degree turn moved just a little bit and then made another abrupt 90 degree turn then vanished. I could be wrong but ive never seen satalites do this before. It looked like any other star not real bright and no distinct color just white. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Then, I saw it was flying in my direction.  As it got closer, I saw it was a very bright glowing light of a aircraft.  As it got closer, I saw it was not an aircraft, as we know one, but a shape like our pentagon, almost.   It was silent, with very intense bright rings of amber pink circles, of the exact same size of each other.  It hovered at about 1000 feet or more above me silent, and then moved hovering in a north east direction. At that point, I tried to follow it in my jeep, but lost it, as it gained altitude and headed north very fast.   I would also like to mention about five years ago at the old Grumman's site in Calverton, NY, as i was watching sky divers floating down, I noticed something following down above them and quite close.  It looked like quarter lenght of a telephone pole, very gracefully moving about 100 feet above the ground and hangars.   At first, I thought possibly some one had a jet pack on.  As i got closer, I saw it was just a pole floating and hovering.  Then, after about 4 minutes, it gained altitude, and flew south east out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere about his sighting.  We suspect that it is a reliable report of what he had witnessed.
