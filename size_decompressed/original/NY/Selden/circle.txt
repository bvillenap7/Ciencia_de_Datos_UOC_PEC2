Strange object moved across almost the entire night sky, looked like a star, but wasn't.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS?  PD));2010-07-09 22:12:00;30 seconds;Strange object moved across almost the entire night sky, looked like a star, but wasn't Friday, @ 10:12pm on 7/9/10, I was sitting outside my home and looked up into the night sky.  I saw something that looked just like any regular star in the sky move across almost the entire night skyline until it dimmed and disappeared.  It was too far away and small with no other lights to be a plane.  It had no trail streak behind it, nor did it move fast enough to be a shooting star.
