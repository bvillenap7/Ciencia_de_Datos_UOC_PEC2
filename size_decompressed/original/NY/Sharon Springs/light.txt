Bright lights in Sharon Springs, 1995.;1995-05-20 19:00:00;5-6 hours;Bright lights in Sharon Springs 1995. My husband, myself, and our 3 daughters where at home in the living room.  Through the north facing picture window a bright light appeared.  We gathered at the window as the light became brighter and brighter until it seemed as though it could be emanating from the walls themselves.   As we peered out the window, there was at least 3 large lights moving very fast toward the house.  I was trying to reach one of my daughters hands...  Motion slowed down like trying to move through a thick clear substance with a wave motion.   The next thing we remember was that we were trying to clear off the dinner table until I realized it was near 1am.  I told the girls to go to bed.   Upon waking in the morning, none of us had any recollection of any of this...not until afternoon when my husband asked if I remembered anything about bright lights and wondered if it was just a dream.   Then the memories flooded back.  During the entire day we were all wondering what the massive influx of army helicopters flying over the house was all about.   We were then approached by a neighbor who had also seen bright lights the night before.   Being a retired colonel, he had made a number of phone calls to inquire about the helicopters.  At first they told him there were no helicopters in the area.  When he could actually give the numbers off the bottom of the aircraft, they blocked his calls.   My husband died the next week in a construction accident. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.7611;-74.5885
