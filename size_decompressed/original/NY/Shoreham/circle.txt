Swooping star, you'd have to see to believe.;2008-06-21 22:30:00;3 seconds;Swooping star, you'd have to see to believe. It was star shaped, however, closer than any star I've ever seen. When I was talking to my neighbor I noticed this yellow, blue & pinkish star swooping down then curving upwards. I told my friend to look up , but it was too late. This UFO disappeared faster then I could utter the words. I've never seen anything like it, but my friend & my wife didn't take me seriously, but I'll never forget what I saw. This was what they write about. It will never be credible. That's why it will never be real.  BUT that doesn't mean it didn't occur.;40.948;-72.8929
