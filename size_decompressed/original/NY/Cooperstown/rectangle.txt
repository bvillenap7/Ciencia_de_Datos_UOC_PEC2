Was at the public boat launch at Otsego Lake, closest to the village taking pictures of the skies since they had just cleared up from a day and a half of rain.  As I was taking photos of the sunset (looking west) I noticed a slow flying white object quietly skimming through the air.  Its movements were smooth and it was travelling from north to south.  I had my phone camera and decided to zoom as far as I could with it and take a picture.  I couldn’t determine that it was a rectangle until I looked closer at the photo today just by chance.  Using extra zoom I could enlarge the photo enough to see that it was indeed a white rectangle (not a blimp like I considered) and on the bottom it had a bright amber reflection (lights?).  There was also a haze encasing all sides of the object.   It flew off and slightly turned more south.  Only today did I realize the photo that I had.  I am an adult female, 52 years old, and a hobby photographer.  This is the first time!  I’ve caught a photo like this.  As a child I saw 3 UFO’s, with bright pink lights, jumping up and down in one area and zigzagging and seeming to follow my friend and I.  Scared the heck out of us.;42.7024000000001;-74.9201999999999
