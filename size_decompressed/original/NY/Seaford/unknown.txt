through it was a shooting star but was brighter and larger than usual.;2008-12-17 23:00:00;5 seconds;Though it was a shooting star, but was brighter and larger than usual. I was driving my car about 20-25 mph on a side street when suddenly I saw what looked like a shooting star.  It flew over head in a pretty straight line heading North.  It looked very high up in the sky therefore, I didn't see exactly what shape but it seemed like a sphere, but again it was moving incredibly fast.   I have seen shooting stars before and this was larger and much brighter and closer to earth than a star.  The object was a bright blue color that left a trail.   So in conclusion to me and my friend who observed this at the same time, this seemed more like a UFO sighting than a shooting star, or any type of plane.  I have never seen anything like this.  It was basically gone in a blink of an eye.;40.6785;-73.4948
