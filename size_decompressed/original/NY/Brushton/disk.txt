I went outside to feed the dogs and heard a low humming above and in front of me.  I looked up to see a disc-shaped craft coming towards me fast, it stopped a few hundred feet above and behind the power lines, hovered a second, then took off faster then I've ever seen anything fly.  Up close...if you blinked you missed it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be both sincere, and serious-minded.  We have posted his photo to our website, although we have no idea what the object in the photo is.  We allow for the possibility that the anomalous object could be a bird, with its wings swept far forward.  The lack of symmetry suggests to us that the object may not be an alien spacecraft.
