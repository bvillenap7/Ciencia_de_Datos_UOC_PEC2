Triangular object with three lights over  Westchester county NY;2007-10-29 20:53:00;5 seconds;Triangular object with three lights over  Westchester county NY Could not see Craft in full, was too dark.  I did see three lights, white, not very bright(brighter amd larger than anything else in area)lined out as the points of an equilateral triangle.(there was a darker shape they were attached to, but I could only make out the lights on the craft)  obhesct was heading norh -north east towards CT.  Obect traversed my vision of the sky (from south to north, roughly 50 miles, maybe more in a matter of five to six seconds.   ONE NOTE:  Object had to have passed no farther than 20 miles of the Westchester county Airport!  traveling through a VERY BUSY Plane route.( Planes from Westchester county airport, Laguardia Airport, and JFK Airport ALL fly through this area.  Object WAS NOT flying in ANY normal Aircraft route ( I stand outside smoke everynight watching the planes and looking for shooting stars, I know this was no plane, wrong altitude, and traving much faster than even teh military planes that go through now and then.  Craft also did not have any strobes, just three white lights.  I did see at least three planes that were in the area at the same time, craft flew, at a distance, directly in front of one plane(I belive that plane to be heading towards Westchester county by it's altitude.;41.1903;-73.6362
Football sized UFO over the town of Bedford;2013-01-03 06:45:00;3 minutes;Football sized UFO over the town of Bedford while i was driving to work, which is on Guard Hill Road in Bedford, i noticed a huge, football sized UFO in the shape of a triangle/pyramid.  I could not believe my eyes.   This happened last thursday,january 03, 2013.   As soon as i took my camera phone to take a picture, the object had disappeared only leaving a trail of white, cloud-like  condensed air.   I received a phone call on Saturday, January 05, 2013 by a colleague of mine.  He called me to tell me that he, too, had seen the UFO except that he saw it in the town of Mount Kisco, NY. which is 15 minutes from Bedford.;41.1903;-73.6362
