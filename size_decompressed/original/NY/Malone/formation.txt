Three fuzzy Gold Objects in Formation flying by in 20 seconds;2018-08-12 22:45:00;20 seconds;Three fuzzy Gold Objects in Formation flying by in 20 seconds About 9:45pm.  We were watching falling stars, then out of the North sky these three objects appear in formation.  They were Gold in color round but Fuzzy from the bottom.  The three objects were about 1/2 mile up in sky and zoomed across in less than 20 seconds in a straight line heading south.  There was no sounds. My wife looks at me and said what was that? I told he UFO....   This is my second time seeing things like this.  Every night, I watch falling stars and I see about 6-8 satellites go by and we also have the airport from Montreal next by.  This was definitely a group of UFO's going somewhere.;44.8509000000001;-74.2927
