circle/round object above field in upstate ny.;2000-08-07 22:10:00;30secs or more;circle/round object above field in upstate ny. i was going home from work on a back road. i work at a prison nearby. i hadnt gone very far and something caught my attention out of the corner of my eye. i looked to my left and i saw what was a line of lights in the sky above a field, or so it appeared to me at first. as i looked at it wondering what the heck it could be, it dawned on me and i immediately wanted to cry. as i looked i realized it wasnt a row of lights after all, it was a cicular object with lights around it. large bright white lights, square in shape. they seemed to rotate around the object. also the object itself seemed to be rotating, but that could have been an illusion becouse of the lights. i could faintly make out the bottem of it which appeared to be flt, only becouse it had a different shade of black from the night sky. it moved very slowly. i dont think it cared if it was seen. and now that i think about it, there was no sound. i remember thinking that there was a lot of people leaving work at the surrounding jails and somebody else had to see this. i pulled my car off the road and was going to get out and it slowly dissappeared. it didnt take off fast like you hear, it just dissappeared. it wasnt real high in the sky. im terrible on judging distance but i would guess 100 feet up or so. i'm not sure. i was really scared and i drove the rest of the way home petrified that they were near me.goofy huh! no one said any thing at work so i guess no one else saw it, or they dont dare to say anything. i hope i have told you everything.                            k;44.8509000000001;-74.2927
These smaller looking aircrafts lined up in perfect formation like a trail of ants starting flying.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-17 20:00:00;3 minutes;Enjoying the bright stars tonight and these smaller looking aircrafts lined up in perfect formation like a trail of ants starting flying overhead in a straight line. They were smaller compared to the regular, daily overhead aircraft. They just kept coming and coming...never saw anything like it.;44.8509000000001;-74.2927
