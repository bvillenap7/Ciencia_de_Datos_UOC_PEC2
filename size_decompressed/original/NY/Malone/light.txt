An erratic light being chased by a jet, then two floating objects quite some distance away,;2002-10-21 18:00:00;15 Min;An erratic light being chased by a jet, then two floating objects quite some distance away, At work, a co-worker pointed out a strange light very far off in the distance.  A plane was in the vicinity, and was leaving a smoke trail.  The Object flashed, and the plane made a dramatic S turn and began to chase the object.  The object disappeared, then reappeard a good distance to the right of the location it was first seen.  The jet continued to trail.  The light vanished again, only to reappear behind the plane, then vanish and reappear again quite a ways in front of the plane and it's second to last location.  The light climbed into the atmosphere and the jet continued to trail, with both shortly leaving sight.  I went back outside at fifteen minutes later and noticed two small objects in the vicinity of the starting point of our initial sighting.  They seemed to hover a small distance away from each other, and slowly floated upwords.  The first one climbed to high to be visible.  At that time the lower one stopped, seemed to float back down at a 180 degree direction, the headed back towards where the first one disappeared. I began a group called the Northern New York Paranormal Research Society.  I have been investigating many occurences like this, and this was the oddest I have seen.  I have not been able to contact any Air Force bases, or Fort Drum, which is in the direction that we witnessed the objects.;44.8509000000001;-74.2927
