green fireball in upstate new york;2004-02-22 20:04:00;10seconds;green fireball in upstate new york Object seen falling earthward,angle of entry approximately 45 degrees to the horizon. The appearance was that of a meteorite falling to earth. It was observed in the eastern sky for a period of approximately 8 to 10 seconds before disappearing below the horizon.  The object had a roughly circular core that was green in color,with a short cometlike tail that was orange. There was no noise detectable as object was observed through a picture window. I am a 50 year old plumber that works for Cornell University.  My wife and I are amateur astronomers and periodically make night observations of stars and planets with our small telescope.  I do not believe that this was a routine  astronomical event.;42.3611;-76.5945
