I witnessed light orange lights out of the corner of my eye. When I turned to look I noticed there were 4 to 6 circular lights. All equally spaced, as if you were to look at the bottom of a six pack or something. This all happened very quickly and lasted 10-20 seconds at the most. As I was looking at them the lights seemed to flash or pulse I guess because the lights never went out, they just brightened up and back down very quickly. They went right down the line, the two front ones (north lights) then to the next set and then to the last (south side). After the last two brightened, all of them disappeared into on single light that took off to the north, very, very quickly. Looked like a shooting star, but much much faster. I mean, real fast. Within a minute of this, I heard jets or other familiar sounds of aircraft in the area. Not right after I witnessed this, but within the minute. There is a military base nearby and I have witnessed many planes in the sky, but I could not explain this ad had to tell someone. I have always been sort of open minded about ufo's and such, but have never witnessed anything of the sort. The fact that I have never seen anything has made me question the idea that they even exist. But like I said, I really cannot explain this at all. I was inside and thought maybe it was a reflection on my window from a neighbor or anything and I could not explain it.;43.9095;-75.3542
