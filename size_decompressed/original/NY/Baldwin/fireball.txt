Glowing fireball goes over my house;2019-09-23 21:24:00;less than minute;Glowing fireball goes over my house On September 23rd at 21:24 I went in the backyard to smoke a cigarette.  As I sat in a chair, in my peripheral vision I saw an unusual glow coming from southwest over my house.  It was like a ball of fire that resembled the sun.  It moved and a constant speed northeast directly over my yard.  At one point it zigzagged a bit and seemed to deform a bit but then continued in its original path.  I scrambled to grab my phone and was able to get two quick pictures of it.  Later I realized I should have taken a video.  Pictures are on my phone though.;40.6586;-73.6026000000001
