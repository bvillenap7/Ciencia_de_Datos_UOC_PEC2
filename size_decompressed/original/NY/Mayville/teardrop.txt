A tear shape object dancing in the air.;2007-12-01 15:00:00;85 seconds;A tear shape object dancing in the air. I was walking to work and I dropped my wallet. I picked it up and I saw in the corner of my eye a red, blue and green blinking lights. I thought that it was Christmas lights but look at it and a tear-shaped object was in the air doing a figure 8 type of thing and this was going on for some time. Then a bright purplish streak though the air and then it was gone.;42.2423;-79.4913
