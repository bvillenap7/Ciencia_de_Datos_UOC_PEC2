Bright, Orange Oval-Shaped Object, Moving Northeast in Upstate New York;2009-07-09 22:15:00;North-east;Bright, Orange Oval-Shaped Object, Moving Northeast in Upstate New York At 10PM, I was using my telescope to look at a bright star. I was about to go inside when, I noticed a bright orange oval shaped object moving a little faster than most planes, across the sky. I was able to follow the object with my telescope. With a focal length of 1000mm, the object was still orange, oval-like and shimmering. This lasted about 3 - 4 minutes. There were no flashing lights or a trail behind the object.;43.3238000000001;-73.6772000000001
