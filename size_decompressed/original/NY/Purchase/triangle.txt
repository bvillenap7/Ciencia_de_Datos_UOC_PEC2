The Westchester Triangle 96?;1996-04-01 23:00:00;30 minutes;The Westchester Triangle 96? At college, just next door to the Westchester Airport, we saw a massive triangle lazily floating across the night sky.  It had 8 small lights on the leading edges, bright white, which blinked a bit.  It had to be several hundred feet in span and it's speed could not have exceeded 50 mph.  We called the airport which said it had nothing on it's radar and had no visual from the tower.  We didn't believe them because we could see the top of the tower from where we were and the UFO was in direct line of sight.  The next day in the Westchester Gannet Newspaper we found out the about 300 people had reported seeing the same object.  Authorities said it was a bunch of ultralights flying in formation at night.  But considering the very low altitude (aprox. 200 ft above ground) we would have heard so many engines.  And the formation didn't vary at all, making us believe it couldn't have been more than one craft.;41.0349;-73.7216
