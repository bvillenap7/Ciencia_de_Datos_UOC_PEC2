I saw what appeared to be a shooting star or a meteorite. I realized that it was flying much too low to be a shooting star or meteorite. It was a bright blue, almost white light. It shot across the sky, then suddenly dissappeared. This was near Westchester County Airport, so I called them to see if any testing was going on, and they said no. I then asked if anyone called about anything strange in the sky, and they said a few people called about it. This was just too strange for me not to write to someone.;41.0349;-73.7216
