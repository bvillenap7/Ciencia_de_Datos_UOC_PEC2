The lights were orange-amber and extremely large in size. They shouted out for me to see it.  There was no noise and the sky was clear.  The lights just disappeared.  We stood on the deck watching the sky and I saw about 3 lights form the direction that we last saw the previous light, shoot across the sky at extremely high speed.  It was amazing how fast it shot across the sky. We have a picture.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.6866;-73.5124
