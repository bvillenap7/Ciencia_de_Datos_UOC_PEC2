ufo recon on long island?;2007-08-16 22:13:00;one hour;ufo recon on long island? We were sitting outside when a greenish blue object appeared crossing the sky then a stream of fire blasted for a second from the rear of the object. It flew across the sky then went down somewhere near sunrise highway. I feel it must of went down near Jones Beach. Then a bright light appear in a circle shape that was hovering in the same area where the greenish blue object fell. We followed the light to a open field and stood there watching what it was going to do. The circle shape started to rotate and around it, other lights in circular patterns appeared. A small circle came off of it and shot away fast. Two other small circular objects appeared near the big one, it stayed there for one hour, then vanished. During the whole event, the sky was different the whole time.;40.6866;-73.5124
