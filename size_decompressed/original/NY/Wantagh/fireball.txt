Four orange lights;2011-12-25 23:00:00;1 minute;Four orange lights There were 2 orange fireballs, passing from the south, heading northeast.  As they passed directly overhead, two more came from behind the trees, traveling at the same speed, about a half mile behind the first two.  I took pictures with my camera phone but they didn't come out very bright.  The lights didn't lose intensity, but did appear to flicker slightly, like fire.;40.6866;-73.5124
