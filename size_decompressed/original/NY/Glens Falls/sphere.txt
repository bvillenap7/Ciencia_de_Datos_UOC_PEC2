loss of satellite radio reception,  black dot viewed in sky for 3-5 minutes.;2005-05-28 17:55:00;3-5 minutes;loss of satellite radio reception,  black dot viewed in sky for 3-5 minutes. On a back deck of a home listening to Sirius Satelite Radio when signal started to break up for no apparent reason.  This is unusual for the radio system when there is nothing blocking the recievers path.   Suddenly there was no signal/sound.   when i checked around i jocking stated to family that the satelite must have exploded which prompted me to look into the sky.   To my suprise i had noticed a black dot (craft) in the sky.  The object never moved.   On this day there was some passing clouds at different altitudes.  Clouds would pass over the object and it would remain in view.  A series of clouds passed below the object and visual was lost.  Moments later the radio began to regaine the signal of the satelite.   When the clouds passed the object was gone. One witness was able to retrieve binoculars and make a visual.  All that could be established was that the object was reflecting the sunlight. other notes satelite radio was lost for a duration of about10-15 minutes visual of craft was about 3-5 minutes.
