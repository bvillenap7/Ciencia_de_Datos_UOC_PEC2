Triangular object glens falls;2020-09-13 13:40:00;10-15 minutes;Triangular object glens falls Outside of a local convenience store I saw 5 people just looking up in the sky. I looked up and saw a dark grey triangular object with what appeared to be a hole in the middle. It was pretty high up and yet it was very large. My estimate would be 20,000 feet but I'm no expert and yet when I put my hand up to cover some of the sunlight it was about the size of my thumb. It made no sound and slowly rotated to the west before shooting off.;43.3114999999999;-73.6448000000003
Triangular object glens falls;2021-05-01 16:35:00;10-15 minutes;Triangular object glens falls Walking on the bike trail with my wife when she pointed out 3 triangular objects following each other in a line. They were grey in color and had 3 lights on the back and the bottom. I estimate that they were at 9 to 10 thousand feet and very very large. I'm thinking it's military but my wife insists on me making this report.;43.3114999999999;-73.6448000000003
Triangular object over the Hudson River;2021-05-19 17:25:00;20 minutes;Triangular object over the Hudson River Walking my dog with my wife near the Hudson River we saw a triangular shaped gray craft. It appeared to suck water up into it for about five minutes then sat about 15 to 25 feet above the ground for 15 minutes. It appeared to be about the size of a single seater plane. My dog was shaking and whining the whole time and that's what made me believe that perhaps this was something strange. I asked my wife if she had her phone and she did take pictures. She hasn't sent them to me yet but when she does I'm loading them onto my computer and sending them to you.;43.3114999999999;-73.6448000000003
