Erratic lights seen, which exchanged position and flashed out and on again.;2016-02-18 22:00:00;20 minutes;Erratic lights seen which exchanged position and flashed out and on again. At 10pm last night, 2/18/16, I observed two points of light jumping around a small portion of the sky.  A red light at 2:00 o'clock and a white light at 8 o'clock if we use the clock face illustration.  When I first focused my binoculars on them they immediately exchanged positions -the red went to the 8 o'clock position and the white to the 2:00 position.  Then they began do jump back and forth like for 30 to 45 seconds.  I could not tell if the moved between the intervening spaces or if they disappeared and re-appeared.  It was happening too fast to adjust my eyesight.  At one point the white light seemed to the circle the clock face.  I had to look away after 45 sec or so because it was straining my eyes.  I couldn't track one light without it becoming the other, but they seemed to return those same clock positions, and pause for a second or two.  This was the ultimate in watching erratic lights in the sky.  I don't know what the point of this activity would be, other than to attract attention and show off.  I looked away again and looked back and the red light seemed to be lower in the sky, and the white light was higher, as if the clock face moved 15 degrees higher in the sky.  I went back and forth to the window for about twenty minutes and the 2 lights were still there, but dancing more slowly at the end.  I stopped watching before they disappeared.  Up to last night I had only witnessed white lights like this--the color red was new to my skywatching.  I had the feeling I would see something in the sky last night when at around 6pm,  I looked outside and saw it was a clear sky.  I've had that feeling before, and saw lights those times, too.;43.3114999999999;-73.6448000000003
