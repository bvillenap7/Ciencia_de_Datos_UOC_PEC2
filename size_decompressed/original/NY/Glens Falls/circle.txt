Circle of light with triangular ray  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 19:52:00;40 seconds;Circle of light with triangular ray Near high school, we were driving and I spoted up in the sky a circle of bright light with almost a triangular ray of light coming down from it. The cirle faded within about 10 seconds of seeing it, then the ray of light faded within another 15 seconds. It took me about 30 seconds after that to pull in my driveway, we got out and looked for a good 5 minutes to see if there was a spotlight anywhere, but nothing. and a spotlights rays would have been opposite from the rays we saw coming from this circle.

Bright white light does flyby.;2014-09-01 20:00:00;5 seconds;Bright white light does flyby. While skywatching at 8 pm I saw a bright white light traverse the sky from horizon to horizon.  It travelled extremely fast at about 400 to 500 ft above the ground.  The duration of the sighting was about 5 seconds.   The light seemed to have a slight arc downward as it passed about two houses south of my home.  It ocurred so  quickly that I was unable to do anything but stare as it whizzed by, silently.   There was no discernible structure, and it didn't blink, or flash.  It just vanished to the east going below the tree line.;43.3114999999999;-73.6448000000003
