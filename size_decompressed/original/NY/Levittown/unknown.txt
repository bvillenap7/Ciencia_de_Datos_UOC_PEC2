Bright lights in a single row. Flying over Long Island, New York.;2012-01-03 01:00:00;10 Seconds;Bright lights in a single row. Flying over Long Island, New York. It was 3 Really Bright lights all in a single line and went by quick.  I saw it while looking out my bedroom window and it was flying towards me.  The path it was taking would have made it fly right over my roof and It was Definitely lower than an airplane and made no noise.  I jumped up and Ran out my front door which Probably only took me 10-15 second at most to do.  I looked in all directions but couldn't see it again.   All I could see was about 3 planes way off in the distance and not the way I saw this object flying.  I would have posted this sooner if I knew of this website.  I just found out tonight when my friend saw the post and said she saw the pretty much the same thing On New Years Night But she says  The one her and her Boyfriend saw was Two Bright lights in a row. No blinking lights and No wings.  It also stopped and made a sharp turn  She says she also reported this to our news station and to here and told me to do the same. If there has been any ! other sighting around where I live I would love to hear about them.;40.7279;-73.5118000000002
Three sets of lights seen over nassau county New York.;2014-01-24 22:05:00;<20 seconds;Three sets of lights seen over nassau county New York At 22:05 Eastern time on the night of Friday, January 24th, 2014, I observed three (3) sets of three (3) red lights in the sky approximately one (1) to one and a half (1.5) miles East of my home.  Each individual red light was approximately twice the size of a usual star in the sky. Each set of three (3) lights was in a triangular configuration, one (1) light centered above (2) other lights.  Each set of lights was approximately twenty (20) to thirty (30) yards away from the next, and situated linearly from each other as if on the rim of a disc-shaped object, or down the side of a cylindrical or cigar-shaped object.  I could not actually see the shape of the object itself, I am approximating it's shape from the positions of the sets of lights.  My house faces North, and I was in my back yard facing East when I noticed the lights.  The object slowly moved in a North-by-Northeast direction, for less that twenty (20) seconds before it was blocked from my view by trees and houses.  My best estimate is that from the objects position when I first noticed it. It was approximately one (1) to one and a half (1.5) miles East of me, and approximately eight (8) to ten (10) inches above estimated horizon. True horizon could not be calculated due to fences/houses/etc. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD));40.7279;-73.5118000000002
