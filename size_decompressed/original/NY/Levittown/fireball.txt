((HOAX??))  This was one of the most wonderful, light, fire, glowing flame experience.;2014-02-23 21:00:00;seconds;This was one of the most wonderful, light, fire, glowing flame experience. Laying down on my back looking at stars, while wind blowing and hearing sound of wind. Started praying to Jesus and marveling at his wonders, and at the same time praying for a better, tomorrow.  I notice what I could only describe this light in the sky. As I'm praying and looking out the windows clouds were.clearing,  Quickly. I saw what seems  to be about 500/600'  up in the sky beautiful,brilliant light smoothly passing by my window.   I text my son then my daughter and told her it could have been an angel. I dont know what it is but it was wonderful. ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot certify that this is a serious report.  PD));40.7279;-73.5118000000002
5 fireball/orange shapes sitting in the sky for two minutes before disappearing.;2014-06-28 23:00:00;3 minutes;5 fireball/orange shapes sitting in the sky for two minutes before disappearing. Was sitting on my deck when myself and 3 others noticed 5 circular orange lights moving very slowing in the sky.  The objects were at different heights.  They looked to just sit in the same spot for awhile and we tried to take video footage with our cellphone.  We got a few seconds on film before they just disappeared.;40.7279;-73.5118000000002

Unknown object appeared to be flying at a very high altitude too high to observe shape.   It was glowing red/orange.  We thought that it may be a plane on fire.   Only one object observed.  Flew by very quickly headed south. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.7279;-73.5118000000002
