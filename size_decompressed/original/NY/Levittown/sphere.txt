Witnessed 75+ orange disc shaped lights traveling in a straight line on 7/4/12 heading east on Long Island, NY;2012-07-04 22:30:00;10 minutes;Witnessed 75+ orange disc shaped lights traveling in a straight line on 7/4/12 heading east on Long Island, NY Saw over 75 disc shaped orange lights in a straight line traveling east on 7/4/12 at 10:30. There was no sound,and we could tell that it was not a small plane, helicopter, firework or chinese lantern. They were traveling one, two or three in a row, following each other.  They seemed to be moving slowly but then there were a few trailing behind who were quickly trying to catch up with the others.  I witnessed this in my car with my husband and two children ages 14 and 10. I turned around the block as they traveled east and saw them ascending up into the sky and slowly disappearing.;40.7279;-73.5118000000002
14 orange sphere shaped objects seen in the sky traveling northeast on Long Island on July 4th during fireworks.;2013-07-04 22:40:00;30 minutes;14 orange sphere shaped objects seen in the sky traveling northeast on Long Island on July 4th during fireworks. On July 4th, during fireworks in the neighborhood, approximately 13-14 deep orange spheres were seen in the sky following each other traveling northeast on Long Island, NY at 10:40 pm. I was in my car with my 2 daughters ages 15 and 11 when I saw an orange object traveling at a fast speed over us. It originally appeared triangular in shape but as it moved higher up in the sky it became sphere shaped. A few others were following it so I drove my car in the same direction.  They started flying higher up into the sky and eventually disappeared. I got out of my car and videotaped 3 more traveling in a straight line.  After those disappeared, there were about 6 others following in the same direction at different times in a 20 minute period. Please note that this was the second year in a row that I had witnessed UFO's in my neighborhood on July 4th.;40.7279;-73.5118000000002
White orb flying low overhead.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-29 19:00:00;2 seconds;White orb flying low overhead. I was walking with my daughter when a white orb--about the size of a soccer ball--rapidly flew overhead in a shallow descent and disappeared.   The incident lasted approximately 2 seconds, only one was seen, had a bluish tail, and disappeared suddenly.  It was maybe two stories high, which seems unlikely for a meteor.

definitionless / valueless gray circle (not sphere) moving across the sky;2019-07-27 23:30:00;<1 minute;definitionless / valueless gray circle (not sphere) moving across the sky I was sitting outside against the tire of my car waiting for a pizza delivery, just sitting there looking at Jupiter/Ceres whilst I notice a circle (Not sphere) moving slowy at low altitude (Seemed to me at the time being).  It was honestly seemed like just a balloon at first and moved at the same rate.  But what was absurd about it was it really had no definition/value it just seemed to be a 'flat' round point in the sky,  It was about a size of making a circle with your thumb and index and holding it at arms length.  It was a warm gray color and lost sight of it after a minute going behind the tree line   Characteristics of Object*  There were aircraft but as I live on long island this is very common.;40.7279;-73.5118000000002
