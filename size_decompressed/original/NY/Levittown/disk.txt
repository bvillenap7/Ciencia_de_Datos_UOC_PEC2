1970 - Saucer shaped object with lights hovering over house in NY.;1970-07-20 21:15:00;3 minutes;1970 - Saucer shaped object with lights hovering over house in NY. I'm not sure of the exact date - sometime between 1969 - 1972.  I remember there had been talk of alot of sightings above the Meadowbrook Pkwy. on L.I. NY.  It was a little after 9p.m.  I was around 17 yrs. old, coming home from my p/t job.  I pulled up in my drive way, got out of my car and noticed a saucer shaped object with a row of lights just hovering above my house.  I looked at it for what seemed about 3 minutes - I got scared but no one was home to call to come outside and see what I saw. Quick as a flash it took off and was out of sight.  The next day I went to work & told my co-workers what I had seen, supposedly alot of other people had seen it.  The explanation we heard was that it was a weather balloon. (I don't think so).  Has any one else seen that? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.7279;-73.5118000000002
