These green objects would come up from below the horizion from due south and come up to a higher position to the south east and preform unnatural moves in the sky.   As the first oject would move off to the north another object would appear in its place coming up from the horizion in the south.  The objects that would head to the north would get more distant and higher in the sky almost as if they were gradually moving away.  As for the acrobatical movea they would preform, when one object woul move they would all do the same action.  These objects as they made a line from the south to north they seemed to all be gradually moving away.  This went on for what in my recolection was about an hour and five minutes, and the most unbelievable part was when it ended the last oblect on the end of the line moved at an alarming rate and almost seemed that the last flew through the others and picked them up.  This object took off into the darkness at an angle that did not make it seem that it was haning around.  These things did not make noise and did not seem to be man made.

Cylinder shape object in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of the International Space Station.  PD));2006-09-07 20:00:00;40 sec;cylinder shape object in the sky i was heading over to my car parked near a school and i look to the sky and i saw what at first apeared to be just a bright light much like a star.i realised that it was very odd to be a star because it was so bright and so close to the horizen.when i focused on it i realised it was more of a cylinder shape that a orb.it was completely silent and still for about 30 seconds when it shot away at incredible speeds. at this point it moved across my plain of sight but was still visable. it then slowly fadeing away as if it was vanishing in thin air. it was one of the most amazing sight i have ever seen, me and my friend who witnessed were shaken for a good 30 min. afterwards.i tried to contact you via telephone but was unable to get through. ((BEGIN CORRESPONDENCE WITH SOURCE OF REPORT)) Dear Mr. ((name deleted)),  Thank you for the report.   I suspect that you were witness to an overflight of the International Space Station.  The details of its overflights over Levittown, NY, can be seen below:  04 Sep -0.8 20:16:35 10 WNW 20:19:30 75 SW  20:21:25 19 SE 05 Sep 1.3 20:40:10 10 W  20:42:31 22 SW  20:43:56 16 S 07 Sep 1.5 19:51:18 10 W  19:53:40 22 SW  19:56:00 10 S   The link is here: http://www.heavens-above.com/passsummary.asp?lat=40.726&lng=-73.515&alt=27&loc=Levittown&TZ=EST&satid=25544&Date=38958.6666666667&Mag=  I suspect that you were facing the southwest, as you watched the object, and that it passed from your right to left.  Objects orbiting the Earth appear to race off, and disappear over the course of a few seconds, when they fly into the Earth's shadow.   Thank you, again, for sharing the information with our Center!

5 Red and yellow lights in a circle over Long Island.;2018-08-14 20:25:00;2 minutes (plus);5 Red and yellow lights in a circle over Long Island. On 8/14/2018, at approx. 8:25 pm, I was walking my dog around a park in a populated suburban town on Long Island. It was a clear night.  There was a crescent moon.  Both Mars and Venus were visible, and I was very aware of their placement in the night sky.  In fact, this is why I was looking up.   I observed a red light, which I first thought to be a plane, but noticed it was moving in a zig zag pattern, and it got my attention.  There was a plane either following it or flying with it.   It was north of me, flying east to west.  The light stopped and hovered.  One light became 3, and then 5 or 6.  This was instantaneous.  They formed a circle.  Each was bright red with a yellow bottom which appeared like a light.  They stayed in the circle, and the plane seemed to fly through the middle of them.  The event lasted around 2 minutes, but it could have been less.  Two of the lights disintegrated and disappeared, then another, then the remaining 2.  There was nothing left!  Right before and during this, I kept losing my phone call to my friend. I was repeatedly trying to Facetime her so she could see it.  I did manage to Facetime her long enough for her to see 2 of them. I tried to use my camera, but I was having trouble using that as well.  It seemed to be frozen.  I should mention, that I’m not one who uses the camera all the time, so this might have been because I’m not adept at it. The event seemed to have concluded (whatever it was), and I started walking home.  Around 10 minutes later, to the East, a solid red light appeared in the sky.  This did not have the same yellow bottom.  Like the others, it dissipated, but this happened more quickly.  I observed one or 2 more of the same in the next few minutes.  I stopped seeing any lights around 8:45pm. I felt elated and excited by the whole experience.;40.7279;-73.5118000000002
