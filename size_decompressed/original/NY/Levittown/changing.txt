2 orange spheres that faded away and lasted for about 15 seconds each.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-05 02:00:00;30 seconds;2 orange spheres that faded away and lasted for about 15 seconds each. There was 2 spheres orange/ red very small circles that would fade away.  I didn’t get the chance to take a picture or video because I became freighted and terrified.  Although it was beautiful to see another life form come to earth whatever it was, it definitely did scare me.  I know for a fact it was not an airplane or meteor because they would fade away quick.  One appeared as I walking from from the gym at 1:59 am, and the other at 2:01 am, for about 15 seconds each.  I could’ sleep after but the worst part is that before I saw those two circles.
