At a party, 8 witnesses saw a bright craft.  It was almost similar in shape to a Star Trek craft, it was so low to the ground and moved so erratically, it was hard not to notice. it flew around the perimter of the surrounding blocks, and then disapeared.  Bright blue and white lights that hurt the eyes to look at beamed off the craft.  When it dissapred there were at least a dozen planes and helicopters circling the area.  After about 15 minutes, the sky had weird, cloud looking formations and several witnesses clamied they felt dizzyness.  After the primary planes that appeared were gone, 2 black hawks flew over where we witnessed the sighting, and then dissapered.   Then, the area became extremley windy, and then the strange happening ceased. ((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain as to whether this was submitted as a serious-minded report, or not.
