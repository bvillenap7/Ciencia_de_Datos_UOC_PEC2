Both were gone Within 30 minutes The First Light i seen was when i went outside to get something. i noticed a Bright Orange/white Light in the Sky. It came out of nowhere and stayed Still. It got brighter then it was gone. So i went in the house and watched outside of the window. Where the Star was there was a Small Triangler Shapped star there that changed Rapid Colors. I kept Watching It until My Friend Screemed and Said look over there. It was 3 orange lights that Came Out of NO Where and were Very Bright.  they looked like this  0 0 0   So I looked at them through some Biniculars And It looked Like it was a Craft Spinning. It was gone a minute Later. Then I kept Watch On The other Star Thing For awhile. It looked like it changed shap into a Line and Then It Was gone. This is not the first Time i have Seens those lights up here before, But not 3 orange lights at once. I have seen the lights at least 3 other times in the Sky but they were like the first one. It was just one light they didnt move. it got bright and then was gone.  This is my report. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  PD));44.2303;-74.4907
