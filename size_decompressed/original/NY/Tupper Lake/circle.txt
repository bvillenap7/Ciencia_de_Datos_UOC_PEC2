Formation of Military jet aircraft in area of larger round reflective object;2007-12-01 09:30:00;30 seconds;Formation of Military jet aircraft in area of larger round reflective object At approximately 09:30 I walked out on my back deck to have a cigarette. I head loud jet aircraft noise and it was odd to me as there is not much jet aircraft noise as it is a fairly remote area of Upstate New York.  I looked up into the sky and toward the west I noticed the contrails of three aircraft in a formation and could identify that they were military aircraft probably Airforce Fighters. the sound was rather loud and figures they were accelerating possibly using afterburners.  To the south of the aircraft I noticed a round shaped rather larger object. The three aircraft were making a turn to the west. The round object seemed to be reflecting the sunlight coming out of the east. The larger round shaped craft then dissapeared from sight.   I grew up in Southern California near Edwards Air Force Base and was familiar with the sound of military aircraft and fighter jets.  My father worked for NASA at Dryden Flight Research Center. There is not much aircraft noise is this area and thought it odd that there was a group of Fighters in the area.   The larger round object seemed to fade as it turned slightly and dissapear from sight.  Jet aircraft contrails were still visible for a short time and were curved as the aircraft were making a high G force turn.  The Profile of the Jets seemed to disapear but the jet sound reduced in intensity possibly to moving away from the area, changing course or reducing throttle.   The whole incident probably lasted 1 1/2 minutes. The weather was clear with no Clouds cold probably in the upper 20's with no wind.;44.2303;-74.4907
