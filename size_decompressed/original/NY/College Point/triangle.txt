Very Bright, was not moving so fast, then I lost track of it. Hi just wanted to let you know that I saw a triangle shaped ufo from my window in College Point, NY.  I was researching and found similar footage on youtube and our your site to what i had seen.  It had bright lights on each of the corners of the triangle and in the middle i belive, it was very bright, was not moving so fast but I lost track of it due to other buildings around me and waited for it to show again but I didn't see it anymore.  it was moving north west in the opposite direction of the Laguardia Airport.
