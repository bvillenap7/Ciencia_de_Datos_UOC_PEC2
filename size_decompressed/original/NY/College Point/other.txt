Completely silent commuter plane at 2,000 feet.;2016-03-06 10:30:00;2-3 minutes;Completely silent commuter plane at 2,000ft. Walking back from 7-11, I witnessed what appeared to be a commuter plane that looked out of place, due to its flight path, altitude and the fact that it was making no sound at all. I see planes every day coming and going from LaGaurdia airport, which is just across the Flushing Bay, about a mile and a half away.  This plane was at about 2,000 ft. traveling East by South East.  Planes arriving and departing are always much lower, anywhere from 500 to 100 ft at this distance from the airport.  When planes fly over from other nearby airports they are usually higher, about 5,000ft.  Even then they can be clearly heard.   The plane in question seemed to be gliding rather than flying, produced no contrails, and was completely silent. I have lived near J.F.K. and LaGuardia all my life and have never observed a plane that close that made no sound.  Quite strange.;40.7855;-73.8466
