On the flatbed was a craft that resembled a somewhat flattened bullet, with the back end flatter and 3 or 4 round things inside the back end for possible propulsion or exhaust function.  no windows. no wings.  object was as long and wide as the flatbed, which are usually 48 feet by 6 feet. it was tied down with ropes and rope netting.  it was silver with army camo painted on it.  i've never seen anything like it, and find no images like it anywhere on the internet.  since I was traveling I only saw it briefly.
