Triange shape,no noise,huge,pink lights.;1978-08-15 21:00:00;10seconds;Triange shape,no noise,huge,pink lights. I saw this U.F.O. twice within months of each other. The first time, I saw three seperate lights forming a triangle,one light at each point. I said It's going to land! What I meant by that, I have no idea. I just blurted it out. As soon as I saw it, it was gone. The three lights were florescent pink. YES,florescent PINK. The person I was with saw nothing, heard nothing< and felt it was huge. The next time,it was around 9:30 p.m., same as before. The same person was with me only this time he saw it!!He said he thought I was crazy but now he sees what I described before.Same color, only this time it was pointed up, one light at the top and two lights underneath, forming a triangle. THIS time there were two more pink lights under the two bottom lights,with pink smoke coming out of them, almost like it was landing! It seemed to be landing down by the Lake Champlain Ferry Landing and radio station. We drove to the place we thought it was and as soon as I got close to the Lake, all the hair stood up on the back of my neck, with an awful feeling I should mind my own business. I drove away as fast as I could and as soon as I got away from that spot, the uneasy feeling went away. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.8485;-73.4470000000001
