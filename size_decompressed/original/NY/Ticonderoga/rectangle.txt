No noise at all.;2016-10-05 22:20:00;7 minutes;I was walking home from work (and its a long walk) and every once in a while I would look up at the stars, when at one point I looked up I saw these 3 white lights that seemed a little odd.   When it got closer, and I mean maybe a half a mile over my head, it was rectangular, a flat bottom and I didn't see the lights on the back until it was almost over me.   Don't believe in extraterrestrials or anything like that but I do believe that the government has machines out there that we don't know about but the kicker here is there was no noise at all.  If I wasn't looking up, it would have gone over me undetected. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.8485;-73.4470000000001
