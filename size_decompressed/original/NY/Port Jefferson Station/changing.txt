THIS INCIDENT was one town over in the Homegoods/DOllar Tree shopping center and it happened on the EXACT date 2 hours apart from my first report. (Not sure if I reported it here but to Muffon also) We were alking tom y car and I looked up at 6:00PM EST and there were similar lights spinning and dancing in the sky. When I came home and replayed the video there is actually one of them that cam eout of formation and was in the parking lot. It was moving almost at the speed of light so couldnt see it with naked eye with y camera but when I pause the video and zoom in the light in the parking lot dancing in front of us only feet away because it was actually in FRONT of the Dollar Treet sign and then takes off of the screen. Then....comes back and as I am pausing the video it is moving and dancing just like the few in the sky but it is RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME and it was fol! lowing my path almost like it was playing with my as I walked toward my car and toward the sky where they were flying away. THe movements were TOO QUICK TO SEE WITH THE NAKED EYE. I was only seeing the ones in the sky when I was filming it. FUrther, in person we were saying OMG they are like an orangey yellow and on my video they are ONLY WHITE. In person, they were orangey yellow in the sky. Looked like little fire streaks. Twisting and dancing in the sky.;40.916;-73.0497
