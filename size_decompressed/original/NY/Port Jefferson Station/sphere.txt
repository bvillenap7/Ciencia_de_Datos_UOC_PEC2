I stopped dead in my tracks and watched as this object move across the tree line and disappeared into the distance heading North east at low altitude. I thought to my self that this object looked so low as if it was going to crash in the distance. I stood there for about three or four minutes just couldn't believe what I just saw. I waited to see If I could here any noise but there was nothing, just a small noise from the distant chopper I had seen earlier.;40.916;-73.0497
