Conversely, most animals seem to exhibit an apparent fear of UFO's, and usually seem to seek shelter in their proximity.)) It was about 7:30pm and I was observing the fishermen and planes land  at a nearby airport. It was about 7:30pm and I was observing the fishermen and planes land at a nearby airport. I  then saw what appeared to be a star. I stared at it for 7 seconds and then a plane flew by. I looke at the plane and then when  I turned to look back at the star it  was gone. Two guys then caught two 27pound blue fish.;40.9153531645569;-73.7868575949367
A Round Bright Light the Size of a Beachball flied right over my brother and I heads before dissappearing;2000-05-15 20:00:00;5 seconds;A Round Bright Light the Size of a Beachball flied right over my brother and I heads before dissappearing My brother and I was walking on Pelham Road around 8:00pm on a clear night along side the A&P Shopping Center in New Rochelle when we both saw this bright light flying over the A&P Shopping Center and right over our heads.  We must of had at least 4-5 seconds of analyzing this round light the size of a beachball flying right over our heads and then disappearing as we continue to look at the direction it was flying which was across the street from the A&P.  It vanished right before our eyes as if they knew we had visioned their identity.  The object made no noise.  But my brother and I was just stunned about what we had saw and realizing that it just disappeared in front of our eyes.  I went to nearest pay phone and called the New Rochelle Police to report this sighting just in case.  The New Rochelle Police Dept. did not even want to believe me.;40.9153531645569;-73.7868575949367
I viewed 3 orange circles in the southeastern sky.  They stayed still for a few seconds, and then streaked off.;2017-11-26 19:30:00;30 seconds;I viewed 3 orange circles in the south eastern sky.  They stayed still for a few seconds, and then streaked off. Very high in the south eastern sky - very far above where airplanes fly - an airplane happened to fly by at the same time - 3 orange glowing rings, not much larger than stars, but large enough for me to see them and determine that they were circular in shape, were seen by me just as I glanced up at the sky.  They were in a straight line I could not tell if they were touching each other or not.  Nevertheless, they were in very close proximity to each other.  The line was straight but at about 30 degrees.   After several seconds had passed, they took off in 3 streaks of orange moving upwards at a 45 degree angle and then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be quite serious-minded.  We suspect that she is an excellent, and reliable, witness.  PD));40.9153531645569;-73.7868575949367
It was definitely above the scattered clouds that night and strange as it may seem to say I had the feeling it knew I was looking at it;2021-05-27 20:45:00;approx 2 mins;It was definitely above the scattered clouds that night and strange as it may seem to say I had the feeling it knew I was looking at it Went outside for a short walk which I usually do around the same time each night, looked up and at about 1 O'clock position in the night sky clear as can be was an lit object with bright blinking lites that went from clear bright white to a ruby red color (but mostly white). I was able to use my phone to video it but the video does not do it justice in it's appearance, it was much clearer seeing it live. The thing that impressed me most was it's ability to be so still in the sky like it was just pinned up there in the sky pretty amazing. And when it did move it did so in that typical UFO zig zag motion. I called some news agencies but none of them took it serious enough I suppose but I also posted the video using my brothers youtube account. I used his account for a few reasons but the main one was because earlier that day (God's honest truth) I had visited his grave sight he passed in 2017. Not sure what that has to do with the sighting but that's how it ha! ppened. here's the link to the video...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e1zjLnry1k&t=41s;40.9153531645569;-73.7868575949367
