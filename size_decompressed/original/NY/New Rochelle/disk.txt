On this particular evening it was a dark cloudy, light rain overcast.  I was coming out of my building where I lived on 1 Beaufort Place in New Rochelle, NY a couple of years ago (10/04)walking toward my car when I seen a very bright light beaming from a dark cloud.  There were multiple clusters of dark clouds with gaps in between.  Well I was looking very hard at this one particular dark cloud for at least 30 secnds with this extremely bright light coming from the center.  Then all of a sudden I seen a disc like object shoot upward through the gaps of clouds in a diagonal motion into the evening sky.  I guess this object realized that I saw there light beaming from the dark cloud and took off.  They must of been watching me while I was walking as I began to realize there existence before they took off. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
