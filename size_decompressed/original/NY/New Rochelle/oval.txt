Close encounters of the real kind (space craft) for at least one minute about 100 yards right over my head;1974-08-10 13:00:00;1 minute;Close encounters of the real kind (space craft) for at least one minute about 100 yards right over my head I was 11 years old on this one particular bright day in the afternoon in the summer of 1974 when I was standing outside my two story duplex house when a cast of dark shadow cover me and the whole house.   When I looked up there was this huge aircraft flying right over my house traveling less than 5 miles an hour.   I fell to the ground frightened by the size and how low it was traveling.  At this particular age I was not sure what to think this really was.  This aircraft made no noise whats so ever.  It just came up behind me out of no where.   I would say that this aircraft with its technology probably took pictures of me hundred times before I noticed its existence.   The other side of my block is about 100 ft. across approximately which at the speed of this aircraft was traveling, they had observed my presence for at least 30 seconds or more before I identified them.  There are houses on the other side of my block.   When I fell to the ground I was looking at this aircraft slowly flying right over my two story house with cavities and lights underneath its craft and dark greyish in color.  Iam not exactly sure the total shape of this aircraft because it was so low hovering right over my head.   When it passed my house I could not believe what just happen.   I ran up my house and told my parents but there could not understand or comprehend my story. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

UFOs are REAL!  45 SECONDS OVER MY HEAD IN A STILL POSITION - and then IT ZOOMED AWAY.;1978-07-01 22:00:00;45 seconds;UFOs are REAL!  45 SECONDS OVER MY HEAD IN A STILL POSITION - and then IT ZOOMED AWAY. About 1977-1978, I was in my early 20's - I never thought to make a sighting report.  About 1985 I realized I my psychic abilities was getting stronger and realized that maybe this sighting was a sign to me.  About 10 p.m. in the evening my friends and I were in a hotel parking lot going to a club when we looked up in the sky and noticed with about 10 other people something zooming or shooting from very far in the sky to right over our heads - like when a plane is ready to land and you feel it is going right over your head.  This oval shaped silver aluminum looking UFO, was as it the oval was on its side with a very bright white light surrounding the whole equipment.  My concern was that I did not have my camera.  It stood over our heads for about 45 seconds with no sound - and then it zoomed extremely fast into the same spot in the sky it came from.  It did not fly - it zoomed.  A plane takes time to fly and does not stop with no noise. I believe in UFOs since that day.  I have an MBA and am an intelligent individual.  I know I am not alone - I just wish I had a camera - I could have been famous. Also, last week I saw a very large meteorite which was silver white and royal blue.  It looked like fireworks but it did not breakup until it disappeared right before it was going to hit the beach area. Till my next sighting... ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
