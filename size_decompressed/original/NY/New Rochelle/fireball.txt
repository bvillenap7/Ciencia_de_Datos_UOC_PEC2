Bright Orange lights in the Sky above New Rochelle NY;2012-08-04 21:35:00;more then 20 minutes;Bright Orange lights in the Sky above New Rochelle NY well, I was just leaving my aunts house with my mom.  I usually look up at the sky because I love to see the stars.  Then I looked up to my left and saw 3 bright orange color lights in the sky not to very far, probably close to the High School.   My mom and I were wondering what were they.  They weren't making any noise. and stayed in one spot for a wile in a triangle formation.  My mom thought they were  Planes but I know planes don't stay in one spot in the sky.   Then each one started to fade like lights dimming down. after they disappeared they re-appeared farther away and in more numbers, to what I counted up to at least 8 of them.  They all shined bright orange and all together in the same area together, kind of in random positions and moved around slowly and smoothly. they all started to disappear after 1 minute or 2 fading away and left only one.   Then it disappeared and appeared as 3 farther away, they formed a triangle again.  It just kept repeating the disappear and re-appear act but this time just with 3.  It was going in the direction of Northwest I believe. the last that I saw them was just 2 staying in the sky next to each other probably  50-70 feet away from each other, I'm really unsure.  I really can't tell how high in the sky they were,  probably a few hundreds of feet off the floor.  The sky was dark mostly clear but few clouds.  The moon was very beautiful,big and bright orange/yellow oval shaped, my little cousin described it as an egg.;40.9153531645569;-73.7868575949367
