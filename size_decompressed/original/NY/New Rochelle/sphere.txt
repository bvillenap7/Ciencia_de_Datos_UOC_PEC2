Red light sphere moving in vertical and horizontal directions in Westchester County, NY;2017-12-01 17:00:00;5 minutes;Red light sphere moving in vertical and horizontal directions in Westchester County, NY My wife and I were looking at the large full moon as we stepped outside our home around twilight.  To the left of the moon, I saw a stationary red light in the sky.  It reminded me of the red lights one may see on top of a tall antenna.   I thought it may be a plane, but it did not move for an extended period.  That's when I brought it to the attention of my wife.   Shortly thereafter, the light dropped down in a rapid vertical descent.  It remained visible.  It paused a little and then rose vertically.  The light also moved horizontally once or twice.  Overall, it would move, remain still, and then move again.   Lost sight of it after about five minutes as I tried unsucessfully to find the source of the light by driving toward the light.  Since this occurred in a city, I was never able to find the light.;40.9153531645569;-73.7868575949367
