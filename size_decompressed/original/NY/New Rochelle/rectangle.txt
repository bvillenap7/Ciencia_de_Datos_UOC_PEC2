It was a long rectagular shape with rounded corners, had 2 lights on the longer sides across from each other and 1 light in the middle of the shorter side. It was moving very very slowly, and not too high in the sky. It traveled over my building and after about 6 minutes I didn't hear it nor see it any longer. A friend of mine in Flushing, Queens, NY said he had heard the hum as well about 30 min before me, but it was too cloudy for him to see anything.;40.9153531645569;-73.7868575949367
