(taxi driver and passenger) I was driving my taxi on a very clear night around 4:00am in the morning in February of 2001.  Had a passenger in the front seat.  The passenger was a bouncer at a night club in New Rochelle.  I was driving down Palmer Ave in New Rochelle where the passenger lives and before the passenger got out of the cab a space craft flew right over the cab at tremdous speeds that we were both able to observe this sighting for at least 3-4 seconds before disappearing.  It was like a starwars space craft flying through our atmosphere at Hyperspeed motion.  I was able to see thrust coming out the back for a split second.  We looked at eachother and the passenger thought it was fireworks.  I said no it was a flying UFO we just witness together.;40.9153531645569;-73.7868575949367
Slow moving star light;2009-09-18 19:31:00;45 seconds;Slow moving star light Every since I reported an incident several years ago I have always kept my eyes open upon going fishing at a specific location. It happened again. I was fishing at Glen Island with friends.  I walked to go get my pole. I noticed an unusual clear visibility of the stars. I was looking South East, past Long Island and straight up towards the Sagittarius constellation when I noticed a dim star, start to slowly move. There were no noise or blinking lights. The dim moving star was as close to the other stars and I knew it was too far away to be a plane or satellite. I yelled to the other fishermen and pointed up and asked them if they saw what I was seeing. They saw it after I pointed toward the direction. The dim moving star-light passed between two stars and kept moving in a straight line for about 10 seconds and then vanished. Iâ€™m an astronomer and have scene satellites and rocket launches. This was no satellite. I was amazed and shocked that I witness the same similar thing that I had saw and reported several years ago on this forum.;40.9153531645569;-73.7868575949367
