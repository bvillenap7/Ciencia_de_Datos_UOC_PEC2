Blue illuminated round object;1998-06-01 20:00:00;few seconds;Blue illuminated round object I am the second witness writing in to confirm my brother's statement that we saw a blue light fly overhead on Pelham Rd., in New Rochcelle, NY some years ago. My brother Noel and I were walking down Pelham Road right next to an A&P Supermarket when suddenly visible flying overhead was a bright blue round shaped object very blue a bright blue round shape, silent in sound, fast moving and disappeared either behind trees, homes or it just took off fast and that was the end of it. For me personally, I couldn't explain what it was, I never saw anything like it before or since.  so, I guess I would have to call it an unidentifiable flying object. Yes, I would.

extremely bright light that moved very slowly and disappeared in the opposite direction.;2007-11-04 04:25:00;5mins;extremely bright light that moved very slowly and disappeared in the opposite direction. There was a bright light, noticeably brighter than any of the stars out there that night, and it moved extremely slowly towards me. At first I thought it was a plane but the light was only white, and it barely moved, but it DID move. It looked like there were multiple white lights, as it was spinning or something. Then it suddenly became very distant and eventually disappeared in the opposite direction.;40.9153531645569;-73.7868575949367
