Bright light in sky moving back and forth and then disapeared;2008-08-16 05:45:00;5-10 Minutes;Bright light in sky moving back and forth and then disapeared I was driving home from work and noticed a very bright light in the sky.  There were no stars visible and the sky was a blue color at the time. As I was nearing the object it seemed to be moving to my left then back to the right and then to the left again. When I got close to the object you could almost make out a shape to it but not certain on the exact shape.  When I was about to pass under the light it suddenly just disappeared, and I could not spot it again in the sky.  I was driving in a westerly direction on State Route 38.  On a side note I saw a very similar object in the sky a month or two ago but it was further away that time and again disappeared suddenly.;42.2302;-76.1579
