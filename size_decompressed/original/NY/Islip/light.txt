a white tiny light moving thru the sky;2008-10-12 05:20:00;35 sec;a white tiny light moving thru the sky was 520am, i went outside and was looking up at the stars for about 5 sec, when i start to see this white dim light moving through the sky. it looked like it was beyond the stars cause it was so high up and almost impossible to see but i kept my eyes focused on this tiny light. i followed it to try to see what it was.it seemed to zigzag some so then i knew it wasn't a plane, besides there was no red flashing lights, just a dim white light moving thru the stars. i watched it for as long as i could see it.;40.7325528301887;-73.2183396226416
Red Orange Objects Flying V Formation In Sky Above Long Island New York.;2012-12-18 23:45:00;10 seconds;Red Orange Objects Flying V Formation In Sky Above Long Island New York On December 18th, 2012 in Islip NY I was standing outside a friends home waiting for a ride back to my house.  Often at my house, since there is a clear view of the sky, I look up and hope to see a shooting star.  On clear nights I often do.    So standing outside my friends home I decide to do the same.  I'm looking south and up to Orion's Belt.  I tilted my head back a little to see above me and I see many objects whizzing around.  The objects are red-orange in color and about twice the size of a star but only a fraction of the brightness.   As bright as something on the edge of a street lights view.  The objects flew like insects fly with sharp and fast darting movements.  The objects were moving quickly and as they were moving around they also all started moving south in direction and within two seconds had formed a large V shape consisting of about 7 red orange objects and a line of 3 following on the left side.  There were no streaks as shooting stars.  There was no sound.   The formation of red orange lights continued what seemed now seemed slowly but smoothly on a southern course gaining height and flying towards Orion's Belt.  I did not look away, I reached for my phone to record video not looking away at all, but it did not load until the objects were out of view.  My friend showed up the literal second they disappeared.  I was still staring up in the sky and I yelled for him to come and look.  By that time the objects in the sky were gone.  What I saw tonight on Long Island...a place I grew up on, I have never seen the like of in the sky.   I am a religious person. I work in the music and food industry, I fish and do things we all do. I know what I saw.   I will never forget those 10 seconds of my life.  It is now one of my biggest memories.  It is unsettling to me, however I am a person of truth and I would like to know what exactly the red-orange luminescent bodies flying in the sky in formation above our heads are.  Thank you for your time.;40.7325528301887;-73.2183396226416

At first I thought it was a plane until I noticed its flight characteristics.  It stopped in mid air and shot to the left at a high speed and came to a complete stand still.  After watching it drift upwards it shot downwards and made a sharp right turn and came to a complete stop again.  Realizing this was a ufo I ran in the house with my dog to get my phone to record it.  When returning outside it was completely gone.I have been looking in that direction every night since them and nothing!  N ow when I take the dog out I bring my phone..;40.7325528301887;-73.2183396226416
