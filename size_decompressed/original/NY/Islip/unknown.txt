Burnt orange in color, cruising at a low altitude with absolutely no noise.  Then the second, then 2 together, then the 5th and then the 6th at about 10:30 p.m.   Shortly after each passed us, the light flickered as if it was going through a cloud, and then went out completely - but there are no clouds in the sky this evening, and the stars are clearly visible.  Each of the 6 did this.   We looked at the last one through binoculars, and the orange lights seemed to be in a honeycomb hexagonal pattern.   One military jet flew from east to west and veered south between the 4th and 5th sighting.   My friend took a video with her phone.;40.7325528301887;-73.2183396226416
