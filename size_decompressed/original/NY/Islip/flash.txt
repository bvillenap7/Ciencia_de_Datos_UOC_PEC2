Flash of Light Shape, UFO?;2007-11-26 17:18:00;few minutes;Flash of Light Shape, UFO? Here's the story:   I was looking out my window and suddenly in the sky there was this finger-shaped light-blob, pink with a few colors mixed in.  It was clear-cut and definitely looked like it was in the sky.  Before I blinked the thing vanished, which was very peculiar.   I grabbed my camera, shooting pics but I didn't notice until I downloaded them that I caught something.  The object looks nothing like what I saw, but I have a theory: I saw the real thing in some kind of transaction (so I could see it), and my camera saw the energy field around it.
