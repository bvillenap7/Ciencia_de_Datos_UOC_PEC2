Around 9 pm looking Northeast from our deck on Mt. View Lake, we saw 5 to 6 red round globes of red light come over the trees--then disappear as more can up--around 30 or so in all.   All disappeared in the same space as more came up--about 30 or so in all.  No noise--no smell?  Do not think it was fireworks??;44.7319;-74.1372
