Then i focused my eyes and got a better look it was slowly moving and then stopped.   I then ran inside got my wife it was a bright glowing orange color.   After about a minute it was hovering over top of the house and the orange glow was gone.  You could clearly see a disk and from the distance away it was about the size of a childs soccor ball.   It stayed there for about a minute then headed slowly in the sky towards watkins glen.   At that time we went got my brother at his house and tried to find it again but did not.;42.3445;-76.8372
