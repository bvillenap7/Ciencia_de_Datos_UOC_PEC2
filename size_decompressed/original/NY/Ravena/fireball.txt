3 fireballs no sound flying low in formation.;2013-11-01 21:00:00;~1 minutes;3 fireballs no sound flying low in formation 11-01-13 9:30 pm was coming home with my wife and kids. Noticed three bright red ornge objects that appeared to be about 3000 ft above the ground flying in a triangle formation.  They seemed to be moving at the same speed in formation, about as fast as a helicopter.  They flew in a straight line over ore heads.at first I thought maybe jets or helicopters but they made no sound at all.  Then thought they might be something coming thru the atmosphere but ther were no tails or heat signature at the end of them.when they reached half way across the sky they broke formation.  They all changed speed and one appered to speed up almost as to catch up with the one leading formation.   I have never seen something in the sky I couldnâ€™t debunk but these I am losing sleep over.  Have not seen them since but im looking.;42.4754;-73.8220000000001
