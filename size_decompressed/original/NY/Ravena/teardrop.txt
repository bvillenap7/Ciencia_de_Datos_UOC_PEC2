Teardrop shaped lights over Ravena NY;2007-09-12 05:30:00;30 minutes;Teardrop shaped lights over Ravena NY Went out to get my morning paper, looked up at sky and noticed a teardrop shaper form of very bright white lights, some blinking, some still. There was no sound at all. The object was not visible, only the lights. The object did not move. It stayed completely still in the sky. I called my wife out. She saw it also. We watched it for about 30 minutes, until the sun came up. The object started to fade away with the sun's light. I expected to see a craft of some sort that the lights were attached to, but there was no craft, just lights.;42.4754;-73.8220000000001
