Triangular bank of bright, unmoving white blinking lights seen over Ravena, NY.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus in the E sky.  PD));2007-09-12 05:30:00;30 minutes;Triangular bank of bright, unmoving white blinking lights seen over Ravena NY. Roughly triangular bank of white lights, some blinking, some steady, noticed in sky above Ravena, NY this AM. The man who first noticed the lights had stepped outside to get his morning paper. He claims he has no idea why, but for some reason he looked almost straight up from his front steps, and saw the lights. His wife came out as his request and also observed them. Object did not move at all for the entire sighting. No sound was heard. Clouds could be seen moving behind the lights as the Earth rotated. Man took several photos of the lights. As the sun became brighter, the couple expected to see a craft, but only saw lights. It appeared as though the lights were not attached to anything. As the sun rose, the lights became harder to see, and finally faded away entirely. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Rather large brilliantly bright stationary object, bigger than a helicopter hovering to the East of I-87;2016-03-13 21:30:00;5 minutes;Rather large brilliantly bright stationary object, bigger than a helicopter hovering to the East of I-87 We were driving south on I-87 and were almost entering Greene County but were still in Albany County.  We saw a bright light to the East most likely close to the Hudson River.  It was stationary and not completely symmetrical.   As we approached it going south it did not move or flash.  We went past it and almost under it.   A few miles up the road we entered the New Baltimore Service area, got out of the car and looked to the north.  There was no sign of it.;42.4754;-73.8220000000001
