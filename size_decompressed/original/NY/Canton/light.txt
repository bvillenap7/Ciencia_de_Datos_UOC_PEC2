Two unblinking lights travel in line across the sky in Canton, NY;1980-02-17 19:10:00;20 seconds;Two unblinking lights travel in line across the sky in Canton, NY I took the dog out and was watching the sky.  I saw two bright white lights in the sky.  The sky was clear and stars clearly visible as well as the moon.  The lights were slightly larger and brighter than surrounding stars.   They were not blinking so were not an airplane.   Also, they could not have been satellites because they were spaced very far apart (holding hand fully outstretched two points of light about 2 inches apart) and most importantly their movements were in sync with each other as one followed the first in a direct path/trajectory and speed (as if two lights on front and back of very long object).  They were traveling SW I believe and were very bright when I first noticed them.  They continued downward toward the horizon and became dimmer as they did so.  This was slow enough for me to consider what I was watching, then run inside and have my wife come out to see just before they disappeared.  Unfortunately she could not find them in the sky/didn’t know! what she was looking for.  I could not make out an object linking the lights but highly doubt that they were meteors or any conventional aircraft.  I could not tell the distance but was very confused, as they seemed almost as stars moving slowly across the sky.  They travelled very close to Orion’s belt and in a similar line.  They were the distance between the lights was also comparable to the length on the three stars which make up Orion’s belt. On a separate occasion about 2 ¼ yrs. ago, I saw three enormous (full moon) sized orange lights in the night sky driving down rt.11 @7:00PM.  The sky was overcast and there was a full moon behind the clouds. These lights were in front of the clouds and in a perfect line above the horizon toward the south. I was shocked when I saw them and watched them blink out one at a time. The event lasted about 15 seconds. The lights were the same color as a streetlight and had the same type of glow around them.  Appeared as bright and large as a street light from a distance of 75-100 feet.   I travel this stretch of road between canton and Potsdam everyday and there are no buildings or anything to explain where I saw them.  I have also found many other reports of orange lights in the area, which is a large reason that I wanted to report this sighting.  I don't want to give away too much about my identity so I will just say that I am a faculty member at one of the local universities.;44.5919;-75.1619999999999
Three, blue, circular lights were hovering in a triangle formation over a field in Northern, NY in June 1991.;1991-06-01 23:30:00;3 minutes;Three, blue, circular lights were hovering in a triangle formation over a field in Northern, NY in June 1991. My husband and I were driving late at night (between 11pm-midnight) on Rt.68 between Ogdensburg, NY and Canton, NY in June 1991.  I looked out the window where I was sitting on the passenger side and saw three, blue, circular lights hovering over a field.  They were off in a distance of about 1500ft., were in a triangle formation at first and then started moving in a fast, jerky motion.  I shouted to my husband to look quick.  These lights separated and spread out still hovering above the field as we kept driving.  My husband slowed the car and we both watched these objects for another minute.   Not sure what I was seeing I asked my husband, who was in the National Guard at the time, if the military had new flares they might be testing.  He told me absolutely not to his knowledge.  The lights remained hovering for a few more seconds and then each round light shot up into the sky at different angles and disappeared.  Both of us still remember this UFO sighting very vividly and we even found out later on that other people saw these lights that same night as well.

White-ish moving lights/dots;2019-09-01 23:21:00;1.61;white-ish moving lights/dots It was September 1st 2019. I had been  away all day, where I was is roughly 2 to 2.5 hours from my home. I was traveling back home on a dark country road around 11:15-11:25.  I stopped to take a pee on the side of the road I was nearly home about 30 minutes left.  Did i mention nobody else around.  As I was hiding on the back side of my vehicle I noticed to my right lightning or so I thought.  Wrong!  So I said to myself get your phone stupid.  I got my phone and for approx 2 minutes or more watched and recorded.  There was what  appeared to be two lights or big dots that where bright white-ish in color on top of each other slowly moving swaying side to side.  There may have been a slight up and down motion as well and if moved the right way another light/dot seemed to appear making it  almost like a triangle pattern.  Let me tell you it was interesting, I wasnt scared but I wasn't waiting around to see what happened either!;44.5919;-75.1619999999999
