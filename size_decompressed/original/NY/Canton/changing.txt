((HOAX??)) Large object dispersed two smaller objects.  ((anonymous report));2016-06-18 22:00:00;45 minutes;Large object dispersed two smaller objects. Just before 10pm, 06/18/2016, in the southern sky of northern NY, I saw a moon almost full.  To the lower left of the moon, I saw what appeared to be a blinking satellite.  To the right of the moon, and slightly lower, I saw what appeared at first to be a bright planet, or a giant bright star, much bigger than surrounding stars.  It began moving to the right faster than the satellite was traveling.  The skies were very clear with minimal thin clouds.  There was a tail to the left of the brightest light and it grew in size rapidly.  It continued to move and grow without a tail visible then it began to reduce in size and stop.   At 10:41, two bright flying objects came from the central bright light.  One flew to the left and the other to the right.  They were traveling fast.  The one on the right increased in size quite quickly and appeared to have at least three separate lights in a triangular shape.  Both flying objects continued until we could no longer see them.  The main light stayed stationary until we stopped watching and fell asleep.;44.5919;-75.1619999999999
