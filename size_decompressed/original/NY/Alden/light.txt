The object was going up at a fast rate and when it went behind the clouds you could see the clouds! The object looked flat from a distance and it had no flashing lights on it to tell me that it was a airplane or heliocopter. It had two bright lights that were side by side with a small space in between. I opened my window and I couldn't hear a sound. I live in the country and there isn't a lot of noise that I hear besides crickets. It startled me a lot. When it reached a point in the sky, it sat there for a couple of minutes, pulsing with its lights. Then it moved very quickly over to the West and sat the for a couple minutes again pulsing. Then it got very bright and then it just disappeared. the object seemed very large and flat from a distance. There were two very bright lights side by side going upwards. no sound, no blinking lights to indicate it was a airplane or heliocopter. when it stopped, it was pulsing. very lightly. When the object was in the West, It got very bright it had a somewhat blue tint to the light when it got bright. and then it just disappeared.....;42.9004999999999;-78.5262000000001
Satelite looking objects moving unintelligibly with shocking ability to change direction and stop.;2015-07-26 03:00:00;2.5-3 hours;Satelite looking objects moving unintelligibly with shocking ability to change direction and stop My brother and I were star gazing on the front porch, with as much light pollution eliminated as possible.  We were looking for shooting stars and satellites.  I have been an armature star gazer and into astronomy for over 15 years.   We noticed what looked like a satellite moving sporadically and seemingly unintelligibly. Its ability to change direction, increase speed, and stop, was unlike I've ever ever experienced in my life.  Clouds became patchy and light which hid the object on us several times yet the object stayed in the general vicinity of the sky.   When the object became unable to see from a small cloud I noticed that there were actuall many such objects in the sky.  They became easy to pick out due to their consistent light yellow tinge they had not a bright white like your average satellite.   At this point we realized this was exceptionaly abnormal and awoke anyone we could in the house and visibility was decreasing due to dawn beginning and cloud cove! r. My sister was visiting and saw them.  My wife (in my experience is not the best at spotting stars/satellites/shooting stars) couldn't pick them out, but in her defense the cloud cover was getting dense and I could only pick out one obvious one to show her which she missed.  Some objects seemed to operate alone yet some seemed to be in a disorganized group of three.   Best part is this happened ten minutes after telling my brother about a satellite I saw way up north that moved from side to side and that I couldn't believe my memory cause I saw it when I was maybe 7 years old and I wish I could see something like that again to validate my experience.   I am a ufo skeptic, I don't necessarily believe in aliens, I think most people who see ufos are nuts, and I always wished I could see something that would change my beliefs.  I don't know if my beliefs are changed but that was the most bizarre and unexplainable thing I've ever seen in the sky in my life.   I stayed up till the sun was up and they became no longer visible.  They left the area tre! nding wi thout a straight course to the west.   There was 10 to 20 of them...due to clouds and the objects activity it was almost impossible to keep track of them all.  Wow;42.9004999999999;-78.5262000000001

Then it split into three and went straight up in the sky.  Within seconds it was gone ((name deleted)) New York;42.9004999999999;-78.5262000000001
