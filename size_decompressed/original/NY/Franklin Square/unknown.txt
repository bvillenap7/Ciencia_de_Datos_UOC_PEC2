Long Conta-trail;2000-07-09 09:15:00;50 sec;Long Conta-trail I was standing outside my work van when I heard 3 explosions in the distance, at first I thought it could have been bombs, but that didnt make no sense. I looked up to the sky and I saw a contra-trail from as far as my eyes could see southwest to the northeast. It was a rather interesting trail... As a footnote of report of the lights over the Levittown area, my friend, his parents and half of his block witnessed the whole event also.;40.7033;-73.6718
