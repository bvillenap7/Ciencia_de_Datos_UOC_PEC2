Bright red circular object over Franklin Square Long Island;2013-07-05 22:40:00;1 minute;Bright red circular object over Franklin Square Long Island I saw a bright red circular object on July 5th 2013 at approximately 10:40 P.M. EST. The object moved from east to west above my house in Franklin Square New York.   I saw the exact same object last night, July 4th at about the same time, but I assumed it was just a Chinese lantern or some form of fireworks since it was the 4th of July.  Now that I saw it again tonight, July 5th, I figured it was worthy of a report. The planes that fly over my house always are going in the same direction and in the same path but this object was moving in a different path.  In less than a minute the object moved from the eastern part of the sky to the west until it was out of sight.   I heard no noise coming from it.  It slowly, gracefully floated across the sky.  It did so in such a way that led me to believe it was not the all too common paper lantern.   The object was not just sitting in one part of the sky but moved just like a plane would completely across the sky.   The red light was not flashing but was constant throughout the objects traverse.;40.7033;-73.6718
