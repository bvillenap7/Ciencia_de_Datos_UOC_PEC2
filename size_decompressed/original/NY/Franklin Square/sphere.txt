Six UFO's in one night, five on video!;2017-07-04 22:00:00;10 minutes;Six UFO's in one night, five on video! On July 4tharound 10 pm my wife and I were cleaning up from guests and watching the neighborhood fireworks experts do their thing, when I saw a reddish ball in the sky looking north.  It put on a showy display of flashing, pulsing lights.  My wife was in the adjacent kitchen and came out to see for herself.  The craft then displayed a white light that went left to right, then repeated, as though the light were encircling the object.  As it was after sundown I could not discern the shape of the craft.  I ran upstairs to get my video camera, my wife kept watching the skies, when I returned and trained my camera the object had decreased in magnitude and was gone before I could capture it. Approximately 15 minutes later, I saw an object, when looking southward.  I was able to get my camera and record the event for two minutes.  The object was glowing red, apparently spherical, it then disappeared briefly, but a flashing white light came from the location it had been.  Another blinking object appeared lower left.  The second object disappeared below the tree line, the first drifted off to the east as it grew fainter. Upon reviewing my footage I became aware of 3 additional objects.  There is a white object that moves quickly across the screen, another that zigzags twice before seeming to split off into two different directions, as two objects.
