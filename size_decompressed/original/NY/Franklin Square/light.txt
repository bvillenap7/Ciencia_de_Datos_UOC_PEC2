Bright yellow object moving horizontally.;2014-07-04 22:00:00;30 minutes;Bright yellow object moving horizontally. During the 4th of July fireworks, we saw a bright yellow object move horizontally across the sky.  Although we couldn't gauge the distance, we got the impression that it moved very quickly -- faster than a commercial jet.  It stayed in the sky far too long to be a firework, and showed no signs of rising or falling, as fireworks normally do.  We saw the object appear, then disappear, three times.  Each time, it was visible for 5-10 minutes.   We couldn't hear any sound from the object, although of course it was difficult to tell with the fireworks going off.  The object did not appear to have any blinking lights of the kind that planes have.   Three of the four witnesses report that the same object has been seen in three previous summers from this same location. On this particular instance, we also saw a translucent bubble shape moving across the sky, near the yellow light.  That shape seemed closer, however, and it may have been associated with the fireworks.;40.7033;-73.6718
