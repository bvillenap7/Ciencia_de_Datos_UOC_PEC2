multiple fireballs in sky over long island;2010-08-21 22:00:00;20 minutes;multiple fireballs in sky over long island at 10pm eastern standard time on august 21 i saw a orange ball of fire. at first i thought it was a plane on fire but it made no sound after about two minutes it seemed to fade out or burn out. then i saw another from the same direction about 500 feet apart. i saw six to ten of them before i called my upstairs neighbor also my mother in law to come see. she came to the window and witnessed one after the other for about 25 minutes. we both couldn't explain what we saw but it weirded both of us out greatly. tried to take video on my phone but wasn't sure why it didn't come out. they all came from the same direction and faded out at approximately the same place.
