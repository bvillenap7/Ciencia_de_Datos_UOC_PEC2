Teardrop-glowing ever so slightly;2001-09-15 00:05:00;30seconds;Teardrop-glowing ever so slightly It was just after midnight and I walked out in to the driveway to smoke.I always look at the stars and just happened to catch this teardrop-triangle type object going across the sky.It had a very ,very dull type glow- it almost wasn't noticable except that I happened to catch its movement out of the corner of my eye.The glow was orange-red-like I said almost not even noticable.It took probably between 15 and 30 seconds to traverse my part of the sky.The object also seemed to have a little wobble effect to it.I would judge that it was about the size of a pool ball and probably no more than a thousand feet up.;43.1105341891894;-79.0361274324332
