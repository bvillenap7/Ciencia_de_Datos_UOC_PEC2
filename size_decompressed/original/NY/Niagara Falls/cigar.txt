Object viewed from observation tower at Niagara Falls, white lights on both ends, cigar shaped with row of lights going down the side.  Very, very large, perhaps 900 feet long, stationary for 20 minutes then disappeared.;43.1105341891894;-79.0361274324332

The back of my house faces approximately south.  Due east and approximately one mile from my home is the Niagara falls airbase and international airport.  So it's not unusual to see a large commercial passenger plane at a low altitude on a landing run over my back yard, heading due east.  In perspective to its height, if I  where to hold my hands up and follow on both ends of the plane it looked to be about two feet long.   As it approached directly over head I noticed another object  approaching from a slight southeast direction, and they appeared to pass one another, the second object to the southern side of the passenger plane, from my perspective they looked to be equal in size, only this new object was a little blurry or hazy, as if it was actually much higher and the haze was a result of the gases in the higher atmosphere which means this t! hing was either much larger than the plane or, if it was gases, magnified by them.  The sound of the landing plane was clearly audible and the sound stayed with the movement of the plane, it was definitely low enough that the sound of it's turbines didn't trail behind it.  But, as this other object passed the plane, I followed it until it passed over the corner of my home on it's north, slightly northwest trajectory.  I observed it was moving a little bit faster than the descending speed of the plane, it had absolutely no wings or protrusions, in made absolutely no sound and it was lined with maybe 4 to 7 lights that appeared to be pulsating very brightly in shades of red and green, but because it appeared to by in a haze, almost like peering through a wave of heat that rises off of black top, any detail other than the lights and outline where not distinguishable. I can only speculate what this was but I have two theories.  One is that it was hazy because of its height and is ! actually enormous or not quite so large and amplified by the magnifyin g properties of gases. Second the blurry affects are from a malfunctioning cloaking apparatus, and the lack of sound or wings or afterburner means it may have been an antigravity vehicle. These are not my pictures or video, but for reference purposes I have included them.  The object in the video looks like it's actually reflecting light, the lights on what I saw where consistent. This is what I saw only more hazy and larger.  The top comment from the Nexus Knight is mine: https://youtu.be/fPi0wi7gRgg    A silent but illuminated cigar shaped craft passed a low altitude commercial passenger plane from opposite direction directly over head.;43.1105341891894;-79.0361274324332
