Distant dot moved witnessed while looking at moon.;2014-05-05 23:04:00;10 seconds;Distant dot moved witnessed while looking at moon. Looked at moon and noticed a very small, very distant dot (like an average star) that, from my angle, was moving left to right on the left-hand side of moon.  Faint clouds covered up the travel path and the object was nowhere to be seen.  Was not blinking like an airplane and would not have vanished after cloud cover.  If it was a star then it would have still been visible after cloud passed.  Moved slower than a shooting star but faster than an airplane. Had to have lasted no longer than 10-30 seconds.;42.8354;-78.7573

Stationary Red Circular object was observed in the eastern sky. After a few minutes it moved horizontally to the left at a high rate of speed then stopped and turned Green.   Object then zig zagged and moved back to the area it was first spotted, turning to a red color.   A few minutes passed and the object turned green and dropped out of sight.   Before the object dropped, we noticed two drone planes flying past us in a northwesterly direction at a low altitude.;42.8354;-78.7573
