We both saw a large round-shaped object that had a bit of a point.;2019-01-10 18:10:00;1 minute;My wife an I were walking our dog at the Old Psych Center on East & West rd at 6:10 pm on the road that runs along the creek.  My wife said OMG and pointed up above us and we both saw a large round shaped object that had a bit of a point and that's why we are calling it tear shaped.  It looked gray in color, silent, guessing about 50 ft above the trees and it was like the size of a baseball diamond.   The object didn't move nor make any noise and after watching it for about a minute it then just disappeared.  Our dog is older and seemed to not even notice it and just went about sniffing the little snow on the ground.  We didn't feel scared at all but after it disappeared I did feel like the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I said let's go home which we did.;42.8354;-78.7573
