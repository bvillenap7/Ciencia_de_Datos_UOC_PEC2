Triangular object, all white lights.;2012-03-20 03:40:00;1 minute;Triangular object, all white lights. The Northeast sky contained a triangular object that had all white lights as opposed to an aircraft which alternates colored lights.  It was not silent.  Hovered low, to our eyes, and eventually moved on.   My husband and I both noticed it. I am out during the early morning hours 365 days a year.  I deliver our local read and see late arrival aircraft on occasion.  This was not one. Only other thought is that we are not far from Niagara Falls Air Base and maybe this was a fight jet.  I have heard fighter jets in the past and this did not sound like one.  Also time of departure would have been an issue.;42.8354;-78.7573
