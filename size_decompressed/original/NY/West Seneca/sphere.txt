Orb light seen flying westward over South Buffalo, NY.;2010-07-17 19:15:00;30 seconds;Orb light seen flying westward over South Buffalo, NY. My mother and I walked my brother and his wife to their car after dinner and I noticed both the half moon and sun were in the evening sky around 7:15 PM.  My sister-in-law was already in the car when I told everyone to look up at the light moving across the sky.  My mother and brother both wear glasses and have poor eye sight but I indicated description and the location of the light in relation to the half moon and light clouds in the sky.  They could not spot it. The light was the size and brightness of an average star you would see in the night sky only it was moving steadily in the blue sky in a westward direction towards Lake Erie.  As I was trying to show my brother where it was it gradually vanished, this could have been from cloud cover but it was clearly visible moving through other clouds near where the Moon was in the sky.  It appears that when I first saw the object, it was flying below the clouds. There was no trail like what you would see from an airplane, the object was high in the sky but appeared to be a white orb or light.  Moving at that speed and distance I would rule out that it was a high flying seagull which would have a different shape and not be as bright.  The weather conditions at the time were clear, no excessive humidity. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
