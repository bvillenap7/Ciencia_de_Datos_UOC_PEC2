South, south west  flight path Two egg shaped objects, moving slowly in perfect sycronization, flying south, then south east. No lights, color dark grey.as they slowly veered south east, they took on the glint from the sun, and shined like metal objects.No sound.I thought it was unusual, to fly so close in perfect sync. together.If I stretch out my arm, they are about 1/4 inch in size, flying just below clouds, then dissapearing in clouds and reappearing again.I saw this  through the window, when I went out in the yard for futher obervation, they were gone.;42.8354;-78.7573
