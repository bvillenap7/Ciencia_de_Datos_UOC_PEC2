Very small, bright objects, about teh same apparent size as Jupiter or Saturn, 3-12 in number, showing no apparent movement;2000-07-23 18:30:00;10-12 min;Very small, bright objects, about teh same apparent size as Jupiter or Saturn, 3-12 in number, showing no apparent movement At about 18:30 I was in my back yard, grilling some syeaks. A small twin-engined commuter aircraft passed overhead, on a generally southerly course, and turning east. I looked up to watch him, and at that time obsereved 3 bright lights bearing approximately 110-115 degrees. The angle of elevation to the horizontal was about 40-50 degrees. I called to my wife & had her come outdoors, and had her bring a pair of binoculars with her.The objects were about the apparnt size of Jupiter or Saturn, when seen in the night sky. The were in an irregular formation, and showed no apparent movement. I cvould not see any detail, either naked eye or with the binoculars, nor could I estimate altitude. The number of objects increased to 12, and the slowly diminished , the last one disappeared about 10-12 min after I noticed the first one. I did not hear any sounds associated with the objects, and they did not show any apparent motion.The sky was clear (there were some cumulus clouds on the far eastern horizon)and the visibility unlimited, with little or no haze. I had a glass of wine at the time and did not have anything to drink prior to this event. Question: Is it possible that these were Bolides?;42.8354;-78.7573
