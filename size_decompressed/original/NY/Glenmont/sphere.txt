spherical object;2008-07-10 17:30:00;15 seconds;I was driving home from work and saw in the clear blue sky, a spherical object that was brightly lit - possibly reflecting sunlight. I only noticed it because of the light either coming from it, or reflecting off it. It remained still for about 15 seconds and then suddenly disappeared. It left no trail - it just vanished.;42.5971;-73.7959
