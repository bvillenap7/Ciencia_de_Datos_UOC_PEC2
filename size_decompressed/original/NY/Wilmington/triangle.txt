Mystery lights flew over my home and car within 60 feet of the ground.;1992-08-05 23:00:00;10 seconds;Mystery lights flew over my home and car within 60 feet of the ground. It was around 1100 pm in summer..  I had left my parents home to drive to my home, which is about 1000 feet down the road.  As i approached my driveway I saw above me three or so different colored lights that passed over my home..over the road and my car.I quickly pulled in driveway, shut car off as fast as I could and jumped out to look.  Gone and not a sound..definitely was not a plane or military objects. I am very familiar with those.  I have only mentioned to a few people and have spent years looking for answers.  I am glad I am not alone on this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
