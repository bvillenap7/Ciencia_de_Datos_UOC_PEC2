My friend was showing me how to set my phone so I could take pictures of the stars and they will show up on my phone. While we were doing this. We noticed a object flying over us from east going west  there was no sound and then all of a sudden it went straight up it looks like a diamond shaped and it was so bright no strobing lights no sound it didn't even stop just went straight up gradually. My other friend that was there who is a credible Witness. He turns to and says why are we freaking out about what we just saw.;42.5802;-78.2632

My friend was trying to show me how to take pictures of the stars with a certain setting on my phone cuz I couldn't figure it out. While we were looking up at the stars trying to take a picture. We seen this very bright object. To me it look like a diamond flying across the sky from east to west. Then all of a sudden it started going straight up in the sky until it faded away and you couldn't see it anymore. It was crazy how bright the object was and no sound. No one said anything to each other we just continued on. Until one of my friends who is a credible Witness (police officer) said why isn't anybody freaking out about what we just seen. I tried to downplay it cuz I watch those shows all the time but this is my second sighting in two different locations;42.5802;-78.2632
