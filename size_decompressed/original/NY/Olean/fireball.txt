Green fire ball appearing to fall at very high velocity;1999-01-15 22:30:00;1 sec;Green fire ball appearing to fall at very high velocity I was driving to work,on highway 17, just west of olean, ny, and observed a green fire ball moving very fast and straight, appearing to be headed straight for the ground.  I do not believe it could have been a shooting star, it was to big and very green, as the color of burning copper.  There was an earlier event of the same, only was heading north, northwest.  The date of this one is unknown.  Once again, only a second to view.  Co-worker also seen the this event, although I do not feel he would talk about it with any one else.;42.0804000000003;-78.4233999999997
