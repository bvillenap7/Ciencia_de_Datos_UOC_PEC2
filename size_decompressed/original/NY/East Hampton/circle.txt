Huge spotlight hovering, disappearing cloud/smoke.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 21:30:00;1 min;Huge spotlight hovering, disappearing cloud/smoke At the ocean beach in Amagansett NY.  3 people.  The object was spotted by one person and brought to attention.  The object was the biggest light in the sky I have ever seen (distance was hard to tell but seemed very close).  The object did not move in any direction or make any sound and was shinning down in a triangle shape.  There was no other light just one big light shinning down.  As I told my friend to take a picture the light went out.  All that remained was an illuminated cloud/smoke in the shape of the triangle that faded and began to dissipate.   As we continued to stare curiously and talk (2-3 minutes after the light went out) 6-8 planes that seemed to me very high and only noticeable by there wing lights seemed to comb the sky.  What we saw WAS a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 19:40 hrs.  Time above may be wrong.  PD));40.9893000000001;-72.1787999999999
Strange light in the sky;2010-07-10 23:50:00;20-30 sec;strange light in the sky i was driving back from east hampton to nyc, when ahead of me a very shining star got my attention, for  a sec i thought i was looking at the north star, since it was very bright and kinda stood alone in the north direction, but then i observed a change in the light intensity of the object, it got brighter a bit, i realized i was not looking at a star , but at a strange light. i got scared so i pulled over, not leaving the light outta my sight at all. it made a very strange move, then suddenly the light dimmed away, just like it reacted to my constant starring,. dissappeared. it wasnt a plane or an helicopter, as there were no clouds or fog, very clear sky  for their lights to disappear. plus the light was steady still, so the plane or helicopter is outta the question. it wa sa shooting star, cus the light didnt shoot away in a straight line, but zig zaged very little some left, then to the right.......
