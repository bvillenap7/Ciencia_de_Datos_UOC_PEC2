I was awake in my bathroom, when the room filled up with orange light as i a truck with bright orange lights were backing into my driveway.  When I looked out the window I noticed the light was coming from the sky, approx. 45 degree angle from the North horizon.  The light was orange, bright and confined to a small area in the sky- a few seconds later is was gone.  My bathroom was bright enough from the light that you would be able to read a book.
