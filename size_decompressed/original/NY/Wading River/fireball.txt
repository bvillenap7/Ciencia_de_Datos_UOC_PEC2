I saw an orange/red ball of fire go across the night sky from east to west directly over my house.  It was much larger than any shooting star or meteor that I had ever seen.  There was no tail and no noise whatsoever.  It appeared to be somewhat low in the sky the moon was out and visible, but it was cloudy and no stars could be seen.  This object was far below the cloud cover.  I half expected it to crash off to the west or hit the tree tops.  I ran to follow it as it moved, but my view was obscured by trees, and I lost sight of it.  There were no blinking lights and no real specific shape to it.  Any suggestions?;40.9567;-72.8328
