I left my house at 9:20 P.M. going from Middle Island to Wading River (NY). The towns are about a 10 minute drive apart.  So I'm driving down route 25 at 9:20 P.M. and as soon as I got on the main road I noticed a big bright light in the sky.  It stood out because it was a pitch black sky with no stars.  So as I'm driving I kept my eye on it because it was unusual.  It didn't move so I thought maybe it was a star.  The closer I got to it I realized it wasn't a star because it had colored lights.  But it wasn't a plane because it just hovered in the sky.  I opened my car window and it was silent(not a helicopter)It didn't move at all, it was completely still. When I had a perfect view I pulled my car over to see it.  Another car pulled over to(I don't know if they were looking at it also?) I realized a police car was on the side of the road too. The police drew my attention for a few seconds, I looked back up at the sky in all directions and it was gone. There is no way any plane could disapppear out of sight completely within a few seconds. The best way I could describe the object was a sphere shape, VERY bright and with blue and red lights on either side.;40.9567;-72.8328
