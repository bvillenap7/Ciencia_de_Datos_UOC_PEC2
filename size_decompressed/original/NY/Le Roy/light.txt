It had finished snowing for the evening so there were no stars in the sky. I saw it outside my window and called for someone else in the house to witness it as well as someone on video call. The two of us watched for a few minutes until it changed. The light started moving left to right rapidly. Then it stopped back in the same position I found it. Then, the light eventually and stunningly SUDDENLY went dim. Almost as if a car had turned off its high beams. The light went from bright to dim several times in one minute. Then the bright white light stayed dim and slowly started moving to the right and as it moved, it got dimmer and seemingly red in color. For maybe 30 seconds until it absolutely faded away as it was heading north in the right direction. And when it disappeared, I got the impression the must-be townâ€™s light beneath it became! lighter as if it had given light back to it.;42.9762;-77.9888000000001
