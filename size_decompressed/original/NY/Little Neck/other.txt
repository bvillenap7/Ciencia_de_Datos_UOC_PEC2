numerous UFO sighting;2010-04-14 22:00:00;all night;numerous UFO sighting Hello, I wanted to report some very weird objects which I have been watching now for the past few weeks.   I love watching the night time sky and while looking up in the heavens i noticed which at first looked like stars.  After watching what looked  these stars as i will call them, they were moving in a very strange pattern.  Some will look like they are skipping across the heavens.  One minute I was looking at the Object in one spot next in the blink of an eye the appeared in another.   At first when I just started noticing the objects about One month ago, I only would see maybe one.  Then a few nights later I would see two or three.  Last night I saw dozens of flying objects while sitting in my yard.  My wife would only look at one object which was the brightest of the bunch,  She agreed that it was moving. My wife is a non believer and told me that it probably was a plane, she also said i was crazy (I'm not). My son who also sat outside with me for about  fifteen m! inutes saw a UFO that blew him away.  He also has a hard time believing.  If you or someone could come to investigate this, you would be blown away.;40.757;-73.7283
