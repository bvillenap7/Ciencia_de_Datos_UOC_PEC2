My friend and I were riding our bikes around town at night.  We were stopped at a grassy area when we noticed a yellow light in the sky.  The yellow light was stationary at first, then it rapidly shot all the way across the sky, much faster than an airplane or satellite.  At location the yellow light shot to, we noticed a green light, again not moving.  Shortly after, like the yellow light, it rapidly shot across the sky out of sight.;42.62;-73.8343
Multiple white orbs of light traveling across the night sky during Perseid meteor shower;2015-08-13 03:30:00;1 hour;Multiple white orbs of light traveling across the night sky during Perseid meteor shower Multiple white orbs of light seen traveling silently across the sky while watching the Perseid meteor shower over an hour period.  All but one moved quickly across the sky at airplane speeds (W-E).  Two crossed paths (N-S and W-E), nearly colliding into each other.   The last orb displayed erratic behavior.  It traveled slowly (N-S), stopping occasionally.  When it stopped, it appeared to turn or wobble for a few seconds.   None of them flew in a straight line.  They had a bit of a zigzag flight path, as if the operator were unsteady behind the wheel.  There were also planes in the sky, so there was a clear distinction between the white orbs and the planes, which emitted an alternating red and white blinking light and traveled in a straight line.;42.62;-73.8343
