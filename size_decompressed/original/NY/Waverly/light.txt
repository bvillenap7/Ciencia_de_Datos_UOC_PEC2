Bright light in the sky that illuminated the clouds.  ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter??  PD));2008-08-07 22:15:00;45 Minutes;Bright light in the sky that illuminated the clouds. It was a rainy night, and a light that illuminated the clouds caught my attention. The light was oval in shape and appeared to illuminate the clouds in what could be best described as a rotating spotlight. When the light appeared away from us it would light up clouds in a circumference 15-20 time the size of the light in the center. The light then rotated slowly towards us and it was very bright, bright enough to cast very small shadows in the field from the trees. When facing us it appeared to veer left to right at minimal distances, but at very high speed. The light held my attention and never did disappear completely, nor did it do anything stranger than that of which I have described.;42.0078;-76.5252
