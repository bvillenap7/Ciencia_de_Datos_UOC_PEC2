It was a very bright light that at first looked like a comet, coming directly toward me. But as I watched it get brighter for a very short period of time, maybe 4 seconds it then got dimmer, and traveled in a southerly direction and got so dim that it eventually disappeared. However, the odd thing is, there was another that followed and did the exact same thing after this one disappeared, coming out of what I would say was the exact same location, following the exact same path the first one did, and faded in the same location.;42.9366;-75.8352
