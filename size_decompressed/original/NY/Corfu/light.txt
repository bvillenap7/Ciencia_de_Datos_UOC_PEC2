NOT IN OUR ATMOSPHERE!!! 90-DEGREE TURNS!! FLASHING WITH INCREASED SPEED!!;2005-08-05 00:37:00;3 minutes;NOT IN OUR ATMOSPHERE!!! 90-DEGREE TURNS!! FLASHING WITH INCREASED SPEED!! It was the beginning of August, late at night, maybe a little past midnight. Two of my friends and myself were down the road from my house, lying in a field, looking at the stars.  A little solid white light caught my eye, so I pointed it out to my friends.  Both of them acknowledged it and were just as amazed as me.  They at first thought it was a plane, but I pointed out there were NO flashing lights or red lights. On top of that we all agreed that this thing was NOT in our atmosphere. They then decided it was a satellite, but were proven wrong when it made a 90-degree turn east. After its turn it shot stage right really fast and made another 90-degree turn north. It is hard to tell how far it traveled but from my perspective about four inches across the sky. After its second turn it came to a sudden stop, and started to flash slowly. The flashing lasted about 7 or 8 seconds and increased in speed until it shot outwards away from earth leaving a white trail behind it that slowly dissipated.  It was gone.
