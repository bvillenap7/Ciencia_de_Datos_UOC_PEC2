Yellow/Orange sphere that changed to blue sphere as it passed witnessed in Western NY by 2 campers;2013-07-26 22:30:00;1-2 minutes;Yellow / Orange sphere that changed to blue sphere as it passed witnessed in Western NY by 2 campers Object appeared from the east horizon line, the object first looked like a Chineese candle balloon / lantern that was bright yellow/orange in color, then as it got closer it just looked like a big illuminated ball.  It travelled laterally at a moderate pace towards the west at what looked to be 5000 to 10000 feet ( hard to guage not knowing what the object was or its actual size).  Once the object had past our centreline on the horizon (north) a large blue sphere surrounded the object dissipating the original yellow colour into a much smaller spec within the blue sphere,  Once the object reached the west horizon, it appeared to gain altitude as it quickly assimilated with the stars and disappeared.;42.9791;-78.3956
