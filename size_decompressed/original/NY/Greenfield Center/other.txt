UFO spotted in Greenfield Cntr. NY;2000-11-15 19:00:00;2 seconds;UFO spotted in Greenfield Cntr. NY Object was the size of a mid-sized car.  It was flat on the bottom, the top was dome shaped, it had several transparent panels separated by something solid.  There was a pulsing white light coming from inside it.  We were watching an aircraft beacon and suddenly the unidentified object was in front of the car, above and to the left.  I saw it for a fraction of a second and then it was gone.  We turned left at the next road to look for any sign of it in the sky but there was nothing there.  It made no noise.  My friend only saw the pulsing light because she was driving, but did not see the object.;43.1416;-73.8442
