This happened again 7 times until  My wife and I saw all 7 crafts slowly bouncing around and flickering in a vertical pattern as if looking directly at the pole barn with all the Christmas display lights on it....I asked my wife to quickly get phone and record...she ran inside and in that time the lower craft and its lights slowly flickered and went out one after the other until only the original craft was left still lit which eventuallly slowly flickered out as well.....My wife was able to snap a quick picture which we have of the last craft still lit....;42.7511;-75.1635
