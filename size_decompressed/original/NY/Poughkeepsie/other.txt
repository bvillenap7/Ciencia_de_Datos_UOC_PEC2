1500-2000 foot UFO seen above Mid-Hudson Bridge by Poughkeepsie, NY in July 1983.;1983-07-15 21:15:00;3 Minutes;1500-2000 foot UFO seen above Mid-Hudson Bridge by Poughkeepsie, NY in July 1983. I was the passenger in a car that crossed the Franklin D. Roosevelt Mid-Hudson Bridge to Poughkeepsie, NY at about 9:15PM. As we wended our day at about 25 mph (speed limit) down the serpentine on-ramp from the toll booths, both bridge stanchions were visible directly ahead of us. For less than 30 seconds, they were blocked from view as the road took us through blasted out rock. When we took a left turn out of the rocks and onto the bridge, an immense object was directly ahead of us, hovering just above the bridge(less than 100 feet). Though no surface was visible on the object, it's outline was traced by thousands of multi-colored lights, many in motion. My friend and I simultaneously shouted, holy shit, as we drove across the span, which the bridge authority later told me was about 3,000 feet. Parked at our end of the bridge, it's length extended 2/3rds+ of the way across it, or approximately 2000 feet, and certainly no less than 1500. As we drove across the span, it was visible out of every window in the car for most of our crossing.  About halfway across, I rolled the window down and looked directly up at it, as my friend white-knuckled the steering wheel, repeatedly uttering, I'm not stopping, I'm not stopping. It was completely silent, and many of the lights underneath were apparently rotating around a central axis at speeds that were changing often. The strange thing is that they didn't appear to accelerate or decelerate, but were instantly going different speeds, like the speeds were quantized. Some of the lights were detached from the main object and rotating around the central point at some distance. A glowing spherical orb of an orangish color was about 25 feet from my head, just beyond the bridge girders, moving with us. About a half mile south of the bridge, a smaller lighted object was hovering above the river channel, which may have been the more commonly seen-then and there-chevron shaped UFO seen edge on. As we got across the bridge, to the top of the hill, at Market! street, I turned and saw that it was still there, in the same position it had been. Note that this immense object had to have silently moved out of nowhere to just above the bridge in the 30 seconds that it was not in our line of sight. The night of this sighting, the local radio stated that 1500 people reported seeing it, including numerous police, doctors and nurses at Vassar Hospital.

1/10/08 Poughkeepsie,NY 20:05 Circular/Sphere with 4 pods 200 feet above ground;2008-01-10 20:05:00;3 mins;1/10/08 Poughkeepsie,NY 20:05 Circular/Sphere with 4 pods 200 feet above ground I am a registered nurse who does not believe in UFO's and am skeptical about their sightings.  On January 10, 2008 while walking my dog, I saw the following after I had researched all unusually shaped aircrafts and found absolutely none that looked like what I had seen that evening.   The object was a saucer shape with 4 rounded pods protruding from the sides.  It was white, possibly light grey in color.  Under each pod there were alternating dull red/blue lights under each pod.  The craft was approximately 200 feet above the ground, no sound just gliding.  When it came directly over me, there was sort of an emptiness to the environment sort of a black hole if you will.  It hovered over me for a few seconds then came a sound of the engine revving up.  The space craft then picked up speed, travelled approximately 2 miles then disappeared into the air.  After this incident, I looked up the hill where I was and saw a dark figure with a bright blue light that did not reflect light as a traditional flashlight would walking towards me.  My Labrador Retriever kept looking in the direction of this image and wanted to go towards it.  I ran towards my home all the while pulling the dog.  When I came into the house, the dog ran up the stairs and looked out the window and began to bark incessantly with his hair standing on end.  I no longer saw the image.  I did not want to call the police because I thought that they would think I was unstable.  I am writing to you at the prompting of a few friends who believe this will be helpful.;41.7004169590644;-73.8936413255366
