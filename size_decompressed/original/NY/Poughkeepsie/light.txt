Red light in the night sky.;2003-11-15 11:30:00;1-2 min;Red light in the night sky. it was late on a saturday night in november, two of my sons were playing video games and i was waiting up for the oldest to come home from his job as a waiter.  i wanted a cigarrette and decided to go outside since i just watched a commercial on second hand smoke.  it was a little warm for november so it was enjoyable.  i had taken my boys out at night for years to look for satellites and had no issue distinguishing between jets and other aircraft.  the sky was cloudless and as starfilled as you can get in a small city.  my front door faces east and slightly off to my right is the orion constellation.  i see what appears to be a satellite coming through orion in my dirrection.  no blinking lights, very uniform motion, however it was deep red in color.  i call for the boys to come see this and they ran out quickly.  it was clearly visible to them without any need for their eyes to adjust.  it maintained its course but started to slow down until we were looking straight up to see it when it stopped.  it remained stationary for a few seconds then started to ping pong around for lack of a better term.  it would move in on dirrection then change course instantly with no noticible deceleration.  as it was doing this it started to become fainter until it faded out.  my youngest sons science teacher has a home high on a hill in a rural area and is an avid skywatcher.  she began telling the kids about a very unusual light she observed the previous saturday night when zack spoke up and described what we had seen.  their stories matched exactly.  it was a sat. night in november 2003 at approx. 11:30 however it could have been the 15th or 21st.

Several bright lights moving erratically for extended periods of time, including growing in size and brightness, and disappearing.;2005-10-31 18:00:00;1 1/2 hours;Several bright lights moving erratically for extended periods of time, including growing in size and brightness, and disappearing. On the night of halloween, October 31st at 6:00 to 7:30 PM in Poughkeepsie NY two college students observed several unidentified flying objects, over a course of an hour and a half.  It could have been one object disappearing and then reappearing, or several different ones.  It was a large, bright, orange light the size of a large planet that was moving erratically for continuous periods of time ranging up to 30 minutes.  It was moving, stopping, hovering, then moving, going up and down, side to side, and in curving arcs with akward angles.  It appeared to move fast and with great agility. In addition there was a sharp, crisp, but slow-moving streak of light across the sky as an outlined object descended consistently in a straight line over a large area of the sky and heading directly to the large orange object described above.  This streaking object disappeared right before reaching the actual object.  This orange object eventually disappeared behind the trees.  It was found later at another point in the sky - on the opposite horizon.  This appeared suddenly - in a point in the sky earlier scanned - it had not been seen there moments before.  This one moved erratically for two minutes as before and then suddenly grew in light, color, and size - to an overwhelming and startling appearance - this flash/flare was 2 seconds in length, after which it disappeared entirely.  Finally another bright orange orb appeared, moved consistenly in one direction across a large portion of the sky before akwardly and suddenly reversing direction, angling downwards towards the horizon.  This object then grew in intensity and brightness and size, with sharp and protruding white light, in such a fashion as to create the distinct impression that it was coming closer to the viewers - approaching the point of observation. This action caused fear for the viewers as well as immense apprehension, to the point where one viewer began running away towards the vehicle out of fear and panic.  The object quickly thereafter diminished and turned to another direction. The final phenomenon was a different bright red light above the horizon to the East that both viewers saw clearly at the same moment. It then disappeared from view - vanishing - while in the periphery of both viewer's vision and was afterwards nowhere to be found. This occurred from 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm on Monday, October 31st, 2005, over the Vassar College Farm in Poughkeepsie New York.;41.7004169590644;-73.8936413255366
four lights expanding and then converging moving with me while I was driving...still visible outside;2009-10-17 08:30:00;two hours still happening;four lights expanding and then converging moving with me while I was driving...still visible outside Got off 87 going to my girlfriends house and saw four lights up in sky. Ive never fully believed this stuff just got a little frightened by the videos. But this shit was crazy. I noticed these four lights and they converged and then expanded out then converged.  This was weird but I thought maybe it was just searchlights. But the lights moved with me from the right of me to the left of me.  Still converging and expanding and it followed me down around turns all the way to the MidHudson bridge.  Then it was lost in the light pollution.  But I got to my girlfriends house and it is still visible outside. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.7004169590644;-73.8936413255366
Single perfect sphere of white light in clear blue sky over Hudson River.  ((anonymous report));2018-01-12 15:55:00;1 minute;Single perfect sphere of white light in clear blue sky over Hudson River.  It soon dipped down behind low-hanging cloud formation below, and did not reappear.   At first I guessed that it was a reflection off a plane (2 airports are nearby), but I don’t see how that’s possible because the sun was behind it.
