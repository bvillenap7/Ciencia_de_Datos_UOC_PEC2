I must tell you he was a non believer.  I really had my doubts.   When I looked where he was pointing in the sky sure enough, I saw it myself.  This was in broad daylight.  It was just above the clouds over the Mid-Hudson-Bridge in the southwest sky.  I would say about the same height as the cumulus clouds.  It stood still for abound 1 to 2 minutes, then suddenly flipped on its side. It was visible as heck.  The Sun shown a reflection off the craft and it was unmistakable.  It seemed to have a small dome on top.  Then it flipped parallel again to the horizon.  Stood there for quite a few seconds, then suddenly took off, faster than the human eye could trace.  It was metallic and shiny.   There is no doubt in our minds even today of what we witnessed.  To this day I know we witnessed something beyond this Earth.  I just wish I did not wait so long to report this.   We both seen it in broad daylight, and I assure everyone, this was real and not of this Earth.

Alien ship appears near synagogue.;2010-01-20 19:00:00;about 15 minutes;Alien ship appears near synagogue. I was walking from my car to my synagogue to go to religious school when I saw a giant bright saucer emitting strange lights in the sky. It also was flashing from blue and green and sending laser lights to the ground. It then emitted a humming sound. I do not know what happened next because I had to go in to get to class, but about 30 seconds after I went in, I heard a louder humming noise and a crash outside. I did not see anything else because I was inside.;41.7004169590644;-73.8936413255366
