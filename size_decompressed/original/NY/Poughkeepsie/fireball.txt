Fireball hovering in the night sky;2011-07-19 22:00:00;5 mins;Fireball hovering in the night sky It was around 10 pm, I was leaving my job with my co-worker as I noticed something in the sky.  It was a amber- orange colored light that looked like a large fireball.   We both stopped in our tracks to look at it and I noticed that it seemed to be hovering.  At the same time that we were looking at it a plane passed by so that's how we both knew it couldn't of been a plane.  After about 5 minutes of watching it I noticed it started moving very slowly straight up.  I found it weird because it didn't move at an angle at all, it was moving directly north.   I wish I stayed longer to watch it, but I felt like staring at the sky in the middle of a mall parking lot was long enough  lol ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate, which we do not understand, given that it had occurred only 34 hours before the report was submitted.

3 bright orange orbs and 1 dark color one flying over Marist College New York;2015-10-11 19:00:00;1 minute;3 bright orange orbs and 1 dark color one flying over Marist College New York Was waiting to pick up my son who was visiting a friend at Marist College near Donnelly Hall when while sitting in the car we noticed two bright orange objects in the sky following each other, while trying to figure out what we were looking at, we noticed another dark oval shape object following behind the first two with another bright orange object following behind the dark one, all travelling slowly in a straight line.  Bright orange objects appeared to flicker and dim and just disappear.  It was a wide open sky with no obstructions and objects were gone.  Drove around the campus quickly to see if we could see anything in the sky and nothing.  Sighting lasted for about a minute.
