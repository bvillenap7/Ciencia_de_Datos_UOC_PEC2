Observer has a learning disability and has been in counseling regarding this issue.  Given these facts, he is a careful observer, and takes care not to overreact to any situation.  Observer saw 3 lights in the sky.... brighter than all others, which seemed to outline a triangular shape... black in color... which seemed to be rotating along a verticle axis.  Object outline about 100 yards wide.  No noise detected.  Observer looked around at the rest of the sky and noticed no stars whatsoever on this night... and wondered as to why just these 3 lights were visible.  Observer noticed  beam of light  that seemed to go back and forth among the 3 lights, which changed coler from red, to brown, to blue.  Observer out of curiosity decided to flash car headlights in a sequence in the direction of these lights.  Object seemed to flash its lights and disappeared.  It later reappeared.  Observer is careful not to jump to conclusions and wonders if there were any other reports in the area.;41.7004169590644;-73.8936413255366
Triangel in the sky;2001-10-13 00:45:00;45 min;Triangel in the sky It was last sat night.10/13/01. My wife, myself and two friends where driving back from a haunted hay ride in poughkeepsie,NY. We where driving south on the NY state thruway back to NJ. It was a nice night and very clear. I opened the sun roof and was looking at the stars. As I was looking at the stars and saying how nice they where tonight, the others started looking at them too. Then I think it was my wife sitting in the backseat with her friend sayed look at that really bright star, she asked me if it was the north. I said no because we where looking east and low on the horizon. As I really looked at it, it appeared to move . I asked my friend to pull over. We stoped and really took a good look at this thing. Thier is no dout in my mind what we where looking at was no a star! It was moving in odd formations. So we thought it was a pland moving across the sky. But after a minute or two it was still in the same spot,but moving up then to the left , right ,down, it would even dim then become very bright again. Then move in ciculare motions, then dim out completely . Then BAM brighten up again.The shape of this THING was a triangel and very bright, I don't know what it was but.. It was something and I hope I have the oppertunity to see it again. ((NUFORC Note:  If the sighting occurred Saturday night at 12:45 p.m., we suspect the witness means Sunday morning at 0045 hrs..  We have changed the report accordingly.  PD));41.7004169590644;-73.8936413255366

Triangular flying object with white lights on each angle and green light in the middle. Traveled at un-normal flying speeds.;2015-06-28 21:30:00;30 seconds;Triangluar flying object with white lights on each angle and green light in the middle. Traveled at un-normal flying speeds While driving with a couple friends and myself, I saw a flying object, which appeared to be an airplane in the distance, and had a blinking, bright green light.  It was traveling in the same direction (parallel) as the car.   It was moving at intense speeds, but I thought nothing at the time, for it is like watching the moon while in a car it seems to follow you.  (For what i thought).   The aircraft changed course perpendicular to my car.  It flew right over the car and thats when everyone else in the car noticed it.  As it was directly over the car, we all saw it was a triangular flying object, which had white lights on the bottom of the aircraft on each angle.  Also, a blinking green light in the middle of the triangle.  (Hence, the bright green light I saw first.)  It zoomed pass us in the perpendicular direction at an un-normal speed and disappeared in a heartbeat.   (ALL WITNESSES SAW THE SAME EXACT THING, WE WERE IN SHOCK.  Also, we were all sober.) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrects date.  Terrestrial aircraft do not have blinking green lights.  PD));41.7004169590644;-73.8936413255366
