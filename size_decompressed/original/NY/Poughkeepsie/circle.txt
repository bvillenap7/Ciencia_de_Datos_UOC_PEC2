Circular craft with green, white/yellow lights hovering over front yard in Poughkeepsie, NY seen by two adults and one child;1975-08-01 20:00:00;15 min;Circular craft with green, white/yellow lights hovering over front yard in Poughkeepsie, NY seen by two adults and one child It was a summer evening. I’m guessing in 1974-76. I was around 4 to 6 years old. I was outside our house, in the front yard, standing with my mother and our neighbor, who was also an adult. I’d always been aware of a vague memory of us seeing a ufo in the front yard that night. I half dismissed it as a dream. Decades later, I saw something on TV and felt the memory rush back very real, and I asked my mother that night over the phone if it really happened. She said it was real and remembered it quite well. We both remember it as circular, and it hovered above us silently with green and white or yellow lights. She said it was up in the sky and later just went away. I believe at some point the lights appeared in more colors and slowly blinked in an entrancing way.  I think I remember them pointing at it and speculating what it could be. My mother said we never found out what it was. I also have a vague memory of running back to them from the side yard as they w! ere calling for me. I can’t remember whether I saw it first, then wandered off or vice versa. I have another strange memory of later hearing my mother say to my Dad, “How does a child just disappear? That child vanished. I was holding her wrist. I’m telling you she vanished.” I knew they were talking about me. I wish I could remember more and know for sure what really happened that night.;41.7004169590644;-73.8936413255366
