Five lights over my car in the Catskills.;1993-12-05 01:00:00;10 minutes;Five lights over my car in the Catskills. While driving north on the Taconic State Parkway, early in the morning, the fog very dense in patches, I noticed a light shining down on the north side of the parkway about 50 yards in the distance. The light seemed to come from what I thought was very late night construction. As I drove closer I noticed how strange it was that there were no cars behind me. I slowed as I approached and stopped directly under five lights that were in a pentagon pattern about 10 - 15 feet apart from each other and about 20 feet above me. I stared up through my windshield and opened my window to see better. My heart was racing. I noticed no sound, from anywhere. Everything seemed very quiet, strangely quiet. Fear overcame me and I drove off, watching the light fade in my mirror. My normal travel time for this trip was always about 2.5 hours. That evening it took me 4.5 hours to arrive. Never thought I sat there for more than 10 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD));41.7004169590644;-73.8936413255366
7-9  dull red balls of light seen in high speed chevron shape;2007-01-06 19:00:00;2-4 seconds;7-9  dull red balls of light seen in high speed chevron shape While debating whether to take out my telescope, I was looking at the night sky when 7-9 dull red balls (?) in an  incomplete cheveron shape (only two lights on one side with 5-7 on the other) streaked due directly South.  Appeared to be very high altitude, did not seem like one solid craft as light sources seemed to lurch forward, then slow independently of one another. Maybe a meteorite had broken up?   Did not look like any other meteorite I've seen as all light sources appeared steady in brightness, and chevron pattern did not change.  From visible horizon to horizon is several seconds.;41.7004169590644;-73.8936413255366

Each time during and after fireworks from neighbor were setoff.   Empirically, this object moved at incredible speeds (vertical and horizontal in particular) object moved across the sky to where fireworks were igniting in sky.   Besides the speed, what caught my attention was the object displayed two quick on and off light display.  As if it was taking a picture.
