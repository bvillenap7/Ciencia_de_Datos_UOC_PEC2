Trangular shape with red base color and three yellow lights at points of triangle seen moving no sound.;2012-03-24 21:15:00;4 minutes;Trangular shape with red base color and three yellow lights at points of triangle seen moving no sound. At about 9:15 p.m. (the Syracuse basketball game was almost over) my sister saw a lighted object float past the skylight in her living room in the town of Farmington, NY. She went to her sliding glass doors by her deck, saw it, and called me over. We saw a triangular shape in the sky that was moving slowly that was a bright base color of red that had three yellowish lights at each corner of the object. The lights were constant with no discernible pulsations nor was there any engine noise heard. It moved in a straight line, stopped a few times, appearing to shift slightly to the left and/or right while stopped. It then kept slowly moving and simply winked out after about four minutes of observation. It was cloudy that night so we could not tell if it disappeared into the clouds to create this slow winking out.;42.9580000000001;-77.3083
