Single white light moving erratically.;2019-09-21 21:00:00;30 seconds;Single white light moving erratically. At about 9 p.m. I was out back at a friendâ€™s house preparing for a campfire.  I looked up into the sky facing north.  I saw a steady white light about the size of a star moving from west to east.  At first I thought it was a plane but there were no strobe lights flashing.  At first it moved in a straight line.  After watching about 10 seconds it started moving erratically.  Up and down, left and right.  I called to my son-in-law who also saw it.  While still moving erratically, it disappeared behind a tree.  Total observation time was about 30 seconds.  It appeared to be high in the sky.  The size did not change while observing it.;42.9580000000001;-77.3083
