I was driving on Crescent Avenue near Kaydeross avenue. Where the road passes over a tributary of Kaydeross Creek is a low, swampy field with a hill line on either side.The creek, which connects Lake Lonely to Saratoga Lake floods this area every spring,and the stretch of land between the two lakes is undeveloped.A bright light over the dark field drew my attention,I turned my head and saw a sphere hovering very low,just above the bare trees, about 70 feet off the ground and about 150 feet from the road. The sphere had a warm orange glow,the light it gave off was like a flare or sparkler,with tiny sparks of red,yellow,orange,even green and blue.It wasn't lit from external lights,it was lit from within and its entire surface glowed.Its color changed from yellow to green to red to white to blue,changing colors constantly and almost instantly.It was spinning rapidly,not east/west like a globe,but in a south/north spin.As it spun it revealed strange repeating designs,dark bands,question marks,star patterns and squiggles,,particularly interesting is a trident-like design,and the patterns change colors as well. I pulled over,put my car into park,turned on my camcorder and began filming.It started floating to the south away from me soon after I started filming,but I captured it for over a minute, and the features I describe are clear.Freeze-frame shows how quickly and how certainly remarkable designs and patterns cover this craft.;43.0592000000009;-73.7356
