I was driving to work on I-87 South bound, between exits 14 and 13, and all of a sudden, I saw an object, flying from the northeast toward the south.  I thought at first it was a plane crashing because of the size.  It was massive.  The size was approximately 30 yards across and it was in the shape of a mushroom/whale tail, almost triangular, but not.  The color was bright neon green and there was a darker neon green light around the perimeter of the object and then a lighter neon green light on the inner part.   This object just appeared in the sky and lit up and then disappeared again.  It was traveling so fast, similar to shooting star speed.  And the length of time I saw it was approximately 3 seconds.  It was also about 1/4 mile in the air, as thought it seemed.  It was low, like a plane would be if it's in mid-landing.;43.0592000000009;-73.7356
