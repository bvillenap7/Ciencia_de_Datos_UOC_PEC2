As I got closer it stayed in the exact same spot and I was eventually underneath it, it was not very large and was fairly low I could tell probably about 100-200 feet up just sitting.  I was actually a triangle of 3 lights underneath and the 2 blinking side ones.  Then it began to move, not very quickly - about 50-60 mph and I followed down the road until it was going a bit faster out over a field where I noticed 3 other identicle blinking lights that went towards each other and away.;43.0592000000009;-73.7356
