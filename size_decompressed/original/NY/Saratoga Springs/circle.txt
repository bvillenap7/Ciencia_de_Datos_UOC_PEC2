PD));2012-10-11 19:45:00;5 minutes;A brightly lit object, twice the size of a planet,  traversed the night sky, dimmed, and disappeared from view Thursday, October 11, 2012 While walking this evening, my daughter and I observed an intensely bright white light, twice the size of a star/planet when observed in a cloudless, star-filled sky. The object slowly traversed the night sky from south to north.  There was no noise other airplanes noticeably dotted the sky.  The moving object had no other lights that were visible to us.  It continued on its path when all of a sudden, its brightness dimmed, and it completely disappeared from our view. We stood there several minutes, waiting for it to return but, it didnâ€™t appear.
