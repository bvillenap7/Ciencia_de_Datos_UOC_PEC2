A few minutes later,I peered out my window and i thought that it,whatevr it was , was gone so i headed outside again one last time.As i went outside,i  noticed that the craft was gone so i said to myself you must be dreaming.So i sat out for a few minutes.In no time at all,rather than there being 1 craft ,there was 3.This made me scared out of my wits so i ran inside to the safety of my home .I watched them from inside and it wasn't until 2 hours later that they left. I was never a firm beliver of UFO's,but now that i have witnessed this,  now my thoughts have changed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));43.8421;-73.7729
