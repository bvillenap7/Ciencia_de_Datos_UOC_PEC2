Two bright lights moving single-file and steadily across the night sky;2009-11-26 18:30:00;a few minutes;Two bright lights moving single-file and steadily across the night sky two objects moving across the early night sky, in single file, one a little ways behind the other, both moving at uniform speed along the same line. We thought at first they might be satellites, but were moving faster and were much much brighter than any satellites we'd ever seen.  Neither were they airplanes...no colored or blinking/flshing lights whatsoever.  Looked like two bright bright stars, otherwise.  They were moving from north to south, not in a hurry.;40.9352;-73.8341
