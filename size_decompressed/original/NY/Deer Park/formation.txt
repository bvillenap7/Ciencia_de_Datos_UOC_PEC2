Formation of orange/amber lights;2016-10-24 23:30:00;10 seconds;Formation of orange/amber lights On October 24th, 2016, about 11:30 est, I noticed a ragged line of five or six very dim orange lights (roughly the color but considerably dimmer than a neon bulb) about the width of my palm at arm's length.   Each individual light round with a dark border and a bit smaller than the fingernail over my pinky finger.  They silently crossed the sky broadside from east to west, across the constellation of Perseus in the space of about three or four seconds.;40.7621;-73.3312999999999
