I can also tell you just about anything that has to do with Military or civilian aircraft. This was mind blowing and I thought nothing like this could exist. I was out side cleaning up leaves and heard an another aircraft at the usual 2500ft by my home. Usually 1 every 60 seconds or so. I look up at just about everyone. This aircraft had a round craft following close behind it. I'd say 20 to 30nfeet behind the tail. Even with the fuselage from my vantage point. The craft was probably the size of a car. I cant believe what I was seeing. I then needed proof.. a witness. So I had a choice to video it or get my wife. I chose to get my wife. Bad choice, by the time she got out it was just about out of site. It was a round craft that kept the same distance the 20 seconds or so I witnessed it. I will be looking for any public cams that might have seen something. My home security cams sees me running into the house to get my wire at 16:29.33sec It took us 15 seconds to come back outside. It was still tailing the jet and I lost sight in the distance behind trees. There are so many ppl that live in this area someone else had to see this.;40.7621;-73.3312999999999
