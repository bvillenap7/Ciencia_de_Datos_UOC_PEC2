Bright star suddenly moves then disappears.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible flare from an Iridium satellite?  PD));2013-08-03 04:05:00;5 seconds;Bright star suddenly moves then disappears.. At approximately 4:05AM while standing in front of my home, I suddenly saw a dim light reflection on the front of my house.  I looked up to the sky in an easterly direction at about 60 degrees where 0 degrees is the horizon and 90 degrees is directly overhead.   I saw what I originally thought was Venus but then the light started to move slowly in a southeast direction for about 4-5 seconds and then disappear.  The light was a blueish/white “clean” light that looked like a bright star, but the light remained constant and did not flicker.   The movement was slow and linear.  There were some clouds in the area, but none in the visual range of the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

3 flying flashing objects in triangle formation.;2013-09-15 20:00:00;5 minutes;3 flying flashing objects in triangle formation. Was looking to the south sky and noticed 3 lights flashing quickly in a side ways triangle shape.  They were heading west.  The color looked to be reddish.   Basically I saw from directly looking south and they were going west in sky as far as I could.  The spacing of the lights were not close to be same object but 3 separate.   Before I saw these lights there was a plane with a bright light that's what actually caught my attention.;40.7621;-73.3312999999999
Over 20 red lights in a long zig zag row over Deer Park, NY forming a zig zag pattern headed east to west / west to east.;2016-07-30 21:15:00;15 minutes;Over 20 red lights in a long zig zag row over Deer Park, NY forming a zig zag pattern headed east to west / west to east. At approximately 9:15 pm tonight, 7/30/16, my wife and I were driving home from Deer Park, NY.  It had been raining most of the afternoon and part of the evening, when the rain subsided, and the skies finally started to clear a bit.   Suddenly, directly above me and in front headed West to East, I saw a series of red lights in the sky.  It looked like a zig zag pattern that made like a contellation type of pattern... tough to describe!  Only it was not a constellation, but rather a series of triangular red and white lights.   There were over 20 of these and then gradually it became only 4 and then 0.   I called my in laws to run out and see this.  They stepped onto their patio and witnessed the same!  Both my inlaws and I tried to get an image or fil on our phones, but were unable to do so.  The lights were not faint...they were very bright red lights. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Thank you, Peter!  Will do! I wrote to Newsday as well in Long Island. Will see what comes up. Regards,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));40.7621;-73.3312999999999
