Driving west bound on Long Island Expressway noticed a small redish globe glow between the horizon and venus.  Around 50-70000 feet up. It was a clear sky no clouds, the sun was going down and the sky was turning colors.  This globe would shine brightly, and streak across (not very far) the sky making a contrial and then stop. The globe that was glowing red to orange would disappear. The contrail that it had made would dissapate incredibly fast.  Then it appeared again, slightly over from where it disappeared. Made a glow drew a contrail and disappeared.  It was traveling northeast, all occurances lasted 2 minutes.;40.7621;-73.3312999999999
