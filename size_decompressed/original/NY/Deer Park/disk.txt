ufo over long island, new york;2009-01-20 02:26:00;9 minutes;ufo over long island, new york While leaving the house for a family vacation we spotted something very odd shaped in sky. My wife and I not knowing anything about UFOs or anything were lost until out 25 year old son explained what it was. It then all came to us and we realized what we saw would've been a UFO. It circled in the sky for about 5-6 minutes in a weird l shape until it went south of long island to be unseen.
