Moving star over eastern New York;2007-10-01 21:00:00;4 mins;Moving star over eastern New York It was a very clear night with a decent view of the stars.  I was sitting outside just staring up and noticed what appeared to be a satellite moving across the sky.  The object looked like a star moving across the sky.  I have seen other satellites moving across the sky at consistent speeds and directions.  I watched the object and it seem to move.  I stared more intently as the object changed directions and accelerated.  It was a relatively quiet night and there was no sound.  I am an aviation professional and am positive it was not an aircraft.  The change of direction and the speed of the acceleration was unlike any aircraft I am familiar with.  The object also appeared exactly like a satellite or moving star. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));40.7621;-73.3312999999999
2 Bright Orange lights in the sky moving up, down, and circular motion with shooting streaking trail -looked like shooting star;2009-10-11 02:45:00;3 hrs;2 Bright Orange lights in the sky moving up, down, and circular motion with shooting streaking trail -looked like shooting star I came home from work at around 2am. As I was driving home, I had noticed that the moon was completely covered with clouds and on the other side, the sky was clear and the stars were bright as ever. 2 of the stars were extremely brighter than the others so when I got home I got out of my car and stood there looking up for awhile. I went inside and my fiance came home not too long after I came in.  I was telling her what I saw so she suggested that we go back outside and look again.  It was now about 2:45am and she quickly noticed exactly what I was speaking about.  They were bright orange and shiny, and located in the southern part of the sky. We both continued to look up when all of a sudden, one of the bright things started to move - first in a clockwise direction, then it went up, down, side to side and back into a circular motion. That continued for about 5 minutes when all of a sudden there was a burst of light with a trail - it almost looked like a shooting star but it never fizzled off, instead it created the trail and stopped abruptly and all of a sudden appeared another bright thing that started also moving in a circular motion, and side to side. We watched these 2 things move around the sky zipping back and forth, and creating a circular motion for about 20 minutes.  We came back inside and my fiance went to bed.  I couldn't sleep so I went back outside to see if these things were still in the sky and they were - in the same spot that they were before.  Now it was about 4am.  The objects were still moving but this time, were a little slower as if they were just hanging out.  I stayed out there for about 15 minutes and then came back in. This all occurred Saturday night/Early Sunday Morning. Sunday night / into Monday morning, one of these objects was back but this time it was in the western part of the sky. It was moving but this time it was blinking.  It definitely wasn't a plane because it stayed within the same area and never moved.  I stood outside and watched it for about 10 minutes.;40.7621;-73.3312999999999
