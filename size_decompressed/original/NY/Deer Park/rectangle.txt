lighted rectangular object seen over Deer Park Avenue;2006-10-09 21:05:00;a few seconds;lighted rectangular object seen over Deer Park Avenue We were driving on Deer Park Avenue when my son exclaimed in a very panicked voice please tell me you saw that... What the hell was that He described a large rectangular UFO outlined in yellow and then red lights that flashed suddenly as if someone flipped a light switch on and off.  He said it appeared to lift over the buildings along the street toward and in front of the nearly full moon and was gone very suddenly in a flash again as if a light switch was turned on and off.  We circled around and looked for any other evidence or any other explanation for what he saw and found nothing.  My other son and I did hear a sort of whoosh sound almost like when a fuse blows right before he saw the object but our attention was on the road in front of us and we did not see the object. We arrived home shortly after that and I noticed aircraft in the area.  Also, my dogs were behaving somewhat unusually and were more on edge than normal.
