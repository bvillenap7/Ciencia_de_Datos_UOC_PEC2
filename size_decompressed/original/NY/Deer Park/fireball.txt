Fireball-like light looked as if it was crashing into near by Harbor (Long Island, NY);2007-01-25 20:30:00;3-5 Seconds;Fireball-like light looked as if it was crashing into near by Harbor (Long Island, NY) Looking north, I thought I had seen what may have been a plane.  Then, it dropped quite fast on a 90 degree angle. At first, I thought it was might have been fireworks but the light was traveling straight and then dipped extremely fast (and it looked very controlled).  The object was far enough that it looked as if it may have crashed in Bayshore Harbor.  (I'm about 4 miles from the water but can see it on clear nights);40.7621;-73.3312999999999
