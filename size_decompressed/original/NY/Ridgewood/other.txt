Strange object seen standing still for more then 30 seconds.;2005-08-07 18:00:00;20-30 Minutes;Strange object seen standing still for more then 30 seconds. I was sitting out in front of my house when I saw this strange object moving in the sky. At first I thought it may have been a baloon, but it was so high up and it came to a complete stop.  I watched for about 30 seconds and when it still did not move, I ran in and grabbed my mothers digital camera. When I got back outside about 10 seconds later, it was moving again, but very slowly.  It resembles a half crescent of some sort and was constantly flipping sides, it looked like a ribbon dancing in the air. I did see a couple planes in the same area at the time, there was one that passed by very close. I took one photo where I was barly zoomed in at all, this shows the distance on the object. The second photo I took, I zoomed in as much as possible.;40.7012666666667;-73.8934666666667

(sorry for my bad English)   Also, i am 13 and i am scared about this.  i haven't been able to sleep for days. Me and some of my buddies were going out for biking. there were some clouds on the sky and was a sunny day. me and my friends were out on the streets biking near a graveyard. then, some of the clouds started to turn green. either that, or green smoke appeared in the clouds out of nowhere. then, a rocket-like (rocket shaped) object appeared from the green cloud. what happened next was unbelievable... the object disappeared and reappeared several times on different places in the sky. and then, the shape of the object changed the third time it reappeared. the object's new shape looked somewhat like this:  ()===() another time it changed its shape, it looked like this: ()() so i think that the ufo teleported in the different places in the sky. it disappeared and repappeared for about 20 times. and it changed its shape. my other 8 friends saw this too. and since i am living in new york, i am sure many other people saw this too. they should have.
