White/silver oval shape flying and then disappeared over Brooklyn.;2012-10-17 17:55:00;2-3 minutes;White/silver oval shape flying and then disappeared over Brooklyn There was a white/silver oval shape flying horizontally through the sky either over the massive cemetery in the area or over Long Island,  I guess depending on how big it is.  It went from left to right across the sky and then quickly started to descend.  Then it stopped and dropped straight down.   Then it disappeared.   Definitely did not look like a plane, and did not move like anything I have ever seen before.  It was fast and erratic.;40.7012666666667;-73.8934666666667
