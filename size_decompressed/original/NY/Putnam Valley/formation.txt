I would say that it covered the whole sky area that I looked at, flashing lighs, seemed to be low in area, stood there and looked at it, no one else seemed to notice, by the way was stopping at a loc at an IGA store to purchase something, looked up for some reason and saw it,don't think any one esle noticed it, still bothers me today!;41.3728;-73.8502
