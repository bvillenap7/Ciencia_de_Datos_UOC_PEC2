Odd Glowing Orb in front of Citybank building;2000-06-18 04:30:00;@ 3 minutes;Odd Glowing Orb in front of Citybank building Heres how it happened I was sleepin becasue I had school in the morning, and i wooke out of a dead sleep for no reason and I looked in the direction of the Manhatten skyline becasue its what i see form my bedroom window.  Right in front of the Citybank building (the one in Queens) I see this bright white circular light.  and at first i blink a few times becasue I thought it was just the sleep still in my eyes.  but I woke up totally (sorta) and it was still there.  i stared at it for a few minutes maybe like 10 or fifteen ans it didn't move at all.  so instead of continuing to stare at it i decided to go back to sleep.  I'm no kooke who just reports things i saw this and i need to tell somone so i figured this would be the best way to do it thanx much.
