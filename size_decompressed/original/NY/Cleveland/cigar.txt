It had a grey colored stripe in the very center and it was a fat stripe. It seemed to be wrapped all around the object. I was swimming at my sisters house in her pool. Me, my brother and my sister were there with her four kids. We noticed a cigar shaped objecy flying across the sky. It looked like a very bright shiney metal, silver color like aluminum foil color. It had a pewter colored ring around the very center and it was a fat ring. It appeared to be wrapped all around the object.<like a ring would look on a finger> It moved across the sky at a tremendously fast pace, faster than any aircraft I have ever witnessed before. It did not have any skylines behind it and it did not make any sound. It was high up, but it was like it was just there...no lights, no engine sounds, no smoke trails or anything. Just there. It flew into clouds and then it was gone. It didn't tke a long time for the whole event to occur, 30 seconds or so and it was over. My sister told me afterwards that she and my brother had witnessed it at an earlier date. We were all very freaked out about it. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness meant 3:00 p.m., since children probably would not be swimming and 0300 hrs..  We have changed the time here.  PD));43.242;-75.8584
