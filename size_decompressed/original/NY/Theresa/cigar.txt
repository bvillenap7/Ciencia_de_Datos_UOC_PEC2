PD));2012-09-15 19:00:00;30 seconds;The only thing I could think of is that it looks like a missile. At about 7 pm this evening on sept 15 I witnessed a white cigar shaped aircraft flying at a heading (from my location) of about 40 degrees northeast. I watched it for about 20 to 30 seconds flying in completely clear blue skies and never saw anything that resembled wings on it.  It seemed to be at about 20 thousand or more in altitude, hard to say.  t also seemed to be moving faster than a regular passenger jet.  There was no sound whatso ever.   I have been an aircraft mechanic for 27 years.;44.2094;-75.7979
