PD));2012-02-28 22:20:00;1 second;Green/Blue tear drop shape shot down from the sky, emitting a bright white light after passing the horizon line. The object was a bright green orb like shape, it shot down from the sky, literally out of nowhere, it was about 1 whole second for that whole sighting, it came to the horizon and basically made some type of explosion, I did not hear anything from it, in my guess about 15-30 miles or more away from the position I was driving.  It did make a bright white light once it past the horizon, and that is what I assume its explosion of some sort. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));42.9174;-73.7209
