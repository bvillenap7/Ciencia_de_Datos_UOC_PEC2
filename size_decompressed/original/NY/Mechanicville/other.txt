3 fires hovering over the hudson river in a triangle formation.;2011-11-03 17:03:00;5 min;3 fires hovering over the hudson river in a triangle formation. I saw 3 Fires hovering on top of the Hudson River in a triangle formation.  I could tell that it wasn't in the water because the river was flowing pretty good and I figured that if it was something burning that it would have moved with the water.  I checked for reflections of some sort but I could not find any thing. I kept my eyes on it because I didn't want it to disappear before my co-worker came out. I asked him what he could see while I was pointing to it.  He said it looked like fire he said he has never seen that before. I have never seen anything like it.  It burned out a few minutes after that. It reminded me of burner like on a gas stove.  The sky was cloudy and the water showed no sign of displacement.  And the sounds were normal.  Hope there is some sort of explanation for this occurrence. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));42.9174;-73.7209
