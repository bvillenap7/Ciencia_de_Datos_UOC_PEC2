bright orb light in sky moving slowly not plane or star;2012-05-13 21:00:00;1 hour;bright orb light in sky moving slowly not plane or star There was a bright cirlce west of mechanicville hovering in the sky. It was too bright to be a star but, was not moving fast so it could not be an airplane.  My boyfriend and myself watched it for over an hour and it seemsed to only barely move.  Then upon going back outside on our porch it was just gone.  Neither of us can explain what it was.;42.9174;-73.7209
