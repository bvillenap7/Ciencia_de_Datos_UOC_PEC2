It was stationary for 5-7 minutes, then moved across the window. I was up with my dog at 4:00a.m. and saw a small (pea-sized) blinking, white light outside my window.  I was outside when I first saw it, and it was about 12 inches from my head.  It was a very bright, white, blinking light.  I went inside and watched it for several minutes. There was no beam and it was not a laser.  It was stationary for several minutes, and then it slowly moved across the window.  I ran and got a flashlight, and when I came back, it was gone.  It did not make any sound.  It was not an insect, and it was not a drone.  It wasn’t a sold object.  It was just a bright, white light.  I am a 72 year old woman with all of my faculties.  I rarely drink, and had not been drinking the night before this happened.  I’ve never taken any illegal drugs and am not on any narcotics of any kind.  I am a former school teacher.  I’m a wife, mother, and grandmother.  I’ve never witnessed anything like this before, but I am positive this is what I saw.;43.1864999999999;-77.8028000000001
