Orange sphere flying in an S pattern in Western NY.;2018-07-06 22:00:00;10 minutes;Orange sphere flying in an S pattern in Western NY. I saw a bright orange spherical object moving fast across the sky that caught my attention.  It was moving around in a a wiggly S pattern which I thought was peculiar and I knew planes could not fly this way.  It also had no discernible shape, it was just a ball of light, so I didn't think it was a plane.  I observed it for several minutes so I also did not think it was some sort of stray firework or something.  When I grabbed my phone to begin taking video, the object completely disappeared!  A few moments later I saw two planes in the sky with rapidly blinking lights.  The planes were going in opposite directions around the area where I had previously seen the orange ball of light.  The ball of light then returned and shot out between the two planes at a much higher rate of speed than either plane was flying.  The ball of light then winked out, then came back along the same path, then winked out, then came back again, then finally winked out and was gone for good. The planes continued on their trajectories for another moment and then both planes were also gone.;43.1864999999999;-77.8028000000001
