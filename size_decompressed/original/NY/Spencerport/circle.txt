Three Flaming Balls Over Spencerport, NY;2016-08-27 21:25:00;8 minutes;Three Flaming Balls Over Spencerport, NY On 8/27/2016, at 9:25 PM, in Spencerport, NY, (a suburb of Rochester, NY), my husband, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, mother-in-law, and family friend, had finished dinner on the outdoor patio, and were enjoying after dinner conversations around the table, when my brother-in-law pointed to the sky and said, “Look!”   To the Northeast, a flaming circle flew across the sky at an unusually high rate-of-speed.  The object changed shapes from a circle to a cone and back to a circle and seemed to have something like a satellite flying around it.  As it burned across the sky, it started to flicker and then appeared to burn out or vanish.   This was followed by two more in almost perfect time.  Once one burned out the next appeared back to the East.  The third object appeared to travel on a z-axis to out of our atmosphere. Shortly, after all three “flaming” balls had disappeared, what we think had to be three military jets (they were blinking and way too fast to be commercial liners) appeared in the sky, crossing each other and then flew out of sight. We waited another 15-20 minutes, but no other “flaming” objects appeared.   We were lucky enough to get video evidence of the second and third objects, but missed the first.;43.1864999999999;-77.8028000000001
