My wife and I came home from dinner at my parents late, around 11-12pm.As we climbed the steps to our 2nd storey deck which has a very large field of view, we saw a very bright light flying from 1 side of the sky to the other. It was going around in circles, reversing direction, stopping, accelerating, and then slowing down,then it would speed back up and circle around and back and forth, it was crazy. It was very far away, big, and flew all the way from one side of the sky to the other on the horizon as fast as you could move your arm with a sparkler on 4th of July. It freaked my wife out. All of a sudden she wanted to know about ufos. I own 2 local businesses, my wifes a legal secratary. It wasnt a helecoptor, meteor or anything easily explained, and it definately was controlled by something. It flew off and got so far away we couldnt see it anymore, it just faded out. It was a crystal clear night, you could see every star in the sky. We arent nuts. There was a commercial aircraft flying with wing lights flying that was closer and lower then it, and it was going way slower then the ufo. It was silent. Im not big on giving my address on the internet, but e mail me anytime. ((name deleted));40.9029764705882;-72.4126558823529
Spotted 3 red lights (UFOs) over Southampton, NY;2010-12-25 22:00:00;2 minutes;Spotted 3 red lights (UFOs) over Southampton, NY I walked outside my vacation home in the Hamptons and noticed a bright red light in the night sky. The red light was high in the north western sky.  The light was about as large as Venus appears to the naked eye,  when it is brightest shortly before sunset and shortly before sunrise.  At first, I thought I was looking at Mars, because of the red color, but Mars is not that big and bright, nor does it project such a vibrant red color to the naked eye.  Then 2 more red lights appeared and I noticed all were moving eratically.  I then called out my wife and in-laws to witness this.  It was Xmas night, so my inlaws where over.  By the time they all came out, 2 lights had disappeared, but on remained.  All saw the remaiming red light, moving eratically, until it faded away.;40.9029764705882;-72.4126558823529
