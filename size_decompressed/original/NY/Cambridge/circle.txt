Orange flaming sphere seen over cambridge, ny;2012-05-26 21:00:00;1 minute;orange flaming sphere seen over cambridge, ny Object  was roundish. It looked like it was flaming or glowing. It moved faster than a small aircraft, but made no noise. It moved in a forward motion over the home, where we were sitting.on a deck outside. One person ran inside for binoculars.  It moved west to east. After less than a minute, the flaming and glowing just went out and we could no longer see it. I saw the truangular shaped lights over phoenix in 1997, but this was very different. Def. Not a meteor or any aircraft that we have ever seen ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.0428;-73.3805
