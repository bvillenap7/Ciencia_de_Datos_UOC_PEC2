It was a long time ago, but the memmory is still clear.

My brother and I were star gazing and saw what appeared to be a LARGE vehicle that had the appearance of a conventional aircraft but it had 6 sets of wings and was dotted with lights around the perimiter of the craft. It was also silent and very close. The sighting took place around 1980, but is still etched in my mind and will be forever. My brother and I would be outside every night to look for unusual things in the sky. One night just before dark on a warm summer evening with no clouds,we were looking at the apex of the sky when all of a sudden a huge craft floated silently ovrhead. We were both stunned at what we were seeing, our jaws dropped in awe. The craft appeared to a normal convetional aircraft at first but then we realised it was no air plane. The object had 6 sets of wing like appendages and the whole exterior of the craft was dotted with white lights and what appearerd to be a runway of sorts in the center. The object moved slowly over head and was completely silent. the oject also gave the appearance of being somewhat translucent,Im not sure how to explain it. It was just light enough to see the object so it could have been a reflection of some kind. I was about 18 years old at the time and my brother would have been around 20. We never reported this untill now for fear of riddcule. We did however tell our parents and some friends but they only laughed. I feel it important to note that there were no drugs or alcohol involved in the sighting. Please let me know if anyone else has seen an object like the one described in this report. this has been on my mind for a long time. Please let me know if you need additional information.;43.079001657458;-77.6334458563539
