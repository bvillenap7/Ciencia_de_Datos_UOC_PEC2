Bright Pulsing object appears, then disappears.;2008-11-19 16:00:00;5 minutes;Bright Pulsing object appears then disappears. I was pulling into the parking lot of my school with a friend. We had just gotten ourselves food and within five minutes of parking I look to the left of us in the sky. The object at first seemed to be a star, it was dusk so I generally tend to look out at the sky. I notice this increidbyl bright star. I tell my friend to look at it and he too thinks its abnormally bright. The object then begins to dim to the point where we can barely see its there, then immediately it gets bright again. I would say this happened for about 5 minutes or so when to the left another one appears and begins to do the same thing. Now a lot of people said to me that it was a helicopter or a satellite. I have never seen a helicopter flash so brightly and then another just appear, and satellites move across the sky very fast. Anyways the two pulse for about a minute then completely disappear. Since then I hav'nt seen anything like it or heard of anything like it. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  Possible tumbling booster, giving off an intermittent flash??  PD));43.079001657458;-77.6334458563539
