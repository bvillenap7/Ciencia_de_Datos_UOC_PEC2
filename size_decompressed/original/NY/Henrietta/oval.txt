I pulled up to the light at Calkins Rd & East Henrietta Rd.  I was turning right to head south on East Henrietta when the sphere pulsated 3 times then darted off to the north quicker then I could even keep up with.   This object was first thought to be a star and or Planet.  Honestly I didn't even believe what i saw, felt like people would laugh.  Sense that day I've seen even stranger things.  Just last night I was awake watching TV.  Decided to step out on my upper apartment deck when I saw this shooting star, no later then five minutes out of no where 3 double rotor unmarked choppers fly over my complex.   Get this, they didn't make a sound!  The sound they gave off was like driving with a sun roof open and a passenger window open.  Anyway that's about it.
