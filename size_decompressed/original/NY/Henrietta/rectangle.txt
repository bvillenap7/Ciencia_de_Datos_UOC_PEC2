On March 6, 2013 at approximately 11 pm I was traveling south on Interstate 390, south of Rochester, NY when off to the south west I noticed an odd object in the sky, with a strobe on the right side but no visible landing lights or navigation lights.  There was a row of lights on the side facing me. This object was moving slowly to the west and was likely two or three miles away initially. I was moving about 50 mph due south.  As I proceeded I got to see the object, which was losing altitude, from behind and below and I was stunned at the shape.  It was rectangular, with no lights visible on the side facing away from me.  The shape was completely inconsistent with a passenger aircraft.  (See my video on you-tube for a simulation).  I never saw any landing lights or navigation lights, just the row of lights on the three sides and the one strobe light. Finally, the object appeared to be turning north right as I lost sight of it. I would estimate about a 4:3 ratio of length to width.  Video simulation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Mz1E9fKA48&list=UUiEaWQaRf0rNRDMbxCPNVTA;43.079001657458;-77.6334458563539
