This info was given to me by two people who still do not quite understand the happennings of that night. they were at a trailer park when they saw three lights of one color coming down from the skies, after a while they decided to video tape then, as they were doing it, the lights were changing speed an direction to their wish, what was driving my friend crazy, but after a while, the ligths were descending too close and the tree tops were totally lit in the colorful glow of this lights. At this point they got scared and decided to leave the place, and a they left, the ligths followed them on thir 5 to 10 minutes home, in meantime, the highway was totally lit by them and they could see them hoovering around them at different speeds, this time they could see little windows along the shape of the vehicle. Totally terrified, the girl instead of filming, would turn her head away and try not to see them, he was more calm. They got home and for a few more minutes they could see thru the windows the ligts hoovering over the place. I don't think they want to be contacted, I have anotherincident that a close relative had about ten years ago.
