BLUE LIGHTS....shinning in my window;2001-01-20 19:00:00;10 sec;BLUE LIGHTS....shinning in my window I was sitting in my bed room when a BRIGHT blue light shinned throught the windows, lighting up my whole room. It was not car lights because their were no cars and they never light up blue. I heard a scream but didnt see anything. I  couldnt have been lighting either because it lasted for a sufficent amount of time. ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.  PD));40.9015;-72.8902
