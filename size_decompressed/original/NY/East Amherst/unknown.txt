THESE THINGS HAVE NEVER BEEN PHOTGRAPHED BECAUSE THEY DO NOT EXIST OUTSIDE OF SOME PEOPLE'S MINDS.;2003-12-12 00:00:00;ALL NIGHT;THESE THINGS HAVE NEVER BEEN PHOTGRAPHED BECAUSE THEY DO NOT EXIST OUTSIDE OF SOME PEOPLE'S MINDS. Gee, I saw this amazing thing and would you believe I happened to have a camera with me? But of course the thingy photographed was way too far away and way too fuzzy and out of focus but then they ALL are out of focus and fuzzy aren't they. People get photos of about everything that ever occurs around them except those pesky UFOs I guess they really don't like their picture taken. Seriously, isn't it about time someone got a REAL photo of these imaginary things? I think so too. Now let's go and get a life. ((NUFORC Note:  We agree with the observation that if UFO's are real, and commonplace, then there should be more good photos available.  Only very few of the alleged photos of UFO's turn out to be genuine.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));43.0405;-78.7021999999999
