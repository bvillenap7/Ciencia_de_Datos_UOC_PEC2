Black triangle with six lights.;2015-07-10 22:45:00;20 seconds;I went outside to for a smoke around 22:45 pm, and was about halfway through it, when I heard what I thought was a plane.  I noticed I couldn't see the tail end of the plane at all. It got into a clearing above 2 trees, and it was easily visible, as the sky was still a dark shade of blue.  I saw a black triangle with six lights on it.  Five white, one red, and the red one was blinking.  There was a white light at the front of the craft, another behind it, and three more white lights along the back.  The blinking red light was in the center.   It glided at about the same speed as a plane across the sky, and was flying pretty low. I would say it was more or less gliding than flying.  It was also about as loud as a normal commercial jet if you were maybe 200 feet away from it.;43.0405;-78.7021999999999
