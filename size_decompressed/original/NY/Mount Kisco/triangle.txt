The object was very large. I commented to my wife (Girlfriend at the time) that a B-52 was coming towards us.  We joked that maybe it was a UFO. As it moved with a 1/2 mile distance, we stopped joking about it possibly being a UFO and we got in our car and drove quickly to a spot with more people.  We were frightened by the fact that it moved slow and made no noise.  The UFO had red and white lights around the perimeter with a smaller trailing light. We drove from a parking lot where we had just gotten off work (Caldors) and drove to a near-by gas station (ARCO).  The craft flew over our heads slowly and we watched it for 5-10 more minutes.  There were a number of people at the ARCO and all the people were stunned.  I haven't thought much about the incident since it hapened, however, the stories out of Arizona in 1997 were remarkably similar.  I believe by the descriptions, that the UFO's were the same, only they were 14 years and 2000 miles apart.  At the time, the authorities said it was a joke by ultra-light aircraft pilots. If it was ultra-light pilots, they moved to Arizona 14 years later!!;41.201;-73.7336
