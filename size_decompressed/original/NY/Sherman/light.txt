It was moving to the east as this happened. The mostion was extremly smooth, and it wwas perfectly silent. At first I thught It was a firework od the sort that shoots in the air and comes down on a parachute, but it dropped in several short, quick bursts, unlike the glide of a parachute. Its possible that someone was flying a kite with a light abd propeller attached, but it looked to be at least the altitude of a short range private aircraft, and there wasnt any wind on the ground and it moved too fast. I dont think this is outside the scope of an elaborate hoax, but if it was a hoax it was a pretty fucking good one (it also must have been moving away if it was as high as it looked because it disapeared behind the treeline. my friend:I was looking over the shoulder of my freind and I happen to see a star like object yet much brighter.I slowly watched this object move in the northeast to the east. As i watched I lost site of it over the trees.;42.1618;-79.5797
