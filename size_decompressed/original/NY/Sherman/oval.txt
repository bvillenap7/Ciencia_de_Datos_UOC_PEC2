Light Blue Oval over Campground;2001-07-07 00:18:00;less than 2 minutes;Light Blue Oval over Campground I was attending an outdoor festival (at the Brushwood Folklore Center)in an area so rural that the Amish live nearby. The sky was clear, stars shining, etc. and the mood was upbeat. I (sober) first saw something seem to rise in the distant North horizon. A circle-shaped ball of amber light was directly below it, but flickered out after about four seconds. I called out to anyone who would look- a light blue oval was shooting across on an exactly straight path overhead. No one could ID it, elongated and about the size of a dime held at arm's length. It went, still glowing into the Southern horizon and not making sounds, although there was a sound system in the area. This is my second sighting it wasn't as shocking this time... I'm still angry about not being told a straight story.;42.1618;-79.5797
