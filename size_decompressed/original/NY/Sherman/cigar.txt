Chrome appearance slow moving;2002-07-04 15:00:00;45 seconds;Chrome appearance slow moving The craft sighted was a featureless cigar-shaped design. The hull had the appearance of very smooth polished chrome. It was flying low and far too slowly- silent, no engine noise whatsoever. This was viewed by two witnesses at Brushwood Folklore Center looking to the North in the distance. The witnesses looked away from the craft for a moment of conversation, then found the craft had completely left the area. Event duration was about 45 seconds. Within the next 48 hours, another camper insisted on having seen a blue oval craft there. I believe him- having seen one myself there the year before. Connection?;42.1618;-79.5797
