Something I've never in my life seen before.;2021-02-03 00:30:00;5-6 minutes;Something I've never in my life seen before. I was smoking a cigarette at about 12:30 at night.  As a was finishing I noticed a large aircraft in the sky.  It was very big and almost a complete circle.  It stood in the exact same place for about 10 minutes.  There was an red/organe light circling around it the entire time.  It appeared to stay exactly where it was over lake Seneca not moving an inch as the stars around it did.  I got a very good look at it and I have never seen anything like it before.  And after about 10 minutes it just completely disappeared in what looked like a flash of lightning . It was below the clouds so it couldn't of been a satellite or star.there was also what look to be smaller aircraft around it just circling  Tthese aircraft acted just like the big one just floating and resting emiting a similar light;42.8608000000001;-76.9915000000001
