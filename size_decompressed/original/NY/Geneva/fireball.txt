Red light flying large circles in the sky.;2014-06-20 22:20:00;30 minutes;Red light flying large circles in the sky. We were camping by the Seneca Lake in Sampson State Park south of Geneva, NY. Campground is an old large military base. Red light (much larger than any star) appeared in the northern horizon (above the tree line). It was moving closer toward us.  There was NO sound!  It came close to being overhead and started turning toward West. As it turned, the large red light slowly disappeared, making it apparent that it was only pointing forward from the object.  The object seemed to be on a circular path. In about ten minutes the same object appeared in the same spot in the sky and flying the same path as the first time only this time staying little further North.  This happened two more times.  This red light was never blinking or changing in any way except for the disappearance.  To all of us watching it seemed that the object was moving in a slightly fluctuating speed although keeping a steady path.  The overall speed was that of a helicopter. It was a clear night and the camp was a quiet place, yet none of us could hear any sound.;42.8608000000001;-76.9915000000001
Fireball over State Highway 318 NY.;2014-07-19 21:30:00;2 minutes;Fireball over state highway 318 NY. I was driving my buddy home last night and we were traveling on state rt. 318 heading eastward.  We happened to look up in the sky ahead of the car and we noticed what looked like an airplane on fire.   As we drew closer to it, it appeared to be an orange glowing ball.   I slowed down to about 20 mph and neither of us heard anything other than my car's engine and the sound of the tires on the road.  It just seemed to hover over that spot and was about 200-300 yards up from the ground, which would've made it a very low-flying plane.   No noise, no exhaust could be seen or heard.  My buddy continued to look out the windows as we passed it.  He explained to me that it looked like it was following us.   He no sooner got that out of his mouth and then said that it had grown dim and then suddenly, it flashed out like a light switch.   There were other cars on the road at the time, so I imagine others had to have seen this too!;42.8608000000001;-76.9915000000001
