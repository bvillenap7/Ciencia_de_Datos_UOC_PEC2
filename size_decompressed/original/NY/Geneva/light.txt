Light / Star - faint at first.  Increasing in brightness, with red / purple strobe light, appearing and disappearing;2008-06-09 01:30:00;2 hours;Light / Star - faint at first.  Increasing in brightness, with red / purple strobe light, appearing and disappearing I was on lunch break during the night shift when a friend pointed a light in the west/north sky that resembled a star. He said he noticed it about half a month ago, in the same spot in the sky.  He also said several people in the city have been talking about it.  Looking toward the sky, I saw a faint star that became brighter until it was a very bright white light above the horizon, but not as high to be a plane. The size seemed to increase, but that may only be because the brightest increased.  The the light disappeared.  Within the half hour, the light continued to appear and disappear several times. On its reappearance, it was accompanied by a red light that appeared to be revolving around the white light. And there also appeared to be a purple-ish light. It was like stobe lights.  When we went outside again for break, two hour later, the lights could be seen again, white bright and reddish and purple, appearing and disappearing.  The location of the lights moved slightly more north in the sky.  Later this date at 23:30 est, I checked the sky and saw only the bright white light.  It appeared in the same location of the sky, west/north.  This time it was only the bright white light, faint at first sight, and increasing in brightness, and then disappearing.;42.8608000000001;-76.9915000000001
