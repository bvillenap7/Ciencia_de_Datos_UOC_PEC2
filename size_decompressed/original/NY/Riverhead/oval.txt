Ufo sighting over riverhead round purple, orange color here for 20 -seconds & gone. The first thing i noticed was a perfict shaped cloud eluminated, than it faded away.   Then just to the left of that a disk appeared, it was purple, with some shades of orange and slight yellow on the left side.  After about 12 seconds, it disappeared, leaving a round shaped cloud where it was that faded away.   Seconds later much further up in the sky i saw two, what apeard to be shooting stars with tails go in the south east direction away from the rising sun.
