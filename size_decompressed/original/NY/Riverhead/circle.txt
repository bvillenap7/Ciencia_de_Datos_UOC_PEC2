A very fast flying object on Digital camera video clip;2007-05-05 13:30:00;10 seconds;A very fast flying object on Digital camera video clip I was at a bike fest in riverhead and taking footage of the stunts, when I got home and was watching the footage from my digital camera I noticed a object in the sky in the backround of one of the clips, It moves very fast and is circular shaped. It is a very compelling clip for myself, i have allways belived in UFO's but not fully until now . I have reviewed the clip many times and it is in NO way shape or form a Airplane , Bird , Ballon , or anythging else you could possible try to call it! I would like some information on who to get this clip out to without having trouble and I would also like to make some money off it. I am being very honest and this is something I take very seriously and never thought would happen to me;40.9271;-72.6509

I looked up and saw a large bright round light just sitting in the sky.  It just sat there for a few seconds then very quickly drove off into the sky and disappeared out of sight. It moved incredibly fast!! Like nothing I have ever seen.;40.9271;-72.6509
small silver/white light , making rapid zig-zag patterns in early morning sky;2010-02-08 05:40:00;2 minutes or less;small silver/white light , making rapid zig-zag patterns in early morning sky I looked up at the sky this morning at 5:40, looking north, and I saw what I thought was a satellite- small whitish/silver circle, like a star.  Instead of taking a steady path like a satellite, this whitish circle began to make irregular patterns very quickly.  It almost looked like a white/silver balloon that was getting caught up in the wind and was blowing from random gusts of wind.  It remained the same color and brightness, but would zig zag, then seem to stop, then repeat the irregular rapid movement.  I watched it for approximately two minutes until I lost it to the north west.;40.9271;-72.6509
