3 Giant Fireballs over Easter Long Island! UFO Sighting 09/04/2013;2013-08-04 00:10:00;5-8 minutes;3 Giant Fireballs over Easter Long Island! UFO Sighting 09/04/2013 My cousin and I were coming from Mc Donals on Flanders Rd in Riverhead headed east when up to the north east we could see 3 Giant, pulsating, fireballs!   Upon driving further down the road where we could get a good look at them we stopped the car and there we could see three distinct fireballs glowing bright yellowish-orange and moving at very high speeds!   We tried to take a picture but by the time I got my phone out they had moved far beyond the cameras line of veiw!   I am a 23 year old man and I was born and raised here in the town of Riverhead! I have never seen anything like this before and I have no reason to make any of this up!   We really feel as though we saw something remarkable and just wanted it to be in someway documented!;40.9271;-72.6509
Circular green object entering our atmosphere turned into light storm of energy.???? ((NUFORC Note:  Meteor???  PD));2016-05-16 00:45:00;5 seconds;Circular green object entering our atmosphere turned into light storm of energy.???? My work crew of three and I had just pulled into our hotel, when we saw what looked to be a round green object racing towards earth.  At about 20' from the horizon at my vantage point it had a green fireball around it,  I would estimate it to be within five miles of my location easy.  From my vantage point it looked to be as big as a house and at about 5' from the horizon it lit the whole sky lit up with light.   Then a kind of trace of lightning looking light coming into it not away from it.  If it had been a meteor or something else, there isn't a doubt in my mind we would have heard it impact earth.  It seemed to have just stopped.  It was like it had an intelligence about it not just some dumb rock entering our atmosphere.  The night tonight is clear and the background is solid black.  It was just one very large object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.9271;-72.6509
