Phoenix Lights on Long Island;2002-07-16 22:00:00;50 minutes;Phoenix Lights on Long Island I was driving West on Route 48 from Orient Long Island. As I got to Southold I saw a very bright yellowish light in the air. I drove towards it for 45 minutes and it did not change direction, when I came to a clearing off to my rightside which is where the Long Island Sound is I saw a smaller bright Cobalt Blue light closer to the ground moving east. I noticed 2 (military) jets flying close by the Bright yellow light. I lost sight of the blue one because I was driving. After another 20 minutes I got out of my car and the light was still there, same height and did not moving. I then had to get onto the Long Island Expressway where I lost sight of the craft.;40.9271;-72.6509
