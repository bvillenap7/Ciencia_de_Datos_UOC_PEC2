UFO Spotted in Riverhead NY 01/16/08;2008-01-16 11:30:00;2 minutes;UFO Spotted in Riverhead NY 01/16/08 On January 16, 2008 at approximately 1130 hours, I was traveling Southbound on Route 105 in Riverhead toward Westhampton, NY. The sky was clear and it was sunny. I was looking forward when a very large object caught my eye in the sky. It appeared to move very quickly and it was much larger than any aircraft that I have ever seen. It was totally quiet, and although the sky was clear and the object was flying low, it appeared and disappeared from site several times. I watched it move very quickly Westbound toward New York City. There was a white streak that appeared and disappeared with the object. When I saw the object, I immediately called my brother and asked him to check the news for “breaking news” that someone else may have seen this object.  I did not want to report the object for fear of embarrassment, however, when I watched the evening news tonight, I now know that other people have sighted the same type of object in other parts of the country.;40.9271;-72.6509
