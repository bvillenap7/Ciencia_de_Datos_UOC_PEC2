Huge V shaped object with yellow lights and no sound surrounded by a hazy fog;2009-03-15 22:15:00;1 minute;Huge V shaped object with yellow lights and no sound surrounded by a hazy fog My wife and I were standing on the deck of our house approximately 10:15-10:20 PM on March 15, 2009.   It was a very clear night and we saw a smoky haze in the north sky coming toward us.  There was not a cloud in the sky, bright stars and no wind.   As it got closer we saw a V shape with 5 yellow lights on each side.  It was huge and it did not make a sound.  There were no flashing or blinking lights as there are on a plane.  This was too large to be a plane and it did not make a sound.   As far as we know, no one else in our area saw this object.;40.9271;-72.6509
