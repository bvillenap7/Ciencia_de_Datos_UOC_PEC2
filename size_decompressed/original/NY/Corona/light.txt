Strange moving and color changing lights in the sky and strange flying object;2016-04-13 21:00:00;15 minutes +;strange moving and color changing lights in the sky and strange flying object me and a few friends were hanging out and for some strange reason i decided to look up and i noticed a strange alignment of lights some were shifting very slightly left to right (you really had to focus to notice movement) about 3 of those lights looked as if they were changing color from white to redish orange then slightly blue, then shortly after we saw 2 different aircrafts, the first was strange it was definately not a plane or helicopter and its was shooting straight up and at a fast rate (approximately 4x faster than a regualar plane and it left a light trail of white smoke ) then shortly after approximately 5 min after we saw a different aircraft  wich looked more familiar than the first aircraft. The second looked like a helicopter of some sort and it was in the same area without movement for about 3 min then started flying away regularly (it was as if it was looking for the strange ufo me and my friends saw ) DEFFINATELY NOT NORMAL! usually dont see too many stars in nyc if you live here you know what i mean but last night the sky seemed to be lit up with them i will be observing again tonight and if anything is seen will deffinately record and post it up;40.7484;-73.862
