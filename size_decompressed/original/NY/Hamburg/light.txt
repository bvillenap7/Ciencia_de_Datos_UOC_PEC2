2 bright white lights, one  follow ing the other, seen in night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD));2009-09-08 21:20:00;1 minute;Two bright white lights, one  following the other, seen in night sky for about a minute. Two bright white lights (at least as bright as Venus) were noted immediately in the north sky, over his house, by the first witness when he went out to walk the dog. Initially the bright lights were the same size and brightness. One light followed the other in a fairly straight line to the right.  The first witness called his wife outside and she saw the two bright lights, one still following the other to the right. By the time the second witness saw the lights, the left light, following the other one, had faded in brightness, but the leading light was still bright.  The left light faded away gradually, then the right light, still bright, faded away fairly suddenly.  The first witness said that the entire episode lasted 45 seconds to one minute. The second witness saw the final fifteen to twenty seconds of  the episode. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD));42.7368;-78.8358000000005
A pale green light with short white tail crossed over I-`90 going north.;2012-05-05 21:30:00;30 seconds;A pale green light with short white tail crossed over I-90 going north . This happened on June 5th, 2012, at about 9:30pm, I was heading West on Interstate 90 around Hamburg ,NY.  It  appeared all of a sudden and at first I thought it was a shooting star but then noticed it was moving too slow and was pale green.  It only lasted about 30 seconds maybe less and vanished.  The pale green light had a short white tail and crossed over the thruway from South to North.  Other drivers may have seen it as there were many on the road at the time.;42.7368;-78.8358000000005
