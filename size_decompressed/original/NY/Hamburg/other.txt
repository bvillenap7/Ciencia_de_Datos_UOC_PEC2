I looked out the window and I saw a flashing object that I thought was a plane, but it remained stationary for more than 5 minutes.  I went to the other room and got my digital binocular camera, took pictures and downloaded them to my computer.  It was a v shaped object with multiple colored lights.  It remained stationary for about 20 minutes, then disappear.  It just stopped blinking and disappeared.;42.7368;-78.8358000000005

My daughter and I sat down at Applebees in Hamburg when we both seen looking outside the window over the parking lot a large muffen shaped craft about 20 feet above the parking lot.  The bottom of the craft opened and it look liked a bowl upside down.  It had a slow counterclockwise spin.  The bottom of the craft was grooved with white lights between each groove.  It moved back and forth over the parking lot that was full of cars.  It darted back and forth as it ascended upwards. I would call it a darting movement that was hard to watch as it moved. It was about 100 feet across and 50 feet tall. It then stopped again for a few seconds and came closer towards us and then darted over Applebees where we could not see it any longer. It was seen about 500 feet from us to about 200 feet when it moved over Applebees.  There were people in the parkin lot looking up. I do not wish to give contact information for safety.
