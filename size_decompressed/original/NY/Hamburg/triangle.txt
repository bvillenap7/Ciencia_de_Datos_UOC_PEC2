Triangular UFO sends probes into Lake Erie;1980-07-14 23:00:00;3 hours;Triangular UFO sends probes into Lake Erie My friend and I observed a triangular craft flying over the eastern end of Lake Erie near Buffalo, NY for several evenings during the summer of 1980. On the last night we observed it little probes came out of the bottom of the craft and under the surface of the lake. They flew underwater in all directions, going up to the craft, and back down to the water again. I was never so scared in all my life! We even went to another beach a mile away and observed them there as well. My friend was more daring than me so she went for a closer look at the probes. She stated there were little creatures inside controling them! I had friends who reported UFOs over Lake Erie to me before so after this I believed them...

Huge triangle craft over Lake Erie.;2018-10-09 20:12:00;~5 minutes;Huge triangle craft over Lake Erie. A friend arrived to drop off some donations to add to what was already in my truck so I could drop them off, while loading the items, I caught an odd reflection in the trucks side mirror that prompted me to look up, I observed a stationary triangle in the sky about 45 degrees from the horizon in a westerly direction from where we were standing, I told my friend to look at it as I retrieved my binoculars from the truck, we both got a good look at it and observed red, orange, blue and green lights that flashed around the perimeter of the craft, from where we were standing I would estimate it was over Lake Erie and about three times the size of jet aircraft I regularly see on approach to Buffalo airport but outside of their approach paths.  As we were looking at it and debating as to getting out my telescope,it started to glow orange and disappeared from sight, I believe it just shot straight up but it happened in less than a blink of an eye.   We cannot be the only ones that saw this thing as it was a beautiful warm clear night, especially for October.;42.7368;-78.8358000000005
