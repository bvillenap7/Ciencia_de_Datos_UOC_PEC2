Observed bright white sphere hovering over vehicle;1980-06-01 19:00:00;:10;Observed bright white sphere hovering over vehicle I was 17 and riding in the car with my parents. They were driving me to an extracurricular evening activity. While going down Route 5 we observed a huge bright white sphere that appeared to hover silently in front of our vehicle. It appeared to be very, very close.  I remebered being very frightened. The light vanished as suddenly as it appeared. When we arrived at our destination (Nike base in Hamburg, NY) another person attending the activity had witnessed this spherical ball also. We looked out of a window facing Northeast and saw the light again... it was moving erractically and then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Bright light drops from the sky and crosses over the Thruway in Hamburg, NY.;2012-02-06 06:40:00;15 seconds;Bright light drops from the sky and crosses over the Thruway in Hamburg, NY. While driving to work in the morning at approximately 6:40 AM on 02/06/12 on the NYS Thruway (eastbound) just west of exit 56, I noticed a bright white light off to my left side (west over Lake Erie).  The light appeared to be very fast moving and also appeared to be dropping down in altitude.  I assumed it was an aircraft headed for Buffalo-Niagara Intl Airport.  However, I then realized that it was moving too fast and in a more easterly direction and could not be headed for the airport.  It appeared to be headed for the ground in the near vacinity. It passed directly in front of me as I was passing the Home Depot which is off to the right side when eastbound on the Thruway.  It was an extremely bright light and made no sound that I heard. I watched it pass by and go off toward the McKinley Mall.  It appeared to pass over the mall and disappeared from sight. I assumed that it must have been a meteor, but I can not confirm that. Maybe something else????;42.7368;-78.8358000000005
An unusual Christmas Day present!;2019-12-25 14:35:00;5 seconds;An unusual Christmas Day present! I looked out my back door window on a sunny day to watch a bird on my porch and I saw a bright, shiny ball of light rising up in the sky above the trees.  I didn't know what it was and continued to watch it make a sharp left turn, then it made a sharp right turn, like a zigzag, and then it shot straight up into the sky and disappeared!;42.7368;-78.8358000000005

We then noticed other spherical objects forming in a triangular formation behind the illuminated object. These other spheres were not illuminated but had a shiny aluminum appearance. In total, we were witnessing 12-15 objects all flying quickly and silently in an organized formation. Suddenly the non-illuminated objects became bright with white light just like the first sphere leading the pack. The objects flew above us at low altitude, certainly in our atmosphere/airspace. The objects moved faster than anything I have ever seen before.  After about 30 seconds, the objects turned off their lights and disappeared.  No silhouette or any trace of them. The night sky was very clear- 10% cloud cover.  We watched numerous planes, satellites, shooting stars, etc.  These unidentified objects were very eye catching and hard to ignore. Cert!ainly an aircraft of some sort.;42.7368;-78.8358000000005
