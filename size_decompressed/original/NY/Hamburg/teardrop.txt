Orange glowing orb with 2 beings in craft low flightpath 40-60 feet above me.;1970-04-17 19:00:00;5 minutes;orange glowing orb with 2 beings in craft low flightpath 40-60 feet above me I was 11 years old at the time and while I have reported this before, I feel it deserves more attention. It was in April 1970 and I was 11 at the time.  It was a warm clear spring night, time was around 19:00. I lived in Hamburg, NY, a suburb of Buffalo, NY. I was outside, shooting baskets at the hoop mounted to our garage (10ft).  Facing the basket to my right stood a cherry tree approximately 12-15 feet tall.  Our property in the back was 250 feet from the street behind us.  That street was lined with Maple trees, approximately 40-60 ft. tall. I was shooting basketball, as I stated earlier, when I noticed an orange colored light in the distance above the tree line.  The houses on my street were pretty much out in front allowing a backyards view of anything in the sky. I thought, “That’s not a plane or a helicopter, it’s too low.”  The dot I was observing was about a ¼ inch big and about a mile away.  It was now I could see it was getting larger and still no noise was heard.  I then thought “it’s not a plane, or a helicopter, I don’t hear anything. Within seconds It got to be about 3” ball of orange light and I could tell it was just above the tree line.  Now within a half mile it became obvious it was a UFO.  Within seconds the ball of light was almost above me and was approximately 30ft wide.  My jaw dropped as it came apparent as it was within 500 feet that two individuals were in the craft, they were silhouetted by the cabin orange glow of the craft.  Both were humanoid, one was sitting down and the other standing up.  The heads were bulbish as in wearing helmets and not the grey type heads as reported today. I yelled to my sister to come out of the garage but as in this took place a couple seconds it was gone.  I could not view it after about 200 feet past me as a house and trees on the corner blocked me.;42.7368;-78.8358000000005
