GLOWING OBJECT HOVERING ABOVE THE TREELINE AND HOUSES;1992-04-24 04:30:00;minutes;GLOWING OBJECT HOVERING ABOVE THE TREELINE AND HOUSES I AWOKE AT 4:30 AM AND LOOKED OUT MY UPSTAIRS WINDOW AND SAW AN UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT THAT WAS JUST ABOVE THE TREE TOPS.  IT WAS A GLOWING LUMINESCENT THAT WAS SAUCER SHAPE AND HAD A DOME.   I WENT TO CHECK ON MY SON IN ANOTHER ROOM AND THEN CAME BACK TO THE WINDOW WHERE I HAD INITIALLY HAD SEEN THE UFO, AND IT WAS GONE. IT HAD NOT OCCURED TO ME AT FIRST THAT IT WAS A UFO BECAUSE IT WAS RIGHT ABOVE THE TREE TOPS.   I'VE BEEN A STAR TREK FAN FOR YEARS BUT NEVER ACTUALLY BELIEVED IN UFO'S UNTIL I SAW THIS ONE IN THE LATTER PART OF APRIL, 1992. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

It was there for about 1 minute, it was just hovering over my neighborhood.  Then, it started going in space two minutes later.  It was curved on the top, and the bottom was flat.  It was silent, and big. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness is anonymous.  PD));42.7368;-78.8358000000005
UFO seen over Hamburg NY 5/30/2015 at 9:10pm;2015-05-30 21:00:00;5 minutes;UFO seen over Hamburg NY 5/30/2015 at 9:10pm Large black saucer shaped object moving very slow from north to slow, flying extremely slow.  Silent and flying very low.  Smooth could see no distinctive features.  White streaks were seen in a straight line coming out the side of the craft.  The craft followed the direction of the streaks.  Was traveling from west to east and about the time it was to the treeline from my view it turned south.  It almost appeared to be a very large balloon by the way it was traveling.  Smaller than a blimp but much larger than a hot air balloon. Realized it wasn't a balloon when it emitted what looked like a white streak from its side and moved in the direction of the streaks projection.  If it was a type of thruster it should have went the opposite direction of the streak but it precisely turned and followed the direction of the streak almost instantly.  We have never seen anything like in our lives and I am very skeptical of the ufo topic.  I have no Idea what this craft could have ! been and I'm still in amazement as to what we saw.  Hoping others have seen it and maybe took video.  Would love to see this on the local news and get some kind of explanation as to what it was or if its truly something unknown.
