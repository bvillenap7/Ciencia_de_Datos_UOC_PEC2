Me,my friend,and his sister were walking back to his tent in his backyard when I noticed a bright ball of light nearly 200 meters away and about 50 meters in diameter. The sphere  changed colors every few seconds from white,to blue,to red. It was defintly higher than the tops of the trees. We didn't think to much of it and went to sleep. It wasn't untill moring I began to belive I saw something extraordinary. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact infomration.  PD));42.7368;-78.8358000000005
