Sat down to eat dinner with my family, and noticed, my daughter and I, started watching a huge bun shaped object hovering over the parking lot.  The place was packed with people and the parking lot full of cars. I have to say this was strange for day light hours with so many other people around.   I was not looking for anything like this but watched it in amazement and to see it up close within 200 feet. It went from a shiny metallic when it first came down just feet away from the cars parked in the lot... to all black when it started to shifting back and forth over the parking lot at an incredible rate of speed... it started spinning and had white lights along the base between each of the crease on the bottom.  It traveled so fast that it seemed to morph or stretch when it moved.   I really jumped and stud up when I first seen it when it started to dash back and forth over the parking lot.  Would have been hard to see if your eyes were not already fixed on it.  My daughter said it was a flying bowl and she said that this object did not want to be seen because of how it darted back and forth.  It finally darted over us were we were sitting out of sight.  It was a couple of weeks ago..  I think it is weird and my 13 year old daughter is not afraid, and said it was just space people?   My feeling is that whatever I seen is still there... top of the buildings. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.7368;-78.8358000000005
