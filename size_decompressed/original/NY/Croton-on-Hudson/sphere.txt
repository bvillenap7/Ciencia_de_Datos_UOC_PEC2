Seemed to be just above tree line but it was huge so hard to tell how high. Silent. Slow. Many saw it. Police cars followed. was dark saw perimeter lights only. Truly Phenominal. There was commotion outside. I was at my boyfriends house I went out and Saw what everyone was looking at (Many people on the street were standing infront of their houses looking up) this craft was huge it had lights all around the perimeter Like a floating football field. And it made no sound.  It seemed to be following the street...which was a dead end so the police cars which came wizzing along had to turn around and go back the way they came when it glided on past.  There was talk about the sighting for a breif time but excuses were made that some jokers from west point were flying in formation. Also A blimp was mentioned I believe.  I know it was not the airforce flying in formation, Because the lights were all connected. I could tell this because the distance between them remained fixed. Also what I saw was very low and made no sound. I am skeptical about the blimp explaination because It was not confirmed that there was infact a blimp hovering around after dark at that time...I would hope the police would know of such an event. But they didn't.  This was a long time ago but I recently saw a similar craft cought on video on T.V. Also some I witness accounts were Familiar From the lights to the slow speed to the lack of sound.  And this account came from a police officer I was hoping it was the same sighting I was wittness to but it wasn't. I have heard nothing else about the event.  I looked online to try and find some record. I thougt that maybe someone else would corroborate the event for me but I see no listings For Croton - On - Hudson.;41.2182;-73.8911
