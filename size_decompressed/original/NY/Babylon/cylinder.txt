Object of bright light over Long Island NY coast.  ((anonymous report));2019-03-23 21:45:00;5 minutes;Object of bright light over Long Island NY coast Out my window in the distance, I observed a very bright white light with no defined shape moving low and very slowly, almost hovering, I was looking for the northern lights tonight that may be seen in NY, a rare occurrence.   At first I thought this white light was part of it but quickly understood that it wasnâ€™t.  It was dark and in comparison to a plane in the sky at the same time with flashing lights I determined after a few moments that this was not a plane and I could not understand what it was.  We live off the coast by the water and in a busy flight path, so I am familiar with seeing planes. After taking my eye off of it for a second, I looked again and noticed that the object turned right and was going in the opposite direction.  It was quite a distance away, but it looked circular/slightly oval, black with a bright white light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
