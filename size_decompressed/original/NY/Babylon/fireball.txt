I witnessed a sphere shaped object while looking west traveling from southeast to northwest in a straight path. The object was 3/4 the size of a full moon estimated at 20 thousand miles up. The object was extremely bright and glowed with a light blue hue at the center and surrounded by bright yellow which left a trail of bright white. The object seemed big and very low to the surface of the earth. It seemed to travel slow for something that appeared to be pretty low. This was very similar to Halley's Comet. Which I remember viewing it for 3 to 5 minutes across the sky. This was very similar but only lasted 3 to 5 seconds.

Red pulsating object visualized by my wife and I over Babylon NY, moving due South and abruptly disappearing..;2012-07-01 22:30:00;1 minute;Red pulsating object visualized by my wife and I over Babylon NY, moving due South and abruptly disappearing.. I was watching television with my wife at approximately 22:30hrs, when I noticed a pulsating light in the sky from my window.  This amorphous light was moving due South.  Its altitude was approximately 3000-5000 feet. I asked my wife to look at it, and she thought it looked like an aircraft on fire.  We turned out the lights, and then went to our porch outside our bedroom to follow it.  There was no sound coming from the object. It continued in a straight line from North to South and then spontaneously disappeared.  There was no further sighting after that.  This event lasted approximately 1 minute. Having some flight experience, I found it odd that there was no sound for an object that was at such a low altitude.  The light emitted by this craft was red, and slightly pulsating.   I was unable to ascertain any specific shape to the craft, but it was small.  There was no cloud cover to account for the immediate disappearance of the craft.  It did not change altitude during our sighting. It was not seen again after that.;40.6973;-73.3271

At approximately 10:30 p.m. ET, on the South Shore of Long Island in Suffolk County, NY, my husband abruptly said, What is that?  What is that? We ran to the window and saw an unusual flying object.     At around 3 or 5 thousand feet, a flying object was heading southbound.  It had a brilliant, twinkling, deep orange light.  It appeared to be about the same size as an airplane.  It actually looked like a commercial airplane on fire. We opened the porch door  to listen for any sound emanating from the object.  There was none. It was in our view for about 1 minute.  Then it disappeared.;40.6973;-73.3271
