At approx. 23:20 on the evening of July the 6th, 2000, My girlfreind and I were out on a walk to enjoy the night air. We walked around the block she lives on (It's large, about a 1/2 mile walk ), and came to rest on an adjacent street corner. All night we had been amazed at how clear the sky was, noting the usually hazy horizon. It was uncommonly clear on this night. We saw three lights, star-like in appearance, flying northeast at 12 0'clock high. They appeared to be in a formation, with the leader forming the peak of an arrowhead. the wingmen never really faultered, but seemed more in unison with the leader's sways and dips. It continued ( at which my girl and I both concluded) must have been an incredible rate of speed, before each one slowed down seperatly and faded off, one by one into space.;40.6973;-73.3271
