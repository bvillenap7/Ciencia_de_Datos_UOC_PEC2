My house is very high and so it is a natural thing to look at the stars as that is all you can see from the second level.  I immediately said to myself, wow, a shooting star.  How lucky to be up for five minutes and see on.  Upon further inspection, it never continued to fall.  It just kept going around and around and from my vantage poine, I could make out at least a red and white light going around the center.  I stayed there for some time trying to figure out just what I saw when I realized that I could make out three stationary objects forming a sort of triangle around the moving object.  I left the room, came back and refocused.  I even called my husband who saw the object but didn't have his glasses on to confirm my beliefs.  I compared this 'object' with everything else in the sky and NOTHING else was moving except this.  After about 15 minutes, I went to bed.  I rewoke two hours later, and it was gone, however, ALL OF THE OTHER STARS WERE STILL OUT THERE.;40.6973;-73.3271
