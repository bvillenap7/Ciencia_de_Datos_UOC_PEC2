Pulsating light/saucer seen darting over Cedar Beach, Babylon, NY;2010-09-06 04:30:00;20 minutes;Pulsating light/saucer seen darting over Cedar Beach, Babylon, NY This case has a total of two witnesses. We were parked on the south side of Ocean Parkway, half a mile west of the entrance to Cedar Beach. No lights on the highway made for outstanding sky visibility, so we were stargazing for a while.  I saw a regular shooting star that lasted half a second, with a standard quick tail streak, directly north, at a good 80 to 90 degrees above the horizon. Then, about five minutes later, at 60-degrees upward from the horizon, and directly northeast, a pulsating light approximately the width of 1/10th the moon, very bright / white - began traveling in a southeast direction in the sky, maintaining altitude.  The light was definitely not relative to standard aircraft lights including helicopters.  It was pulsating every two or three seconds, switching on, then dimming itself off.  This effect lasted approximately two minutes. At about five minutes later, we both saw what we first suspected was going to be a shooting star  - except, it had no tail streak at all, and it lasted for far too long, and seemed to slow down gradually as it finished.  It lasted about three or four seconds.  The object zipping across the sky was saucer shaped, in a way.  There was a red/beige tint to the object, and it appeared to have an outer circle, and a more solid inner circle.  Object was at most – a fifth the diameter of the moon (outer circle), but gradually dimmed into nothingness.  It’s also suspicious because the beginning of the path of this object happened to intersect with the trajectory of the original pulsating UFO’s path. Five minutes after this effect, that same pulsating light began moving in a western direction, from exactly the same spot that saucer-like shooting star dropped in the sky. This lasted a few more minutes until it dimmed out beyond our visibility.;40.6973;-73.3271
