Seven points of light continuously changing position with each other, yet all moving in the same direction.;2002-04-20 22:00:00;15 seconds;Seven points of light continuously changing position with each other, yet all moving in the same direction. My 14 year old son and I were out walking our dog when he suddenly stated, Wow.  What's that!  I noticed he was looking up into the sky.  I looked up also and saw approximately seven points of light moving from south to north.  We were facing toward the east.  The points of light, as I call them, were red in color and did not blink.  Although clearly visible, they did appear to be quite distant.  As compared to a satellite visible at night, these lights (as a whole group) moved somewhat faster and were easier to see (brighter although not as bright as airplane lights).  These points of light were moving together as a group, however the distance between each one was constantly changing.  There was no set formation.  One light would move forward, another would move back.  One would move from one side and another to the other side.  They did not move one at a time either.  Two or three would be displaying this characteristic at the same time.  I was not able to determine any rhythmic pattern to their movement.  Generally, they were all travelling to the north, however each seemed to have a mind of it's own by switching places with another.  This continued for approximatley 15 seconds until we lost sight them.  Weather conditions were not a factor as it was a clear night.;42.5941999999996;-76.1880999999996
20+ fast moving objects in the span of about an hour, upstate NY, 7/2/04;2004-07-02 22:00:00;1 hour;20+ fast moving objects in the span of about an hour, upstate NY, 7/2/04 The objects we (mother, two teenaged sons) saw were going from an east to west direction, going at a very fast speed, way more than the average commercial airliner.  They had blinking lights, most of which were 3, white, and circular, and then a red one came on and off, in a diamond pattern(three whites in the front, and red in the back).  There were also 2 constant white lights at the back of the aircraft.  We observed as many as 20-25 of these over the course of about an hour. Very clear night, full moon, all very visible.  They would usually go in parallel lines from east to west, normally in pairs of some distance apart.  One was seen going straight up out of the west sky, rather than toward us and overhead.  It did this at a very rapid speed, more than the others going from west to east. We were under the impression we were possibly watching military aircrafts until we saw the one going in a totally unpredicatable pattern.  No sounds were heard.;42.5941999999996;-76.1880999999996
