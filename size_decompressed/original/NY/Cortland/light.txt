Light faded away and reappered in different location several times.;2005-11-11 18:00:00;15 mins;Light faded away and reappered in different location several times. Driving on Rt. 81 North, I was looking out my window towards the city of Cortland.  I noticed an unusally bright white light in the sky.  I watched it for about 30 seconds, then it faded away.  It all of a sudden reappered in a different location in the sky.  It faded away again after about 10-15 seconds, and reappered in a different location again.  I watched this for about 15 mins and could still see it in my rear view mirror while driving.;42.5941999999996;-76.1880999999996
