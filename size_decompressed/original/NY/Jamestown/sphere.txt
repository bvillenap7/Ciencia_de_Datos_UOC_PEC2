I was in my parent house on Moon Rd., Woke up in the middle of the night.  Looked out the window. saw a SMALL round object at max three feet.  up in the pine trees.  houvering.  Asked a friend sleeping over to look.  She was scared.  watched it.  It moved a bit.  Ran down and woke up parents. By then it was gone.  Never reported because it was so small (didn't ever hear of SMALL ones.  It had light all around it.  It appeared to make no sound.  Just saw one.  Probably not usable since it was so long ago and no witnesses. I have a Masters in Admin of Law.  Worked as a cop for six years. Now teach high school.  Was riding around with a sheriff (you cannot use this) from the next county five years ago and asked if they ever has UFO sightings.  He said there were some in the 70's and a couple of officers reported them.  They were flown down to Washington. And when they  came back they reported NOTHING.  My ex partner who worked for a time in West Ellicott, NY, went up to a golf course after reports and found a scorched part.  There was a pond nearby and all the fish were floating on top.;42.0930000000004;-79.2439999999995
