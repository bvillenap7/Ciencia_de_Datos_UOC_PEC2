horizontal ovular formation of white lights rippling through clouds;2004-12-03 21:00:00;1 hour;horizontal ovular formation of white lights rippling through clouds This is hard to describe.  It appears in the clouds as a horizontal oval formation of many circular lights that rotate around in the shape of this oval in a direction opposite the motion of the entire formation.  For example, when the formation moves from left to right, the circular white lights rotate in a counterclockwise direction.  This repeats from left to right... dissapears....right to left....dissapears...left to right and so on for the duration of around 1hour.  It was first seen by a coworker who pointed it out and showed it to others.;42.0930000000004;-79.2439999999995
