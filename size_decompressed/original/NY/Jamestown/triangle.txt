A black triangle with solid red lights along the leading two edges.;2006-04-13 22:00:00;15 seconds;A black triangle with solid red lights along the leading two edges. I was lying in a field at about 10: 00 PM on April 13th 2006.  There was a thin covering of clouds and a full moon.   As I was looking upwards some movement in the sky caught and drew my eye.  It was a black triangle below the cloud level gliding along absolutely silently.  It was in the form of an isosceles triangle with red lights along the leading two edges.   They didn't blink and what struck me as strange was that there was no green light like on a conventional aircraft and the odd formation they were in.  It glided overhead and I kept it in view for about 15 seconds.    This is the formation    * *   * *       * *           * ((NUFORC Note:  Shape of formation did not survive transfer to database.
