A bright, large, light that had an orange haze around its perimeter appeared in the northern sky.  It was flying slowing at an altitude of approx. three to four thousand feet.  From a distance, it appeared to have a few tiny sparks shooting out from the bottom.  The sparks disappeared as the object got closer.   It had no other lights of any kind that would identify it as a conventional aircraft.  I did hear the faint sound of an airplane that was flying at a much higher altitude in the distance.   This bright light that looked like a large star with orange around it flew past me and slowly ascended until it it completely disappeared.   Just as I was trying to process what I had just seen, another bright light identical to the first one flew by me, repeating the same pattern.;42.0930000000004;-79.2439999999995
