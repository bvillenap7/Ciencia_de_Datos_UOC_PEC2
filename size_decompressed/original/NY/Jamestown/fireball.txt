Might have discharged very small sparks. It was about 10:50pm EST. My wife and I were walking outside to her car, as she had to go to work and I was seeing her off.  I looked to the west and saw a yellow-orange light in the west, heading east, coming towards us.  At first I thought it was an aircraft, possibly a helicopter, as there is a trauma flight helo pad a couple blocks away and it was moving at a slow rate of speed.  But there was no noise. I then pointed it out to my wife.  Then we both thought it might be meteor, as is did seem to be flaming and shedding very small sparks.  The sparks were few and very small, coming both from the rear of the object, as well as the sides toward the rear. But the sky is overcast (rained all day) and the object was below the cloud cover. The object wasn’t perfectly round, nor oval, nor did it have a long tail. It did seem to have almost a “bullet with wings” shape, as it passed more sidelong to us, like the flame was forming some kind of small “wings”.  They weren’t wings, but the flame, the closer it got, spread out in a short winged shape  The object seemed to curve to the NE. It appeared to be a deep orange as it went out of sight to the northeast. I did run to grab my camera and have it on video, though not sure of the quality.;42.0930000000004;-79.2439999999995
