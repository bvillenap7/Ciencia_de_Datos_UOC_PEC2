A row of porthole shaped lights hovering at an altitude of approx. 500 feet spanning a distance of about 1 mile.;1990-10-01 22:15:00;20 minutes;A row of porthole shaped lights hovering at an altitude of approx. 500 feet spanning a distance of about 1 mile. I saw what Arizona Gov. Fife Symington wintessed, otherwise known as the Phoenix Lights.  It was a row of circular, porthole shaped lights in a perfect, symetrical straight line. The porthole-shaped lights were equal-distant apart. The entire row of these lights spanned an estimated 1 mile across the night sky. The estimated altitude was approx. 500 feet.  I was on my way home from work when I spotted this.  I was heading east on Baker St. Extension, approx. 2 miles from the city limits of Jamestown, N.Y.  These lights were near a radio station tower. The tower is approx. 200 feet high and by comparison, that's how I was able to estimate the altitude of these lights.  I did not see the shape or outline of any spacecraft, only the porthole lights. I did not think it was one craft but many in formation. However, after seeing video of the Phoenix Lights, I now know it was one craft.  The video of the Phoenix Lights captured EXACTLY what I saw. When this event occurred, I pulled my car over to the side of the highway. I got out of my car and just observed it for about 10 minutes. I got into my car and kept glancing at it as I was driving into the city.  I lost sight of it as the city lights flooded out my view of the sky.  I checked the local paper the next day to see if this event had been witnessed and reported by anyone else. To my great disappointment, nothing! No mention of it in the newspaper or on the local radio stations. Thank you for accepting my report. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

3 red lights and one white light moving fast in the clear night sky;2012-06-09 22:55:00;minute;3 red lights and one white light moving fast in the clear night sky On 06/09/2012  at approx.1055PM my Husband and I were returning home and as I got out of the car I could see 2 red lights over the neighbors garage moving quickly north east in the sky.  One was directly behind the other over the neighbors garage at about 1 o'clock.  I heard no noise or motor like a plane, jet, or helicopter.  I yelled to my husband to look and he ran closer and attempted to take a picture with his cell phone.  The 2 red lights were followed by another red light as it flew and came into view over the garage followed by a white light.  It appeared as though they were flying one behind the other in equal distance.  One by one they disappeared from my view because of the street tree line and I did not see where they went from there.;42.0930000000004;-79.2439999999995
