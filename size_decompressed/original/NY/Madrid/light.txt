Bright flash turns into three smaller objects.;2008-10-23 20:30:00;3 minutes;Bright flash turns into three smaller objects I was leaving a relatives home about 8:30pm along a highway with many fields on each side. The night sky was very clear and just as I got onto the highway a bright flash of light emerged through the branches of a large tree next to a farmhouse.  As I drove past the tree I noticed it was a light that was moving through the sky. I watched it for the next minute as I drove about a mile and then it disappeared.  I pulled the car over to maybe capture something on my cell phone but could not retrieve it in time.  I was looking over a large field with a very clear view of the sky and the object reemerged as a very bright light and then split into three smaller moving lights.  The lights moved for a few seconds and then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));44.7688;-75.1436
