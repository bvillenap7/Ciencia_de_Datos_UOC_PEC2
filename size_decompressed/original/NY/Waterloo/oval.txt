I watched about an hour of this, and went to my neighbor because I wanted another adult to see what I was seeing.   I had pulled out my Meade 8‚Äù lx200 telescope, so they could view it.  They told me they had been watching it for some time, when it was NE.   4 adults and 4 children looked through the telescope and saw an oval almost circle with a dozen plus lights that gradually went from bright white to dim yellow as if on battery power, and draining down.   There was a flashing dim light on the bottom of this object like a distant airplane.   One of those looking through my scope said she could see a person in the middle wearing green.  She took a picture through the scope with her cell phone.;42.9009999999999;-76.8752999999999
