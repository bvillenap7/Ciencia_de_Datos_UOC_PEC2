Triangular Craft with Bright LED-like flashers moving west over I-90;2006-11-21 20:45:00;15 Seconds;Triangular Craft with Bright LED-like flashers moving west over I-90 I was on the Thruway (I-90) just past Waterloo Premium Outlets driving east toward exit 41 (approx 8:45pm).   I saw a bright flash on the horizon like from the ridiculously bright water tower flasher in Seneca Falls.  I figured it was one of those.  Its light was certainly too bright to be an airplane, and it was instant-on, instant-off like an LED, but really bright.   The color was bluish-white much like an LED flashlight.  It was probably as bright as the water tower flasher in Seneca Falls… but this was no water tower.   The flash was moving westbound above the interstate.  Within a four or five flashes,  probably five seconds (it wasn’t flashing quite every second) it was passing over us.  It must have been a bit north of the thruway because I could see it by looking out of the driver’s window.   The lights reflected off of some type of metallic silver body of the craft, but I was unable to get a good grasp of shape or size.  My eyes were confused just looking at it.  It seemed to be triangular with two lights at each point of the triangle.   Leaning towards the window and looking straight up, I was hardly watching the road at this point.  Good thing there wasn’t a lot of traffic.  It was not any passenger airplane, that’s for sure.  Those lights were too bright, and there was zero sign of the craft between the flashes.
