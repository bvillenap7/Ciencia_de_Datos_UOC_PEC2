White spherical object and missing time;2006-01-15 02:00:00;Several minutes;White spherical object and missing time As I was driving home on a back road to my house after having dropped off some friends after a night out I noticed a bright light, spherical in shape, off to the left side of my car.  It was about 75 yards away from me and I would say it was about 50-75 yards above the ground.  I passed by some woods and the thing seemed to travel right over the tree tops and it traveled just as freely as I passed some fields.  It appeared to be lighted from within.  There were no visible external lights and it was slightly larger than a basketball in size when held at an arm's length.  I've seen these spheres before, first time being in 1991 on my way home from work in the middle of the night.  Subsequent sightings took place while I lived in Florida and now I've relocated back to upstate NY (my latest sighting).  After a few minutes, this sphere came close to my car as I drove and it kept pace with me.  It was as strange a sight just as the previous times. I've made a few reports to this site before and I know that there really is something out there.  Although this may seem impertinent, but what I thought should only take me a few minutes to get home, I was shocked to realize that I'd lost 1 hour and a half by the time I arrived.;42.9009999999999;-76.8752999999999
