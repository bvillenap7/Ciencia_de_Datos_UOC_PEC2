UFO sighting on Long Island, the night of the blackout.;2003-08-14 18:30:00;3-5 min.;UFO sighting on Long Island, the night of the blackout. It was bewtween 5 and 8pm, the night of the blackout, on Long Island, I saw a low flying formation of white and orange lights. I thought it was another type of popular aircraft that I'd seen before but it was too low, extremely slow moving and very quiet. Being that there was no noise outside, that was obvious.I couldn't make out a shape at all. Then it disappeared behind a group of trees. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
