As we drove West on Southern State Pkwy., just past Exit 22 (Meadowbrook Pkwy.), a blue-green sphere shaped object zoomed very fast across the sky from East to West. We did not have the radio on and the windows were open. There was no sound from the object. After arriving home about 20 minutes later, we noticed the clouds looked like they were cut in half with a knife and we saw a huge white streak of mist and/or exhaust going in the same direction as the object flew.  the moon became very visible and we saw some stars. 5 minutes later approx 12:05am, we heard heliocopters in the distance. As the white streak dissapated, the haze and clouds covered the sky again, the stars were no longer visable and the moon was back in the haze again.;40.6505;-73.5832
