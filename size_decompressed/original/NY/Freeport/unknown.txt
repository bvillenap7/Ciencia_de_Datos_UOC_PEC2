Strange sight on Long Island...daytime;2005-06-10 14:00:00;30 seconds;Strange sight on Long Island...daytime Was driving on the Loop parkway heading towards the Meadowbrook parkway when I saw an object in the NE sky flash when sunlight hit it. The gleam caught my eye and I then started to follow it. The object seemed to have sharp corners was chrome in color/reflectivity and had a tumbling motion as it headed North/Northwest from a Southeast origin. Object was moving extremely fast, too fast to be mistaken for mylar balloons. It was at a speed consistant with military jets seen at an airshow 2 weeks prior, but the shape was not an aircraft. The only way it can be described would be is that it looked like a shard of glass in its shape, tumbled like it was out of control, but never lost altitude and was moving extremely fast.;40.6505;-73.5832
