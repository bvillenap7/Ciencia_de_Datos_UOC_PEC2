When the beam would shut off red flickering lights would cut on and off at the bottom of the craft.  It kept flying over five or six blocks and a school yard as if it we're looking for something.  It had four orange lights south north east and west on the body of the craft.  At one point it pointed a beam directly at Me twice.  It was intimidating to even look at, but we were also in awe viewing it.  It was amazing to say the least.  When I finally  got the  courage to try and record it, it left the area with out returning.;40.6505;-73.5832

There was this ovalish craft flying west, it had lights all around the bottom of it that were flashing order of left to right.   When they flashed the ones in the middle were very much brighter than the rest.   Then it glided into the trees and I could no longer see it.;40.6505;-73.5832
