I PULL UP TO THE HOUSE AND MY HUSBAND TELLS ME WHAT HE SAW.  I THEN LOOK UP AT THE SKY TO SEE TWO TWO HOVERING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SKY AND THEM I LOOK TO THE LEFT PART OF THE SKY AND SEE 6 OF THEM IN FLYING STRAIGHT AHEAD IN PAIRS.  THEY LOOKED LIKE ORANGE FLAMES BUT WERE FLYING AROUND VERY CONTROLLED AND UNIFORMED LIKE REGULAR AIRCRAFTS BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN THESE TYPE OF LIGHTS AND MOVEMENT BEFORE BECUASE WE LIVE CLOSE TO JFK AIRPORT AND IN THE SKY WE KNOW HOW AIRPLANE LIGHTS LOOK. ALSO WE DID NOT HEAR A SINGLE SOUND FROM THESE AIRCRAFTS WHAT SO EVER. IT WAS EXTREMELY SILENT BUT HOVERED CLOSE.;40.6505;-73.5832
