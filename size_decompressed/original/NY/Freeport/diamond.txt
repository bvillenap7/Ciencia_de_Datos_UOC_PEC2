I was looking at the clouds, as I looked up I saw the three small white/silver diamond shapes they moved really fast behind a cloud.  I told my wife what I saw she was on the platform with me.  We looked into the sky.  They then flew past in the same way from the direction they started from then back behind the cloud.
