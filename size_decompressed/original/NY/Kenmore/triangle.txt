Pinpoint jade green lights in triangular formation.;2017-08-13 03:30:00;Unknown;Pinpoint jade green lights in triangular formation I was out on my balcony having a smoke before bed and noticed that the sky was very clear.  While looking up admiring the view, I noticed many faint, pinpoint jade green lights in an elongated triangular formation.  This is difficult to describe...the lights were fading in and out, it almost looked as if the tiny lights on this massive object were pulsing or something.  Every few seconds a very faint orangish yellow light would sweep across it, almost like a spotlight.  I kept rubbing my eyes because I was so boggled by this sight and just couldn't believe what I was seeing.  I tried to take pictures but my phone camera wouldn't suffice. I went back in to my house to do a search online to see if someone might have reported this, or even better if I could find a video of it.  I went back outside to look again and it was still there.  It was stationary and this is really blowing my mind.  Many nights I've noticed the color-changing orbs flashing in random areas amongst the stars, they come and go frequently, but I've never been alarmed by them, as I am so used to seeing them. And no, they aren't stars or satellites.  This thing with the green lights was definitely a massive object sitting way up in the sky.  It also seems a lot further away than the pulsating orbs, seeing that the lights were like pinpoints up there.  It's quite extraordinary, and I have been racking my brain trying to find some sort of information about it.  Of all the things I have witnessed in my life, this is worth reporting.  What the hell can it be?  It's driving me mad.;42.9732000000003;-78.8475000000001
