Red light with multiple small yellowish-white flashing lights on either side in a rectangle shape.;2015-12-16 23:54:00;4-5 minutes;Red light with multiple small yellowish-white flashing lights on either side in a rectangle shape.. I was taking a bag of garbage to the curb, and since is was partly clear, I looked up at the constellation of Orion.  (My home faces due South ).  Off to my right a noticed a red light in the sky at about 40 degrees elevation.  Since there is quite a bit of air traffic usually heading for Buffalo International Airport, I at first thought it was a plane.   Then I noticed there were several small lights (yellowish-white) blinking left and right with not apparent pattern of the steady red light.  The object proceeded from the SW to NE at a steady pace until it passed almost overhead to my East.  I could not see any shape, just the lights but it had the odd effect of looking like it was moving side to side and forward at the same time.  I at no time hear any type of engine noise of a jet. prop or helicopter.  As it passe over the house I lost sight of it so took the garbage to the tote.  When I turned around the object had changed direction to WSW.  The red light still appeared to be in the center with the random flashing lights on either side.  As it was almost out of view it passed close and below a small patch of clouds which became dimly lit with white light. I had no idea the altitude the object was at, so when I went inside I checked for cloud ceiling on my computer.  There were scattered clouds at 10,14 and 23,000 ft.  My guess the clouds I saw were at 10,000 ft. I never did notice any green lights.  The impression of the shape would be a rectangle, but I could not make out any solid object.;42.9732000000003;-78.8475000000001
