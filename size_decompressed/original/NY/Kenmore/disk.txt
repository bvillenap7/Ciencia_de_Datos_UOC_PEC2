Low, loud, flat bottomed craft flew over my home.;2014-12-23 00:05:00;10 minutes;Low, loud, flat bottomed craft flew over my home. I noticed a very bright light in the sky, towards the direction of the city of Buffalo, which I think is West.  It would have been about 2 miles away and not very high in the sky, as it was at about the height of the radio/tv tower  on top of channel WIVB, which was to this lightâ€™s right.   It was stationary for several minutes, then started to move slowly.  It picked up speed, but not altitude.  It went over my house  and  In the direction of Tonawanda.  It had a flatish bottom and on one side of the bottom was a neon green light.  It made the sound of a loud vacuum, a pulsing sound.  Very unlike a plane or a helicopter.  It made a fast  circular maneuver and moved left and out of sight at an incredible speed.;42.9732000000003;-78.8475000000001
