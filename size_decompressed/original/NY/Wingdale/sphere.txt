I (24 year old female) have a long history of paranormal activity going on around me since a young age.  I moved to Wingdale, NY, with my parents in 2010, and started having more and more experiences.  I have been told that I am an Indigo child since a young age as well.  I have seen reflective blue eyes watching me several times, high pitched whistling and several spherical UFOs over my house. On July 11, around 2 in the morning, I was walking home from a friend's house when I looked up in the sky.  The walk from my friends house to my house was about 45 minutes long.  There were five small red flashing spheres along with a larger orange sphere in a large circle, about 2 miles across surrounding the area. They seemed to move with me as I walked the half mile to my house.   As soon as I stepped inside the house, I ran to a window to watch the two that I could see (a red sphere as well as the larger orange one) zoom off and disappear.  There was a slight trail behind the orange sphere.;41.6558;-73.5554
