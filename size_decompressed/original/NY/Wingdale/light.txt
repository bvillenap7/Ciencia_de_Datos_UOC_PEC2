Star like object moving in abnormal flight pattern.;2012-05-27 22:00:00;15 minutes;Star like object moving in abnormal flight pattern. Guests spotted a satellite streaming across the sky. As they brought it to our attention the satellite stopped and then moved side to side as if hanging on a wire for several minutes.  It was there long enough for us to grab binoculars and see it was two lights that seemed to circle around each other.  It stayed mostly int he western sky.  Our vision was then obscured by clouds from the thunderstorm.;41.6558;-73.5554

Several dim lights moving back and forth countering each other in the Eastern sky over Wingdale, NY. I went to see my aunt in NY for dinner and fireworks on July 3rd, 2016. After we ate and lit some fireworks we decided to go to the back of the house and watch the neighbor's light show towards the Northeast.  As that wound down I just had that urge to look up towards the Eastern sky and I noticed a dim star start moving North within the triangular star formation I was using for reference.  I then noticed another dim object moving South from the same area. I then got my daughter and my cousin to hone in on these dim, high altitude objects moving counter to each other.  I finally got my aunt to see the last 1 or 2 objects. Usually, satellites move at a steady pace across the sky.  Not back and forth in a confined area.  And not 4 or 5 of them in the same area. Similar to a siting I made from my New Milford, CT, home early 2016, facing West (toward NY) at 3:30am.  I could not sleep that night.  Was stargazing to the West then suddenly the bright star shot up and out and dimmed accordingly as if leaving Earth orbit at high speed.  I can't explain these sitings.;41.6558;-73.5554
