It was a clear night out and the stars were visible, so I looked up to check out what stars were visible.   I observed an orange cigar shaped object directly above me, high up in the sky.  It was moving about in a zig-zag pattern. I didn't think much of it and went inside when I finished my pipe.  When I went out again around 11:30pm to smoke, again I observed the same object to the right of its original position, this time moving left to right, back and forth.   This time I called my step-father outside and he saw it as well.  He had no explantion for what it was either.  When he went to pick my mother up from work, he looked to see if it was still there and he said it was now off to the left in the sky, again moving in a left to right pattern and pointed it out to my mother.;43.0083;-74.3688
