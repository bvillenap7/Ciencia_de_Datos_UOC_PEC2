I was driving a shuttle for the local transit company, when I saw a very large orange-red spherical object emerge from the clouds, dipping down in a swerving fashion towards the north, then north east.  It was going far too fast to be an airplane, drone or helicopter.  Far too big too.  When it turned east, it stopped in the air completely and I could then see a blinking light.  The way it maneuvered, it could not have been any traditional craft.   It was very cloudy and dark outside, but the craft could clearly be seen as I described, and if the clouds were about 4600 feet, the craft appeared to be the size of a tennis ball from where I was sitting inside the shuttle, meaning it was massive in size.  The shuttle has outside cameras, and I can provide the shuttle # and make if the transit company if you would like to request the video.  I can say for a fact, this was not an airplane, helicopter, drone, or any traditional craft, or anything that can be explained.  The maneuvering and speed was just way too out of our league.  I can't get the image of how it emerged from the clouds as it swooped down in a wavy pattern, then darted up, then stopped.  When it stopped and the light started flashing, it appeared to be merging with another craft and made appeared in a diamond shape with some kind of value or haze between them.  It truly reminded me of Close Encounters of the Third Kind.;43.0037000000001;-78.8495999999997
