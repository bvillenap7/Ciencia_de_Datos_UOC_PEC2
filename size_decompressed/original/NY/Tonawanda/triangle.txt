Aprox. twice the size of a passenger jet.  Also have seen this object stationary in another part of the sky and one other time moving earlier this summer.  Ligts change from orange glow to flashing red and white, and also go out at times revealing the shape of the craft.  Once saw two helicopters moving to its location but it disappeared before they could intercept it.;43.0037000000001;-78.8495999999997
