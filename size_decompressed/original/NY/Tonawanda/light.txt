I had left the blinds open to let in the moonlight as I went to sleep.  Just before five in the morning I awoke (as I often do several times a night to roll-over) when I noticed a bright light bouncing around outside the window.  I looked at it for a while without my glasses, concluded it deserved a better look because of the brightness and the motion (which I couldn't dismiss as a tree branch waiving in front of a star or an airplane), put my glasses on and went to the window.  There was an object of moderately bright light (as bright as the moon had been hours earlier) with occasional fainter white and red pulses associated with it in the sky to the WSW, just more than halfway up (50-55 degrees?) from the horizon.  The object did not appear to be very close, but it kept skipping around that sector of the sky.  There were also two eratically moving objects farther to the West, perhaps 20 degrees above the horizon, which appeared as a single bright light.  I couldn't tell much about the two distant objects--only that they were bouncing around and moving in the sky.  The nearer object zigzagged about, sometimes nearer, sometimes farther (although always fairly distant).  I observed for almost half an hour.  I looked at the objects both straight-on and with my perhipheral vision and they appeared the same. I noted the position of several stars and, since I watched for a fair bit of time, noted how the stars moved.  These objects (even the far ones) did not move with the celestial bodies.  That is, I could tell that the sector of sky they were bouncing-around in was moving relative to the stars. Ocassionally, fainter objects appeared in the sky, but I think those were stars...they didn't bounce around.  An airplane at altitude flew over, but did not appear at all like the objects and did not interact with the objects.  As time wore on the near object gradually was working its way to the SW and wasn't getting any closer.  I decided I'd seen the best I was going to see and it was time to get back to sleep.  The time was just past 5:20 AM. The weather was very cold (maybe about 10F), winds were present but low, the ground was snow-covered (2 snowpack) and the sky was cloudless. What a wierd thing to see!;43.0037000000001;-78.8495999999997
VERY BRIGHT SOLID BALL OF LIGHT IN SKY - MOVING SLOWLY - NO SOUND - NO BLINKING LIGHTS;2012-02-17 18:45:00;15 minutes;VERY BRIGHT SOLID BALL OF LIGHT IN SKY - MOVING SLOWLY - NO SOUND - NO BLINKING LIGHTS I happen to look out the second story window of my home in the northwest direction at 18:45 on Friday, February 17, 2012.  I notice one solid bright ball of light moving very slowly in a clear sky above Kenmore East High School from west to NNE.  I've seen this type of light in the sky the past couple of years traveling in the same west to east direction.  The lighted ball was large in size and very bright.  No sound, no strobe lights as seen on aircraft.  It maintained a steady slow speed, light remained the same size.   As the light maintained the same altitude as it moved across the sky, a few commercial aircraft traveling at a higher altitude in a east to west direction passed above it.   As this object traveled farther east, the light dimmed.  It seem to have dropped below the reflective light of the setting sun.;43.0037000000001;-78.8495999999997
Orange ball of light.;2014-08-19 22:30:00;1 minute;Orange ball of light Distinctly orange object or ball of light moving slowly from North to South at what appeared to be high altitude.   It then became stationary for about 15 seconds before disappearing.  It looked like a star or planet, except about three times as large.   The orange glow grew repeatedly brighter and dimmer for as long as it was visible. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
