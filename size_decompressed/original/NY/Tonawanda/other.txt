Whatever I saw, it was pretty big. I'd say atleast five times the size of any light beacons on the towers near my home. It traveled from NE to SW at a very high speed, was a very light fluorescent blue in color, and left a trail behind it. I'm not sure how long it was actually visible because there were some trees obstructing my view. I may have just seen the tail end of this objects flight path. The night sky was extremely clear and I also noticed alot more air traffic than usual. I want to say the tip of it was rounded, almost like a roundnose pistol bullet. I'm pretty sure it wasn't a meteor. I am not an expert on these things, but I can definitely say I've never seen anything like this before.;43.0037000000001;-78.8495999999997
Craft with 3 lights on belly of craft slowly traveling over tonawanda, new york;2012-01-20 05:54:00;10 minutes;craft with 3 lights on belly of craft slowly traveling over tonawanda, new york On january 20th, 2012 at approximatley 5:54 am, I was on my way to work and driving over a bridge that connects the town of Tonawanda and North Tonawanda on River Road in Western New York. As I crested the top of the bridge, I noticed a bright light in the sky off to my right coming from the direction of the city of Buffalo area.  This caught me off gaurd because though there is an airport close by, I've never seen any aircraft come from that direction, at least being this low to the ground. continuing down Military road in Tonawanda,NY,  I could see it was coming in my direction and by the time I got to about 400 yards away from the underpass for the I-90 it was passing almost directly over top of my car at I would guess a couple hundred feet and at a speed of around 20-30mph. this object had 3 lights on the belly of the craft  equally spaced out and blinking lights on what at first I thought were wings of a plane but as it passed over I realized it wasn't.  I could see the far side due to lights in a parking lot for the highway department.and what I thought was a wing actually sort of looked like the arms that come off the side of a shrimp boat but I cannot be 100% sure on that due to it being more dark than light out. So,  I arrive at work to punch in at exactly 6am, go back outside to park my car and I can still see it heading towards the lockport area, not the other direction which is where the airport is. and that is when I could see a very bright light turn on, on the right side of it if ur looking at it from the rear. the light turned off then back on and stayed on. it's wasn't a beam of light though. at that point I then watched it until I couldn't see it anymore. I have seen random things in our skies that I myself and others with me at the time have questioned, but this is the first time ever I have felt compelled to write out a report and  submit it. -thankyou-;43.0037000000001;-78.8495999999997
