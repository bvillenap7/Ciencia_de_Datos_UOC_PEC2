Red to Blue flickering lights that's stationary.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD));2014-08-11 01:00:00;2 hours;Red to Blue flickering lights that's stationary. My Wife & I were looking at the full Moon with binoculars, when we noticed a flickering reddish blue object in the northern sky.   The lights kept changing from red to blue and appeared to be stationary.  We watched for about 10 minutes then went back inside.   We went back outside an hour later and the strange lights were in the eastern sky.  The full moon had only moved a short distance as compared to the strange lights were seen on the opposite side of the night sky.   The lights keep changing from red to blue but the object seems to be stationary.   We are going back outside to see if we can still see the lights.  It's 2:00am est.
