Almost chasing each other in zigzag formation.  Moving fast.   We stopped and stared up in the night sky to see these two objects seemingly playing with each other.  What seemed like forever.  Were gone a 10-15 second flash.   My family and I never mentioned it again.   Beyond technology available to public at that time.;43.0037000000001;-78.8495999999997
Multiple yellow globes silently streaming past house for ten min. in a long strung out disconnected line.;2010-07-17 21:38:00;Approx.10 min;Multiple yellow globes silently streaming past house for ten min. in a long strung out disconnected line. I received a phone call from an acquaintance who asked me what was going on at the Niagara Falls Air Force Base as they knew I worked there.  I said what did they mean and they then proceeded to say look up in the sky.   I took a quick glance out the front window and saw five to seven yellow with a tint of red globes traveling in a Northwest to Southeast direction in no particular formation and all traveling the same speed.   I told my wife to look and she ran for the camera and we went out into the front yard and watched as the globes kept coming.  The person on the phone said I had all ready missed about 20 of them.  They kept coming in groups of 2 to 5 for another ten minutes or so primarily strung out in a long disconnected line.  My wife proceeded to take pictures and one video clearly showing the globes in flight.  Although difficult to ascertain, my experience at the Air Base leads me to believe they were at or about 2,000-3,000 feet in elevation.  You can see ! in the video the faintest sunlight as they proceed across the sky.  We have pictures and a video we will attempt to attach or load onto your website.;43.0037000000001;-78.8495999999997
3 redidish organge cicle/spheres seen over Tonawanda NY;2011-08-28 21:00:00;20  minutes;3 redidish organge cicle/spheres seen over Tonawanda, NY I was driving down Eggert Rd in Tonawanda NY at 21:00 on August 28th 2001, when I happened to look out of my passengerâ€™s side window and saw a reddish orange circle/sphere in the sky.  I continued to watch the object as I drove down the road.   Once I stopped at a light, I opened my windows to see if there were any more objects in the sky.  Behind me, approximately a block away, I saw two more of the same objects traveling in the same direction as the first keeping a steady distance between them.  The first object that seemed to be leading the way looked about twice as big as the other two and twice as bright.  It did not keep a constant speed the entire time.  It did seem to almost stop on two occasions and also accelerate very quickly.   It then seemed to hover for about 20 seconds, drop down slightly, it got a little brighter then I guess you can say it faded out very quickly. I could not see it travel away it just got smaller and smaller until it was gone.   The o! ther two objects we still in the sky when this happened, moving just as they were before. I then turned around so that I would be able to see them better.  Unfortunately they did travel to where there were buildings in the way of my view so I did not see where they went from there.  I was able to get a very short video of the one. It is not a very good quality since it was on my cell phone and I was also moving at the time.;43.0037000000001;-78.8495999999997
Streaking light headed North / North East;2012-02-06 19:00:00;10 - 15 minutes;Streaking light headed North / North East It was a very clear night with a full moon.  I was standing in my driveway with a friend when we noticed what at first appeared to be a star, but began streaking across the sky headed in northern and slightly eastern direction.  My friend thought perhpas it was a satellite.  But as the object moved directly overhead, it appeared to grow in size (perhaps descending?) and the light became much more intense and brighter.   The object then continued moving northeast and faded in intensity, but moved in a non-linear path, curving from a norhteast path to a northwest path, until it faded from sight.;43.0037000000001;-78.8495999999997

A plane went thru same area about 15 minutes later and I could hear it and see the lights flashing the orange glow had none of these features.;43.0037000000001;-78.8495999999997
