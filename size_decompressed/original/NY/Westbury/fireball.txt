I was driving down Jericho Turnpike in Syosset, NY at 8:30 p.m. on Saturday night September 18, 2010.   I was heading east and right past Underhill Blvd I saw 3 orange lights in the sky in the shape of the big dipper.  I thought it was cool that I could see it and then realized that it isn’t the big dipper!   Then 2 more came into sight.   I pulled over to the left in a parking lot and got out of the car to look.  They were moving slowly in the same pattern – the 3 of them and the 2 trailing.  They were bright orange, not flashing.   Three men came out of a restaurant and I asked them what they saw and they said “I guess it’s a plane” I said are you sure, they said no, but they don’t know what it could be.  It had to be about 10 minutes since I first saw them and then they slowly went out of sight towards the North sky.  There might have been a glow around the edges.  I took out my phone to take a picture, but the parking center sign was too bright.  It was ve! ry cool!;40.7587999999999;-73.5661
