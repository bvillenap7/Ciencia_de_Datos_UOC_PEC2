I live 10 minutes from there so its an area i am very familiar with. 3...Pics were taken in the parking lott of Roosevelt Field Mall facing east...if needs be i can provide exact location(parking spot) for your investigation if you feel necessary.  I was parking in the last spot in the row so its easy to get proper perspective and backdrop for analysis   4...was not that far off in distance, weather was overcast and rainy so long distance sight was not an option   5...broad daylight as you can see by attached pictures so other witnesses are potential.;40.7587999999999;-73.5661
