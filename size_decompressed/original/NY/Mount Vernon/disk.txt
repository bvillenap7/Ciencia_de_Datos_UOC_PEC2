What I say Was the 3 Ships moving back up down sideways when they left thet must have hit 3000 miles per hour .and I could not take my eyes of them for they were atleast 12,000 feet up and I knew I would loose site if I asked any one to look up for I had to concentrate just to see them. This was becuase I was in the wadding pool on the beach chairs on my back and I have always loved to look up to the stars since I was a child in the hills of Puerto Rico. I Know they exist. only idiots are Skipticle.;40.9221112;-73.8278216
