My girlfriend and I were looking out of my fifth floor apartment window on this clear night when we both saw a steadily flashing white light in the sky over the Yonkers/Mt. Vernon border. At first it was stationary and then much to our surprise it dropped an impossible distance and effortlessly circled and shifted its position with unbelievable ease and speed. We observed the familiar lights of a commercial jet in the distance which gave us a frame of reference to place this object closer to us than the plane as it passed in between. It continued to move up and down and from side to side, sometimes at dizzying speed, for almost 40 minutes unitl at least two helicopters arrived, presumably, to investigate it.  Up until the helicopters arrival we had not noticed that the object was moving about in total silence. The din of the choppers gave us that frame of reference. Nothing had been reported on the news, however, the local authorities did state that they had received numerous calls reporting the same object.;40.9221112;-73.8278216
