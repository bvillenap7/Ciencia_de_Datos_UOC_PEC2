Many hovering, quiet aircraft over Rockland Co (NY) & Bergen County (NJ).;2016-02-28 20:55:00;on-going;Many hovering, quiet aircraft over Rockland Co (NY) & Bergen County (NJ) My wife, son and daughter counted more than 10 and as many as 16 aircraft hovering, then moving nearly soundlessly over Rockland Co.  (We drove from Nyack to Suffern, NY) and northern Bergen Co., NJ.   They appeared to be drones (certainly not helicopters, as they were close enough to see their lights in detail, but made almost no sound).   They were performing some kind of coordinated group activity, with the aircraft moving then hovering, then some moving together (flying at the same speed and direction) for a short while before diverging.   It was really interesting, because between 8:45 and 9:15 you could look in almost any direction and see two of three of the craft moving through the sky.;41.1199;-74.1242
