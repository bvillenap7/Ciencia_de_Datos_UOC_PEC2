Upstate NY sightings;2002-05-26 18:25:00;2 minutes;Upstate NY sightings I saw an object fly from east to the center of the sky and then make an uprupt change to the SSW.  It flew under two commercial airliners, so I am approximating its altitude at 10000 feet.  If it was at this altitude, I would make an estimate that it was 40-50 feet long.  It was white and the shape was like a tylenol caplet. It had no wings, markings, vapor trail, windows, doors, or anything.  The whole event lasted a couple of minutes.  I called another family member out of the house to see it, and they saw the same thing I did.  I have seen these craft flying before.  Once back in 1994 about 10 miles NE of Binghamton, NY, I saw a similar craft.  I watched as an F-16 went chasing after it at about 15000 feet.  It went hiding in a few clouds, and was just toying with the jet. I was the only person in a parking lot at the time to witness that one.  It was a Fall day, about 4 PM.  I hope that this helps.  Also during both sitings, the objects made no noise.;42.1506000000004;-76.0551000000005
