Glowing stationary sphere;2004-06-12 16:45:00;20 minutes;Glowing stationary sphere I was looking up on a clear day with only light and whispy clouds here and there.  I was looking slightly north when I noticed a jet liner fly by past a glowing white sphere that was just sitting there. This sphere was many miles up since the jet passed below it.  It did start to drift ever so slightly west after about 20 minutes and then all of the sudden vanished.  I looked up towards the sky again 15 minutes later and saw the same craft shoot by on a west-east trajectory at incredible speeds, much fast than a jet but a little slower than a shooting star.  It left no contrail, made no noise.  There have been other similar sightings in the area for years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Round bright light object change the direction with 90 degrees on a high speed rate.;2019-09-07 20:35:00;20 seconds;Round bright light object change the direction with 90 degrees on a high speed rate. I was out on my porch at 20:35pm, watching the sky in the direction of the moon.  Suddenly I noticed a round object that was the size of a star which was traveling at high speeds in the South East direction.  For approximately 18 seconds the object had a straight trajectory. Suddenly, within 2 seconds, it changed the direction towards the North at a higher speed and it disappeared.  I believe that it wasn't an airplane, nor did it have any blinking lights.;42.1506000000004;-76.0551000000005
