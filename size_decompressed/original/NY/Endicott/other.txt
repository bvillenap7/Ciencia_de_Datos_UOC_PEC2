Strange light anomoly in the southern sky over Endicott, NY.;2013-07-14 23:00:00;35 minutes;Strange light anomoly in the southern sky over Endicott, NY. Looking almost directly south I observed what I thought to be two stars lined up with each other, but noticed flashing lights.  I live on the approach way to the Binghamton airport and thought it was perhaps a plane.  However, this light anomaly didn't move it remained stationary.   I managed to count at least 12 flashes of light in an oval like formation around the two lights that looked like stars.  I observed this for a little over a half an hour and then around 12:15 am it just totally vanished.   We have a clear, starry sky so there were no clouds to block it from view.  It was there and then it just (as I said) vanished.     I tried to photograph it with my digital camera but the pictures did not turn out.  I did however draw a diagram of the star formation it was near to in order to give an idea of where this appeared in the sky.  I have photo copied the outline drawing and am emailing it to the link below.;42.1506000000004;-76.0551000000005
