Watching two (2) Hot-Air Balloons and one (1) Unknown  At 21:15PM on August 7th, 2003 I was watching two hot-air balloons, and deceided to get my camera. After taking 9 pictures with my Olympus Digital D-360L I went back inside to my computer. I downloaded the pictures to my computer, and was astonished on what I saw. In the 6th picture you see the two hot-air balloons. In the 7th picture you see two hot-air balloons and one Unknown object. Finally in the last two you notice it was never seen again. Was it the cloudy weather that was hiding it?? Looks similar to the one FOX Albany caught?? ((NUFORC Note:  Photo was forwarded to NUFORC, and we feel the witness describes the photo accurately.  However, we have no reason to believe that the object necessarily is a UFO.  It could have been, we believe, a bird or an insect, which caused the blurred streak across the photograph.
