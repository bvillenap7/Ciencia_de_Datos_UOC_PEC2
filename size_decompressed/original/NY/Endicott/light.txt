Light darting at angles at night;2009-05-09 23:45:00;1 minute;Light darting at angles at night I live somewhat rural so I can usually see the stars pretty well. I also live about 10 miles from a small airport so I do see a lot of planes crossing the sky. I'm used to that, but tonight I went onto the back deck and noticed two lights. I almost looked away as I said this is nothing unusual, but it caught my attention suddenly that one of the lights was darting, then it would angle and dart again. I think it happened about 3 or 4 times, but being alone I was afraid and ran back into the house (Sorry, that part is embarrassing, I guess I've seen too many scary movies). When I noticed the one light darting that way I wasn't paying attention to the other, it may have moved I don't know. I've never seen a UFO and maybe this wasn't, I kind of hope it wasn't, but I've never seen anything even remotely like it and I'd sure like to know what it was. Thank you.;42.1506000000004;-76.0551000000005
