A little glowing moving dot in the middle of the day;2004-08-18 14:00:00;4 min;A little glowing moving dot in the middle of the day It was very bright out. I looked up at the sky and I saw a glowing dot. It looked like a star but it was day so it couldn't have been a star. It was still at first then it started moving then stopped again. I ran inside to get a camera so i had proof but it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.1158;-75.3047
Bright orb with no sound that moved slowly east and stayed low in the sky.;2012-03-21 06:00:00;3 minutes;Bright orb with no sound that moved slowly east and stayed low in the sky. Bright orb.  Thought it was a bright star until I realized it was moving.  Assumed plane or satellite, but it was moving too slow for satellite and was larger in size and had no other lights on it (i.e. red).  Did not blink, but stayed bright white.  Appeared low in the sky.  Moved east.  Watched for about 4 minutes until it disappeared in beginning morning light.  Made no engine sound.  Stayed very quiet.;43.1158;-75.3047
