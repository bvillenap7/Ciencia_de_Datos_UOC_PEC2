Watched small silver orb traverse 1/3rd of the sky and disappear in plain sight.;2001-09-04 15:45:00;10-15 seconds;Watched small silver orb traverse 1/3rd of the sky and disappear in plain sight. My friend and I were lounging around her pool and leaning up against the walls, looking up at the sky.  It was a beautiful sunny day with some clouds but mostly long expanses of cloudless sky.  Where there WERE clouds, I would estimate that the ceiling was at 1000' approx.  I happened to call her attention to this one little lone circular cloud in this big expanse of blue sky.  As soon as I did, there just appeared something in front of the cloud that started moving north to south in a fast straight line.  It was silver and round and looked about the size of a BB held at arms length.  I said what IS that?.  She said it's not a bird and I said it's not a plane at the same time and just at that moment it disappeared, like it had some type of cloaking device. There were no other clouds in that part of the sky and it just disappeared from view as we watched it. I suspect that it was hidden behind the lone circular cloud because at no time did I see it enter my line of sight from north to south.  As soon as I called her attention to the cloud, it was just there in front of it. The strange thing is that I got the feeling it KNEW we had spotted it and were discussing it. It covered about 1/3 of the sky from horizon to horizon in about 10 seconds.  It was traveling faster than a jet.   The strange thing is that even though we had just seen something we had NEVER seen before, we just kind of went back to our conversation after saying something like wow.  I didn't think about it til later that it was strange that we were so low key about it.
