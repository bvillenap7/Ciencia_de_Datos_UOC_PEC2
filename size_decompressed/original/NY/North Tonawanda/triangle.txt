As it got closer could make out a horizontal bar of light, not the usual round aircraft light. Even closer could make out a wing (v)shape, thought it was a sea gull reflecting off street lights.  Even closer it had the shape of a hand glider going 30 mph at 300'(2.5 trees high). crossed the back yard about 5 houses down, distance 4 or 5 stone throws away. Made an instant 60 degree turn headed s/w towards Buffalo & Lake Erie. Was flying parallel to New greenhouse along buried steam lines to New steam plant just south of my house when it turned. I feel it was mapping this newly constructed source of energey.;43.0505;-78.8529999999998
4 objects appeared in the eastern sky approx 30 degrees above the horizon near jupiters position at the time.they were very bright as t;2010-09-05 20:50:00;20 min;4 objects appeared in the eastern sky approx 30 degrees above the horizon near jupiters position at the time.they were very bright as they outshined jupiter which was at magnitude -2.9 . they flew in a formation of 4 for a time (lazily).2 broke off to the north while the others bobbed up & down & twowards each other.they never seemed to get closer and there was no sound. what stuck me as odd when i first saw them as they were perfect triangles of light .not lit on each point, but solid light.when i first saw them they were bluish white,but when i came back out with my neighbors they seemed more reddish.the only reason i was looking in that area was i was trying to find jupiters rising position.the sky was not wide open at that position so i dont know how they left (blocked by trees and houses ).they couldnt have been helicopters because at the appearent size they were at ,you would have heard them. they were @ about twice jupiters appearent size in the sky.bu! t i got the feeling they were quite distant.the triangles were well defined,sharply outlined light with no fuzzines at the edges.i have been observing the night sky for some time and have never seen anything like it.i was so fascinated by them but i had to leave them for a few minutes (2 or 3 tops) to get my neighbors so they wouldnt think i was lying or a fruitcake.

Red pulsing lights in triangular shape moving in northeastern sky.;2015-07-12 22:00:00;<10 minutes;Red pulsing lights in triangular shape moving in northeastern sky Saw what appeared as a red light in the northern sky, travelling south east.  It stopped and started periodically.  It stopped in the northeastern sky and as I focused on it I realized there were three lights tightly grouped in a triangle shape.  The lights pulsed but did not blink.  I know called into the house for my family to come out to see this, as I called the lights seemed to fade quickly and just disappeared.  Odd coincidence, - we saw three shooting stars later that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.0505;-78.8529999999998
