Notice a bright star in the sky but after further examination it was moving.  It took up a position right behind the airliner keeping pace and chasing the jet. Traveling north easterly direction. Ufo never changed coarse but traveled in a straight line.  Called Syracuse air guard phone was busy signal. Called Buffalo hot line and told my story to reporter.  Also called 914th air gaurd and told them.  Had to be tracked on radar and other people must have seen it on a clear starrie night.  FAB.;43.0505;-78.8529999999998
