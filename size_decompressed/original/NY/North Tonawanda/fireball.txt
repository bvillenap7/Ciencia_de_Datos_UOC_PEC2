Leaving my house to walk my dog i immediately saw a bright orange glow in the northern sky.  I assume it was over Lake Ontario nased on its dostance.  It was so bright at first i thought a plane exploded, but didn't see actual fire.  It looked like it changed altitude and depth instantly.  Then just got fainter and more distant slowly.;43.0505;-78.8529999999998

A friend and myself were sitting in my back yard.  She looked into the sky over my garage and said what the heck is that? I could not believe my eyes.   I said it has to be a plane on fire..what else could it be?  It got pretty low, I remember saying it is going to land right here..then it started going higher and higher till all we saw was a dot in the sky then disapeared.
