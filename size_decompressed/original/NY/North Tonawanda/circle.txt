My friend and I who live in Buffalo, NY, drove out to North Tonawanda on July 4th to stroll around the Gateway Harbor and view the fireworks. While we were waiting on the bridge for the fireworks to begin there were a number of individual fireworks being set off by various people. As we watched the sky we noticed distinct red circles coming from two separate areas one after another.  One in particular turned very black against the night sky hovered for almost a minute and then vanished in front of our eyes.  All of the others were red and glowing.  They seemed to have a slight aura as they passed overhead.   One stream of objects were coming from the north and the other were coming from the southwest.  Although they were coming from different directions they were going towards the southeast.   They passed over us before and during the firework display.  Other people were commenting on them too.   We have no explanation for them, they were silent, and there were several planes in the air that must have seen them.;43.0505;-78.8529999999998
