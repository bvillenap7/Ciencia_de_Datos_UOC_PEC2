lighted stealth-like craft with white searching beam sighted flying low near Erie Barge canal, North Tonawanda;2000-12-04 21:40:00;10-15 minutes;lighted stealth-like craft with white searching beam sighted flying low near Erie Barge canal, North Tonawanda While my son & I were driving down Sweeney St by Erie Canal my son noticed lg ball of light in distance (like plane coming towards you only larger. It seemed to be traveling North but suddenly changed directions a few times. It began to travel easterly towards us diagonally across the road. As it came closer I noticed it had 5 or 6 white lights in a boomerang formation with a few aqua colored lights near the center. I pulled off to the side of a road in front of a house as it got closer. We turned of the radio and opened our windows as it passed in front of us not much higher than tree level. We could clearly make out a gray stealth-like shape about the size of a jet with 2 or 3 aqua lights towards the center. There was no sound & was travelling at a very slow speed. As it passed behind the house we were stopped in front of it stopped for a second and a white beam or spotlight began to search the field behind the house. It continued slowly eastward. The light turned off & then on again & it began to pick up speed. I wanted to turn my car around & follow it but my 12 year old son was frightened so we drove straight home (approx 1/2 mile from sighting. As for background information I am 37, a divorced mother of one, I have attended college, and I have worked as an office manager at a local payphone company for over 10 years. I have lived in the same apartment near the sighting for almost 12 years. My son will be 13 next month. He is a well adjusted, mature, and intelligent child. Neither one of us ever expected to ever have an experience like this. I am now a UFO agnostic who has become a believer.;43.0505;-78.8529999999998
Bell shaped craft in no hurry sight sees Niagra Falls & Buffalo.;2013-05-27 21:18:00;2 minutes;Bell shaped craft in no hurry sight sees Niagra Falls & Buffalo. Bell shaped object almost covered by thumb nail at arm's length.  It moved from west to south-east at three thousand ft.   Sun reflected red & orange off round bottom from horizon to 1/2 distance to my position(I was on roof of two story house with clear view W.S.&E).  Object was black with shimmer on each side moving at a constant  200mph., if I judged the altitude right.   When the object was closest to me, my dog in the house made one loude howl as if hurt.   As it traveled away from me a two prop driven plane, lights on, came out of the west at two thousand ft. 300mph, traveling to the NNW.  After the object passed the plane, it flashed red around its center once and continued till out of sight.;43.0505;-78.8529999999998
