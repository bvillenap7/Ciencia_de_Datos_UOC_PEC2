An orange light that zig-zags.;2009-03-01 14:23:00;15 seconds;An orange light that zig-zags We were coming back from the park a couple of blocks away from my house after playing basketball.  I heard a kind of warp sound but didn't think anything of it.    All of a suddenly, one of my friends said, 'Oh my (explitive) god! Look at that!'   I looked up in the sky and I saw a spherish light floating there with an orangish-red aura coming from it.  We watched it for about 10 seconds when it zig-zagged around about three times and then shot off about northbound.
