I walked outside to take the dog out and looked up as soon as I opened the door and as soon as I made contact the very bright, flat and almost triangular looking craft took off at extremely fast speeds in a south west direction.  There is no way this was military. Look at my location information.  I am at least 60 miles from a military base and the base is small.  As the craft moved my eyes began to water but that might have been because of my excitement in seeing it.   I have never been a believer of UFOs nor have i ever seen one till now.;43.317;-73.577
