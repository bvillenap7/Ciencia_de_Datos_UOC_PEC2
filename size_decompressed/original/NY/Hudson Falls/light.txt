At 9:03 pm last night I went out to put my car windows up and a bright light in the southern sky caught my eye.  I looked up and saw a round, very, very bright light moving in a northeasterly direction.  I watched for a few seconds observing the object.   There were no flashing lights, no strobing lights, no identifying lights as seen on the many planes that fly in our skies at night from the local airport.  There was no trail of any kind either.  It appeared to be a light - not something on fire or burning.   I quickly went to the porch, opened the door and called to my 14 yr old grandson to come look.  He came out and observed the object as well.  He said, Gram, get your camera!  I said, What is that?  It is so bright and moving so fast.   The light never changed in brightness or appearance as it approached me, passed over us, or moved away from us.  It appeared to be traveling at a low altitude and at a very high speed.  There was no sound to be heard as this object approached, flew over us and flew away from us.   Before we lost sight of it beyond the trees, my grandson was observing it with the binoculars:  I said, Look there is a plane headed in its direction (the plane was heading north and was in the eastern sky).  The plane had to have been at a much higher altitude as it appeared as a pin dot to us, but you could clearly make out the red flashing lights.  The unknown object was very large in size in comparison to the plane and to the stars that were out at the time. I have never seen anything like this before in my entire life.   One other note:  The object seemed to zig-zag a few times as it was moving away from us.  This was a very odd experience.;43.317;-73.577
