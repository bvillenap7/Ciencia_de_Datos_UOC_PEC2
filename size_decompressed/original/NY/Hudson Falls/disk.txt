The sky was bright blue no clouds air temp around 5 degrees. The 1st object I saw was followed in the same flight path by another about 30 to 40 seconds behind the 1st. The 2nd object was then followed by 2 disks one slightly ahead of the other. The 3rd set of objects was then followed by another disk once again 30 to 40 seconds behind, which once again was followed by the 5th disk again 30 to 40 seconds behind the 4th. No contrails were left and just north of where the objects flight path had been was a jet airliner much lower est 30,000 feet leaving a large contrail. The objects apeared to be light blue and silver and the sun glistened off them. My location is 18 miles south of Lake George NY. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
