Bright blue object explodes.;2014-07-24 04:40:00;1 minute;Bright blue object explodes. As me and my buddies drove up main st. to work we noticed a bright blue object falling at a rapid speed.  The light increased and I noticed a smoke trail behind it.  The object seemed to be burning.  I had my window rolled down and it flashed and made a very loud boom.  Not sure what exactly this is.;43.317;-73.577
