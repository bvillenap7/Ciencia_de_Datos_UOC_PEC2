Round(circular) completely illuminated object and silent.;1998-09-14 21:30:00;90 sec;Round(circular) completely illuminated object and silent. On this evening my wife and myself were enjoying our backyard when I observed an illuminated circular craft, it appeared to be spherical. It was traveling from south (buffalo) to north niagara falls at (quessing) 300 MPH. Military C-4 transports fly trainning exercises regularly from Niagara Falls AFB and I am using thier speed as reference. This object did not appear to be traveling at a high altitude, however, I have no physical reference short of the visual sharpness of the illuminated object. Specifically, this object looked like a bright pure white spherical light moving fast and completely silent. The light was abnormal, almost a pure well-defined white I can't really describe it but it was not an incandecent light source. The object continued in a lenear path for approximately 1.5 sec and turned extreemely bright then vanished. Sound crazy, but it was like it energized to warp speed or something. My wife and I both witnessed this object and we haven't seen anything since.;43.0183;-78.9591
