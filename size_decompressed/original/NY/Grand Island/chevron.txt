I just returned home from working the 3-11 shift.  Looked up on this clear, star-filled night to notice what I first thought was a star or a plane in the north sky, but it was a cluster of multi-colored flashing lights not moving.  When looking around the sky, I noticed 5 more of these identical flashing clusters, not moving.  They are at about the same height in the sky, and form a very large circle across the sky. Two more such objects are flying quickly across the sky.  I got my camera with a 500mm lens, and captured the 6 lights, kind of in the shape of a stealth fighter.  I called my friend, who lives a few miles away, and asked him to go outside and look at the sky, and he readily spotted both the still objects, as well as the rapid-flying ones. I love sky watching, and have NEVER seen anything like this. Do you have any idea? Will send photo later.;43.0183;-78.9591
