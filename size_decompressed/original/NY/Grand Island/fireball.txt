Fiery trail over Western New York sky.;2010-07-04 23:00:00;3 seconds;Firery trail over Western New York sky. While setting off consumer grade fireworks in the driveway (these were ground display type ONLY, not aerial displays)  I observed a streak of light overhead, travelling roughly from ESE to WNW, directly overhead.   This was not like similar shooting stars visible in the night sky, not a thin solid streak like a normal meteorite.   Rather it was more of a broken, flaming trail.  The color was white to silver.   There were no other people in the immediate area that were setting off fireworks, and it seemed to be too high overhead to be fireworks anyway.   The night was warm, clear and devoid of any breeze.   No source (such as a craft or other object) was visible, just the trail.;43.0183;-78.9591
