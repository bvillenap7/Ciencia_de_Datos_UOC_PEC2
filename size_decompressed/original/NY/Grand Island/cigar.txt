Cigar shaped object;2012-11-05 15:30:00;2 minutes;I am 48 yrs. old and my son is 19. I was driving north on Baseline Rd. when my son pointed up in sky and said he saw an object light up into a white orb and quickly power down.  I looked up and saw a cigar shaped object flying slowly eastward for about a minute.  It then  disappeared.  It was approximately 1000 ft high. I have no idea what it was?;43.0183;-78.9591
