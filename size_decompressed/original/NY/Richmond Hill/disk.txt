It didn't stay around too long. I was on the phone looking out the window and I see a bright red light.  I thought the light was coming from outside because there are a lot of cars and cross signs around here.  The light lasted for about 3 seconds.  The object looked round, kind of like a disk.  The light was so bright that it was beaming below the craft making the object look bigger than it actually was, kind of like a jellyfish with it's body hanging below it.  Since it happened so quick I didn't really pay as much mind to it.  About 2 minutes later I saw a clearer craft.  It was the same shape and the lights were even brighter red.  Both objects seemed far away but very visible.  The second craft kind of floated around like it didn't know where to go and then it just disappeared so fast.  It was like one minute it was there so clearly and the next it was gone.  I couldn't even follow it.  It didn't fly straight either.  It seemed pretty wobbly.;40.7015;-73.8422
