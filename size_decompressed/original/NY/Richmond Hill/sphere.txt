Bright orange black circular ufo;2020-07-04 22:15:00;5 minutes;Bright orange black circular ufo Bright orange light in black circular vehicle.  Seen twice first time was a 20 seconds.  It came back around second time it was seen longer for about five minutes.  My neighbors are lighting fire works all around, so it's not a firework and vehicle is at about 1,000 feet.  Can't be a helicopter heard no motors.  After a few minutes the bright orange light dimmed and the vehicle was out of site.  I am located in the LaGuardia Airport flight path, so it the same height of a plane, but it seemed larger than jetliner.;40.7015;-73.8422
