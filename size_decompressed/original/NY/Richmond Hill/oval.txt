That's exactly what this craft did,it opened a portal i believeÂ  it disappeared, the reason it knew something was coming and no time to fly away so it took a short cut and just went in that portal and left because within 2 minutes there were about 5 black military choppers searching at the same spot where the oval craft was hovering, they (tower control or Norad) must it caught it on Radar,i will never forget that sighting from that day couple of strange things happened and i decided then to not sky watch or anything like that again, 23 years later i have decided to go back and begin a podcast and try sky watching again and not be afraid i felt they whom ever they were,  was trying to make contact, it was that fear that kept me away, I'm no longer afraid, maybe is time to do my search And make contact.;40.7015;-73.8422
