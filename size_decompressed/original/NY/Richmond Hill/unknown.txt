As I was about to go to sleep, I heard a really loud sound, almost like a buzzing sound. Loud enough to shake the house, but people who were sleeping didn't hear it. I thought that it probably was an airplane flying low, but the sound and volume remained consistent. So I peaked out my window to see what it was.  I saw a blurry figure, and it was emitting a blue, almost white beam to the ground.  I noticed a sphere descending from the blur. As I was trying to make sense of it all, the sound stopped immediately and the light disappeared.  I thought I probably dreamed it, but my neighbor mentioned the loud sound as well without me mentioning anything about this the next day.  He was awake at that time too.;40.7015;-73.8422
