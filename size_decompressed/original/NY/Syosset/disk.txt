UFO over central long island;2008-09-14 18:00:00;8-10 minutesWhile driving;UFO over central long island While driving west bound on rte 25 I noticed an object moving south west. I am familiar with the flight patterns of planes and this was not a common pattern and planes have wings. The object was round an very dark yet it seemed shiny enough to occasionally reflect the sun. I pointed out the object to my girlfriend who happened to be the driver. We observed it while stopped at a light. It then did something I never saw any plane or manmade flying apparatus do. It stopped dead. And began to move very quickly in the opposite north western direction. We pulled into a home depot parking lot just to watch it. It began to ascend into the clouds that were to the north. Eventually it disappeared into the cloud bank. Shortly after a fast moving helicopter did pass through the exact area we saw the object.;40.8167545454545;-73.5075545454545
