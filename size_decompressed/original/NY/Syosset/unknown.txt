5 objects of an amber/orange color moving together from west to east at low altitude.;2013-11-15 22:30:00;17 minutes;5 objects of an amber/orange color moving together from west to east at low altitude. Objects were a amber/orange and somewhat round but not perfect.  There were 5 objects that were traveling in a east to west direction at a relatively low altitude.  We attempted to follow the objects as best we could but after about 10 minutes the 4  of the objects were not in sight.  The 5th object appeared to rise in the sky and dissappeared.  There was no sound from the objects at all.  My wife and I both observed these objects and could not explain what they were.  There were no flashing lights that are present on all flying craft.  I have excellent hearing and have corrected vision.  I could not make out the slightest noise coming from the objects.;40.8167545454545;-73.5075545454545
