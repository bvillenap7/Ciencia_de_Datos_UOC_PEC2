Long Island Expressway, Syosset Exit 43 - Burning Red/Orange Ferris Wheel??;2013-07-04 22:00:00;15 seconds;Long Island Expressway, Syosset Exit 43 - Burning Red/Orange Ferris Wheel ?? On the service road of the LIE Syosset exit.  Saw an orange object.  Thought it was fireworks.  Maybe 8-10 fireball ring flowing along from south to north.  It didnt look like any firework I ever saw and was not a plane or helicopter.  Looked like a giant Ferris wheel on fire.
