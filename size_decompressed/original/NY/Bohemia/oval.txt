We suspected it to be a balloon because it was going up slowly and was going leftwards in the sky(FACING AIRSPACE OF MACARTHUR AIRPORT).  So I point it out to everyone and were like what is it? It kind of looked like something far away.  Now Its very hard to explain this but it like, picked up speed rapidly, moving left, like id saying going like a mile or 2 per hour to 50 miles per hour and more.  It left our view. We were very scared. Sadly we have no proof of this other then witnesses.  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/081/S81802.html my other sightning;40.7665;-73.1216
