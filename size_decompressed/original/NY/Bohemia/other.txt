7-9 ufos captured on video, 5 mins away from airport.;2011-06-15 22:30:00;Unkown;7-9 ufos captured on video, 5 mins away from airport. I am 13 years old. I was getting a drink of water and looked out side to see 7-9 lights not blinking or making noise.  My mom was outside walking my dog and my sister was next to me.   Early this day we heard helicopters vibrating the whole entire house. I got this on video. It mainly shows 3 of them.  I got my camera rolling once they started to form a triangle.  At first it was a straight line. I live 5 minutes away from McAuther Airport.  This is NOT a joke.   Some of them were amber, some were yellow and some were plain white.  The 6 of them blocked by a tree were seeable at different angles.   I have no clue how long they were up but only lasted 5-9 minutes when I saw them.   At the time when first saw, an airline jet was passing by and flew under most of them.  I think it went under 1.  But it was hard to focus on the air crafts.  They all faded away.   Please review this. P.S- As writing this I feel vibrations in my house hold. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested a copy of the video, and a report from the mother.  PD));40.7665;-73.1216
Large orange lighted craft slowly flying over our house and making a mechanical noise that I had never heard before at 2:15am on July 2;2015-07-24 02:15:00;8 minutes;Large orange lighted craft slowly flying over our house and making a mechanical noise that I had never heard before at 2:15am on July 2 At about 2:15am on the 24th of July, 2015, my girlfriend and I woke up to an unusually loud sound in the sky.  We looked up by our bedroom window and saw the object as it went over the house low in the sky.  It was travelling at a slow, deliberate speed that was practically hovering above us.  It looked to be a large object at least the size of a jet plane yet the only lights consisted of two bright orange lights at the front and back of the object with no other lights or colors other than orange and glowing. We were suspicious of the object since we live near MacArthur Airport and planes stop landing at about 11:00pm each day.  This was 2:15am.  The size and close proximity made it a curious sight since it was low to the ground and was the size of a jet, yet a jet would have fallen from the sky at this speed.  The sound was nothing we had ever heard before, almost a grinding industrial sound but not a helicopter or a jet plane or small aircraft sound at all.;40.7665;-73.1216
