Well this was back in 2008 when me and my friend were in my backyard just messing around, and we look into the sky and see these crafts just floating through.  But they seemed friendly.  They were respectively moving around each other.  It is hard to explain.  Like if they were moving, some of them would go in front of the other and just circle each other as they flew along.  But it just seemed they were goof friends or something.  The thing about this sighting is there was noise.  You would see them vagely in the clouds but you could hear this odd, hovering sound if you would to say.  It had like a faint hovering sound that I cant explain.  We ran into my parents room where they were watching tv and they didnt beleive us by the time they looked out the window they were gone.. No proof was recorded only 1 other witness ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 2008 is approximate.  PD));40.7665;-73.1216
