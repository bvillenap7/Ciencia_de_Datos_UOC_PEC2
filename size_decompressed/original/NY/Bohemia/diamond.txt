I was at work and i was loading a van, and there was something in the top of my eye so i looked up. at first i thought it was a hummingbird that was kind of close but the longer i looked at it the more i realized it was far away. it was in a diamond shape and the top point of the diamond wasnt as long as the bottom and the bottom looked like it was spinning. there was also something on the outside, like how the wings look on a hummingbird when it's flying. once i realized what it was, i went inside to get my friend to come see it but when i got back, it was gone.
