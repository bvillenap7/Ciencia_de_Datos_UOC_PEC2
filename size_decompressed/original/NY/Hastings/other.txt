Orion’s Belt on the Move;2020-05-08 03:30:00;Seconds;Orion’s Belt on the Move I was outside smoking a cigarette and looking at the sky because I always do and it was a full-ish moon and clear.  I can always spot Orion’s Belt and when I thought I saw it one of the stars left the belt suddenly but had the same luminosity, and I thought my eyes were just playing tricks on me and then I saw the same “star” shoot off into the distance.  I’ve lived in the same place for years and debunked a lot of things.  But I know what I saw;43.3523;-76.156
