There was a light overcast of clouds in the sky.  Suddenly I looked up and witnessed three bright lights.  They were about the size of a standard room, and had mass.  They seemed to be just above the clouds.  My friends and I watched with amazement and fear as they circled each other, in sort of sporadic movements.  It was almost as if they were giving us a show.  Then two of proceeded to attach to one another, it was almost as if there was a pole connecting them.  They then pivoted around and around, and then detached.  They then kept dancing.
