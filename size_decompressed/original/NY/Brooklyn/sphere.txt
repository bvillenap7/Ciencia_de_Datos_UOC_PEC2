These were not planes because I did not see the usual flashing wingtips and they were too close in proximity to be planes.  These orbs were orange/metallic standing still.  They seemed to appear and disappear several times then seemed to rise up and totally disappear.  The location is over Canarsie/Jamaica Bay area in Brooklyn, NY.  By the time I called my son, they were gone.  I could not believe my eyes.;40.6643181479954;-73.9724466205012
