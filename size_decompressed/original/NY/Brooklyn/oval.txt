Two fast-moving black shapes;2020-07-31 18:40:00;1 min;Two fast-moving black shapes I initially thought I was watching a black bird pass by a few hundred meters away, but I realized it didn’t bob up and down like a bird would.  It had a much smoother trajectory and there were no wings.  Whatever it was was a small black dot that may have been much further away than I thought.  I couldn’t easily tell.  As I tried to puzzle out what it was—it was moving across the sky, heading west , I noticed a second one sort of below the first.  Both were obscured behind a building immediately after I saw the second one.;40.6643181479954;-73.9724466205012
