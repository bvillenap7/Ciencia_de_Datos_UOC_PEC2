Large Green and Red Flashing Lights - Low Flying Craft;2019-12-26 19:00:00;10 seconds;Large Green and Red Flashing Lights - Low Flying Craft 12/26/2019  Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, NY  At approximately 7PM I was driving down the block heading west towards the shore about two blocks east of Shore Road.  While driving I saw extremely low flying craft of a shape that I was unable to determine.  It was flashing very large green and red lights.  I thought that perhaps it had something to do with the Christmas holiday.  It was flying so low that I thought for a second that it might be a drone.  But its size was much too large for that to be the case. Since I was driving I was unable to get a clear look at it.  I thought it was a helicopter but it just didn’t seem consistent with that for a few reasons.  Firstly, the height at which it was flying and the speed at which it was moving didn’t seem like normal operations for a helicopter.  If it was a helicopter flying at that height it should have produced a fairly loud sound and I have no recollection of there being the well-known buzz of a chopper.  I was able to see it for maybe ten seconds at most, focusing on the road and glancing up to try to get a look at it.  By the time I was able to pull over, within 30 seconds tops there was no sight of it whatsoever, nor was there any residual sound. Since I witnessed this in NYC I was hoping someone else might be able to corroborate my account or got a better look at it and was able to identify what kind of craft it was.  That’s why I’ve submitted the report here.;40.6643181479954;-73.9724466205012
