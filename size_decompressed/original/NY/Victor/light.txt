A small, white light came from behind the house and flew at a good clip (but smoothly) and flew half way over the sky and just disappeared.  It looked like a large star but wasn’t high enough to be a satellite.  It didn’t appear to be higher than cloud level.  It definitely was not a plane.  It was not a shooting star in appearance.
