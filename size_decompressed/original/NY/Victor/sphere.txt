A small, white, ping-pong-like ball approached my car.;2008-10-06 22:00:00;2 minutes;A small, white, ping-pong-like ball approached my car. I was exiting the 490 East expressway at the Eastview Mall Exit 28 when I stopped at the light at the exit intersection of Route 96.  It was about ten at night and the night was clear.  The intersection is lighted brightly by the rosy bright highway lights.  It looked as if it was daylight at night.  I was the first car at the light waiting to turn left. As I looked straight ahead, I saw an object sort of hovering about four feet off the ground.  My first thought was, “Wow, what a big dragonfly!”  It was flying like and acting like a dragonfly, with the same zigzag, stop-and-go movements.  It flew toward my car, approaching the passenger side hood.  When it got this close I could see that it was a small white ball.  It looked like a ping pong ball!  It seemed to have something sticking out of it and moving, but I cannot really say what it was.  It paused near the top of my hood and then came to the passenger side window.  It stopped, “looked” at me for a second, and then continued past my car. I really felt like it saw me.  The light turned green so I turned because there was a car behind mine. I did not see where it went. I went home and told my 14 year-old son about it.  I told him it reminded me of the Quidditch ball in the Harry Potter movies. It is so unbelievable that I can’t comprehend what I saw.  It could have been some kind of probe.  Someone suggested that it could have been a toy, but this was an isolated area at night and, after seeing it up close, it did not appear to be something that has been developed yet.;42.986;-77.4139
