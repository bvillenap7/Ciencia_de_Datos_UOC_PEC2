Fast moving disck like object with red and green flashing lights.;2000-05-25 20:00:00;1 minute;Fast moving disck like object with red and green flashing lights. It was dark outside at about 8:00 at night when we arrived at my house from buying a new table. (We were getting the wood floor refinished so we had to stay in a nearby hotel). Since I was not strong enough to carry the table myself, the rest of my family had to, so I stayed outside.  When I looked up I could see all the stars possible in this area because there were no clouds at all. Then about a minute after just standing there looking at the stars and the moon. I heard a noise unlike any other I had heard before.  It seemed really quiet because it was high pitch.  It was sort of like a mechanical screech!  So I turned around to see what it was, and there Flying at about 20-30 mph about 20ft above my 60ft tall house was a disk like object.  It was about 15-20 ft across.  When it was directly over me it slowed down a little and I got a good look at it.  It was dark grey around the edge with a liter grey circle in the center.  Around the edge were flashing red and green lights. (They flashed moving in a circular counter clockwise pattern in the order of red-green-red-green) When it was finally over me it sped up again and sticking out the top was a small metal like dome.  It was flying North to North East.   When I told my family they just laughed at me and forgot about it but I know I saw it.;42.986;-77.4139
