Light over Long Island/NYC sky on New Years day.;2002-01-01 04:45:00;5min;Light over Long Island/NYC sky on New Years day. It was about 5am in the morning of 01/01/02 ... which means it was 5 hours after new years.  I was just coming home (i  was  NOT drunk) from a new years eve party and happened to see a strange light in the sky.  It was strang only because it was acending in the sky next to another aircraft which was obvisablly a airplane.  For a moment i thought the strange gliding light was also a airplane but it was asending highter and it was brighter then a airplane.  Also this object appeared to be made of light and did not blink.  When stopped acending in the sky it changed its color from a white light to a brighter yellow light.  It was in the western sky which could mean it was flying right over NYC no more then 25 miles away.  It flew in the sky at the same altiude for a few mins and then did  a small, barely noticable zig zag movement and then changed back to its org. white light color.  A min later is disapeared in the very clear night sky.  There was no sound heard, it seemed to be very far away. I dont know if this is releated but the night before i heard what i thought was a airplane over head but the sound seemed to hoover longer then an airplane would passing.  When looking out the window i still heard the sound but there was nothing i could see in the sky.;40.7305214285715;-73.6772809523811
