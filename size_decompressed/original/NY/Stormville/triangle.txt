I was outside of my house looking at the sky to see how the weather was looking when I saw a dart like triangle with red lights slowly heading east over my house.   The craft was moving very slowly and hovered once making no sound at all.   It rose into the cloud cover and disappeared.;41.5475;-73.7246
