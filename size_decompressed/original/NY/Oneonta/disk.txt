2 orange/copper colored metallic disks.;2009-07-24 20:15:00;2  1/2 seconds;2 orange/copper colored metallic disks. On Friday evening (7/24/-9) I was in the upper part of The Clinton Plaza parking lot. It had been raining with T-storms.The rain stopped but it was still cloudy. At 8:15 PM (E.S.T.) I was looking South/South-East across Market Street and the D&H Railroad when a bolt of lightning came down with two branches of lightning coming down from the main bolt. Out of these two tributary bolts popped out two metallic orange/copper colored disks that tumbled out for at least one full second then suddenly disappeared. I would say that at arms length these objects were 1/2 the size of my thumb nails.I'm guessing they were at least a mile away.I don't recall any sound from them. I swear to God these things were NOT ball lightning. These crafts both had domes on them and were all the same color as stated above. About one minute after this, a YELLOW bolt of lightning (to the left of what I had just seen) bolted UP. If anyone has ever seen what I've just described anywhere I'd sure like to hear about it. These things were obviously manufactured by some kind of intelligence.;42.4616999999999;-75.0533999999996
