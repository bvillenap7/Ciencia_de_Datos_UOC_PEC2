Strange moving, multi-colored light, not a plane satellite or star.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly the star, Sirius?  PD));2004-02-13 22:00:00;1hr.;Strange moving, multi-colored light, not a plane satellite or star. The object was spotted for the first time on 02/13/04 around 9:30pm. My girlfriend and I were sitting on my bed in my dorm room watching a movie. I took a glance out of the window and saw a strange star. I told my girlfriend to look at it and she said, I know I've been looking at it too. We studied it for a while and ruled out that it was not a star or a plane or a satellite. We were only able to look at the object through binoculars, but it was still very clear that this was no known object. The object was blinking red, white, and, blue. It looked orange at times possibly because it was blinking, or moving, extremely fast. After about a half hour of studying the object, it began to move upwards towards the right. It was moving quite fast because within an hour of wathing the object it was no longer visible. My girlfriend and I pondered on the sititng for a long time. On 02/16/04 when I returned to my girlfriend returned to my college to visit me for a few days we saw the object for a second time. It was noticed around the same time, about 10:00pm, in the same spot. It also began to move upwards towards the right until it was out of sight, again. My girlfriend asked me if I had seen it at all since the last time we saw it and I told her no because I hadn't. Also, the object did not follow the pattern of the orbit of the earth.

Two lights traveling at a high rate of speed;2004-02-23 20:56:00;30 seconds;Two lights traveling at a high rate of speed I am a frequent night observer of planes, etc in the sky. I have never seen anyting like this in the past but I cant say for sure that it was one single object. I was looking at the sky (South, South East) at approximately 8:56 pm EST when I saw two rapidly pulsating lights just appear - approximately 3 inches apart in the sky. These lights were pulsating in a sequence of 3 rapid bursts, a slight pause, and then 3 more rapid bursts. Most air craft are displaying a regular and consistant blinking of the light. The intersting part of this is that the lights maintained the exact same distance apart (from my perspective) during the entire time they traveled thru my field of vision ( my field of vision was quite large ). The speed at which they were traveling seemed much faster than the average air craft. If, in fact this was one object traveling thru the sky, it must have been moving at an increadable rate of speed and must have been extremely large.;42.4616999999999;-75.0533999999996
