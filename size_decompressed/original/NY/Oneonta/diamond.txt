Diamond-shaped object with 4 blinking lights very high;2002-09-03 00:35:00;3 Minutes;Diamond-shaped object with 4 blinking lights very high Just after 12:35am EST on 9/3/02 in Oneonta, NY, I saw a blinking light in the sky... it was travelling West to East in the North sky, basically in line with the Milky Way... there was no noise, it seemed very high, and it was moving at a moderate pace... I had someone grab me a pair of binoculars, and I saw that it had 4 blinking lights, although they never blinked at the same time, and there didn't seem to be a pattern to the blinking. The positions of the lights on the craft seemed to form a diamond, with one light on what appeared to be the front.  I could not see any shape to it, only the lights when they blinked.  I lost it in my binocualrs soon after, but it seemed to just vanish... I'm pretty sure I didn't just lose it, it seemed like the lights stopped blinking, and when I put down the binoculars I could not see it anymore. Maybe it was a military craft or something else, but I'm pretty sure it was not a satellite, nor a passenger plane. Please help if you have any ideas!;42.4616999999999;-75.0533999999996
