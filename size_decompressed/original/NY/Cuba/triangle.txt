The only sound we heard was idling of trucks at the rest area. The object was not high up, it was cloudy and we watched as the object slowly started to disappear into a cloud bank. The shape of the formation was triangular. Lights were fairly large and diffuse (did not look like searchlights or conventional sources of light-did not cast a beam) and they were white. The lights numbered about 5 or 6 on each leg/side of the triangle, the triangle was open ended.;42.1904;-78.2796
