Stationary Pulsing White Lights in the Night Sky;2007-02-14 19:00:00;5-10 mins;Stationary Pulsing White Lights in the Night Sky On the way home from dinner my boyfriend and I noticed strange white pulsing lights in the night sky. These lights were stationary as we drove along the highway and they would dim and get brighter at a couple points dimming out to complete darkness and then reappearing again in the same exact place. The lights appeared to be under the cloud line. As the passenger, I continued to watch the lights for about 5-10 mins until they disappeared completely.;42.1904;-78.2796
