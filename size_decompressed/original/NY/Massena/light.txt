While driving down route 37 just outside of Massena, NY, past Akwasasne, I witnessed what I believe to be some sort of flying object of light.  It was about 25-3500’ off the ground.  The sun was off the left of time and it was reflecting almost a brighter glare than what the sun could make.  The object was dead ahead and moving left to right and would make more of a glare the longer I stared at it. It was to low and to big to be a commercial airliner in the air.  There were a few other cars on the road but heading in the opposite direction.  I went down to grab my phone to take a video of it and when I looked back up it was gone.  I couldn’t find it at all.  I stopped scanned all around.  Nothing.  It was gone.;44.9322000000001;-74.8845000000001
