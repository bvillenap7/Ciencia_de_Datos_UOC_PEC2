White cylinder seen in Massena, New York.;2017-02-18 16:00:00;20 minutes;White cylinder seen in Massena, New York. On our way home from the store, my friend and I thought we saw a ufo.  It was a bright white cylinder. It was going pretty fast and disappeared a few times.  When we got to the house, I tried to get a picture with my phone, but it couldn't zoom in enough.  I went in the house to get my camera, but it was gone by the time I got back.  In the same area, there was now what looked like a star, but it elongated into a cylinder, then two stars.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks because its the same location of the north star.  I figure it may have just appeared to be doing these things.   did take a picture and it is a cylinder.  Not from camera movement because nothing else has motion blurs in the photo.;44.9322000000001;-74.8845000000001
