Triangular aircraft with blue and white lights seen by 3 in upstate NY.;2013-08-12 21:30:00;seconds;Triangular aircraft with blue and white lights seen by 3 in upstate NY. We witnessed a UFO coming home from the casino on Monday August 12th around 9:30 pm.  This aircraft flew right above the front windshield of our car probably no more then 200 feet in the sky.  It was triangular in shape but gave off no noise or vibration leading us to believe it could possibly be a plane or man made craft.   We do not know what this aircraft was or were it came from but it scared all of us who were in the car.   The craft had a bright white light in each corner and a dimmer blue light in the middle.   The aircraft was heading towards the St. Lawrence sea way were there is a large power dam.;44.9322000000001;-74.8845000000001
