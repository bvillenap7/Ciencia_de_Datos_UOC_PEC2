Large quiet craft,  moving at a very low altitude, heading east over Suffolk County, New York.;1975-10-15 18:00:00;3 minutes;Large quiet craft,  moving at a very low altitude, heading east over Suffolk County, New York. During the fall of 1975, for some reason I can't remember the exact date, my daughter was coming home on the late bus from basketball practice so I went out on my front porch to watch her walk home from the bus stop.  Our home was across the street from a cul-de-sac and this very large circular object approached our home from that direction.  My husband and son joined me and all witnessed this enormous, silent, craft with many lights on it's underside, slowly drift over us and proceed eastward.  We didn't live far from the Islip McArthur Airport so after the craft passed over us I ran inside and called the F.A.A. and reported the sighting.  Later on that night I heard on the radio that over 100,000 people on Long Island had seen the craft and had called in to various radio stations, police departments, etc.  The next day our local newspapers ran something about a weather balloon being spotted.  For reasons I can't explain, neither my husband nor I discussed this incident with anyone for many years.  I have tried, unsuccessfully, to verify newspaper reports of this incident, or see anything on any of the U.F.O. sites or T.V. shows on U.F.O. sightings, to corroborate this sighting.  I would appreciate any suggestions you could give me on where I can look up this informationn. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));40.8437;-73.1404
