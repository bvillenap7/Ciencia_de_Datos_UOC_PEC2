Using my cell phone I started to take several pictures to share them with friends and family.  I started taking the pictures facing the south and then kept moving until I was facing the east portion of the parking lot. Later on, while I was showing these images to my friend, we noticed these lights that appeared to be in the clouds, several and on different exposures.  There is no airport adjacent to the area, neither any towers that would explain the normal existence for these lights.;40.8771;-73.0885
