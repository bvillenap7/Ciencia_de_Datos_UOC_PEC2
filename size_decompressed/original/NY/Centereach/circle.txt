Two lights over Centereach, NY, during a storm.;2012-07-26 19:00:00;7 minutes;Two lights over Centereach, NY, during a storm. I just wanted to send a picture or two that were taken on 7/26/12 at the start of a bad storm that came through Centereach NY.  These pictures were taken by a co-worker.  I wanted to see if someone could verify that they are real. I ’m sure they are.  I don’t think this guy is the type of person to try and fake a picture.  I really think they are real.  Picture 12 is the best one, if you zoom in you will see 2 lights each with a circle around it and what looks like 2 smaller lights on either side.   Can you let me know if you think they are real or not?   Thank you.  ((name deleted));40.8771;-73.0885
