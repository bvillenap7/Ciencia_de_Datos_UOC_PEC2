I'M SURE OF WHAT I SAW.;2014-12-25 21:30:00;1 minute;I'M SURE OF WHAT I SAW. I WAS DRIVING HOME ON NICHOLS ROAD AT APROX 9:30 PM. WHEN I SAW 2 BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHTS TO THE LEFT OF MY WINDSHIELD.  THEY APPEARED TO BE ON FIRE AND I THOUGHT AT FIRST I WAS WITNESSING A TRADGEDY.  UNTIL THEY KEPT FLYING.   THEY WERE A FEW THOUSAND FEET ABOVE MY CAR MOVING EAST.  THERE WERE TWO OF THEM AT FIRST AND THEN A THIRD APPEARED ABOUT TWO TO THREE HUNDRED FEET BEHIND AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE OTHER TWO.  TRAILING BEHIND.   THE OBJECT LOOKED LIKE A BULLET WITH SOME SORT OF EXHAUST IN THE BACK, ALMOST LIKE A ROCKET.  IT WAS DEFINITELY BRIGHT ORANGE AND LOOKED ON FIRE.;40.8771;-73.0885
