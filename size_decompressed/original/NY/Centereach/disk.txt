Centereach, Long Island, NY, 1977 or 1978, Red disk shaped object hovering in Northern direction;1978-07-16 21:00:00;4 minutes;Centereach, Long Island, NY, 1977 or 1978, Red disk shaped object hovering in Northern direction Centereach, NY (Long Island, Suffolk County) TO the best of my recollection, it was an evening around 9 pm in or around the summer of 1977 or 1978.  I was looking out my bedroom window which faces north.  It was a clear night.  I noticed a red disk shaped object hovering in the distance North-North East from my position.  It was stationary for approximately one minute then moved slowly left for a short distance before stopping and hovering again.  I don't remember if the object shifted in color but I am sure it was primarily red, flickering at times.  There was absolutely no resemblence to a helicopter or airplane I was convinced it was not our ordinary aircraft.  After another minute or so the objecty slowly ascended straight up until it was out of my line of sight.  It is hard for me to estimate the size of the object.  As far as its distance from me, I would guess it was at least 1/2 mile away, towards the direction of Port Jefferson.  In my opinion, this was definately an unidentified flying object.
