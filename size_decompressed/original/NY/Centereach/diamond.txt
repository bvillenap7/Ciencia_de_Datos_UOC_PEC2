The object was diamond shaped, and flashed several different colors in a rapid manner.  I have never seen any aircraft flash lights that fast before.  It moved at a medium speed across the night sky and dipped down to a low altitude and went past a large group of trees, then it turned at a 90 degree angle and headed in that direction passed our sight of view.  I have never seen anything like that, and we have seen many aircraft passing by in the view of our sky light window, but this was one that we couldn't identify or classify as a typical airplane or know aircraft.;40.8771;-73.0885
