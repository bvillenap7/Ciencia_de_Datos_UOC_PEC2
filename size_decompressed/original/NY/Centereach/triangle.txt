Triangle shaped object hovering over selden and coram area, very low and bright.;2003-12-28 23:10:00;8-9min aprox;Triangle shaped object hovering over selden and coram area, very low and bright. well It was getting late sunday night and i was at a friends house in centereach, i dont drive so he was giving me a ride back to my house in coram. so we took nicolls rd up to middle country rd to go east to coram, when we got on to middle country rd i saw a bright light south east of us not moving, i pointed it out to my friend and he said it was prob a helicopter.So we were driving east and i still kept my eye on it and when we got to selden i can see the object a lil better and it was not moving at all so i thought it was a chopper hovering looking for someone. so we passed over north ocean ave and getting into coram about a mile and a half from Rt112 and i saw it getting brighter but still in the same position, i pointed it out to my friend and we started to get a lil nervous cuz it seem to start moving towards the road so we passed 112 and i lost sight of the object, about 6 sec after we passed Rt112 i looked behind us and was tho object bout 3/4 of a mile away from us and about 1500 to 1800 feet high behind the tree line,the object made no sound what so ever! so i told my friend to pull over in the parking lot about a 1/4 mile ahead so we did but we lost sight of the object for a few more sec when we pulled into the parking lot we saw it about 2 miles away from us. it looked like a triangle with 3 lights at each tip and one light in the middle, so we observed this object for about 30 more sec it looked like it rotated 90 degrees and took on a Y shape and faded away. Ok now when i saw the object before we pulled into the parking lot it was so close to us i actually got scared, and when i lost sight of it for that 6 sec till we got into the lot it must of flew 2 miles in 6 seconds to where it was when we saw it again.;40.8771;-73.0885
