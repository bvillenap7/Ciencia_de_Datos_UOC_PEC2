Spinning silver object seen by two on a clear summer night.;2021-08-05 19:18:00;5-6 minutes;Spinning silver object seen by two on a clear summer night. On the night of August 5th 2021 at approximately 7:15 pm eastern time my wife and I observed a round spinning object in the distance from our front porch. It was whitish/silver and spinning and reflecting the sunlight against a clear blue sky. It was stationary then appeared to move to the right then up and then back to the right and then slowly move up and finally out of our sight. This occurred for several minutes. It did not behave like a ballon in that it was not moving in a predictable or stable fashion.it would float then move slightly and then move either in an upward or sideways pattern as this night was clear and not a windy one. It seemed to move in a casual manner. It did not resemble a drone device as it was very high in the skyline and it's being a large  bright and reflective and the whole object seemed to spin.;40.7326;-73.0935
