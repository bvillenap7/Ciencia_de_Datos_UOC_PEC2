((HOAX??))  Cloaked UFO making noises and pink flashing lights on february 18th.;2008-02-18 01:30:00;15 seconds;Cloaked UFO making noises and pink flashing lights on february 18th. Ok every day, once a day, at random times, I hear a noise that sounds like a hovercraft or something that is hovering above my house me and my brother both hear it I hear it more often though because I never really have any music on.  Anyways the reason I think this might be a ufo is because one night Febraury 18th 2008 at aproximatly 1:30 am at night it was storming out and because of the storm I think the cloak (yes I do beleive that it is cloaked) was disrupted causeing my power to go out.  Me and my brother both seen pink flashing lights him being on the left side of the house me being on the right. There were no cars around and everyone was sleeping.  After it left the electric went back on and we had no communication with anyone so we couldn't find out if it happened to anyone else.  The next day, February 19th, 2008 at aproximatly 10 am we got our communication back and I went online and asked people who lived near me if they had lost power or seen anything like what we saw and everyone I asked said no. Please respond to this cause this is a true story and I do hear something hovering above my house once a day at random times. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax.  Indicates date in 2009.
