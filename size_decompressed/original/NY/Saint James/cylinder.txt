It was moving extremly fast and seemed to stop on a dime and make right angle turns without slowing down or changing altitude. after observing this four about a minute it seemed to let out other objects also with lights but these objects were smaller in size then the original one there were three objects now. It was very odd to see it fly there were about 60 lights on all three of them like 20 on each they were blinking very fast and were power full to look at.It did not make any noise as it flew across the night sky but im am pretty sure that there was five minutes of unexplained time loss.;40.8833;-73.1597
