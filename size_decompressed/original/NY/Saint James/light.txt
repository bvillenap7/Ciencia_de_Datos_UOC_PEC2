Fast moving green light.;2019-01-20 23:15:00;2 seconds;Fast moving green light. Hello Mr Davenport,  I had the pleasure of listening to you on the Ground Zero podcast from last week.  Your interview persuaded me to look up your website and report something seen several days ago (prior to my hearing the broadcast).  I am reporting on behalf of my son.  I was with him at the time but he was the only person who saw the actual occurrence.  He is an adult and responsible. We were looking out of our home our windows  to view the blood moon. My son looked out towards the south west and he saw a green light moving very quickly. the path direction was either moving away from us, further to the SW, or from high in sky, diagonally from upper left to lower right, down towards Horizon. He claimed it was faster than meteors we have seen in the past. There was no tail, no flare, nor change in the brightness of the light. It was lime green and somewhat blurry. We believe it was a far distance away based on my conversation with him.  He also denies that it was a drone. Perhaps it was a meteor but it didnâ€™t have those usual features and he seemed shocked to have seen it .;40.8833;-73.1597
