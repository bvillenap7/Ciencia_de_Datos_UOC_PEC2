The size of the light would be about the size of your pointer finger-nail at arms length. The light was sitting still but was impossible to tell the distance or brightness, it could have been close and relativity dim, or it could have been high up and very bright.  the ufo was completely silent. After watching it for a few minutes i went outside to get a different perspective of the light but when i got out there the light was moving east.  i followed it as far as i could but i still have no clue what it was. I know what planes and satellites look like in the nights sky and this was far far brighter than either.;42.676;-77.581
