Started with a green fireball followed by flashing lights in the sky then complete power outage and object was gone;2016-04-29 23:45:00;20 minutes;Started with a green fireball followed by flashing lights in the sky then complete power outage and object was gone At approximately 11:45pm while traveling north on the palisades parkway near exit 11, I witnessed a green fireball light up the sky which disappeared as soon as it came… Then at approximately midnight, while traveling North on 45 between Spring Valley and Pomona my wife and i witnessed flashing in the sky which seemed to be cloud covered or had a haze around it.  We drove along following this which happened to be the same direction as our way home. The flashing was inconsistent, and varied in color. There was nothing obstructing us from seeing this.  No trees or buildings around.  There was nothing below the haze and flashing or above.  I pulled into our complex (Buckingham Court in Pomona NY) and i stopped to take about a 30 second video of this. At which point i pulled into my parking spot.  It seemed to be almost directly over our house… We heard a humming noise for about 30 seconds.  At the exact moment i shut my car off the entire power in the complex wen! t out.  There was complete darkness and the flashing and haze in the sky was gone.  Power went back on at 1:35am...  Will email video along with this explanation.;41.1893;-74.0432
