Was in the basement with my sister.  We ran upstairs and looked out the sliding glass door with my mom.  We witnessed a dark black floating saucer with only 3 VERY BRIGHT color changing spot lights on the bottom of the saucer slowly descended towards the ground and landed for 10 seconds.   Right after is shot up to the sky extremely fast in one direction spinning like a Frisbee.  NO LOUD NOISES.  NO CRAZY WIND.  I randomly was talking to my boyfriend and he made me do this in case something can be done with it in any way shape and form.;41.744;-74.1067
