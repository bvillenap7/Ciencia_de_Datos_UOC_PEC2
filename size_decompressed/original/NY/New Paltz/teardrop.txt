Object appeared to be white-ish silver moving SSW at high speed (I was driving 55 mph), flying low enough to observe no wings of any kind.  Appeared to be teardrop shaped with point facing direction of travel, no lights but did observe glint of light from Sun reflecting off surface of object indicating it was a solid, reflective mass.  That part of Rt. 32 has trees on both sides, object clearly visible while following road then became obscured by trees.  turned onto Horesenden Road, observed once through trees when turned onto road then lost.  Did not see again once tree line ended and had more visible area to observe.;41.744;-74.1067
