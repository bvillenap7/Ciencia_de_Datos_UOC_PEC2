Dark matte, wedge-shaped craft AM radio interference.;2014-02-06 17:17:00;~15 seconds;Dark matte wedge-shaped craft AM radio interference I witnessed a single, dark matte, wedge-shaped craft moving rapidly from nearly due north to NNE at 1717 hrs.  Altitude was approximately 2000 ft., and distance was approximately 250 ft. I live north of Stewart Int'l Airport (formerly Stewart AFB) so have grown up seeing experimental military aircraft.  This vehicle, however, had a wobbling or warping effect as it crossed in front of me.  I thought for a moment that a protrusion had possibly unrolled on the craft directly toward my eye, but as the craft moved past, I could see no change in its profile.  The effect remained for the very brief time the vehicle was in sight.  It affected the entire side of the craft, but I was unable to see if it extended above or below.  There was no evidence of exhaust behind the craft. The vehicle was moving very rapidly at a low altitude for this area.  AM radio had several bursts of high-speed Morse-like code on lower bands.  It was followed several minutes later by several choppers in the same direction, too high to make out any features other than that they were dark (not typical light-colored medevac helicopters of this area).;41.744;-74.1067
