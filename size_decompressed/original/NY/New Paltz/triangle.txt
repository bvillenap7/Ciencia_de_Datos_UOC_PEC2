Black Triangular Aircraft w/ Three White Lights Flying Low in New Paltz, NY;2010-01-05 17:43:00;45 seconds;Black Triangular Aircraft w/ Three White Lights Flying Low in New Paltz, NY At 17:42 EST I was in my car driving west-bound on Rt. 299 (Main St) into New Paltz, New York.  I was approaching the intersection of Rt. 32 South and Main Street (right before you enter the village, near the Rite Aid Plaza right before you go up the small hill) when out the window to my left  I saw 3 white lights in a triangle form in the sky.  It appeared that the three lights were attached to some sort of triangular shaped object.  Two of the lights were blinking and were brighter than the third light. The lights were on the 3 points of the triangle. The triangular object was very close to being equilateral and it seemed that there was definitely a slim, black object of some sort in between the three lights.  In terms of size, the craft was about 1 and 1/4 Full Moons in size.   At first glance, I thought the object was not moving at all, but as I continued to watch it while driving, I realized it was moving very very slowly eastward. It was difficult to tell how far from the ground it was, but when I first saw it, I thought it was a low-flying plane--it was probably about 1000 feet from the ground.   I was about to lose sight of it, so I took a left hoping to see it from a different angle.  However, after I turned I complete lost sight of it. I quickly drove back to where I had originally seen it (I was only on the other street for about a minute) but it was gone. I have never seen anything like it before.  Although I only witnessed the sight for a total of about 35-50 seconds, it was very bizarre to see.;41.744;-74.1067

It a clear dark sky, and we spotted two triangular crafts, with three bright lights, in the center a white light with a red light on one side and a blue light on the other.   Then six more crafts appeared in the northeast sky each flying a distance from each other they were moving slowly and steady towards the south.    They moved without making any sounds.  Also, in the sky we sighted a orb like image, whitish in color. ((NUFORC Note:  Date was flawed.  We have amended it to reflect a sighting on January 16, 2017.  PD));41.744;-74.1067
