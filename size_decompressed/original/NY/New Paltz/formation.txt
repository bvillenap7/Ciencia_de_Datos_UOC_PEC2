7-9 lights crossing the sky in a haphazard formation.;2017-03-21 22:45:00;10 seconds;7-9 lights crossing the sky in a haphazard formation. Stepping outside of my home tonight I approached the backyard and peering at the sky saw seven to nine lights moving across the sky in formation.  When I sighted the objects they were high in the southern sky, they moved northward changing formations changing from a line formation to a V with objects weaving in and out of each other and disorganized at times.  The light emitted by the objects was a gently pulsating white light.  As they continued northward I noticed a commercial jet in the distance, appearing to be ahead of the formation.  It was then that the objects disappeared from sight completely.  Around one minute later I saw another object of similar size and appearance cross the sky in the same direction, also disappearing.  They were silent.;41.744;-74.1067
