stationary flashing object high in sky;2001-04-23 21:30:00;15 minutes;stationary flashing object high in sky when my wife and i were walking out of our house i looked up in the sky. on clear nights i always look at the stars. i saw what looked like a star but it was flashing on and off. at first i thought it was a light of an airplane. then after a few minutes i realised that it wasnt moving and there was no sound. the light was high in the sky so it couldnt have been the top of a tower. the event lasted for 15 minutes. i ran to get my video camera but my batteries were dead. i tried to point it out to my wife but her eyes are not the best and she couldnt see where i was pointing. i know this was something unusual because what flashes on and off in the sky but doesnt move up or down or sideways. the light was faint and resembled a star when it was on. it was not a flickering star. the object clearly went on and off steadly. this is not related to this story but i reported a web sight www.area51.com to aol. this websight was blacked out. i managed to pull up a send mail page and it was addressed to area51 for aliens to report themselves to. i wrote to this address saying i was an alien reporting to them. i have not been able to pull up this address since.
