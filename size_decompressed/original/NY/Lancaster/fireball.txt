And I saw seven to eight objects in the sky, they were floating ever so gently and I was spellbound.  They were like an amber color and sort of round but a definite shape could not be held because of the beautiful glow.   I ran for my parents and they came out to see the fading out and complete disappearance of these strange but wonderful objects.;42.9101999999992;-78.6624999999997
Silent Orange/red fireballs coming from the south and became smaller as they moved away;2012-11-16 23:38:00;5 minutes;Silent Orange/red fireballs coming from the south and became smaller as they moved away Totally silent fireballs rising from the south horizon.    At least 7 of them, but not all at once.   At they rose higher in the sky, they became smaller, until we realized they were losing their brightness as they were moving farther away.   At one point, they stopped in the same spot in the sky (we actually have an airplane beacon behind our house out in the field).  They all eventually went in different directions in the sky.   There were airplanes in the sky in the distance and at one point, it looked like the plane and object came very close.    My husband saw them first after taking the dog outside and than called us out to look.   My 14 year old son and my 11 year old daughter were also witnesses.   Lasted for approximately 5 minutes or so.  I would imagine that we weren't the only ones to see the objects.  Buffalo International airport is only about 3 miles away.;42.9101999999992;-78.6624999999997
Glowing orange lights in the sky.;2012-11-19 22:31:00;2 minutes;Glowing orange lights in the sky. Took the dog outside and noticed a small orange glow of light in the tree lines that started moving up and closer.  I called my husband outside and he watched it too as it got brighter and closer towards us.  He noted that it didn't look very high and not that far away from us.  Almost right above the airplane beacon that is in the fields behind our house.    It eventually lost its glow and faded out.   It is hazy outside tonight but we can see some stars but are hazy.  I saw another glow of light in the trees and ran and got my phone and took video.  By than another ball of light rose from the trees and rose in the sky, but not as close as the first one.  They eventually faded away.  These are the same type of lights that we saw on Friday night, although the ones that evening rose from the tree line from a different direction and was actually a fireball.;42.9101999999992;-78.6624999999997
