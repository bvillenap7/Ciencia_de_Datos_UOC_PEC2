Seen looking eastward.  Object appeared to rise up from behind a distant line of trees, hovered shakily in the sky for maybe 2 minutes in the same spot, then appeared to move rather quickly off towards the east/northeast, getting smaller and eventually disappearing into the dark.  There were 4 planes in view while this occured so it definitely was not an airplane.  At first as it rose up, it looked like an illuminated hot air balloon.;42.9101999999992;-78.6624999999997
