Well...I never thought I would admit to this...but here it goes.  I was sitting on the back steps of my house on a partly cloudy day.  It was around 2:00 in the afternoon when I noticed a silver ball, very tiny, just hanging in the sky.  The reflection of the sun off the object caught my eye.  I sat and watched it trying to determine what it was.  I kept squinting to try and see it better.  It looked as though it was stationary as the clouds were slowly moving East.  My first thought was it was a runaway balloon.  But when it was not moving with the wind...it had to be something else.  Then without warning and with no sound at all, it took off in a straight line...it's tragectory North to South at a slight incline.  The velocity was phenominal.  It went through the cumulous clouds and passed over my house.  No vapor, no sound, very fast.  If I were to guess it's size...I might have to say around the size of a Volkswagen Beetle.  That's my story...that's the truth...take it or leave it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));42.9101999999992;-78.6624999999997
