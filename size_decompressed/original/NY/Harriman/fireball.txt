Fireball streaking across the sky over I-87 NY thruway between exits 16-17 at approximately 6:30 pm on 2/7/14.;2014-02-07 18:30:00;2 seconds;Fireball streaking across the sky over I-87 NY thruway between exits 16-17 at approximately 6:30 pm on 2/7/14. Was driving south on I-287 on the NY State thruway between exits 16-17 at approximately 6:30 pm, when my wife and I both spotted a fireball streaking through the sky traveling east - west.  It lasted 1-2 seconds and then disappeared.  It was quite large and looked like a comet.  There were many vehicles traveling on both sides of the thruway so we must not be the only people who saw it.  West Point Military academy is nearby so that may help explain.;41.3005;-74.1249
