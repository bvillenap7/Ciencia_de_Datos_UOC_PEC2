Gigantic white teardrop plunges into Cayuga Lake, Ithaca, NY in late July, 2000.;2000-07-30 20:20:00;00:00:10;Gigantic white teardrop plunges into Cayuga Lake, Ithaca, NY in late July, 2000. While in the process of moving and packing a truck, I glanced up (in a direction NNW from my location) and saw a huge white teardrop shaped object plunge earthward (it appeared to plunge into Cayuga Lake) in a split-second.  Nobody near me observed this, and I have no clue as to what it might be.  I am a programmer and database specialist, and am not prone to imagining such things.  Did anyone else in Ithaca see this event??? If anyone else saw this, please enter the sighting here, just for public access.  Thank you very much. ((NUFORC Note:  the date may be approximate.
