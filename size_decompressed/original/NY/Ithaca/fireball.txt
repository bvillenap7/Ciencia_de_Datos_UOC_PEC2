Gigantic body in space appears to blow up and dim several times.;2004-04-19 21:10:00;10 minutes;Gigantic body in space appears to blow up and dim several times. My daughter and son-in-law came in from walking the dog saying there is a comet, come out and see.  I ran out to join them, and over the next few minutes we watched as a huge body, which seemed to be in space, grew so large and bright that we thought there was a meteor coming right at us.  It grew very dim, then flared nearly as bright as it had been.  It seemed to be exploding at intervals.  It did this several times until it seemed to get totally dim.  At that time we went inside.    This object appeared MUCH larger than any of the stars or planets.  I would not be surprised if we were viewing a Nova, a star blowing up.  It was absolutely gigantic.  We are supposing that reports of THIS actually WILL appear in the news media.    There was no sound, no colors, and nothing else but the explosions of brilliant light.
