While out on the patio of my friends apartment I looked up and for about 4 or 5 seconds saw a very large football field shaped object that looked fiery in form. Its colors mixed between orange, red, and white.  It levitated high in the sky miles between Lake Cayuga and Cornell University and over route 13.   It appeared out of nowhere and was still for a moment, it zipped straight down, hovered, and sped off leaving a light trail.  I am in shock and awe.;42.4444195298375;-76.4925479204328
