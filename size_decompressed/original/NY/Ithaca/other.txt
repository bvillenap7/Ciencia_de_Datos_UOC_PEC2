A extremly huge object flew across the sky with great speed and no sound.;1993-01-10 00:30:00;10 Seconds;A extremly huge object flew across the sky with great speed and no sound. A very huge object flew across the sky above 10000 ft. Its length appeared to be more than a mile long. The object was as dark as the sky, all I could see was many of its small dim lights on its edge. The object had a irregular shape, sort like a fat letter T. It traveled with a great speed. The object flew acrossed the entire sky within about 10 seconds. It spined slowly with rate about 10RPM. The huge object was extremly quiet. I didn't hear any sound! Here is an approximated shape of the object: . . . .       . .         . .         . .           . . . .  . . . .             . . .                               . .                               . .                              . . . . . . . .                . .               . .             . .         . .  .;42.4444195298375;-76.4925479204328

One big V shaped object blinking white, red and blue at a stand still with random movements - multiple objects as well.;2010-11-12 00:00:00;Roughly 1 hour;One big V shaped object blinking white, red and blue at a stand still with random movements - multiple objects as well. My girlfriend and I were taking our dogs out to use the bathroom when we noticed a couple of strange things in the sky. There were 2 medium sized bright white lights sitting in low points in the sky, multiple (at least 4) very small red flashing lights that would fly around those points (one shooting straight up into the sky very fast, one circled around one of those points, one shot to the right and we could not see it anymore, and the other one randomly flying beside the points)  There was one considerably bigger bright light that would flash from white to red to blue. That one was in the shape of a V, the others were too small to tell but if I had to guess I would say they were circular. The V shaped object would orbit and would sit in this one point in the sky while randomly moving either side to side or up and down. It would be still, then move side to side, then be still, then move again, and so on and so forth.  We sat and watched this for a little over an hour until going inside. There were stars out, however those were definitely not stars considering they moved. We are unsure if perhaps they are some sort of low flying government sattelites or possibly UFO's.  Definitely going to check again tonight and will report again if we see anything, we also took a 3 minute video of it. The weird part is that in the video it seems farther than it was when we were looking at it and the colors seem more apparent. I doubt a plane would sit still for that long.....The V shaped object is the only one you can see in the video also.;42.4444195298375;-76.4925479204328
