Triangle With USAF in Grey on Black on Underside of Fuselage;2004-05-11 23:30:00;5 min;Triangle With USAF in Grey on Black on Underside of Fuselage I live in Cayuga Hts., Just North of Ithaca. Last night a triangle shape UFO which was an equlateral triangle of maybe 150 feet on each side just stopped over my Ford Crown Victoria when I was stopped at a stop sign on Tompkins Road. It had 3 whitish lights, one at each vertex. My 1997 Crown Vic is an ex-police cruiser with a spotlight controlled from the driver's seat. I shined the spotlight on the bottom of the triangle and saw USAF in Grey on Black on the underside of the triangle at each vertex. The USAF was dark grey on black just about at each vertex. After about 10 seconds I took off from the stop sign and the triangle just disappeared. There was an almost imperceptible humming sound associated with the triangle.;42.4444195298375;-76.4925479204328

We were amazed by them, until we saw a bright white V shaped movement off in the distance. It seemed almost like a ghost, moving slower than a shooting star, but much faster than a cloud.;42.4444195298375;-76.4925479204328
Right at that time part of our lights went out in the house.... Not all, Just in the living room the tv went dark.;2020-09-28 22:00:00;ongoing;Right at that time part of our lights went out in the house.... Not all, Just in the living room the tv went dark. We saw the craft lit up, above Danby Road, looking from the west side of Danby Rd. toward the east. The object hovers on the same spot 8 minutes after we spotted it. It may be a star, but does not look exactly like one. It hangs just south of Longview Senior Center and Ithaca College The shap looks linear, but that may be because of the light beams, just like a star. It is not moving from its spot, so maybe just a star. Not obscured though, by the clouds.;42.4444195298375;-76.4925479204328
