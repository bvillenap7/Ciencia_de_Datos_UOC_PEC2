It seemed as if the object was five to ten miles away and it was larger than a plane would be and oblong.  I immediately leaned forward and watched in confusion and amazement as the object flew across the sky from south to north finally disappearing behind clouds, lighting up the clouds from behind before it disappeared.  The whole sighting only lasted ten or twenty seconds but it was quite remarkable.  The next day I was happy to see that the local paper.   The Ithaca Journal, had a small article reporting that many others had reported seeing this. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
