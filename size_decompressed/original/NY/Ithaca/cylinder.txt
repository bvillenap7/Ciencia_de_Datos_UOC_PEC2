Cylinder crosses sky without any vapor trail.;2002-01-26 15:30:00;3 minutes;Cylinder crosses sky without any vapor trail. We were walking in a park and watched a cylindrical shaped object, thus (oooovoooo), with a darker patch in the center, cross the sky without any vapor trail whatsoever.  Every jet or aircraft I have ever seen has always had at least some kind of exhaust trail.  This had absolutely none.  It was a very clear day here, and the craft seemed very high, but was large enough to still be clearly visible in shape.  At no time were wings seen at all.
