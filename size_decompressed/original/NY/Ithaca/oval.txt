Three oval objects with the one in the middle much larger and brighter flying fast in a diagonal pattern.;2005-06-18 23:50:00;2 minutes;Three oval objects with the one in the middle much larger and brighter flying fast in a diagonal pattern. Approximate date: 6/18/05 Approximate time: 23:50 I was driving headed west and noticed 3 lights coming from my left side (from the south-west) somewhat low on the horizon. I first noticed the two smaller lights, they could have been redish in color, they were moving fast and in a diagonal pattern. When I had a more unobstructed view I then saw thata perhaps a purposeful diagonal flight pattern was being maintained and then noticed the large white bright oval shaped object flying between them. That one was much larger and brighter than the other two. They were moving fast, kept the same pattern and were staying low on the horizon. By the time I turned right onto West Haven Road which runs north, I could only get a glimpse now and then of the bright white object by looking to my left through the gaps in the trees and houses. My first impluse was to follow them, but they seemed to maybe be going lower and would be hard to see unless I changed my direction to head west. When I reached my house and exited my SUV I did not here any noise to indicate planes or jets were flying close by. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.
