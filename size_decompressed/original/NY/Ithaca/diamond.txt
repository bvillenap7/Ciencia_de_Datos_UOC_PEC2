Approximately an hour or so into the movie my eyes wondered into the sky and that is when I noticed the anomaly.  The best way I can describe what I saw was a diamond shape configuration of lights going from  a diamond shape to a flat line in a way that I would describe as similar to a jellyfish.  It looked somewhat like it was swimming I would say.  Another observation that I had about what I saw was that the anomaly seemed to have a path of trajectory but it did not stay on one fixed axis.  In other words, it was going up, down, left and, right freely.  I canâ€™t identify what it was that I saw but I know that what I saw was real.;42.4444195298375;-76.4925479204328
