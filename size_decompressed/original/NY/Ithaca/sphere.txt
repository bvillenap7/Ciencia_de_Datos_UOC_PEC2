I was going to work and had stopped at a stop sign.  When I crossed the road I was drawn to look to my left.  I stopped my car as I saw in the sky, a brilliant white sphere across the lake.  I sat there watching it, amazed.  All of a sudden a search light came out of it, it was shinning on the clouds in front and to the sides of it.  I just sat there watching it.  The search light went out, and within seconds, the bright sphere went out.  I sat a while longer waiting to see if there were blinking lights which would have made it a plane...there were none.  There was also no noise of any kind to be heard.  When planes fly on that side of the lake, it echo's to our side.  No noise, and the object was gone.  I asked at work if anyone had seen it, butno one had noticed it.;42.4444195298375;-76.4925479204328
spherical bright light, radiating red, green and white colors, stationary in eastern horizon, then slowly moving south;2006-11-06 19:00:00;2 hours on/off;spherical bright light, radiating red, green and white colors, stationary in eastern horizon, then slowly moving south Around 7pm Monday 11/06 my mom noticed a bright light in the eastern horizon at about 45 degrees. It seemed to remain in the same location for about 10 minutes. I came home and she told me to take a look at this. I got binoculars and saw a sphere shaped object radiating flashing lights of white, red, and green. At times the sphere seemed to move in sometimes a circle or back and forth. There was some cloud cover and sometimes it could be seen through the clouds, sometimes not. I watched it on and off for about an hour and by then it had moved a little higher and more south. Soon, some air craft (jets?) I could see the contrails headed towards the light. There wear eventually 3-4 jet craft going towards it. The light then disappeared behind some cloud cover. I checked about a half hour later and did not see it.;42.4444195298375;-76.4925479204328
