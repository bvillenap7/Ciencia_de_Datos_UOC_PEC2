Reddish/orange and white flashing object in sky at Ithaca NY;2012-07-29 23:30:00;2-3 minutes;Reddish/orange and white flashing object in sky at Ithaca NY Was traveling southerly down HGY 13 toward Ithaca about a mile out of town.  A craft at high altitude was approaching from the southwest, then it began to slow and finally stopped. It then almost reversed direction and went straight south and disappeared near the moon.  It looked to be little smaller than the size of a pea at arms length and was brighter than the moon.  It appeared to have the color of something on fire: reddish orange and white.  It sporadically flashed the reddish - orange light and occasionally a white flash or two.  It never repeated the pattern.;42.4444195298375;-76.4925479204328
Ithaca, NY fiery massive structure above route 13 by Cornell;2012-09-21 20:47:00;5 seconds;Ithaca, NY fiery massive structure above route 13 by Cornell 09/21/2012 8:47-8:48 PM Ithaca, New York, 14850. I was on the second floor patio of my friends apartment that has a clear view of the night sky over the tip of Lake Cayuga, route 13, and the Cornell campus. I looked up and for about 4 or 5 seconds and saw what I can only describe as a shifting, very large object that looked like it was on fire with no specific pattern. Its colors mixed between orange, red, and white. It levitated high in the sky between Lake Cayuga and Cornell University and over route 13. It appeared out of nowhere and was still for a moment, it zipped down south, hovered, and sped off faster than anything I'd ever seen. All in this short amount of time. It was so massive in size I could only stand and stare in wonder in a state of shock and awe.;42.4444195298375;-76.4925479204328
