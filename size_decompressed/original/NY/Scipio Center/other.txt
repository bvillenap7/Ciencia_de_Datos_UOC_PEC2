A flying pea pod with four lighted peas on top.;2003-10-29 22:50:00;3minutes;A flying pea pod with four lighted peas on top. The object first appeared as a moving star so I got my binoculars and saw that the object looked like half a pea pod shell with four peas in it. The first three circles (peas) were bright yellow with a hint of orange. The fourth circle(pea) was blue. The pod was black and there were no blinking lights. It was travelling faster and lower than the aircraft I normally see at night.;42.7708;-76.5862
