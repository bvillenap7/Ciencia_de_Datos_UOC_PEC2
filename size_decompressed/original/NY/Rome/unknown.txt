I looked up at the sky, clear.  Saw two diagional, dull red glows, fairly close together, moveing at a high rate of speed, not high in sky, moveing in a NW direction, no sound, no other lights.  I could not make out any shape of the object. If this was a conventional craft it should have had lights on and I should have heard some sound from the engines since it was not high and it was going fast.
