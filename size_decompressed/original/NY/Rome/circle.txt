Two fire ball like balls floating high in the sky!!;2012-08-18 20:25:00;7 minutes;Two fire ball like balls floating high in the sky!! Last night at 8:25 pm I was walking the dogs before bed. Looked up into the sky and saw what seemed to be two balls of fire floating.  One right behind the other going kind of slow at first and then sped up then again back to slow.  I ran inside and got my girlfriend who saw it to then she ran inside and got her three kids who also saw the event.   Seconds later the ball that was in front just kind of phaded away and then maybe two seconds later the last ball did the same. It was the craziest thing I have ever saw in the sky.  I thought maybe it could have been hot air balloons or something but after doing re-search, I see a lot of people have seen this take place also!;43.2170850806453;-75.4521540322578
