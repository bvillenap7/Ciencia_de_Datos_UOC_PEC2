My girlfriend and I were driving back into town from Cook Road, where we were fishing. We noticed red glowing lights in Z formation in the sky sitting in place, not moving not falling, just stationary and made no sound. They seemed to be a burning kind of light, I use the word burning because they also one by one faded out.  The size of the formation was significant.  Very noticable to anyone who might look up. They were round balls of burning red light the way a star might look but bigger. I'm 5' 11, 240 lbs, 29 years old white long brown hair with a moustache and goatee. My day to day is working under the table taking care of my daughter, fishing, and playing poker. My girl freind is 25 55 130 lbs medium length brown hair also white.  She takes care of her son, works at the hospital, and plays poker and fishes with us, as well.;43.2170850806453;-75.4521540322578
