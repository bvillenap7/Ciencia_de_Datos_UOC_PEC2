Bright lights - erratic movement over Rome NY;2002-10-07 18:45:00;10+ Min's;Bright lights - erratic movement over Rome NY As I was driving to pick up my sister at her high school, I noticed a VERY bright (what i thought was a star) object in the sky. Noting it out of the corner of my eye, another appeared about the 7:00 position below it. I picked up my sis and we sat in the car with a clear view of the west, and noticed the bottom one started zig-zagging left and right. At least two other ones appeard below the large bright one and did the same. The bright one dimmed dropped down even with the other two and shot back up. The lights changed from brigh to dark several times and then one dark one shot across below those, much closer. We observed this activity until clouds rolled in and obscured the view.. Wondering if anyone else in the area saw this?! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));43.2170850806453;-75.4521540322578
