There's a small air port about 3 miles from my house.As I looked up to see the plane,there was something strange in the sky heading east to west, it was above the plane. The plane was going east,there was some clouds in the sky witch wre heading east also, thats when I noticed this object moving west. It was a good size, I did'nt notice any lights or sound comming from it.
