Moving object appeared to be on fire.;2014-07-12 21:30:00;3 minutes;Moving object appeared to be on fire. Object moved from the North to the South above Oak Hill.  It appeared to be on fire.  The bright orange light appeared to grow in stature getting very bright red orange.  I've never seen anything in the night sky this bright.  As if an aircraft was on fire with flames.   It moved along well above the hill in a Southerly direction, not altogether fast either. Then began to slow down, and came to a dead stop.......hovering for about 15 seconds.  Still.  The magnitude of brightness dimmed.  Then the light just went out. I watched the night sky all my life, and can safely say, I have no logical explanation for what my wife, and I saw.
