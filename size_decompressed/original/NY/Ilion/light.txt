7 lights or more in a straight line as long as 7 miles.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-03 22:10:00;5 minutes;7 lights or more in a straight line as long as 7 miles I was walking my dog and I always look up at the stars.  I saw what I thought was a star moving fro West to East in the Northern Sky.  I thought maybe I was seeing a satellite.  When the first light was nearly out of sight to the East, I noticed another light coming from the West on the same exact trajectory, maybe a mile behind the first.  This happened a total of 7 lights, each about the same distance apart, and looked like at the same height.  No blinking of lights, a solid light, no pulsating, no change of color, no noise.  Initially I thought an airplane, but no noise, maybe a star, but no twinkle, and moving west to East, another comes, another, another, seven times. There may have been more as I may not have seen the first light. Donâ€™t know what I saw? I tried taking video with my phone but it looks like a blank sky.;43.0054;-75.0528
