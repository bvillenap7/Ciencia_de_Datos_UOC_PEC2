Bright light shooting in what appeared to be an upwards trajectory;2011-05-13 21:00:00;5 seconds;Bright light shooting in what appeared to be an upwards trajectory An extremely bright light shot upward for a short period of time and vanished.  Perhaps it was something mundane, but I wanted to report it in case others saw it as well and perhaps we can figure out what it was. It did not in any way look like a shooting star, and I don't think it was a firework.  It was truly bright.  It did seem to be shooting upward, but it is difficult to judge directions with no landmarks for bearings. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
