Unknown object viewed through 8 telescope containing 3 bright lights arranged in triangular shape;2003-09-12 20:40:00;2 minutes;Unknown object viewed through 8 telescope containing 3 bright lights arranged in triangular shape At a local star gazing session we noticed a possible satellite (no blinking lights) travelling east to west across the southern sky (approximately 20-30 degrees above the horizon).  I managed to catch the object in an 8 dobsonian reflector telescope and track it off and on for over a minute.  It had three bright lights arranged in a triangular shape and passed in front of the starfield behind it.  We all thought it could have been the ISS or a satellite, however, upon returning home, I checked NASA's J-Track software for satellite observations at 20:40 and the only objects remotely visible were 2 small orbcomm satellites (FM7 and FM8). I had a good view with the telescope and have never seen an object like this traveling east to west. ((NUFORC Note:  Virtually no satellites have a groundtrack with a significant westerly component to them.  PD));42.9385;-74.6539
