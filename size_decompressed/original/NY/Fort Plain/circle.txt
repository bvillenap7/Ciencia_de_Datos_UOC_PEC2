Red flaming object shot across the sky;2021-08-03 20:45:00;4 seconds;Red flaming object shot across the sky During our walk at dusk an object shot across the sky as we walked and faced southwest. This object was traveling at a great velocity (would guesstimate at least a few thousand mph) and had small red flames shooting from the round shape, and these flames were only a couple times the length of the round form, and not long and trailing. This object traveled from southeast to northwest where the Sun had set a couple hours earlier here in Upstate NY. It only took about 4 seconds then it seemed to just disappear while in our view. There was no sound and no visible streak that it made, it also was flying parallel to the ground, not flying toward the ground. It just disappeared halfway across the sky. We werenâ€™t sure what we were seeing.;42.9385;-74.6539
