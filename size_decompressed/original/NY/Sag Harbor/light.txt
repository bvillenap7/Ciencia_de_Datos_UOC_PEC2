Strange light in the sky;2010-07-11 21:15:00;2 minutes;Strange light in the sky I was standing on my deck shortly after dusk and looking to the east and saw a bright round light travelling towards the southeast towards the ocean on eastern Long Island.  I have seen thousands of planes, satellites and shooting stars over the decades but this was different. It was a bright white light, with no running lights such as red/green etc.  It was brighter than a plane lights, but what was unusual was it was a light that was whiter than white bordering a chrome color.  It was only going a hundred MPH or so, and only a few thousand feet up. My opinion was the object was a glowing light, not an intense light attached to the object.  The object was not coming towards me so I can rule out landing lights, which are never this white anyway.   Watched for two minutes until object dissappeared behind some trees.  No sound, fading or unusual movements observed. Editor Note: The object was observed on Sunday, July 11, 2010, Not July 10th.  I am resending this report to you with corrected date.;40.982;-72.3067000000001
10 round lights noted by attorney and nurse in Sag Harbor, July 17.;2015-07-17 22:10:00;5 minutes;10 round lights noted by attorney and nurse in Sag Harbor, July 17. On July 17, 2015, my brother and I were standing outside Barronâ€™s Cove Inn, talking, at about ten past ten at night.  I noticed a round flickering circle moving across the sky, from Left to right.  There was first just one and then a second followed in the exact same path.  There was a third and then two more which were side by side followed the others.  A total of ten were noted-all flying along that path slowly.  After about 5 minutes the first in the row disappeared.  Each one in turn did the same.  The two that were side by side disappeared together.  No details other than the bright circular lights were noted by us as the objects were out over the water.
