Large boomerang craft escorted by two smaller craft;2011-02-18 19:10:00;30 minutes;Large boomerang craft escorted by two smaller craft Getting out of my truck in my driveway, observed a large object with three white lights on it and a center red light.   Two other smaller objects seem to be be escorting it.  Objects moved very slowly and did two big loops over my town in the next half hour. The large object was bigger than any commercial jet I have seen at night and appeared to have a large wingspan, maybe boomerang or diamond.    The two other craft escorting it were smaller and appeared to have red and green lights.   I did not hear any helicopter engines and the only sound I could hear was possibly a jet engine, but very quiet one if that.  They were several thousand feet up.  What was odd was the way they acted in the sky.   First time I have seen flying objects that seemed to be cruising around with no destination.  My 7 year old son observed the crafts when I called him out the porch. I also noticed bright flashes of light in the sky  to the north at the time like a lightning storm, but the weathe! r was clear.;40.982;-72.3067000000001
