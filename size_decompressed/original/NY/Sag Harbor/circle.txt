Orange light over Sag Harbor.;2013-08-17 21:00:00;30 minutes;Orange light over Sag Harbor. Orange ball of light.  Same color as a flame, moved across the sky slowly then just disappeared.  Not sure if the same one reappeared or if it was multiple lights, but there was never more than one at the same time.   We saw it three times over the course of half an hour.  The light stayed the same color and brightness until it disappeared. No blinking lights.;40.982;-72.3067000000001
