Bright red ball shaped object in southern sky.;2012-08-26 23:30:00;5 seconds;Bright red ball shaped object in southern sky Went outside house for smoke and looked south over ocean and noticed a red ball of light swoop down from sky make a right turn and head in a westerly direction.  The object was a bright cherry red ball of light that then faded out to darkness.  Speed fast, but not too fast. No other lights or trails on object.  Probably at least 5 miles from me.  Unknown size. Object was not burning, just a solid lit red ball shaped craft.;40.982;-72.3067000000001
Fireballs (4) flew over;2013-07-27 21:50:00;4 minutes;Fireballs (4) flew over I went out on my deck for a smoke tonight and finally had the chance to see the fireballs everyone has been reporting for the past 3 years.I live on eastern Long Island, and same a bright red fireballs approach from the southern horizon. Estimated speed was 80 to 160 MPH.   Craft were silent.  Went from south to north. Reminded me of a helicopter speed and altitude. Not a chinese lantern! Deep red with flickering inside, and died out as it passed over my house.  No wind and scattered clouds. 3 more passed over at 1 exactly minute intervals, and exact same flight path.  Total of 4, and I tried to take camcorder pictures, but would not focus due to being night. My opinion is it has some type of silent propulsion system, but I cannot give honest opinion as to what it is.  Not an aircraft, (larger and faster and silent than a aircraft).  Definitely under intelligent control, either from aboard craft or remote.  Very unusual,I am 60 yoa and have never seen this before.   Let me repeat, after watching 4 go over at rather high speed, they are NOT chinese lanterns, planes, satellites, etc. Cannot explain what I saw.;40.982;-72.3067000000001
Fireballs visit Long Island again.;2013-11-30 21:10:00;3 minutes;Fireballs visit Long Island again I was out on my deck and observed the so called fireballs again.  I saw the same thing last summer and made a report here then, (See Sag Harbor,NY).  The orange ball was travelling south to north again, this time several miles distant from me as I was looking west. Unknown altitude and speed.  I called my son and told him to watch and that it would flicker out and another would appear then, exactly in the spot where we saw the first one. True to form, this is exactly what happened.  I told him to watch and as soon as this one died out another would appear.  This is exactly what happened as it did last summer. I don't like the term fireball as these are orange balls and have no tail. Nother appears on fire, but they sorta flicker out.  Again I have no explanation for them.;40.982;-72.3067000000001
