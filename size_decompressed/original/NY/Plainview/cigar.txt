300 ft Cigar Shaped UFO traveling at Mach speed at approx. 15,000ft above Grumman in Bethpage, NY;2008-12-14 10:30:00;30 to 40 seconds;300ft Cigar Shaped UFO traveling at Mach speed at approx. 15,000ft above Grumman in Bethpage, NY The UFO was a cigar shaped high reflective chrome like object. I was wallking my dog when I first noticed it and was suprised to see the object travelig at Mach speed of at least 700 MPH at about 15,000ft. There was no sound, no con-trail, and the UFO appeared to be about 300 ft. in lenght. This object was moving quickly across the sky and was gone from sight in less than 60 seconds. I have never seen any aircraft like it. there were no wings. I repeat no wings. I'm not aware of any technology known to mankind of this type to date. I'm not sure if you have received similar reports, however I know what I saw and I'm 100% confident it wasn't of human origin. This object made no sound even though I calculated it moved at Mach speed ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
