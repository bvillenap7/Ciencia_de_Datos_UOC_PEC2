I was standing in my backyard waiting for my dog to do its business. I looked up for a second and saw a strange formation of white, red, and green lights that moved in an odd motion without blinking in the night sky. I first believed it to be a helicopter, but it did not sound like one. The craft moved very slowly, and then started hovering at the same altitude. The craft also made a low, humming noise similar to a blimp.  The problem was that the craft was much smaller than a blimp.  There was only one of these strange crafts.  Scared, I called out my two sons who inferred the craft to be a circular shape because of the light pattern.  The three of us examined the craft for approximately 25 seconds when the craft disappeared in the blink of an eye.
