Saw triangular shaped object w/3 lights.;1999-12-16 21:30:00;~5 mins;Saw triangular shaped object w/3 lights. Driving south, I saw a triangular shaped object approx 3000-5000 feet in the sky, moving in a WSW direction.  It had 3 non-blinking white lights, at 3 corners of the object.  I tried to follow but when I was able to look again from a safe driving perspective, I could no longer locate the object.  I didn't hear any unusual sounds.;40.7746;-73.4761
4 lights in the shape of a triangle were seen in the night sky.;2013-10-24 20:00:00;1 hour;4 lights in the shape of a triangle were seen in the night sky.  I used a star gazing app to see if it was a planet or star but nothing showed at its location.  The star gazing app recorded a warning of extremely magnetic field.  I'm posting two pictures side by side so you can see the lights on your own compared tothe highlighted location in red that I drew.  I'm  also including the app screenshot noting the warning notice. This is the second night in a  row  with the same lights and the same app warning but from two coherent places in Plainview.;40.7746;-73.4761
