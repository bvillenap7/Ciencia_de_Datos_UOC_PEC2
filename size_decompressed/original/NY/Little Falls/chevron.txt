Three triangular craft flying silently over Mohawk Valley in Upstate NY;1978-07-21 23:00:00;10 seconds;Three triangular craft flying silently over Mohawk Valley in Upstate NY I have always had a fascination for looking at the stars and imagining myself flying to them one day.   One evening, sometime around July 1978 (as best I can remember), I was outside on the porch taking a quick look at the stars before heading inside.  It was quite dark, so it must have been 11:00 pm or later.  I noticed 3 groups of dim red lights, in formation, moving slowly from west to east, following the direction of the Mohawk River.  Each group consisted of 5 dim, red lights, each, with a leading light and two on each side such that they formed a triangular pattern.  If one imagines the letter “V”, there would be a light at the point of the “V” with two lights on each leg of the “V”.  The point of the “V” was pointing in the flight direction and the pattern of lights gave the impression that there were swept back wings.  There was an object in the lead and two following, one just a short distance behind each “wing tip” (for lack of a better description)! .  The objects were totally silent.   After watching for a few seconds, I ran into the house because they scared me for some reason.  I never saw them again after that.  I estimated their altitude to be very low, maybe a few thousand feet, based on the terrain and my history of observing aircraft.   In later years, I saw a photo, or video, of a B2 stealth bomber that had lights on its leading edge that looked similar to what I had seen (I looked just now, and cannot find that image on line).  But B2’s were not officially produced until over a decade later, and they are not silent.   However, our house was only about 20-25 miles from Griffiss Air Force Base, so who knows.
