Moving light viewed from a house in Rocky Point.;1975-06-30 00:00:00;15 min;moving light viewed from a house in Rocky Point im not sure how old i was but i was little. i was at my grandparents house and it was late but i wasn't tired. so i went and sat near the window and looked up at the sky to see if i could count the stars. with that cane a light looking as if it was falling to earth but then catching an up drift of wind and moving all around so i called for my grandparents and they came in and told me they have never seen anything like it before, we knew it was NOT a plane because it only had one light and it didn't blink it was also silent. i haven't seen anything to do with UFOs since the incident.

Green/Teal Lights up night sky, fast moving light;2019-07-24 23:00:00;2-3 seconds;Green/Teal Lights up night sky, fast moving light Around 11pm tonight my boyfriend and I were standing outside smoking a cigarette in the street.  I was facing southeast when the sky illuminated a greenish/teal color everywhere for a couple of seconds. It lightly strobed through the trees I quickly spotted a bright green/teal super fast moving light shooting Northern possibly slightly westward in the sky that disappeared just as quickly.  It looked distant because of how fast and how quickly it stopped and disappeared. My boyfriend says he did not spot the light because he was facing me, and it disappeared too quick, but confirms the whole sky turned bright greenish.  We were both awestruck.  Perhaps it was a meteor?;40.9456;-72.9345
