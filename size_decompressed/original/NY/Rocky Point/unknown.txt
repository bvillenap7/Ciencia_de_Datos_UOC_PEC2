I don't remember the exact date however I do remember all the details as if it happened yesterday.  I was awakened in the middle of the night by a very distinguished sound the sounded like this EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE............  I remember trying to sit up in my bed and was not able to because I was being somehow held down as if someone was hold the sheets down restricting me to the bed. I remember trying with all of my strength to try and sit up.  The only movement  I had was in my neck and face.  My arms, body, legs and toes were completly immobilized.  I remember crying histerically because I didn't what was going on.  I figure this was going on between 2:00 and 4:00 in the morning.  I eventually cried myself back to sleep. When I awoke the next morning to go to school I was able to sit up however my stomach muscles were so sore it was very painfull.  Also, to my surprise when I left the house I noticed that my neighbors car had also mysteriously rolled down the driveway and ended up lodged in my other neihbors tree. To this day I have no idea what was happening that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in September 1989 is approximate.  PD));40.9456;-72.9345
