Bright object seen moving north of Riverhead, Long Island, NY.;2010-08-29 21:00:00;1hr+;Bright object seen moving north of Riverhead, Long Island, NY. I have been witnessing a very bright unknown lighted object in the sky to the west of my residence. Even with the use of a decent set of binoculars, I have been unable to determine exactly what it is.  I have been seeing the exact same object almost every night for the last two weeks. It moves very slowly to the north until it can no longer be seen.  I would estimate that the object is flying somewhere over riverhead or calverton, then north to the long island sound out of my view.  I'm definitely not implying that this is an alien spacecraft, but I would like to know exactly what it is. If you live on eastern long island and have been seeing this same object, please report it on this site.;41.0092;-72.4767
