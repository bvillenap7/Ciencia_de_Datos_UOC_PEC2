No movement whatsoever detected after observing the object for approximately 5 minutes.;2001-02-19 19:30:00;5 minutes;No movement whatsoever detected after observing the object for approximately 5 minutes. My fiancee and I were driving home from work on the North Road Eastern Long Island when an object appeared with blinking multi colored lights (red, white, blue) in the northern half of the sky. We thought it was a small plane at first but the object appeared frozen in the sky as we were driving.  We slowed the car and continued to look at the object but no movement was detected. No other aircraft were in the vicinity at the time. Anyone else see the object?;41.0092;-72.4767
