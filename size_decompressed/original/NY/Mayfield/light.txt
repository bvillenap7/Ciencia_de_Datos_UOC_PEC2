Strange lights over Mayfield;2005-03-15 01:00:00;1 minute;Strange lights over Mayfield My apartment is on the second floor.  My bedroom window faces west across highway 30 to a high wooded hill.  On the hill is no railroad, road, powerlines.  I've never seen anything unusual there before.  On 3/15/05 I was watching TV in the bedroom.  At approximatly 1:00am I heard rumbling noise that seemed to be coming from the driveway.  I went to the bedroom window and saw a line of multicolored lights in the sky above the hillside.  There were seven lights that were red, yellow and green.  I grabbed my digital camera from the nightstand and shot four pictures.  The first didn't come out as the flash was turned on.  The other three taken without the flash showed the lights.  After the last picture, I glanced down to the camera's preview screen the be sure the pictures were good, and when I looked up, the lights were gone, so I can't say if they moved or just went out.  During the brief time I saw them, the lights did not change color, move, or change spacing between them.;43.1388;-74.2489

I work up my girlfriend who came out and also witnessed this.  The object moved in a semi circle away from us and was stationary for over an hour.  We both have video of it.  It reappeared 2 nights later at the same time.  We also have vido of that.;43.1388;-74.2489
