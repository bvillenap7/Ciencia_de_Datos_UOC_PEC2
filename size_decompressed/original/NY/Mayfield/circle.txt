The object NNW was stationary with several rotating flashing lights. The second was large and black (much closer) with flashing rotating lights and 2 spot lite like lights in the center. The second object moved very rapidly from the NE to SW shimmering or shaking as it went, then was gone. Object #1 stayed stationary for several more minutes and they were both gone~;43.1388;-74.2489
My wife, mother in law, and two friends were on my pontoon boat on the Great Sacandaga Lake in Mayfield, New York.  It was 20:00 on 7/1;2020-07-15 20:03:00;30 minutes;My wife, mother in law, and two friends were on my pontoon boat on the Great Sacandaga Lake in Mayfield, New York.  It was 20:00 on 7/15/20 and we were anchored just off Beacon island on the south end of the lake.  My mother in law said, “What is that in the sky?”  Just seconds after discussion of the comet that was supposed to be visible that night.  We all looked up and saw a white cylindrical object high in the sky.  I am a private pilot and I would estimate the object to be around 20,000ft to 30,000ft or possibly even higher in the sky.  It appeared to be above the cirrus clouds. The sky was blue except for a few clouds.  The object did not move at all and stayed in the same exact spot for about thirty minutes.  It was eventually obstructed by cirrus clouds as they moved under the object.  We attempted to take photos of the object but none of the photos came out clear enough.  I wondered if it was a star or planet, however the sun was not set yet and there! were no other objects or stars anywhere else in the sky.  This object looked very much out of place.  I questioned if it was a weather balloon but like I stated above, the object never moved from this spot.  It never appeared larger or smaller as if it was ascending or descending.  It stayed completely still and the size did not appear to change.  It was white in color, assuming it was reflecting sunlight and we were unable to properly identify the color.  Several hours later, my friend sent me a screenshot of the object that someone took in Johnstown, NY. About 15 minutes south of our position.  This picture was much more clear than our blurry photos and the object looked more like and unidentified flying object.  Not just a weather balloon.  This object did not make any noise.  All photos will be sent via email. The photos took from my boat were taken at 20:03.  I do not have a time the photos were taken from Johnstown, however is was roughly the same timeframe.;43.1388;-74.2489
