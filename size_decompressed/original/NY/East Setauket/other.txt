Football shaped, pink luminous with vapor trail.;1996-07-31 21:00:00;2 seconds;Football shaped, pink luminous with vapor trail. When this UFO sighting happened to me, it was 2 weeks after the TWA 800 flight went down. I was in my sisters back yard, located in E. Setauket, NY. It was about 9 PM and my sister was putting  the kids, to bed, so I went out side for a little star gazing. The sighting happened within seconds!  The shape was like a football with some sort of seam in the middle. The color was pink and luminous . To my eyes it punched into the atmosphere  and punched back out again, very quickly.   It appeared  to leave a vapor trail behind it. For many weeks after my sighting, I went online, wrote Letters, filled out forms etc., and spoke to people. The sad part was, no one really believed me, even though They said  they did. The truth is you have to see it to believe it. I felt that this sighting had something to do with TWA Flight 800, But will never know for sure. I wrote this letter because, while watching CNN Larry King, UFOâ€™s was the subject  and  someone on the panel said to write in about it, so I have.
