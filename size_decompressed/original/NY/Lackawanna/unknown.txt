spotlight at night, 90' away, no sound or wind.;1988-06-01 23:00:00;4 min.;spotlight at night, 90' away, no sound or wind. I was about 14, snuck out of the house, calm quiet summer night, walking down Electric ave.  I stopped when up ahead of me there was a very bright spot light shining down on the road, it's source was about 60' up, as the light moved across the street I tried to see what it was coming from and just saw dark, thinking it must be a helicopter, then realized there was no sound or any wind. I was on one side of a small bridge and it was at the other maby 50' away, it traveled slowly across the street and along the edge of smokes creek, then was gone.

Not sure what was making this noise and have never heard it before.  This lasted about 20 minutes.  Was  too terrified to look outside.;42.8136000000006;-78.8098000000008
