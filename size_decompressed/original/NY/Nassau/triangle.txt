Although I am a firm believer in the UFO phenomenon I tend to NOT discuss it with the average Joe. Ok here goes. It was 10/31/99 approximately 6:45 PM I was taking (my then 5 year old daughter) to her aunts to meet up with my wife (her mom) so she and her cousins could all go trick or treating together. We hopped in our Plymouth POS. and headed for my sister in laws house, at about 7:00 PM we where just about 5 miles from her house when we crested this small hill running between two very large corn fields, as we peeked the top and headed down the other side our car stalled, now I must inform you that our car had a tendency to overheat OFTEN so this was nothing new to me so I threw the car into neutral and let it coast down the hill until we came to a gentle stop at the bottom. Once we stopped I got out of the car and opened the hood as to release some of the heat, it was a cool night so I decided to light up smoke and wait my daughter was asleep in her car seat in the back and I never smoked near my children so it was kind of a perfect situation for a smoke. As usual as soon as I lit up it started to rain (not a heavy rain but a light sprinkle) but enough to send me into a retreat into my car so I threw away my cigarette and as I grabbed the door handle the rain stopped and I remember feeling aggravated and thinking dam I just threw my smoke away and that’s when I realized it was still raining, I could hear it raining all around me then I came to realize also that it WASN'T raining on me or my car that’s when I looked up. To my utter shock and surprise there above my head was this absolutely huge... how else can I say it UFO it was triangular shaped but not a normal triangle shape the sides of the triangle were curved and I could also see some detail, for instance the bottom (that was really the only side I could see) I saw curved indentations and grooves cut into the surface but the weirdest thing was that nothing appeared to be uniform it all appeared to be random if that’s the word I can use, and there was NO SOUND none at all man it was really strange that it was totally silent just sitting there in the sky motionless and that coupled with the fact that it was raining all around me but not on me I’m getting goose bumps remembering all this as I’m typing this. As if all this wasn’t enough, while I was standing there taking all this in a light turned on and shown down on top of my car that’s when my daughter woke up she called out to me and I got in the car, once in the car I instinctively locked all the doors then I noticed that this light that was shining down into my car was shinning everywhere, now when I say this I MEAN IT WAS SHINING EVERYWHERE it was like looking at a negative...everything my daughter, the seats, the dash, everything was like looking at a photographic negative it was so very strange and just as quickly as it came the light was gone I quickly rolled down the window of the car and looked up and this huge object floated away to my left ( I’m not quite sure of the exact direction ) north I think, and there was absolutely no sound, once it was over the cornfield the light shown down again this time illuminating a rabbit that was out in the field, the rabbit started to run the beam followed it for a short time then it turned off again. I slowly got back out of the car I was standing there for just a second and then it left so fast I almost couldn't determine what direction it went, I mean it was just gone and not a sound not even a peep to this day I have dreams about this incident and I have even talked to my daughter about it she says she remembers something but I think she just humoring me she was just to young to remember but I appreciate what she’s trying to do. Well that’s my story I have other sightings but none as dramatic as this one thanks for reading this.;42.5272000000001;-73.6157999999998
