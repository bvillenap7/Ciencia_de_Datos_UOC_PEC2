four white lights in a straight line with one another. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible landing lights on airliners??  PD));2005-03-29 23:00:00;25 min;four white lights in a straight line with one another. On march 29, 2005, I wittnesed four lights that were in a line with one another. The objects appeared to be at a equal distance to one another. I was looking off to the west toward nyc and JFK airport.  It was 11:00 pm.  The objects hovered most of the time and than one of the objects moved slowly toward another and went on top of the other. When this happen the object on top began to glow a very bright white light. The other three objects were mostly still but at times moved across the horizon slowly.  At times they would become bright and than dim. The lights moved parellel to the horizon line.  This was the second time I saw these lights. The first time was superboewl night at 9:00pm. They exhibited the same behavior.  I have lived in Long Island, atlantic beach for 25 years in the same location. Besides these two sightings I have never seen this  before. Four other people wittnesed the same thing.  Finally, I contacted JFK and the local fort hamilton airforce base and both have said they were unaware of the lights.This excludes an airplane of helicopters. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible landing lights on airliners??  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite credible.  PD));42.5272000000001;-73.6157999999998
Bright Light on Meadowbrook State Parkway;2009-01-28 20:00:00;10-20 minutes;Bright Light on Meadowbrook State Parkway I was driving Northbound on the Meadowbrook State Parkways, right around Jones Beach.  I was alone in the car going for a joyride.  I remember thinking to myself, I know I am going to see something extraordinary tonight.  Where I was driving, there is a lot of air traffic.  I'm very familiar with a lot of the aircrafts, frankly because I see them every night.  I remember looking toward the north sky, and seeing about 3 airplanes.  I looked back to the road, and noticed I was the only car driving Northbound (for at least a couple of miles). I looked back to where the planes were, and saw a huge white light in the middle of the sky. It looked unfamiliar to me. There were no flashing lights, or anything else that may have caused it to be recognized as an airplane. It was moving very slow. I was going about 40 mph (because I was the only one on the parkway). It slowly glided down the sky, and ended up on my left side, over the water. It stayed in that position, seeming to be following me, for about 7 minutes. Then it looked as if it was getting farther away... I drover under the overpass. Coming out the other side, I looked back to the sky, and the light was brighter than ever. It was if it had gotten closer in those few seconds. I was in total disbelief. I became scared because in my heart I knew something was watching me. I began to move slower. I took my eyes off of it for the last time. I looked back and it was gone.;42.5272000000001;-73.6157999999998
