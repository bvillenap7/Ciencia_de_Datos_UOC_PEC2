strange streaking blue light;2007-01-12 17:00:00;1/4 second;strange streaking blue light friday afternoon i was driving from vermont to new york city down route 22.  around 4:50ish, as i was passing through the town of Millerton, NY, i observed a streaking (more like a pulse) blue light that resembled the speed and motion of a meteorite but was much brighter, distinctly blue, and much closer (under the cloud cover).  it lasted for no more than a quarter-second.  i imagine it would have been visible to a great number of other motorists/casual witnesses for a radius of at least 50 miles.  i thought about calling it in to 911 but it didn't seem appropriate.  i am utterly and completely flummoxed by this visual event.  i know this is a huge longshot but if anyone else witnessed same, chime in.  would have been this past friday a little before 5PM.;41.9575;-73.5283
