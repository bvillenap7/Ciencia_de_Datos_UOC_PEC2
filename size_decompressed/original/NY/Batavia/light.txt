Flashing Vertical Beam of White Light from an unknown source;2005-02-18 18:55:00;couple minutes;Flashing Vertical Beam of White Light from an unknown source I was driving westbound on the New York State Thruway, between the LeRoy and Batavia Exits, when I noticed a white beam of light, vertical, flashing on for a few seconds, then off for several.   The sky was mostly cloudy, I was unable to determine whether the source of this light beam was from the ground or air.  This beam was approximately four miles from Batavia and approximately two miles north of the Thruway in what I would describe as a rural, farming area.   Finally, other vehicles on the Thruway appeared to slow down while this light was visible.  I reported this to the Meteorology Department at WIVB, Channel 4, Buffalo, New York.  I have not received a response.;42.9967;-78.1968999999999

Airliner foo fighter?  Bright point of light plays with airliner.;2014-10-12 18:30:00;10-15 minutes;Airliner &quotfoo fighter&quot?  Bright point of light plays with airliner. 6:30 pm. I-90 west bound from Batavia, NY  10-15 min event  3 airliners leaving short contrails. Odd thing, if there were four, they would have been evenly spaced in a trailing line formation.  Two ahead, a space and the third. 1 ufo around trailing aircraft. Wink in and out.  Very bright. Very fast.  Ahead behind and around.  Seemed to be playing around the last airliner. I cannot judge their altitude.  I could roughly judge speed.  If the airliners were moving at about 400 knots, then this Bright Light object must have been doing 1000-2000 knots to be able to dart ahead and behind and all around.  I did not see it the whole time of the event as it kept winking in and out of view.  It was extraordinarily bright.  In the few minutes that I saw this happen, the first time it winked out and winked back into view as a bright point of light I knew it wasn't a fighter jet.  Even a fighter with afterburners could not move that fast.  Also about midway through the event this light danced around the airliner, again, even a fighter is not that nimble.  The speed and agility and brightness and very close proximity to the airliner combined are what really caught my attention. Being the only observer, I'm approx. 40 years old.

Chopper chasing a round bright light over Batavia, New York!!!!!;2017-11-29 06:45:00;120 seconds;chopper chasing a round bright light over Batavia New York!!!!! it started as me my wife, and my 11 year old grandson was taking a walk.  we heard a chopper, and it came into view..  Suddenly, we noticed a large round bright white light moving steady without making any sound at all, other than the helicopter that was staying in a steady speed behind the craft,  at a distance of about 100 yards.  It was like the helicopter (was not) chasing the bright white light, but rather flying in formation by using distance behind the craft.  We all got a very good look at this thing, and as it passed over us.  I could faintly see a gray round disc craft!!!!  I can say this for sure.  I never really believed fully that there were aliens, as well as UFO's, but I do believe it now, as I saw one!!!! With my own eyes..;42.9967;-78.1968999999999
