Not closing or seperating at all, it's believed to be one aircraft. The lights flew over head very slow, much slower than plan & made absolutly no noise at all.   Moving from west to southeast at low altitude I could not see between them being the same color as the sky. Within 2 min we seen 1 helechopper fly north,3 min later another Helichopper apeared flying oppisite way as the UFO due west. one of these had to have noticed the large flying object est. size 1/4 mile long. One light on each side, low & slow flying stedily and smooth making no noise 1/2 to 3/4 mile in the sky. Very strange like they were observing the area. I do belive this to be a true UFO, Both witnesses were sober and positive of this sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
