Approximately 8 pm 10/24/2020, my daughter and I were walking when we saw a massive line of lights jet accross the night sky from the north to south just above Mount Mcgregor. The sky was very cloudy and a bright moon. Clouds appeared to be moving from northeast to southwest. The line of lights slowed and met with a triangle shaped object with 3 flashing lights, a green hue appeared as the triangle appeared to be rotating slowly. I called for my son to come out. The line of lights disappeared and just 3 lights were visible in the clouds changing white to green in the clouds. We moved to a field without lights to see better. We saw 2 more sets of triangle lights and another some distance away that just move so fast it joined the others. They seemed to just sit there just above the mountain top within the clouds. We watched for another half hour before they disappeared. We drove over the mountain to see if they moved somewhere on the other side, but no luck. We checked through out the rest of the night, no other siting.;43.1842;-73.7039000000001
