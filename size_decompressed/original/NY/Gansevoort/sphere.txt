It was headed south from a northerly direction and its path was diagonal and somewhat angled towards the earth.  I do not believe it was a shooting star, for it was a cloudy night (only two stars were visible in the sky) and the object was about the size of a ping-pong ball or half-dollar.  I feel it was denifitely in our atmosphere and relatively close to the earth. Also, it did not have a trail and did not fade out. It was also almost directly above our heads.;43.1842;-73.7039000000001
