White Spheres Sail Across Early Evening Skies.;2005-09-03 18:23:00;0:00:3500;White Spheres Sail Across Early Evening Skies. I am not sure, I noticed a pure white sphere heading agains the cloud direction at a somewhat slow pace...like the pace of an air plane.  I couldn't tell the altitude, but as that one sphere went across and disappeared another one followed behind it in the same direction, speed, and altitude.  I don't know if they were balloons or what they were and I couldn't tell if the went behind the cloud level or infront, but it was really neat to see and I snapped off three shots on my digital camera, but I don't know if you could even see the spheres or not.;41.3033;-73.7829000000001
