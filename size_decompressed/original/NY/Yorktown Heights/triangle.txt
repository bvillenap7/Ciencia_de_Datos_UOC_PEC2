The triangular formation of lights seemed to be fixed in relation to each other as if the lights were part of one solid object that I would estimate to have been over one football field in diameter.   The lights from this huge, dark object seemed to be floating no more than maybe 1000 feet above the ground.   At no time did I hear any sound coming from this object at all and as it passed over me the seven white lights all turned to a deep red color all at once.   I continued to follow this object with my eyes until it was lost by me still heading south.;41.3033;-73.7829000000001
