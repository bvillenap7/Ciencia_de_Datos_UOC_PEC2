circle object flying at low speed.;2014-12-08 07:20:00;7 seconds;I was driving north on the Taconic Parkway around 7:20 AM, and while I was driving, I saw in the sky a circle object flying at low speed.   I've never seen an object like before.  It last about 7 seconds and it was flying west towards Rockland/Orange County. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I remember the object being round.  There were no lights on the object.  It seemed to be just a little bit bigger than the appearance of the sun in the morning sky.   I saw it for 7 seconds, or so, as I was driving, but then trees and other objects blocked my view of it.   It was just amazing and shocking at the same time...
