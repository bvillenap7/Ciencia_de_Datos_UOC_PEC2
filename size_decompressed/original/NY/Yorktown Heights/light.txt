Multi lights over Yorktown;1970-06-15 18:00:00;30+;Multi lights over Yorktown I don't remember the exact year or month. But I do remember a LOT of lights (maybe in the East) There were maybe a dozen lights in the night sky at any one time. Could have been more. I know at one point there was a beam of light like a laser. It went straight down, and then sort of travelled back up to the light. Also one was surrounded by a pinkish smoke and a search light. At the end, they kind of went into the largest light. (mother ship?)This lasted for a long time. And neighbors came up to my mothers house to look at it. I know it must have been seen by others only because of the length of time and the numbers in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.3033;-73.7829000000001
