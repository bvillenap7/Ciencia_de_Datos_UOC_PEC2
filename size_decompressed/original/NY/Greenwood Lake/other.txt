First 2 lights merged then moved out of sight. I live approx. 60 miles west of NYC. Noticed 3 lights moving from east to west in a triangular formation. They seems to move too fast for aircraft.  Suddenly the second light excelerated moving into the leading light then out of my field of vision.  The third light followed out of my field of vision.;41.2101;-74.3033
