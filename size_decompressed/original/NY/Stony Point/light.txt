I was driving down the Palisades Parkway between exits 13 and 14 when this blinding light filled up my entire car. I looked behind, in front and on the sides of me but nothing was there. Then all the lights in my car ( the ones on the dashboard that light when your doors are open, when you need oil, etc.) The light stayed for about 3 to 5 minutes and then as quickly as it came it was gone. I've never experienced anything like that in my life. That night i had a dream that I was being abducted by aliens and they kept calling me mean names like ((deleted)) and things of that nature. They also experimented on me in this dream. All my friends thought I really got abducted but I think they're nuts. If anyone has anymore information about sightings in the Rockland County area, please contact me.;41.2278;-73.997

I looked out my window and saw a white light following too obscure of a path to be a plane.  This happened twice within about 30 minutes.;41.2278;-73.997
