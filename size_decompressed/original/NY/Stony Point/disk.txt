White disc  object above Indian Point Nuclear Plant;2007-12-11 11:00:00;10 seconds;White disc  object above Indian Point Nuclear Plant While running on Route 9W in Stony Point, NY I saw a white disc-shaped object in a stationary hover approximately 500 feet above the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant directly across the Hudson River in Buchannan, NY. It was there for 10 seconds it seemed to flicker in and out of sight, like  it was disappearing and then reappearing. After 10 seconds it vanished altogether. The disc was 40-50 feet in diameter and about 10-15 feet in height from my point of view. At the time I was listening to music while running. When the object appeared I was getting alot of strange sounding interference on my radio. It was 40-45 degrees with mostly clear skys at that time.
