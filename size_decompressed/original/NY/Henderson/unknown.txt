Large bright orange colored light with 2-3 smaller lights surrounding it. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.  Timing is correct. PD));2012-02-02 20:15:00;15 minutes;A large bright orange colored light with 2 or 3 smaller lights surrounding it. saw a bright orangish light hovering over lake ontario. thought it might have been mars or venus because of the color but it was a lot bigger and brighter than i've ever seen either of them.  the object seemed to stay still in the sky for about 10 or 15 minutes. when i looked at it through a pair of binoculars i could see a red light and a white colored light and possibly a third light that looked like it may have been white.  it looked almost like the lights were in a triangular shape but it was hard to tell because there was a lot of glare from the brightness.   after a while it appeared to move to the right(north) a little bit and then after sitting still for a couple more minutes it slowly started moving in what appeared to be a southwestern direction (toward oswego ny) until i was no longer able to see it over the tree line. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.  Timing is correct for Venus, which currently is in the southwest sky, during the early evening.  PD));43.846;-76.1826
