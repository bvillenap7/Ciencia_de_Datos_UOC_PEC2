((anonymous report));2018-04-17 11:00:00;5 minutes;I was sitting in class and looked out of my class window and noticed a small egg-shaped object made of metal.  It was floating above my school, but since I was taking a test I didnâ€™t point it out to anyway.  But since I had my phone in my pocket I tried to take a photo, but as I opened my camera, the object was gone.;42.9339;-73.8993
