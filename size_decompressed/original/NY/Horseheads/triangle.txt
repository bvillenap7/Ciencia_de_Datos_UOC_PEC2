Three red lights hovering in triangular formation over Elmira Heights;2015-11-16 20:08:00;10 minutes;Three red lights hovering in triangular formation over Elmira Heights I was driving South on Route 14 in Horseheads when I saw three triangular shaped red lights hovering in the South East (over Elmira Heights).  I pulled off the road to watch, the three sets of red lights were hovering in a triangular pattern.  I could see that they were three distinct objects, they were not hovering perfectly still.  The light to the West started to break from the formation and its lights went out.  The other two objects remained hovering in their original locations for another five minutes.  The lights to the East then started to break formation and the lights went out.  After another minute the final and central set of lights went out.  The lights were too large to have been helicopters, their formation was too precise as well, and there was no sound of helicopter blades, they would have had to have been the largest helicopters on Earth.  The objects were too large to have been planes at that height and I have not seen a plane that can hov! er in place the way these were hovering.  The red lights on each object were not flashing and did not look like lights on planes.  I called a friend in the next town over to ask if they could see the lights in the valley, unfortunately they could not.  I continued to explain to them what I was seeing for the entirety of the event.;42.1815999999999;-76.8294999999999
