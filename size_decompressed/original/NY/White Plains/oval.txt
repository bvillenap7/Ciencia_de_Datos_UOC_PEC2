It was approxitimately 700-800 feet high.  No more than a hundred feet above treetop level. As I continued north at 65 mph  a oval vehicle came out of the left side of the cloud.  It had no wings or visible engines. It was silent.  We were now at Katonah and the craft lowered about 50 - 100 feet. It stabilized and continued moving north with me in a fixed position. It was ovular.  It had a cross figure in the front. This was brownish in three quarters.  The upper left corner had a white center and a solitary figure in the middle.  It followed me in a fixed position up to the point of Golden's bridge. It was roughly 1800-1830.  The craft then backed up without turning and floated up to the left side of the cloud.  It seemed to jostle as it was resetting back into it's position. The cloud then looked more like a square hour glass.  It banked toward a north easterly direction.  This was below the exit for Brewster,NY. While looking at a UFO Program on the four species visiting Earth.  I recognized the craft with a cross on it. A report was put in MUFON and a Florida based federal agency. There was also radion interference as it left. The same cloud formation came over my house two weeks later. It did not stop.;41.02823715847;-73.7677896174864
