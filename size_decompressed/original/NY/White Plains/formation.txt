I was a Police Officer on duty (now retired) with a partner in the car besides me when I looked into the nighttime sky and saw this hugh shape with lights spaced intermittently crossing the dark sky. No noise was heard and it was not like the shape of anything I had ever seen (flying) before. It seemed to have taken up the whole sky. Upon seeing this thing I brought it to my partners attention and when he witnessed it his spoken words were oh man, don't get me involved with this. After little thought (realizing there would be many jokes and ridicule aimed at me) I radioed HQ's and told them my sightings. They asked my location and I told them same. They came back with a reply that they had gotten many other phonecalls from the same area seeing the same thing. They (HQ's) then said they had called the Westchester County Airport and was advised it was the Air Force. To this day I dont believe that. Not being involved with Airplanes or anything as such I know I have never seen anything like this object flying in the air or anything close to it in shape. It seemed to be the size of a football field. It seemed to have taken up the whole sky. Believing in what I saw I made an official Police Report on same. My partner would not admit anything for years, for what ever reason, until finally one day he started to back up my story and admit to what we had seen. I know this happened many years ago but I never told anyone (other than by mouth)and except for the written  P.D. report......in any Official manner.       Thankyou;41.02823715847;-73.7677896174864
Cluster of orange lights in formation in night sky.;2018-06-16 22:50:00;10 minutes;Cluster of orange lights in formation in night sky. Stepped outside to walk dog and looked up to see orange lights on night sky approaching and following a northern flight pattern.  Objects were small, round, soundless and clustered in two to three at a time and space between seemed to be 15 to 30 second delays.   There were other aircraft in area of normal altitude and sound but these seemed higher and without any sound as they flew over in northern flight pattern directly over Ridgeway in White Plains.   Night was clear with new moon and minimal clouds.  Witnessed by two persons.;41.02823715847;-73.7677896174864
