Small disk near Westchester Airport;2002-08-21 18:30:00;10 seconds or less;Small disk near Westchester Airport My 12-year old daughter and I were heading home from a visit to Rye, and I was having trouble finding the entrance to the Merrit Parkway.  We drove around the area near the Westchester County Airport, going down one road, turning around and trying another road, etc., for about 15 minutes.  At one point, I pulled into the entrance to the Westchester County Airport (Airport Rd.) and made a U-turn there to get back onto the main road (Route 120A).  I turned left out of the airport entrance onto 120A South, and as I completed the turn I saw something on my left, quickly approaching my car.  My daughter saw it too.  It looked like a small disk, no more than 12 inches or so in diameter, and it was rapidly spinning vertically and moving towards us.  It was dark in color (brown?) but had a metallic quality, and as it passed the car it made a strange sound.  Not a buzz, or a motor-like sound.  More of an electronic sound that changed pitch as it approached my car, then hovered for a second just at the left side of my windshield, very close to the driver's side window, and then quickly disappeared.  We both saw and heard the exact same thing.  It lasted only a few short seconds, but it remains very clear in both of our minds.  There was no one else around, no traffic, no houses, no people.  We didn't actually see it disappear it just flew quickly away and wasn't in sight anymore.;41.02823715847;-73.7677896174864
