Appearance of odd shaped bright white/red spherical light with rapid extreme random movements  in night sky.  ((Venus??));2005-12-14 19:00:00;40 minutes;Appearance of odd shaped bright white/red spherical light with rapid extreme random movements  in night sky Noticed incredibly bright object in low west sky.  Husband commented that it was probably moon or planet.  I continued to observe this bright through binoculars.   Suddenly, I noticed that it became even brighter with a red area on the bottom side. (It's shape was somewhat spherical)  The light began to weaken until it disappeared completely.  I picked up the binoculars about 5 minutes later in an attempt to relocate it and did indeed find it but the light was not as strong as it had originally been.  I also noticed three very small stars to its right. Once again It then began to brighten and move OUT OF THE RANGE OF MY BINOCULARS causing me to try to relocate it again.  I finally did and by this time it was to the right of the stars. (It never returned to its position by the stars.)  The light moved quite rapidly in all directions (would backtrack also) for the duration of the sighting which made it somewhat difficult to track.  During this period the light never retained its original brilliance but remained reddish in color and was constantly blinking (actually, sputtering is a better term. Blinking would have been more uniform but this movement was not). It finally disappeared about 7:40 quite a distance from its original position. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been looking at Venus.  PD));42.7467;-76.673
