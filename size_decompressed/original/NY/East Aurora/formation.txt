Lights formation over 400 expressway East Aurora, NY;2013-08-30 20:30:00;5 minutes;Lights formation over 400 expressway East Aurora, NY Driving down 400, just before E.Aurora exit I noticed a lot of lights (white/faint yellow) in the sky. I rolled down my window to get a better look and it was still there and looked the same (well brighter/clearer because the window was down, but the obvious formation remained) I almost stopped on the highway but didn't want to look like a crazy person.   Then my gf said, Do you see those lights? What is that?  We both saw them/it, it was really weird!  It looked like multiple lights forming one shape/formation because the individual lights seemed to kind of wobble/stray or hover, they all didn't move perfectly in unison.  This is kind of what it looked like:  *  *  *  *  *  * *                  * *                    * *                    * *                  * *                * * * *     * * * *      * ** * * *  any one else?
