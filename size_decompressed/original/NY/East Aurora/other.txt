I could not see it well or make out what it was.   I thought it might have been a helicopter as it was hovering, but did not stay in the same spot for long, kind of odd erratic movement.   It suddenly went sideways off to the left (eastward) as if the wind was blowing it.  Got a better look at it and it appeared to look like a branch type stick, was in a lateral position.   It then moved upward into the clouds and disappeared.;42.7713000000002;-78.6059
