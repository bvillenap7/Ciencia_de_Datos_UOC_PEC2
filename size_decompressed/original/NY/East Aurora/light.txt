Bright, hovering, purple/green light that turned red and slowly fell to the ground.;2015-10-17 21:20:00;2 minutes;Bright, hovering purple/green light that turned red and slowly fell to the ground. While driving home I saw a big, bright, purple-green light in the sky that hovered and bounced around to the south. It did not flash, fly in a straight line, or make any noise. It was definitely not a plane.  It seemed lower to the ground than any plane I've seen in the sky. Then, as I was waiting at the red light the purple/green light turned red, hovered around a little more and then looked like it slowly started falling to the ground and out of sight behind the buildings, etc..  I didn't see any more of it after that, as I turned and was driving to the west.  However, I did keep checking to the south.;42.7713000000002;-78.6059
