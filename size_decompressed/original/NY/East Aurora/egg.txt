low eggshaped ufo two silhouttes in craft 50 feet over me;1970-04-15 21:30:00;5min;low eggshaped ufo two silhouttes in craft 50 feet over me i know this event happened some 34 years ago and i had reported once before but riomur had it the scientific org. was a front for the govt., i know paranoia but then again you could be too.  well here goes,  i was 11 at the time and playing hoops in my backyard, my sister and mother were in the garage playing/doing ironing. i stopped after shooting a basket when i saw approximately 1/2 mile away a small egg shaped light aproaching , me from the nw. i thought wow thats a low airplane!. after another basket or two it had came within a 1000ft and i was alarmed to see it so low and yet no noise. i gathered it was low due to a cherry tree in our backyard being 10feet tall as the basketball hoop was 9ft. i started to get scared as i heard no noise and squinted to see it about 500 feet away and saw two silhouettes in the yellow lit background. i then froze as i watched this approx 25 feet actross craft glide over the tree about 50feet above the cherry tree and i saw one being standing as if its arms were leaning on a control board and the other being was sitting down. as it glided over and passed i gathered my senses and yelled to my sister to come quickly, but to no avail it had passed . she said she didnt see it but i was rather excited.;42.7713000000002;-78.6059
