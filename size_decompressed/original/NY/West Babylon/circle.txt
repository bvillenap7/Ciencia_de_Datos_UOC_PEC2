8 objects witnessed over Long Island, NY.;2016-06-17 21:40:00;12 minutes;8 objects witnessed over Long Island, NY. 1)  I was watching the Mets game.  2)  I always see planes from JFK's flight pattern from my vantage point on the couch of my home....the lights caught my eye because they weren't from a plane....it was glowing redish orange and they were not blinking like those from a jet plane.  As they came overhead they were completely silent.  I observed 8 of them...it was when I saw the 4th one, I went inside and grabbed my cellphone to record the rest of them. 3)  I knew they were not planes.  I live by an airport, and like I said, JFK's flight pattern is over my house and I am intimately familiar with jets lights and how they blink.  There's the wing lights and the headlights...these objects didn't blink.  They glowed and pulsed and were reddish-orange. 4)  They moved very slowly...much slower than a jet.  Then again....I couldn't gauge how high they were because it was dark out, but they were under the clouds at the time.  They seemed to go in a perfectly straight line and controlled manner.  The two I have in one frame on video flew in a formation and never strayed from each other. 5)  I really didn't have a reaction other than I knew these were not airplanes or helicopters or anything that is currently known to man.  This is not my first UFO encounter either...I've seen silver orbs during the day before...I just never got them on cell phone. 6)  I lost sight because they eventually went beyond camera and eyesight.;40.7135;-73.3546000000001
