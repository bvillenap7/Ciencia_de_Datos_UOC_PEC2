((HOAX??))  I heard a sound and woke up to see a creature in a blue outfit in my house.;2015-02-04 00:00:00;2 minutes;I heard a sound and woke up to see a creature in a blue outfit in my house. Ok i was asleep in my apt in bed and i awoke to a strange whoosing sound. So i turned to my right and looked to see where it came from and i was in shock and very terrified to see a humanoid about 5'3 wearing a very blue spacesuit or something that covered its body except its neck and head.  It wore black boots up to its knee and it had the ugliest face and no neck.  Looked like its skin was melted or something.  Kinda green complextion and had a very sad look in its face which i found very odd like it was depressed or something.  Its eyes were black and beady.  It never moved just stood there in the bathroom doorway staring at me. I didnt know what to do.  If this thing was agressive or what so i yelled out of fear and tried to jump out of bed to get away but i couldnt move a muscle and passed out. I awoke about five hours later.  My left shoulder hurt bad.  And i found a lump on my right shoulder blade that wasnt there ever. I never had this experience befor! e and dont know why it happened to me.  But three days prior to this insident i remember seeing very clearly out my bathroom window a luminous base ball like object silently float past the window as i was cleaning the tile.  It was ghostly and its light left a trail behind it.  I thought that was very strange and thought nothing else about it then.  But now i wonder could it be how this alien spaceman found me in the first place?  I'm now concerned that it may come back and i hope not to ever see that ugly face again.  I havent slept since it happened im to afaid at this time.  Btw my cats were near me and looked at the being but paid it no mind.  I found that strange as well.  Usually they run and hide when folks they don't know come by.;40.7135;-73.3546000000001
