While driving north on Rt. 109 with my wife last night, we saw 3 green bright lights.  The lights appeared to be floating in place.   In a moment they shot across the sky.  I have never seen anything travel so fast.  Instantly the lights accelerated and disappeared from view. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
