It sped by at a fast speed, then disappeared before it was even out of view!  I initially thought it to be a comet, but it occurred to me that it had neither a tail, nor a bluish hue.  Also having seen a comet on multiple occasions, the explanation did not satisfy me.  For a brief moment, I thought it might have been a firefly, but they don't fly around in 20 degree weather on a December night. I now have little doubt in my mind that this was a UFO!  I searched out whether or not people had similar sightings, then I came upon this website. By the way, I live not too far from Montauk and Port Washington, both of them home to naval bases, and I've heard speculation of other weird happenings in those areas.;40.7135;-73.3546000000001
