My 2 books detail what I experienced that night;1985-09-15 22:00:00;Unknown;My 2 books detail what I experienced that night I had an experience that to this day I cannot explain and my wife experienced it with my while our 3 month old daughter was asleep. I have written 2 books about my experience on Amazon. They are called The Hudson Valley Sightings. I even made detailed pencil sketches of what took place exactly as I remember it. Here's another odd thing.I have every text file I ever wrote a book on except these 2 books. One night they were taken off my computer while I was in my office by some force I cannot explain nor could my friend explain it who was with me. In short: the files disappeared. If anyone in the UFO community would like to talk to me about this I can be reached at 352-((Number deleted)). My email is ((e-address deleted))@yahoo.com;41.4426;-73.6764
2 Triangular shaped craft in Putnam County;2001-11-11 20:04:00;2 mins;2 Triangular shaped craft in Putnam County There were two craft.  One appeared closer than the other and they were hovering over a near by mountain range.  The craft had lights positioned in a triangle formation around its perimeter.  THere was also one small light in the center of the triangle.  I was driving on the highway so I didn't get to see them for very long.  I imagine that they stayed there for longer than I was able to see them.;41.4426;-73.6764
2 red triangles flying close to the ground making no noise over Carmel;2014-12-27 21:55:00;8;2 red triangles flying close to the ground making no noise over Carmel Coming out of Carmel cinema, we saw 2 red triangles flying parallel closely to the ground, making no noise.   They were flying slowly and then one started to blink until it disappeared. Soon after the other one started to blink and disappeared over the woods.   Then driving home we saw 2 more and pulled into the parking lot at Carmel diner to get a better look.   They were traveling very low and very slow in the same direction as the other 2, towards Carmel theater until we lost sight of them.;41.4426;-73.6764
Triangle with 5 flashing lights.;2017-09-23 09:41:00;2-4 minutes;triangle with 5 flashing lights There were four lights in a straight line all flashing different colors or red, blue, and green.  a little bit in front of the line, there was one singular light that pulsated blue.   It started moving towards us after two minutes, and started to fly over us.  Right before it came over us, it emitted a sound that sounded like a dirt bike engine, then two side lights came on next to the big one.   We only saw one light with our eyes, but caught all 5 on camera.;41.4426;-73.6764
