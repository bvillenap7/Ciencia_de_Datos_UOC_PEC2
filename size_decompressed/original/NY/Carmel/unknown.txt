Shining light moving and then disappeared above Carmel New York;2012-04-06 16:41:00;10 seconds;Shining light moving and then disappeared above Carmel New York I was driving south on Horsepound road in Carmel, NY. In the sky to the south I saw a very brightly shining object moving across the sky.   At first I thought it could have been a plane, but it was moving across the sky much faster than commercial airplanes seem to, and it seemed like it was at a lower altitude.  Furthermore, it left behind no trail of any kind. I didn't think anything of it until it suddenly just totally vanished. I stopped my car and got out to look, I didn't hear anything and I couldn't see it or any trace of it again, although it should still have been well within my line of vision.  When it was in sight it was shining very brightly, but I could definitely make out its form, it had a shape to it, and it was very visible even if it hadn't been shining.;41.4426;-73.6764
