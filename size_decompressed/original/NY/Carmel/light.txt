Bright red lights flying west-east over Lake Carmel.;2015-01-01 00:24:00;10 minutes;Bright red lights flying west-east over Lake Carmel. After midnight, 12:24 am on January 1, 2015, I was on my back deck with my dog when I observed 2 bright red lights in the sky.  I thought at first they were fireworks, because of New Year's celebrations, but then they started to move horizontally across the sky, west to east.   I ran to get my daughter, who came outside with her daughter, and by that time the lights had moved across the sky to the front of the house and were disappearing over the trees.   Then we went back in the house, and as we were looking out the back window, we saw another of the same lights, flying in the same direction.    These lights seemed to flicker or change color, and were moving at the speed of a plane, but the lights were too large to be a plane.   When I first saw the two initial lights, they were very close to each other, then got farther apart as they moved east.  My only thought as to what this could be would be drones.;41.4426;-73.6764
