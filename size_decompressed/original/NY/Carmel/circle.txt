Driving on I-84, 1 mile east of Carmel, NY, on ramp from behind rock ledge at edge of hwy. approx. 50 ft. above hwy. appeared diffuse white light.  As light seemed to drift to spot directly above hwy., approx. 5 sec., it was morphing to a perfect circle of undulating flames of many, many colors. circle was approx. 100 ft. above hwy. and approx.  100 ft. in dia. we watched for approx. 5 min. circle then became smaller to dia. of approx.25 ft. and became solid white.  Circle then shot off to SE, as if a shooting star, gaining altitude and disappearing into space.  As witnessed by myself and two others.

Bright light flashing multiple colors hovered for about 4 minutes, it did a circle and then took off at an unreal speed.;2020-11-24 00:47:00;4 minutes;Bright light flashing multiple colors hovered for about 4 minutes, it did a circle and then took off at an unreal speed. It was very high in the sky. It was a little larger than what mars looks like when we can see it at night.  Hovering for about 3-4 minutes, flashing orange, red, yellow and green.  After 3-4 minutes it did a circle and then took off into space at a physically impossible speed and left behind a trail of light as it zoomed away.  I have a picture showing it’s a ring with an open center and a blurry video that shows the colors flashing.  I don’t know where I can submit this to but I put it on social media.;41.4426;-73.6764
A flashing circle came back in the sky going back and forth flashing different colors while turning on and off.;2020-11-24 01:45:00;10 minutes;A flashing circle came back in the sky going back and forth flashing different colors while turning on and off. I saw the first one around 1 hour earlier at 12:47am.  I already submitted that story.  I woke back up an hour later and this one seemed to be much lower, but farther away.  It was flashing on and off so my camera could barely pick it up.  If I hadn't already seen the one before I would have thought it was a planet, but this one was moving back and forth turning on and off.  When it was on it was flashing yellow, orange, red and green.  It went under the tree-line before I could see it take off again.;41.4426;-73.6764
