Tree covered hill. 1860' MSL. I awoke to see a bright white light approx 1,500' so east of my camper. The circular object resembled a satellite dish antenna. It was illuminated and, illuminating. It was rising very slowly. The above description was seen through 10x50 binoculars. The object was rising slowly and, shortly after focusing on it, began to descend. It began to rise again, then descended below the tree tops. The object never rose more than what I believed to be more than half way above the trees. I was able to see three full panels and,one  partial panel on either side of the three full ones. The trees obscured the lower half. On the second descent into the trees, the light disappeared. In the morning light, I went to where I believed the source of the light was located. There was no road or, trail suitable for positioning that object in the trees by using ground equipment, in my opinion The panels I speak of were white and, appeared to be illuminating.They also appeared to be illuminated.Try to imagine a TV satellite dish approx. 15 to 20 ft in dia. projecting half way above tall tree tops bathed in white light. My interest is in knowing if anyone has seen anything similar.;42.4986;-74.6109
