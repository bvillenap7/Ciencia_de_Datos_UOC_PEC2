5 brights shaped like an upsidedown V or triangle over Holley Ny.;2011-02-23 19:50:00;2:00 min;5 brights shaped like an upsidedown V or triangle over Holley Ny. I just got back from picking up my pizza for dinner.  As i was walking from my car to the house something caught my eye in the sky.  It was five bright clear lights that looked like a upside down V or triangle.  This shape was huge and took up a large part of the sky.  Everything was silent and the sky was crystal clear with stars everywhere.  The lights i seen were brighter than the normal stars in the sky.  After watching for at least one minute the V or triangle shape shifted and slowly moved to my right and dissapeared into the horizon.  All i could see was the bright lights moving insink, all around the lights was complete blackness.  Whatever I saw was big.  Too big to be an airplane, and had no sound.I was pretty cool and scary at the same time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
