How the extremely bright light effected my vision!;1990-04-15 22:00:00;5 mins;How the extremely bright light effected my vision! I was driving home from doing an home alarm repair job on the sawmill pkwy heading back to my home in NJ, southbound I noticed to my right (west) above the mountains a very brilliant white/blue light so bright it was only slightly less than a welders torch! I followed it as it moved similar pace to my 60mph driving speed as I watched off and on while driving (no shoulder to pull over on) the wierdest thing,and I never heard anyone ever descire this one before,my vision changed to everything having a green tint to it the road signs the road other headlights from on coming cars! as if I was wearing a green filter over my eyes,It really scared me for a while it started to wear off after about a half hour or so, but the only thing I could think of was that bright light I was observing!;41.1208;-73.7845
Bright flickering light up in sky. Looked down, looked back, gone.;2008-04-24 19:49:00;10 seconds;Bright flickering light up in sky. Looked down, looked back, gone. Driving southbound on Columbus Ave. A bright light was in the sky. Thought very bright star, but flickering too much and no other stars seen in sky yet. Watched it flicker for about 10-15 seconds, as road had clear view of sky in front of me. I looked down at the road, looked back up and it was gone with no trace in sight. Definately not a plane, helicoptor, star, or planet.;41.1208;-73.7845
