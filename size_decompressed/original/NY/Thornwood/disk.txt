Saucer shaped UFO with red and white flashing lights;2020-01-10 06:35:00;3 minutes;Saucer shaped UFO with red and white flashing lights I was driving to work in my hilly neighborhood.  I saw some lights in the sky.  At first I thought it was a helicopter.  I stopped the car to focus more on this object and realized it was a UFO. It had red and white flashing light on it.  It was still in the sky, as to be hovering. I continued to watch it. It then moved to the right and stopped and was hovering again. I got on my car phone to call my husband and told him to go outside and see if he could see it but he could not see anything. Then the spacecraft took off and vanished. It was large in size, round and a typical saucer shape that you would see in photos of UFOâ€™s. There was no noise coming from the aircraft;41.1208;-73.7845
