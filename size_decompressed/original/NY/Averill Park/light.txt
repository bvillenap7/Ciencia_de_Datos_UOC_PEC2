((HOAX??))  they looked like stars but were moving in all different directions.;2009-01-28 23:00:00;hour or more;they looked like stars but were moving in all different directions Well I was at the drive IN’s watching a movie and after the first movie was over I laid on my back and started to look at the stars.  While I was looking up at the sky, which was very clear do to the lack of light in the area I could see about for dots moving at extreme speed but the dots didn’t disappear.  They would shot to the left or right and come back to about the same spot.  I couldn’t make out shapes because they looked exactly as stars but you could tell it wasn’t because of the movement.  This continued for a while and after about 5 minutes I told my girl friend to make sure I wasn’t going crazy and she seen the same thing.  It was kind of scary but at the same time I didn’t want to look away but I made myself because I didn’t have a camera or anything so I didn’t think anyone would believe me.
