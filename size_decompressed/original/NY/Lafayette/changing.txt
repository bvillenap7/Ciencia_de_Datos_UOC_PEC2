I was driving West on Route 20 between Pompey and Lafayette, NY when directly in front om, approximately 15 feet in the air were 4 bright blue lights in the shape of a square.....I stopped my car and opened my window and there was a very loud noise...then all the lights turned red and the shape changed to a diamond shape. The object moved at a rapid rate of speed, then all the noise stopped...silence..then the object disappeared from view. Myself and my two children ages 13 and 11 witnessed this.;42.8923;-76.1104
