Strange light disappears.;2013-09-25 19:30:00;5 minutes;Strange light disappears. Around 7:30 my son and I went to look at the sunset and take some photos as it was particularly beautiful. Once down we were walking home and we saw the first of the stars come out as it was getting darker. Venus was obvious as was another, slightly brighter light almost due west approx 25 degrees off the horizon.  I figured it was another of the planets and was pointing it out to my son. We watched it for a little while until I figured it would get lost in the clouds that were slowly moving in. However when the clouds covered it, the light was still visible.  The planets surely aren't bright enough to shine through the clouds, so we kept watching until it suddenly winked out. The light was constant, not moving, not blinking. The sun was at such an angle that craft over 30k feet were leaving bright contrails. For the next half hour we watched and it didn't reappear, nor were other craft visible from the approximate location.;42.8923;-76.1104
