My  husband first observed object that appeared as a red burning ball with no tail.  He called for me to come up to our 2nd floor window to look.  The object was moving  horizontal to the northwest and not descending.  I thought it was a plane on fire that was going to crash.  It then disappeared behind our neighbors house and was no longer in sight. My husband & I both went to college and have resided in our home for 40 years.;40.6597999999999;-73.6371
