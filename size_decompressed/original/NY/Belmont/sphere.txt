Orange sphere, zig-zag, hover, dissapear;2012-07-17 00:00:00;20 seconds;Orange sphere, zig-zag, hover, dissapear My friend and I were sitting in my backyard by my shed looking at the sky and I noticed an orange sphere shaped object much like Jupiter that was bigger than the stars around it.  It hovered for 5-10 seconds and then went straight up in a zig-zag motion.  And took the remaining time to cover a good portion of the visible sky time flying up and left through the sky before disappearing.   There were no blinking lights on this which rules out aircraft.
