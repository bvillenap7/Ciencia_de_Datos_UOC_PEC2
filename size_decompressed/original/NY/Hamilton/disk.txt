Rotating Saucer shaped object with lights hovered in place;2020-10-24 19:34:00;1-2 minutes;Rotating Saucer shaped object with lights hovered in place We were eating supper when our 12 yo child looked out the window and thought she saw a shooting star. She paused for a few moments then mentioned to my husband and I that it wasn’t moving. My husband then looked out the window and said, ‘what the h*ll is that?!’  I got up from my seat and went to the window and saw a very large object in the sky, with large blue/white lights evenly spaced apart. There were approximately 10-15 lights all moving in unison. I could see the object rotating. My husband and I ran outside to get a better look and i could clearly see the saucer shape with the lights affixed to the edge of the object.  The object had been hovering in place for at least 20 seconds from the time we all saw it, until we were in our driveway looking at it. It tilted left for a few moments, then leveled, then tilted right. It then backed away from us towards Otselic/Lebanon then moved quickly to our left towards Smyrna. The object again hovered for about 5 seconds, its lights could still be seen beyond the clouds for several seconds when all of the lights suddenly disappeared.  During the course of all of this, a smaller airplane sized object moved at incredible speed ahead of the object. We do not know if they are related, but it moved faster than any plane we’ve ever seen in the sky.;42.8199;-75.54
