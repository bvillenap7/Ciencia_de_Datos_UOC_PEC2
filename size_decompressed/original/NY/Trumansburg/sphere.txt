It was completely silent and left behind a light trail. Around 1am I stepped out to my porch for a cigarette. It was very clear, lots of stars.  Before I could even light my cigarette I was startled by a big, bright, low flying sphere of light passing overhead.  It moved faster than I've ever seen anything move through the sky and was completely silent.  It was too low and far too big to be a shooting star.  I stood outside for over half an hour hoping to see it again but it never came back.;42.5203;-76.6715
