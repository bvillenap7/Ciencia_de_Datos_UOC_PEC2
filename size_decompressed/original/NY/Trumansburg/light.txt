moving light disappears in starry sky;2000-07-20 23:00:00;5 minutes;moving light disappears in starry sky The time is approximate.  As I am not familiar with this area, I can't say which direction I was facing when I spotted a 'star' moving at a steady pace in a straight horizontal line.  I watched the light move, thinking it was simply a plane when it disappeared from view, as if it went behind a door.  There were no clouds visable and many 'real' stars were shining brightly in the area where this light disappeared.  In order to give the best indication of direction,  the big dipper was slightly behind my left shoulder as I watched the light. I'd be interested in finding out if it was a satellite or plane.;42.5203;-76.6715
