Small bright, colorful flashing objects seen in Chittenango, NY.;2013-09-03 22:44:00;2 minutes;Small bright, colorful flashing objects seen in Chittenango, N.Y. My 2 sons, my wife and myself saw 2 u.f.o.s of approximately 15 inches each flashing red, yellow, blue and green about 23 yards from us and about 4 feet to 10 feet from the ground.  They circled each other in an almost playful manner darting around and then left.  Never saw anything like that before.  My son captured some of it on his phone.  They were quiet. Each one had about 8 colorful circles flashing.  They were not drones or any toys. They were fast.;43.0512;-75.8779
