Then I watched it move and thought it was a Chinese lantern. But the it moved side to side and the did small circles and up and down. It moved higher in the sky very slowly and was even with the moon and then moved closer to moon. Watched it until 3:45 , woke up daughter and wife and the watched it with me. I then observed another due south and it moved in the same slow way as the other. Both we emitted light , but had no  flashing lights like a plane. Observed 2nd one for 15 minutes. Tomorrow is a work day time to sleep;43.0512;-75.8779
