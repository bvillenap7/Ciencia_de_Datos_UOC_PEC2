Two orange triangle craft flying at aprox. 100' in altitude. Craft flew east to west. I was aprox. 200-300' from them when they flew over. I noticed no distinguishing features such as windows or lights or markings, just the shape and color. The crafts were elluminated by street lights and the lights of the restaurant's parking lot. They made no noise at all. They were side by side with the craft farthest from us displaying a wobbling motion (rocking wing tip to wing tip). The aprox. speed was 50-60 mph. We were noticing the stars and how light pollution free the sky was when I noticed the craft aproaching from the East.;43.0512;-75.8779
