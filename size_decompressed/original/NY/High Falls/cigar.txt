Figures seen.;2013-01-17 23:00:00;1-2 hours;Figures seen At like 11:30, a few of my friends and I were at my parents party.  We weren't drunk or high. We saw 3 cigar formed flying objects with green, yellow, and purple lights flashing erratically above the main falls. They weren't very high up, but they were high enough.  They were silent, and moving in a very glitchy type of movement. After that we began to see figures coming up the hill.  They looked like just blank black forms.  They didn't look like human figures, they were curvy.  Please. Some one come and investigate this manner. I am scared to sleep now.  Once in a while I still see them...I'm only 17, and I know what I saw. I am not sure that they weren't people. It was dark.
