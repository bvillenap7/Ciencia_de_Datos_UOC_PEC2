Blinking, waivering aircraft that shoot off and disappear,;2014-12-27 20:00:00;3 hours;Blinking, waivering aircraft that shoot off and disappear, For two years in the night sky we have seen in various positions, stationary objects with blinking lights (red, blue, green) flashing.   These objects spontaneously jump left and right, waive ring, also up and down, then disappear. In the last two nights, a half mile away, one seems grounded in a distant pasture, going up and down for hours.   We finally drove the road, North Tower Hill, only to see it until we got closer, go completely out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
