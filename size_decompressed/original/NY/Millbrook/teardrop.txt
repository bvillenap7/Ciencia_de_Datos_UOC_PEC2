I was driving down the road with my cousin, when I saw a triangle looking set of lights.  I thought it was odd to see them there.  I drive through there frequently and I have never scene anything like it before.  So, I pulled over, at which point my cousin said the lights must have belonged to a cell tower just over the trees.  Then the triangle started to move, very slowly hover around.  It didn't make a sound.  I couldn't believe it, but for some weird reason, rationalized it as a military hovering plane.   After watching it is awe for a couple of minutes we left for home.;41.7779;-73.6928
