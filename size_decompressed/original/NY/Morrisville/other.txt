Bright/fast moving object in the night sky;2009-06-24 22:00:00;30 seconds;Bright/fast moving object in the night sky The sighting occurred around the time of 10:00 PM, it was a clear night and I had decided to lay in my yard and view the sky. The sky was dark and dotted with stars, planes slowly moved across the sky. I continued to watch the sky for a good thirty minutes or so until I saw something out of the ordinary in the sky. What I saw was a sudden bright light at first I thought it was just a bright star but the more I looked I realized it wasnâ€™t a star at all. The light was not a fiery white blaze a meteor would normally generate, it instead looked as though something was shining a huge bright spotlight in the sky towards my directing. The flying object was not bearing any strobe light or light a plane would normally carry and not giving off any loud chopping noise a helicopter would generate and was not giving off a roar a jet would normally create. The light it was giving was too bright and massive to be any airliner as well. As I strained my eyes to make out the light on the aircraft it suddenly turned to the left so I could get an almost clear view of its side. With the light no longer focused in my direction I strained to view what appeared to be a long cylinder-like object with a red light on what I assumed was its front. Soon the red light dimmed to such an extent that it was impossible to decipher where it exactly was in the sky.;42.9146;-75.648
