We heard a boom and saw a flash across the bay.  Just south of that we witnessed an bright orange lit object rise slowly from an area at the Vanderbilt Mansion in Centerport.  It rose vertically like a helicopter, no noise.   We assumed a well lit helicopter until it reached above tree level and took off at LIGHTENING SPEED at a 30 degree angle west north west, disappearing just as fast.  We looked at each other in disbelief.  It took a few moments to even process what was seen.   We realized that it had actually risen from the bay right in front of the mansion, and no noise was heard.   Being it is a Bay, sounds echo and resonate as closer usually.   I still am shocked at what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Hence, we are unable to contact the party, to confirm the date.
