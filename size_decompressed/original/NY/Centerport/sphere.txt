They were moving in a slight arch across the sky from northwest to southeast.  My girlfriend has a cottage on water just south of the Milll Dam Bridge & I've been I've been going there for four year's & am familiar with the flight patterns.  These objects seemed to be following each other in a path not taken by normal air traffic.  They moved very fast and made no noise.   I was calling for my girlfriend to come out to see then ran in to get her, but they were gone by the time she got to look.;40.8941;-73.374
