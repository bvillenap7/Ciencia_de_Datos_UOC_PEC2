Triangular shape emerging from cloud spotted in NY.;2009-05-15 15:00:00;02:00;Triangular shape emerging from cloud spotted in NY. I was traveling east from the area of Saddle River, NJ heading towards Park Ridge, NJ when I spotted a triangular shape emerging from a cloud bank. It was black in color and approximately 200 feet from end to end (based on the size of the cloud it was emerging from).  The shape was not moving and just appeared to be poking out from the cloud.   I continued without stopping and did notice it again on another rise in the road, but could not find it again after about 5 minutes.;41.0416;-73.9572
