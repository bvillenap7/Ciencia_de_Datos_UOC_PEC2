It had 4 flashing bright yellow lights on each end I was in bed listening to Coast to Coast AM, which I normally do when I can’t sleep.  Glanced outside my bedroom window and saw a object flying lower than normal aircraft.  It had a flashing bright yellow light on each of its 4 corners end a small red light near one of the yellow lights.  It was travelling south.  It could have been a drone, but did not appear to be a Cessna style plane, just a bit smaller, the lights were very bright.  Can’t recall if it made a noise.;41.0416;-73.9572
