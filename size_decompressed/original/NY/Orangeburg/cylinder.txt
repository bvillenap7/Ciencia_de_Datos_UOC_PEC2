I observed one object a long cylindrical row of round white lights about 10 in all.  The object was in a stationary hovering position about 1000 to 2000 feet high.  I saw it as I was traveling North on the Palisades Interstate Parkway at the New Jersey / New York border.  As I was traveling downhill I saw a row of lights at what I thought were on the mountains/ hills ahead of me.  I thought it was a new building or athletic field all lit up at night.  As I was descending the hill I realized it was in the sky. All of sudden there was a flash of yellow light and the object was gone.  The flash was just centered around the object.  It did not light up the whole panorama of the sky like a sudden flash of lightning does.  That's when I realized I had probably just seen a UFO.  I traveled another 15 Minutes on the same road and saw nothing in the way of lightning or flashes in the sky. I am a 55 year old Television Director that lives in Rockland County, New York.! I have a BA degree in History and Art. I was not drinking prior to the sighting and was fully alert.;41.0416;-73.9572
