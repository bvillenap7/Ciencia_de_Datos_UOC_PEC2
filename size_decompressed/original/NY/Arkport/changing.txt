Bright light noted in the western sky.  It moved rapidly to the left, after hovering in its initial location for 3-5 minutes.  It then seemed to make circular movements as it moved from right to left and then back again.  It seemed to maintain approximately the same attitude in the sky. Shape seemed to change initially from a triangular pattern and then became rounder as it moved forward.  Video tape of the event used ground marker lights to note its movement. Image data will be emailed later today after I return from work. ((NUFORC Note:  We would like to see the video.  We wonder whether the witness might have been looking at Venus, but that is a guess.  PD));42.4254;-77.6938
