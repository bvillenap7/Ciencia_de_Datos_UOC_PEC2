seen large bright orb in western sky;2010-11-06 16:00:00;1 min;seen large bright orb in western sky While driving up oak hill road arkport n.y. seen a large bright orb and a smaller one to the left of it . If you were to compare size with a regular star this would be the size of a hard ball baseball.  At first thought it might be a star then realized that there was complete cloud cover behind them.  They were in the western sky.  They were very bright 10 times brighter than a star, that is what caught my eye in the first place. Had to keep eyes on road so have no idea what hapened to them.  All I know is I've never seen any object in the sky that stood out like these did . ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.4254;-77.6938
