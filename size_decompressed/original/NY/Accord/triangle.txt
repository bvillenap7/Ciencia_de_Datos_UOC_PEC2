My son and I were at the Accord laundra-mat, just off US Hwy-209, in the appoximate evening of June 16, 1977.  It was warm and the night was very clear with lots of stars out.  We went outside to look at the constellations and spotted a very bright star which we thought was Venus as the last glow of the setting sun lit the horizon a bright but dark blue which made the star stand out.  As we watched, the star got brighter and bigger.  It was moving slowly towards us.  As it came closer, there was not a sound to be heard.  The shape was triangular and it was low enough we could see lights across the bottom in a V shape, red on one side and green on the other.  There were no flashing lights, all were steady and the bigh white light on the front of the V shape.  There were several other people at the laundra-mat as well as some residents across the street that witnessed the event.  We were all puzzled at what we were looking at.  The main item being that it did not make a sound but just sort of glided slowly across the sky.  It was traveling from west to east in a straight line.  Accord NY is about 30 or so miles from what was at that time Newburgh Air Force base.  The thought of it being a new military craft crossed my mind, but at that time we did not have anything 'known' that would resemble the craft.  The zip code is for Stone Ridge NY, where we were living at the time, not Accord. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.8083;-74.2353
