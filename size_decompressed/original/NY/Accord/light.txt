The 3 craft were approx. 5 degrees apart ( measured with closed fist at arms length.) They were moving at an incredible rate of speed but left No trail. They were either in high altitude orbit or further judging the Arc angle they took down toward the horizon of the North. The entire experience lasted approx 2 minutes indicating that the craft were Far from our planet and indicating rediculos speed as they moved among the stars. All 3 were brightly lit. The light from each never deviated ,except for the usual atmospheric interference which gave them a slight twinkle. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the three U. S. Navy NOSS satellites, which currently are being reported from multiple witnesses across the U. S..  PD));41.8083;-74.2353
