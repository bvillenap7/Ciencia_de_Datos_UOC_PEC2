Sighting:   Time:  Approximately 9:25pm EST  Date:  November 3rd, 2014  Location:  Johnson City, NY, neighborhood of of Oakdale Road and Watson Boulevard. As my son and I were traveling west on Watson Boulevard, away from the Oakdale Mall, I noticed an object with red and white lights, a cube or sort of square shape, hovering near a power line tower. The lights were static and were not blinking. I slowed down my car to about 15 mph to try to understand what it was.   It appeared to be about 500 feet or more above ground.  It was large, but not huge. My son was in the front passenger seat, and rolled down his window to get a better view. I kept looking and driving slowly and then looked away so I could stay on the road. My son kept watching it.  He said he thought it was the size of about 3 cars. My son also said that it began to move in a north, north east direction. There was no sound whatsoever. I finally turned the car around and pursued the direction we saw it traveling in. We drove up Oakdale Road for about a mile and a half until we lost sight of the object.  Anonymous;42.1266999999999;-75.9685000000002
