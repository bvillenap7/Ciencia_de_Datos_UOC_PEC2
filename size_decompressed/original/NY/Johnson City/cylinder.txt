Silver flying cylinder.;2006-10-05 10:38:00;2 minutes;Silver flying cylinder. I saw a sliver cylinder fly from West to North at a 45 degree angle at NW.  It has no exhaust or wings.  It flew behind clouds and popped back through at times.  It was going quite fast, faster than a jet.  It was very high up (miles in fact).  This is not the first time that I have seen somethin glike this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));42.1266999999999;-75.9685000000002
