Circular craft cross sky, stops, and flies off;2003-09-27 19:25:00;3 minutes;Circular craft cross sky, stops, and flies off A circular craft, far up in the atmosphere was seen starting from a dead stop in the western sky, flying quickly to almost directly above me, and then stopping for about 10 seconds.  The craft then made an abrupt change of flying quickly towards the north-north-east direction until it passed behind a building near the horizon. The craft was one single color of white-yellow.  No windows could be seen.  It was not a plane since it lacked the blinking wing lights.  Like I said, it was farther up in the atmosphere than planes fly, but still lower than the ISS or satelites that we watch go by.  When it moved in the beginning, I had taken it for a star since I was staring at the part of the sky for quite a few minutes.  It moved across half of the sky in only 1 minute-90 seconds, stopped for 10 seconds, and made a 120 degree angle turn.  What aircraft do we have that can pull this off? None!  Circular and cylindar craft have been seen in this are many times recently.  When will this be researched?  I a middle aged professional, do not take drugs, hardly ever drink, and have no psychological problems.  It just seems funny that people in the Southern Tier of NY report all of these craft, but never make it to the newspapers or TV stations.;42.1266999999999;-75.9685000000002
A brite lite;2003-11-23 20:45:00;7 min;A brite lite My self and a friend were out for a smoke on my front porch.  I happened to look across the road into a fleid and saw a bright white lite with little white lites circling around it.  It moved north toward an airport about 2-3 miles away by air. It went behind some bushes and we waited. two mins passed and we were about to go back inside when it came back into sight heading south veary slowly,  It then stoped and jetted into space at light speed.  I have been seeing things like this for a while.  The first time 3 years ago and 4 with in 3 weeks.  Want to know more e-mail me at ((e-address deleted));42.1266999999999;-75.9685000000002
