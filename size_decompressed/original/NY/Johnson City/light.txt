Bright light traveling over Johnson City, NY heading over Binghamton 5/22/08;2008-05-22 19:50:00;12 sec;Bright light traveling over Johnson City, NY heading over Binghamton 5/22/08 I observed the light approximately one mile from earth while looking up. It was bright and stayed bright until the trees by my house blocked my view. There were no flashing lights like an airplane or helicopter. It just was bright. It traveled at a steady speed about that of a helicopter. There was no sound. At first I thought it might be a helicopter going to the hospital but it didn’t turn. It just went in a straight line. I didn’t have time to get my camcorder because I was trying to figure out just what it was.;42.1266999999999;-75.9685000000002
Three lights (blue, green, unknown) flying one after another in a curved path from south to north, at extremely low altitude.;2015-04-19 21:33:00;30 seconds;Three lights (blue, green, unknown) flying one after another in a curved path from south to north, at extremely low altitude. Three lights crossed the sky at a high speed, one after another, flying very low below the clouds from south to north.  The first was very distinctly blue and appeared to be circular in shape.  It was followed a few seconds after by a green light traveling at a similar high speed and low altitude, it's path curving slightly to follow the first.   About 20 seconds after, the first two lights were followed by a third of indistinguishable color, flying at a similar speed but slightly higher altitude.  Witnesses include myself and my two roommates, out for a cigarette at around 9:30 pm.  I like to keep an eye on the sky, but I've never once seen anything strange like this.   Because the third light traveled at a higher altitude, it was a more conventional appearance...  But none of us can explain the appearance of the first two lights in particular.   It's difficult to draw an immediate conclusion, but the third seemed to be another type of flying object pursuing the first! two lights.;42.1266999999999;-75.9685000000002
