Egg-shaped object parallels plane.;2002-10-01 16:00:00;5 seconds;Egg-shaped object parallels plane. I remember this event in my mind rather vividly.  I was 8 years old, in my backyard.  It was still light out.  Plane traffic always flew over my house, and occasionally I'd look up and spectate.   With the attacks of the year earlier still etched fresh, I looked up at this one plane as I heard it clear.  I saw a plane and a spinning Egg/Football shaped vessel travelling to match speed and course of the plane (which was travelling South, assuming from Newark).  The object was paralleling the plane.   When I was looking at it for a few seconds, I went to my dad who was nearby and told him to look, but by then the object was gone.  The object was dark underneath as I was directly below it.  I could hear only the plane that was next to it. I recently discovered this site and noticed a similar report on this date.  While I am not entirely sure of the date itself, I do remember it being around a year after 9/11. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

While performing construction at a client's work site in Staten Island, i noticed an egg shaped silver metallic object hovering overhead.  I decided to take a video of it on my iPhone and brought it to my co-workers attention. The object seemed to be hovering, joined by 2 other objects of likeness, darting across the sky.  It was a bright and clear sunny day with full visibility.  Temperature of about 59 degrees.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553
