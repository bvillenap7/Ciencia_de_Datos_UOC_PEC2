I was smoking a cigarette on my balcony and I looked up at the sky as I usually do.  Newark airport is in the distance and a lot of planes fly by.   Plainly said.. a silvery/ white light shot across the sky and disappeared. I'm not sure its altitude, but it sure was as low as the planes!!!  Closest point of interest would be the staten island expressway. It was right overhead.  My balcony faces jersey and the airport. I assumed comet or cool shooting star...this was way too low to be either or!  All I know is, I'm gonna have a lil trouble sleeping.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553

I thought it was the moon but it was fluttering.  After a closer look and seeing the moon was in the opposite sky as where this was, and planes flying what looked to be way under it, i decided to snap a few pics.  The first 2 pics i took from inside the house out the skylight which has a screen.   I then went outside and took a clearer one. It deffinetly was not the moon, nor a plane or helicopter as it was hovering around same area fluttering away.   The area in the sky would be from about Gateway to Prince's Bay in Staten Island.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553

I was gazing at the different layers and colors of the clouds.  An airplane made its way across the sky on this bright, sunny evening, about 5:20 pm.  I give permission to use the photo sent by email, described below.  About 15 or 20 minutes later, a black aircraft flew much faster than an ordinary plane and caught my attention.  I quickly raised my cellphone toward the sky and took some pictures, hoping to catch a shot of that aircraft.  It was black and thicker in the middle, with smaller sections attached above and below the middle.  It flew south to north very quickly, and lower than the previous airplane.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553
