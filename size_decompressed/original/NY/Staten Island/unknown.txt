Huge bright fireball descends over Staten Island.;2011-10-01 00:00:00;10 minutes;Huge bright fireball descends over Staten Island. I live in NJ on the bay and can clearly see Staten Island from my bedroom.  Me and my brother both saw an orangey fireball slowly move across the sky, the descend below the horizon over Staten Island.  It moved to slow to be an airplane, and there are no airports in that area.  I have seen this object several times during October of 2011 and my brother is a witness to it as well. Me and my brother are both sane, honest young men, ages 25 and 18. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553
White light moving at extremely high speed and left a streak for a brief time of only seconds.;2014-07-26 03:05:00;4 seconds;White light moving at extremely high speed and left a streak for a brief time of only seconds. A low object emitting white light was spotted flying over my house last night in Staten Island NY at extremely high speed.  It occurred after I heard a strange noise coming from my driveway.   As soon as i was done investigating the sound i turned around and that is when I saw the white light.   It had to be under 1500 feet because the clouds were low last night and it was visibly flying below the clouds.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553
