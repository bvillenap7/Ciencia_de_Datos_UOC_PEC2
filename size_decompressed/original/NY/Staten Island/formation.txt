3 UFO'S flying above Staten Island home in Triangle Formation;2021-06-07 20:00:00;20 minutes;3 UFO'S flying above Staten Island home in Triangle Formation While at my hotel in Houston, TX I called my wife to greet her via Video call on Facebook Messenger. When she answered the call, she was outside in the backyard of our house in Staten Island, NY and told me that her and 3 of my children had just seen 3 UFO'S flying over our house and she was filming them. I asked her to send me the video and what I saw blew me away. The first section of the video my wife filmed through our living room window in which it shows 2 bright orange/yellow orbs steadily moving over the house. Once the orbs were out of view, my wife paused the video and went outside to the backyard to continue filming them. The video then switches to an outside view of the sky above our home and this time, 3 orange/yellow orbs could be seen. What really blew me away was that as soon as the 3 orbs came into view, one of the orbs on the far right sped up as if to catch up with the other 2 orbs. And then once a triangle formation was formed between them! , the orb on the right slowed down and the orbs then continued to move steadily in a formation away from our home.  I uploaded the video to my YouTube channel which can be seen here:  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=adLCH7L9Zk0;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553
