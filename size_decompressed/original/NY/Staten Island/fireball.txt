Object with a glowing blue shield and fire following seen in Staten Island, New York.;2013-03-22 19:56:00;10 seconds;object with a glowing blue shield and fire following seen in Staten Island, New York. I was waiting for my mother to open up the door and as I waited I looked up at the sky as I usually do to see the stars when I noticed a sort of circular object in the sky glowing with what looked like a blue light as a shield and fire that sparkled. It was too quiet and too close to have been an airplane or a helicopter. It was moving at a pace that was not too slow but was not lightning fast either. I tried to run down my porch stairs to take a picture but when I looked again, it was gone.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553

Flying against air traffic norms in the area .;2021-02-11 19:15:00;40 seconds;Flying against air traffic norms in the area . This is an area of NYC where plane routes are generally from south to north and its very busy with plane traffic since there are 3 major airports in the area. I was pumping gas at a station and for some reason I looked West and witnessed a fireball traveling from west to east not too fast. I said to a man pumping gas next to me and asked him Do you see that. He answered yes and stated   We need all the help we can at this point It definitely was not fireworks or a flare. because it kept the same steady trajectory until it was out of sight. It made no noise.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553
