Driving on the expressway Saturday 2/25/12 at 10:58 AM, I noticed a extremely bright, cigar shaped object very high up in the sky over NJ.  It was stationary and bright white.   There were planes flying below it landing and taking off from Newark Airport.   Suddenly, after watching the object for about a min., it started moving horizontally at an extremely high rate of speed, then disappeared.   The 2 cars infront of me were watching the object as I noticed them swerve.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553
Cylinder/cigar shaped bright white lighted front, 1/5 rear yellow light-  shot/flew past extremely fast and disappeared in 2-3 seconds.;2015-08-18 00:28:00;2-3 seconds;Cylinder/cigar shaped bright white lighted front, 1/5 rear yellow light-  shot/flew past extremely fast and disappeared in 2-3 seconds.   Heading South toward Outerbridge Crossing.  Looked like flying at much lower altitude than plane-but a bit higher than a helicopter.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553
Bright orange light, long and skinny, hovering over tree line at dusk that flew in a straight line and very fast.;2016-02-13 18:30:00;1 minute;Bright orange light, long and skinny, hovering over tree line at dusk that flew in a straight line and very fast. I'm from Denver, CO, and was visiting New York.  I took an Uber driver to Staten Island for sight seeing and visiting where my step mom was raised.  It was around 6:30-7:00 just getting dark, but with some light left in the sky.   As we were driving I look over to a tree line decently far in the distance and see a very bright orange-ish long and skinny light hovering in the sky above the tree line.  There was a plane as well flying above and a bit further in the distance from this object.  I could see the noticeable flashing lights of the plane and could clearly make out that it was a plane, therefore this object was even more odd and off looking.   A few seconds after looking at the bright object or light, it moved in a straight line fast, passing the plane then stopping again. I thought to myself did I really see that? So I pointed it out to the Uber driver, I asked him, Do you see that?!  He said yes and shortly after it moved again in a straight line very fast, we both said it's moving, it's moving!    Once again it stopped, then went off again and in like a flash it was gone.  Completely gone.  We both agreed it was something we could not explain and have never seen anything similar to it.  I still cannot explain this light, the way it moved, how fast it had moved, the way it looked or how it was there then gone.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553
