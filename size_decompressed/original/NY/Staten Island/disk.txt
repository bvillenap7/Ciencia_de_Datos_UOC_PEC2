A slow moving circular object with lights wish appeared to be like diamonds spinning around and around It was silent, moving towards the South.Various helicopters tried to approach it it moved abrubtly upwards, hundreds of feet away.  When the helicopters apparently gave up the search and departed, the object would return.It was a clear night happening on the bay where I lived in a high rise.  I was suggested by a former Army veteran to call the Air Force to report it.  They stated that they were working on it.   Next day there was a blackout where I lived and there was an article in the local newspaper that a bouncing yellow giant ball was seen on the beach which according to the article,  it was an apparent strange object such as an extra terrestrial object.

I look up, and behind the clouds I saw 4 lights far in the skys spread out in a (North) (South) (East) (West) position moving like Jets in Formation.   As it past right above me, I got a better look, and it was a circle shape craft the size of about 50 International Planes Combined.  I tried to follow it with my eyes, but it disapeered into the clouds.  I live next to an airport, and I see Airplanes everyday.  That far up in the sky, big planes look so tiny and move slow.  This craft was huge!  And moving as fast as a Jet.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553

Grey disk floating in the sky. Completely still, not moving at all.;2020-09-30 18:30:00;2 minutes;Grey disk floating in the sky. Completely still, not moving at all. Driving home from work southbound on 440, I saw a grey disk object In the sky.  This object was closer then a plain flying over would be and farther then a helicopter would be.  It looked to be a little bit bigger then a normal sized car and I could definitely make it out to be a disk or a saucer. I watched it for about a minute and a half trying to figure out what it was, and it stayed completely still.  It was so absolutely still that I couldn't believe what I was looking at. I called my brother, and we both had decided that I should pull over and take a picture.  Once I pulled over and opened my phone camera, it was gone.  The entire encounter lasted about 2 minutes.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553
