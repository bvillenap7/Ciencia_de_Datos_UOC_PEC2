A light glowed and grew bigger and bigger til it resembled the shape of a roundish triangle and it spun.;2012-07-24 22:30:00;5 minutes;A light glowed and grew bigger and bigger til it resembled the shape of a roundish triangle and it spun. It was at 2230hrs. From where I was right at the toll bridge (40° 36.1823 N  74° 03.3498 W) coming into Staten Island I saw an object 30 degrees SSW.  It was glowing brighter and dimmer. Eventually it glowed so bright it resembled the shape of a roundish trangular shape.  I saw it move downward to my 25degree angle.  I saw it spin and move West and it glowed brighter as it moved.  Then it just disappeared.  And then I got home and I saw it again and this time I was out of the car and I heard an echoing of wind and the next thing I saw, the light disappeared. I knew I couldn't have mistaken it for anything else. It was extremely cloudy I couldn't even see the stars!  Aircraft don't fly that low in the sky and their lights blink but this object didn't have blinking lights.  There wasn't any visible sight of the moon due to the clouds.  And even if there was the moon, the moon is never that low in the sky. I am 110% positive that it was an UFO.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553

04/18/2015 18:00  Bright, white, triangle appeared over Staten Island for an hour.;2015-04-18 18:00:00;1 hour;04/18/2015 18:00  Bright White Triangle Appeared over Staten Island for an hour. On Saturday, April 18, 2015, at around 8:pm EST, I looked out the window to watch the stars come out.  I noticed a brilliant white light, in a tall triangular shape, in the NW sector of the sky, from where I was located in a house atop a hill in the West Brighton neighborhood of Staten Island, NY. The light object was much brighter than the stars appearing, even brighter than a planet would normally look from the naked eye. Its shape was like a thin Christmas tree I observed a red spot on the top of the “structure,” white triangular long base, and three white dots positioned under the base.  From my perspective, the form was atleast five times larger than the other visible stars, and atleast two to three times bigger than planets I have seen in the night sky. The object appeared to be stationary.  I saw it scrunch down in size briefly, to approximately two thirds of its original size.  I was viewing it from inside the window at this time, and altered my position to see if it was a reflection, or distortion due to the screen, but I was seeing it from the clear pane of the window, above the half screen, in any case. I went outside to the front porch to view it again. It was still there (maybe ten minutes had passed), and had a soft white halo around it.  It stayed in the same place as I studied it from the porch, with no obstruction blocking or changing its image, as far as I could see. The tall triangular brilliant white object with the red top beacon, outshined the visible stars in the sky, as well as looking much larger than them (same size as listed before).  It remained in the same spot, as far as I could tell, for the duration of five minutes that I watched it.  I went back inside and checked it from the window.  No movement. I decided to check on the light shape the next hour, and when I looked out at 9:pm, the object was gone. On Tuesday, 4/21/15, I saw what appeared to be the same object, in the same basic spot.  It did look smaller, and this time I saw it slowly move away, towards and above Bayonne, New Jersey’s, skies, a bit further to the left of where I first saw it on Saturday 4/18/15.   It continued to move on a steady course, appearing to decrease in size, though I think that was due to it leaving the vicinity.  I lost sight of it when it moved to the left and my view was blocked by a neighboring building across the street.
