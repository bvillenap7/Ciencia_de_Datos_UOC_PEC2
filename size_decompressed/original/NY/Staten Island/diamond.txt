I came outside and noticed a black, silent UFO was hovering right above me at about 20 to 30 feet off the ground.  I then heard a machine sound, and it turned on a bright white light and shot upward.  I initially looked away because of the intensity of the light and when I looked up again, it appeared that it was hovering totally still at about 15,000 feet.  The shape appeared to be hexagonal or octagonal and the outline of it was all lit up with yellow light.  Next to it was a blurry streak of white light as if it had skidded to a stop or had blurred light somehow.  I did not have my phone in hand at the time and had no time to get it for any pictures.  I looked away for a couple of seconds and thought to myself 'I bet when I look back, it will be gone.'  It was.  I looked back and it was gone or dark.  I could not see it any longer.  My next thought was whatever it was, I bet it will be back. I was right, because at approximately 04:30 I began what seemed like lucid d! reaming.  I recalled my consciousness becoming illuminated and seeing internet pages and and stuff yet I was still asleep.  I had a thought like 'had I taken or been given some kind of drug that's causing this?'   I then heard or received a telepathic message assuring me that I had not.  It was like it read my thoughts. I then heard a machine-like noise in my head which woke me up completely.  I then felt a total sense of calm and silence.  Whatever it was had scanned me somehow.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553
