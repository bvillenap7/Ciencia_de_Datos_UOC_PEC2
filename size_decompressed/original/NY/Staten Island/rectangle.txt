3 huge lights over Staten Island that turned and sped off!;2009-08-01 22:00:00;<1 minute;3 huge lights over Staten Island that turned and sped off! I was out with a friend in Staten Island, New York around 10:00 P.M. one night in August, 2009.  We were driving to a gas station and stopped at a red light.  We looked up and high above the trees was a dark rectangular shape with three huge circular lights.  It was just hovering in one place.  We started screaming and I immediately went to grab my camera.  As I was doing so, the object slowly turned from horizontal to vertical and sped off incredibly fast.  There was no time to grab the camera. It was gone in an instant.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553
