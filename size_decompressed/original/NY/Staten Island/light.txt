I work nights on my way home as usual last night at 0338  hrs I observed a strange (cobalt) blue very bright light strea;2015-01-28 03:28:00;1 minute;Mr Davenport - I work nights on my way home as usual last night at 0338  hrs I observed a strange (cobalt) blue very bright light streak across the night sky very quickly.  I was traveling East to West on Forest Hill Rd between Holden Blvd & Jasper St. Staten Island NY 10314 area.   Out of the driver's left side window, the light caught my eye, as it streaked past my vehicle and I watched it either disappear or burn out while looking through the front windshield, it was also traveling East to West Just over the tree tops.  I was completely sober lol, as I said just driving home from work.   It reminded me of a shooting star I've seen many meteor showers in August near Lake George growing up.  But this was different it was much closer to the ground fire works height.  But I've never seen this color in fire works.  The tip of it appeared very dark black the body was an extremely bright cobalt blue with a long bright white tail that widened and sprayed out as it streaked across the sky.  No one else was driving on the road at this time.  The night sky was very overcast I could not see any other lights no stars, no moon either.  It happened so fast there was not enough time to take a picture with my phone.   I was listening to Coast to Coast on the radio and my window was rolled up, so I never heard a thing.   I'm leaning more towards something celestial not ET, but I've never seen those vivid bright colors in the sky before.  I would love to know what I saw.  I have made a report like this in my life.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553
Star of Bethlehem seen in sky over entrance to New York harbor.;2015-07-24 02:00:00;3-6 min;Star of Bethlehem seen in sky over entrance to New York harbor. Took my German Shepard for her usual middle of the night backyard walk.  My yard faces East looking over the entrance of Atlantic Ocean into NY harbor.  Almost a bright half moon [ oblong shaped ]was to the southern sky.  I know this sounds crazy, but above the normal air traffic patterns was the star of Bethlehem shining brighter than the moon.   I ran inside,got my wife, pointed up to it and it went from a bright white light to a greenish look, and in a second shot over to due south under the moon, then turned reddish,shot over to the west then turned blueish.  Then shot over to the North with a yellowish look and then right back to its original East position.  This thing was way up there and was huge.  It moved at impossible speeds around the entire sky, and not 1 plane in sight.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553
2-3 lights following eachother in the sky for 20 minutes where they moved from east to west.;2016-02-05 20:20:00;10 minutes;2-3 lights following eachother in the sky for 20 minutes where they moved from east to west. The lights appeared after I left the gym with my friend.  We were walking to my house after eating some food at a local restaurant when I spotted the Dim Lights in the sky.  I have video evidence I took on snapchat.  The flown in a wide circle in the sky.   It appeared as if they were following eachother and didn't stop, but we're moving in other spots in the sky, from east to west.  I went in my house and when I came out about 10 minutes later there was three, two side by side and one they were following;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553
Orange lights flying in formation in the night sky over NYC;2017-10-07 21:50:00;2-3 minutes;Orange lights flying in formation in the night sky over NYC Driving NNW on Tompkins Avenue, towards Vanderbilt Ave., in Staten Island, NY (where I live), at about 21:50 (9:50 PM) on Sunday, October 8, 2017, I saw an array of maybe 8 to 10 orange lights, arranged roughly in the shape of a parallelogram, floating across the night sky.  The lights were larger than stars or the flashing lights on the wingtips of airliners, and they were moving along in formation.  I captured the phenomenon on my dashcam you can view the video here:   http://ammaze.net/video/orange-lights-in-night-sky.mp4   The map in the opening frame shows my location and direction.  The lights are first visible right after 21:50:55 -- keep your eyes trained on the sky above road.  You can see them floating left to right when I'm stopped for a red light.  They continue to be visible after the light turns green. My best guess is that these were photography drones see, e.g.,  http://www.zdnet.com/article/500-intel-drones-dance-in-the-night-sky/   Thank you.;40.6119682531091;-74.147436073553
