The sky was bright, mostly clear  with the sun rising and mostly wispy high clouds.  I spotted an odd, flat profile object moving right to left (West to East, roughly) straight across my windshield field of vision.  The object moved extremely slowly, even slower than the aircraft I see landing and taking off every day as I drive near Syracuse Hancock International Airport.  I also see Air Force drones flying all the time, as our base at Hancock Field trains Drone pilots for the Air Force. The object was white to a flat light gray, uniform in color.  It looked like a dime flat in profile, without striations on the edge.  I followed it with my eyes for approximately one minute, when it suddenly tipped to the right (South) and as it did I saw a very bright glint of silver as it tipped its bottom surface toward the rising sun.  It immediately accelerated up and to the Southwest at an approximately 45 degree angle.  For a second, I could see its disk shape as it angled away an then it was GONE.
