Cigar shaped light like a dull fluorescent bulb flying north of Syracuse, NY.;2021-05-16 00:03:00;5 minutes;Cigar shaped light like a dull fluorescent bulb flying north of Syracuse, NY. Shortly after midnight in Clay, NY (just south of Phoenix, NY), only a few minutes after the start of Sunday May 16, 2021, and about 5-10 minutes before the crescent moon set, I looked out an upstairs window to the north into a cloudless night sky to see the stars.  I saw the usual stars and planets and also an unusual light moving to the south.  The light was cigar shaped (rectangular) similar to a dull fluorescent bulb with a light blue tint. Its length was about the same as the diameter of a full moon, in the east-west direction, and its brightness was about ¼ of that of the moon.  After about a minute, I proceeded to wake my wife to show her the object.  Although difficult for me to determine, the elevation of the object appeared to be where most airplanes fly going to the Syracuse, NY airport (say 4,000 ft. +/-) and at a distance of several miles to the north over Oswego County. The light was moving to the south-southeast at what appeared to be the typical speed of an airplane.  After 3 or 4 minutes heading south, it started moving to the east for about a minute, with the light remaining in the same east-west orientation while fading from view, possibly because it moved far enough east to no longer reflect the moonlight back to us. We didn’t see any spotlights or blinking lights on the object like what would be seen on an airplane or one of the military drones that often fly out of the Syracuse airport.  We didn’t hear any noise from the object through the closed window nor after we opened the window as the object faded from view. I’m a retired 64 year old civil engineer and my wife is a 63 year old registered nurse, and we have never seen a flying light/object like this before.  We have lived in this same house for a little over 38 years.;43.1709999999997;-76.1742000000007
