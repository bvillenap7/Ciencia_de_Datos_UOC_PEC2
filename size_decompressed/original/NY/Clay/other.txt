Object traveled in a straight line at consistent speed and made no sound. Altitude was in the range of 300-500 feet.  It was a dark object on top and what looked like a flame a foot or two underneath.  As the object approached our limit to see it, the flame disappeared but the object continued in the same northerly direction.  Our best guess was it was a balloon or a lantern However, since it traveled a consistent speed at a different direction than the wind and continued its trajectory after the flame disappeared, I thought it warranted a report.  We did capture video of the object with a cell phone, but the quality is not great.;43.1709999999997;-76.1742000000007
