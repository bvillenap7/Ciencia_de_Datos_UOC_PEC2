UFO with colored moving lights and symbols on it;2013-01-15 02:20:00;20 minutes;UFO with colored moving lights and symbols on it While looking out with my binoculars, about 40-80 feet in the distance.  I saw a streak of white light go from a chimney into the air.  I assumed it was a tiny UFO. 50-100 feet in the distance, there was a large obelisk-looking UFO on the ground.  It was 8-12 feet tall, and it had lights on it.  Whatever it was, it had a black background the size of 3 feet wide by 12 feet tall, and there were colored lights that changed colors and moved around.   There were also lit up large symbols on the background of it I saw an orange symbol that looked sort of like a Chinese character on it.  Another symbol, at the bottom of the craft, looked like a blue bow with an arrow through it.   The UFO was also propped up somehow as there was about 5 feet length between the bottom symbol that I saw and the ground.   I had smoked a cigarette before this sighting.  I was on no other drugs at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.0353;-73.8514
