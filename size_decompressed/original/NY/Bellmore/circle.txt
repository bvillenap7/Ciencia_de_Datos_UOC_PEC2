Another one followed about 2 minuets later. This happened about 1 year ago. I was in my back yard there was a bright yellowish light flying in a stright line almost directly overhead across the sky from the North traveling South at very high speed, there was no sound. I did not see any structure to the object which suggests that it was pretty high up, it was just a bright yellow light. After that object passed by and disappeared in the horizon about 2 minuets later another one that looked exactly the same passed by following the same exact path as the first one and traveling at the same high speed. Again there was no sound which suggests that these were not just airplanes.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.6737;-73.5335999999999
