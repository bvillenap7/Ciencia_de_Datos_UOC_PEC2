silver disc seen by family and neighbors;1970-10-10 16:00:00;30 min.;silver disc seen by family and neighbors apx. 1970, i was the age of 9. one saturday afternoon, i was in the house reading the newspaper when my sister ran in the house and said if you want to see a ufo come quickly! there in the middle of the street were a few neighbors and family looking up at the sky and pointed it out to me. there in the low overcast clouds was a disk floating in the clouds. it was apx. 1500 feet above us and ever so slowly drifting north. it looked like your typical disc that you would see in the movies. it was just close enough to see windows on the ship. later at dinner, my dad came home and the discussion arose about the sighting.(a highly educated man, he holds 2 college degrees). he said it probably was a space sattilite. i asked him how far up are satilites. he said apx. 250 miles. i asked how far is 250 miles? he said from here to new jersey. i said well it couldnt be a satillite because i saw windows and i cant see 250 miles away. he slammed his knife on the dinner dish and said the discussion is over...we finished the meal in silence and i havent spoken about the sighting untill 30 years later when my sister sugested to put the sighting on this website.;40.6737;-73.5335999999999
