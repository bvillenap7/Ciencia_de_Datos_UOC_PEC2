I was sleeping on my 3rd floor apartment, the bed is just across the window. Curtains were full open. I woke up in the middle of the night, to see that the room is flooded with bright pink light.  I sat up in bed and could not believe what I was witnessing.  I never used drugs, I never had a hallucination in my life before.  I rubbed my eyes, but the strong pink light was still filling the room.  I kind of panicked and reached out to my lap top computer, which was on the floor next to my bed, I pressed a key to open the screen.  The moment my screen opened, the flash light filling the room turned off.  I looked out of the window, there was this strong ball of pink light right in front of my window.  I kept looking at it as it got smaller and the light faded away.  It seemed like this ball of light was moving slowly and horizontally, away from my window.;40.7915078947369;-73.7278203947368
