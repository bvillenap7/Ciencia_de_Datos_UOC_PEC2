The objects were flying at a very high altitude.  Higher than airplanes fly.  There were at least 3 of them, flying in single file, far apart from each other.  They were shaped like cigars, no wings or windows, and they were curved on the ends.  My neighbor was looking at them through his binoculars.  He let me look at them through his binoculars and the objects still looked very small, because they were so high up. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
