Silver metallic UFO the size of a football field appears over ridge in north eastern sky, comes directly over us about 2,000 ft up, no windows, no sound, moving very slowly,continued to watch it go south west until out of sight.  We all acknowledged what we saw to each other in total disbelief, and shock.   The next day I went to recount the incident with one of the co-workers, and they had totally wiped the sighting out of their mind, saying, What UFO?  It was validated in the daily Long Island newspaper NEWSDAY the following day with an article that said there were 50 thousand calls to 911 about this UFO sighting.  It has been almost 30 years, and I have never found the Newsday article nor have I read any other account of this documented mass sighting that I witnessed on this late summer afternoon.  If you did, please make a report. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.7644;-73.4471
