Orange Fireball flying E to W in a straight line at constant altitude.;2015-08-08 23:25:00;4 minutes;Orange Fireball flying East to West in a straight line at constant altitude August 8th, 2015, around 11:25 pm, in Old Bethpage, Long Island, I saw what appeared to be an orange fireball or jet aircraft on fire.  The fireball flickered like flames, but had no smoke or smoke trail.  I really thought it was an aircraft on fire, and was waiting to see if it plummeted to the ground, even though there were no strobe lights or navigational lights.  The fireball flew about the speed of a jet around 10000 feet high from the east to the west over several minutes in a clear evening sky, until it finally disappeared in the west behind a cloud.;40.7644;-73.4471
