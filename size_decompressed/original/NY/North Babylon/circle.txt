It was a bright orange color and had no other lights from the time I first saw it until the time it vanished it moved with in a 90 degree angle.  The wind at the time was 0-2 mph according to the national weather service blowing northeast.  The object vanished right as it seemed it was about to collide with another air craft seen in my video that had blinking lights you will notice it in my video.   Whatever it was, that I saw did not seem normal. http://youtu.be/FJv4EogavHY if you can clean the video up please do, it was shot on my iphone and doesn't do it justice to what I saw.;40.7257;-73.3287
