2 to 3 Orange fireballs randomly swerving in northeast, southern sky;2012-01-11 22:00:00;5 mins;2 to 3 Orange fireballs randomly swerving in northeast, southern sky Approximately three orange fireballs in southern sky. Moon was in east, objects were 45 degrees to south of moon. Orange balls appeared maybe 35 degrees above the horizon. They appeared to fly next to each other then one would pass the other at high speed and grace, their motion was like that of several spotlights such as would be seen in hollywood for example, but they were orange balls, like little suns. I ran to  get my husband to have him see and they dissapeared.  I am a local woman, I am in the accounting field, have workedfor non-profit orgs my entire career.  I have children, a husband, a house and a very busy life. I only saw these items in the sky because i was out back of my house having a ciggarette (a nightly ritual).  I am not a drug user.  I never in my life expected to see something like this.;44.9812;-74.6555
