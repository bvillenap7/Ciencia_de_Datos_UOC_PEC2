There was a pretty clear sky with a few clouds.  We shot off about 7 model rockets, C-class engines.  My little sister (11) then said she saw something.  When I looked I saw 3 white dots very far away in the sky.  We had seen planes flying over head before this.  The white dots seemed to go closer and further apart to each other the same way they did on 09/02/01.  Then they disapeared and we saw a red dot in the sky with our naked eyes.  Looking through the binoculers we saw that it was an oval, silverish, craft with a red center.  All together we saw 4 UFO's.  We shot off another model rocket in hopes to see more UFO's, but we didn't have any luck so we went home.;40.6564;-73.6754000000001

It moved too fast, and zigged and zagged.   Disappeared over the trees then saw it one more time and it was still?   Went straight up and disappeared.  This was no lantern. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I am sorry for that... The correct date was Monday evening   7/5/2010  at about 23:30 Thanks for asking again. ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));40.6564;-73.6754000000001
