We (father and 3 kids) went out for an hour to shoot off model rockets.  We shot about 10 rockets with class B engines.  After the 10th one, I (the father) witnessed what appeared to be the wadding out of one of the rockets.  But with a closer look, and the help of binoculars, they were nothing like anything we have ever seen before.  They were roundish with a red light,  but the red was not sharply defined.  Then my sons witnessed the light changed from one big light, to smaller lights.  There were many small ufo's and about 2 bigger ones.  They seemed to hover and then move quickly in different directions.  One even went in the opposite direction without slowing down and no circle.  Then after approximately 10 minutes, they started to dissappear.  We could not see exactly what it was, but in one occation, it appeared to get closer and was a shinny aluminum but quickly changed direction to be just out of range of getting a better look.;40.6564;-73.6754000000001
