As I was trying to fall asleep at approximately 10:45 pm, I noticed out of the window what seemed to be an orb of light passing across my window.  At a first glance, I could have mistaken it for an airplane, but it did not have small blinking lights and instead was one pea-sized bright white light.  It also had a quieter sound than an airplane, but a sound was still emitted.  As it passed across my window, I wondered if it was a headlight from a car or something of the sort,  but then I realized that my bedroom window does not face the street. I concluded that the object I saw was a UFO, and I came here for your help.;40.6564;-73.6754000000001
