A Small Lit up Craft @ 1130 Pm.;2005-07-27 23:30:00;20 Minutes;A Small Lit up Craft @ 1130 Pm. My friend and I walked out of his house @ about 1130 to go take out the trash. When we were at the end of his drive way, i noticed a strange light in the sky, to the west. It was wooded around his house with a few clearings. The light went behind some trees. Then it came out looped around and shot straight up in the air and dissapeared. After that we couldnt see it and we were looking for it. Then faceing south i noticed a small light moving directly upward very slowly. It was moving way to fast to be a star and too slow to be a plane. Also the craft made no sound. So when it got approximelty to our Zenith it shot left and turned into an oval shape. Then it went east and disssapeared. During the time we saw this, The wind stoped. We couldnt here any traffic ( and we were near a busy intersection traffic wise.) And most of all, Time seemed to stop. So we ran inside and got my friends mother. We waited aproxximetly 20 minutes before we came outside. When we did we looked around for about 5 minutes and saw notting, Until behind the trees, in one of the clearings a huge Oval light that almost looked like a fire ball apeared.IT was white, it was about the size of the moon. THen it seemed to have Exploded. Then the light got smaller. After that it went behind the trees to the north. Then we never saw it again. The whole time there was no sound. Everything seemed to stop. The airconditoner stoped working. and the phones did too.;40.8562;-73.3037000000001
3 oval ships flying together and break apart faster then sound.;2020-07-06 16:00:00;2 minutes;3 oval ships flying together and break apart faster then sound. I witnessed 3 reflective oval shapes that were flying in a triangle formation moving from north to south while slowly drifting in an easterly direction. The ships while keeping in formation zig zagged in all directions for about 20 seconds and then broke formation. 1 object travled west, one south and the third just disappeared. The speed they were traveling was much faster then any airplane I have seen in the sky so I would imagine they were flying at least 800 - 1000 MPH. There was no plane/vehicle/aircraft noise during the entire time other then the birds in the trees.;40.8562;-73.3037000000001
