Small round stationary object randomly winking light and fading away from clarity.;2016-06-18 19:45:00;7 minutes;Small round stationary object randomly winking light and fading away from clarity. One very small, white, stationary, round object.  Simalar to an iridium flare but not traveling in an orbital direction.  It moves in a twisting and flipping motion that caused it to either reflect the sun or disappear.  This lasted about seven minutes or less.   I opened the Night Sky app on my iPad that I asked my wife to get from inside, to see if there could be something in that part of the sky at this time.  I havent used this app much, so I don't know if it would show Iridium flares.  I have never seen a stationary one before.  There would be a star around that area but at this time it was too bright out to see any stars. (7:45 PM EST)  This was slightly south and east but mostly straight up in the sky.  I feel it was too high to be a drone.  If it was a balloon it should have drifted in the light northerly.  It dissapeared or I lost track of it after 7 minutes.   Mostly sunny sky.  I did see a plane fly by to the west, heading east, at a much lower altitude just before ! seeing the object.;40.8562;-73.3037000000001
