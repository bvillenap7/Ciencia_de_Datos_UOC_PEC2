It took a second or so to comprehend what I was looking at.   I pulled into mall on right hand side at the corner of Jericho and Elwood. I stopped in the middle of the parking lot.  The object was not a banner Being pulled by a plane.  It wasn't a balloon or anything else.  In my view was the smaller end of a rectangle  at a 3-7 degree Upwards slope and a 1-2 degree right pitch. Slope. It began moving away as I grabbed my iPhone. I was only able to catch 8-10 Frames of poor quality video which shows a an object as it disappears into a cloud. I estimate the size as two to three stories high and over 100 yards long.  The back end  was lined like the back end of a quarter.
