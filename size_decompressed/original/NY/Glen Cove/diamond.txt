BLUE DIAMOND SHAPED LIGHT, SUSPENDED IN THE SKY.;2005-02-17 23:20:00;20-25 minutes;BLUE DIAMOND SHAPED LIGHT, SUSPENDED IN THE SKY. It was a blue light suspended in the sky, i was looking at it through minaculers. The light was very distant but not too small, without minaculers it look very stady but once I looked at it through them the aircraft its light looked like it was moving around, I kept on trying to focus but it wouldn't look steady, other than if you look at it through the naked eye. I actually saw a plain fly right underneath it, the airplain look much smaller than the blue light the lights on the plain were flashing as it usually looks, and the blue light right above the plain was steady and much larger. I took some pics. looked away for a few seconds and before I knew it it was no longer there.;40.8627;-73.6351
