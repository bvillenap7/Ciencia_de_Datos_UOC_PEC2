White slow flashing light;2008-04-08 22:45:00;20 seconds;White slow flashing light I was in my backyard, stargazing, when I saw a white light flash, then 3 seconds later, it flashed again. The light flashed 3 times with 3 seconds separting each flash, and then it stopped.  There was no sound, and no other lights.  It was extremely high up in the sky.  The only thing visible, was the flashing light.  There were no clouds and no jet in the vicinity.  I look at the sky nearly every night, and have never seen anything like this before.;40.8627;-73.6351
