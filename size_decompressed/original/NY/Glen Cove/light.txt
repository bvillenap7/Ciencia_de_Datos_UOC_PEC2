I thought it was a plane but there was no noise, no blinking lights of any kind and it was very bright, mabey five to ten thousand feet in the air. it was large. I called my son out to the front yard to see it. Although it hadn't travelled far it started to dim quickly. He came out, looked, i said its dimming, he said no there it is and pointed, but pointed above where my craft was. my craft disappeared and i saw what he saw. A faint light, like a star, fall slowly to approxamatley where my craft disappeared. It was amazing and i hope someone else saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  If the object was traveling from northwest to southeast, it was not the International Space Station, which passed overhead Glen Clove at 19:55 hrs. on this date.  It may have been another satellite, but satellites do not turn.  PD));40.8627;-73.6351
