This light revolved around in a circle patten underneath the large craft. it revolved around 5 or 6 times then left in a southern pattern toward buffalo airport. It moved slow then as if it knew we where looking it took off rapidly.the large craft seem to make a turn without leaning like a plane and took off. I waited to tell anyone because im still in disbelief myself. I just cant sleep and needed to tell someone. I have nothing to gain just piece of mind my 8 yr old son mention it to me just the other day so I know he feels like me as does my wife. I always wanted to see if these things where real now i wish i was still wondering ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.9051;-78.7059000000003
