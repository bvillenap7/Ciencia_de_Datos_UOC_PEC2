((HOAX??))  Small lights at high altitude wobbling across the sky.;2014-06-15 20:30:00;15 minutes;Small lights at high altitude wobbling across the sky. The 4 of us were hanging out at my dads and we noticed how clear the sky was.  We saw some planes and such but then noticed very small looking lights (they looked pretty high) cruising across the sky.  A little faster than youd see an airliner go over but these looked much higher.   The weird part that made us think that they were not planes was that they seemed to wobble or swerve back and forth.  We all noticed it fairly quick.  The first one went across and disappeared and then another came over and did the same in a perpendicular direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax, we suspect.  We cannot find a Boston, NY, and the date supplied by the witness is flawed.  We have amended the date above.  PD));42.6274;-78.7377
