Bright light traveled quickly across sky.;2013-09-05 22:20:00;2 seconds;Bright light traveled quickly across sky. I am located 25 miles south of Buffalo New York in Boston Valley, which is a partial rural environment.   Tonight, September 5, 2013 at approximately 10:20 PM EST, I was outside admiring the night sky when a bright object flew west to east at great speed.  The object was low on the horizon.  I was unable to see where it continued to due to hills being in the way.  There was no sound and the event lasted maybe 2 seconds.  It did not appear like a meteor the brightness remained constant, and was colored a hint of yellow /gold.  There were no wires or lines in that direction or height.;42.6274;-78.7377
