I have been seeing the same craft for over a month now and it flashes red,white,and green.it moves in a circular mostion and very slitly ,and about 3 weeks ago i saw 5 of them flying in a formation that made a huge triangle that looked to be ove a few miles wide and i thought i was crazy. but i dont think i am but i dont have a camcorder to video it ... but i c them almost every nite. have not seen them in formation but only the one time...;42.6274;-78.7377
