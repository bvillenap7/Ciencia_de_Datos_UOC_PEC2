In the western sky.  I noticed it was making various movement sideways & up & down.  I don't know how long it was there before I first saw it.  I recorded it on my phone for 42 seconds then stopped.   In the next 20 seconds the front on right turned brilliant red then shot off in the south-western Sky;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
