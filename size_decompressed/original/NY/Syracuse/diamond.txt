Bright orange object, 5-10 arcmin, indistinct borders, S. to N., 4 min horizon to horizon.;2014-08-29 23:50:00;3-4 minutes;Bright orange object, 5-10 arc-minutes, indistinct borders, S. to N., 4 min horizon to horizon, Star gazing with new refractor about MN, (note often see satellites passing S. to N. overhead, meteors, airplanes, and I know the difference), naked eye observation of very bright glowing orange object pass in strait line S. to N..   Unusual in that there was a very bright glow or cloud that was large surrounding it, not pin-point as in a satellite or plane but in angular degree probable about the size of my little finger nail or less held at arm stretch.   Shape seemed somewhat triangular but cloud like.    45 min later passes over again same speed and direction but brighter.    Assume dying orbit of satellite entering upper atmosphere?  In 45 years of star gazing never saw anything like it.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
