What is hovering over lyncourt/eastwood/syracuse??????????????;2012-03-12 22:04:00;5 minutes;What is hovering over lyncourt/eastwood/syracuse?????????????? This is the second thime i saw this object whithin a month on a cloudy night.  I left my house and drove down court st toward the eastwood section of syracuse when i instantly saw this rectangle looking thing in the sky hovering low in and out of the clouds over eastwood-lyncourt area of syracuse,ny.  It had white and red circle lights on it from left to right and the red lights look l.e.d-ish. not bright but not dim and the white lights looked a little blue.   the airport is nearby and i ruled out any airplanes or helicopters because there was an airplane getting ready to land and that didnt look like any helicopter.  There were about ten cars on the road around me.  it didnt make any noise and i heard that they were testing drones at the airport but that wasn't any drone and why would a drone be out when passenger planes are trying to land?/! I saw the same thing earlier this month in the same spot around the same time.  I tried to call my girlfriend but th! e phine didnt have any signal until i didn't see it anymore and then the call went through.  I am a very skeptical person but this is something i can't explain and i cant find anything on the net about it but i did find a video of what im talking about on youtube...ufo over syracuse is the nave of the video and it sure looks exactly like what i saw.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821

I thought it was a helicopter but it did not move at all and was composed of numerous lights of a bright and prismatic quality unlike a helicopter, it gradually blinked out slowly each a longer time until it just dissipated in the same stationary position.   I do not know what this was and it did not resemble any known craft or natural object I had ever seen.  It did not move and it was blinking fairly brightly and then it winked out.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821

5 Orange Starburst Shaped Lights,steady illuminance, no shape change,moving in a direct vertical direction and then horizontal;2016-09-07 20:00:00;4-5 minutes;5 Orange Starburst Shaped Lights,steady illuminance, no shape change,moving in a direct vertical direction and then horizontal My husband and I were outside.  He was sitting facing me.  All of a sudden I saw three bright orange star shapes in the sky.  I said to my husband GET UP LOOK AT THIS! -  We continued to watch the lights, one moved up and then they moved towards our house and disappeared.  They did not flicker like Airplanes and Satellites do , but stayed a bright orange.  A few minutes later there were 2 more, they went in the same direction as the first 3.  There was no noise, no change in shape.  Very, very odd. We always have planes flying into Hancock Airport and Helicopters flying over.  They have a specific direction and we can ALWAYS here them. These starbursts were silent and moved in a straight vertical direction before going over our house and into the clouds -  Or wherever when they dissappeared.

I was on my phone in my bad and something caught my attention in my peripheral vision and I sit up and there is a light flashing and I look a little closer and notice almost a circle shape but not just one 3 combined and it was gliding away with a very powerful light and I do not know what it was but I do know it was not a aircraft I've seen or heard of it managed to capture a zoomed in video after I managed to snap out of my nervous shocked faze.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821

There was no explosive sound of any kind.  But two brief and very faint electrical surge sounds as the incident occurred.  I then noticed a few small pinpoints of light moving through the clouds at my 10 o'clock.  It was making me a bit nervous.  I began to notice more floating at my 12 o'clock.  I stood still and observed the lights float overhead.  One moved erratically for a few seconds like a fruit fly and then resumed its path.  There turned out to be to many to try and count.  They were all even in size and somewhat amber in color.  They did not twinkle. It was very unsettling.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
