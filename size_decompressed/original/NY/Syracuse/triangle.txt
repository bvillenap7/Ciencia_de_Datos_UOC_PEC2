Black triangles in the sky with Hale Bopp.;1997-05-25 22:00:00;20;Black triangles in the sky with Hale Bopp. We saw these craft when Hall Bopp was coming by. I had my telescope out looking and we saw this triagular (long wings short body) it was hovering, it almost seemed like they were either looking at us or Hale Bopp. I turned around and looked up and their was another one only higher. I have to tell you I went in the house and got my 35mm and got a picture(misplaced at this moment)but we had this real strong earge to go inside...even though is was a warm evening maybe using em weapons?? I don't know. I know this is just one more of many as I recall the phoenix lights were as the same time.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
I was on I-90 30, miles west of Syracuse, NY when I saw a very big bright light in the distance. As I got closer to it over the course ;2000-09-07 20:30:00;5 mins;I was on I-90 30, miles west of Syracuse, NY when I saw a very big bright light in the distance. As I got closer to it over the course of the next few minutes I saw it was a very large triangular object, moving very slowly East Northeast....the front light was white and very bright the rear two points of the triangle were not as bright and were blinking on and off in unison, very slowly. The lights formed a perfect triangle and were about 1,000 feet over the ground. I then saw another object, exactly the same as the first traveling the same direction about a mile or two behind the first. I did everything I could to tell myself it was just a couple of aircraft in formation but after watching these objects for SO long (5 mins or more) I was sure it was not aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke on the telephone with this witness and found him to be seemingly quite credible in his report.  The objects seemed to be moving, since they moved from the south side of the highway to the north during the time that the witness has them in sight.  PD));43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821

three bright lights sighting;2002-08-14 21:00:00;one minute;three bright lights sighting I was driving on top of a hill 5 miles south of Syracuse, NY.  I saw a very bright white light, very low to the ground - just above tree level.  I thought that it was a helicopter or something, so I slowed way down and kept looking at it.  It had two less brighter lights on the back.  I could not see any body form, just the very bright light up front and the two behind.  It was not moving and I did not notice any sound.  then, right before my eyes - I did not look away, I did not blink, it disappeared.  It just vanished and I could see a much lighter night sky again.  I mentioned this to a friend of mine that is a clan mother for the Onondaga Indians (Iroquois) and she said that there have been many sightings around the reservation and that her people have invited them to speak with their counsel of chiefs.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821

I kept watching it and  saw it was not flying it was hovering over a field and as truck went by it it appeared to be triangular in shape with a flashing white light on it's rear and a steady green light in front of the white flashing one. In front was a large light array which dimmed to a dull reddish glow by the time the truck went by. It made no noise that I could hear and was just sitting in the air over this field. It was very dark that morning but it looked like a triangle shape against the clouds. We drove past it with no other incident.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
