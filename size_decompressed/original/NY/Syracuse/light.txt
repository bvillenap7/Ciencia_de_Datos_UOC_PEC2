unidentified light source seen moving in rapid zig-zag motions across clear night sky;2004-11-03 21:00:00;approx. 1 minute;unidentified light source seen moving in rapid zig-zag motions across clear night sky Between 9-10 pm on 11/3/04 on a cloudless night, I happened to glance out my kitchen window facing north to look at what I thought might be planets but were probaly just bright stars.  I then noticed a third light source which at first I thought to be just a normal airplane moving directly away from me as it did not seem to be moving much. After a few seconds of watching this light source, it began to move in what I can only describe as erratic zig zag motions, ie. up, down, left and right at varying angles.  It appeared to be covering large distances very quickly as it did this.  This went on for at least 30 to 60 seconds before it left my field of view.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821

watched an unusual light in the sky for an hour on a starless night. moved slowly.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus?  PD));2007-05-04 22:30:00;About 1 hour;watched an unusual light in the sky for an hour on a starless night. moved slowly, changing colors at times, eventually disappears... My boyfriend and I were on his bed watching TV. From the corner of my eye I noticed an unusually bright star, then I noticed that there were no other stars in the sky. We watched the light for about 10 minutes when we noticed that it was getting smaller and dimmer. Planes were flying by the object, and it was obvious that no plane could have hovered like that. It was moving but too slowly for the object to have been man-made, seeming to defy the laws of gravity. Occationally the light appeared to change colors, but mainly it was a bright white light. We watched the object for a good hour before it got smaller and smaller, and eventually disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

I saw a very bright light in the sky that passed and then shot off into space.;2008-05-20 23:35:00;90 Seconds;I saw a very bright light in the sky that passed and then shot off into space. I was outside on my front porch, just smoking a cigarette.  I'm one to gaze at the stars and simply enjoy the night sky.  I sat looking at the stars and then it seemed as though one was moving kind of slowly across the sky.  This did not look like a plane because it almost looked like a bright star was moving slowly across the sky.  Then all of a sudden it seemed to turn torward me, and the only reason I say this 'light' 'turned' is because the light became a lot brighter and it looked almost like a huge spotlight was being turned rather quickly to an observer(me)...but the light not not shine far out.  It was just a very bright light that 'turned' in a sense and sat for about 5 seconds and suddenly the object began to appear dimmer and dimmer.  It seemed like although the object was flying into space at a very rapid speed.  It simmed very quickly and soon the object was not visible, AT ALL.  The was no doubt a UFO front my perspective.  I watched it fly into space and away from the earth!  I could not believe this.  I would like to gain more information on what I saw and if there were any other witnesses in this area.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821

extremely bright light moving back&forth southwestern sky Syracuse,NY disappeared upward;2009-02-09 06:20:00;15-20 min;extremely bright light moving back&forth southwestern sky Syracuse,NY disappeared upward At approx. 06:20 on 02/09/09 I looked out a skylight window in my bedroom and noticed an unusually bright light in the sky.  Not having my glasses on at the time, my first thought was that the moon was still out and was really bright.  I put my glasses on and immediately recognized that it was not the moon, but very similar to a very bright star exceptionally far away.  I then just layed there observing this star.  Upon observation of approx. a few minutes, it appeared that this star was in fact moving in a back and forth movement, to the right and then left.  Being that I observed this through a rectangular skylight, I did have borders from which I could tell that this object was in fact moving.  At that point I called to my wife and asked her to look at this.  As she looked at it, I asked her if she could see it moving.  She said that she could, and at that I said I thought it was a UFO.  She responded coming to get you?  She then went back to getting ready for work and I continued to watch, even having to reposition myself as this object had gotten to far to the right border of the skylight.  After a few moments passed, I then noticed this light start to diminish.  I assumed cloud coverage as it seemed to come in and out of light.  It then disappeared.  To me it appeared that this object went up as opposed to going any other direction.  I continued to watch for approx. 15 minutes longer to make sure that cloud coverage wasn't hiding this light.  My honest opinion is that this light was far to high in the sky to be a helicopter.  I thought of trying to contact the Onondaga Co. Sheriffs' Dept. to inquire if they in fact had their chopper in what would have been the southwestern sky, but I didn't want to lose sight of it by going to the phone.  Also, I took note that there was not on other star in the sky.  I am sending this message out in the hopes that maybe someone could look into this, or that maybe another report was made about the same thing.

Strange light/aircraft moved over Eastwood/Sedwick Farms. Did anyone else see this?;2012-03-15 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;Strange light/aircraft moved over Eastwood/Sedwick Farms. Did anyone else see this? I had just gone outside with my dog before bed, and noticed a strange golden light in the sky.  It appeared to be flying lower than an airplane or a helicopter, and was moving very slowly.  It seemed to come from the direction of Eastwood and was moving through Sedwick Farms.  At first, I did not hear any noise at all, but there was a significant breeze.  Then, as it approached my house through the trees, i could hear it.  It made a very quiet roar, much softer than that of an airplane.  The light it was emitting was so bright, that I could not distinguish if it was one light or several clumped together.  It passed over, and everything is quiet again.  I am a scientist and a skeptic, and I have never seen anything like this.  I would be lying if I said that I wasn't a bit shaken up at the moment.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
Went to move my car to the other side of the road in the city of syracuse.  saw low flying lights moving east towards dowtown.;2012-10-10 19:40:00;15 minutes;went to move my car to the other side of the road in the city of syracuse.  saw low flying lights moving east towards dowtown.  the lights were small, orange, and were flashing.  they seemed like they might have been diamond shaped but was hard to tell due to the small size.  they were low flying and moved in 100% silence, absolutely no noise.  there were about 20 and did not seem to be proceeding in any type of formation.  i watched them move eastward until they were out of site.  brought my mother out as well (home on break from school) and she also had no idea what they were.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
Meandering bright light in sky desends and seems to land.;2013-03-09 19:00:00;5 minutes;Meandering bright light in sky desends and seems to land. I live on the north side of the city near the Mall.  Around the time mentioned I stepped out of my front door to get some air and the sky was clear and I I had a good view of the south an western area of it when I observed a rather bright red-orange light somewhat like a diamond shape but unable to be sure of its exact shape hovering in the south and coming closer to my location.  I first thought it was a plane or helicopter that police use but it had no  anti collision lights on it as per FAA regs and the whole thing seemed lit with up a strange light unlike a chopper.  It hovered in the area then veered west slightly and desended fairly fast almost looking like it landed not far away.  I was tempted to go and check it out but was too tired and it was too cold. It may just have been a kids toy remote controlled helicopter with a light on it but the light seemed rather bright for a toy. I guess its just Unidentified.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821

It looked like it was pulsating but not moving.  I didn't  take my eyes off it for about 15 min.  I looked away for a sec and it was gone.  I think I spotted it going west.

VERY bright moving light that lasted a long time - Chinese space station?;2018-03-24 20:00:00;40 seconds;VERY bright moving light that lasted a long time - Chinese space station? I was looking at what I believed was a very bright planet, when I realized it was moving across the sky to the WNW.  It was moving slowly and was about as bright as the brightest planet I’ve seen.  I’m used to seeing all kinds of aircraft and have lived near airports and army bases most of my life.  This thing eventually left a pinprick of a red spot but faded out before it had gotten far enough away TO fade out.  I knew it wasn’t an airplane or a helicopter.  I can only assume it was something to do with that Chinese spacecraft coming back into the atmosphere.  This thing seemed to follow the curve of the earth.  I am in a suburb with some light pollution, but it is VERY clear tonight, with the waxing moon fully visible.  I am an amateur sky watcher and took basic astronomy in college. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness seems to suggest that the object was traveling in a WNW direction.  Satellites rarely travel to the west in a retrograde orbit.  PD));43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
