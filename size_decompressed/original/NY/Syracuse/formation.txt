High altitude V-formation of 7 objects;1995-06-03 13:00:00;15-20 seconds;High altitude V-formation of 7 objects High Altitude Formation  Description  On a CAVU day while driving north on I-81 about 100 miles south of Syracuse, New York at around 1 PM on June 3, 1995, I saw a low-flying small aircraft pass directly over and perpendicular to the Interstate about a half-mile ahead, then disappear over a row of trees to my right. I deduced that an airport must be nearby and began scanning the sky for other aircraft. Not noticing anything, my scan gradually rose in altitude until I noticed a V-formation of white dots flying from west to north-east. I counted seven individual dots, one on point and three on each leg. They were moving rapidly, left no contrails, and appeared to be at extremely high-altitude. They had no discernible form, appearing as small white dots-not shiny but soft white. I watched them move at a constant speed for approximately 15 to 20 seconds as they traversed 45 degrees of azimuth. At that point they appeared to slow almost imperceptibly and then vanished. Analysis:  Although this event occurred almost 13 years earlier, it is quite accurate. I had written down the particulars shortly after it happened, and my present memory of the event corresponds exactly to that written record. I have also confirmed the exact date, although the time of day is approximate. It is impossible to tell at what altitude these objects were flying. However, I expect that they were at extremely high altitude because they had no discernible form. Commercial aircraft flying at FL330 have a clearly visible aircraft shape, but these objects were merely dots. They were clearly not birds, which display a typical individual motion as they flap their wings. These objects never varied in size, color, intensity or motion. It is quite apparent that just before they vanished from view they began a turn, giving the perception of slowing. As the turn progressed, they no longer reflected sunlight toward me and became invisible. The angle of azimuth covered by the flight of the objects is known because they came into my view just beyond the left corner of the windshield and they disappeared almost directly ahead. Furthermore, this section of the Interstate was as straight as an arrow, for you could see the road stretch out for miles ahead with no curves whatsoever. The duration of observation is approximate I did not record the exact times. Estimating duration of time for short-lived events is notoriously inaccurate, unless there is some reference. Because I am cognizant of this fact, I have tried to mentally relive the event and time its duration. While observing the objects I kept pointing them out to my passenger, who never did see them. I have taken that dialog into account and added additional precious seconds to arrive at what I believe is a fairly close and extremely conservative approximation. Given these variables, it can be estimated that at 30,000 feet the speed of the formation would be between approximately 780 and 1045 MPH, and at 50,000 feet the speed would range from approximately 1295 to 1725 MPH.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
cluster of lights (with a few steaming out) flashing in serial order from red to green stayed in same spot, but appeared to be moving;2003-10-04 23:45:00;still going;cluster of lights (with a few steaming out) flashing in serial order from red to green stayed in same spot, but appeared to be moving We were looking at constellations when we spotted an unusually close knit cluster of stars. Upon further observation it became apparent to us that they were not stars because they were smaller than all the other stars and they were flashing in a serial pattern (one after another in order) from green to red color. The flashing made the object appear to be spinning perhaps, or atleast moving slightly, but as we watched (and as we checked on it throughout the night) it continued to be present and obviously out of place. As we are star lovers and fond of viewing constellations we knew that it was not something normally visable in the night sky. It didn't move rapidly or look like a plane and our only other thought was that it was a space station, but we felt oddly uncomfortably certain that it was simply a U.F.O. Upon our first spotting of the craft our eyes watered... but that could be merely coincidental however it was heavy tearing.  The object wasn't bright enough to take a picture of and was barey visable in well-lit areas. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have observed a twinkling star.  Just a guess.

Two points of light in formation glide across the sky.;2004-11-03 22:30:00;5 seconds;Two points of light in formation glide across the sky. Looking east out my 12th story apartment window, which was open, I noticed with surprise that the constellations Orion and Ursa Major were visible, just above the horizon -- surprise because I live in a medium-sized city with a fair amount of light pollution.  The sky, then, was unusually clear (meaning that any stars were visible at all I certainly couldn't see anything in the sky dimmer than major stars, e.g. satellites).  I noticed a hovering red light in the distance -- a helicopter, maybe a plane.  Then, two points of light entered my field of view almost directly overhead, travelling from west to east.  My first thought was military aircraft, because the points, which were yellow, were travelling in tandem with a constant distance between them.  Then the points of light veered away from each other somewhat before coming back together, essentially flying two gentle arcs before returning to their previous arrangement.  I realized, as the lights vanished (not exactly over the horizon, but out of view), that they were travelling far faster than aircraft.  That's it.  I'm writing this because the lights seemed unusual I'm certainly not conviced I saw UFOs.  But I've seen plenty of shooting stars, airplanes, and satellites, and these weren't that.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821

The motorist spotted three as they slowly dropped down on the horizon.  Then they were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

A mass, grey oddly circular shaped, came twisting out of the clouds for about 5-10 seconds and then receded.;2015-09-28 18:10:00;5-10 seconds;A mass, grey oddly circular shaped, came twisting out of the clouds for about 5-10 seconds and then receded. My wife and I were driving to Syracuse, NY, and were approximately 9 miles from the Watertown exit on US 81. Time was 6:09 pm on Sept. 28. The sky was overcast, with a little sunlight still out. The event was about 5-10 seconds, but it is the most vividly amazing thing I have ever seen. I mass of grey, that seemed circular in shape with irregular edges, literally came out of the clouds.  It seemed unstable or experiencing “turbulence” and was making an almost twisting motion.  The surface texture seemed rough, not smooth, and the craft was obviously experiencing some sore of turbulence.  I took it at first to be some sort of meteor or rock type of thing.  It was almost unreal, honestly.  After taking notice, I alerted my wife and she too witnessed the perceivably large unidentified object twist through the air.  The craft then receded to the clouds, of which we could still see the shadow of faintly.  It then was gone. There were no lights, and the craft of whatever kind had to be huge to be literally inside the clouds. It almost seemed like something out of a movie…I have always been extremely skeptical of these sorts of things.  Yet, this thing was definitely SOMETHING and I have no idea how to explain it.  Not a weather balloon, much to large.  Definitely not a plane, there were no indications of shape or size of the sort.  It was not hurling to the ground, so it wasn’t a meteor or anything of the type and there was no tail.  The way it regained control of itself and receded back in to the clouds and the event of this object moving in the way it did were perhaps the most interesting and odd aspects.  I really don't know what to make of it and my wife doesn't either.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
Two flashing lights move together same direction and speed and then vanish;2016-05-17 21:10:00;<1 minute;Two flashing lights move together same direction and speed and then vanish I wanted to report a possible UFO sighting.  I had seen an exact same sighting just a few years ago.  This one has the exact same flashing, floating, vanishing lights.  The following is what happened tonight at about 9:10 p.m. May 17, 2016. I heard a bunch of sirens outside my apartment, so I looked out to see what was going on and what direction they were going in.  I live in a pretty big city and a bad section where there’s always something going on.  I thought I had heard a car chase so that was what had me curious.  It was twilight and the sky was that beautiful mix of colors -of dark blue, light blue, green, yellow, and  then pink and red.  I saw two lights in the far distance rising up into the sky.  I could tell immediately that they were odd by the way they were moving and the way they looked.  They were floating at two different spots.  Blinking on and off.  Red all the time and the white was flashing.  I could tell they were on the horizon but not as far away as stars would be.  They were not planes.  They made no noise.  They flashed on and off, moving at the exact same speed and in the same direction as the other.  Then they simply faded, disappeared, vanished before my eyes.  Just like the ones in 2013.  I could not tell the shape.  All I saw was two lights moving and flashing at the same speed, vanished at the same time.  (I think it was 2013 when I went to Westcott Beach/Henderson Harbor/Sackett’s Harbor in New York State.  We were camping and I saw a whole bunch of them floating across the sky.  They vanished before my eyes.)  It gave me a chilly, startling feeling.  I see airplanes all the time since I live in a highrise and there’s an airport across the city.  These were NO airplanes.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
