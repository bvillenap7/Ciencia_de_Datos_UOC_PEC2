Fire ball spotted while on highway;2002-03-09 03:25:00;5 minutes;Fire ball spotted while on highway Me and my friends were driving home from Snow Ridge and we were getting on the highway just outside Syracuse.  We were in the back of my friends truck when this ball of glowing red appeared about 200 meters in front of us.  We started to slow down to get a better look as we came just under the ball we quickly realized that it was only a about a hundred feet in the air.  The craft then split into two parts.  As we drove under the craft its stayed right above us as if it was following us.  My friend took one of the high beam spot lights and flashed at it a few times.  The craft got brighter and scared us all.  Just then it took off very fast.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821

10 floating fireball looking lights flying over parking lot of store in syracuse,ny.;2012-08-26 21:00:00;5 minutes;10 floating fireball looking lights flying over parking lot of store in syracuse,ny. There was 10 red lights floating above  The wegmans grocery store.  They all were flying at the same speed quite close to eachother & made no noise at all!!  They were very much synchronized & pretty close, close enough for me to catch a picture on my cell phone.  There hard to describe but they didn't really look like an object or it was to dark to tell what they were.  The best description I could use is floating fireballs.  After about 5-7 minutes they disappeared into the sky!  It was the bizarre & amazing thing I have ever seen!!!!!;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
Orange Orbs... at least 30 spotted over 2 plus hours during fireworks display.;2015-07-04 21:30:00;2 hours +;Orange Orbs... at least 30 spotted over 2 plus hours during fireworks display. My family and I went out tonight to see the fireworks here in Syracuse, NY... I think it was around [b]9:15-9:30[/b] PM EST. We weren't there 3 minutes when my wife pointed something out to me and then I saw them over and over and over again. Orange orbs. As everyone else was fixated on the massive fireworks display that seemed to engulf the entire city, I was looking out for these mysterious orange lights. I kept seeing them and pointing them out to my daughter. They were moving southeast but they seemed to be moving up as well, as they would disappear from sight. But they kept coming... It was getting a little creepy. One of the orange orbs we were watching sped across the sky at a much faster rate than the others!  As the fireworks died down, we were trying to determine if we would go home or try to seek out more of these strange lights.  Well we didn't have to think too long about that as we kept seeing them all around and so we drove throughout the city trying to get close to them. We saw two that looked like they would pass right over us and so we pulled over and that's where I got this one picture with my daughters phone as my battery was about to run out. We kept driving around the city and kept seeing them... one off in the distance here... one there... two over here... And then we all saw a beautiful cluster of four!  I jumped out of the car to try and get a picture of the grouping but the phone wouldn't focus on them and I didn't get that picture.  :(   I have no idea what these were or if I'll see them again. For a moment, as I was trying to come to some rational explanation, I thought of space debris burning up in the atmosphere as it crossed.  These never 'fizzled' out though and they seemed to have a distinct pulsation to them. In all... on this 4th of July, I believe we counted at least 30 of these things. It was weird but very cool!;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821

Shooting star (Meteor), and what looked like a red fireball, and made no sound.;2019-07-10 10:10:00;3 minutes;Shooting star (Meteor), and what looked like a red fireball, and made no sound.  I was sitting on the porch smoking a cigarette, when I noticed a shooting star made a wish. Then through the trees a red light was flying kind of slow,  I thought it was a plane at first cause it looked like a red light blinking,but it wasn't.  It was a floating fireball moving through the sky.  I opened up the door and yelled to my mother to look at this UFO.  I turned back around and it was gone.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
Steady stream of red, slow moving lights in the sky.  ((anonymous report));2019-08-05 21:25:00;00:15;Steady stream of red, slow moving lights in the sky. My husband and I were watching baseball and saw lights moving in the sky outside the window. They were slow-moving, red, fireball looking lights, traveling in pairs and moving slowly without sound.  More kept appearing.   Our neighbor came outside and observed them as well.   This continued for about 15 minutes.  I have never seen anything quite like this in the night sky before - larger than stars and noiseless.  Very strange.
