no noise, no dirt stirred up, two identical crafts never seen before, the ability to hover without making a sound;1976-06-01 08:30:00;30 minutes;no noise, no dirt stirred up, two identical crafts never seen before, the ability to hover without making a sound I have a blog that tells of the experience http://((blog address deleted)).blogspot.com/   The craft was round in shapr and had 3 large oval lights in a tight configuration to the front of the craft and these lights blinked in succession  of red, white, green. It was complertely silent and rose no dust or dirt while hovering in our backyard. We took a picture of it because it would float by each night at the same time -when I took the picture and the flash went off -four large red lights flashed on at the bottom of the craft blinking in this order first, third, second, fourth  The object was quite large and as it went over our building I noticed that the bottom of the ship was a huge conglomeration of microchip configurations-there was no empty space except the space occupied by the lights. It appeared to have a mesh or screen like covering over the bottom-this had to have some sort of feet to land, there is no other way.

5 oval lights on craft (red, white, green) underneath lights 4 round red lights-seen when the sky was dark and clear Syracuse, New York;1987-06-01 19:00:00;10 min;5 oval lights on craft (red, white, green) underneath lights 4 round red lights-seen when the sky was dark and clear Syracuse, New York I was coming back from the store and noticed lights in the backyard they were large oval shaped lights 3 of them and they were red, white and green and blinked in succession.  I went up to the craft which hovered over my head but made no sound and no dust or dirt was stirred up.  It Hovered wavering from side to side It stayed there for a while then turned in the direction of an identical craft traveling pretty fast then followed it and left.  The following nights the same crafts were seen In the yard traveling the length of the building my son said to take a picture of it so I did.  When the flash went off 4 red lights flashed on at the bottom and the craft was quite large-instead of going away from us it came toward us and I shot many pictures of the underneath side of the craft the red lights blinked in a succession of first , third, second, forth. The underneath was like a large configuration of computer chips with no empty space except for the lights, the bottom was covered by a screening.  I could see these things in the sky because the oval lights would make you thin they were twinkling stars at a distance.  I was also told by these beings not to reach out as it would be taken as a sign of aggression I have listed some things that happened after the original sighting on a small blog.  http://((address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

1 bright oval shape and 2 acorn orange fireballs;2015-07-04 19:15:00;35 minutes;1 bright oval shape and 2 acorn orange fireballs My husband, daughter and I were on our way home from a cook out driving down Wolf St. When we noticed the fireworks show and decided to pull on the side curb to view the display.  Upon seeing the display my attention kept focusing on the orb in the sky.  It was just hovering so I thought it couldn't be a plane.  May-be a helicopter?  Can a helicopter fly that high?  Wait a minute this thing is a oval shape glowing.  Now I'm still in the car with my 2 year old grandson but at this time my husband and daughter were already out enjoying the festivities so I thought.   My daughter (21 yrs) knocked on the window and said mom Do u see what I see?  I rolled down my window and said (I thought I was the only one.  Record it and see what happens.)  So she recorded this thing hovering,flying left to right, changing bright colors and eventually dropping out of site behind the trees.  Then we left after that not caring about the firework display.  Still questioning what we saw.   Then I look up above our car their were 2 acorn fireballs in the sky.  They were flying at a perfect distance apart from each other bright orange. I tried to get my husband to pull over but he refuse.  When we pulled up in front of our house the fireballs remained across in the distance.  We stood out side no longer having doubts what we were witnessing.  The fireball on the left flew to the left and disappeared within seconds.  The one on the right remained about 30 seconds and appeared to follow the other fireball repeating the same path.  We came in the house in a amazement.  My daughter went to lay her son down for bed and I heard her say MOM.  By the time I got to the window they disappeared again.She saw 3 more fireballs in a triangle shape formation.  Seriously!!!  I may of had doubts in the past but as crazy and maybe even insane as this may sound I am now a believer.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
Craft spotted during fireworks show.;2015-07-04 21:00:00;20 minutes;Craft spotted during fireworks show. During the fireworks display at the basball stadium on July 4th, I noticed something strange hovering in the sky.  It took me a moment to realize it was not of human origin.  It changed colors every few minutes, as if just fading from blue to pink to purple to orange.   It moved in a way I've never witnessed before.  The way it bolted horizontally super fast and stopped instantly.  Or the way it moved completely vertical with ease.  It was as if the craft were watching the fireworks show.   It was there for quite some time.  And when the show finished.  It simply lowered vertically super fast.  And then it was gone.

UFO hovered and maneuvered over the highway ahead of us.  my car shut off and electrical, too.;2016-12-15 21:00:00;5 minutes;was driving up the highway. today 12/15/2016 we got hit with a small strong snow storm and there was not a lot of traffic on the highway but me and a few cars.  a UFO hovered and maneuvered over the highway ahead of us.  my car shut off and electrical too and the other cars around me. the ufo stood like 200 meters in front of us and it vanished completely.   I tried to turn my car on and it did not want to turn on.  I had to call triple A to jump my car. thanks to god it did turn on and the other drivers and me we were speechless and shocked.  I am a veteran and this is not the first time I encounter these events or seen ufos. what makes it interesting its that right before it happen a loud air force jet flew around the vicinity.  then that occurred. ((NUFORC Note:  We attempted to contact the source of the report via telephone, but were unable to reach the party, or leave a message.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
