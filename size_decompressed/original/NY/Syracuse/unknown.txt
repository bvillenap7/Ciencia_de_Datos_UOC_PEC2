flaming object over Syracuse NY;2020-08-01 21:00:00;1 minute;flaming object over Syracuse NY I would like to report a ufo sighting over Syracuse, New York on august 1st at 9 pm local time. 	i was in my backyard and i saw what i thought was a plane flying overhead from east to west. as it came closer i noticed a strange orange flame surrounding the object. 	i could tell it wasn’t just a plane on fire. there was no smoke trail and the flames weren’t behaving as if it was a plane on fire. the orange fire completely engulfed the object as it traveled across the sky. 	I couldn’t make out the shape but i saw a dark object in the center of the flames.  i can’t tell exactly how big it it was. it appeared to be the size of a small passenger plane. 	It traveled along a straight level flight path at a constant speed, about the same speed that a small plane would. after a few seconds it then vanished. 	Several second later i saw an identical object. the second object followed the same flight path at the speed. it was identical in every single way. it had the same dark shape surrounded by an orange flame. it disappeared at the same points the first. 	Neither object made any sound.  A small plane at a similar altitude would be loud and a larger plane at a higher altitude is usually very loud. 	the entire encounter lasted for about a minute and then it was over. 	;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
