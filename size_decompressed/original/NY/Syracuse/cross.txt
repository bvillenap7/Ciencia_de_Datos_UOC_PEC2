UFO over Carousel Center in Syracuse, NY  10/14/2009;2009-10-14 19:05:00;3 minutes;UFO over Carousel Center in Syracuse, NY  10/14/2009 My family and I just had left the Sports Authority at Carousel Center in Syracuse.  We got into the car and proceeded to drive towards the exit for 81 south.  We were still in the drive around the parking lot when my wife screamed, What is that, pointing out the window.  I pulled the car over and looked out and up.  The UFO we witnessed was HUGE and black metallic bottom with several lights around the cross/weird shaped object.  It was smokey looking around the lights, possibly due to the cold  (40 degree) night sky.?   We watched it move slowly left and right as it went away from us at 5-10mph. (approx.) There was absolutely NO SOUND, which baffled me considering it was immense.  I decided to try and follow it.  I drove around to the main entrance of the mall and we saw the UFO again and it had picked up the speed a bit.  We watched it head parallel to Hiawatha Blvd.. slightly SE/E.  As we drove through the city down Salina Street, we all started to breath a! gain. The last time I saw a UFO of this size I was 9 years old.  I am 28 now, my wife is 25.  My 3 children were in the car as well.  One 7, second is 4, and my youngest (which I cant really count as a witness) is almost 1. I called my dad, who lives in Orlando, Florida and told him and also called my brother who lives on the NW side of Syracuse to tell him as well. I am simply amazed at what I just saw.  My family is in awe and my 7 year old daughter was terrified.  Simply spectacular. ((name deleted));43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
Large center light with 3 lights coming from center forming plus sign shape.;2018-08-07 23:00:00;20 minutes;large center light with 3 lights coming from center forming plus sign shape. the object looked like a plus sign with one larger light in the center and three smaller lights to each of the four sides of the plus shape.  At the end of each seemed to look like a faded headlight.  I first saw it about 11:15 PM and by 11:38 PM it seemed to have just up and disappeared.  Then half hour later it was back, watched till the clouds came in maybe 20 more minutes and couldn't see anything.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
