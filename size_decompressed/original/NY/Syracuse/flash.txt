I repeat that it left the atmosphere heading away from earth.  There may have been a second but not 100 % sure. From the last star on the big dipper heading westward (at position the big dipper was in at the time mentioned) near two other visible stars is where the object was seen leaving the earths atmosphere.

Flashes of white light in the Syracuse area, noticed around 11PM EDT, the night of 7/25/13;2013-07-25 23:00:00;unspecified;Flashes of white light in the Syracuse area, noticed around 11PM EDT, the night of 7/25/13 I was listening to Coast to Coast AM and I heard of a strange light sighting that descended and hovered for about 35 minutes and then shot up into the night sky and out of sight.  This was reported to have happened around 9:15PM local time near the Syracuse area.  A friend of mine was another witness to this phenomenon.  The sky was clear outside last night and he said he had no idea what it could be. My dad was coming home from work around 11PM EDT and had a clear view of the Syracuse skyline at certain points along his drive and said he noticed flashes of white light (several times) coming from the direction he was facing (East) almost like lighting –except there was no storm. I was driving back from a friend’s house around the same time (about 11:15PM EDT or so) and noticed the same thing a couple times or so.  I thought it was strange but brushed it off until I heard the report on Coast. I believe the original report I heard on Coast to Coast AM via Peter Davenport that came out of Syracuse is related to what I saw/experienced not too long after the original sighting.  My hope is to add to witness testimony and confirmation of strange white light in the Syracuse area on the night of July 25, 2013.;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
