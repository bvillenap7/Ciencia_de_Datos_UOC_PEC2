Bright white light in the shape of a huge sphere over Onondaga County/Syracuse and moved very fast in all four directions.;2011-12-23 18:00:00;40 min;Bright white light in the shape of a huge sphere over Onondaga County/Syracuse and moved very fast in all four directions. It appeared to be a massive sphere... as big as a star in the sky.  When i was driving i first saw it. It was emitting a huge white light.   After about 30 seconds of looking at it it shot up about 5 thousand feet in the sky in about .2 seconds. It wasnt high in the sky.  Pron no more than 7,000 feet.  There werew clouds out and it was in front of the clouds.  It moved very smoothly like it somehow controled the gravity around it.  It had cycles of where it was bright white to where it was yellowish/red.   If you where looking up in the  sky it was a little below the tree line and above the horrizon. I also saw planes flying toward it.  The planes must have been 1/100 of the size of the obeject.  Then after about 40-45 min the light dimmed and I saw it vanish .;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
3 Red Spherical objects forming large triangle and then disappear!;2014-06-21 22:30:00;5 minutes;3 Red Spherical objects forming large triangle and then disappear! We were driving west on 690 near the Bridge street exit, saw the lights over east Syracuse which seemed to be gliding up towards the sky at a slow speed.   They were red in color and formed large triangle shape and then sped off into the space each craft on their own.  Almost as if they disappeared!;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
Large bright orange craft over Syracuse.;2015-08-30 00:00:00;15 minutes;Large bright orange craft over Syracuse. A large orangish red sphere hovered for approximately 10 minutes.   I called my boyfriend to the back porch when he also witnessed the unidentified flying object.   We watched as the craft moved slowly east to west when it paused and hovered for about 3 minutes.   The craft took off to the northwest as we watched before disappearing.  It was overcast skies and it flew beneath the clouds so it was easy to see.   This was not a usual aircraft.  It was completely silent. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) Hello Peter!  The sighting happened at approximately 12:00 am this morning (Sunday)  I did not get any video because we were kind of in shock as to what we were seeing.  It wasn't until after we came back in that I realized i should have grabbed my phone.   I didn't even know I could even report it until I did some online research to see if we were the only ones who saw the object!!   I will definitely keep my eyes peeled to the sky and if it comes back, I will be ready to record it!! Sent from my iPhone ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date, to reflect a sighting early on Sunday morning, August 30, 2015.  PD));43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
