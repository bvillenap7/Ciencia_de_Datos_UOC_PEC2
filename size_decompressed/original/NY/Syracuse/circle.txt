We were sitting on the bleachers to the right of the youth center, facing towards the Ferris wheel.  It was moving fairly quickly and hovered for a few seconds before moving towards 690.  (It was traveling in a South East direction).;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
Brilliant orange object, followed by another one 10 seconds later, then phased out.;2015-05-02 21:00:00;30 seconds;Brilliant orange object, followed by another one 10 seconds later, then phased out. I live in Chittenango, NY, and in the western sky over Syracuse, I observed these objects.  The first one caught my eye because of the unusual bright orange color.  It showed up a little below what I think is the planet Venus, one of the brightest stars in the sky right now.  It was coming toward me at a slight angle.   Size and intensity both slightly greater than Venus.  Witnessed it on a straight trajectory that lasted for 12 to 15 seconds.  Grew in size slightly as it approached.  Flew a distance of 6 inches on a ruler if held at arm's length across the sky before phasing out over 2 to 3 seconds.   About 10 seconds later a second one phased in, flew the same trajectory for the same distance and time and then also phased out. Perfectly clear night, absolutely no sound, the brightest objects in the sky short of the full moon in the opposite side of the sky. I am a pilot and this was definitely not a plane or a jet's afterburner.  Perfectly round brilliant orange.  Never have seen anything that color in the sky,  ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!;43.0487301816483;-76.159450954821
