Round white and red lighted object over Chautauqua Lake, August 24, 2013;2013-08-24 20:00:00;1 hour;Round white and red lighted object over Chautauqua Lake, August 24, 2013 As we were watching music on the floating stage at 8:30pam I noticed across the lake near Stow, NY a round light.  I thought it was Mars.  It stayed there for about an hour.  It changed from white light to red as if it were rolling.  Other people sitting there noticed it as well.  It was staying in the same spot for an hour until it started moving slowly until it was out of site.  I know helicopters and planes have to move so I don't know what it was.  It appeared to be round but I was not that close to it.  I did not take photos because I did not take my camera.;42.1513;-79.3581
