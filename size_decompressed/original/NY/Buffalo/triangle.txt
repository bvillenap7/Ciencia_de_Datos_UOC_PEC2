Silent, unmarked arrowshaped aircraft flying low over the University at Buffalo.  Was it an experiment?;1971-09-01 15:00:00;less than 1 min.;Silent, unmarked arrowshaped aircraft flying low over the University at Buffalo.  Was it an experiment? I had all but forgotten about it until one evening when I saw a woman on a UFO special.  She described a ship and showed a rough sketch of it.  It shocked me!  I got excited and began to jump around the room shouting, That's mine! That's mine! I saw that!  My companion didn't know what to think of me and was quite incredulous. September, 1971 I was two months from my twentieth birthday.  I was in the habit of taking rather long walks, especially on mild and pretty autumn days as this one was.  I found myself walking along Main Street in Buffalo, in front of the State University of New York at Buffalo.  In those days, there was not yet a northern campus.  I was walking north on Main Street, nearing the front of Hayes Hall.  The sight of it is remeniscent of days when a stately appearance inspired respect in the viewer.  I was busy thinking to myself that there was no one anywhere to be seen.  A thing came flying west over Hayes Hall at a very low altitude, from the direction of Bailey Avenue on the opposite side of the campus.  What was it doing there?  This was not the airspace I would normally see aircraft use.  Was this an experiment of the University?  Was this a military experiment?  This was Sunday.  Niagara Falls was the direction the craft was flying, but why was it so low and who could be flying it?  There were no windows.  As I watched this thing in wonder, I was greatly surprised that there was NO SOUND!  This thing was just above the trees and there was absolutely no sound.  I saw a heat signature at the back of the craft, that somehow gave me a kind of reassurance that I might be watching something I could relate to  something within my experience.  But there was no Sound.  None.  There was no audible competion on the street.  No traffic. No people.  Just me watching that thing fly fly low over the University, the trees, me, the street and the houses.  It flew directly over me.  It was shaped like an arrowhead without a stem.  It's color was green, like an Army jeep a new, clean one.  This was why I thought it might have been a military experiment.  But it had no markings on it.  Not on its side, not on its bottom.  Just the green of a new jeep.  And no sound.  I got so freaked out I still don't remember how I got home that day.  I know it didn't take me long, even though I residence at that time was five to six ! miles aw ay on the corner of Eagle and Madison.  I was so excited relating this sighting to my mother that she had a rough time trying to calm me down.  It was a very disturbing experience.  It is still disturbing repeating it here.  This was my second sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD));42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933

Black triangle with the orange lights at each corner;1999-10-15 23:00:00;30 Seconds;Black triangle with the orange lights at each corner I have seen a lot, it's just that simple.  Since the first evening my mom pointed out two strange lights in the evening sky that eventually took off at light speed, up and at an angle.  Not something a plane can accomplish, especially back in the mid seventies.  There were to white lights, kind of moving back and forth, slowly.  It would move to the right, stop, move back to it's origanl position, then to the left, and then back to it's position again.  It would do this all the time for nights at a time, when it was a clear starry night.  Finally one night when I watching it, it just shot up at an angle at unbelieveable speed and it was gone.  I never experianced it again.  I've seen lights that illuminated, in a strobe like matter, starting with a large bright white light, to a green, red, blue, back to a brillant white again.  Seen that all the time.  Mainly in the fall months when the sky was clear.  My most favorite happened in the late 90's when I used to go out almost every night just to see what I could see.  I was getting ready to head in for the evening when suddenly a black, triangler object, about the size of a small plane hovered like a kite over my head. It was triangler shaped, black, thin, it had 3 round orange lights at each corner.  It was completely silent.  When it finished going over, and I couldn't see the underneth any more, it turned on its side, so I could until it was out of sight..

Sighting of a traingle object the size of a small jet plane with a few light hovering over trees and moving in a slow circular motion.;2000-06-30 22:00:00;2 minutes;Sighting of a traingle object the size of a small jet plane with a few light hovering over trees and moving in a slow circular motion. Well I would have to say the sighting was about 6 years ago or so and I had never really thought about it until a friend of mine had told me about a similar sighting near or around the same time mine took place.  My mother and I were driving back from Lancaster, NY into the city of Buffalo at about 10pm when we noticed a black triangle type object about the size of a small jet plane. Immeditaly my mother and I knew something was wrong because the object was hovering above a bunch of trees and slowly spinning in a circular motion. This made us look at it closer. We then noticed that it did not have wings of any kind, it was a solid traingle with bright white lights in each corner and a few little red lights in the middle of the object. I think what was weirdest about the object is the way it was hovering...I can't really explain it but it was like nothing I had ever seen, it was so still and moving in a perfect circle...the lights in the middle of the craft were moving in a circle also but at rapid speed.  We watched it for a bit and the more we looked the more freaked out we got and my mom decided that she wanted to drive away. We had never stayed to see what it would do next and to this day I get chills talking about it. It was really really weird. ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary date above, which corresponds to the statement by the witness that the event occurred about 6 years ago.  PD));42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Triangle shape object floating in air.;2008-12-10 23:05:00;2 Minuites;Triangle shape object floating in air. As I was driving on the threway past the city exit, saw an object in the sky with many lights coming out of clouds. I thought it was a plane but there were no airports directly in the city. It kept declining till it was only a few thousand feet in the air about a half mile to a mile in the distance. It looked like it was in the shape of a triangle, but just the lines  pointing to the triangle, like a Y sort of. I kept driving slowly, and continued to observe the object till I drove out of sight.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Massive Flat Black triangle  with 3 red lights.;2013-09-09 01:50:00;3 minutes;Massive Flat Black triangle  with 3 red lights. Ok I was driving home around 01:50 on 90 west about 68 miles from PA after the lost of the Bills game.  When I was driving listening to HLN on my Sirius radio.  When a diamond shape object went over my car or at least the wing of the craft did.  It looked like it was flying around 60-70 miles gliding. It had 3 big red lights and the body of the craft was that flat black.  If they didn't have them 3 lights on the front and one on each side of the craft I wouldn't have even known that it was just over me.   Now I thought it was maybe a Stealth but the thing that amazed me is that it was gliding so slow for such a massive, craft and that it made no noise when it was over me when it passed.  I'm just pissed at myself for not stopping and trying to get a pic.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
4 YELLOWISH/ORANGE TRIANGULAR SHAPE OBJECTS IN THE BUFFALO, NY, EAST SIDE SKIES.;2015-10-26 20:00:00;1:43;4 YELLOWISH/ORANGE TRIANGULAR SHAPE OBJECTS IN THE BUFFALO, NY, EAST SIDE SKIES. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE OBJECT(S) WHERE TRIANGULAR SHAPE WITH BRIGHT ORANGE BLINKING LIGHTS.  THEY CAME FROM THE NORTH AND MOVED SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY TO THE SOUTH, MAKING A 90 DEGREE TURN TO THE WEST, AND THE FOURTH ONE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE WITH BRIGHT ORANGE LITE, NOT FLASHING, AND I SEEN TWO JETS CHASING THEM AWAY, AND THEN THEY DISAPPEARED.  FOUR OBJECTS WHERE OBSERVED.  THE BACKGROUND WAS NOTHING BUT THE SKY. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sane and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  We have amended the time above, believing that the sighting occurred at 8:00 p.m..  PD));42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
