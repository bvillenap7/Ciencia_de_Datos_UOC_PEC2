Please Not Post;1997-10-13 03:00:00;4500;Summary : Please Not Post This isn't exactly a UFO sighting, but my dog needed to go out, so about 3:am I put her out, had a drink of water and a smoke, I noticed up in the sky, a comet shaped oject (tear drop at a 45 Degree Angle) between the middle star of Orion and his lower 2 star legs. Its was fading in and out much like Hale-Bop and it was at a roughly 45 degree angle, in for 10 seconds out for 10 seconds... Its was stationary for abut 45-1:30 minutes before the sun came up, then I losted tracked. I understand this wasn't a UFO but a weird comet like object in the sky and I undertstand that you may not be the correct people to speak too but I called my local FBI and they didn't seem to be too interested. I understand this is halloween and they probably get a lot of crack pots but I didn't know were else to turn. The FBI wanted to patch me through to the Air Force and I knew this wasn't a UFO, just a strange comet that I knew wasn't suppost to be in the star cluster of Orion, as I use Orion as my personal guide to find the rest of the night sky everynight. I also understand that tonight we could of been having Ice crystals forming in the sky, but the rest of the stars looked crystal clear, it was just this one tear drop shaped object. If you would like to contact me for a better and more detailed reportâ€¦((Name and number deleted));42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Half a Yellow Blimp;2003-02-15 16:00:00;10 seconds;Half a Yellow Blimp Im not certain what exactly it is that I saw. Maybe I just imagined it. Anyways I just want to know if anyone else saw this. I was out back on a cigarette break at work and talking to two colleagues. While chatting I happened to look up and saw what seemed to be the front side of a blimp that seemed to fade out about a third of the length back. It was a pale yellow color and was immobile. I looked down at my colleagues to see if they saw it too but they werent looking. I told them to look and when I looked back it was gone. The time and date are both approximate. I only found this site tonight and thought that maybe someone else had seen it. It seemed to be just north of Elmwood and Amherst (the street) maybe a few thousand feet up. Whatever.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Grayish star/object moving across sky and then moving upward near Freedom NY;2011-08-26 22:30:00;3 mins;Grayish star/object moving across sky and then moving upward near Freedom NY Hi, I'm a 55 yr old male, I live in Buffalo, NY, and I own a small hunting cabin in Freedom NY. I had never before witnessed any type of a UFO sighting before in my entire life.  I was alone at my cabin the evening of Fri, Aug 26, 2011.  I had been there all day doing some outside work, and then started a small fire in the late evening.  As my fire died out, I decided to look up at the sky for any shooting starts.  About 10 secs after I looked into the eastern sky, I did see my first shooting star.  I then looked into the western sky and I saw another shooting star, or so I thought. This star was moving west to east laterally, and then just stopped and faded out.  After about 2 or 3 secs, it got bright again, and then moved again, and again faded out. It did this at least 7 or 8 times, moving at a equal distance each time and then fading out again.  It then moved at a upward and outward angle from me, again getting very bright when it first moved, and then fading o! ut.   It then moved upward in a straight line, then stopping and fading out again. Then in moved inward and upward toward me, forming a backward letter 'C, then it just shot straight up into the sky until it dissappeared.  I then looked at my watch, and it was approximately 10:35 pm.  I would say that I observed this star/object for about 3 mins. The stars in the sky appeared to have a blueish hue to them, but this star/object appeared to be more of a bright gray color.  Also of the 12 movements that I observed, the last 5 of 6, the object seemed to have a redish/orangeish glow to it after it moved, and then got gray again.  Like I say, I had never before seen any type of UFO in my life, but I will leave you my contact info, if need be, feel free to contact me, and I'm also very curious if any one in my area reported anything similar.  Thank you;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Glowing White Orb/ Starlike/ Changed direction and stoped on a dime..;2012-04-12 19:00:00;3 minutes;Glowing White Orb/ Starlike/ Changed direction and stoped on a dime.. On april 12 2012, my younger brother and I were outside our home when my brother told me hurry look up!!  I looked up and right above our heads about maybe a mile up a bright glowing starlike white orb was moving slowly from west (canada) to east direction.... by the time i pulled out my camera phone it was now more so infront of us rather then above like it was when we first spoted it.. I first took a picture then i switched over to video and started filiming.. while filming i kept losing sight of it and then we couldnt see it anymore..  However when i went into the house i watched the video on my computer... while watching i see the orb of white light go out..  then two seconds later it appears to the left of the screen.. i watched it over and over and started to mess with the video settings.. anyway i figured out that when i turn the brightness up a little bit and the contrast you can actual see the orb switch direction and shot from south to north then sto! p on a dime.. It then moves a little back east and vanishes... I have the adjusted video and picture...;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933

UFO sighted in Buffalo, New York.;2015-08-12 22:30:00;<1 minute;UFO sighted in Buffalo, New York I went to my car to get a box and I decided to look up into the sky because the Perseid meteor shower was going on.   To my surprise in the horizon I saw a craft with two blinking lights white to green flashing.  It was lower than a normal jet airplane would be and the rate of travel was quite fast.   The color was clear and blended in with the night sky I could literally see through the craft the outline of the craft was shaped like a piece of toast.  It's the best way that I can describe it.   No sounds it just came over the horizon, flew above me, and went over top of the tree and house next door to me in less than a minute.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Black cloud hovering close to ground disappears in front of my eyes;2015-09-10 11:00:00;15 seconds;Black cloud hovering close to ground disappears in front of my eyes Today is a beautiful day, the sky is a bright blue color, and the clouds are all white.   I was driving on the thruway next to Lake Erie and I noticed a small black cloud hovering maybe 200 feet above the thruway over the water.  The cloud was easy to differentiate because it was so close to the ground.   I slowed down and started watching it.  I was wearing tan-colored lens sunglasses, and when I took them off, I could hardly notice the black cloud.  When I put them back on, the cloud was very visible.   I watched it for about 15-20 seconds, and right before my eyes, it disappeared! I have never seen anything like it before.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Glowing Green Orb and Vapor Trail of it's path;2019-10-11 20:23:00;3-4 minutes;Glowing Green Orb and Vapor Trail of it's path Was standing in my back yard looking in the sky, saw a vapor trail rising up from the ground, pointed it out a friend ans we both watched it for a minute or two as it continued to  gain altitude.  At that point i decided to take a picture, during the time i was getting my phone ready to take a picture, the UFO had done a 180 degree loop and cut across it's vertical vapor trail and continued in an eastward direction...  Afterwards when I looked at the photo you could very clearly see the object as a glowing Green orb.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
