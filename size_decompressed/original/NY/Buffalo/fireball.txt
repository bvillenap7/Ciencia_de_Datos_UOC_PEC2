Balls of fire floating (not dropping) across the sky in Buffalo, NY 10-15-10.;2010-10-15 21:27:00;several mins;Balls of fire floating (not dropping) across the sky in Buffalo, NY 10-15-10. I stepped outside of a night club on the night of October 15, 2010 at approximately 9:27pm.  I saw several objects in the night sky floating by from my viewing right to my viewing left.  I was in a suburb of Buffalo, NY.  I grabbed my cell phone out of my pocket and took a few pictures.  My cell phone at the time didn't have any zooming capabilities.  The objects looked like balls of fire floating by.  They did not appear to be dropping in altitude like flares do.  They seemed to be orangeish/reddish/yellowish in nature....like fire. I even sent the pictures to a local TV station who put one of the pictures on the air in a short story reporting that a viewer (myself) saw some unexplained lights in the skies of West Seneca, NY. I showed the pictures to several people asking if anyone else had seen them.  Only one person told me that they saw something similar 2 hours earlier several miles away in the skies before dark.  My experience occurred during the dark night.  I remember pointing and asking a few strangers outside to look and asked what they could be.  They thought it was odd and didn't know.  I couldn't count the number of objects due to them moving as well as some appearing further away.  Trees also cut off the viewing capabilities. The objects all seemed to be moving at the same speed in the same direction.  They didn't appear to be dropping or rising in altitude.  They were moving slow enough for me to observe, but too fast to keep observing and taking pictures for more than a few minutes.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
three UFOs seen over Buffalo, NY;2011-08-13 22:40:00;4 minutes;three UFOs seen over Buffalo, NY Going down the driveway on way to work and just passing sister's house {lives at other end of way} and noticed an orange oblong object in the sky and thought it was a plane in distress, I then realized it wasn't a plane.  Got out of the car and yelled for sister & nephew to come outside.  I went back to my car and seen 2 red orbs in the sky {house hid them at 1st}.  The 3rd {orange} one was now also red and round and followed behind the other two.  They went from west to east. The first 2 turned headed upwards and went further into space.  They turned white before going out of view.  The 3rd one took a minute, following the same path, before turning white and disappearing.  Took a photo with my cell phone of the 3rd red orb but photo appears as a boomerang.  Could this be a camouflage by the craft?  http://wtv-zone.com/onegal/UFO2011.gif;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Orange fireball witnessed in the sky west-by-northwest of Buffalo.;2012-03-19 22:00:00;3 minutes;Orange fireball witnessed in the sky west-by-northwest of Buffalo. We observed an orangeish fireball shape in the sky, west by northwest of north Buffalo.    (We were on Main Street, slightly south of Northrup St., for what that's worth.)  It appeared to be a single rapidly and irregularly flickering light source.  There was conventional air traffic visible in the same general region of the sky at that time, and the difference between this light source and the planes was pretty obvious: those had regular blinking and distinct lights, even at a great distance, while this thing did not. It did not keep a perfectly straight course as near as I could tell--there appeared to be some wobbling, although not all of us agreed on that.  (At least one of us thought it was an illusion caused by the light flickering.)  My first thought was that it was a large flying paper lantern, but it was much too bright, much too high up, and after a minute it was clear that it was ascending too quickly for that. It was very clearly visible in the middle of a heavily light-polluted metropolitan area, so it wasn't a faint light. It appeared to be ascending very rapidly, much faster than I have ever personally seen a conventional aircraft rise.  Closest thing I could compare it to from my own experience is a space shuttle launch I saw about ten years ago, but this left no exhaust trail.  After about two minutes, it began to dim and disappeared completely over a ten second period.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933

Bright orange orb moving swiftly;2012-07-29 22:00:00;2 minutes;Bright orange orb moving swiftly Sunday night, 7/29, at around 10pm I saw a definite UFO.  Was BRIGHT orange (I mean very very orange), yet very distant.  Easily 10x brighter than Venus.  It seemed distant, but was moving VERY fast in what seemed to be a straight line.  Probably moved across about 90 degrees of sky in about 1-2 minutes.   This is about 10 miles south of Buffalo, NY.  It was moving from southwest to northeast.   The sky was clear, starry, yet in the direction the thing was moving I had seen very strong lightning minutes earlier, possibly heat lightning.   The flashes illuminated the sky/clouds in that direction.  I checked weather radar and did see a small thunderstorm cell in that area.   I know for a fact it was not a passenger jet or helicopter.   I found it incredibly unusual and immediately told my girlfriend about it.   We went back out and watched for a while but saw nothing else unusual.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
4 flame colored lights moving east to west;2013-02-22 07:20:00;1-2 minutes;4 flame colored lights moving east to west I was walking my dog when I noticed a bright flame colored ball moving faster than a typical plane.  It was also flying much lower. As I moved to the front of my house I saw 3 more of the same thing.   No noise, no trail all moving east to west, and they were so bright that you couldn't make out a shape.  There is an air force base at niagara falls, which could explain what the objects were, however, there is a post from Rochester, NY, dated 2/16 which describes the exact same thing I saw.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933

We were watching the fireworks, and at about 9:30 p.m., I heard the neighbor across the street say to his daughter, What the hell is that?  He was very excited so I looked up and seen an orange fireball object traveling South to North at a steady pace and then it would just fade away.   Altogether within about an hour, I seen 3 of them, all above us, but not next to each other.  The pictures I took did not come out good, it just looks like a light in the sky, it didn't even pick up the orange color.   This is the very first time that I seen something, and I was very excited...I already was a believer.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933

Fireballs appear twice in sky then disappear.;2014-08-19 21:00:00;2 minutes;Fireballs appear twice in sky then disappear. A bit after 9:00 p.m., I went outside.  It was dark out, the sun had set, and the only light came from the houses of neighbors.   I sat out there for a while and noticed an orange light in the sky.  After a few seconds, I immediately knew this wasn't any normal craft, as it moved around in a way that would be impossible for an airplane or a helicopter.  I watched it as it moved through the sky, relative to me, it moved two or three inches.   Soon enough it began to blink, and then disappeared in the sky.   I came back outside about half an hour later, and after watching the same spot in the sky, saw it again. It followed a course very similar to the one before, moving in all the same directions, and then disappearing again.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933

I went outside and looked up at the sky.  All of a sudden an extremely large bright elongated teardrop shape fluorescent  to dark jade green light flew across the sky horizontally.  It was moving so fast, it was a matter of seconds and I couldn't see it anymore as it made its way from the western sky to the eastern sky.  It seemed like it was flying low. It was far below the stars or the path of a plane.  There was a very bright white flash of light behind it.  There wasn't any noise.  No other visible objects or colors were seen.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
