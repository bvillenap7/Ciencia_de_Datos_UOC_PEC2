A disk like object hovering over a lamp post, Red lights circling around it.;1972-06-24 23:00:00;?;A disk like object hovering over a lamp post, Red lights circling around it. When I was 14 years old, two of my brothers and myself were standing in front of our house. The night was clear and warm, we were enjoying the beginning of summer. As we were sitting on the porch, we heard a humming sound. All three of us looked up and saw a saucer shaped craft hovering above a lamp post. It hovered for a few minutes, then it started to move away at a slow pace. My brothers and I proceeded to follow it, going up a side street by our house. We followed it all the way to a school (# 3) by our home. It landed on the roof of the school, then disappeared. My brothers and myself were back in front of the house, without knowing how we got there. To this very day I cannot remember how we got there. One of my brothers has since passed away, the other brother has been diagnosed with epilepsy. I have been diagnosed with lupus. Is this conincidence, or did something unexplainable happen to us that night? I continue to have vivid dreams of UFO's, cornfields, airplanes, and the like all the time. I watch the Sightings regularly, in hopes of finding someone who has experienced something similar to what my brothers and myself did. I have seen people on the program describing their experiences, and it sounds like they are living my life. It is a very eerie feeling. I want to find out what happened to the lost time, and how we got back home. I am 45 years old now, and it is still a mystery that i cannot let go of. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The ship was close to my house and hovered over trees on the next street and then zipped off like the speed of light.;2009-05-02 07:50:00;2 minutes;The ship was close to my house and hovered over trees on the next street and then zipped off like the speed of light. My brother and I were waiting for the school bus and we were standing inside our house behind a glass door.  So I see look up at the sky and I turn my head to the left and I see the ship zip across the house and street and stopped and hovered over the trees on the next street over and just sat there for a minute and the zipped off and never saw it again.  It was silver saucer like ship but I did see the top of the ship because I think it was camouflage or it was a small top.  I didn’t see any aliens just the silver ship that didn’t make any sound or make the trees mover because of how low and fast it was when it went over the trees.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Round craft with orange lights seen in Buffalo, New York;2013-07-04 22:30:00;2 minutes;Round craft with orange lights seen in Buffalo, New York I was compelled to go to my window and look up into the sky, when I saw a round object with orange lights around its rim sought of flashing but not always.  It was moving in a southwest to northeast direction. no sound.  Then a second object with same description maybe 1000 meters behind the first object. There was I think 6 orange lights, no sound and moving in a determined direction. not floating.  The height was same as a small plane flying. The size of object was about 100 feet round. The center of the object was dark.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Disk shaped, four lights, humming noise.;2015-10-18 20:13:00;~4 seconds;Disk shaped, four lights, humming noise. One UFO spotted, had four circle shaped lights, two red and two green, shape not very clear due to clouds, appeared to be a disk.  Flew diagonally at about the speed of an airplane, seemed to be tilting or rotating.  Was making a humming noise, hard to describe, sort of like a mechanical howl.  Couldn't see color, I would assume black, but it was dark, so color might have just not been visible.

Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information, so we are unable to contact him/her, in order to confirm the date.  PD));42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
