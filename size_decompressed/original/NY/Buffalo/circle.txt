Circular jet black object remained motionless in the sky for 10 minutes then smoothly moved away out of sight.;2000-02-12 17:00:00;10-15 minutes;Circular jet black object remained motionless in the sky for 10 minutes then smoothly moved away out of sight. I began looking at the sky due to a great deal of plane exhaust trails,  there were a few that were very dark, nearly black, many of these trails also ran parallel to eachother. As I came into a clearer view of the sky I saw a round black object remaining motionless. Initially I thought this was simply a child's balloon that had been lost. This was near a supermarket so this does happen sometimes. However, this thing (judging by its distance and height) was far too large to be a balloon, also its stillness was strange enough to capture my attention. After about ten minutes planes began to appear, one with the black exhaust trail. Within a  minute of the planes' appearance the object began moving away in an arc, and was gone within a minute or so. I thought I may have seen some movement on the sides of the thing, not unlike the movements of a bird's wings (this is perhaps the strangest part of the whole affair). My initial thought was weather balloon, yet this was in a very populated area and no where near the airport or weather stations. Also, the absence of lights on the object, to me, disqualified it as a plane. I had been pulled over in the parking lot of a supermarket, when I came out there were planes all over the sky, six all at about the relatively same altitude and running parallel. Does this sound like a military excercise?;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Bright white light moving south from Buffalo, NY at nominal speed;2007-07-30 05:15:00;5-10 minutes;Bright white light moving south from Buffalo, NY at nominal speed (5:15 to 5:30 AM), I was riding my bike along Nottingham Terrace along Delaware Park in Buffalo, New York. I was looking at the sky and spotted a light coming in from the North. I stopped and watched as is got closer and passed overhead.  The things that interested me most was 1) It was NOT flashing. 2) There was NO sound. 3) There was no trails of any kind and NO smoke. 4) It was an incredibly bright white light.  It never dimmed. In fact it stayed the same brightness as it passed over me and only faded as it got far away. I could see it for a good 20 miles after it passed over me. I compared it with the few stars left in the sky and it was incredibly big and very far away, or close, and so bright it just looked big.

Bright white circular like light moving north, northest from the Elmwood strip in Buffalo, New York.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS??  PD));2007-08-03 21:30:00;5 minutes;Bright white circular like light moving north, northest from the Elmwood strip in Buffalo, New York. This is the second sighting of exactly the same craft so i am going to post the same report with some small additions.  Between 8:45 pm (eastern time) and about 9:30pm the object was traveling over Buffalo, (where I was at was on Elmwood Ave. and Bryant streets at work) coming this time from south, southwest and traveling roughly north, northwest. The object was incredibly bright, and I would say as bright as Venus when it was visible here.  The things that interested me most was 1) It was NOT flashing. 2) There was NO sound. 3) There was no trails of any kind and NO smoke. 4) It was an incredibly bright white light that seems to be round.  The size was either massive because it was close, or it was the light it was emitting was just very bright. It never dimmed. In fact it stayed the same brightness as it passed over me and only faded as it got far away. Had the hospital not been blocking a further view, I estimate I would have seen it for a few miles. I compared it with the few stars left in the sky and it was incredibly big and very far away, or close, and so bright it just looked big.  The last time I saw this was on July 31, 2007 at approximately 5:30am (eastern time) traveling in the exact opposite direction.

Believe its Jupiter. 8:16 - Not Jupiter. Possible mars, don’t fully believe it's Mars though. 8:18 - Notice object is dimming 8:26 - Go to set up scope 8:28 - Scope is on porch 8:29 - Object is in finder scope 8:30 - See Mars like object in main eyepiece 8:31 - See second small point of light orbiting main object 8:33 - See tether/ tractor beam “connecting” two objects 8:35 - Wife is on porch with me and looks through scope 8:37 - Attached tension spring 8:37 - Tried to put in high power eyepiece 8:38 - Put in main eyepiece again 8:39 - Found main object and saw it was blue 8:40 - Neighbor is with us 8:43 - Tried to use high power eyepiece again 8:43 - Moon filter off 8:44 - Object no longer visible  It was about 8:15 PM EDST in Buffalo, NY. I as well as my wife and a neighbor were sitting on our neighbors porch as the sun was setting. We were talking about various things when I spotted a light in the sky. It was reddish orange at first sighting and fairly bright. It was stationary to the naked eye and no other visible objects or distinct lights around it. At first I though it was Jupiter and continued to watch for a minute. I then realized that it was to close to the zenith to be Jupiter and began to think it could be Mars but I was not sure due to my not seeing a star chart in about a year and wasn’t sure if Mars was visible yet. So I proceeded to my apartment next door and went upstairs to put my telescope on our porch and try to view it. As time went on the object dimmed very slowly. It was about 8:30 EDST when I got my scope out and had the object in my viewfinder. I then viewed it through my main eyepiece. What I saw looked almost exactly like Mars in size, shape, hue, and reflectivity. It appeared to have an atmosphere/clouds. The object had the orange/ red color but was not emitting the light on its own. As I stared I though what I saw next was caused by my eyes playing tricks on me. I saw a tiny point of white light orbiting the main object extremely fast in a teardrop shape around the object. If the main object were the point of a teardrop than the tiny point of light was moving in a clockwise motion as viewed through the scope. The point of light moved out towards the 10 O’clock  position of the main object and went out approximately 5-8 lengths of the main object in the teardrop fashion. It concluded 1 rotation at about the 1 to 2 O’clock range of the main object. One rotation was approximately 2 and ½ seconds. I started shouting to my wife, who was still downstairs on our neighbors porch, to come up to my scope quickly because I am seeing something amazingly not natural. It is now about 8:35 EDST and she is up with me. Whilst she was coming up though, I continued to view the object throu! gh my sc ope and noticed something amazing. I saw some form of a tether/ tractor  beam that appeared to be connecting the small point of light with the main object. The tether appeared to be the same hue of the main object, reddish/ orange, but it was very faint but defiantly there. My wife looked through my scope and saw what I saw, the point orbiting the main object, minus the tether due to her wearing glasses.  I looked back one more time and stared for about 1 minute than began to adjust my scope, as I hadn’t attached either tension springs.  I attached one tension spring to the left side of the scope. When I finished that I got out a 1.25” 9mm lens and tried to find the object again. I couldn’t so I put on the 2” eyepiece again and found it rather quickly but what I saw surprised me once again. The object had turned blue. It still looked the same as before with all the same features but it was just blue.  Also the small object orbiting had disappeared and so was the tether/ tractor beam. It is now about 8:40 and our neighbor is now up with us and looked through the eyepiece. He saw the blue object and was disappointed that it wasn’t something waving at him. Well I watched it for a few more minutes  and then decided to try the higher power lens. I put the lens in and noticed right away that I had forgot to take the moon filter off and so I quick took it off. It was now about 8:43. Once I put the eyepiece back in I lost sight of the object.  I immediately ran inside and began typing this for accuracy of time/description. This is the best I can do without have the right questions asked. Feel free to contact me for anything more that I may have no added in as I didn’t know the info was needed.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933

I saw 2 unknown flying objects on sequential nights.

The one the night before was cigar shaped, like a blimp with orange and white lights and the next day saw something about the size of a basketball going straight orange with a red light in it I got to videotape both sightings but my phone has poor quality but up close these were both equally amazing objects that made no sound and whizzed straight by and no one blinked twice except me I guess.    I've attached the videos as well.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Circular light moving and rotating, blinking lights along side of it;2021-04-08 20:30:00;5 minutes;Circular light moving and rotating, blinking lights along side of it My husband and i were sitting outside on our front steps arou d 8:30pm on Thursday, April 8, 2021. The sky was perfectly clear and my husband thought we saw a shooting star.  But it definitely was not! It was circular in shape, blinking periodically..sometimes blinking white, other times the light looked more purple in color.  We then thought it was some kind of aircraft or ufo. There was a line of lights that began to blink at the same time along each side of the circular light (similar to the way lights blink on an airplane at night) but it was not an airplane.  Sometimes it would move in a circular motion, other times it looked like an orb of some kind.  We have pictures but doesnt do it justice to what we saw in the clear, spring sky.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
