Two bright fast-moving star-like objects with one traveling in a zig-zag motion.;1979-10-01 21:00:00;5-10 sec;Two bright fast-moving star-like objects with one traveling in a zig-zag motion. I observed two bright star-like objects (about as bright as the star Sirius) moving from the eastern sky in a west-north-west direction almost directly overhead. These two objects were moving very fast. They were fairly close to each other and traveling at the same speed.  One was moving in a linear path and the other was traveling in a zig-zagging motion (Now what on earth can move like that?).  I’d say that they covered about 90 degrees of sky in approximately 5 seconds. Seeing this literally sent shivers down my spine.

I was skating at the end of my street with my friend jordan and we looked up into the sky and we saw a ligt that was really fast. It changed color, purple, blue, red, white, green over and over. There was also no sound. It was really cool because we both knew it was a UFO , we were like wow! A day or 2 after that night we looked UFO's up and some books said they didnt have no sound even if they were going really fast and I watched a UFO show and it showed the same colors the UFO blinked over and over. It was so neat. After we saw the UFO that night. We say 2 shooting stars. I loved that night it was the best night of my life! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Trio of lights seen over Buffalo/Williamsville NY;2004-09-18 21:30:00;10-15 minutes;Trio of lights seen over Buffalo/Williamsville NY At first sight, there were three cross shaped lights hovering in the sky and shifting positions left and right slightly. After approximately five minutes, two of them drifted below the tree line (Approximately a mile away I estimate) while the third one remained in sight. At this point, a jet passed by my bedroom window on the opposite side, and much closer than the lights making the usual noises associated with a jet. A family member brought me a pair of binoculars, but even still the light only became a more visible cross shape with no definable object behind it.  At this point, the light moved up into the sky slightly, then to the right, then left, before dropping straight down behind the same tree line the others had gone behind.  Also, after two of the lights dissappeared, there appeared to be another distant light behind and to the right of the remaining light, although this might have been another plane.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933

I figured it was just a plane, but since I had seen three mysterious lights in the same area earlier in the week, I decided to watch to see if they behaved in a similair fashion.  After appearing to hover for a few minutes, the lights suddenly began to bob and weave, rapidly ascending a short distance then falling back below the tree line, appearing a short distance away in a few seconds, then moving in apparently random patterns including figure eights and loops.  I am not currenly aware of any helicopter or plane that could have done this without some change in the quality and direction of the lights.  Also, I do live relatively close to the Buffalo International Airport, but I also saw a plane pass by far overhead while the lights were moving in patterns, and it most definetly did not resemble what I was seeing.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933

Two small, dim orange lights abruptly do a 180 turn, one engaging in eratic zig-zag motions;2007-05-03 23:00:00;5 minutes;Two small, dim orange lights abruptly do a 180 turn, one engaging in eratic zig-zag motions This observation occurred at approximately 2300 hrs EDT on 5/3/07 in Buffalo, NY.  The sighting was also observed by my 26 year old son.  We were standing in a downtown parking lot (near Shea's Theater) when I spotted the bright star Arcturus in the eastern sky. As I looked at the star I noted a small (smaller than the star) object emitting dim, non-blinking orange light moving toward and somewhat above Arcturus from the south (my right) heading north.  At first I thought it must be a very distant aircraft, but its later behavior negated that assumption. 	As this first object moved past the star, I noticed a second, identical object following behind the first, and moving just below Arcturus.  Once past the star, the top object (first one sighted) seemed to slow while the second object caught up with it.  They moved close to one another – and then completely reversed course, now moving south (toward my right).  As they did so, the bottom object engaged in a rapid up-down zig-zag pattern, which removed all doubt that these things were ordinary aircraft. 	The two objects then flew off together, maintaining a constant separation, and appeared to circle around the city to the south, west, and then north.  We were passengers in a car with other people so finally had to quit our observations before the objects disappeared.  Again, these were tiny (compared to most visible stars), dim reddish or orange lights.  We could not make out any shapes beyond that. 	I am a PhD professor, geologist and planetary scientist.  I teach college astronomy courses and have been avidly observing the skies for over 50 years.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933

Bright light moving towards plane getting bigger and brighter, dissapears before contact;2008-07-20 22:00:00;30-45 sec.;Bright light moving towards plane getting bigger and brighter, dissapears before contact One evening as we were living the driveway, facing west, I spotted a bright light, which at first I thought was a plane, but there was already one in the same area in the sky and looked different. This light at first was just sitting there, then started moving towards the plane getting bigger and brighter as it moved. I thought for sure it was going to hit the plane, but once it got to it it disappeared. How fast it was going and how the light got much bigger and brighter as it moved closer couldn't have been anything other than a UFO. My boyfriend at the time looked at me and asked what was wrong because my face expression showed shock and excitement. It doesn't sound that intense, but it was amazing to me.

A green one on the left and red one on the right. Neither were blinking. The object or objects flew without sound (at least none I could hear with my window rolled down over the sound of my rather quiet 4 cylinder Honda Civic engine) on an upward diagonal toward HSBC arena and the lake (lake Erie) to my left. I could not see a defining shape in the black night sky. Pondering if it was a plane or not and if so wondering where any blinking lights were-The craft or crafts made a 90 degree angle and flew directly over my vehicle at a high rate of speed (again I heard no audible sound.)

Red/green lights seen over Buffalo New York from Fort Erie, Canada.;2009-12-04 18:00:00;20 mins;Red/green lights seen over Buffalo New York from Fort Erie, Canada. I was driving home from work in Fort Erie,Ontario, Canada, which is on the border of Buffalo, New York.  I stopped at a red light and noticed above the tree's 2 pinkish red blinking lights.  I noticed this because of the colour and the fact that the lights were on top of each other, not beside each other like an airplane.  I watched for a few seconds when the lights suddenly changed to a bright green colour, then immediately afterwards, they changed direction on a dime and started going in the other direction. I thought this was wierd so I decided to follow them.  I drove down to a rest area beside the water about a kilometer away, and could see that the lights were directly over Buffalo, New York.  The lights floated around, changing directions quickly, going left, right, up and down and backwards and forwards.  Then the lights started going up and to the left, slowly slowing down until they came to a stop.   At this time they changed colours again back to the pinkish red colour.   All of a sudden directly below the lights another set of lights appeared out of nowhere.  These lights were an orangish yellow.  It slowly went up towards the first set of lights and then passed it.  The red lights then started moving again, following the orange lights.  Then as quickly as the orange lights appeared, they disappeared.  Then the red lights started moving closer to the water, then turned left and went deeper into Buffalo, getting smaller.  I watched this for about 2 minutes and then left.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933

It was seen in peripheral vision at first, and upon looking up, a solitary white/yellow orb of light quickly raced across the sky, curved right, then left, then right again, in an S form, before disappearing.  The local airport was nearby, but the object was moving much too quickly to be any kind of commercial aircraft (and had been moving away from the airfield).  If it had been military or an otherwise highly-technical aircraft, there was no sonicboom, nor could an aircraft turn so sharply.

Blinding blue/white light over Buffalo, NY.;2012-09-13 00:50:00;less than 5 seconds;Blinding blue/white light over Buffalo, NY I was smoking a cigarette at approx. 12:50AM EST.

The light was blue on the outside and had a white core.  As soon as I saw it, it was gone. Vanished completely into the sky.  I was recently on a flight to Florida and I would estimate the altitude of the object to be under 5,000 feet.  There is an air port here in Buffalo, and for a minute I thought it was a plane crash, however there was absolutely no sound whatsoever.

Multiple moving lights in the sky.;2020-08-22 22:00:00;~5 minutes;Multiple moving lights in the sky First I want you to know I am an alien skeptic.  I have an open mind but I'm only going to believe what I see and experience myself. I make no claims these were alien objects.  I would classify them as unexplained moving lights in the night sky. Because I'm in an urban area with houses and trees all around the horizon and I only have a cheap compass my orientation may be slightly off. On Saturday, August 22, 2020, at 9PM EST I went out to see if I could view comet Neowise.  I had been trying to find it all summer without luck. I'm in a urban area with a lot of light pollution and the comet is faint so I never had any success. At 10PM EST I went out again. By this time it was fully dark and there were large white puffy clouds moving swiftly from WNW but the space between the clouds was * crystal clear * and I could easily see stationary stars. Suddenly I noticed a fast moving star traveling from WSW coming from behind clouds.  It was white and as bright as Venus.  At first I thought it might be the International Space Station as it was moving at a constant speed high behind the clouds but since it was moving slower I discounted it as the ISS. I watched it travel in a straight line moving from WSW to North at a constant speed disappearing and reappearing between breaks in the clouds. When it passed the Big Dipper, two more bright white moving stars came into view between the clouds. One heading WNW and one heading West. They were dimmer than the first moving star and moving at about the same rate of speed but slower (I assume because they were farther away). Unfortunately the white puffy clouds were increasing so the moving stars were difficult to track as they disappeared behind the fast moving puffy-white clouds. As the clouds were increasing I began to look for spaces between clouds and I looked almost directly up and saw another very bright moving star heading WSW. It was white and as bright as the first moving star but the clouds were increasing and it disappeared behind the clouds .  I eventually lost track of the first moving star behind the ever increasing cloud-cover as it traveled North.  The moving stars weren't an illusion caused by the moving clouds.  I could clearly see fixed, stationary stars and the moving stars.  The entire incident lasted less than 5 minutes. I'm about 5 miles from an airport to the North and during this same period of time I could see two low flying planes approaching the airport in front of the clouds (lower than the clouds). The moving white stars were not planes. The planes were easy to identify because they have red, green, and white blinking landing lights and moved like planes I see all the time.   I also had another incident on the last Saturday of May.  It was 10PM EST and I went out to toss some trash. It was a clear night.  Whenever I go outside at night I always take a moment to look at the night sky seeing which constellations are visible. As I said, I live in an urban area with lots of light pollution and there are houses and trees that block my view so I'm limited by what I can see usually only the Big Dipper and Orion depending on the time of year. On a good clear night if I look out a second floor window I can see the Pleiades. Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn are easy to locate.  As I turned to the house to go inside, I was standing in the driveway looking SE. About 45-50 degrees above the horizon I saw a redish-orange star. At first I thought it might be Mars which is fairly common and easy to see. However it just didn't look exactly like Mars. My next thought was it might be a candle sky lantern someone released so I stood still to see if it would drift. It didn't. It was stationary.  Then, without notice, this redish-orange star shot directly away from me and in less than a second disappeared.  After these two sighting I have gone outside when the night sky is clear but I haven't seen anything since.  Best regards;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
