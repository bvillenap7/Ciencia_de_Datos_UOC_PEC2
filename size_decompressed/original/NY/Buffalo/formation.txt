This object was not a plane, it was not clouds(the sky was clear at that time), it was not the smoke from my neighbors chimney or a falling star(meteor)and it was not a flock of birds flying in formation(although the latter did crosss my mind at first because of the formation it was in but it was traveling much too fast). What I saw was something shaped roughly like a boomarang, it made no sound, left no trail in the sky and the only thing that defined it's shape was what seemed to be dots of white light, several rows of them. It wasn't light like starlight or streetlight or any light I have ever seen, it was just white dots of light, glowing white dots. It seemed to be traveling northwest to southeast at the time I saw it and I watched it till the tree branches obscured it and it disappeared over the housetops. It's shape never fluctuated from this boomarang formation. I stood there saying to myself, what the @#&* was that?, and would have probably just left it at that but as I was standing there contemplating what it was I just saw I noticed this same shaped object with the white light further down the horizan. It was further south closer to the downtown area of the city(Buffalo) and now seemed to be traveling east to west till it disappeared.  This thing was so strange I probably would have talked myself out of believing I had seen what I had just seen if I had not seen it twice. After I saw this object the second time further down the horizan I stayed out for probably another 10 minutes or more searching the sky for this thing till my toes were getting numb before going in. I don't know what it was that I saw that night but I do know what it wasn't and I'm wondering if there were any other reports in the Buffalo, Western NY area regarding this strang object close to the time I saw it??  Thanks;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933

This seven light boomerang shaped formation appeared out of the southeast moving northwest as I looked closer,  thinking it may have been a formation of jets from the Niagara Falls Air Base, one craft darkly appeared. No sound, seven white (a bit brighter than a normal magnituide star) lights like a flock of geese. It faded from view after about 15 seconds, just as it appeared. I'm still upset.(Angle of elevation was about 30 degees.);42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933

They trave;2004-09-18 22:30:00;10 sec;We observed 7 circular lights in V formation traveling WNW-ESE. Lights in the rear were criss-crossing within the formation. They traveled approx 110 degrees of sky in 10 seconds or less, silently. We live within 5 miles of Buffalo Niagara International Airport and are very familiar with approach and landing patterns, and have never seen any traveling in this direction. The altitude is hardest to estimate we can only say that we see aircraft traveling higher and lower than the lights observed.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
5 Bright lights float over home;2010-03-19 23:00:00;10 sec;5 Bright lights float over home Total of 5 candle like glowing crafts seen in different formations gliding over house.  First began at approx. 23:00 with a large, fast moving, blue lighten (6 blue lights), curved, arch like formation over some trees in the distance. 2 witnesses saw this event, the third missed it by a fraction of a second.  About 15 minutes later, a similar craft with 4 lights was seen moving much faster in a different direction across the sky, except this time it was a light grayish-brown shade.  Moments later, in the opposite side of the sky, 5 very distinct, very bright lights slowly glided across the sky.  These lights had a symmetrical formation and moved in and out like a flowing organism.  All three witnesses were taken by the sight, and amazed at the possibility of three sightings in a matter of minutes.  Then, about 10 minutes later, out of the center of the sky appeared two, candle like lights floating symmetrically across the sky, to the edge of the horizon.  Flowing i! n and out in perfect motion. And again these two appeared in the same way another 5 minutes later.  Next, after about 15 minutes of waiting, a single glowing object appeared on the far side of the horizon and floated behind the home, out of sight to the witnesses.  Then, to conclude the experience, 5 very prominent, bright candle like objects, floated very slowly, very low over the home.  They drifted further and closer to each other and seem to have a distinct pattern to them.  They drifted slowly across the sky, and went out of sight approximately 45 seconds after they appeared. the last event was significantly longer than any other sighting of the night.  After this, we saw nothing else and clouds rolled in from the south east.  We noticed that all crafts traveled in the direction of the stars, and each of them had a distinct, candle glowing like form.  However, the first were bright blue.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Low flying starlike orbs in urban area, triangle formation make for the sky silently at at unseen speeds;2010-06-01 05:00:00;10 Sec.;Low flying starlike orbs in urban area, triangle formation make for the sky silently at at unseen speeds Buffalo, New York, June 1, 2010 05:00 No footage or photos, sighting experience of 5-10 seconds in duration. For self descriptions, my wife and I (mid 30s) are generally open minded and politically moderate individuals, our first such experience. From our 2nd floor patio swing in the downtown area, gazing east we observed 3 very bright objects, possibly orbs which appeared from over the downtown rooftops (amazed so bright despite all the light pollution of our downtown neighborhood), possibly 1500 ft altitude at a distance of less than 2 miles.  These bright white starlike objects were in triangle formation, flying low with a sort of tilt or plane to our view that sheared the shape of the triangle. The objects then appeared to get much dimmer as they appeared to move at an alarming speed ascending, silently and maintaing perfect triangle form. Now also more at a perpendicular plane to our view as it ascended, this triangle was a perfect right triangle, it ascended slightly northward and completely zenith out of our view due to our own rooftop. Whether it left the atmosphere is something left to question. My wife and I chased out into the streets to see if we could still see more, but other buildings and canopied trees blocked our view.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Four dimly lit triangular objects whistle as they pass low over Buffalo, NY;2011-12-26 21:15:00;10 seconds;Four dimly lit triangular objects whistle as they pass low over Buffalo, NY A friend and I were standing on the roof of a 10-story building at night, around 9:15 on December 26th (2011) in Buffalo, NY.  I noticed four dimly lit objects over the city, moving in a straight line from the direction of Lake Erie towards the northeast.  At first glance I thought these were the lights on the wings of a far away commercial aircraft, but appeared too low in the sky and were approaching too quickly. I noticed a corresponding whistling sound as they approached.  The sound was not unlike the sound from those whistling Nerf balls.  It was changing and varied, as if there were more than one Nerf ball sounding at once. It was not loud, but clearly audible.  I could then see that there were four separate objects.  They were black or dark gray, seemingly lit on the underside from the lights of the city. There was also the dim yellow light coming from each, probably coming from the leading tip of the object, because the light was less visible once th! e objects passed overhead. The four objects were flying very near to one another in a flexible delta formation. The formation was like a small flock of birds imperfect and changing, but they were moving inexplicably quickly with no visible wings.  I noticed them just before they were directly overhead, and were out of sight and earshot within 10 seconds.  I was not able to discern the shape clearly, but my best guess would be rounded triangles, similar to the “flying wing” design of the F117 Nighthawk. They all appeared identical to one another. As they passed, the sounds diminished accordingly, and I quickly lost track of them in the night sky.  Both my friend and I were duly creeped out and went back inside immediately.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933

A long queue of whitish round orbs, perhaps 15 total, in the south covering the whole heavens.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-27 21:01:00;2 minutes;A long queue of whitish round orbs, perhaps 15 total, in the south covering the whole heavens, moving from West to East at steady speed In the Southern sky, I looked up and saw a long queue of uniform glowing orbs, all in all perhaps 15 of them, whitish, in even concourse, moving at a steady velocity. They spanned the entire sky. They entered the atmosphere from out of invisibility moving Easterly at regular intervals. They were evenly spaced except a few were less or more close/far one another. What a sight! When I spotted them, the procession was already begun. They made no sudden movements. The sky was clear. In the West, the waxing crescent Moon was about 20 degrees from Venus. The UFOs were in the South covering the whole of the heavens as tho a pearl necklace.  It wrapped me in sheer astonishment. Today is my birthday. I have been doing the most profound spiritual work of my life recently forming profound mental connections and relationships extraordinarily rare to wit, forming a walkable bridge through the syntax of ACIM (Holy Spirit) with Enochian Angelic Magic & Sacred Geometry & the Archetypal Mind (Tarot) & grasping the nature of time & timelessness as well as my own Christhood which I share with the world. Is it possible that this was a gift? I know these craft can shift their resonant frequency so that they become visible / invisible. I also was using a pyramid in meditation aligned to magnetic north and charged water using it. It was a discovery I want to share about creating structured water. I am not surprised today they appeared, of all days. For mt dedication is total and I believe I have overcome the world I but invite Christ now to be present-at-hand in the world thru my eyes, ears, hands, feet & voice. I am VERY ! curious if anyone else saw them. The timing of seeing them was highly personal. This was life changing. It's possible, empirically, they were satellites, but this seems highly unlikely.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
