While waiting for my child's soccer practice to end, I was shooting with a new HD CAM to get practice for a forthcoming project.  I was shooting some leaves in a tree and other things in the park. When I returned home and viewed the footage on my computer, I saw an anomaly.  Did not think much of it at the time.  I got more experience with the edit suite and came across the footage again recently and decided to slow it down and zoom it in.  The anomaly seems to have shape of a diamond and possibly a light in the middle.  Would like to have it analyzed, though.

Slow-moving diamond-shaped object slowly traverses Southern Buffalo NY sky and winks out.;2014-09-27 21:10:00;~5 minutes;Slow-moving diamond-shaped object slowly traverses Southern Buffalo NY sky and winks out. Live North of Buffalo, went outside for a cigarette, looking South. Saw object moving slowly East to West.  Lost it in the trees and it did not reappear in the proper amount of time had its speed been steady.  Continued at slower rate of speed once it reappeared and then stopped (hovering?) for 2+ minutes.  Lights dimmed and winked out in roughly 2-3 seconds. Object appeared as 5 lights in orientation to me they were top/bottom/left/right/center making a diamond shape. Lights were white with an orange-ish tint.  Orientation did not change as it moved. No aura, no trail, no haze. Sky was completely clear, light pollution was typical but negligible.  Took a picture with cellphone camera but it's garbage.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Very bright reddish orange color diamond shaped object.;2015-09-30 20:15:00;5 minutes;Very bright reddish orange color diamond shaped object. At approximately 23:15 my wife called me out to our screened porch and pointed south. Upon looking at the direction she was pointing to, I/we seen what appeared to be  a diamond shaped object about 3-4 thousand feet in the air traveling from northeast direction to the south west direction.   The object appeared to be emitting reddish orange color and traveling without any sound. It was traveling about the same speed as an aircraft would be approaching a runway several miles away (we have an airport about 5 miles away.)  As the object then faded  from our view and then disappeared,  An identical object came in from the northeast direction and travelled the same route with the same end results.   In closing, it was apparent that both objects remained at the same height throughout our viewing;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
