I made jestures in an attempt to scare them off when a light/for silver/white object caught my eye as it passed the roofline moving across the clear blue sky at an usually high rate of speed with no vapor trail and not any sound being emitted. At first I thought it might be a high flying bird like a seagull using the thermals, but when i saw the straight line and the distance it covered i just watched it go straight west to east until out of sight from a tree. I have never seen an object traveling at that speed and cover the distance in my life and i have no idea what it was, but if I had not been looking at the roofline of the house i would never have dectected it otherwise on such a clear and bright day.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Two red lights (about the width of the pink finger held away from the body) in the sky almost directly moving at a very fast rate.;2007-03-23 23:40:00;less than 3 seconds;Two red lights (about the width of the pink finger held away from the body) in the sky almost directly moving at a very fast rate. Basically, I was just stargazing this night instead of using the telescope.  Orion was well to the west and setting and Gemini was in the southwest and Saturn was SSW to the right of the constellation Leo.  The condition was clear for a change and I was noting the light pollution due to an article I recently read in Sky & Telescope. Just as I was gazing near Castor and Pollux a pair of red lights set evenly apart was moving at a very fast rate from those star locations towards the east.  There was no noise.  The width these light were apart was just about the width of a finger held at arms length away from the body.  The lights remained evenly apart the whole duration.  I could not determine any kind of shape between or around the lights or if it was one or two objects. The only aircraft that was near was a plane coming from the NNE and headed south towards Buffalo and that made a definite noise.  About 12:15 or so I went inside to consult the NASA http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/tracking/ website to verify where the ISS was located, which was New Zealand at the time. The only thing I can conclude it was too fast to be a normal passenger aircraft and not quite a communication, ISS or other satellite and I have witnessed the ISS before.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Unknown silent, lighted craft hovered overhead, Buffalo NY;2011-05-28 21:55:00;4 minutes;Unknown silent, lighted craft hovered overhead, Buffalo NY A craft of unknown shape and size, at an altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 ft. approached from the east, making no noise, and emitting an intense red glow, with yellowish back-lighting.  The craft initially maintained a straight forward motion and consistent speed (although it was much slower than a jet plane). As the craft approached the apex of the sky above me, slightly to my north, it slowed even further, it came to a complete stop, and hovered in that position for about a half minute. then it appeared to lift straight upward at a high rate of speed, still silent, as it lifted away, the lights became smaller and dimmer, until it was no longer visible. The sky conditions where partly cloudy, and I did see jet plane traffic overhead at their normal 30+ thousand feet.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
6 orange reddish, flashing lights,  slowly coming off the horizon joining in formation;2012-09-29 20:30:00;3-5 minutes;6 orange reddish, flashing lights,  slowly coming off the horizon joining in formation 	Last night at about 8:30 p.m. is when the event took place. However let me start by saying  the original object I observed has been in the sky for months. I first spotted it in March, looks like a bright star, only its strobing and blinking different colors. I grabbed my friends cheap telescope,  got it in view, and once the object was in focus, I was shocked to see it was 4 lights in a straight line, evenly spaced(also nothing was flashing, as appose to out of focus). I was very surprised and exited, as I’m very into this type of thing, and always wanted to personally witness something. This got me very interested in this “star” , and anytime I’d be outside at night I’d look for it. As said, I’ve observed it for months now parked in the same spot moving across the sky with the rest of the stars, like nothing irregular(other than the strobing lights) and was there the whole time until yesterday.  Sorry for the little pre -story but I felt it was necessary  	So last night around 8:15 I started walking to my buddy’s house to hang out, and as always when I’m walking, I look for my star. I take a look at it in the gaps between trees and houses.  As I’m nearing my friends house I see there’s now 2 of the strobing stars next to each other.  This other one hasn’t been there any other time I look. As I get to another gap where I can see the objects again, I notice they are now spaced farther apart. I’m all worked up now, and go sprinting to my friends house, I really didn’t want to be the only one to see this.  My friend wasn’t home right then so I grabbed his neighbor to come out.  Now there were three of these lights, flashing and pulsating an orangish reddish glow, all in a misshapen triangle form, with another one of the lights drifting up from the horizon to join the other three.  Then there was a smaller triangular formation that looked almost identical in formation just smaller, slowly drift up from the horizon.  At this point it was! me, my friends neighbor, and his wife and daughter. 	Just then  my friend pulled in his house, and my other friend who lives up the street came down, and then we had my 2 friends, and my friends mom and sister come look. At this point is when the objects started slowly dissipating. The lower, smaller triangle formation all dimmed slowly until they were gone, then what was left was the larger triangle formation. However now they were equidistant from each other, in a symmetrical  triangle until they all slowly dimmed out. What I thought was interesting, was the fact that atleast the one light, I’ve observed for months, and the fact that last night I just watched this happen and now that light is gone, it‘s truly an awesome experience. A few details I forgot to put in, was that it was quite cloudy, and no stars we’re visible, these were the only visible lights in the sky. And the movement of the objects was all very slow, they slowly came up and they slowly disappeared. Hoping that others have seen this, maybe even got video, I! know my friends mom and nieghbor got a few pictures  towards the end of it all, but a video would really be nice.

I saw a yellow-orange, spherical glowing light in the early evening sky, moving horizontally at first and then changing direction.;2013-07-18 21:30:00;20-30 seconds;I saw a yellow-orange, spherical glowing light in the early evening sky, moving horizontally at first and then changing direction Tonight around 9:30 p.m. Eastern Time, I was observing the moon which was in the southern sky.  Then I happened to notice a glowing light in the eastern sky, approx. 20 degrees up from the horizon.  The sky was dark and rather hazy from clouds and I did not see a craft it was just the light that I saw.  I did not hear any sound.  The light was spherical or oval shaped, yellow-orange in color, and it moved horizontally at first (from south to north).   Next, it changed direction - appearing to go up and down slightly, and it shifted toward the south a bit.  Finally it appeared to move toward the north and east, and the glowing began to fade (became seemingly smaller) to what looked like a tiny dot, possibly orange or red.  eventually the light disappeared from my view.   The total elapsed time of my viewing was approximately 20-30 seconds. This was the first time I have ever seen such a thing.  The light didn't seem to be coming from an airplane, nor from a helicopter.  I am a male in my early fifties.   My daughter, age 6, was with me and asked me if it was an alien spaceship.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Hovering bright white light surrounded by pulsating green and red lights.;2015-01-22 21:30:00;15-30 minutes;Hovering bright white light surrounded by pulsating green and red lights Seen from 4th floor of Tri Main Center Buffalo, NY.   Looking west I saw the Lake Erie Lights  From about 21:30 to 22:00 hours.  There were two sets of lights.  Each individual set was a bright white light centered within (two?) red and green lights.  The red and green lights were pulsating like emergency vehicle lights.  They were not blinking lights.  There were not aircraft.  They hovered or slightly drifted for about 15-30 mins.   The one set of lights moved gradually to one side of my vision and then disappeared.  I don't think it moved into cloud cover.  There was very little cloud cover if any last night.   I did not have a camera.  The reports of these lights is that they repeat on numerous nights in a row.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
Mass ufo arrival and aggregation over Buffalo NY.;2020-06-07 18:40:00;30+ minutes;Mass ufo arrival and aggregation over Buffalo NY. Hi.  My name is Deirdre Nelson (Caprix 1969 on youtube).  Whenever weather permits, I film ufos or stars that are not stars, in the sky in front of my house.  Today, I filmed a mass sighting.  I’ve never seen this many up until this point.  Reviewing the video, I think I may see some kind of wormholes in the form of misshapen, tunneling ringed ovals.  They seemed to be mostly coming from those areas of the sky.  Bright, mostly oval or round as well as a few grey almond shaped crafts.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W_xn22MJDg;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
