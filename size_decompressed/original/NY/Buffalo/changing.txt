Kite shaped object  bright white, above deleware park;2010-10-05 19:34:00;3-4 minutes;Kite shaped object  bright white, above deleware park Driving Along the 33 expressway, I saw what could be described as a kite flying in the air but much larger, higher and lite up.  It was above albright knox art gallery, and as a sky watcher i know it was not a helicopter or plane. it went from where i first noticed it, down almost below tree line back up, stayed stationery for aprox 30 sec and then up higher away and out of sight,  Totally threw me for a loop, there were other cars on 33 that were slowing down behind and in front of me, i know someone else saw what i saw,;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933

Quick sighting of a strange object flying through the air, accompanied with a loud sound and strange energy.;2020-12-07 04:45:00;Less than 1 minute;Quick sighting of a strange object flying through the air, accompanied with a loud sound and strange energy. I was laying in bed, late into the morning. All of a sudden I notice this strange noise. At first it was faint and I didn’t think much of it, it sounded like some sort of aircraft, but oddly unique. At first I didn’t think much of it but it kept getting louder and more intense. I could sense something coming closer. As the sound got louder I felt an odd presence or energy. It got so loud and strange that I turned around and looked out my window. As I turn around I see a cylinder shaped object whip by my window, it seemed so close to the ground. It was moving so fast that I couldn’t get a good look at it. I was opening my window as I was looking I saw red lights blinking and it left a bit of a trail. I eventually stuck my head out the window and saw off in the distance a cone shaped aircraft with a red light blinking at the top moving quickly into the distance. I didn’t get a great look at it, but it all felt so strange.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
