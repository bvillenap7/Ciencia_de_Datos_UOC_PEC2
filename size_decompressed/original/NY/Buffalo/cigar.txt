Everyone saw this thing, including The Buffalo Police.  ((anonymous report));1977-08-13 21:00:00;10-15 minutes;Everyone saw this thing, including The Buffalo Police I remember this like it was yesterday. My parents had taken us for ice cream followed by a trip to the waterfront to get a breeze off the lake.  It was something we did quite a bit in the summer because of the hot humid Buffalo summers and we didn't have AC then . Well, as we were driving in Our station wagon , all 8 of us . While on Tifft St. headed towards the lake, my mother and father pointed out something strange in the sky.  It was shape like a cigar and had multiple colors revolving on it.  It was silent and slowly moving in an odd diagnol manner, side to side, up and down . Thing was very bright and hovered as well from time to time.  It scared to hell out of everyone in the car.  I remember how loud and frantic us kids got. It was there for what it felt like was forever.  People were pulled over and out of their cars watching.  There were Buffalo Policemen doing the same.  People came out of local businesses and their homes to watch this thing.  It was a mass sighting!  Then in an instant it went left then it went right on an upward angle a it was gone in an instant.  People in the neighborhood talked about this for years.  Nothing ever came about it.  It was just one of those things that happened in our neighbor hood.   My brother and I talk about it occasionally and we were discussing it at work one day and another guy overheard us and he said remembers seeing it too.  This was at least 20 + yrs later.  We consider ourselves extremely lucky for witnessing this UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

It appeared as if it was a bright light, though some how we could tell that it was in fact reflecting light more than any other object we have ever seen.  I saw it first and pointed it out to my friend saying, is that a UFO, and he responded that he too thought it was a UFO.   The craft then moved swiftly to the right, the movement was swift and odd to watch as it did not move like any other air craft we had ever seen. It then came to a complete stop, then it backed away until it disappeared into the sky. It was the most incredible thing I have ever seen.  I no longer question the existance of UFO sightings.;42.9039239975215;-78.8517997422933
