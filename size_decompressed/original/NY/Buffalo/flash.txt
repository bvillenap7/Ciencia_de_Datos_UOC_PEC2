My 2 friends and I saw them at first and thought it was a plane, but then we see the lights flashing slowly and extremely bright.  Then we saw another.   It would randomly move location after a few flashes maybe 20 seconds apart. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
