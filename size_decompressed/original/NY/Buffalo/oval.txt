What basically happened was 2 of my friends and I were playing football in my front yard. We saw this oval shaped object in the sky with two spotlight like lights coming out of the bottom.  One was yellow and the other was red.  The thing about these lights was that they stopped in mid-air perfectly, probably around 20 feet from the UFO. When it was overhead from us, we all recall this very strange feeling.  Then it vanished or accelerated extremely fast and speed off. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Bright, oval shape flew silently through lower branches of trees after dark, west-east direction.;2017-07-31 22:00:00;2 seconds;Bright, oval shape flew silently through lower branches of trees after dark, west-east direction. Buffalo, NY    7/31/17  Sometime between 9-11 pm, while sitting in my backyard, I saw a low flying oval shape for a split second, flying through lower branches of trees in my yard, moving in a west easterly direction.  I believe it was bright green in the front and bright white in the back, about the size of a football and completely silent.  I have never seen anything like this in my life. Background of observer:  62 year old woman, Masters Degree in Psychology.  Worked for State of NY for 31 years. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she seemed to us to be both quite sincere, and sober-minded.  She reports that the object was back-dropped by the nearby trees, and not just against the nighttime sky.  Hence, she was able to deduce that the object was fairly close to her position.
