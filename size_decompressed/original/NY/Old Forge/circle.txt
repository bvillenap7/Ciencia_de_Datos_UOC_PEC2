I saw a round base with 4 flashing lights on it (red and yellow).  The craft was at low altitude and it was moving faster than any aircraft I'd ever seen.  I saw the same thing about a 1/2 hour later but it was higher.;43.7405;-74.8898

A few seconds later my son cried out, What is that?.  Looking up into the sky I saw a circular object with 6 lights near the edge.  As I recall there were 2 red lights near the front, 2 white lights near the middle and 2 green lights near the back.  The craft was moving from east to west and I was facing north. The craft appeared to be white or silver and was maybe 400-500 feet above us (guesstimate).  The craft was moving at a steady pace/quickly across the sky.  I was baffled as to what the object was and went to get my sister.  The same type of craft was seen again at approx. 21:45 but at a higher altitude.;43.7405;-74.8898
