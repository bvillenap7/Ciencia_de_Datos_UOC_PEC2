I figured it was a unique opportunity to look up and see no man-made lights considering all planes were supposedly grounded due to the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.   I live in the country and so our sky is very dark.  I was looking northwest (10 o’clock) when I saw a steady, non-blinking, blue-white light, like a very large star, moving across the sky northward.  It had no tail so I don‘t believe it was a comet or flare.  The bright star-like object was proceeding at a rate much quicker than any jet I had ever seen. The light then stopped moving (1 o’clock).  It hovered and did not move for about half a minute.  Then it quickly soared OUT!  Not north, south, east or west, but out - as in towards the heavens. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed the International Space Station.  Her description is not inconsistent with that possibility, we believe.  PD));42.6132;-74.1429
