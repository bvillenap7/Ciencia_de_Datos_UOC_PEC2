it came after me and my dog, i was walking him that night;1998-03-27 23:00:00;15min;it came after me and my dog, i was walking him that night Hi my name is Jason and i'am 16 years old.  Tonight 11:30pm. {3/27/98} I was walking my dog in my development {New York, in clifton park, 30 min north of Albany} when i noticed a bright yellow light.  At first iI thought it was a airplane but then it moved from side to side and then it got as small as a star then it got bigger again.  it started to move away so i walked down to the end of the street to get a better look at it.  The light started to get bigger and bigger and i started to make out the shape of what it looked like.  As it got closer to me i started to run away.  It was shining 4 or 5 spot lights around were i was but just for about 3 sec. then it was following me and then it crossed {behinde me which was the road i was standing on} it looked like a top hat but all the coners were cut of like if u take a square and off a coner of it, and it had just to lines for the door going from the bottom of it to the top.  It also had little windows around the whole thing.  As i looked at it as i was running it was coming down on a angle.  it was about a 100 feet from the tree tops. It had lights all around the whole ship and one on the top of the ship. As it got closer it had a mist of the color cyan around it.  As I ran back to my house with my dog i noticed i couldn't see it anymore because the trees were in the way.  When i got back to my house I told my dad what happened.  We went looking outside my dad saw the bright yellow light in the distance and it was heading north then dissapeared.  I have attached a picture that i have drawn of what i saw.  I would like to know if u had any pictures that looked like this one and if there was any other ufo sightings in that areaaround that time.  Thank you for your time;42.8482000000003;-73.7862999999998
5-6 bright orange lights in formation across the sky.;2014-08-13 21:10:00;5 minutes;5-6 bright orange lights in formation across the sky. Myself and 2 strangers noticed 5-6 very bright orange dots flying across the night sky in formation.  It seemed that the objects had the orange light on the front of the crafts.  When they turned the light faded away.  There was no sound at all.  They were flying much lower than most airplanes fly here and about the same distance away from the ground as helicopters fly.  One of the strangers took a photo of the craft and in the picture it looked like orange boomerangs. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
