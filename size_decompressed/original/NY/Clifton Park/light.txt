Very bright light in sky, enveloped by blackness, then it and the blackness were gone.;2015-12-03 18:05:00;30 seconds;Very bright light in sky, enveloped by blackness, then it and the blackness were gone. Driving north on RT146A at approximately 18:05 saw a very bright light that was hovering in the sky then a blackness began behind it from my point of vision which grew to a size larger than the light then the light moved into the blackness and could no longer be seen and then the blackness grew smaller and smaller until it was gone.;42.8482000000003;-73.7862999999998
