They were very bright yellowish orange color.  They were below the height of a normal airplane and some what near to what a helicopter would fly.  They went out of sight after about 10 mins.  They did not make any sound.;42.8482000000003;-73.7862999999998

Witnessed for about 2 min I was standing out on my driveway at approx 9pm on Sept. 13 when I witnessed an orange light (almost looked like a fireball) moving slowly across the sky.  I yelled to get my brother who also seen it.  As he ran in to get my parents another orange light followed closely behind in the same direction. Both objects were slow moving and almost pulsing getting brighter then dimmer.  I would compare them to a meteor but no tail and moving much to slow.  We continued to watch for approx 2 min. until they just disappeared.  I attempted to video, but my hands were shaking and i couldn't get my phone to record.  There was an overcast so these objects were below the cloud cover so they weren't to far up.  These were very bright and no sound we could here.  By far the strangest thing I have ever seen.;42.8482000000003;-73.7862999999998
