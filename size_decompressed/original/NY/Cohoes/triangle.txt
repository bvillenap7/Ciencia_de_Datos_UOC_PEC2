2 Ufo's on Google Moon (incredible detail);2011-03-01 13:00:00;ongoing;2 Ufo's on Google Moon (incredible detail) I was recently checking out Google Earth Moon, and came across an interesting object.  It appears to be a craft that kind of looks like a beetle?  I measured it at more than 1/2 a mile long and 1/4 mile wide at the wings.  It's also 300' tall.  This object has swept back features and appears to be aerodynamic. I realized this was a manufactured vehicle so I searched for more.  I found an identical vehicle approx 800 miles away.  Both vehicles have huge hooks in the front with two small prongs sticking out underneath.  The hooks are over 500' long, I believe I found more items close to the object that indicate a mining operation.  This is the most compelling evidence I've ever seen!!
