We were about 5 minutes away from home, I was in the passenger seat, and all of sudden i saw this glowing red orb/fireball come flying from south west, going above our car and continuing north.  I had my wife pull over, and we both got out of the car.  I quickly took my iphone and captured a video, and took a picture with it.  I do not believe this was a Chinese lantern or anthing similar to that.  In the picture, even though it was with iphone, you can see the shape of the object and tell there was a energy field around it.  The video is not the greatest, but you can see the pattern of its flight path, straight across like a craft flying, not flying high into the sky like a balloon rising.;42.7730000000001;-73.7111000000003
