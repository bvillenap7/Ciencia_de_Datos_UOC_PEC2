The sky was a deep blue with absolutely no clouds.  My father happened to look up and saw this strange object moving across the sky (much faster than any aircraft) both myself and husband also saw this.  We were all standing facing east with the sun in front of us at almost eye level.  Within aprox. 10 secs. we all saw another one coming from the north....crossing the path of the sun and continuing south and out of sight.  Three or four more continued in the same pattern at about the same intrevals. The last sighting was 3 circle shapes following one another and when they past the sun turned into a triangle shape and continued toward the south and out of sight.  My husband said that he also saw one circle that was stationary ( above ) the sun during this time. I myself did not see this one.  No vapor trail was ever seen. No sounds.  No other aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally credible.  We have requested reports from the other three adult witnesses.  PD));43.4393999999998;-76.4613
There was a circular UFO with lights traveling around it.;2005-11-10 23:54:00;0:00;There was a circular UFO with lights traveling around it. There was a small flashing light that looked like a flashing star.  It had a greenish-blue tint to it.  The light seemed stationary.  When you looked at it closely it looked like there were lights that were circuling around a round object rather than lights that were flashing.  The light ended up disappearing after about 6 minutes.;43.4393999999998;-76.4613
3 UFO’s caught on video;2021-02-06 21:45:00;1.15 minutes;3 UFO’s caught on video It was a clear, very cold night. At first we thought it was a very fast moving airplane, until we watched it move in fast sporadic directions. The craft was silent, round/oval,  appeared to somewhat change shapes, and colors. Red, yellow, orange, blue lights glowing in and out. We did not notice the other two craft zoom in and around the first craft until we played back the video. Yes, we caught this on a video camera on my iPhone. The video is 1:15 min in duration. After returning inside the camper, my phone and another persons phone nearby, were acting strange screen jumping, not connecting. I was trying to find this site, phone wouldn’t connect. I then decided to call 911, which I called 2-3 times before it finally connected. I’d like to send in our video for you to look at.;43.4393999999998;-76.4613
