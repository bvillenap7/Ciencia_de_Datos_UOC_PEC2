A triangular object with three bright orange lights travelled across the sky heading North.;2013-03-16 20:15:00;10 seconds;A triangular object with three bright orange lights travelled across the sky heading North An object crossed the sky going North.  The object was triangular in shape and had three bright orange fiery lights.  The light source was large...definitely not a point source like a light bulb that you would see on a normal aircraft.  There were no other lights on the craft.  It moved across the sky at a fairly fast speed with one light in the front and the other two behind in a triangular shape.  The object was also fairly large, though it is dificult to say how large not knowing what it's elevation was.  To estimate it was about the size of an F-14 at about a thousand feet.  As the object moved acroos the sky it was completely silent.;43.4393999999998;-76.4613
