Brilliant slow moving light in fayetteville ny.;2013-10-11 21:00:00;90 seconds;Brilliant slow moving light in fayetteville ny It started as a brilliant white, slow moving light.  No sound.  As it travelled in a northwestern direction, this whit light changed to pink.  It appeared to have a point on it.  It seemed to waver as it moved, as if it hung from a string.  No blinking lights.... As it got further away, the light dimmed, then disappeared.  Though, not behind clouds. It was not not far enough away to just disappear.  Nor was it very high in the air. This is not the first time we'd seen this.  Over the summer, we saw the same thing, traveling in the same direction, doing the exact same thing.  Though we attempted to follow it by car.
