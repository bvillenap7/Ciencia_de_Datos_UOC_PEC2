Newark, NY, solid dark sphere with orange/red light on front.;2019-07-06 20:00:00;15 minutes;Newark, NY, solid dark sphere with orange/red light on front. We watched a dark ball shaped craft with a single steady orange/red light on front approach us while boating on the Erie Canal in Newark, NY.  I shined a bright flashlight at it and it turned back the way it came.  No noise, no wings, no anti collision lights.   It flew about 1000 feet in the air.  It maintained the same speed and height for the duration we could see it.  It flew as close as a quarter mile from us before turning back.;43.0475;-77.0939999999998
