The last 2 triangular objects in the formation crossed over to each others positions numerous times. The sky was clear and dark with visable stars.  I also viewed at the same time, high altitude aircraft.  Earlier in the evening (approx. 15-30 minutes prior) I observed a falling star in the same vicinity.  The color of the triangular objects were light orange, and they were steady colored...not flashing or flickering.  No sound was heard.  The entire sighting lasted approximately 15 seconds.;42.1221;-79.1906
