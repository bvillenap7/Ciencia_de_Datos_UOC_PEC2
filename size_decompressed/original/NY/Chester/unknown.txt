Through binoculars it appeared high in the sky as we could see birds which appeared to be at the same height much clearer.  It was an indeterminate color and either possessed it own source of light or was reflecting light from the sun, i.e. it appeared to glow brighter and dimmer.  Although moving slowly, and at times changing course it was hard to keep a bead on it.   During my best visual of this object it appeared to be separate round balls of light.  It also had what looked like a black line trailing at the bottom.  My guess is that it might be a released bunch of silver Mylar balloons, the black line, however was not wavy as a string for balloons would be suspended in air.  The day here in NY is calm and sunny and at last sighting the object was headed in a north westerly direction. I would appreciate knowing if anyone else has seen this thing.
