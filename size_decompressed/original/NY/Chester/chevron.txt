6  chevron shaped objects seen in the daytime sky doing loop-de-loops at high altitude;1978-07-01 14:00:00;1-2 minutes;6  chevron shaped objects seen in the daytime sky doing loop-de-loops at high altitude I was around 15 years old at the time (very good eye vision at the time too), and was riding my dirt bike. I stopped on a hill by the town's water tower to take a look at the town below. It was a clear day, with a brilliant blue sky. I glanzed upward and noticed what i thought were birds flying in single file. I did a double take, and realized these objects were manufactured, but were following each other in loop-de-loop motions.  They were confined to a small area of the sky (about 80 degrees from horizon in NE sky). 6 of them were triangle in shape and took on the appearance  of silver, kind of like a Jet at a high altitude on a cold day.   As they did a loop , they disappeared out of sight.I could only figure they were going in & out of our atmosphere.  Only did this for a minute or two , then they vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.353;-74.2627000000001
