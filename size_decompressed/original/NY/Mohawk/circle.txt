At about 7:30pm I was observing a hawk flying when I inadvertently caught glimpse of a UFO, steadily flying in a straight line. With it having no vapor trail, no blinking lights like a normal plane or anything...I watched it travel in a straight line for about a minute, then it flashed an extremely bright white light all around it and it was gone.;42.99;-74.9853
Orange circle shaped light hovered and then moved across sky;2016-07-29 09:15:00;90 seconds;Orange circle shaped light hovered and then moved across sky My husband and I went out for a walk in our neighborhood.  I always look up into the sky and star gaze and as I did this I saw a bright orange circle coming toward us.  It was about the size of a low flying plane but was completely circular, bright orange like fire, and silent. I said, look a ufo!  My husband said what is that?!.  Then it stopped and hovered right in our line of vision. My husband kept trying to come up with explanations for what it was.  A Chinese lantern, drone.  But it wasnt. It had stopped!  It was early, only about 9:15, so we could see people in their houses and I wanted to call to them to come see the ufo!  After watching it for about a minute it moved in a different direction from how it was traveling before, to the right and traveled across the sky into the clouds out of site. I have no doubt what we saw was the real thing.  My husband is a huge skeptic and he said now he is a believer!  The whole time we witnessed this I kept saying, see I told you!  It's a ufo! They're here!;42.99;-74.9853
