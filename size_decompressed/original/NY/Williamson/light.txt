At 2147 hrs. on June 21, 2014, I observed what appeared to be a lit object with no blinking lights at an altitude lower than many commercial airlines normally fly at.   It was brighter than any “satelites” I normally see in the night sky.  It was heading in a straight East-South east path.;43.2108;-77.1498
Seen a light go across the sky higher than a plane would be in a faster pace and seen two more about 15 min later heard no sound;2017-09-09 09:00:00;45 sec;Seen a light go across the sky higher than a plane would be in a faster pace, and seen two more about 15 min later heard no sound;43.2108;-77.1498
