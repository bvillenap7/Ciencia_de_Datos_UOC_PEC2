Object repoted on 8/31/04 on your website    ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.  PD));2004-08-31 21:15:00;25 minutes;Object repoted on 8/31/04 on your website While trying out a new telescope last night I witnessed the same object. At first I thought it to be deep space. I viewed it through a lens with 78x power and it looked nebulous ,rather cloud like. I went in to get binoculars and it apparantly moved Eastward quite quickly and had lost much of its shape. The Moon was rising and I figured it was only a cloud reflecting Moonlight. I told my wife about it and said at first I thought I'd spotted some thing strange in the heavens but felt foolish as I factored in the Moon. Guess I did see something .
