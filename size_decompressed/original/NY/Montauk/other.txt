I awoke as if it was timed very strange my eyes opened i was completly aware of where i was in the house and alone and looking outside. There was a shape with 6 to 7 lights (round) moving in a couterclockwise motion from left to right,  The movement was like like looking at a clock face meaning i could always see the lights moving first in the circle than travelling as one to the right and moving in a circle and than travelling together to the left moving in a circle first before it travelled.d I kept my eyes on it and then it dissolved.  The color of the lights was bright white. It wasn't a craft in that you could make out a 3 dimensioanl form it was just there like a presence but the lights never moved out of their shape  The closest shape i can think of was like the shape of a sacrum (the body) not quite a an upside down triangle but more rounded. .  After it dissolved i did feel a kind of gravitation to and from in my body but not feeling anykind of abduction or that i was in danger. The yard next door has  swimming pool and a large deck around it. When it was light enough outside i looked down on the deck and saw what appeared to be 6 or 7 round circles in almost the same formation of the lights i saw.  I am a Movement therapist did graduate study in Movement analysis movement observation. This is the first time i have experienced this.;41.0468;-71.9396
