Cloudless night sky.  2 observers saw fast moving triangle/boomerang shaped lights travel in a Northwest direction.  The lights were resembled the effect a strong searchlight would make on an overcast night sky, but there were no clouds, no haze and no smog and there was no light beam as there would have been if we had been observing a searchlight.  There was no noise.  Their speed seemed faster than any low flying conventional aircraft could possibly attain.  We were in a sparsely populated point of land that extends into the Atlantic Ocean and there were no known nearby cars or headlights.;41.0468;-71.9396
