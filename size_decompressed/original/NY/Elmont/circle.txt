Orange lights seen in Elmont, Long Island, New York;2012-09-09 20:10:00;10 minutes;Orange lights seen in Elmont, Long Island, New York On September 9, 2012 at about 8:10pm, my wife and I were in Elmont, Long Island, driving east on Hempstead Turnpike near the corner of Covert Avenue when we saw approximately 12 lights in the sky east of our car.  The lights were circular in shape and orange, and about 3 times larger than a star.   The lights were aligned roughly in a vertical formation and moved very slowly as they hovered in the sky.  A couple of the lights moved in a semi-circular motion.  Unlike an airplane or helicopter, which can be traced in the sky as they move out of view, these lights seemed to disappear from view. We watched the lights for about 10 minutes until they all disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness on two occasions, and we found him to be exceptionally eloquent and objective in the description of the objects he and his wife witnessed.  He described the event as a life-changing event.  Both husband and wife have jobs that require unusual talent and training.  PD));40.6981;-73.7044999999999
Perfectly still golden orb in the sky for a long duration over Long Island.;2020-06-29 04:00:00;1.5 hours;Perfectly still golden orb in the sky for a long duration over Long Island. A single golden colored, circular UFO was perfectly still, relatively low in the sky.  I have never seen something stay so still and so low in the sky before.  The sky was fairly overcast and the object was visible underneath the clouds, so it was not a star or planet.  I kept checking back every 10-15 mins and it still remained in the sky.  The sun rose right at its location and it was still visible.  Never seen anything like it!;40.6981;-73.7044999999999
