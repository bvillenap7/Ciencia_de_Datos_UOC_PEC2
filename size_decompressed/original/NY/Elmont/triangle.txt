(planes pass by all the time but this was in a different direction. they usually fly east/west but this was flying n/s) i went out side and i saw 3 things. 1 was too far away for me to identify, another was a comercial plane (flying the same way as trianlge), and a black triangle with no lights. It was no millitary aircraft i had ever seen. it looked a star destroyer from star wars but it was black. it was going extremely fast, it elevated and flew over the plane, and then sped away. (many other black triangles made no sound this is why i find this odd);40.6981;-73.7044999999999

Lights change pattern so triangle appears to get bigger and smaller at some points.  Sometimes 1 or 2 lights may be on and the other completely off.  Sometimes only one light will be lit.  At another point it seems there was a 4th and 5th light they went away after about 3 mins. I took a number of pictures. Object dwarves planes flying in the sky.  Very intimidating even out the window of my room.;40.6981;-73.7044999999999
