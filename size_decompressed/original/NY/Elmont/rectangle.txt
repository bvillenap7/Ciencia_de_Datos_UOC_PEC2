A memory I will never forget that happened meny years ago.;1978-10-10 02:00:00;5min;A memory I will never forget that happened meny years ago. I saw this object many years ago.  I still remember the details like it was yesterday.   It was a long ship like the size of a football field.  It was also tall like 30 or 40 feet tall.  It had windows from top to bottom.  I could see inside there were people walking around.  It was about 600 ft away from me.  I was driving in a car with my friend.  I was in the front passanger seat.  I asked her to stop the car so she could see what I was talking about.  She was denying my claims.  I was shouting to her to stop the car but she wouldn't.  She seemed like she was in a trance.  I still remember this as if it were yesterday.;40.6981;-73.7044999999999
