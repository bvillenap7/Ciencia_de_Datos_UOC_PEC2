Solid white lights over Hicksville NY;2009-09-09 20:10:00;1 min;Solid white lights over Hicksville NY I live in a high aircraft area (JFK,LAG,Newark airports surround me)At 20:10 hours My Girlfriend & I witnessed Two solid white lights traveling west to east over Hicksville NY. In the area were Airplanes with the usual flashing beacon lights on them most were flying in a southwest to northeast direction, when these two solid white lights appeared following eachother below the cloud cover. At first I thought they may have been satellites but they were below the cloud cover & even below where the other aircrafts were flying. They were round soild white lights. Im sure the aircraft in the area had to see them! As they went out of view in the eastern sky they stayed bright, & I'd say they were traveling at about the same speed as other aircraft in the area. I spent 4 years in the Air force & know the difference between Airplanes & UFO's.;40.761304854369;-73.5308058252428
2 disk shaped objects with rapidly changing colors from blue purple and green.;2011-12-18 22:05:00;3 hours or more;2 disk shaped objects with rapidly changing colors from blue purple and green. I was looking out my window randomly and had noticed what almost looked like a star but was changing color rapidly which was green blue purple.  I than realized there was another one doing the same exact thing next to it but a little  further away.  This is not the first time i've seen these objects and there's usually at least 2 or 3. I took out binoculars and went into my backyard to get a better look and it looked like it was a disk shape and those lights were around the outside of both the objects.  I noticed them at 10pm and they still have not left. The lights are always changing but every now and then they change more rapidly than at other times. These objects haven't moved from where they have been.  THEY ARE NOT PLANES!  I have tried to get pictures of these objects but they are too far away and too high up for my phone to get a clear picture of them. Thank you for your time for reading this.;40.761304854369;-73.5308058252428
Two bright lights moving smoothly with fast speed and no sound curving out of sight.;2012-01-01 21:00:00;20-30 seconds;Two bright lights moving smoothly with fast speed and no sound curving out of sight. My boyfriend was driving our car home, while i was in the front passenger seat.  We live in a suburban town with houses close together.  We were driving slow at about 25 mph.  Our direction was south on my block. At about 9pm eastern standard time, we witnessed two off-white lights flying from a south west direction.  The movement was smooth and VERY fast. The two lights were either connected or one was following the first with a small space between which never grew or shrunk (parallel). It is also possible one light was chasing the first. The size was about five times that of the stars we can see in the sky but they were much lower than airplanes..  It was cloudy out because of rain, but these lights were below the clouds. The lights moved so fast with no sound (we even opened the window to get a better look and hear for sound). The lights flew very fast from the south west in a smooth curve going east and then appeared to be moving downward. The movement was so fast and unfamiliar from that of an airplane.  From our view the object was moving to the right.  We could see the object move until it went below the houses on the block.  It then went out of sight.;40.761304854369;-73.5308058252428
White round light with a trail shoots down and disappears;2012-11-17 01:00:00;3 seconds;White round light with a trail shoots down and disappears Driving in a vehicle, I just happened to look up in the sky as a round-shaped light appeared out of nowhere, quite close to the horizon, but too high to be a part of any building or structural feature. The light disappeared as quickly as it appeared, shooting downward, in a horizontal direction. The UFO did leave a trail behind, and disappeared into the horizon, as if it landed somewhere. I have witnessed this once before a few months back in Long Beach, NY. There, it was as if it landed into a body of water.

There were three balls of white light flying around each other and flickering in and out and changing shape.;2016-10-07 17:30:00;20 minutes;There were three balls of white light flying around each other and flickering in and out and changing shape. I was driving home and saw three round balls of light flying around each other in circles, and also flickering in and out of the sky (western sky) while waiting at a traffic light.   I videoed one of them by zooming up on it with my iphone.  The object changed shapes while I was videoing it and then it got larger and sped up and flew away.   As I continued to drive home, I saw a trail like you would see coming out of the back of a jet moving at a very fast speed but there was no plane or anything else at the beginning of it (also in the western sky).  The trail stopped abruptly and a ball of light came out of it and then disappeared.  Both of these events happened in the same area of the sky looking west just south of Manhattan.;40.761304854369;-73.5308058252428
