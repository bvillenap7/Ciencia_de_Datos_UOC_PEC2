Black oval shaped object above Hicksville, NY.;2010-03-05 17:20:00;90 seconds;Black oval shaped object above Hicksville, NY. Sighted above public park, too far away to see clearly, oval shaped craft with fins located on sides and the top.  Visible until disappearing over clouds.  Black colored, far above air traffic, as compared to a near plane passing beneath the object, which was about 50,000 feet up.  At first seemed like an illusion, although clearly seen by 3 people.  Not much aerial activity, was going in a straight path.  One object was sighted during that time.  All three decided the object was not a plane, the object made no noise.  Was not a bird, no visible flapping of wings, and no birds around here fly that high besides the occasional hawk, but any hawk's migration pattern does not travel through the area except in summer.;40.761304854369;-73.5308058252428
