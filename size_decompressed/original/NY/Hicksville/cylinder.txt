Fast flying UFO with no wings and two halo lights spotted on long island.;2012-01-01 21:00:00;25 seconds;Fast flying UFO with no wings and two halo lights spotted on long island. Sunday, January 1st 2012 at around 21:00 hrs., driving south east on Sleepy Lane, Hicksville NY, my girlfriend quickly got my attention when yelling Oh my god look! as she pointed straight  ahead in the sky.  I saw along, skinny cylindrical shaped object with no wings, and two glowing halo lights. It appeared to be white in color, it flew from southwest past my front view, going a speed I have never, never seen before in my whole life.  It quickly made smooth fast flowing cuts in the air heading east. I saw this object while driving and it was in sight for about 20-25 seconds. I couldn't tell if the object was one piece or two separate aircrafts following one another. I have been living in Hicksville NY for almost 23 years now, and we are located between a few airports. I have seen a lot of airplanes come and go flying low above my home. These planes make their presence known by not only their flashing lights, but also by the loud roar they make. The aircraft I spotted in front of me while traveling south east on Sleepy Lane was not only visible on a cloudy rainy night, which means it was probably flying below the clouds...but it also made NO noise whatsoever. After it curved, it disappeared out of sight in the east.;40.761304854369;-73.5308058252428
