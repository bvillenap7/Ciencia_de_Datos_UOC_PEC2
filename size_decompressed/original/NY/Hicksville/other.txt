What i saw when i looked up was an object flying around 2000 feet in the air.  The crafts looked like a really big explination point (!) but the bottom was attached to the top and much larger. The larger circular part was leading the entire ship, as if the round part was a control center. It had red white and blue lights all over the bottom of it that had a glow bright enough for me to see it in daylight, and after those 10 to 15 seconds were over the bottom started to dim, then got REALLY bright and then it was gone, it left behind a blueish fog that disappeared fairly quickly. It was so weird and the vibrations made a close by parked car alarm go off..i wish i'd of had a camera (i've never seen anything UFO like it before has anyone else seen this type or is it just me?)  If i'm to be contacted that's fine,,if not, thats fine too.;40.761304854369;-73.5308058252428
