(See below) About five vehicles stopped to see craft that resembled an island. Craft seemed to hover over buildings about 100 feet above them.  Three rows of lights with star light craft floating approx. 50 feet away.  Lights were going in all different directions craft was about the size of three blimps looked as if lights were split in four two large red lights and one large flourescent in the middle.  When craft was moving, it turned into giant island with all different lights and levels of hard metal - very bright lights.  When moving, looked like a giant island in sky with the star object merging with craft craft changed shapes to hard metal object with different heights and levels.  Whe n it took off, it was extremely fast and seemed to disappear instantly.;40.761304854369;-73.5308058252428
