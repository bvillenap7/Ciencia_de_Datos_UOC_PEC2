Invasion of numerous bright orange/yellow lights across sky.;2015-08-01 23:00:00;7 minutes;Invasion of numerous bright orange/yellow lights across sky. On Saturday, Aug 1, 2015, @ approx. 11PM, I was closing up my sun room, to get ready to retire for night.  I happened to look up through the large glass windows, from a now darkened room, and saw what appeared to be this invasion of bright colored orange/yellow lights in formation, slowly moving across the sky, in a left to right movement.   I immediately awoke my son to come and look.  I asked him what he thought this was as it did appear frightening to me.  I had never seen anything like this before except in the movies.   He also said it looked very odd and suspicious.   These lights appeared to drift entirely out of sight in about 7 to 10 minutes in complete harmony.   They did appear to be triangular shaped, with almost a small tail at the end of each, and all being the exact shape and size.;40.761304854369;-73.5308058252428

Firstly appx 8 or 10 in a formation of singular and dual file, then loner objects appeared to follow the same path as the original objects faded, they too followed a similar path until they faded into the sky.;40.761304854369;-73.5308058252428
