Round glowing object observed in Manlius N.Y.;2003-08-20 22:00:00;5 sec;Round glowing object observed in Manlius N.Y. At 10:00 pm EST, August 20th 2003 Broadfield Road in Manlius N.Y. I observed a white glowing round object approximately the size of a bottle cap at half an arms length, slowly traveling from South to North low in the western sky. The object had about the same luminescence as a bright full moon and could still be seen as it passed behind the area trees. Unrestricted viewing observation time was about 2 seconds, total observation time was approximately 5 seconds before the object left the area.
