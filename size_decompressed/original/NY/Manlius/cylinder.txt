7-3-03 A Soundless Vaporless Silver Cylinder Object Flyies East To West In The Suburbs Of Syracuse New York.;2003-07-03 20:40:00;10 seconds;7-3-03 A Soundless Vaporless Silver Cylinder Object Flyies East To West In The Suburbs Of Syracuse New York. I was facing south and I first spotted an unusual flying object about SSW to SW.  From my location the object looked like a silver cigar tube.  I was trying to find the wings or a tail section and neither was visible, if they existed.  The object was in site for about 10 seconds and it did not make a sound.  Furthermore, there was no vapor trail.  It was traveling east to west, but not traveling toward the setting sun: rather it had the sun about 15 degrees off its right side.
