Large quiet craft moving very slow, almost hovering at a high altitude.  Had approximately 4 possibly 5 very bright orange/red pulsating lights, almost a slow breathing effect.  The light brightness made identifying the shape of the craft impossible.  Seen south west from Hadley Ln. Video captured. Night before, I saw a woman and child staring into the sky at the same location, but didn't think much of it until after seeing this the following night. Could possibly be a very large recreational drone, not sure how high they are capable of climbing as this craft went into the clouds.  There were commercial airplanes in the skies as well but they were traveling much faster and higher.  Their light flashes were also faster.;42.9907999999999;-75.9620000000001
