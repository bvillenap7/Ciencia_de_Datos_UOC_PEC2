My two close friends and I were going for a drive, when we suddenly spotted two bright red lighted disk shaped, crafts.  We actually had thought that it was apart of the light tower, but they had looked too big to be apart of it.   As we approached closer in my friends car, they suddenly hovered down a little bit farther north.  The two crafts were also pulsating between red and white lights.   We parked on the side of the road and watched for about 10 minutes.  They were hovering over the ground and almost circling around each other.  One of the crafts hovered down into the trees and I could not see it any longer.   That is when we drove off, shocked as ever.  I have never seen anything like it.
