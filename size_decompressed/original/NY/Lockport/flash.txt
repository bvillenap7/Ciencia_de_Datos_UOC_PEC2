Lockport, NY Sighting.  Hovering object pulsating and emitting different colors.;2003-01-10 04:45:00;7 Minutes;Lockport, NY Sighting.  Hovering object pulsating and emitting different colors. 4:45 AM Friday Morning. I was up late, working at the computer. I went to the window and opened it to get a breath of fresh air. I was shocked to see in the distance a hovering light, that was pulsating colors. It looked like somebody took a flaslight and shut it off and on repeatedly, but very quickly. I saw white, the mail color with different hues of color such as red and yellow. I watched this for about 7 minutes. The Light did not move at all, it seemed to be perfectly stationary. I would of expected some movementin a 7 minute time frame. Near the end of this event, the light became very bright and them dimmed out with a reddish hue. Then it simply vanished, sorta winking out. ((NUFORC Note:  Based on the description by the witness, we wonder whether the light might have been the landing light on an approaching airliner, or perhaps a celestial body, which became obscured by high-level overcast.  Just a surmise on our part.  PD));43.1627259999996;-78.6941380000003
I saw 3 Strobe like objects moving very fast.;2009-09-06 23:00:00;3 minutes;I saw 3 Strobe like objects moving very fast. It was September 6th on a Sunday and we had a nice campfire going for a while.  I was looking at the stars because where I was there is not too much light pollution as to where I live at my moms.  So when I was looking at the stars I noticed 3 strobe like lights heading in a pattern.  3 were flying together and kept going around the sky twice. after that they disappeared and they no longer were there the rest of the night.   I have no idea where they went either, I didn't see them fly off or nothing and it was a cloudless night too.  It's a shame I did not have my camera, I also might add that 9/4/09 I saw an object in the daytime on a cloudless day it looked like a saucer and it was metallic looking but it was far away and I could not see it fully.  We were in the car at the time when we just pulled in the drive way but when I tried to get a better view of it and show my Dad and my brother it was gone.;43.1627259999996;-78.6941380000003
