Saw 6 red round objects high in the sky floating from west to east about 10:30PM 7/5/14.;2014-07-05 22:30:00;4-5 minutes;Saw 6 red round objects high in the sky floating from west to east about 10:30PM 7/5/14 On Saturday July 5th, about 10:30 PM, my son-in-law, and my three grandsons, were sitting  at a fire in my back yard.  My son-in-law took his boys into the house to go to bed. Neighbors just finished shooting off fireworks, which lit up the sky with their various colors. I am now gazing into the clear sky, enjoying the beautiful heavens filled with the many stars and their multiple configurations they made. The front of my house faces west, so I am in the back of the house which faces east.  So I notice this one red round object floating over my house, traveling from west to east.  I notice about 15 seconds later another red object again floating over my house.   So now I am fully involved watching these two red objects and about another 15 seconds, another red object traveling west to east.   As I continue to take this in I notice a fourth red object about 15 seconds behind the first three. All four objects are moving at a slow speed, high up in the sky from west to east.  Then about 25 seconds or so, I see a 5th red object spaced a little farther apart than the first four.  Then about 15 seconds later I notice a 6th red object moving over my hours from west to east. So as I am watching these 6 red objects float overhead, all are red & round and moving in a straight line from west to east.  There is no noise like the sound of a plane coming from these 6 red round objects. Then my son-in-law came back out to sit with me at the fire and I point out to him the red round objects that have now passed us and he saw the last three red objects traveling east. What was strange was that all six objects were red coming at me, passing by me, and then looking at them from behind were all red!;43.1627259999996;-78.6941380000003
