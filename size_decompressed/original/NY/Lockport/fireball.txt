Fireballs with cylinder top heading west to east above lockport NY at 21:30 on 9/21/12;2012-09-21 21:30:00;5 minutes;Fireballs with cylinder top heading west to east above lockport NY at 21:30 on 9/21/12 Seen what at first I thought was a plane on fire in the sky traveling west to east.  I pulled over to get a better look and to watch it as it was still traveling east.  As it got closer it appeared to have a see thru cylinder above the fireball, which made me think that it could be one of those big ballons. It finally passed over me,  I did not see no basket or the ballon part. My son and his girl friend were waiting for me to pick them up at the Palace Theater.  I was just seconds from there and when I arrived, he started to get in and I asked him to look up at it since it was slightly passed but overhead. He also said that it looked like it was on fire.  I told him to keep an eye on it while I was trying to get to a more rural setting so I could park and see it better.  He then informed me that it went into the clouds and all sight was lost. Rain had been predicted for Friday nite into Saturday so there were alot of clouds.I don't know if his girlfriend seen it.! It is now 16:28 9/22/12 I read the Buffalo News and no one report anything that may be able to explain what I seen.  I can't believe that only me and my son this object, at the very least hundreds of people should have seen this object and someone would have reported it to the police or newspaper;43.1627259999996;-78.6941380000003

Single fireball hovering in Lockport at the Niagara County/Erie County border.;2013-11-21 06:25:00;10 minutes;Single fireball hovering in Lockport at the Niagara County/Erie County border. First noticed the fireball while traveling south at Ohio St and the Lockport Bypass.  It was hovering in the south west sky around the Niagara County and Erie County border in Lockport. I traveled south onto Bear Ridge Rd and turned off at Fisk Rd, once I got to Transit Rd and headed south it was gone.   I know it wasn't a plane because soon after it disappeared a plane was making its rounds towards the Buffalo airport, which is a sight I am familiar with every morning.;43.1627259999996;-78.6941380000003
