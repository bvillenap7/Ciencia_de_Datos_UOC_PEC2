My husband and I pulled in our driveway and up the the sky in front of us were 10 to 12 orange lights, it looked like the big dipper and more, moving across the sky.  Then it changed formation but generally kept the same distance, and one by one they faded.  No noise.;43.1627259999996;-78.6941380000003
Yellow/orange lights moving south of lockport.;2012-09-08 21:10:00;3 minutes;yellow/orange lights moving south of lockport. Driving on Rt. 93 we noticed 10 bright orange/yellow lights in the sky south west of our position.  They were much brighter than surrounding stars and seemed to be in  formation with 2 in a line followed by a triangle of 3 then 2 more and another triangle of 3.   We pulled over and exited vehicle and observed them for about 2 more minutes.  They were traveling slowly in an easterly direction.  There was no sound from the objects.  We could not observe any shape but they appeared to be too far apart to be from a single source. After viewing for approx. 2 minutes they seemed to fade one at a time until they were no longer visible.  There was a commercial jet making a landing at the time of the sighting. Witnesses were 54 year old male and 43 year old female. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter, I apologize.. was lookig at a hotel booking cofirmation and confued the week..  It was 9/8/2012.

Bright, white light in Buffalo sky.;2014-06-21 22:30:00;5 minutes;Bright, white light in Buffalo sky. I was outside my house on the patio having a cigarette and noticed that there was no moon in the sky so I could see many more stars in the night sky than usual.   While observing the stars, I noticed a bright light in the SW part of the sky moving.  I first thought it was a typical airplane or helicopter, but there weren't any red/green lights or any sound.  Then I thought it may be a meteor, but it was moving way to slow.  While it was travelling roughly the same speed as a typical aircraft, I knew that it couldn't be one.  (Growing up in the area near the Buffalo/Niagara airport, I am very aware of all the aircraft coming in and out of the airspace in the area)   This was no typical aircraft.  The light moved from the WSW to ENE night sky for about 3 mins before it simply vanished.   Very strange.;43.1627259999996;-78.6941380000003
