It was not moving and seemed to be at the same distance the whole time.  At one point it turned into a  bright orange ball the same size as the bight ball of light. Then a few minutes later back to the bright ball of light. I watched for about 25 minutes altogether.  Finally it turned back into the orange ball and quickly got smaller and smaller until it disappeared about 15 seconds later.  Someone told me that the faster it goes from large to small is the rate of speed it is traveling at. I know for sure now that there is something out there.;43.1627259999996;-78.6941380000003
