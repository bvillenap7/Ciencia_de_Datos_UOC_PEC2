Wierd moving lights in the sky;2004-05-16 09:30:00;5min;Wierd moving lights in the sky I was driving home and noticed some lights in the sky, I see alot of planes near my house and these lights caught my attention because i never say so many on a plane before.  At first I thought it was because it was turning and I was able to see all the lights at once, but it still seemed very different.  It also was just sitting there and was not moving, so I just keeped looking and wondering what it was. Then it moves vertically very fast like nothing i have ever seen, then it slowed down and went under the tree line, and I know a plane could not go that low so i dont know what happened.  After I just keeped thinking about it and I could not explaine what i just saw.;43.1627259999996;-78.6941380000003

I seemed to be moving steadily in a slanted angle.  I knew it wasnt a plane or helicopter from its possition and silence and its range.  From its behovioral movements it couldnt possibly be a meteriot.and after staring at it for a while its slowly ascended and drifted off until i was a small as a star in the sky unil it disappeared ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

An orange glowing, fiery light, large or close, flying in a south easterly direction.;2014-07-04 23:15:00;90 seconds;An orange glowing, fiery light, large or close, flying in a south easterly direction. We saw a bright orange glowing orb, similar to fire, fly overhead and out of site in about 90 seconds.   A similar occurrence happened last year, 7/29/13, involving two identical objects which were exact matches to this evening's sighting. Last year I thought they may have been Hot Air Balloons.  They seemed to travel too fast o be Hot Air Balloons.;43.1627259999996;-78.6941380000003

Me, my wife, and a friend saw a strange, cloud-like ring in the night sky;2020-08-30 21:00:00;~3 minutes;Me, my wife, and a friend saw a strange, cloud-like ring in the night sky Was on my deck, watching tv. My wife came upstairs and said there's something strange in the sky. Upon looking at the area where she directed me, I saw what appeared to be a cloud with a spotlight hitting it. However, there were no clouds in the sky, and the object was slowly moving north-south. It stayed in what seemed to be a straight line.  More details about the object in question:  There appeared to be a small, hazy light in the center with a cloud-like ring surrounding it.  The ring was vertical in the sky.  Seemed to be slightly luminescent, although the moon was bright and may have been reflecting against it. As we watched, a faint, second ring seemed to form around it.  We watched it until it went behind some trees and we could no longer see it.;43.1627259999996;-78.6941380000003
