A long object with very bright lights;2003-09-24 21:00:00;3min.;A long object with very bright lights Last night my Daughter and I were walking in from the barn and I said to her how clear the sky was and to look at all the stars. There were alot of planes also and I mentioned to her that I haven't seen this many planes in the sky at once. Then as we continued toward the house I looked up and said what the ???? is that!!! There in the sky above our house was a long object, very bright, moving slowly. The sound was NOT an airplane. We didn't know if it was a blimp, so if it was could someone please let  us know.;43.2655;-73.5856
