One glowing orange (seemingly) rectangular sort of shape moving steadily as a plane would, from north to south across a clear evening sky. Constant orange glow, no flashing lights, or change of color.   Once overhead,(12:00) the glowing disappeared at around the 2:00 mark.  No sound could be heard. My wife and granddaughter returned from the store, and had been watching it while driving home. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
