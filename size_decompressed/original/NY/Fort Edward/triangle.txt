I was outside under a clear starlit sky, trying to locate the North Star when a triangular object flew over my visual path, moving at a high rate of speed.  It's altitude was typically the height of a small piper cub, but no sound was heard.  There were lights under it, maybe 3 different colors , but I could see no other details.;43.2655;-73.5856
