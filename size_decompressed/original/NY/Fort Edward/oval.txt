White object traveling fast;2011-09-13 13:00:00;10 minutes;white object traveling fast as i was watching my roof being replaced i was talking to the job foreman as we were looking up  we both spotted this round white object moving in the blue sky at such speed we were amazed .   this object was going so fast that the momentum should have caused it to slow before coming to a complete stop but it stopped quickly and changed directions several time .   the foreman and i just laughed and said if they can do that, well theres nothing we can do about it anyways and we just laughed .  but we both believe they do exist .....
