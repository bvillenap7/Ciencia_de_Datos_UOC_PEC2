It caught my attention first, because of its strange shape which i would describe as a single object made of 2 long, thin, white ovals connected at ends.  Second reason it caught my attention was the fact there was no noise of any kind. No buzzing of an airplane, no screeching/soaring of a jet, nothing.  Third there was no chemtrail/contrail behind object.  I cant really give an estimate as to the altitude but it seemed very high and moving fast for that altitude. It was heading in the general direction of south west but more west than south if you no what I mean.  I saw it briefly then lost it as it moved over the woods across the street.  Yesterday I saw 3 white objects in the sky which flew straight then circled each other in a triangular pattern.  I assumed them to be birds but Im not so sure now.;43.2655;-73.5856

We saw 4 solid white lights in close formation moving south west vertical to the ground the craft then went horizontally and the four lights seemed to become brighter!  They then split into two separate crafts one went in the direction NW the other continued southwest!;43.2655;-73.5856
