Large Shaped disk, redish flame around disk.;1988-06-10 02:00:00;2 minutes;Large Shaped disk, redish flame around disk. Me and a friend were out late soaping windows when we were 15 and when walking home bright flashes of light lite up the woods and road like it was daylight. Clear night, no moon, no clouds, lots of stars. Large disk shaped craft (at what seemed to be a little above tree top level-its been a long time) with red flame on bottom of craft flew over our heads makeing no noise at all. Then flew off very, very fast. Time was about 2:00 am.;42.1215;-76.2496
2 Flying discs over Owego, New York, USA.;2013-10-12 13:00:00;2 minutes;2 Flying discs over Owego, New York, USA On the 12th day of October 2013, at about 13:00hrs EST, I witnessed a disc like object flying from north east over the Village of Owego, New York.  Object omitted no sound, there was no “trail” after it there was no visible wings of any kind.   A short 22 second video taken on a camera phone was shot.  The disc moved from South West to the North East over the western horizon.      Shortly after another object same size and shape, no wings, no trail, no sound was observed flying from east (Binghamton, NY ) to the North West, however higher in the sky than the first object.   Having observed thousands of flights going over this area in the last 30 years, I have never seen anything like this before.;42.1215;-76.2496
