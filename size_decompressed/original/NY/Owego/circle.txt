Bright blowy silver round object vanished in the sky;2012-11-16 16:30:00;~1 second;Bright blowy silver round object vanished in the sky I was waiting at the bus stop with my dad to pick up my daughter and my dad told me to  look up and across from Waverly Road, through a farm on glenmary drive up a hill in the sky was this small round silver bright blowy thing and it was only there for a second and it vanished in the sky.  Really not much to say just that my father and I were in complete shock because we never saw anything like that before.  It did not look like a airplane or helicopter because they usual are visible to see until gone. I can not explain it only it looked like it vanished threw something.  I am reporting this because I think its important for you to know and investigate.  Thank you;42.1215;-76.2496
