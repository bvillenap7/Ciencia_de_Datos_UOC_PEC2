Object with multicolored lights, 2 times in the last 2 weeks staying in one spot in the sky for a long period of time;2016-07-19 02:00:00;over a half hr watched...;seen object with multicolored lights 2 times in the last 2 weeks staying in one spot in the sky for a long period of time two times in the last 2 weeks, myself and one other person saw what looked like a single object with multicolor lights sit in the sky and not move for a long period of time.  The first time I saw it I was at a park in Newark Valley, NY, about 13 miles from where we just saw the one on the report.  That one, after a long time in one spot, changed its light to a solid bright white light and took off across the sky.  The one from tonight I watched w/ binoculars for about 1hr and went back inside.  The 1st time I saw it the first thing we could think of was it was a chinese candle deal, but it stayed in one spot.  Second thought it could be a drone, but it was to big to be one to see it as far away as it appeared;42.1215;-76.2496
