Was watching a movie at a drive in place when I stared into the sky and saw a light behind the clouds, which I thought was the moon, until I saw 3 lights move vertically to that glowing light.   Lights were triangular shaped.  Not blinking and the top light was red.  Once it reached the light, I thought was the moon behind the clouds it disappeared immediately.   Looked around, and the Moon was in the opposite direction.;41.8465;-73.5545
