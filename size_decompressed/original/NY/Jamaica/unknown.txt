So we stoped to get a better look. The object  was moving extremly slooooow over a building about 1 mile away. At first we thought it was a plane or helicopter, then we realized that if it were either one, we would of heard the sound of the engine or the spinning of the copter blades. Another thing that we noticed was the size of this thing. It was HUGE. because at that distance, it covered the roof tops of a few buildings. The best estimate we can give, is that it was probably the lenght of two football feilds, but we may be a little off. Anyway after 6 minutes or so, we heard a loud sound approchaing from behind us, when we looked up there were four airforce or army jets heading the the direction of the craft. When the jets got closer to the craft, it moved away slowly and faded out of site and It was a pretty clear night. no clouds in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We don't know what it was the witnesses observed, but we would want to rule out a blimp as the first step in any investigation.  There are blimps over NYC on a frequent basis, we observe.  PD));40.7015832894731;-73.8412481578941

On the way home we decided to walk from the motel to Hillside and archer ave which is some distance away(PLEASE check distance yourself). We left the motel at 11:07 pm stoped and talked for about 10 min, as we were walking down Hillside Ave my girlfriend noticed a light in the sky. It wasn't bright or glowing as most UFO's are discribed at first glimpse I thought it was a plane, then she pointed out the the pattern of the lights which were really weird and we know it wasn't a plane because the height at which it was flying we would of definatly heard it and it was moving extreamly slow. We watched it for about 5-7 min then it started to move at average speed of plane in flight. I made a joke and said that the only way we would know it is a UFO was if we were to see a couple of jets go after it and like 2 min after making that statement we heard a loud noise and looked up and saw 4 jets going after the craft. When the jets got closer, the craft took at sucha tremdous speed it was unbeliveible.;40.7015832894731;-73.8412481578941
