A bright white-yellow object hovering and then moving in NY.;2007-12-09 05:45:00;10 minutes;A bright white-yellow object hovering and then moving in NY. At around 5:45 am on 12/11/07 I was letting my dogs out in the backyard when I saw an oval object in the sky to my right side when I opened the door.  It was approximately about a mile away from where I was.  I saw white-yellow lights illuminating it (it was very bright).  The incident occurred in Hillcrest (Queens), New York. My mom looked out her bedroom window and saw the object moving very fast and made a sharp turn and disappeared. This object moved quicker than usual planes do and was much brighter.  A few moments later we noticed an unusual number of planes in the area.  My mom also said that she saw what she thought at first was a star (because it was not moving) but then it began to move very quickly (more quickly then the planes we saw before). She is not sure if this was the same UFO or a different one.  Planes continued to move in that area for some time which is very unusual because we normally do not have much plane activity at that time (or with that many planes in a short period of time). I remember my mom saying how dangerous it must be for the planes since there were so many of them that the possibility of them colliding was high. (Although she never saw them together- just one right after another moving past our house);40.7015832894731;-73.8412481578941
