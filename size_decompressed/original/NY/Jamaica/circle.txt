Low rumbling sound from a stationary object that emits a beam.;2019-04-19 12:30:00;20 minutes;Low rumbling sound from a stationary object that emits a beam. I heard a low lawn mower sound for at least 20 minutes, assuming my neighbor was doing some weird activity as usual or what not.  Until I looked out the window I saw the strangest thing, a stationary object in the sky that was perfectly still that was emitting a beam of light. I took a video and 3 minutes afterwards the beam turned off and it flew away.  It was closer than an airplane, almost like the distance of a blimp.   I would like to send this video, but I don't know how to mail it.;40.7015832894731;-73.8412481578941
