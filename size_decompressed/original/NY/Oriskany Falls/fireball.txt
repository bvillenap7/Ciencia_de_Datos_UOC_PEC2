Bright cicrclar objects moved VERY fast;2008-08-30 22:30:00;~5 minutes;Bright cicrclar objects moved VERY fast We were at a party at Lebanon reservoir when a very bright circular object appeared the horizon to the south. It appeared almost as if it were engulfed in flames.  The object came north towards us then turned and went east very quickly. much faster than any terrestrial air craft Ive ever encountered.  Then about a half hour later another came and went. It was obviously not a balloon or a firework or something due to the longevity of its flight and its ridiculous speed. There were several witnesses in attendance.  There were several other commercial aircraft in the vivinity at the time suggesting governmental experimentation.  There is a air force base within 20 or so minutes of here but its in the middle of the city of Rome, NY, what ever this was would have been easily spotted on take off.;42.9561;-75.4889
