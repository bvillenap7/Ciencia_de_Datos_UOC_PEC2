High Altitude Flying Abnormally blinking object;2008-05-29 11:00:00;1 minute;High Altitude Flying Abnormally blinking object Last night 5/29/08 I was in the backyard doing some homework. I decided to look at the stars for a while, it was a clear night. Suddenly one of the stars began to move at a very very high altitude. It moved at a constant pace and it began to shut off and then blink, move a bit more at the same speed and then blink on again. One of the blinks was significantly brighter than the others. It mimicked a star. While staring I got a feeling of wellbeing all around me and I got goose bumps. I kept my eye on it and tried to follow as far as I could have when a low flying plane came by and distracted me. I could not find it again but I knew what I saw didnâ€™t blink like a plane because the lights on a plane do not go off for 5 seconds at a time, they are constantly blinking.;40.7044828571429;-73.59338
