Humongous craft seen in Nassau county long island;2011-11-13 20:00:00;5 mins;Humongous craft seen in Nassau county long island Driving on hemstead turnpike near hofsta saw a light formation with that basically made a shape of what I could only say is a huge craft.  You could Definatley see the dark mass as a whole.  I would say it was 20 moons across.  It floated stationary then just faded away. I took video but it came out kind of bad because I was shaking. I never believed in any of this but it was Definatley there I Was 100 % sober.  I don't know what to do with myself it really scared me I'm Definatley not sleeping tonight.;40.7044828571429;-73.59338
