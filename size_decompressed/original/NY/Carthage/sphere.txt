Red and blue sphere shaped object in the trees flew away;2006-05-01 21:20:00;30 seconds;Red and blue sphere shaped object in the trees flew away We were driving along route 3A when in the trees to our right we saw a sphere shaped object with red and blue flashing lights.  The object appeared to be in  the trees very low to the ground.  We then turned the car around to go back and see what it was but it was literally moving away quickly and the lights turned off.  It seemed as if it was disappearing before our eyes.  We kept driving back and forth trying to spot it but there was no sight of it and it seemed to disappear into the sky..;43.9813000000001;-75.6059
