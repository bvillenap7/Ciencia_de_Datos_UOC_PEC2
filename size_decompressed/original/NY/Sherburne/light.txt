It was approximately 11:00pm (23:00)  On December 17, 2014.  At first it appeared not to move, we observed this for a minute ,the location and color was peculiar so I pulled over to the side of the road . It was a cloudy night , the clouds were  high , no stars could be seen in the sky.  The light was located high in the sky at 45 degree angle in front  us ,above route 12 .  Then it shot across the sky very fast to our left from in front of us to a ten o’clock position .  It stopped made a few short up and down , right and left movements and real small tight circles then shot across the sky to our right to a two o’clock position, it stopped then disappeared . The light did change from the bright blue to and amber color a few times while moving &gt I attempted to take picture with a digital camera but it could not focus in and take pictures But  I did get 47 seconds of video on my Ipod .  I estimate we observed this for 3 to 4 minutes .  The light was high in the sky above an open field when it when out .;42.6859;-75.483
