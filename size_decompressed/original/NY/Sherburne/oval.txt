A short distance from our house, (down the road) my mother and I witnessed an oval/diamond shaped object surrounded by a misty pink light that seemed to have flashed .  It was hovering approximately 40 feet above the road in the northeast region of Knapp Road in SherburneWit. We watched it continue in that direction until it disappeared.  My grandparents told us that they heard a sound like someone was blowing into a bottle at the time we saw the object.  We did not hear anything because we were inside the car.  We heard strange howling/ air-movement sounds for the next few hours but it was not windy out.  Our family has witnessed two other sightings in the past two years, in the month of October.  Both times there were three yellow, oval/diamond shaped objects in the eastern sky around 9:30 pm and lasted for about three hours.  Each object moved separately and sporatically, but kept the same distance between themselves. They moved at very high speeds. We did not see them leave.;42.6859;-75.483
