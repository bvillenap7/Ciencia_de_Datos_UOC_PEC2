Continual light shaped orbs sightings over the past 10 years first picture evidence;2020-12-19 15:00:00;15-30m;Continual light shaped orbs sightings over the past 10 years first picture evidence Hi, first of all this is just one observation of phenomena that has been captured from a credible source in the community. I will say as a long time resident of the Adirondacks over the years there have been hundreds of sightings of anomalous events. I grew up in a town which is smack middle in the Adirondacks, if your unfamiliar the Adirondacks is the largest state park by continuous land mass in the entire United States, while populated there are vast vast regions of it which is forever wild and is extremely parsely populated in most regions. While growing up it was very common for everyone to report sightings of interesting lights, formations, hovering objects, pretty much everyone I grew up with can attest to being in the woods and at some point observing some sort of unexplained phenomena, to the point where it no longer became an event of interest between us kids, it was just part of living up there.  Here is just one example of series of sightings in that region: https://www.syracusenewtimes.com/2000-ufo-adirondack-formation-lights/  https://www.newyorkupstate.com/western-ny/2020/02/ufo-sightings-in-upstate-ny-grew-in-2019-where-were-the-most-reports.html  https://www.newyorkupstate.com/news/g66l-2019/01/19183adc03d74/-there-were-65-ufo-sightings-in-upstate-ny-in-2018-did-aliens-visit-your-town.html  https://patch.com/new-york/larchmont/151-ufo-sightings-new-york-so-far-2019-what-they-saw  The description of these sightings follow the same pattern of many of the eye witness accounts I heard about all threw childhood and even observed myself. I've had friends, family, staunch I don't believe in that shit to oh shit what did I just observe eye witness accounts. Whether or not this specific encounter can be explained as natural phenomena there are other events which are frankly unexplainable massive orb like objects hovering in the air making erratic movements and speeding off at speeds much faster than any known conventional aircraft.  In the Gore Mountain region there is both an active and old Garnet Mine in North Creek NY. This seems to be of specific interest to these objects. I've had an eye witness account which observed a massive orb like object extending a metallic arm over the active mine, when this witness observed the object he said he was paralyzed with fear at its sheer magnitude, he said after he observed it, it quickly recognized him and the object which was the size and circumference of at least two football field, started to deploy a clocking device. He said the object started to get wavy at the edges and he observed that in the span of 5-10 seconds the entire object being engulfed in a ripple that made it completely camouflaged with the sky behind it, to the point where it was invisible. The man the ran inside and discounted what he saw only to realize that what he saw was real. This is the most in-depth knowledge of specific details on the structure of these crafts. Again they were descri! bed as a large shaped dome with a smaller dome underneath but instead of completely spherical there was a large jut liked rectangle extending below the bottom dome and a small metallic like arm structured with a prong at the tip  Additional the large majority of the sightings of these crafts are in LOW LYING areas, I would say that 5% of my interviews with locals is that these craft have been observed barely hovering over the tree lines of hills 90% have been these people observing these objects hovering directly over low lying bodies of water in the various lakes around the park, generally in some sort of formation, almost all encounters say that they're an orange red like orb, my theory is that when these objects are in a flying state they omit light, the other 5% of observations are at the mines themselves it seems when they are mining they do not omit light but can cloak the craft with some sort of camouflage, all the sightings of the crafts at the mines are at night. All other sightings of the craft when observed not near bodies of water seem to be in the hills surrounding the mines which seems to suggest that the garnet may be used as an energy source for these craft whe! re they mine small amounts in a deactivated state and then reactivate after mining.  Now onto the only photographic evidence I've ever managed to find of these craft this was reported yesterday by a long time local and respected member of the community whose lived in an isolated area, they are literally the only people living on one hill which is surrounded by forever wilderness i.e. they're basically the last people in between civilization and 10 million acres of wild -- no humans. Here is the pictures I did my best to upload the series as they occurred:  https://ibb.co/gzqNbs7  https://ibb.co/7RDZt8F  https://ibb.co/nrj7Gr8  https://ibb.co/FJQsR2C  They sent me these photos, while the moon is in the ESE direction they observed that this craft came over the hill hovered and then lowered again and then disappeared. Also notice that the moon is in a waxing crescent phase and can not be simply explained as part of a full moon lunar cycle. The craft is the size of other encounters which is about 2 football fields, and is located in the vicinity of and old garnet mine Here is the vicinity of the observed craft: https://www.google.com/maps/place/South+Mountain/@43.7079083,-74.0557715,3942m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x89df9abc66c75387:0x8cb17f602dfdeb81!8m2!3d43.7106204!4d-74.0451355  Here is the location of both the new and old garnet mines:  Old mine: https://www.google.com/maps/place/Garnet+Mine+Tours/@43.681181,-74.0587279,1370m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sbarton+mines!3m4!1s0x0:0x760d0cb4cf4464d5!8m2!3d43.6829799!4d-74.0593743  (Active) New mine:  https://www.google.com/maps/search/mine/@43.7313656,-74.1131728,2054m/data=!3m1!1e3  There have been at least two encounters of the same looking orb in the same vicinity on opposite sides of the mountain 2 years apart, the one two years ago however was observed in a formation of 3 objects in a v formation here:  https://www.google.com/maps/@43.7002856,-74.0533241,9678m/data=!3m1!1e3  This lake has also seen multiple sightings:  https://www.google.com/maps/@43.6914682,-74.0851313,9681m/data=!3m1!1e3  I will also note that there is large occurrence of traditional military aircraft in this area too from F-16's, Apaches, Drones, Black Hawks etc going in and out of the wilderness: https://www.google.com/maps/place/Siamese+Ponds+Wilderness/@43.5677055,-74.4279141,53051m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x89df9fe5c1982411:0x6814ae93312d63e9!8m2!3d43.5677055!4d-74.2315292  As for this picture evidence it seems the orb moved in a SE fashion towards the old Garnet mine, it then was reported to hover an abruptly move backwards to the west, you can see with the dimming sunlight in the back that the pictures support that the movement from E to W is valid as the last photo which shows it moving to the W is in a chronologically older time frame. The total occurrence of the observance was 15-30 minutes.  All I am looking for is maybe some recognition and explanations as to what people are observing here. People in this region are very comfortable with the observations most just joke its the aliens again and is pretty well accepted that just weird shit happens, almost nobody speaks up for fear of being labelled the mountain man nutcase. I will tell you though that there is an absolute hot bed of UAP/UFO activity in the Adirondack State Park.  If there is a natural explanation for this I'd like to know thank you.;43.7237;-74.0873
