They were flying slowly together in perfect unison, but in no particular order or shape.  At first I thought it was one huge (about 2 football fields long)object, but I THINK they were separate objects...then, after about 2 minutes, they, in no specific order, one-by-one, sometimes two at a time, just disappeared.   They moved so perfectly together and did not sway or waiver at all.   They definitely were not balloons or planes or flares or anything that we've ever seen.   They also had to have some sort of silent engines because they were 'powered' through the sky.   Made a believer out of me!;40.7834;-72.89
