Wierd neon green object.;2005-08-25 22:00:00;3 Seconds;Wierd neon green object. It was a clear night and I was standing outside having a cigaret when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. I looked up and saw a neon green spherical object. It was heading pretty much due south towards the Atlantic. I think it was a meteor, but the odd thing was its speed. It seemed to be traveling way too slow to be a shooting star , but way too fast to be an aircraft. Now, I'm a pilot and I'm aware of the fact that altitude has a lot to due with how fast something seems to be moving, but I think whatever this was remaned in the upper atmosphere the whole time I saw it. The reason I say this is because it never really got close to the horizon before it faded out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));40.7834;-72.89
