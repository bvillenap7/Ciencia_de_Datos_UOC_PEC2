At approximately 9:15 pm on 1.6.2021 as I exited my car and walked up the driveway towards my mother’s home, I  noticed a very bright object in the sky that appeared to be similar to the “Bethlehem Star” which I believed to no longer be visible.  I went in the house and asked my mother for binoculars so that I could take a look at this object.  When focused on the object in the SE skyline I could see very brilliant white, blue, yellow, reddish lights that glistened and pulsated. The object appeared to be spherical but not a perfect circle.  I observed it in its location for approximately 7 to 8 minutes.  My mother also took a look through the binoculars and saw exactly what I did.  My step father also came out to take a look through the binoculars and he saw the same thing my mother and I had.  I took approximately 3 pictures with my Samsung Galaxy S8 and went on to visit with my mother. When I went to leave for the night at approximately 10:15 pm, my mother went outside to see if the object was still there. She said it was no longer there and I took a look to see that it had moved to the south (?)  in the sky (right of its original position).  I then  borrowed my mother’s Galaxy phone as it is newer than mine,  and snapped two more pictures.  When I took the last picture I noticed that the object appeared to move slowly.  After snapping the picture I noticed there to be two additional objects very similar to the bright sphere I first noticed in the sky and a total of 3 objects appear in the picture.  Pictures will be emailed to director@ufocenter.com;43.0019;-73.6609
