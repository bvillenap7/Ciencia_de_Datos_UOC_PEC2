Three low,silent craft hovering,looping over each other,flaring huge,bright,then fly head-on near-collision course.Videotaped;1999-01-04 21:50:00;16 minutes;Three low,silent craft hovering,looping over each other,flaring huge,bright,then fly head-on near-collision course.Videotaped Driving on Lake Avenue in Stillwater I and another witness saw a brightly lit silent craft hovering, then moving very slowly just over the trees. I pulled my car over and began videotaping. It was lit from underneath, an intense yellow-orange solid light, round or oval, and with a smaller light above sometimes visible revealing a dark unlit mass above the light.                                                   I drove a little further to get a view unobstructed by the bare tree branches,then drove again to get closer. I knew I was close to Flike Road where I had videotaped a dramatic sighting on December 18th,and it was a safer road to stop on,so I sped there.                            Just as I turned the corner we saw the craft heading slowly away from us,and loop directly over another similar craft. The higher craft's bright light showed more clearly an unlit upper section of the craft that passed beneath. This maneuver brought them dangerously close to each other,and the lower craft's altitude was less than fifty feet, the other not much higher. The one craft was so low, lower than the tops of trees it passed behind, I thought it may have been on the ground, or possibly coming up from the nearby Hudson River. I pulled a little closer. One craft seemed to change into a flat triangle with multiple warm lights and traveled more quickly, moving off to the west. I believe that these craft can sit upright to hover and move very slowly, like a rocket does when lifting off. Instead of a rocket engine it seems to be balanced over a glowing globe which could be its source of lift or propulsion. I think these craft can lower themselves from upright to a horizontal attitude, which reveals them to be triangular or near triangular with a slightly rounded back end. They travel faster in a more direct line in this position. However, it's the nose of the triangle that seems to be the bright round light, which leads me to think that when they sit upright (or at least at a 45 degree angle) t! hey may be sitting on the nose rather than the back end. As the one passed behind the trees there was a second smaller light visible above the main light but at an angle, resembling a tipped cone or party hat drifting slowly sideways. It could also be sitting upright on its nose but with the third point unlit or unseen from my vantage point. Then, a third craft rose up from the trees to the right, across a field. It seemed triangular, brightly lit underneath, casting a diffuse beam of light before it. It traveled east towards the remaining craft and as they got closer they, too, looped one over the other. It was a strange, silent aerobatic maneuver, but graceful. To see it performed twice, minutes apart, and involving three different craft, was startling. The craft were all drifting to the south, so I drove to follow, losing sight of them for a few minutes.I pause the tape. When I turned the corner onto George Thompson Road I saw one hovering over a cornfield and began filming again. As soon as I turned on my hazard lights and got out of the car it bagan to flare incredibly brightly, like a yellow-orange flame with an aura around it, like it was burning, on the videotape it seems more white than it did to the naked eye. It also seemed to get much bigger,as large as the moon, and totally round. It was larger and brighter than anything I've ever seen in the night sky besides a full moon. It may have come quite close to us, and I'm a little concerned about that, I've heard accounts of UFO witnesses being affected by radiation. To some that may sound a little far-fetched, but I guarantee you'd feel the same if you were there with us. After a minute it started to move away from us, and then was clearly a flat triangular craft. As I continued filming it travel west over Route 67, we saw a second tria! ngle come into view going east. They were on a collision course,one was higher than the other and they even adjusted their altitudes to head right for one another, nose to nose. I expected one to veer off as they got closer but they didn't,they came closer than the width of either craft, literally feet from colliding head-on. We both thought they had collided until they passed each other. It was unbelievable, and I was thrilled to have this, any of this really, on videotape.Then the east bound craft turned around to follow the other and they flew out of our sight. I have sent a copy of this tape to Mr. Davenport and the NUFORC in Seattle.;43.0019;-73.6609
