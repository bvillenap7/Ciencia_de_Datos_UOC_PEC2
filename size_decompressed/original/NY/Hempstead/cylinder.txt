Cylindrical object seen over Long Island, N.Y..;2014-12-26 17:00:00;20 minutes;Cylindrical object seen over Long Island, N.Y.. Hi. my name is ((name deleted)).  I was on my way to cash my check at the regular check cashing spot I usually go to.  On my way there I stop at the crossing light and saw to my left across the street what I thought at first was a jet taking off, as I'm near several airports and a few military bases. I kept an eye on this object that resembled a jet or missile going into the sky at a 90Â° angle.  As it kept going up, it disappeared and then after 5 seconds or so it reappeared, but the funny thing is that it slowed down to a total stop and was now much bigger.  It resembled a pill or a cylinder shape.  It stayed there for about 6 to 8 minutes.  At this time I was getting ready to cross the street and looked away for one second and when I looked back up it was gone.  Except I saw the tail of smoke it left. Now two minutes later a helicopter appeared going in the direction in which the object was just at. I watched this helicopter circle around for at least five or ten minutes and then it left.  I couldn't believe this was happening. I wish my camera/video recorder was working but it wasn't. The other funny thing is that I seem to be the only person interested in looking at this object.  This hasn't been the first time I've seen something strange and it won't be the last. T Thank you for listening.   C.T.C.am!;40.7045256756756;-73.617927027027
