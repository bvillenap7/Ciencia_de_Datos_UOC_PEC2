Aura or haze emitting light in the shape of a dove.    ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.  PD));2004-08-31 21:00:00;25 min;Aura or haze emitting light in the shape of a dove. It was a crystal clear night without any clouds. I saw a glowing, very hazy and dim  light heading toward me. It was at about 45 to 50 degrees in the northwest, heading southeast at a very, very slow speed. It took about 25 to 30 minutes to be directly overhead, at a very high altitude. I called for my son and daughter to look at it with binoculars, and it looked like a glowing blue/greenish cloud emitting streaks of light in the shape of a bird or dove. The object never changed shape, or speed, and slowly faded out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.
