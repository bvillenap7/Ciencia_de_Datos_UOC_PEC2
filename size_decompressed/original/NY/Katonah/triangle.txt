It was a solid, metallic surface and a red, yellow and blue light on the underside. Traveling toward Whitehall Corners in Somers with my mother, sister (w/friend), my 5 year old brother spotted a plane that wasn't moving. We slowly approached the old Cherry St. bridge and I yelled,STOP! We stopped directly in the center of the bridge. Though it was a busy route, no other car was witness to this. I stuck my head out the window, looked directly up, and saw a flat, triangular form against the night sky. A triangle with one point missing. The craft was small, maybe 50ft across and absolutely silent. A red, green and blue light were diagonally across the underside. When I finally confirmed what I was looking at, I was terrified. I told my mother to hit the gas and we watched it behind us as we sped away. I was 14 at the time and though its been 15 years, this one is etched in my mind forever.;41.2709;-73.6857
