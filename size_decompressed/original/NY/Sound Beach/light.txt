White Light changed to orange ball.;2011-05-01 21:30:00;4 minutes;White Light changed to orange ball One night (not sure of date) I saw what I believed to be a helicopter coming over my neighbors house and illuminating my yard.  There was no sound so I was busy and ignored it and went inside.  Two nights later I saw the light in the same place (from the south) coming over my neighbors so I went in the house and told my brother and wife to take a look.   My wife refused to come out so me and my brother watched the light get bigger.   It then in a flash it shrunk and turned orange zoomed straight up (and a little to the east) until it turned into a tiny red dot and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.9561;-72.9716
