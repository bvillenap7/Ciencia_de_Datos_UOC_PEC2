4 large orbs moving in a circular pattern then moving to the cntr and moving out again, 45 minutes.  ((NUFORC Note:  Adv. Lights?  PD));2014-10-17 21:45:00;45 minutes;Witnessed 4 large orbs moving in a circular pattern then moving to the center and moving out again, this lasted for 45 minutes. My husband and I were in the house when my dog went to the glass door and was watching something across the street.  She was pointing at something and watching it very intently.  My husband went to see what she was looking at and he saw moving orbs of light across the street.  I went and watched.  The whole event lasted for 45 minutes.  The orbs were huge, each was about 30 feet in diameter.  They moved above a pond and were about 500 feet away from where we were.  There was no sound.  The four orbs were just above the clouds and were in the north sky.  The four orbs moved in a square clock-wise pattern, and then moved to the center as one slightly larger light, the light stayed in the center for a few seconds and then the four light orbs moved out into a square pattern again and they rotated clockwise.  It seemed almost as though they were gathering energy from their movement.  It gradually got larger and at one point there were five orbs in a pentagon movi! ng.  The clouds became a bit denser and it seemed like they were slowly moving away to the north, however, I could still see them.  Finally, the orbs moved to the center and disappeared.
