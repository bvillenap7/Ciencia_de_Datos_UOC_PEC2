Bright orange object with no sound moving across sky then disappeared;2020-11-28 21:30:00;5 minutes;Bright orange object with no sound moving across sky then disappeared My cousin an I were looking up at the sky when we noticed a bright orange or fire colored object moving across sky. Object was moving in a straight horizontal line at pretty fast speed relative to apparent altitude. However, we were not able to distinguish any features due to brightness of object. We followed it down the street in which it appeared to get smaller and smaller and disappear. The distance it covered was not far enough to become that small before disappearing. There was no sound so it couldn't of been a helicopter and no wind to propel a paper fire lantern that fast.;40.6768;-73.6628
