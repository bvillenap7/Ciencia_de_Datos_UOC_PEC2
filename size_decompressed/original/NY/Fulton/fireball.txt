three triangle shaped objects on fire in the sky;2011-07-31 00:00:00;20;three triangle shaped objects on fire in the sky I was out fishing with my two best friends when I heard a low pitched humming sound coming from behind me I turn around and looked up into the sky only to see something that looked like it was on fire I thought it might have been a plane or a helicopter that was on fire and I was yelling to my friends what the fuck is that and they both looked and they also were puzzled we sat there and watched this object disappear into the tree lines and we talked over this trying to figure out what this thing is that we seen then a second one appeared and this one moved over to the same spot the last one disappeared but only hovered over the trees and then got smaller until it faintly disappeared into the sky we got some pictures with a Iphone but they are just faint dots and are pixilated when you zoom in on it. At this point my friends were very scared and wanted to leave so we got in the car and started heading back home as we were going down the road we seen a third o! ne and we pulled into the Longley dodge car dealership and watched as this third one moved until it disappeared into the sky. From what I seen it looked like a triangle that was on fire and it pulsated orange and red.  The first and second sighting was off of county road 57 at a boat launch.;43.3211;-76.4033999999997

Five bright orange objects.;2017-05-13 21:05:00;10 minutes;Five bright orange objects While outside my daughter asked what five glowing orange objects were in the sky.  They were in arched pattern for approximately 5 minutes moving very slowly to the northeast and upward.   As I sent my daughter in to get my phone to record them, the top three seemed to just disappear.  I was able to record (although not as impressive as viewing live) the remaining two.   They continued northeast and upward for another minute or two, and disappeared themselves.;43.3211;-76.4033999999997
