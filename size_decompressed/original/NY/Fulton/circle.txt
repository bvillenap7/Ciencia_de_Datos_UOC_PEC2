Large bright orange cigar shaped craft.;1969-10-31 23:00:00;20minutes;Large bright orange cigar shaped craft. we were just outside Fulton,NY when I looked into the sky and saw a bright orange cigar shaped object moving slowly from north to south. My friend also saw this when I told him to look at this object. The object stopped and a piece of the same color fell from the craft. I watched it fall and all of a sudden the piece burst into flames. The craft then took off in the same direction it came from. It seemed to very large and slow moving. We wish to remain unknown as to this event. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.3211;-76.4033999999997
Clear round sphere's about the size of a soccer ball or larger floated slowly by;1970-06-01 17:00:00;5 minutes;clear round sphere's about the size of a soccer ball or larger floated slowly by It was a hot summer's day , my sister and I were behind the shed sneaking a smoke when all of sudden two round balls that were about a foot wide floated slowly past us. The best way I can describe this was like the ball that floated on the Wizard of Oz that had the good witch Glenda in it. We lived out in the country at the time. there is no swamp near us. I had the feeling it was something that had control to it. We watch it for about 5 min. untill we could no longer see them.  We ran in the house and told our father and he said it was just probably swamp gas? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.3211;-76.4033999999997
