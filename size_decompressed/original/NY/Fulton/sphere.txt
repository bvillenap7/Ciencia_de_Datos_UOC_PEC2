5 men witness floating orange sphere while smoking cigarettes by a field.;2008-07-26 00:00:00;4 minutes;5 men witness floating orange sphere while smoking cigarettes by a field. Four friends and i were out behind my house smoking ciggarettes.  we have a large field behind our house with large trees in the middle of the field.  at about midnight we saw what apeared to be a low flying aircraft.  Helicoters frequently fly over the field behind our house so we figured it was a helicopter.  After about 20 seconds from when my friend said that it was a helicopter my other friend said that it couldnt be a helicopter it wasnt making any sound.  what we where seeing was a orange/yellowish sphere floating about 100 feet from us in the field when it went behind the trees in the middle of the field and the light went out.  I personaly do not know what that light was but it changed the way i look at life. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));43.3211;-76.4033999999997
Formation of silvery orbs spotted over Fulton NY daytime UFO sighting;2017-02-02 16:00:00;2-3 minutes;Formation of silvery orbs spotted over Fulton NY daytime UFO sighting February 2nd 2017, 4PM.  I was driving Northbound entering the intersection of S. Second Street and Oneida Street.  I was turning left so I was 3 cars back and waiting for the light to turn green.  Above the traffic light I saw 3 silvery white orbs, very distinct against a dark gray background.  There was a huge lake affect snow cloud building over Lake Ontario and it was a very solid very dark gray sky.  They were moving in small, very tight circles. I thought they could be birds but I looked left and the birds over the river were moving totally different.  So I said to myself, I'd believe they really are UFO's if they start to multiply. And just then 4 or 5 more blinked into existence to the right of the original 3. As the light was about to change and I was to begin turning left, I thought if they should all disappear, then I will believe this is a real UFO sighting.  Damned if they didn't start blinking out one at a time quickly as the light changed. I kept watching as I turned the corner but they wer! e all gone. I came home and searched for any daytime UFO viewings over Fulton and didn't find any.;43.3211;-76.4033999999997
