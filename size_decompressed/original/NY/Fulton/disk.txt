We looked up and saw a disc shaped object which hovered over us close enough for us to see a silvery metal disc with different colored lighting around the bottom of the craft.  The craft made no noticeable noise .  we were frightened and took off on our bikes. Within seconds of taking off on our bikes the craft completely and soundlessly disapeared. I can't remember it rotating or anything , it just seemed to hover for the moments that we looked at it and then it was gone . ((NUFORC Note:  Date and time above are approximate, and we have assigned an arbitrary date in the '70's..  We will invite the witness to try to establish a more accurate date.

Spinning Bright lights over fulton, ny  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2009-11-12 03:00:00;30 minutes;Spinning Bright lights over fulton, ny The object I saw was so bright it came through my curtains which happen to be very thick. The lights were red, green, blue, and the color of the object was a dull gray. It was spinning and it was about 4 miles away. It would have been about the same size as a small cell phone if it was only my arms length out. It wasn't moving left or right or up or down, and it looked like it was getting closer because it got brighter every second. And right before i saw it i heard a very loud high pitched screeching noise. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));43.3211;-76.4033999999997
