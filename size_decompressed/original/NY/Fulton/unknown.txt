dancing star?? in morning sky...;2011-11-04 04:30:00;hour;dancing star?? in morning sky... I have to wake up at 4:00 am every morning to get my husband off to work.  Was on my enclosed back porch, which faces east,  smoking a cigarette and saw an orange ball drop from the sky.  As I was looking in the direction that the ball fell, I noticed that a star, or what I thought was a star, start dancing around in the sky. It shot back and forth, rocked back and forth like a cradle, did circles in the sky.   The light was white, but every so often a red light would blink.  This started on Friday morning and I have seen it for the third morning straight now. It is too far in the sky for me to make out what it is.  No chopper sounds, no jet sounds.  I have not seen another orange ball drop from it again.   I am up every morning at the same time. Never sleep in on the weekends and I have NEVER saw this before.   The location is where the first star is at in the night sky. Venus?   It has lasted for an hour to an hour and half each of the three mornings.  I had my husband come out and look at it on the first morning to make sure I was seeing what I was seeing.;43.3211;-76.4033999999997
Warbling flashing object spotted slowly moving across Fulton sky;2014-09-08 23:00:00;15 minutes;Warbling flashing object spotted slowly moving across Fulton sky Witnessed a flashing light above the tops of the trees. At first glance I thought it was my favorite star flashing and warbling. Then realized it was too close to be a star but too far to be a plane or helicopter, as well as not really moving like a plane or like a satellite. It appeared to be rotating in an odd way, sort of warbling as it slowly dropped below the tree line diagonally to the right of its original location. It was flashing red yellow and white lights or reflecting something but no pattern could be discerned. Appeared to be drifting across the sky about as slow as watching the hands of a clock.;43.3211;-76.4033999999997
