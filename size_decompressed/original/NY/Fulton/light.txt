Fast moving bright lights over south of Fulton, followed til vanished.;2016-07-25 01:25:00;~5 minutes;Fast moving bright lights over south of Fulton, followed til vanished. I was driving south on Bankrupt Road.  I saw bright lights (2-3) in the sky and I thought it was a plane or helicopter.   I keep driving and I notice the intensity of the lights are very bright and the craft is moving fast.  I picked up speed, creeping towards 60mph.   I noticed it was quickly headed towards the horizon.  I started faster towards 48, hoping to see it.   It sunk behind a tree line so I gunned it to the next open field.  In the 5 seconds it took, the UFO had already sunk below the horizon.  This event took maybe 5 minutes, tops.   I rolled my window down and turned off the radio to check for any noise.  None.;43.3211;-76.4033999999997
