3 lights obsereved over nys thruway while helicopters persued.;2010-09-18 18:00:00;10 min;3 lights obsereved over nys thruway while helicopters persued. While waiting in traffic on the NYS thruway due to a documented crash that killed 6 members of a church my friend and I looked up and saw three lights.  It was still daylight so whatever it was that produced the light must of had a lot of energy.  These three lights began to act irratically judging the distance to be at least a mile away I'd say they were going from one side of the sky to at least 5 football fields over in a matter of seconds.  Due to the horrific crash there were at least 2 helicopters covering the scene.  They could have been news choppers but they were black.  As the lights flew around the choppers it seemed like the choppers were trying to follow and make sense of the ufo's.  after bouncing around in the sky one of the lights became brighter and appeared to go from a standstill into full speed with no acceleration time on chopper tried to follow as it left the light returned to its similar associates.  Then about ten min after first noti! cing the anomolies the lights circled one another and just as the other one had burst into full speed before all three proceeded to exit though fast their line of exit was not straight up but probably at a 60 to 70 degree angle assuming the horizon is zero.  The helicopters followed furthuring my assumtion that they were not their for the crash.  Maybe the lights led the drivers eyes of the church van away and thats why they crashed.  There were also documented sightings of these lights in ny city around the same time my friend and I saw the ufo's I am a 25 y/o male with some college and 20/20 vision.  My friend Is a 26 y/o male with a college degree 20/20 vision and this is the first encounter either of us expierienced;40.8166;-73.4713
