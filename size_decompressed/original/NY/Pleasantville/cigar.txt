cigar shaped object, very large and traveling very fast;2001-11-11 23:20:00;4 or 5 secs;cigar shaped object, very large and traveling very fast I was looking at the sky while my dogs got their nightly exercise.  Very dim lights traveling across the sky caught my peripheral vision.  There were 4 or 5 of them that seemed to come from a long object traveling very quickly from North to South at about 60 deg from horiz.  It was silent.  I could see the lights for 4 or 5 seconds then lost it in the glare from the Ford dealership lights.;41.1341;-73.7831
