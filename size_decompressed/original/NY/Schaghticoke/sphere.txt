As I was driving, out of nowhere, a large bright ball passed from left to right in the sky in front of me.  It wasn't up very high.  There was no sound.  There was no trail of any kind.  It moved in a straight line and disappeared over a line of trees.  Very fascinating to say the least;42.9173;-73.6119
