2 lights hovering over Pine Bush;2010-12-08 20:35:00;2 minutes;2 lights hovering over Pine Bush Two lights hovering directly above town (my home is NE of the center of town).  One was of slightly higher altitude on the east than the other.  They stood hovering for a moment then the one of higher altitude rose into the sky and disappeared, shortly after the other light went dim and disappeared as well.;41.6181;-74.3266
Bright light 2-3 miles away with rapid-cycling colored lights;2019-08-19 23:00:00;5-10 minutes;Bright light 2-3 miles away with rapid-cycling colored lights Date:  August 19, 2019  Time:  approx. 23:00 EST  Location:  Ulster County, NY, low in the sky between Burlingham, NY, and Walker Valley, NY, Sighting area: about 10 mins West of Pine Bush, NY, looking West  Sighting duration 5-10 mins. Description:  Seen just above the tree tops at a distance of approx. 2-3 miles, a bright flashing light, rapidly changing colors.  Larger and brighter than a star, and not flashing regular FAA  lights (as I observed the object a normal plane did fly overhead for contrast). Lots of stars out, too, but this looked nothing like a star.   Mediocre quality iPhone video taken that, at least, shows the rapid cycling of the flashing lights.  Viewed through binoculars, however, the distant object almost appeared spherical, and the different colored rapid-cycling lights were much more obvious.  The object appeared motionless until it drifted away south and was gone from view behind tall trees nearby.;41.6181;-74.3266
