Orange orbs seen flying across the sky on Dec.25, 2012 in Pine Bush, N.Y.;2012-12-25 21:00:00;15 minutes;Orange orbs seen flying across the sky on Dec.25, 2012 in Pine Bush, N.Y. Our strange sightings started out Christmas evening at about 8:15 p.m. heading west towards Pine Bush, N.Y. on 17K.  About five minutes before we reached Pine bush I yelled to my daughter to look at the falling star coming from the North ( left side of us).   I slowed down to view this with her.  It appeared really big and was glowing really bright blue at the tip and around the sides and out of the back.  We thought for sure it would crash and catch something on fire.  We waited and heard and saw nothing after it was out of our range of view.   Later that evening  at approximately 9:30 p.m. my daughter and I were driving East on 17K through Pine Bush, N.Y. when we saw about 15 dark orange orbs flying  in a diagonal pattern across the sky starting above the tree line. We pulled over to the side of the road and opened the windows and heard absolutely no sound coming from them. We dismissed them from being helicopters or another form of aircraft by the way they wer! e almost hovering in the sky traveling slowly in an upwards diagonal  without any sound being emitted. They were traveling from north to south in staggered pairs of 2 and 3 orbs with almost an even space between them. Once they seemed to get to a certain height they began to travel along a horizontal path across the sky in front of us and then one by one they began to just disappear at the exact same point. We watched the very last one and did not take our eyes off of it the entire time and sure enough the same thing happened. I then drove down a bit on 17K hoping to see any trace or perhaps there was an obstruction or cloud hiding them. Unfortunately, these orbs seemed to just vanish. I don't know if these two occurrences were related but I can't help to think they were.;41.6181;-74.3266
