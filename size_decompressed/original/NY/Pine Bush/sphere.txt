Red/orange orb seen hovering over trees lighting the tips of said trees before vanishing in motion to the left. Pine Bush NY 1998;1998-07-16 22:00:00;20 seconds;Red/orange orb seen hovering over trees lighting the tips of said trees before vanishing in motion to the left. Pine Bush NY 1998 In Pine Bush NY on West Searsville Road I was among a number of Sky watchers in attendance where a number of sightings were made that evening.   I was looking towards a row of trees about sixty yards away when I saw an orb of red orange light hover over the tips of the evergreen trees on the ridge near the road.  The orb shed light on the tops of the trees below it.  I estimate the size of the orb to be five feet in diameter.   It hovered over the trees moving slowly from right to left and then zipped out of sight after moving there for fifteen seconds.   This particular sighting was verified by two other people at the location. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));41.6181;-74.3266
