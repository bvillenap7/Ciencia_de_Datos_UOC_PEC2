Black triangle with red lights very up close sighting with 3 witnesses, Red Mill Rd. in Pine Bush NY.;2001-06-30 23:00:00;10 minutes;Black triangle with red lights very up close sighting with 3 witnesses, Red Mill Rd. in Pine Bush NY. My best friend and I were taking 2 friends home, it was me and him and the 2 young ladies. We are driving on North St. approaching Red Mills Rd. in Pine Bush right before the curve heading towards the town park we see a light and we joke about a UFO. As we get closer the light is different, not like a plane at all which we are used to seeing because of a good deal of air traffic from time to time so we are used to seeing planes and the lights they have. I  tell my friend to go straight onto Dubois instead of staying on North which turns into Red Mills Rd. and from there we turn left onto Edwards Rd. where the object is getting closer. At where Red Mills Rd. and Edwards Rd. meet we stop the car and all get out as the object is low and is going overhead. It is your typical black triangle with red lights, dead silent, not more than a 1000 ft. it seemed above our heads and moving very slowly. It traveled slowly south east and slowly disappeared. It is something I will never forget just like the encounter I had in the late 80s in Ellenville, NY. I have had other experiences so to speak as I lived in Walker Valley NY which is in between Ellenville and Pine Bush on Rte. 52, one experience was a feeling of paralysis when I was laying in bed one night and then as if I were laying in bed I was very high up in the sky floating above Rte. 52 looking down at homes at night heading in the direction of Pine Bush, possible dream or something else I just do not know.
