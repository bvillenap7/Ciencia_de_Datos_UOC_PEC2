PD));2017-01-18 17:00:00;60 minutes;At 1700 hours, while exiting a cab, I witnessed a bright light with a halo of lights going around and around that blinked in sequence.  I asked someone in the area to look up and tell me what did they see.  They told me it was an unusual light.  Together, we stared at the light as it stood still in the same position.  The passbyer entered her car and drove off.  I went inside Dollar tree off of Raleigh Road Parkway, a few doors down from Walmart Shopping Mall, to go look up and tell me what she saw.   After observing it for a few minutes, she said it looked like a star or maybe a plane.  I asked the female supervisor at the Dollar Tree to go look outside and tell me what she saw when she looked up in the sky.  There were no stars out and she said it was just a bright light or maybe a plane.  I proceeded to shop inside Dollar Tree and was at the register at 1745.  My cab driver was awaiting out front and I asked him to look up and tell me what he saw.  He looked up at the light for a few minutes and said he saw a bright light with lights blinking around it, rotating.  I got in the cab and rode home.;43.2939;-78.8233
