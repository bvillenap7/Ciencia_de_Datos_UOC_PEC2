While driving down the road on the way home my girlfriend and i saw an incredibly bright white teardrop shaped extraterrestrial space craft with a bright platinum blue and red trail fly across the sky and upward towards space at an incredibly unbelievably fast speed for about four seconds and then blinked out as if it completely instantly disappeared.  This was not the same way that shooting stars exist, this craft was large with a large trail and was very distinct and recognizable.;42.1096;-79.4066
