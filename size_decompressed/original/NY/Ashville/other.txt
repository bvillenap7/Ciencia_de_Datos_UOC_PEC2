Orange round ball of light.;2015-10-15 04:00:00;30 minutes;Orange round ball of light. I had to let the dogs outside about 4am.  In my mud room on my house, I have a back door for the dog pen and a front one to go outside to the driveway.  I had let the dogs outside using the back door and noticed all the stars in the sky that morning.   I wanted to look at more stars and decided to go to the front door and look at the stars on that side.  Upon opening the door I noticed a round orange glowing light just over my neighbor's house and the trees right behind them.  I have looked in the night sky in the same direction many times, so I know for a fact there is nothing in that direction to cause the light.   It hovered for about half hour and in a blink of an eye it was gone.  I know what I seen and it can not be explained.;42.1096;-79.4066
