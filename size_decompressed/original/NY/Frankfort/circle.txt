Flashing lights in Central NY sky;2009-07-10 02:30:00;2 Hours;Flashing lights in Central NY sky My cousin was sitting on the front porch when he witnessed some blinking lights in the sky and called me outside to observe them.  In the northeastern part of the sky there was a circular object which seemed to be flashing many lights that were red, white, blue and green in color. The object started low in the sky and rose as time passed by.  After further sky watching we were able to see to more of these objects flashing the same type of lights.  All three if the objects rose in the sky and seemed to get farther away as time passed by. We watched the objects for a couple of hours travel farther from us. The next night my cousin once again checked the sky to see if the objects would appear again and all three objects were again visible the next night. We are unsure of what these lights could be and can't find many answers with online research thus far.;43.044;-75.1072
