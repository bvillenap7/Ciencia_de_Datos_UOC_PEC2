Multicolored disk across the street.;1993-08-10 21:00:00;30 seconds;Multicolored disk across the street. I was five at the time that I saw the craft, so memories of the incident are hazy. I was in my house when I decided to walk around, there was nothing to do. My house has a small room in which people take off their coats and shoes and put them away, the entryroom. I walked into the entryroom and approached the window to the side of the door. The windows are tall and thin and are to the sides of the door, and have a white lace-like cloth over them. I pushed the curtains asid to see any traffic. There's a tool factory in front of my house across to street, with a small wooded section blocking the factory's veiw. In a large central brak in the wooded section is where a disk shaped craft slowly crpt into veiw. The craft had multicolored lights to its side, which didn't seem to shine like a beacon, yet there was a definite shine to them. The craft, as it was disk shaped, had a side to it where the lights were atached, streching all around the craft. The craft did swirl a bit, and I can remember a soft beeping noise, like when you dial-up onto the internet. After about twenty-five, thirty seconds, the carft dirfted the west, where i wasn't able to see the craft agian, do to the width of the window. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
