Thought it was plane at first, but it emoted no sound nor flashing light.;2010-09-10 21:00:00;2 minutes;Thought it was plane at first, but it emoted no sound nor flashing light. A lone , bright white light in a clear evening sky which when viewed through binoculors seems to reflect the glowing round craft it is emoting from. It traveled east over Utica, NY, into the Mohawk Valley, pausing only momentarily just outside of Utica then proceeding slowly into the Mohawk Valley.  Once, it travels just past Frankfort, NY it begins to gradually pick up speed and then in the blink of an eye and like hitting warp speed it shoots out past the Valley like a bullet being shot out of a gun barrel.;43.044;-75.1072
