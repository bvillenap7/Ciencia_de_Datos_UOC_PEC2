Strange lights seen flying low in the NYC metro-area;2005-12-05 00:25:00;approx. 30 seconds;Strange lights seen flying low in the NYC metro-area I was throwing out trash behind my house. I looked up and saw this object only several hundred feet above me in the air. At first first i took it to be a helicopter as seen from directly below however the Red, Blue and White-yellow lights struck me as odd. They did not blink and were very bright making it difficult to distinguish anything about the shape of the craft which would have blended into the night sky in the absence of light. However i believe it may have been tear drop shaped or perhaps something akin to a triangle with smoothed edges.The craft moved very quickly over my location and dissappeared on the otherside of an apt. building. The oddest thing about the sighting which makes me discount a plane or helicopter was the absence of any sound. This object made no noise. No hum or anything. It was deadly quiet and very fast. Growing up in the city near both major airports I am accustomed to seeing helicopters and planes flying low. I normally don't even look twice but something was very different about this craft. It was very unsettling. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.726;-73.848
