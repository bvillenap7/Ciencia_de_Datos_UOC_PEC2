4 bright, round lights hovering above me.;2013-04-01 22:00:00;3 minutes;4 bright, round lights hovering above me. I saw 4 objects which appeared as lights, round, bright from 1/2 block away, it was about 10:00 PM. The street was empty.  There was no sound.   As I approached them, they appeared to hover above my head, maybe several feet above me.   As I walked they followed me in formation, 2 and 2.   As I ran, they kept up with me, I was too afraid to look above me and ran into my building. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
