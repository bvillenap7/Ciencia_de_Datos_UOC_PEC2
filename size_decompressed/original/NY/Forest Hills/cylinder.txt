Cylindrical air craft firing red lights.;2010-11-01 18:00:00;1 minute;Cylindrical air craft firing red lights. In what was around October of 2010, a cylindrical aircraft (which looked like no plane I had ever seen before) was flying in the sky above Forest Hills Queens.  It slowed down and fired what looked like 2 red lights which were on the front of the ship very rapidly.  It seemed like they were being fired at me.  After firing or flashing the red lights, the plane continued moving.  I never saw this, or anything like it again.;40.726;-73.848
