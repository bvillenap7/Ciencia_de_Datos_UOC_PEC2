The disk was bright red and moving north in a slow linear direction towards LaGuardia Airport some 5 miles away from my location  It then turned left quite quickly I could see that the disk had gained altitude towards Manhattan Island moving in a non-linear fashion at very high speed. During its movement towards Manhattan the diskâ€™s bright red color (apparent dome shape) maintained its brightness while it appeared that  the saucer was translucent with  its edge  ringed by non-flashing white lights which became evident  while changing its flight mode and position   It then continued to gain altitude quickly while moving north and disappearing.;40.726;-73.848
