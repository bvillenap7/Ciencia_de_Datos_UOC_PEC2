Cigar-shaped object sighted in NY;2009-09-14 23:00:00;5 seconds;Cigar-shaped object sighted in NY The object was moving across the sky and I just happened to walk outdoors and look at the right moment. The sky was completely clear and many stars were visible. The object appeared to be a cigar-like shape. I could only make out the outline. It was as if the sun was shining directly on the surface of the object. The color was completely different than the colr of the stars (it was more gold like the sun). The object was not making any noise. It was difficult to estimate its altitude, but if I had to guess it may have been between 300 - 1000 feet. It appeared to be about 6 inches long from my viewpoint. Then after a few seconds, as if it had detected that it was being watched, it's outline shimmered and then disappeared just like a sci-fi cloaking device had been activated. I have a good idea what a civilian and military aircraft looks like in the night sky, because I see them all of the time, but this object was clearly not anything normal. It was also not ! a meteor in my opinion. It definitely made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.;43.0467;-76.6452
