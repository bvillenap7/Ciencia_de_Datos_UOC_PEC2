4-5 Objects flying over NY.;2014-07-04 21:30:00;5-15 minutes;4-5 Objects flying over NY. I saw 4-5 yellow red orange object in the sky, I thought first it was plane or something, but they were too close to each other to be air plane, and they were to slow. it happened when my papa jones pizza delivery here, I asked the guy, is that air plane, he said I dont think so, I thought it was just some nature lighting reflections, so I joke with him said maybe its UFO, then later my girl friend went out, the lights still there in the sky, we didnt take a picture, because it was too small to cap in my phone, I live in oakland gardens NY state.
