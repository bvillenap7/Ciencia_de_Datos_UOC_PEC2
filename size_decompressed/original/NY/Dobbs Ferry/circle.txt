Flashing white orb 1 second on 8-12 seconds off 30,000 ft elevation.;2020-04-21 22:30:00;3 minutes;Flashing white orb 1 second on 8-12 seconds off 30,000 ft elevation. I saw what appeared to be a white/blue luminate object around 20-30,000 ft up. It had the appearance of a star. However, would blink on for one second, then off for 8-12 seconds. All while maintain altitude but shifting from one location to the next. I counted one Mississippi in between links and confirmed the light on was 1 second duration. Light off was random 8-12 seconds;41.0155;-73.8635
