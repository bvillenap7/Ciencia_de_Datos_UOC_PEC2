Blue headlights in the sky;2009-08-13 01:30:00;1min.;Blue headlights in the sky As I was leaving my friend's house at 1:30am I observed an unusual phenomenon.  About three miles away from where I was, on his porch, there was a bright (almost as if it was a headlight) blue sphere in the sky.  It was probably two football field lengths distance away from the top of the houses.  It was foggy out at that time so I could not make out specific details of the object but the fog had a blue haze from the sphere.  I'm not speculating whether or not it came from Mars, but it was a very odd event to witness.  After about one minute the sphere immediately disappeared and the blue haze with it, although the fog remained.  It left me feeling a little nutty because the object was so bright and had form to it and then it was like you blinked and nothing was ever there.

Hilton NY 3 spheres;2020-12-15 20:35:00;2 minutes;Hilton NY 3 spheres I was heading North into the village of Hilton and from just past Burritt Rd.(1/2 mile from village) I could see above the village 3 spherical objects. All looked to be the same size. One was higher than the other two and had a reddish hue. The two below were situated offset from one another and weâ€™re a very bright white. As I turned onto my road a top the hill, the highest reddish sphere moved directly up and to the west very rapidly(Lost visual). Then I began to take video via camera-phone and the remaining two objects cruised directly over me (heading south) to the point where I could see the bottom exterior. No defined shape, looked almost wavy. Absolutely no sound. (Camera footage too dark to see, may attempt edit.  8:35 pm;43.2912000000001;-77.7894
