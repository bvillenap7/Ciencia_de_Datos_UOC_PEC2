Bright moving lights above Southern Shore Of Lake Ontario, 12:45 am 5/18/14;2014-05-18 00:45:00;25 minutes;Bright moving lights above Southern Shore Of Lake Ontario, 12:45 am 5/18/14 5 miles South of Lake Ontario...I was driving North and saw a very bright yellowish light, I thought it was a plane, but it would have been either very large, or very close.  As I was driving North, it kept getting lower and lower and I'm thinking, it's going to either land or crash.  As I turned and started heading East, I saw another one...as I was driving about 55, It appeared to be moving to the east also, but that could have been an optical illusion as it was so large.  There appeared to be smoke trails following it.  I arrived at my destination and walked around the side of the building where another customer approached me and asked if I was ok...I pointed to the sky. We could see 2 of the very large bright lights, and as we watched the surrounding sky was turning different shades of pale red.  After I came out of the store and started heading North again, I noticed a group of people in  a parking lot watching one and taking pictures. I stopped and asked if we were getting invaded and they were like...maybe...I drove home heading West and saw 2 of them...one got  lower and lower and finally went out, but the other appeared to be traveling West. I arrived home and looked North and could one through the trees.  I ran inside for my camera, but when I got back it was gone.  Walked to the end of the road and the other was gone too. I saw this at 12:45 am - 1:10 am.;43.2912000000001;-77.7894
