While walking dog I noticed the craft in between trees.  It was oval and hovering and it was oval in shape. It had green, white, and blue lights that were flashing in a rotation format at first.  I watched for a few minutes and after it started to get lower to a group of trees next to our property, I ran inside to tell my husband.  He came out to the yard. He too saw the lights and the hovering.  Then we noticed 3 more crafts.  Then two more for a total of 6.  It appeared that the crafts were communicating with each other and they were flashing lights at each other.  The lights would change color.  At one point it would be blue or white then turn red.  They def were not planes as they would hover and then dart up and down or side to side extremely fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
