It seemed still but when I recorded it on my phone it was moving very fast back and forth.  I went back outside an hour later it was across the street over the cow pasture.  Each time it was very high in the sky.  But you can tell it was large to see it from the ground. The next night it returned.  I watched it slowly rise straight up into the sky.  When I recorded it again there were burst of light around it.  Both times red and green flashes.;43.4574;-76.2472
