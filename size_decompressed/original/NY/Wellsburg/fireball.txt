Silent ball of light, turned and disappeared followed by a flash of light in the sky.;2009-07-22 22:20:00;5 seconds;Silent ball of light, turned and disappeared followed by a flash of light in the sky. My daughter and I witnessed a bright white round light make a left bank turn and then disappear solid black.  It lasted only 5 seconds.  The object was traveling away from us, so I assume the light was on the bottom of the aircraft.  Five minutes later, we also witnessed one bright flash in the sky.  We can't explain and don't know where it came from.  Flash originated from behind us in a clear blue sky.  Sky was clear, but clouded up 30 minutes later.  We were on a country back road. I took my daughter here because when I was a kid in the late 1970's there was alot of UFO activity there, and she didn't believe me.;42.0303;-76.7687
