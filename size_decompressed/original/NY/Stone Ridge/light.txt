strange lights in field sound similar to another area sighting;1994-10-20 22:00:00;3-4 minutes;strange lights in field sound similar to another area sighting I was just recently browsing through your files and came across a sighting on 10/20/94and it immediatly reminded me of an encounter I had while working as night dispatcher for a major local oil company. Any way one of the service men called over the radio that he was stopped on lucas ave. about 3/4 of a mile south of rosendale elementary school and that he and about 5 or6 other people were watching these mullti colered lights in the corn field next to the road . the lights lasted for 2 to 3 minutes before completely disappearing without a trace. i dont believe the serviceman was pulling my chain due to the fact of the tone in his voice and the voices of the others that the mic picked up when he was transmitting.  incedently this location cant be more than 3miles in a straight line to the other sighting in stone ridge on 10/20/94;41.8616;-74.1684
