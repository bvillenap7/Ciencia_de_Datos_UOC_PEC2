Bright flash of light that changed color then exploded in mid-air with a shower of sparks;2005-07-30 23:29:00;3 seconds;Bright flash of light that changed color then exploded in mid-air with a shower of sparks Traveling west on Rt. 9, from Keeseville, NY to Ausable Forks, NY on Saturday, July 30th 2005.   This area is very rural.  Sky was dark and clear, dont remember much of a moon.   At about 11:29pm eastern my attention was drawn to a streak of light in the sky.  It was very white, bright and fast, low to the horizon but above the tree line, descending almost perpendicular to the ground (perhaps a slight North/South tilt).  It seemed very wide for a meteor flash.  The streak terminated barely above the treeline, but exhibited some unusual behavior.  In the last second it changed from a whitish light to a deep emerald green hue, utterly lovely, and then exploded in a shower of golden sparks.   It looked for all the world like a lance of light that struck something in the sky which then exploded.  It was silent as far as I can tell, there was no boom after the streak terminated.;44.5035;-73.473
