I was sitting on my front porch looking up into the sky to see if it was a clear night when I saw a bright blue/white circle shaped flash. It flashed onces, there was a tiny pause then flashed again one last time. I did not see any tail to indicate that it was a meteor and I did not see any aircraft, but there were no more flashes. The odd thing was that there were more planes out tonight that I've seen since I've been here heading in the same direction as the bright light.;42.7497;-76.8449
