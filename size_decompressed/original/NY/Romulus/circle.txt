Saw to different circular objects. The first one was seen flying below several planes, but there was no visible propulsion or wings to the craft. That lasted for roughly two minutes before disappearing. The second one was about three minutes after. Again, it was also located below the flying planes. No sound could be heard, no visible propulsion yet again, and no wings. Lasted for roughly two minutes, about the same as the last time before also disappearing as well. Could've been a drone, but I don't think it was below 400 feet.;42.7497;-76.8449
