Not as an airplane, we've seen those often around here, but of something irregular.  The flight pattern was stagnent. It hovered for about 5 mins, then eratically set off. it didn't fly in a straight line. It zigzagged.  the lights on the object were white, spaced unevenly.  The light was emmitted in a pulse tone sequence, going off beat every now and then. My husband does not believe in UFO's.  He had witnessed the sighting the other evening with me.  he is a skeptic. I on the other hand have witnessed many sightings, since I was about 7yrs old.  I've ahd dreams of attempted abductions.  I also experience insomnia and fear of sleep at times.  It always feels as if someone is watching, sometimes, even in my room before I fall asleep.  i have awaken dozens of times in the middle of the night, my pulse rate through the roof, but I couldn't recall the dream.  I wake up scared.  I know it is them.;42.7702;-74.0788000000001
The objects we saw appeared at first to be satellites, but would change direction and drift back and forth.;2002-07-02 02:30:00;2 hours;The objects we saw appeared at first to be satellites, but would change direction and drift back and forth. My wife and I were camping, sleeping under the stars and watching the night sky when I saw a faint light moving across the sky. At first I thought it was a satellite, until it changed direction. Then I noticed there were others. They were very far apart spread across the entire sky but exhibited the same behavior, they would drift back and forth and each stayed in the same vicinity of the sky. They seemed to be very high up, occasionally they would disappear behind the clouds. Sometimes they would grow dimmer and brighter, and sometimes they would move quickly and other times stop moving completely. They were too far away to tell if there was more than one light on each, the light appeared to be white. We watched them until about 4 AM when we fell asleep. My wife and I were both completely sober. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD));42.7702;-74.0788000000001
