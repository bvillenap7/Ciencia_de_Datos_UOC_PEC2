Oval shaped flying object in the night sky;2013-02-22 00:03:00;1 minute;Oval shaped flying object in the night sky I saw a flying object right after the midnight.  The approximate appearance was symmetrical and oval from the point of view if looking straight in the sky with several flashing/blinking lights spread horizontally of the lower part of the object.  The object was moving slowly horizontally, from North to South, at the height where helicopters fly and with the similar speed the lights were blinking or flashing interchangeably.    It moved through the part of the sky and then disappeared, either behind the cloud or it was simply gone.    It was not a helicopter, nor a plane - I observed it long enough to see the difference, and the distance allowed no confusion.   I was so taken by the sight that didn't think to try to attempt to record the event.;42.7702;-74.0788000000001
