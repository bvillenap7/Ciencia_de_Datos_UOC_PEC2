Up ahead, very high in the sky, from my vantage point looking over the roof of he neighbors house behind my house, I noticed among all the normal looking white/yellow bright stars was what looked like a star that was changing colors (red, green, white, blue).   I figured it was a plane but I then noticed the same (what I assumed was again a star) was up higher and to the right in the sky.  It looked smaller or further from Earth but it did the same thing.   So, I figured maybe they were both planes with colored lights but neither moved, they both were in the same spot for at least ten minutes or so before I decided to get a pair of my binoculars.   I went outside and looking through the binoculars, I saw that the typical white/yellow stars that we all see in the sky were just that...stars (yellow/! white in color and stationary).  When I looked at the two multi-colored &quotstars&quot one was larger than the other...they were stationary but through my binoculars I could see a strobe light effect going on and the colors were red, blue, green and white/yellow and they just constantly changed colors.   It also seemed like there was a vague outline of an orb shape enveloping the constantly changing colored strobe effect.   I don't know for sure it was a UFO (either or both) but nothing else in the sky was stationary and changing colors constantly.;40.7272;-73.2696
