Two balls of foggy light playing back and forth.;2014-08-15 22:45:00;10 minutes;Two balls of foggy light playing back and forth. I was traveling south on I-87 with my wife.  Time was approx. 22:45.  Something caught my eye and moving above us were these 2 round shaped glowing light.  I could not believe what I was seeing.   My wife also looked on and was able to get some photos.  The photos were not very clear as we were traveling and taking pictures thru the windshield.  The 2 objects appeared to be playing dancing back and forth above and in front of our vehicle.   I started to pull over, and by the time I stopped, they were gone.   Best description is someone playing with bright lights.  The objects were moving very fast and at times seem to touch.   This area is very wooded and remote. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
