Large, very bright oval shaped amber colored lights at very low altitude moving slowly across the night sky;2008-09-14 22:25:00;3 to 4 minutes;Large, very bright oval shaped amber colored lights at very low altitude moving slowly across the night sky My Wife, Son and myself were watching CNN when through the south facing window we witnessed a number of very large and very bright oval shaped amber colored lights moving slowly across the sky in a north easterly direction.  They were all at relative distance to each other not in formation, but rather part of what seemed to be a very large craft. The sky this night was very clear with lots of visible  stars, a typical fall night up here in the North Country.   My Son and I went outside to get a better look, once outside we observed no sound coming from the object which was roughly a few miles away traveling very slowly much to slow for any kind of aircraft also judging from the amount of stars that it obscured from view, its height and distance from us it was extremely large roughly perhaps twice the size of a modern day aircraft Carrier,  We observed the object for a few minutes when it increased it's speed rapidly and was gone from view in the blink of an eye. I have observed many lights and objects in the sky, but never thought that any of them could not be explained, however the object my Son and I observed this night was far to large, made no sound and moved far to slowly to be of any aircraft design I know of.;44.3847;-75.1013
