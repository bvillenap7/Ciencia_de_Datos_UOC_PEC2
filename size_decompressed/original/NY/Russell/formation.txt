Six Orange-Yellow Orbs in Horizontal Formation;2012-01-11 18:25:00;10 Seconds;Six Orange-Yellow Orbs in Horizontal Formation While driving on CR24 approximately one mile out of Russell, I noticed 6 perfectly spaced orange-yellow glowing orbs arranged in a horizontal line. The lights were to the northeast and were at about the 30 degree mark above the horizon. I asked my kids if they were seeing the lights and two of them said yes. Right after that they went out one after the other from the right to the left.;44.3847;-75.1013
