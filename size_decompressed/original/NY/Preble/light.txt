Light in the sky on rt. 81 S near Preble NY.;2009-12-06 18:57:00;5 seconds;Light in the sky on rt. 81 S near Preble NY. I was driving South on I81 from the Syracuse area. Between Preble and Homer I saw a streak of white light in front of the car entering my field of vision from the East. I imediately thought it was a meteor, but then it slowed down, directly south of me it slowed to a crawl. It appeared the size of a bright star or planet in the night sky. After a few seconds it sped up and flew off to the West. When it came in it was decending, when it flew off it was either level or slightly ascending. This event lasted aproximately 3-5 seconds, at about 6:57 pm. The object was at about 30-40 degrees up in the sky.;42.7975;-76.2099
