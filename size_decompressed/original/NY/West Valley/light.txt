the scariest thing i have ever seen.;2000-06-09 20:30:00;15 minutes;the scariest thing i have ever seen. On The night of my birthday June 9th my friends were over and we were having a fire in honer of my birthday.  we were talking for a while and then i decided to rest my eyes and watch the sun set so i was turning my head and then i paused and i saw two very little lights that were close together and the only way to tell that it was two lights is you had to have  good eyesight.  I quickly told my friends and we stared at it while it was going back and forth in a way a plane could NOT move plus the weirder thing is it was right over the demonstration project.  then about fifteen minutes later after we started staring at it the light moved towards us at a very fast vilocity and then it just totally disapeared then the next morning i went to my friends house and in his field his dog was dead it torn apart we walked a little further then we saw marks in his field very strange marks.  so then i told my parents and they cracked up and said a coyote must of gotten the dog and what we saw could of been a weather baloon. but they could not explain the marks in the field.;42.4323;-78.6271
