I have always been fascinated by space and what could possibly be out there, and tonight I saw something I cannot explain.   As I was driving home from a school event going south on Plank Rd towards Livonia, when I caught a light out of the corner of my eye.  Immediately I thought it was nothing, until it reappeared directly in front of me.  The object appeared as a perfect circle and was bright green in color with a green glow emanating around it.   As soon as I focused in on the object, it took off at speeds much greater than any aircraft I have seen and left a green streak behind it as it sped off horizontally across the sky.;42.8097;-77.6624
