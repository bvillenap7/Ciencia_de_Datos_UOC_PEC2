Larchmont, New York;2019-10-06 04:05:00;1 minute;Larchmont, New York Went outside at approximately 4:05 this morning and while I know that this is a busy area for plane I quickly noticed that the light from the “plane” wasn’t flashing as I normally see.  I stood there for a moment and watched this long, well lit, object was clearly no plain at all.  My phone was just inside the door so I went inside for litterly seconds only to return and it was completely gone.  Amazing experience for me personally.
