Invisible Space Craft exposing Super Bright Light at the bottom of craft momentarily before hyperspacing away night sky;2007-05-08 23:15:00;10 seconds;Invisible Space Craft exposing Super Bright Light at the bottom of craft momentarily before hyperspacing away night sky My co-worker and I are taxi drivers in Larchmont, NY.  We were standing by the train station platform talking while waiting for the train to come in around 11:15pm to dispatch customers.  Then suddenly my co-worker started looking hard at something in the night sky that caught his eye.  I recognized him looking up at something so I turned around and looked up myself.  We both saw a super bright light above us less than 100 stories high almost skidding to a halt or vibrating back and forth momentarily.  Then as we both looked up very hard together, it took off streaking across the night sky visibly noticeable. From my evaluation this was probably a invisible space craft that wanted to exposed a super bight light to the both of us letting us know that they were above us.  The size of this super bright light was like the size of a basketball.  When I looked up it must of been hovering above us for who knows how long.  By this craft exposing their super bright light above us as we were observing, it then took off.  The whole experience was about 20 to 30 seconds long.  The night was 100% visibly clear.  The weather was about 70 degrees.  This super bight light was easily noticable to the naked eye.;40.9355;-73.7603
