After about 30 minutes the light would dissapear and reapear in the sky a few seconds later in a distance that would have been impossible for the object to get to in that amount of time. these lights continued to appear on a nightly basis for about a week and still appear sometimes. i thought the lights were helicopters but i went outside and could not hear anything. the lights have always stayed in the same general area, which seems to be about 3 miles south of my home. i have been searching for the light s since then and i have only spotted them a few times, but i still search the sky for them when ever i get the chance.
