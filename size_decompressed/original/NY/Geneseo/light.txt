I was 21 at the time and the other witness was 18. Mid sentence one of the other actors stopped talking and started staring at something in the sky, I immediately looked up and saw what he was watching and we both followed it across the sky until it disappeared.  The object at first struck me as a low laying cloud as it was kind of hazy but it appeared to be moving quicker than most clouds would as the night was not windy.  Upon looking closer there were three rows of dull red lights.  They were shaped in a half circle.  When the object disappeared from view we heard a single noise that sounded like a goose honking but we did not see any geese in the area or in the sky. After seeing this the fellow and I stared at each other in disbelief and then described the exact same thing to each other, finishing each others sentences.  We kept an eye on the sky after that but nothing else was seen.  Neither one of us had been drinking that night or were under any other influences.  This location is in the middle of cornfields in upstate NY.;42.7956;-77.8046

All of a sudden it dropped from the sky and disappeared over the horizon.  My friend was standing right next to me.  We were amazed at what we had seen.;42.7956;-77.8046
