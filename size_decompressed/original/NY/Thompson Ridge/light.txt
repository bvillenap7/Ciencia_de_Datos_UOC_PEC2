5-6 dim white lights hovering over Thompson Ridge NY swamp;2015-04-27 05:30:00;2-3 seconds;5-6 dim white lights hovering over Thompson Ridge NY swamp Driving south down route 302 out of Pine Bush, NY, passing by Thompson Ridge, NY, 5:30am this morning just before dawn, saw hovering just above treetops 5 or 6 dim white lights closely spaced and tilted at a slight angle to the ground.   No flashing FAA lights.  Hovering over an uninhabited large swampy area just south of Thompson Ridge.  One large craft or 5-6 small ones?   Was in sight for 2-3 seconds, pulled out my phone to take video as I was driving, my view was obscured for a split second by a couple of trees, and when I next looked the lights had vanished.;41.5748;-74.3196
