((anonymous report));2017-06-27 13:30:00;10 minutes;I heard a big jet going over, so I looked up.  As i did i saw a bright shiny object near the plane alt.   We got our binoculars out and still could not make shape.  Appeared stationary, then made fast horizontal movement and disappeared.    I have reported from this area before of amber lights at night.  Same craft but daytime???   By the way this is in the Norway-Nelson Road area.  Approx 1 mi. south of the St. Lawrence River.
