An orange spherical light hovered in the southern sky. It was large and out of place, not significantly higher than the treeline. 2 smaller lights were then emitted in order from smallest first to largest last, which formed an angled formation, the original light being the largest and highest. I would approximate the formation to be a 30 degree line. The lights formed this line from west to east.  Then, the lights melded back into the larger, original light in reverse order and it disappeared. Altitude and size is difficult to estimate. The initial sighting to its disappearance was around 15 seconds. I can draw no conclusions as to the nature of this event.;44.7198;-75.2643
