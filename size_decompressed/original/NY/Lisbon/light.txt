Red moving object that had no noise and vanished.;2014-09-07 16:20:00;4 minutes;Red moving object that had no noise and vanished Was outside and saw a red light in the sky coming towards me.  I noticed it was lower than a plane and had no noise at all.   Called my brother and he went out and saw it also.  It then changed direction and then vanished.   During this time all the dogs around were going nuts also.  I have never seen anything like it in my life.;44.7198;-75.2643
