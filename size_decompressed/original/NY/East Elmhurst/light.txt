2 bright lights, not moving seem relatively close, wish someone would confirm.  ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter and Saturn.  PD));2012-03-11 21:00:00;Non stop;2 bright lights, not moving seem relatively close, wish someone would confirm Two lights in the sky and aren't moving. I see stars and compared to the stars they are much closer and brighter.  Couldn't tell what it is with binoculars. My friend said he saw them last night also.  They can be seen facing the West from my point.  Anyone know what the hell are these they aren't planes or helicopters and they don't flash just steady light ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter and Saturn.
