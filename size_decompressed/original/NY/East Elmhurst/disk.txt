Then another appeared but it was to late when my camera was out because the tree and my neighbor's house blocked my view. I left my camera on anyways and caught another object that hovered over my neighbor's house then it disappeared behind it. This one was dark and shadowy in appearance, nunlike the other two I saw that were gray, shiney, and disk shaped. After this I was wanted to see more, but all I could find were helicopters and air plaines.  The one I caught on tape can be found on youtube. It was originally 2 seconds long, but I put it in extremely slow motion. http://www.youtube.com/my_videos_edit?video_id=QosspheM9kQ;40.7626;-73.8923
