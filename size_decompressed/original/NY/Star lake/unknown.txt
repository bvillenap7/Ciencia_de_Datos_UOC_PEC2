Unexplained flashing lights over Star Lake, NY;2009-03-17 20:35:00;1 minute;Unexplained flashing lights over Star Lake, NY My brother-in-law and I were coming home from the convenient store and I had seen a strange light in the sky. I didn’t know what it was, so I didn’t respond immediately to it, but kept an eye on it. The light was big enough to notice but the trees were making the light indistinguishable. As we continued to drive home, I then saw the lights much more clearly. There were four huge circular lights, each light being bigger than that of a streetlight, flashing - then would disappear, then one huge circular light would appear and disappear, then four more huge lights would appear, then disappear…and the cycle of circular flashing lights continued in that pattern: four then one. They continued to flash and move at a steady pace toward the south. My brother-in-law was amazed at what he saw and yelled, What is that? Neither of us knew for sure what we were seeing.  I had moved slowly down the road observing it, and then stopped completely in the middle of the road to observe this odd and unique sight.  After about one minute it just disappeared out of sight.  This was my first sighting ever of something in the sky unexplainable.  If you would have asked me about UFOs before last night, I would have been a complete skeptic.  Neither of us can explain what it was that we saw last evening.  We just know it was definitely an Unidentified Flying Object coming from the north and traveling south.;44.158;-75.0364
