Starlike objects;1975-01-17 18:00:00;10 minutes;Starlike objects It was a cold evening. Several friends and I were sledding on the hills behind our neighborhood. It was after dark. A friend mentioned that the stars in the sky were &quotmoving&quot. I looked up. And, indeed, half a dozen point sources of light were moving randomly in the Western sky. The moved up and down and side to side. At first, I thought that they must be helicopters. But there was no sound from the objects and I couldn't imagine why half a dozen helicopters would be flitting around the January sky in such a hap hazard fashion. We watched this display for a few minutes. Then, collectively, we got creep out and called it a day on the slopes. I headed in for a bowl of my Mom's home made chicken soup and tried to put the UFOs out of my mind. I have no explanation for what we saw that night.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
Bright Light;1975-06-10 22:00:00;One Minute;A friend and I stepped out onto my parents front porch. Our attention was immediately caught by a large, bright light in the North Eastern sky.  The light was very bright and about the size of a basketball held at arm's length.  At first, we thought it might be a helicopter search light. We noticed that there was no sound coming from the object. My friend and I dashed back into the house to get my Dad. When the three of us returned to the porch the light was gone.  I might have dismissed this sighting, but the next day in the Albany Times Union there was a report of a UFO matching the description of what we had seen over Albany.  The event had been viewed by dozens of witnesses.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
Search lights??with no apparent origin from ground.;1998-12-03 18:30:00;unknown;Search lights??with no apparent origin from ground. Early evening my daughter arrived at my house at 6:30pm. She called me out to see what appeared to be grand opening spot lights but there was no beam from the ground and no such local event. My granddaughter and I came out and the 3 of us thought it looked like a spinning disc that may have been up to a mile wide above the thin cloud cover. There appeared to be 4 individual lights evenly spaced that were moving in a circular pattern one time around then moved toward the center and appeared to cross over each other then back out to the perimeter and circled around again in a repeating pattern. We watched for about 5 minutes then went back inside.When my daughter checked again around 8:30pm they were gone. Had it been a grand opening it would have been still going on. We were not going to report this, but I recieved an E-mail from caus.org about Dec.7 or 8 in which a very similar sighting occured in S.Carolina on Dec.5. I found it strange that we witnessed what seem to be the exact same thing 2 days earlier.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
UFO streaks out of sky at a right angle at amazing speeds;2006-06-01 20:00:00;1-2 minutes;UFO streaks out of sky at a right angle at amazing speeds The UFO Report    It was about 8:00pm on a clear summer night, In Albany New York.  My friend and I were on our way back from the Cross-gates Mall.  As I came over the highway we were at the highest point of the road and started going downhill, the sky was completely visible.  We both noticed at the same moment a bright orb moving slowly across the sky.  He said it was probably a plane, but I was sure it was a UFO.  We both watched for a couple seconds as it moved across the sky.  Then out of nowhere the light shot downward, and then to the right, and streaked across the sky then disappeared. It appeared to make a right angle turn at very rapid speeds it was gone in a split second, and the streak lasted only about a second or two.  We were both stunned!  We knew that it had to be a UFO because no aircraft that the U.S.A. is capable to go that fast, let alone make a right angle turn in a split second.  There’s no doubt in my mind that what we saw that night was in fact a UFO and the answer to the question are we alone in this world is no.  Pretty soon everyone is going to know about it because it’s only a matter of time until we find out if their hostile or if their friendly.  What do you think their doing up there?  Studying us?  Looking for weakness?  Mapping our world for future plans?  The answer is out there and I want to find out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Green light ball on my picture.  ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flare?  Very small object, with lawn as background.  PD));2013-05-19 19:00:00;unspecified;Green light ball on my picture Sunday May 19th 2013 I was on my way back to University campus at Albany, NY. Approximately 800 feet from campus I took a random picture of the sky. Today, May 24th, 1am, I was going through my pictures on my iPhone when I looked to the same picture taken on the 19th. I noticed a tiny, but notable, green ball, it's a lightening green and perfectly round. Decided to post on Instagram, because until that moment I thought it was a funny thing. 30 minutes before I posted my picture a girl had posted the same thing: a picture of a her view/lanscape, and the same little green ball was there. she also noticed the ball in her picture while browsing her pictures on her phone. Both of us did not see the green ball at the moment when the picture was taken. Me at least because I didnt stop to take the picture and didn't look to the floor, where the ball is. I remember looking at the sky, that looked nice at the moment, and took the picture. Just want to know what is that if someone else got the same thing.  if its a bug on iPhones, what i dont believe thats the answer. ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flare?

Riding my bike at 11:11pm near my motel.;2016-05-27 23:11:00;2 minutes;Riding my bike at 11:11pm near my motel. I was riding my bike from Cumberland Farms and I took a left along a trail, following the light.  I knew it was different because there was a plane near the sighting.  I followed the light until it curved and hid behind the clouds.   As far as I am concerned, I witnessed several planes in the sky at the same time, but they were all blinking.  I was told that it must be the international space station, but I don't think so.   I have been looking for proof in the skies since I was an adolescence.  Now I have found it at 29 years old.  I even cried, asking, Why won't you take me away? as a joke.  I know what I saw.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
Star-like orange object that could move in a way I've never seen before - that emitted smaller objects and have them return.;2016-11-01 05:00:00;Unknown;Star-like orange object that could move in a way I've never seen before - that emitted smaller objects and have them return. At around 5am a bright orange object emitted a smaller object seeming to track the area.  I could tell it was not a star because it was moving.  It seemed to prefer a higher area in the sky--it would come down and then go back up.  It could change colors from orange to white.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
