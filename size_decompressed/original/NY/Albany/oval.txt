Many  takeoff’s and landings come over my house, so I have a habit of looking up to watch the planes. On the morning of  October  10, 2008  at approx 6 am, I went outside on my deck to have coffee and a cigarette. It  was still dark outside but to the east I could see the sky was beginning to brighten. There had been  times at night when I would be out with the dogs and  had seen satellites  move across the sky.  This  morning as I sat there I could see to the North a bright light moving south. At first I just thought it to be a plane getting ready to land with its lights on. As it came closer  it was moving at a good rate of speed and seemed to accelerate quiet fast. When it got overhead, it took off light a shot for a short distance and stopped dead . It then took off  north east for a short time and then went south again, again accelerating for another short time and again stopped and turned back  and then went south again. That’s w hen I lost it in the trees. In the beginning it appeared to be round in shape like a star, but when it was over head, it had more of  an oblong shape to it.  The size only looked like a bright star, so it was hard for me to tell how high it was in the sky. I had never seen anything this ever. It was truly an experience for me and I wanted to share this with someone.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
Oval metallic object;2010-10-11 04:50:00;2 min;Oval metallic object In passenger seat on I-87 south coming back from Saratoga Springs towards Half Moon I had a feeling to look up in the sky. I could see what I approximate as a few miles away an oval metallic craft in the air which stayed in roughly the same spot for close to a minute before descending directly down at fast speed and then seemingly vanished.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
Brightly reflecting oval shape drew my attention when I stepped outside around 3:30 pm this afternoon in Albany, New York;2011-12-26 03:31:00;3 seconds;I had stepped outside and noticed in the southern sky a shiny oval shaped reflection which I initially thought was a plane. The brightness of the object caught my eye and I originally watched as I thought this must be light reflecting off a plane however within 3 seconds the object had just disappeared. There was no contrail and the object appeared to be at an high altitude and in the distance so I heard no sound.  In summary, a brightly reflecting oval shape drew my attention when I stepped outside around 3:30 pm this afternoon in Albany, New York. The object was moving away from my vantage point and the object had vanished within 3 to 5 seconds of me noticing it and observing it directly as I originally thought it was a plane. I had fixed my gaze on the object as I believed it was so shiny due to the sun's reflection. The shiny decreased iinstantaneously into a blackish color as the object vanished into thin air.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
Bright oval disc shaped stationery object in the sky.;2015-03-19 19:30:00;5 mins approximately;Bright oval disc shaped stationery object in the sky Me and my wife were about to enter our local ShopRite supermarket, when we saw a very bright oval/disc shaped object in the sky.  At first I thought it was an airplane but it was quite large and wasn't moving so I pointed it out to my wife.  There were moving clouds below where the object was and we stood for a while to see whether the object moved or not.  The object remained stationery for about 5 mins, and we were able to take a picture of it with her smartphone. I should mention that I noticed 3 lights in a triangle around the same area the night before but unfortunately I do not have reliable witnesses of that event.  I was with 3 people who refused to even look at the sky when I brought it to their attention.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
