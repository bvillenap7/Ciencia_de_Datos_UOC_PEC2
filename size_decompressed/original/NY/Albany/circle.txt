I noticed two objects in a very clear night sky.  One object was clearly a jetliner traveling north to south. The other was the UFO heading the same direction but at such a high rate of speed that it just froze me in my tracks. The UFO then made a sudden dead stop in front of the jetliner.  Then it made what appeared to be 90 degree turn up away so fast that it just blinked off. I told my friends who were all inside the house. They kind of looked at me as most people would. Well, as we sat around the TV hours later, the 11 o’clock news started, to everyone’s shock the top news story was the report by the pilots of a UFO sighting. I sure would like to get a copy of that night’s newscast.  I will never, ever forget that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

My parents purchased a new easy chair for the living room. My Dad and I carried the old one out to the curb for the garbage man to collect. The chair was still comfortable. I sat down and spent some time gazing at the stars. I noticed a fuzzy ball of white light orbiting in a perfect circle, it appeared, right overhead. The light was dim and about the size of a dime held at arm's length. It circled overhead for a good minute. Then, suddenly, it shot off to the Northeast at a tremendous speed. Seconds later two jet aircraft looking like they were at full afterburner streaked right across the spot where the UFO had been orbiting seconds before. The jets disappeared over the horizon on a Northeast heading, apparently in pursuit of the UFO.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
Circle of light SUNY Albany.;2010-10-10 21:30:00;10 seconds;Circle of light SUNY Albany. A friend and I were taking a walk around SUNY Albany campus on a cloudy night and near the football stadium parking lot a circle of soft light appearing to be coming from above the clouds suddenly appeared.   The circle of light looked to have about a 100 feet diameter.  It pulsated once for a second and then faded out as if it were moving away (up) from the clouds.  There was no football game and no directional light source (like a flashlight or searchlight).   We both looked at each other and said, “Did you see that?!”   It seems I’m not alone in seeing UFO’s in Albany, NY. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

11 bright orange objects that were all flying in the same line over Albany, NY;2011-11-11 23:23:00;15 mins;11 bright orange objects that were all flying in the same line over Albany, NY My husband and I were walking our dogs when we saw what appeared to be 3 bright orange circular objects flying one after the other in a line.  We continued to watch when 4 more came, then 2 more than one and another one.  It's was very strange.  The we're flying just above the tree line and they all we're spread apart yet went in the same exact line and direction.  They were completely silent and made no noise.  Objects were very bright orange.  It was very strange considering it was 11-11-11 at 11:11 at night and we saw 11 of them.  Wondering if anyone else saw this..

There was a huge light they was shining in the sky.  As we approached and got closer to it, it appeared to be landing.  Then it got closer, but we could not here anything.  We drove under it and we couldn't see it anymore. But as we drove under it we tried to hear if it was a helicopter or a plane.  No plane could possibly move that slow and in circular motion.   The object flew away, and we were unable to locate it.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691

Distant (no ability to gauge, nor size,) a yellow light with alternating orange circle.;2017-10-19 22:00:00;1-2 minutes;Distant (no ability to gauge, nor size,) a yellow light with alternating orange circle. Redo:  Sorry this took so long, busy, fired, then I got the flu that laid me up for a month or more and I broke a rib coughing.  In that time my van’s battery ran down and I don’t have a computer on the internet.  I’m at the Albany Public Library. First about me: 1) I served in the US Navy and had watch standing as a duty on ships where I was trained to watch the sky and look for any in bound objects.  This entailed me having to give the location in the sky of anything in the sky, 2) I was in commercial flight school, second year, when 911 happened.  I am familiar with standard aviation markings at night. On 10/19/17 I was driving to work in Albany, NY, and made a shortcut through a nearby stadium parking lot.  It was night and I stopped to adjust my clothing which had bound up. As I looked toward the eastern sky at about 30 degrees off the horizon, due East I saw an object traveling at what I estimate to be about 100 plus knots straight up. The object was yellow with orange flashing lights.  This is not the markings of any terrestrial aircraft and the speed excludes anything like balloons, and the altitude it reached was at I estimate over a mile up. I checked with the airport and the ceiling was broken at one to ten miles, where it disappeared in one to two minutes. Then I saw a second object and recorded it on my phone.  The images move side to side from holding the phone.  The sound in the background by chance is a rebroadcast of Coast to Coast with Art Bell on my car's radio.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
Two illuminated objects travel in tandem silently one emits illuminated objects three different times.;2018-10-10 23:38:00;3-4 minutes;Two illuminated objects travel in tandem silently one emits illuminated objects three different times Viewing location:  University at Albany.  As I entered East University Drive from a parking lot, I noticed two lights on the horizon to the south of my position which I assumed to be an incoming flight to Albany International Airport.  However, this was west of the typical flight paths that I often observed, and it appeared to be dropping illuminated objects.  Suspecting this to be an aircraft in distress, I quickly drove into the football stadium parking lot for a better look.  By this time it was almost about to pass me, but then I observed that each illuminated object was separated and moving in tandem.  The second object continued to drop illuminated objects at intervals.  These were silent. Fortunately, I captured the objects (and another drop of illuminated objects) via iPhone 8 video as they were passing me and heading north.  The treeline can be seen with a bright monitor, as well as the corner of SEFCU Arena at the end of the video. Puzzled by what I had witnessed, I enlarged one of the objects with my video editing program — but it's just as mysterious.  The original file and the magnified file are in these Dropbox links.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/8t4pkv1ejxw3xc6/Video%20Oct%2010%2C%2011%2040%2042%20PM.mov?dl=0  https://www.dropbox.com/s/pmiyoxmve2kdvs6/UFO_Over_Guilderland_Closeup_Flashes.mov?dl=0  Based on incoming airline flights to Albany International Airport, I would estimate these to be 2,500 to 4,500 feet. A Times Union city desk editor called a spokesperson at the airport to inquire about craft in the area on this date and time. Two weeks later, the contact responded the airport had no information about these objects in its airspace.  Because the objects were to my right (heading north), I would estimate them to be traveling over part of Guilderland — which borders Albany.  One of the Times Union's reporters contacted a professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy for assistance, but he was too busy last spring. So, I'm filing the report here.  I have drawn maps that illustrate the path — which may be helpful, too.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
9 orangeish (or a single object) in the sky during the day.;2020-01-16 12:50:00;30 seconds;9 orangeish (or a single object) in the sky during the day. I was walking across the street in downtown Albany, NY and was looking at the building architectures. I saw a sign that I thought was interesting against the blue sky. That’s when I noticed an odd formation in the sky. It was a number of orangish dots, eight in a circle and one in the center (after looking at my photo). I couldn’t tell if it was a single object or nine objects together in unison.  There wasn’t a lot of clouds in the sky, a few. So the formation (or object) didn’t stand out like a plane in the sky, but you could definitely see it against the blue sky. The dots were a tad faint, almost like they were glowing, but very lightly. I don’t want to say they were pulsating, but they did come across as glowing.  It had some rotation. Again, not sure if it was a single object in the sky or nine individual objects, but they seemed to move in unison. The rotation was very slow, but it was enough to notice that there was movement.  I quickly pulled out my camera and managed to take a single photo. I tried to take a video, but as I switched over to video on my phone, the object(s) quickly moved to the upward towards the left and then was gone.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
