Sighting report:    Cigar shapped object over the Hudson River, Albany N.Y. 30 years or so ago;1972-06-25 15:00:00;10 seconds;Sighting report:    Cigar shapped object over the Hudson River, Albany N.Y. 30 years or so ago This report is being  filed decades after the purported event occured and it is additionally being filed by me as a third hand account.  As near as I can presently figure, some time in the early to mid 1970's, my Aunt was having a phone conversation with my father whom was at his home several miles away, when suddenly she stopped talking, gasped and then stated something to the effect of, Oh, my God I just saw a cigar shaped thing out my window.  After her initial shock and upon regaining her composure she attempted to further describe what she saw and what course of action the object she viewed had done.  To the best of my recollection and again the following is admittedly classified third-hand information, she advised my father that what she saw was rather long 2 - 300 feet in length.  She also stated that it travelled from the South to the North and from her perspective, likely directly over the Hudson River which is approximately one half a mile East of her home, in North Albany about 3/4 of a mile from Albany's boundry line with Menands, New York to the North.   Unfortunately every family member from that generation has passed and therefore I am unable to secure any more info.  I believe, dozens or more other people also saw the object, however as of this writing, I haven't attempted to confirm this information.   If  one reading this report recalls this event, please file a report. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD));42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
Albany NY 1975 varified sighting of multicolored flying object capable of high speed manuvers.;1975-06-10 02:00:00;5 min;Albany NY 1975 varified sighting of multicolored flying object capable of high speed manuvers. Driving on Northway returning from Mass. picking up chemicals for my company.  Wife sleeping when I noticed lights in the sky. I noticed many colors -not just red or green or white like a plane. With no other cars on the road I stopped the car and woke my wife up. There was a series of lights going from left to right on the object. It made a variety of zig zag moves and then it went up and out of sight at an incredible speed.  My wife saw exactly what I saw. The air was clear.-- Many years later on TV we saw another woman on a UFO show that described exactly what we saw. My wife and I are not crazy and we are highly educated professional couple.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691

He said that on the local news, a CBS station here in Jacksonville Fla, that he saw a news report about an unidentified object captured on film, video, by a news camera.  I have been looking to see if anyone else had any info on this sighting.  He said the news reporter said the object may have been an optical illusion, but when  still frame was looked at, it was seen to be a cigar shaped object with possibly fins or stabilizers on it.  The amazing thing was that it crossed the entire horizon in such an instant, no one was sure what they had seen! Has anyone else heard this news report?
