many Balls of light over donwtown Albany;2003-01-31 19:00:00;long time;many Balls of light over donwtown Albany 2 Witnesses looked out apartment window pointing south (in direction of state capital bulding, downtown plaza and over hudson river). Many fast moving balls of energy appeared with one coming once every 5-10 seconds. Unlike meteors they moved at angles upward toward the sky and some looked very close up (within 50 feet), while others looked very distant in the horizon. The objects moved fast, but left no trail and would dissipate or disolve quickly. Phenonemon continued for quite some time over a pretty dense area, so I'm sure others saw this. Objects varied from whitish to yellow and orangish tones. Objects made no sound and moved in straight lines. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
