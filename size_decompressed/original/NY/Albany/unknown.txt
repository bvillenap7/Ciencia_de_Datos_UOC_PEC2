object emmited bright light then sped off in a flash.;2003-10-12 02:00:00;30 seconds;object emmited bright light then sped off in a flash. I was leaving a party with my friend and we were going home through the woods, when i noticed that one of the trees was lit up, with a flashing blue/green light. I thought that one of my friends was playing a trick but when I came close to the tree i noticed that about 100 feet up was an akwardly shaped object. I called my friend over and when we saw it he could not believe it, the object was star shaped with extra corner sticking out in random spots. After about thirty seconds of viewing we saw a flash of bright white light, and the unknown object had disapeared from our view.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
3 orange moving lights in the sky, not aircraft.;2015-06-26 21:00:00;~5 minutes;3 orange moving lights in the sky, not aircraft. ((name and address of witness deleted)) Second Street ((deleted)) Albany, New York 12206  ((telephone number deleted))   	About me:  I am a former ((deleted--military)) trained and with other skills including observation.  I later reenlisted in the ((deleted)) and stood watches looking for anything approaching and around the ships I was on at sea this was in the water and air.  After the military, I trained as a civilian pilot, but stopped my flight school during 2001 on 9/11.  I watch the sky and know what I see. 	On 6/26 at approximately 2100 hours, I was southbound in Albany on route 787 on the ramp to interstate I- 90’s, the arterial.  About 30 degrees north of the horizon and due south I saw three orange pinpoint spots in the sky.  This was different from normal air traffic. There were no standard aviation lights which are green, white, and red.  The spots went from two and one behind at a third.  They were traveling at a high rate of speed and not on a normal flight path, usually in this part of the sky in the landing path to Albany Airport.  They were far in the distance. 	Their path was from east to west. 	I was into a turn and couldn’t keep my eyes on them due to traffic.  When I was out of traffic they were gone.  They were not stars there were two planets in the low sky to the west that might be Venus and Jupiter, maybe Mars and they were white in color.  I saw no stars. This was not glare or a reflection. These were moving and orange.  The first two were about five degrees apart and the third back at ten degrees from the second and a little lower in the sky maybe by one or two degree. 	I do not believe they were any form of meteor (falling stars) because there was no trail or streak and they weren’t bright enough.  They were traveling at the same rate of speed paralleled to the horizon. ((name of witness deleted));42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
