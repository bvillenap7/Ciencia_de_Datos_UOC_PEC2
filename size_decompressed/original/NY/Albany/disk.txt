Large disk shaped flying object with lights spotted in Albany NY before dawn;2013-10-22 06:00:00;30 seconds;Large disk shaped flying object with lights spotted in Albany, NY before dawn It was still very dark and cloudy, but I went out for a jog on my street which does have numerous street lights.   As I turned a corner I glanced up and saw what I thought was a plane at first, judging from the lights, but then realized this was a large saucer shaped craft not like any plane I've ever seen.  It was too dark to make out much but the shape and numerous lights, red, white and other colors I think, but the red and white were the most distinctive.   There was no noticeable sound emitted and the object moved slowly in a northeastern direction.   Before it should have been out of my line of vision (if it continued along the same path) it suddenly just disappeared from view.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
