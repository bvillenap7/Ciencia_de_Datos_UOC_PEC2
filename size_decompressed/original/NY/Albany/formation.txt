formations in the sky;2001-09-29 23:00:00;3 hours;formations in the sky there was a cluster of whiteish colored objects in the sky that i have never seen before. they stood in the same place for about an hour then when i checked on them again they were completely gone. i did see another cluster a little later in another part of the sky that i had never seen before. they were in the formations of a trapezoid with some surrounding......the other was in an T form. i dont see how these could have been starts and moved through the sky that quickly. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect celestial bodies may have been the cause of the sighting, but that is only an educated guess.  PD));42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
