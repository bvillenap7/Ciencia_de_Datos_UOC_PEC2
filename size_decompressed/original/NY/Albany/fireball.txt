Orange fireball;1978-06-21 03:00:00;20 seconds;At around 3am, I got out of bed to answer the call of nature. As I usually did, I looked out my bedroom window to check on the weather. As I was looking out I saw an orange fireball rise out of the back yard of the house across the street. It rose from behind a fence, hovered briefly and then shot off into the sky. The thing that made the biggest impression on me at the time was the palpable sense of evil I got from the orb. It was &quotbad&quot. So bad, in fact, that I ducked down so it wouldn't &quotsee&quot me. I haven't encountered anything like it before or since.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691

An incredible bright white orb sped past at an anormous rate heading east.;2002-07-24 00:30:00;5-10 seconds;An incredible bright white orb sped past at an anormous rate heading east. Lying down on my couch, I happened to look out my tiny window at exactly 12:30AM and saw an extremely bright white (ball, orb?) object. It flew by at an incredible speed and pretty low in the sky. My husband and I jumped in our car, and went into the direction it was headed, which was east in the northern sky. We drove across the Hudson River and drove another 10-15 miles. We saw nothing. I thought perhaps it came down seeing it was so low in the sky. My intial thought was it was a fire cracker of some sort.....then when that didn't make any sense I thought maybe a meteor. I contacted my local Albany news affliates to see whether anything was reported the next day. Nothing.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
An extremely bright white light zoomed past my window at 12:30AM July 24th.;2002-07-24 00:30:00;5-10 seconds;An extremely bright white light zoomed past my window at 12:30AM July 24th. While looking out my second floor window approx. 18 x18 a bright white sphere shot past my view. It was past my neighbors roof top, but by my estimation it was fairly low in the sky compared to planes. My husband and I jumped in our car and drove about 15 miles in the direction of where it was heading. This was in the northern sky heading east. We saw nothing while driving. I looked to see if any meteors were reported and even contacted my local news stations via email. Nothing was reported.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691

Glowing amber fireball hovering over Albany, NY, 7-1-2011;2011-07-01 23:45:00;20 minutes;Glowing amber fireball hovering over Albany, NY 7-1-2011 On July 1, 2011, 11:45 pm, I got a phone call from my boyfriend (((name deleted)) for me to go outside because There is something strange in the sky.    When I went outside, ((deleted--boyfriend)) was in his truck parked in the driveway, he pointed to the sky towards the east, when I looked in the direction he was pointing, about a ¼ mile away and a ½ mile up, I saw an amber glowing ball hovering.  It was slowly moving closer so I ran inside to get my camera.  When I returned outside with the camera it was hovering, about a minute later, it turned south and slowly faded away behind a cloud several miles away. ((deleted--boyfriend)) and I went back inside thinking it was gone.  ((boyfriend))  went on the computer to look for information.  After being inside for about three minutes, I went back outside, the object had returned to the exact location.  It was hovering again I screamed for ((boyfriend)) that it was back.  The object hovered for about two minutes and flew south.  As it flew away the glow became dimmer and the light from the moon enabled me to see the craft, it was a gray rounded shape. It faded away behind a cloud several miles away. ((boyfriend)) and I waited about 5 minutes to see if it would return.  When it didn’t, we went back inside the house.  After about 5 minutes in the house we decided to go back outside.  It was back in the same location again.  This time it seemed lower and much brighter.  It hovered longer this time for about three to five minutes, when we suddenly heard a helicopter approaching.   Off to the west about a ½ mile away we saw blinking lights of a helicopter hovering, at almost the same moment the amber glowing ball flew south quickly back into the cloud and the helicopter flew away in the opposite direction.  We waited about another 30 minutes outside and the object never returned.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
There were about 30 objects in a huge formation, round, reddish orange , globe figures.;2013-06-22 22:00:00;10 minutes;There were about 30 objects in a huge formation, round , reddish orange , globe figures.  A few moving in odd figure eight type movements.  This was on THE NORTHWAY coming from exit 6 to exit 5.  Cars were slowing down and a few pulled over.   Very odd no explanation, notified news 10, wrgb6, and air national guard.  I have no explanation for what we saw but the 30 or so globes in an equidistant formation slowly drifted towards the highway and these globes that looked like fireballs kepts moving without makign a sound.   I truly hope other corroborate what we witnessed.  Maybe a government flying exercise of some unknown technology?
