Albany 1995-1996 No sound, No light Shape outline brown;1995-06-06 21:00:00;all night;Albany 1995-1996 No sound, No light Shape outline brown I was wondering if you ever heard of the flying machines at Albany. SUNY Albany, down town campus and the organized field trips that transpired?  I can tell you the story but my friend Steve can tell you more about it. The machines were silent! I mean, if you ever seen a flying object which was silent? It always came in full view (100 feet across)  blinked in and it always blinked out and the object was in a loop. It kept coming over and over, all night long. I kept watching the see if I could see it coming, but always full view. Only lights on the tips. It was brown and seems that we could only see an outline. We (((deleted)) and I) watched it until day break and then we stopped seeing it. It was too over top for us. We could not understand it then and we still, do not understand. It just does not fit into any of the things we have learned. We were not doing anything. He was cleaning his window and that was all. We never went back to the football field next the down town campus to watch for it again, because we thought that it would never reappear after that night. But that is not the end of the story. A year went by or more and I was in LA now. I had a girl friend and we picked someone up at the airport coming from Albany. And he said that their was flying objects in Albany without sound and that field trips were organized nightly to see this thing in action. If you were in that car, this guy was of the wall with emotions. I could not talk with him and we both did not believe the other. It was too much then and it is too much now. I was wondering if you know the people in charge and if the trips and if you know if they were still going on or put me in contact with the organizers I would like to go. I am ready to see it again. My girl friends name is ((name deleted)) and she still lives in LA and she knows the people behind this, but we had a falling out and I lost her number. So they say. Also I did not contact you before because I thought silent flying objects were stealth fighters or the government had the technology. This all happen in 1995 or 1996 when I was at SUNY Albany New York. My name is ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691

I saw the object reported by FOX-23 from my place of employment;2002-10-21 12:30:00;8 seconds;I saw the object reported by FOX-23 from my place of employment A co-worker and I were outside the building we work taking lunch. We work on the State Campus which is located southeast of the Albany International Airport but within aircraft takeoff and landing patterns.  We were checking out the sky, discussing how unusual it looked with the different kinds of clouds.  Suddenly from the west we notice something bulleting across the sky.  It had a very narrow vapor trail which was so thin that I briefly thought if the puffy clouds were cotton balls it would pull them together like thread. It was also strange in the fact that the trail failed to scallop like the vapor trails of the jets we saw only moments before. The object made no noise. As it shot more to the northeast it was going to be blocked by the corner of my building.  I went down the steps just in time to catch a glimpse of the object.  It appeared to be football in shape only a bit longer and slightly deflated, with at least one fin on the top and bottom.  Its color looked dark metallic gray.  The air around it was a bit funny gave the appearance it was traveling in a fuzzy bubble. Since the military has been active in our area since 9/11, I thought maybe it was something new they were flying so I didn't report the sighting.  I missed the orginal FOX report but my co-worker told me about it the next day.  When I didn't see any followup a week later I wrote FOX email info line to make an inquiry and report that we had seen the object.  To date, I haven't heard anything from them. While I work in a civilian capacity now, my background is law enforcement.  I was a police/peace officer/investigator for 25 years prior to my current appointment. ((NUFORC Note:  The object photographed by the FOX 23 cameraman was visible for approximately 11 frames of video, or about one-third of a second.  We would be surprised if people witnessed the same object with the naked eye, although the object may have slowed at some point during its presence in the airspace over Albany, NY.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport: Thank you for your quick response.  While my report stays the same in every other detail, I failed to check a calender when submiting the date of our sighting and it wasn't the 20th.  My co-worker and I work Monday-Friday.  Ours took place during  the week, the day of the evening report of the Oct 20 object by FOX to the public.    I do know that for sure as my co-worker came in the next day all excited because he had heard the report of the original object on the news the night before.  He said that FOX had done a report on the object we saw (last time I listen to him).  I didn't see the broadcast and couldn't  find anything on it until I found your site yesterday (I was using the wrong search word on FOX).  I apologize for this inaccuracy. However, it does not change the facts that I have otherwise reported. You asked if the object made any maneuvers while we watched it.  No.  It was the vapor trail that first drew our attention to the object shooting like a bullet across the sky.  It wasn't until I ran down the steps and the object changed directions (from traveling due east to NE) that I was finally able to briefly get the shape.   Since we couldn't really see it before and I now could, I had the impression  that it tipped a little and  I was looking more towards the top of the object rather than the side.  It was just so fast I only got a glimpse.  The whole experience was almost surreal in that something that big should have made some sort of a sound but didn't.  Yet the vapor trail and its funny, fuzzy bubble around it told me it was really high up and something different. I have been thinking about its vapor trail and the way jet vapor trails look.  This object appeared to be more seering the atmosphere than putting out exhaust.. You ask if what I saw was like what the reporter filmed.  His object appears to look more like a walking stick.  Ours was a bit fatter and the fins a bit broader.  It looked as though the reporter's object devoured half of itself, just that much fatter. Ever since 9/11 when the hijacked plane turned right over us we have been sky watchers.  I have a window seat at work and  can tell when something is going on at the airport, note the flight pattern changes and every type of plane that takes off and lands, including the military.  ((Sentence deleted.)).  This was something I had never seen before. If I am following your instructions correctly on the degrees, it would be about 200 (coming from the W to NE).   I appreciate your taking the personal info out of my narrative, as I know my ((deleted)) and my supervisor would not appreciate the FBI coming to see me.  I work for ((deleted)) and we always have enough of things happening in the building without my causing a commotion over something like this.  My ((deleted)) would ((deleted)) me... Again, please forgive me for not doing a more thorough job in determing the accurate  date.  I am usually better than that.. Thanks.

Dim yellow lights on a solid object moving silently and quickly;2003-11-22 20:30:00;8 seconds;Dim yellow lights on a solid object moving silently and quickly My mother and I were standing outside when I looked up and saw an object moving from West to East.  It had dim yellow lights that were spaced out evenly in the front and were in the form of a triangle but without the sharp point (more of smooth edges). The back of it also had dim lights but fewer in numbers. One or two lights of same nature in the middle.  When I noticed it first it was a bit illuminated by the light  from the ground and I could see a shape of it.  It was a solid object (dark) except for the lights, and it almost looked like an egg, but it was so quick that I'm afraid I could be mistaken of the shape.  My mother saw it at the same time, but as I called my husband out of the house, the object disappeared behind the trees.  It was flying silenty, and rather fast.  It didn't look like a plane, because it appeared to have too many lights and it was too broad.  It couldn't have been a flock of birds because it didn't change shape and moved too fast.  It just didn't look like anything I've seen before.  I am very puzzled.  I would like to add that my mother had a sighting several weeks ago.  An object of a triangular shape with dim yellow lights on both sides, looked almost like a flock of geese, flew silently and quickly over our house.  She thought that it was birds, but first it's too late in the season, second, it was dark, so nothing could illuminate the birds like that, and third, the lights didn't change shape.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
Brilliant streak of white lite that ended in an extremly bright flash near Albany International Airport.;2010-07-20 00:35:00;A few seconds;Brilliant streak of white lite that ended in an extremly bright flash near Albany International Airport. I witnessed a very fast and incredibly bright streak of light that only lasted a few seconds and appeared to end in an extremely bright flash.   This happened behind a cloud but yet was very visible from my car as I was traveling north on I87.   It appeared to take place in the vicinity of the Albany International Airport.   It happened about 12:35 AM.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
Gun metal black crescent with 6 window-glowing lights.;2010-11-23 16:55:00;30-45 seconds;Gun metal black crescent with 6 window-glowing lights It was two days before Thanksgiving and I was returning home for the holidays.  My mother was driving and I was sitting behind the passenger seat which was empty.  My little brother was sitting behind the driver's seat.  We were on the interstate 90 in New York state and we driving home, which was 3 hours away driving east towards Albany, NY.  Although it was around the fall, it was still day light outside.  The sun was lower in the sky but not near the horizon yet. When sitting in my seat, I was looking out the rear passenger window.  Then I decided to turn around in my seat and look out the back window.  When I looked out the back window I saw what looked like to be a big fancy building.  At least that was my first perception.  But when I looked at the bottom of it, I noticed it was hovering right over this farm area on the I-90 in the air.  It was at the height of a tall building that you would see in New York City.  This object was about 3/4 of a football field away from me while I was in the car. It was a crescent-shaped object that was the width of about 20 airplanes.  When you see airplanes in the sky they look small.  Now imagine 20 airplanes flying wing tip to wing tip. It was that wide, so wide that I could look under it and count the other three lights that were on the other side of this craft.  It was gun metal black and six curved lights on it.  They lights almost looked like windows but there was a glow in the air surrounding these window-looking lights.  There was also a black rectangular shaped intricate engine-y object that connected to the middle of the inside of this black metal looking crescent.  The middle of this rectangle had a curved gate the bordered around the middle of it. I sat there and watched this from the back window and the back driver side window.  When I was watching this it just disappeared out of the blue.  It just blinked out the sky, it did not leave any trail, nothing. I did not see it appear, just seen it disappear.  It was too huge to just up and disappear like that. I remember talking to a math professor at my school about my sighting and he said that maybe it could have been a mirage but that mirages were not common in that weather condition during Autumn in November.  That day it was cold, no rain, just a little windy Autumn day.  The sky was a little gloomy, not sunny at all but not dark outside either. I know I saw an object, I was freaked out and at first I didn't want to believe what I had seen.  When it disappeared, I just turned around in my seat and sat there silent for 5 minutes in shock.  When I turned back around to check to see if I could see it again, it was gone.    When I got home, I took notes in my iPod about what I had seen and came to realization about it.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
