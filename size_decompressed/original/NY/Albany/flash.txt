Bright flash witnessed near Albany, New York;2001-10-01 22:30:00;2 seconds;Bright flash witnessed near Albany, New York While driving West on Interstate 90 W, between 7 and 10 miles outside of Albany, I witnessed an extremely bright, blueish white flash across the sky.  The flash was reminiscent of a comet image.  It moved in a direction from south to north (left to right) at an incredibly rapid rate.  The sky was cloudless, and the weather warm.  I was driving about 70 mph in the middle lane, with a tractor trailer truck driving 5+ car lengths ahead of me.  The flash surprised me, and I hit my brakes as did the truck in front of me.  I began searching the sky for any indication of the object, or flash, but found none.  I simply witnessed this flash of brilliant light.  It appeared to me to be too thick to be lightening.  It also moved more horizontally than anything else, but again was headed north and angled slightly towards the sky.  After the flash, I saw nothing else. Having seen both man made, weather and astonomical natural phenomena before, I can safely say that this did not appear to be like anything I have ever seen.  If I were to wager a guess, I would say that the streak was perhaps 100-500 feet off the ground, and perhaps 1 - 10 miles away.  It moved at a rate that no man-made object that I am aware of could possibly reach.  I am assuming that the reaction of the truck in front of me, hitting the brakes when I did, and slowing down, was due to the same occurance. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We wonder whether the witness may be describing the bright streak of light that occurred over the east coast on October 02, 2001.  We will invite him to try to establish the precise date of the event, using fuel receipts, credit card entries, etc..  PD));42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691

I was looking out my window facing the west in my dorm.  There were no airplanes in sight, and a break in the clouds.  I then saw in the sky a brief flash of white light, followed by it disappearing, with a streak following it as it accelerated north for about three seconds.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
