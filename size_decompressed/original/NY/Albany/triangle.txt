Airport radar confirms what I saw.    Please read my whole discription.;1974-06-15 13:00:00;2 minutes;Airport radar confirms what I saw.    Please read my whole discription. I was driving on a new divided highway heading east at 13:00 hours. There was a large field on my right. I was going about 50 mph and eventualy got up to about 85 mph. I had a glair on my windshield. I think it was a reflection from the craft. When I looked for the origin of the reflection I saw a triangular shaped object about 1/4 mile or less to my right. It was gray in color with out any markings or windows. The craft was going a little faster than I was going and I speeded up to try to keep up with it. The craft moved towards me slightly and banking like an airplane would. That is when I saw that it did not have a vertical tail like an airplane. I followed it for about one mile when it flew over  the crest of a hill which was covered with mature trees. They were about 60 feet tall. The craft was only about 100 feet above the ground. When I got on the other side of the trees it was gone. I turned around and retraced where I had seen it and made sure about my bearings. When I got to my sisters house I told her about it and of coarse she thought that I was crazy. This happened on a Saturday and the following Friday on the local tv news they said that the radar at the Albany County airport recorded an object heading south from Saratoga Springs at over 4,000 mph and made a right angle turn towawds the east. They said that it happened a week before which is when I saw what I saw. They also said that there were about 40 sightings of ufo's that same day. They also said that it was not reported on the news until the airport could verify that there radar was working properly. It has been so many years that it could have happened in 1974 or 1975 or 1976, but I think it was 1974. If you have any guestions to ask me my email is ((e-address deleted)) Thanks ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have inquired whether any newspaper articles appeared for this sighting.  We are surprised that FAA radar could register a velocity of 4,000 mph.  Such radars usually filter out objects with that high a velocity, based on the assumption that they probably are artifacts.

5 to 6 orange glowing lights upstate NY disappeared/ triangle.;2012-03-03 23:30:00;60 seconds;5 to 6 orange glowing lights upstate NY disappeared/ triangle. 2330 hours upstate ny leaving a friend's house looked up saw 5 to 6 yellow low level (maybe a mile and a half up)its hard to tell distance but much closer then the moon. I called to my friend and said look at that and he stated that they where just floating balloons with candles attached,it was at this point I began to think he might be right until all but three lights disappeared and the last 3 where in perfect triangle formation.I stated to my friend that the triangle looks weird and no sooner did i say it one of the lights passed between the other to lights at twice the speed the leading light then disappeared and the last to lights disappeared at or about the same location .when I say triangle formation my guess is that the lights where about 50 yards from each other,I have never seen anything like it before.

My friend and I were driving  back home to NYC on interstate 87  when I noticed what I thought was an airplane hovering in the sky. How;2013-12-30 19:00:00;1 minute;My friend and I were driving  back home to NYC on interstate 87 when I noticed what I thought was an airplane hovering in the sky.  However as I got closer it remained stationary. Being in the passenger seat I put my head out the window to a clear sky and could clearly see the triangular dark structure of it with its green white and red lights flashing.  I although music was playing low I could not hear a sound from the object.  Then when we got under the object it flew in the opposite direction to what I thought the front of it was.  I got  my friend to then pull  over and the object was no longer visible.  The  highway is very dark so the skies are clearly lit with stars and the weather is very cold but  sky is clear I clouds as well.  I expect other cars on highway might have seen it too.;42.6919153374249;-73.8105366483691
