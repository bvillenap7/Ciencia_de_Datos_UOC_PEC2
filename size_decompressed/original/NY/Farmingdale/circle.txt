All who were present were sober.  We then witnesseed approx 9 ufo's flying in groups of 3 in v like formations.  The aircraft was unlike anything we observed.  The crafts were not easy to observe and emitted bright light with what appeared to be a fiery shaft in the middle of the craft.  The craft appeared to be flying at  a moderate speed from east to west and  coming in and out of formation.  The craft initially came very close to us, unlike typical planes or copter flights in the area.  At one point we thought that the craft may land in and around the area we were in and the kids began to get scared.  The crafts then flew as far as we could see west until they were out of site.   There is a small airport airport near by but never have we observed such craft at night, and I am out smoking cigarettes at night all the time looking at the sky. I then preceded to call 911 to report the approx. 9 unusual craft in the towns airspace. When I informed the 911 operator that the craft wasn't a plane or helicopter she then became skeptical and questioned the veracity of my claims.The incident was recorded via cell phone video by 3-4 witnesses.;40.7305069767442;-73.4317069767443
