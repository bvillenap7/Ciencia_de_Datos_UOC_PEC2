Six orange fireballs in evening sky.;2013-11-09 18:00:00;10 minutes;Six orange fireballs in evening sky. At about 6pm I stepped out of my garage and saw a bright orange light coming east, almost directly overhead and it appeared to be a plane on fire.  It made no noise and was traveling at the same speed as a plane does when it's preparing to land at one of our area airports.   As it crossed over head and further east north east of me it stayed at the same altitude.    About two minutes later I saw two more orange fireballs seemingly flying together at the same speed and altitude about two inches apart when I spread my thumb and index finger apart.  These two headed in the same direction but at about the point I couldn't see them any longer they seemed to get very close to one another.   Approximately 2 minutes later a fourth one followed which was followed by a fifth and then a sixth went by again.  The fifth one sort of headed due north and then at a distance appeared to flame out.   A neighbor witnessed the last one with me commenting that she had heard about the GOCE s! atellite that was due to enter our atmosphere.  She mentioned that it wasn't scheduled to enter our atmosphere until Sunday the 10th or Monday the 11th.  I went on to the computer and read that there was another satellite ready to enter our atmosphere on 11/9/2013.  I'm not sure what these were because they didn't look like meteors that fall from the sky as you typically read about or see videos or pictures of.   I took four photos of the last one with my cell phone and one I was able to capture in zoom mode and it looks completely round and orange.;40.7305069767442;-73.4317069767443
