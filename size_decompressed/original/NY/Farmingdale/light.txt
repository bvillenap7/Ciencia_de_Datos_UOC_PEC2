Long Island bright hovering white light eye level on a clear night sky.;2002-10-06 03:00:00;30 min. plus;Long Island bright hovering white light eye level on a clear night sky. I was up late as usual and preparing to hit the sack I always look around outside from my window and appreciate how quiet it is and I look up and appreciate the sky and the brilliant stars on a clear night.  There was one star in the sky at about eye level, not high or low, that was so bright that I assumed it was a plane.  No.  No other lights on it, just one bright white glow.  I stared at it until my eyes watered and I would look away for a moment close my eyes and re-open them, look back and stare again...same thing.  It seemed to hover but then move quickly slightly to its left then right.  It was far away and the distance it seemed to travel so quickly ruled out my second idea that it might be a helicopter.  So with nothing better to do at three in the morning I went outside, leaned on my car in the driveway and stared, unobstructed by the window screen into a clear clear night at this bright object...still there and I noticed at times a sparkle of light to its left and right or maybe my eyes tired from staring, I don't know.  I gave up and dismissed it as whatever until I found that there have been many reports of objects in Long Island. ((NUFORC Note:  We feel that a twinkling star, or stars, would be the first possible explanation that would have to be ruled out in this case.  PD));40.7305069767442;-73.4317069767443
The beam of light was controlled, there was no sound.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 20:00:00;25 seconds;The beam of light was controlled, there was no sound. It was the last weekend of the summer Sept. 19th 2009 at 8:00 PM, the sky was crisp and clear, the stars were easy to see.  I was sitting in my truck and my girlfriend was standing right outside my truck talking to me.  That’s when a bright light appeared out of nowhere at about 1000 feet up to the left of my girlfriend,  I told her: “Turn around and look at that bright light up there.”  She was so happy to finally see something like this.  As we were looking at this bright light, a beam of light came from the bottom of this object, the beam of light was a controlled beam, something I have never seen before.  For example when you turn on a beam of light, it simply goes on and you can’t control it’s length.  It started off small then as the beam got longer it got wider, the beam of light never came down to the ground.  Inside the beam of light was slow moving white and green mist, the beam of light stayed in one spot and did not move at all.  There was no sound, then the beam of light started to get shorter until there was no beam left, then the light just started getting dimmer until it turned off.  It was not a helicopter because there were no aircraft lights or sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));40.7305069767442;-73.4317069767443
Lights in the sky that came in from the north going south then southeast the;2011-12-01 00:05:00;7 Minutes;Lights in the sky that came in from the north going south then southeast the The date was Jan. 1st 2012 Time was 12:05 AM right after the New Years Ball dropped The night was clear with a light breeze blowing east. Almost everyone was out on the front porch having a smoke when lights were spotted in the sky coming in from the north moving slowly south. There were a total of around 8 light in the sky. I ran in and got my video camera and you can see they stayed in a uniform flight pattern. And did not flicker as Chinese lanterns would.  The lights then started moving southeast, then the lights went slowley off. They always stayed in a locked flight pattern. You can see the video I shot at the following link:   www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybdZ-7MwewE;40.7305069767442;-73.4317069767443
Unexplained very bright light in the night sky.;2016-02-13 18:30:00;3 minutes;Unexplained very bright light in the night sky. Stationary very bright and fairly large light in the southwest sky (viewed while traveling south on Route 110 - the sky was clear with no cloud cover).  Lasted about 3 minutes. Very quickly shrunk down to a small light and then completely disappeared from the sky.  There were no blinking lights to indicate a plane or helicopter.   I will never forget what I observed (just FYI I'm an attorney and somewhat skeptical about these so-called sightings, but not anymore ...).;40.7305069767442;-73.4317069767443
