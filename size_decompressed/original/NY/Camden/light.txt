There were about 3 in oval shapes, kind of like the tailights on a car, but wider spread.  It was there for a minute and i told my boyfriend he needed to look at it.  He got up and looked at it but it had moved behind the path of the tree at that point.  He saw the lights though through the trees.  There was no noise, and it looked like an airplane, but closer like i said.;43.3381;-75.7537

I retrieved my binoculars and observed 4 different colors of lights along with a white light that seemed to be constant while the other colors blinked individually.  Blue, red, green yellow.  If I were to guess where this object was, I would say looking towards Amboy Center, NY.  The object moved back and forth or remained stationary.  When we first observed it, it seemed to be wobbling.  We also saw a very bright light over Oneida lake (from this location).  It seemed to be moving low and differently from a plane or I attempted to video tape it but it didnâ€™t who on the video.  We watched it for 10 minutes.  It remained there as I left to return to my home.  Note that dog was barking while we were observing.  Dog was looking toward wooded area;43.3381;-75.7537
