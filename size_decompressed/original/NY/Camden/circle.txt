Bright, motionless, Orange Circle decended very fast vertically towards the ground behind the tree line.;2001-12-21 20:30:00;3 Minutes;Bright, motionless, Orange Circle decended very fast vertically towards the ground behind the tree line. We were driving around 8:30 somewhere around 12/21/01. We looked to the left side of our car and saw above the tree line a large, bright, orange cirlced object. We looked at at for about 2 minutes, it was almost motionless the entire time so we disregarded it as a helicopter. We looked closer and saw no blinking lights or a search light. Suddenly the craft decended at a very rapid speed to the ground MUCH faster that a helicopter. It fell stright to the ground behind the trees. We got nervous so instead of going to find were it went down we went home. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.3381;-75.7537
