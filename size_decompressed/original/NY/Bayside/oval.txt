Glowing object hovering over Shea Stadium;2003-06-01 22:30:00;20 minutes;Glowing object hovering over Shea Stadium I was driving across the Throgs Neck Bridge with my wife and two sons.  My wife noted that there seemed to be a lot of planes in the air in the vicinity of Laguardia Aiport.  There was a Mets game on at Shea Stadium, and at first I noticed what appeared to be a group of small white lights moving in formation.  On my second look, these lights seemed to be helicopters and were actually stationary.  Then I noticed a large oblong object near the other lights.  This object had a red/orange glow emanting from the bottom.  The boject did not move across the sky, but it seemed to dip up and down periodically.  We continued driving over the bridge, and I noticed the object just above the tree line as I drove on the highway.  I pulled off the highway onto a side street and got out of the car.  I happened to have my digital camera in the car, and I took several pictures using the extreme telephoto setting.  Shortly after I got home, I got back in the car and headed to Shea Stadium.  I thought the object might be a blimp, and expected that if it was a blimp, it would still be visible in the sky.  When I got to Shea about 10 minutes later, there was nothing there.;40.7651307692308;-73.7701230769231
