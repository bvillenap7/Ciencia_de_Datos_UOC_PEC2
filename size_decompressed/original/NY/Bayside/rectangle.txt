Here I go again.;2008-11-19 18:30:00;20 seconds;Here I go again. I saw two objects tonight in two different locations in Queens at two different times. First object was definitely triangular shaped with three lights heading straight up, from where I do not know. Watched it for about a minute. Looks like the same thing I saw last year in Queens. Second object again in Queens was moving straight up and was a brilliant white which turned to red and disappeared right before my eyes. What is going on out there?;40.7651307692308;-73.7701230769231
