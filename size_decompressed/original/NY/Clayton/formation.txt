Two red lights traveling in formation for over 5 miles, no noise.;2005-07-25 22:10:00;5-7 Minutes;Two red lights traveling in formation for over 5 miles, no noise. We saw what appeared to be two red lights moving in tandem from the southwest to the east at 22:02 - 22:07 hours.  In binoculars, each light was defined as three red lights in a triangular pattern.  As they moved from west to east a white light became visible just behind the red ones.  The lights stayed the same distance apart for the whole time they were visible.  We watched them travel about 5 miles at an altitude just above the tree level.  There was absolutely no noise accompanying their movement - it was absolutely silent.  They continued easterly until they dropped below the tree line and could not bee seen any longer.;44.1407;-76.0634
