Two Red, Round, Erratically Pulsating Objects;2014-12-13 21:00:00;2-5 minutes;Two Red, Round, Erratically Pulsating Objects Our family was sitting down after dinner in our dining room when one of our guests stepped outside to take a phone call.  While he was on his cell phone, he noticed two red round and erratically pulsating objects off to the northwest.  One of the objects dipped down into the treeline near a local park called Green Mountain Lake (which is off the Appalachian Trail and located near a ridge that connects to West Mountain.)   The first object hovered visibly in the forest on the mountain-side for a few minutes.  Then, it quickly turned white and shot off at in at a diagonal, moving southwest at great speed.  The speed at which this object moved confirmed it was not a plane or helicopter.   Being close to the door, our guest yelled back to us, Do you guys want to see a UFO? With that, 3 other family members including myself went outside and where we also briefly witnessed the second red glowing object repeat the same pattern: dipping into the treeline, hoveri! ng, turning white and shooting off at great speed.  Our neighbor, who was walking his dog, also saw the incident and asked us, Did you see that?  In addition, as we live in a high traffic flight zone, there was one airplane flying at a higher alititude moving in westward direction possibly toward Stewart Airport at the time.;41.5755;-73.5951
