I am reporting this now because i just found out about the website.  This has been one of the scariest expiriences of my life.  Me and a couple of my friends were still up late at night in the summer looking at the sky cause shooting stars are really cool and its chill to hang out outside.  All of a sudden a HUGE fireball shot across the sky for about 5 seconds, it was very quick and it was so big I was in shock.  About 10 seconds after it shot across the sky there was a loud screech and we all freaked out and ran into the house.  I dont know if it was just something in the woods or what.  But whatever this fireball thing was it was gigantic and i have never seen anything like it ever in my life (I am 16.)
