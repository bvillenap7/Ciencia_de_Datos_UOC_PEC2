It had lights all over the underside.  People I told later said it was a laser show that had been talked about in a local paper.  It was a Tuesday night and they said they were shown every Tuesday night.  I have not to this day been able to ascertian whether any other witnesses exist but I continue to think about it.

This sighting may have been of the triangular-shaped craft that were seen by many witnesses in the Hudson Valley during this time.  PD));41.5755;-73.5951
