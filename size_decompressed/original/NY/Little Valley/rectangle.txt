Large, slender craft over Little Valley, New York;2007-08-23 23:00:00;2 minutes;Large, slender craft over Little Valley, New York I was standing outside at 11pm.  I heard a rumble in the sky.  When I looked up, I saw what looked like a long, skinny rectangle slowly moving overhead.  Little Valley, NY doesn't have airline traffic which is why I was curious when I heard the noise.  There were two white lights on the front and the back, and the white lights had a flickering red light.  It moved south towards Pennsylvania very slowly.  I followed it for several minutes until it disappeared into the night sky.  I'm familiar with how airliners looks a night.  There were no lights on the wings of this craft.  There was no visual evidence that there were wings.  There was no audible evidence of jet engines, just the low rumble.  I couldn't really judge how high the craft was in the sky, but it looked quite low for an aircraft.  Given how far away the front and back lights were from each other, the craft looked very long, but since there were no lights on the sides I couldn't really judge how wide it is.  If the distance between the lights on the back are any indication, it is VERY narrow.;42.2572;-78.8103
