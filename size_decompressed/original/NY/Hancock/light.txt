Orange starshaped light in the sky;2008-08-09 22:15:00;1 minute;Orange starshaped light in the sky I stepped out to walk my dog. I looked up toward the north west sky and saw a brilliant orange glow high above the tree line. It seemed to move to the right, then to the left. I ran back in the house to get my camera,and when I returned outdoors, it was starting to quickly continue north west untill I could not see it anymore. It was brilliant orange with a star shaped halo.;41.9912;-75.2624
