3 sucessive silent fireballs in sky sighted over Chautauqua Lake in western New York state on August 19th or 20th.;2012-08-19 22:00:00;4 minutes;3 sucessive silent fireballs in sky sighted over Chautauqua Lake in western New York state on August 19th or 20th. I am not certain if this happened on the August 19 or August 20.  My husband and I were walking home and standing by the lake, admiring the beautiful evening.  I noticed something in the sky that I thought might be a plane on fire.   It was orange and making no noise at all which concerned me.   While we were watching and discussing what it might be, another one came along and then a third.   I came into the house and immediately checked on line to see if there was any other news of sightings and found none.  My grandson found this UFO page today. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.2043;-79.4614
