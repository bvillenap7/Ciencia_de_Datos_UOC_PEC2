5 total red lights over long island.;2012-04-15 23:30:00;about 20 minutes;5 total red lights over long island. At first three balls of light that looked round slowly moved through the sky in a line formation. You could see almost 1 light on top 2 on bottom but the craft looked round in shape. They emitted no sound. They moved slowly however the lights started to fade and all 3 disappeared. About 10 minutes later 2 more of the same thing that we just saw came from the same direction and path the first three were moving. A plane was in front almost like they were being guided by it. The 2 disappeared in around the same spot the first 3 did. They disappeared in the same fashion as the first three. My father was the one who alerted me to what he saw. I came outside and saw the same thing as he did. Then my sister came out and we watched as they disappeared. Then minutes later we all saw the second pair come and disappeared as the first ones did.;40.7409;-73.4882
