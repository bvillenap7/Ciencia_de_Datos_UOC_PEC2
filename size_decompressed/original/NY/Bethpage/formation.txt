Smoking cigar on my terrace, noticed a large number initially (10+) of bright orange dots rising from the horizon to the south/southwest in small clusters, eventually fading from view. Additional clusters of these lights rose from the horizon every few minutes for the next half hour or so.  They seemed to be quite a distance away from my position.   Took 2 pictures with my Samsung phone, also 2 videos, video quality very noisy.;40.7409;-73.4882
