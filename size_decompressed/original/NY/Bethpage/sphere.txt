At first i thought it was a baloon in the air but it was not traveling up it was traveling across,then as i watched it for about 2 minutes there was another one over our head,this one was for sure strange as it was certianly a disk or spherical object that was silver or metallic and appeared to be spinning,it was traveling arround the same speed and when i saw this one i got out of the pool and stood on my picnic table to watch them and they simply vanished.. Please dont think im crazy we all saw the same thing and it was the strangest thing i ever saw.. please let me know if anyone else from the neighborhood reports anything similar. these things looked like nothing i have ever saw and they didnt make a sound,if i wasnt in the pool floating on my back i probably would not have seen them....;40.7409;-73.4882
