Cigar shaped UFO over Long Island NY December, 14 2008;2008-12-14 10:15:00;1 minute;Cigar shaped UFO over Long Island NY December, 14 2008   This aircraft was like nothing I have ever seen on my entire life.  It was cigar shaped with no wings attached and appeared to be silver in color. It was traveling across the sky at Mach speeds at about 15,000 to 20,000 feet.  The sky was crystal clear with few clouds and there was no sound coming from the aircraft.  It appeared to be propelled by something that did not leave and visible con-trail.  In my opinion, it was at least 300 to 400 feet in length and traveled in a very straight line. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
