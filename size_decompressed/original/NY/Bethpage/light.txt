bright light being followed by fighter jet repeatedly for approx 45 minutes;2001-12-30 03:00:00;0300-0345;bright light being followed by fighter jet repeatedly for approx 45 minutes At approximately 3a.m. sunday morning, I heard the sound of a fighter jet in the sky, I went to the window to look and saw a white/yellow bright star shaped object in the northern sky, moving west and behind it at a higher altitude, was one fighter jet. The object remained very bright for about 20 to 30 seconds, and then light dimmed to a small white object/ball while still moving ahead of the fighter jet going west.  This happened every 7 to 8 minutes for 45 minutes. Every time the sound of the fighter jet would approach, the objects light would appear in the same spot moving in the same direction, continuing to dim and move in a somewhat fast pace, always ahead of the fighter jet.  It seems they were going in circles from west to south to east and north. The night was extremely clear with a full moon. What do you think????;40.7409;-73.4882

As I walked outside to go to work I looked up to the South sky and saw a round white light traveling east.  The light was bright and round but wider in the center traveling in an S like pattern and then suddenly disappeared.   It appeared faster than a typical airplane and the sudden change of direction is inconsistent with a small meteor.   The day was a cold, clear with no rain, early morning still semi dark with a clear view of the sky.   Object would have been over the water on the south shore of Long Island.;40.7409;-73.4882
