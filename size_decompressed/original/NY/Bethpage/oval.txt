Silver disc flies across the sky;2004-11-06 11:30:00;12 seconds;Silver disc flies across the sky I pointed to the sky to show my friend the discoloration of orions left hand that night, and a metallic, ellipsed disc object swiftly cruised across the sky, no lights, sound, or slowing down. it looked very high up but moved 100's of times faster than any plane, and it shot up into the sky dissapearing. We clearly saw it, there is no other explaination. I was a somewhat believer.. but now i obtain the truth.;40.7409;-73.4882
five lights seen over bethpage ny;2011-06-18 23:00:00;5-6 min;five lights seen over bethpage ny 5 red lights together in the shape of an oval.  It came from the west, straight,over my  block.   We ran from the front of the house where we first saw it into the back yard where it went a little further.  It stopped, and just hung there for about 30 sec.  Then one by one the lights began to flicker and went out.  It was about the size of my thumb nail in the sky. Two of us are nurses.  There was a total of 5 people who saw this thing.  No one there had ever seen this before.;40.7409;-73.4882
