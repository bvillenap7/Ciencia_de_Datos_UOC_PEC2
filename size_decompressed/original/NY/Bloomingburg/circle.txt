PD));2017-01-13 19:35:00;~6 minutes;Flashing blue and red light moving around in a circle of tiny white lights, kept going higher and higher up. Walking my small dog.  Looked up at the sky out of boredom, saw a small patch of sky that looked a little lighter than the rest of the sky.  Studied it for a second, realized it was around a flashing, moving (side to side and in a circle) blue and red (?) light surrounded by tiny, tiny white lights.   Went inside, put away the dog, went back outside, it was still there but higher up.  Went back inside, came out again with the dog.  Dog wouldn't move from the porch so I left him there to look.  The UFO was barely visible.  It kept shrinking and shrinking.;41.5636;-74.4339

As I look East, I thought I was looking at a star flickering (as at times you do see them even in the early morning), but then it began to move.  It would seem as though the light would shut off and then come on again in a different position.  It then turned on and started moving all over the place so fast.  It kept descending over on the Pine Bush area.  Then it disappeared.  The lights were bright yellow and slight orange.  The craft looked circular in motion.;41.5636;-74.4339
