Bright blueish light flew over me I was frozen and couldn't move;1977-09-01 20:00:00;15 seconds;Bright blueish light flew over me I was frozen and couldn't move I was about 7 or 8 `1977 or 78.  This happened in upstate new york in keene valley.   I was sent across the street to ask the neighbor for a few screws.  On my way back i got to the edge of the street to cross it.  I was looking west and i saw a big white blue light.  It came over a mountain and crossed the valley.  I was looking at it and the first thing i wanted to do was go and get someone.  I tried to move but i was frozen in place.  I tried to yell but i couldn't talk.   The light crossed the valley about 500 hundred feet above me. I just stood there watched it fly over me.  It made no sounds at all.   It then went up and over a mountain on the other side of the valley.   After it was gone i took off running back to my house.  I didn't tell anyone about it for years.  It was very strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));44.2003;-73.7776
