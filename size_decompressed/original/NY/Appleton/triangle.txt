The most unexplained thing I have ever seen in my 36 years of existence.;2019-06-06 20:00:00;15 minutes;the most unexplained thing I have ever seen in my 36 years of existence. Walking through the field back home in Appleton, NY, from a day at the lake. Looking down there was red laser beams like an small formations.  I thought that from being in the sun for a long time, maybe my eyes were getting adjusted to the lighting outside as it was sundown.   My friend said, omg, do you see that and my other friend said she seen them too, so were walking wondering what in the world it could be as there was no buildings, towers or anything around we were literally walking back through a corn field, and I jokingly said it's like a ufo...the aliens are watching us.   Just then my girlfriend turned around and said omg it's a UFO... myself and other friend turned around and there was a triangle shape VERY bright light of some sort with a trail behind it, it was not a plane, jet, helicopter or like anything ANY of us have ever seen before, and it was around for about 20 minutes or so and vanished.;43.3108;-78.6316
