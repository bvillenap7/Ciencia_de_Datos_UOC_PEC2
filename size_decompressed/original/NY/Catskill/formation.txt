Moving about at a drift speed from south to north.  My truck stopped and off we heard no sound coming from them.  About 8 craft in a structured formation passed ahead of us about 45 degree angle.   Very strange to the point of hair standing up on your neck and head.  It may have been 35 years ago, but it could have been yesterday.
