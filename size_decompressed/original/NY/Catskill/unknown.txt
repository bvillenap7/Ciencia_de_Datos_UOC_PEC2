Strange behaving right and white light observed in sky over catskill.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of a celestial body.  PD));2012-03-14 02:35:00;3 hours;Strange behaving right and white light observed in sky over catskill I currently spend much time at my parent's summer house near a local liberal arts college I attend, and take time to stargaze outside every few hours.  Tonight I observed starting about three hours ago a light that varied between red and white doing what appeared to be moving erratically in the southwestern quarter of the sky.  At first sighting I was not sure of its movement and suspected based on its color that the object might be the planet mars, as I was unsure of its exact coordinates tonight.   At second sighting it had moved slightly more to the south and I figured it was definitely a planet, though I still observed both what seemed to be an up and down bobbing motion and a change between red and white lights that seemed to imply a rotational motion. My third sighting I observed the object for the longest period of time, since it had now gone far to the northwestern quarter of the sky and both the bobbing and the phasing of colors was far more apparent. I could only see the lights still and with little other info, I could  not ascertain the size or shape or distance of the object.  Eventually, after bobbing like what seemed to be lower and closer, it stayed white and became a more stable and less bright point of light. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of a celestial body.
