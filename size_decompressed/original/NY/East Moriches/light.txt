My brother and I were standing outside on our balcony.  I am a 19 year old female home for summer break while my brother is 24.  We have witnessed strange sighting of objects in the sky before especially over the last few weeks but have no decided to submit a report until now.  We witnessed an object which at first appeared to be a star very low in the sky, just above the treetops in the distance.  We watched the light/object for around 5 minutes. The object appeared to be flickering and flashing slightly.  We first noticed the object because we thought it was unusual to see a star that low in the sky and have had previous experiences seeing strange objects in the sky line while out on our balcony.  After watching the object for a few minutes, we felt a little uneasy and decided to go back inside.  I suggested to my brother that we use our telescope to look at the object with a better view.  My brother got the telescope and went back onto the balcony.  When he got back to the balcony, which was probably around 3 minutes later, the object was noticeably lower in the sky, closer to the treeline than it had been before.  He set up the telescope and tried to focus on the star-like object.  He got a decent unfocused glimpse of the object for around 10 seconds and noticed flashing lights and changing colors within the object.  He stated that the object almost seemed organic.  He watched the object slowly descend and straddle the treeline for a few seconds.  It then dipped below the treeline and stayed there for a few seconds, before popping back up for another few seconds.  It then slowly descended beneath the treeline and did not come back up.;40.8012;-72.7517
