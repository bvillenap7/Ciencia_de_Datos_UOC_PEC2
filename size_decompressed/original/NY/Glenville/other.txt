On September 4, 2020 I saw what looked like a star that was still visible in the morning sky.  I was taking my morning walk with my husband and decided to take a photo of the star.  It was very bright and almost twinkling.  As I pulled out my phone the light began to dim like it knew I was photographing it.  It began to move so I crossed the street and snapped a few more photos.  It quickly seemed to rise in elevation and then disappeared.  I have 3 photos from 6:26 AM to 6:29 AM, the 6:26 photo shows it as a star, but the next two I zoomed a little more and definitely notice that it was a drone, or some type of high tech machine.  I live directly across the street from Scotia Air Force Training Base, I see the solders all of the time, so one day I asked them if they used drones to surveil the base and I was told by the guard, no drones here.  I have seen these star like objects over my home area many many times.  I would love to know who or what is hanging out over my air space.  I will try to attach the photos.  Please use your technology to zoom in and you will see that it is not a star at all.  Thank you for taking the time to read and review this.;42.8800000000001;-73.9912999999998
