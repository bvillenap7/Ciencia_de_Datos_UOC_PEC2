While driving into schoharie ny at 600 a.m.on Jan.25, a fireball traveling north passed by my truck. The white and green flame was the size of a small car.  The fireball was about 100 yards to my left and 50 yards above the ground. Just as it passed me, the flame went out.  At that time I could barely see a rod-shaped object continue the descending flight path of the fireball.  I estimate the speed of this object to be 80-100 mph. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??
