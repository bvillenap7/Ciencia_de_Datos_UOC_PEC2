Approximately 200 feet above the ground, below cloud level.   My husband and I were sitting outside with our two boys.  My younger said  Mom, whats that?  And pointed to the sky.  When I looked and saw what he was pointing to, I saw a fireball, orange flames, very distinct.  There was some cloud cover, but not in the path of the fireball.  It dipped past the tree line and out of sight.  It was silent.;40.8108000000001;-73.3666999999999
