Gold object fell  from the sky.;2007-11-21 00:55:00;3 seconds;Gold object fell  from the sky Event Description: I was outside smoking a cigarette, facing west.  I was looking skyward, a little left of where my body was centered, and as I turned my head to the right I caught something gold falling out of the sky between the trees.   It was relatively small, probably a little bigger than the average star, and I imagine it was pretty far away. I only saw it for two or three seconds, as it dropped below the trees.  There was no noise - during or following what happened. I cannot say what it was, and that is the main reason I decided to write you, that and to see if anyone else saw it. Personal Background:  I am a college graduate with a business degree.  I work as a traffic management systems operator.  I am in my mid twenties, in relatively good health, although I have been treated for depression.  I am uncertain of how good my night vision is because I smoke and I have heard that smoking decreases night vision. I donâ€™t know what else to include in my report, but I will be happy to answer any questions.;40.8108000000001;-73.3666999999999
