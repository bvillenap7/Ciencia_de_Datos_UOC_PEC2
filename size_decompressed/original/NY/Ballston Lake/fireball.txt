Bright green fireball appears at the end of a burning meteor tail.;2010-03-04 23:45:00;1-2 seconds;Bright green fireball appears at the end of a burning meteor tail. I was driving home from work on the Adirondack Northway, heading north.  I noticed a very bright orange-colored tail (which looked like it belonged to a meteor) appear in the northwest sky.  It was very big, and looked like it was on fire.  The tail was pointed directly down and then a very big, bright green ball appeared at the end of the tail.  The ball appeared to be on fire as well.  The ball and the tail disappeared following a bright flash of light.   I was in the midst of approximately 20 cars, and I could tell they had seen it to because everyone braked at the same time.  Some people pulled over to the side of the road.  I listened afterwards for a sound, but there was none.  I could not tell if there was any sound while it was happening because my windows were up and the radio was on.  There was no explosion  or shaking afterwards, and I have yet to seen something of this nature since.;42.9192;-73.8552
