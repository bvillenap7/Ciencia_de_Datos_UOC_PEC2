Object hovering about 40-50 feet from the ground of a busy road during rush hour. Was visible to traffic going north and south on Route 50 in the Town of Ballston Lake, Saratoga County, State of New York. Initially the appearance was similar to a military craft coming down for a landing, but as you approached it you could see the craft was hovering and not propelling forward. The craft appeared to have a central nose like the tip of a B-17 but without propellers. A central large light at the tip surrounded by a ring of lights further down the cylinder. What appeared to be wings were rows of white lights on the sides of this cone....appeared something like this... 0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0( 0 )0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0 this being the center as I approached the craft, at a snails pace driving, I could see the shape of the craft was not an airplane but a disk....shaped like a teardrop or like the shell of a horseshoecrab. I drove directly under it and saw that the remainder of the craft was not lit. I drove up about 30 yards and turned around to take a second look, it was gone.;42.9192;-73.8552
