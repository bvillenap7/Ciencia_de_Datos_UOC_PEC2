I was walking my dog and looked up, a tic-tac white craft was floating southwest of my location, completely silent. It looked as if there might have been windows?  I grabbed my phone quick to record it as it was floating away from my location, however the sun was very bright at this time so I had a hard time seeing the screen, but DID record the location of the craft.  When I returned home there was absolutely NOTHING recorded but an empty sky and I am completely baffled.  I know what I saw and it was definitely there.;42.9192;-73.8552
