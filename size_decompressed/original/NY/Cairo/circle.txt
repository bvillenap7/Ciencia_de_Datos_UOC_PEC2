UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT;2004-08-18 23:00:00;5 MIN;UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT I WAS HEADING A FRIENDS HOUSE TO WORK ON ANTIQUE MOTORCYCLES. THIS WAS ABOUT 11PM. I NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT TO MY LEFT ABOUT 300' - 400'INTO THE AIR (CIRCLE SHAPED) THAT WAS MOVING FAIRLY FAST. I ACCELERATED MY CAR TO ABOUT 80 MPH TO TRY TO KEEP UP WITH IT. I WAS PARELLE WITH THE OBJECT FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES AT ABOUT 80MPH. I ALSO NOTICED THERE WAS 3 RED AND BLUE LIGHTS.IT HAD NO SOUND. IT HAD AN INTENSE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT UNDER THE CRAFT, AND ABOUT THAT TIME IT WAS JUST ABOVE ME TO THE LEFT AND I GOT FRIEGHTEND AND JAMMED ON THE BREAKS AND PULLED OFF THE ROAD INTO A DRIVEWAY AND AS SOON AS THE CAR STOPPED THEN THE OBJECT STOPPED IN MID-AIR AND BACK IN THE OTHER DIRECTION TOWARDS CAIRO, NY  WHERE IT CAME FROM. I TURNED AROUND FAST TO GET A LAST LOOK BUT THE OBJECT BASICALLY WAS GONE. GOT TO MY FRIENDS HOUSE AND TOLD 2 OF MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS INCIDENT, AND ONE OF THEM HAD EARLIER SEEN THE STRANGE LIGHTS TOO.;42.3105;-74.0143
