One UFO was slightly ahead of the other as they were flying in the exact same direction side by side. They went behind a large cloud and I was waiting for them to reappear on the other side as they were fly in a direct set path at same speed. I never saw them again.  I wonder if the shot straight up?  I can't explain it. The two black triangles were flying at a low altitude and were silent.  I live next to the 87 Northway.  I know it sounds weird.  I don't tell anyone about this as it doesn't make sense.  I am a nurse manager, paramedic and have 28 years in the Allied Heath Care Field. I don't care if you believe me or not.  It was a clear day with intermittent large puffy clouds. I will remember my sighting forever.  Now for the first time I share it with you.
