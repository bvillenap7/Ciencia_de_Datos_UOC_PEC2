All looked the same. Bright lights with red and blue smaller lights the first we seen was near the Selkirk glenmont exit mostly glenmont  the 2nd wone was near the Selkirk exit the third was near ravena we thought even maybe it was from the cement plant at first but once we got closer it was the same as the other two. We have traveled the thur way hundreds of t! imes at night never had we seen this or anything like it ever.
