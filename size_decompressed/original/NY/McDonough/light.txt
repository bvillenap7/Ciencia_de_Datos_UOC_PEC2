It was night so all we saw was a light but it was definitely unidentified. It seemed to be a few miles away and maybe a mile in the sky. It was a huge white light shining straight down. There were no blinking lights like you would see on a helicopter.  The light was completely steady and stayed on for at least a minute then just disappeared. No sound, nothing and it was gone. Witnessed by 4 collage educated, sober adults, 37-39 years of age and 4 kids under 8 years old. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));42.5105;-75.7719
