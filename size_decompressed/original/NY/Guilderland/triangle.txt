I saw a triangular object with lights on the bottom - the drawing that accompaied the above account was exactly what I saw - - it seemed to be hovering over the road.  I asked my son if he saw it - he hadn't - it was not in his field of view.  Traffic was moving along and I was going to pull over but thought it would be gone by the time I found an appropriate spot. I thought others must have seen it too.;42.701;-73.8969
Phoenix Lights in New York?;2006-07-19 23:20:00;1 minute;Phoenix Lights in New York? Tonight I was watching television and I saw a show on the Phoenix Lights. I was just flipping through channels but stopped dead when I saw an artist's rendering of what appeared to be a trianglar craft with several lights on it. I also saw footage of the Phoenix Lights. My friend and I were driving to his house some night in the middle of July when we saw a flying object much like the Phoenix lights. I made a comment on how strange it looked and how low it was flying. We slowed down and watched the lights until they were out of sight and then almost instantly forgot about them. Both of us don't actually believe in UFO's so it was easy to put out of our minds. But tonight when I saw that show it made me wonder. I am serious when I say that I was absolutely stunned to see on TV, what I saw that night about half a month ago. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
