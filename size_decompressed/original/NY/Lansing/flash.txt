Flash in the sky with colors, it wasn't the northern lights.;2015-03-11 05:13:00;5 seconds;Flash in the sky with colors, it wasn't the northern lights. I was driving to work 5:13 am, when I saw a huge flash of light that lite up the entire sky, at first it was a teal blue/green then it changed to pink then purple back to a teal then dissipated.   There was no sound.  It lasted for about 6 seconds.  You could clearly see the changing of colors.  There were no beams...the whole sky lit up.   I hope someone besides me witnessed this.   The flash came from the North end of Cayuga Lake.;42.5621;-76.5371
