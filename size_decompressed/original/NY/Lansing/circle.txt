We saw two sets of two orange glowing lights travel from the north to south direction of Lake Cayuga, these were followed by a gray round ship that had very small intense red light circling the bottom of the craft. The first set of two lights traveled together as a pair and traveled across Myers Park where we were watching the fireworks show and went out of site into a cloud.   At first we thought they were helicopters with search lights on, but as they went over our heads and they did not make any noise we thought differently.  The second pair of lights traveled in the same direction but this time they hovered over the park then vanished just below the big dipper. The fireworks ended and people were leaving the park.  We were discussing what we saw when a gray craft flew overhead and was very low to the ground (100 feet or so). It was difficult to discern its shape but the red light that circled the bottom of the craft clearly showed that the object was round.  It went over the trees and out of sight. None of the crafts made any noise.;42.5621;-76.5371
