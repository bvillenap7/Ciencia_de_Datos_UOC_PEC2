Moved deliberately and changed directions, like it wasnt sure which way to go Looked like fire, red and orange only.  Moved awkwardly from the west, would pause and change direction frequently.   Started to fade out slowly while heading north and then just turned into a black dot as it headed north out of my line of sight.  Never seen anything remotely like it before.   No sound.  Looked like a fireball.;41.0617;-74.0083
