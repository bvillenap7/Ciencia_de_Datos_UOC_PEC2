Changing white to red light that hovered and changed positions in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD));2014-03-14 23:40:00;120 minutes;Changing white to red light that hovered and changed positions in the sky. My wife was looking at stars out the window and called to me from the other room.  There was a object at a far distance blinking white to red to white to red that was stationary.  It intermittently was obscured by cloud cover but it kept becoming visible again, however, it would appear in another area of the sky.   At one point I checked what planes are above me on my IPhone and all it showed was one 737 in the sky at the particular time.    We observed it in the sky in various locations for over 2 hours before we went to bed.  It was too far away to take picture which I tried on 2 cameras.  At one point my wife observed another light flying to the ship she described it looked like a firefly.;41.0617;-74.0083
A white light descending sideways from the top of the sky to ground in 2 to 3 seconds.;2014-06-15 01:45:00;2 minutes;A white light descending sideways from the top of the sky to ground in 2 to 3 seconds. I brought my dog to the back yard to go to the bathroom at night and as soon as we got outside I saw a short red beam ascending, which I discarded  because I didn't see it clearly.  After watching the sky for a few minutes I then saw a white light travel from the top of the sky to the ground, descending in 2 to 3 seconds, while comming down sideways, faster than anything I've ever seen travel in the sky.   The light was bright and left no stream and had no tail.  I am skeptical about UFO sightings and stories, but I saw something strange tonight.;41.0617;-74.0083
