We saw an upside down v formation of 4 pairs of orange fire like spheres.  The sky was completely clear just after dusk.   They were stationary for the 2 minutes I saw them.   As I drove to get a better vantage point, I passed under tree cover and when I came out within line of sight they were completely gone.  I could see into space tonight its so clear.  But there was only a distant airplane.  Wow.;41.0617;-74.0083
