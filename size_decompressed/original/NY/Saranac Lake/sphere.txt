Multiple large, yellowish orbs appeared and disappeared in the sky;2011-12-08 17:10:00;30 seconds;Multiple large, yellowish orbs appeared and disappeared in the sky My son and I were in the car at Petrova School waiting for my daughter and I was looking out over the soccer field.  Suddenly, above a row of clouds, I saw a large yellowish orb appear.  As I watched, two more appeared next to the first, but the second two seemed to be connected.  Then the first one disappeared and a forth appeared to the right of the two that were connected.  After that, they all disappeared.  We got out of the car, and we saw the flashing lights which appeared to be military jets - they were moving very fast.  At first we saw two, and then a third.  They were flying back and forth across the sky (in all different directions).  As we watched, one of them appeared to have a red light shoot out from the side of it (I think this could have been another jet that had been flying close to the other, but I'm not sure.  Could it have been something else?);44.3240999999999;-74.1311999999998
