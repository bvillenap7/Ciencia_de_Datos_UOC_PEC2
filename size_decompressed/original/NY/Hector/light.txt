Bright ball of light slowly traveling west to east -size diminished then changed from red to pink then vanished.;2012-02-15 18:59:00;45 seconds;Bright ball of light slowly traveling west to east -size diminished then changed from red to pink then vanished. At  aprox. 6:59 pm Looking toward the North. I saw a small airplane flying with a bright ball of light, heading from West to East.  They were together briefly and then the plane traveled ahead while the ball of light continued to move across the sky more slowly (perhaps at a different altitude?).  My partner came outside just in time to see the ball of light traveling - and we both saw its light begin to diminish and change from bright white to reddish to pinkish then it disappeared.  There were several small planes traveling across the sky at the time they all looked and sounded very obviously like planes.  This ball of light was very bright, no lights flashing -  no wing definition - no sound.  It looked nothing like the airplanes that were in the sky during this event.;42.4979;-76.8838
