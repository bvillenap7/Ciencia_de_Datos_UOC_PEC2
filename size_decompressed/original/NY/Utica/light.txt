Two white lights, two blue-green lights (1/2 the size of the former), all looked like stars visible in the daytime.;2004-10-12 12:55:00;45 sec;Two white lights, two blue-green lights (1/2 the size of the former), all looked like stars visible in the daytime. Two white objects in the daytime sky, looked like stars visible in the daylight.  Two blue-green objects, looked like stars as well but 1/2 the size as the white ones.  All four appeared to be floating with random movement between the two white lights as all four headed toward the east together.  The blue-green lights were moving back and forth between the two white lights, which were side by side, but did not appear to be tethered together in anyway.  I observed an airliner fly near, but not over or under, these objects.;43.104372895277;-75.2334425051337
A swarm of lights moving and making different shapes.;2009-10-04 23:00:00;10 minutes;A swarm of lights moving and making different shapes. I was at home at the back porch when I noticed up in the sky some bright lights, I ran to the front of the house and there were all my neighbors looking and pointing at the lights. I called mi friend to tell her about it since she lives in Utica too, she came out and saw them too, she took her camera out and took a video of them. There were about 30 lights or more, all together forming a swarm of lights just moving around and making different shapes, they were brighter than the stars that were around them and some of them changed colors, from white to baby blue. Some of the lights kind of got bigger and smaller , they moved around other lights at high speed.;43.104372895277;-75.2334425051337
Fast  moving light seen from passenger jet over upstate NY;2010-06-25 23:35:00;about one minute;Fast  moving light seen from passenger jet over upstate NY Object seen during United Airlines flight 200 from Chicago to Albany, NY.  I was a passenger on the left side of the cabin, with a view to the north out my window.  Lights in the cabin were dimmed aside from a few reading lights and television screens for the inflight entertainment. It was probably sometime between 11:20 and 11:50 pm.  The weather was mostly clear, with the stars and moon easily visible and a very small amount of light left from sunset at the northwestern horizon.   Our flight was beginning to make its initial descent to the Albany airport, but still very high- as the cruising altitude of the flight was announced to be 39,000 feet.   As a former resident of Upstate NY, I could determine when we flew over Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse.   When we began approaching what I believe to be Utica, and possibly Rome to the North, I noticed a bright point of warm white light which at a quick glance would apprear to be a bright star or planet (no blinking ! to indicate it was a commercial aircraft,) to the north.  It was moving significantly faster than our aircraft to the ENE direction.   As it was to my eyes, simply a small, steady light, there was no way to determine how large or far away it was from our jet.  It is entirely possible that it was a high-altitude aircraft, or satellite, but it seemed to be moving much more quickly than satellites I've observed from a stationary position on the ground. I was only able to observe it for a minute or so, as it flew somewhat parrallel and higher than aircraft, then quickly away.  There was no change of speed during the sighting.  The light appeared to be flying in a straight line, although I may have seen it swerve slightly a couple of times- possibly due to air movement between myself and the object, or the movement of our aircraft.  No other passengers that I was near seemed to notice anything, and as I was traveling alone, I did not alert anyone around me to what I saw. I consider myself a skeptic, and I am making this report simply because it was something that I could not easily identify.  It did not look the same as other commercial or military aircraft I've seen from an airplane, and it was thousands of feet higher than necessary for a plane to use landing lights.;43.104372895277;-75.2334425051337

Light appearing and disappearing in different parts of the sky.;2014-10-27 07:35:00;5 minutes;Light appearing and disappearing in different parts of the sky. I was driving into work and noticed a bright yellow light appear in the sky that resembled a bright star. The light did not move in the sky.  After a few seconds, it faded away.  A few seconds later, it reappeared in a different location.  This happened a half dozen times before I was no longer in a location to see the event.

Unexplained orange lights.;2015-05-24 21:00:00;7 minutes;Unexplained orange lights. We were sitting in the back yard, when I looked up and seen a bright orange ball of light moving roughly south to north.  As the ball got into line of vision dead on it changed course and started moving east.   About 20 seconds later there was another one as bright as the first that changed direction at the same point.  Now with 2 in vision heading east another one came from south and followed, followed by a 4th ball that had the same behavior. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.
