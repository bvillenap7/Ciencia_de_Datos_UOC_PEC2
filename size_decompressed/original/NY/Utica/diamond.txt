Daytime UFO sighting 8/27/11 Utica, NY;2011-08-27 07:30:00;1 min;Daytime UFO sighting 8/27/11 Utica, NY I was driving on Rt 12 North coming out of Utica, NY at approx. 7:30am on 8/27/11 Saturday morning. I was looking straight ahead when it seemed that out of nowhere something appeared. The sun was very bright and it seemed to reflect off of some kind of object, which is why I noticed it. It was large and very bright....it looked metallic with a very odd rectangular shape with sharp points in different spots....almost like a diamond shape. It appeared to be rotating and hovering somehow..but did not look like it was flying. It was not a plane banking and did not look like any known aircraft that I could distinguish.  It was a very irregular shape. It did not appear to have any lights on it, but it seemed very bright due to what I thought was the reflection of the sun. Our windows were down and could not hear any type of sound or see any type of exhaust. My children were with me and they noticed it also. We watched it for about 30 seconds and as I was just getting ready to pull over to take a picture of it with my cell phone when it disappeared. It was literally that quick. There and then gone. I haven't heard of any other reports in my area lately. I should add that I live within close proximity to the out of operation Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome...that still has air traffic.  That and being within an hour of Syracuse...I see all kinds of planes all the time...and this was NOT a plane.;43.104372895277;-75.2334425051337
