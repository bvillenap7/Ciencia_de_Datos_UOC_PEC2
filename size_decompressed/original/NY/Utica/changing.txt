There were three of us at work on the overnight shift.  Went outside for a break, and were looking up at the stars and noticed one certain star at first, it was hovering and we noticed that there were flashing lights within it.  Red and really light blue lights were rotating around the craft.   It started to come closer towards us, then went around in a circular motion, and went back up to its original height.  We then noticed two others that were doing the same thing.  They didn't move like an airplane or helicopter, they just stayed and hovered in one small area.   They didn't come close enough to tell the exact shape.   We didn't hear any unusual noises.   We went back outside about an hour later and they were still there, just in different spots.;43.104372895277;-75.2334425051337
