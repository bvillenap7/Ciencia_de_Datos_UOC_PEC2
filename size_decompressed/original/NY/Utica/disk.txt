My private plane was followed by a ufo for over 50 miles.;1995-10-21 22:20:00;35 minutes;My private plane was followed by a ufo for over 50 miles. I was flying my plane (a tobago (tb-10) from Rochester NY to Utica NY.  I was at 5500 feet msl traveling at 115 kias.  The weather was clear and the wind less than 10 knots. About 10 miles west of Syracuse I noticed an object off my left wing.  It was keeping pace with me about 100 feet off the wing.  It was shaped like two convex plates one on top of the other wih the two plates being seperated by a row of bright but not dazzling cobalt bule lights.  The row of lights was about 2 feet tall. the ufo was about 7 to eight feet thick and about 35 feet in diameter.  The skin of the ufo was a metalic silver color.  It was a dull almost brushed steel finish.  At first I thought that is was from Griffiss air force base just north and slightly east of my path of travel. When I called Syracuse airport (the controling agency in that piece of sky) they were showing no traffic near me.  The Ufo then moved directly ahead of me and still kept pace with me.  There was no wake turbulance from the ufo.   I turned off all of my external and internal lights even my instrument panel and radio lights in case it was just some sort of wierd refelection.  The ufo kept position with me and orbited around my plane at a rate of one revoultion every five minutes.   I was handed of to Griffiss control after I was west of syracuse they were not showing any traffic near me either.    Shortly after I was handed over to the Oneida county (Utica NY ) control tower and started to decend the ufo pulled away to about 300 feet from my plane when I reached pattern altitude (1500 feet msl) the ufo departed to the north at an incredable speed.  To my knowledge I was the only witness to the ufo.  No other pilot that I have spoken to has seen anything like it.   I was not drinking and I never do drugs. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
