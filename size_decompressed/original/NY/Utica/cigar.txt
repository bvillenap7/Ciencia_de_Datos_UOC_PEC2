At one point i seen these 2 stars moving, at first i thought it was a cloud passing by, but looking more closely i noticed that they were moving and as i was stering i coold see that between the two lights it was like a cigar shape with the light from the other stars. I will not make a clame that it was on actual UFO but i dont know if it was,the whole thing lasted for at list 10 min untill the trees were in my way.;43.104372895277;-75.2334425051337
