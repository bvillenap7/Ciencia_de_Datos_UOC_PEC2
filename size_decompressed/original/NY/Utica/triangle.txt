Triad of lights, maybe satelittes in formation, moving across the sky.;2004-05-11 23:00:00;30-40 seconds;Triad of lights, maybe satelittes in formation, moving across the sky. May 11, '04 - 11:10 PM - I skywatch most clear nights and this was an unusually clear and dry night with no moon, so viewing was very good.  There were the usual satelitte sightings, a few meteors, and numerous airplanes.  Facing approximately due south, I noticed a satelitte about 45 degrees off the horizon, moving south-southeast. Another satellite traveling apparently in formation with the first appeared, and then a third appeared.  The three formed an elongated triangle and were very visible with the naked eye.  I did use my binoculars to track them however until they faded out one at a time, as most satelittes do.   At their brightest, they were about the same brightness as the stars of the Dipper - which is very visible overhead at this time of year. The shape of the triad did not change as they traversed the sky.   There were no blinking or strobing lights, and no sound. I am a private pilot and am familiar with aircraft.  The stars in between these points of light, we clearly visible in other words, it was not a solid object. It is possible these were NOSS satelittes but I have not yet found corroborating info.  I might add that this is the 2nd time I have seen this apparent triad of satelittes in the night sky.   The last sighting was in Washington State a few years ago, from Mt. Rainier - with 3 other witnesses.;43.104372895277;-75.2334425051337

Triangular object seen near Interstate 90, in Utica, NY;2007-10-16 19:30:00;10 seconds;Triangular object seen near Interstate 90, in Utica, NY I witnessed was a triangular craft flying silently right over my head in Utica, NY. it had lights on each point, and the outline of the craft was clearly visible. The object was moving briskly from west to east.. Seconds after spotting the object, I lost sight of it.. I assume due to light pollution from the city, but it seemed to disappear from sight in a haze. I have seen and reported UFOs before but this is my first glimpse at the triangular craft.;43.104372895277;-75.2334425051337
