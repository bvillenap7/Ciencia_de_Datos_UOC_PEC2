I was out looking for the near Earth asteroid when I saw three seperate objects in the night sky.  One was not moving and in the northern sky, a second was in the SSE sky and went from be still to moving erratically very fast and moving in a straight line.  The third object was in the SSW sky and was still and then started moving erratically very fast then moved off.   All three objects had lights that changed colors, The colors that I remember were blue, red, green and white. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars?  PD));43.104372895277;-75.2334425051337
