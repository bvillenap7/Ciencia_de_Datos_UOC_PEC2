I was looking into the sky and saw a round craft flying very fast in a straight line, It was very shiny and reflected the sun. I kept my eyes on the sky for some time after, and only saw a few planes. In relation, the airplanes I saw were flying alot higher than the craft. This object seemed to be flying quite low.;43.104372895277;-75.2334425051337

We observed three round globes over a portion of East Utica.;2012-06-30 22:02:00;2-4 minutes;We observed three round globes over a portion of East Utica. This occurred on June 30, 2012 at about 10:02 p.m.  There was almost a full moon with the sky cloudy but bright.  While traveling by car East on the Parkway in Utica, NY my wife and I observed  three orange round lights that looked like they were moving in a Northeasterly direction.  I pulled the car over on Pleasant Street and both of us got out to observe them more. The lights looked to be the size of soccer or smaller basketballs from where we were standing.  They were traveling in a straight line, one behind the other left to right.  There was absolutely no sound at all from them that we could hear. The first one separated from the other two and the light slowly dimmed from view.  The remaining two continued going in a Northeasterly direction. Then the first one (if it was the first one or perhaps another one) came back around (we did not witness it coming back around as we were in the process of getting out of the car it was just there again)and continued to follow the other two in the same direction.  We watched until the lights on all three slowly dimmed and then all three disappeared.  The duration of this was probably 2-4 minutes. We called the FAA Flight Service Station (my wife went on line to try to see who we should call when we got home to report what we saw) and spoke to a gentleman who assisted us. He was going to report this sighting to his superiors and gave us the wind velocity information we understood that you may want.  He also gave us the number to report our UFO sighting. We called at 11:40 p.m., no answer. The gentleman from FAA called back and left your web site for us to contact you. From the Doppler Radar Operation:  Wind velocity up to 10,000 feet – Direct observation of winds:  2,000 feet -	2.70  @ 10 knots   3,000 feet -	2.70  @  20 knots  4,000 feet -  2.80  @  20 knots  5,000 feet -  3.00  @  20 knots  6,000 feet -  3.10  @  25 knots  7,000 feet -  3.20  @  25 knots  8,000 feet  -  3.10  @  25 knots  9,000 feet  -  3.30  @  25 knots  10,000  no observation  About 9:52 p.m. 3.40  @  30 knots  On Monday, July 2 we called the Utica Police Department and asked if there were any reports of unidentified sightings in that area.  We spoke to an officer who said several complaints had come in about fireworks in that vicinity going off.  After listening to us he felt confident in claiming that what we saw were fireworks. Respectfully we have to disagree with him.  We know what we saw.  Having witnessed countless firework displays over the last 60 years, neither one of us have seen anything resembling what we witnessed (unless something new is out there that explodes silently into perfect round balls and continues to hold it’s shape, color and follows in a straight line until it dims out after 2-4 minutes).;43.104372895277;-75.2334425051337
Glowing red/ green ball bouncing around the sky in non human speeds and maneuvers for 15 min , truly incredible never will forget;2015-08-15 22:48:00;15 minutes;Glowing red/ green ball bouncing around the sky in non human speeds and maneuvers for 15 min , truly incredible never will forget The craft was circle in shape and bright red glowing ball when it was flying around for the first ten min it was red with a touch of neon green at the tip it was a perfect circle no beacon lights and no noise or sound what so ever at first I thought was helicopter because it was sitting still in the sky for sec to minutes before flying off in all directions it flew across the sky in seconds for the miles it flew but always retuned to were it started then when hovering straight back down it changed size to smaller and sold green the red color went away it also flew half way to our direction before zipping back to its original starting point after the 15 min it hid itself behind a 180 ft tree top and by then we were tired of waiting for it to fly off once again the craziest thing that this Ufo done was its turns it was flying so fast stopping at a dead hault then change its position and pattern erratically  I was in the military and was in an airborne chopper unit in the 101st airborne and no man made aircraft can maneuver the way this ball of light did.;43.104372895277;-75.2334425051337
