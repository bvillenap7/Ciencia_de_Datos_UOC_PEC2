Red sphere hovering low on our street;2019-08-12 23:00:00;3 minutes;Red sphere hovering low on our street Red Sphere hovering at about the height of the base of the roof on the house it waas nearest.  My husband and I were walking the dog and as we went over a small hill it was there hovering in the middle of the street,  It looked like it was only a few houses away from us. From where we stood it appeared about 2 ft wide maybe?  It was hard to tell.  It was a bright red, glowing sphere.  This street is well lit, so it was easy to tell that it was hovering all alone with nothing attached to it from any direction. It made no sound.  We got nervous and headed the other direction, looked over our shoulders, and it had disappeared completely.  The entire sighting lasted only a few minutes.;43.104372895277;-75.2334425051337
