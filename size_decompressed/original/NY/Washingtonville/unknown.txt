Walking my dog and upon return trip noticed 2 large white (the white color of White LED's) lights moving over Schunnemunk Moutain, had I looked up when I first went out it would've been over my head. There was NO noise, they were flashing together, no other lights were visible, the object moved at a steady pace. I held out my arm and it was 1 inch between my fingers in size. My daughter and I gave chase in the car but were unable to get close to object. the lights DID NOT illuminate the surrounding area as plane lights do, I'm on the flight path of Stewart Airport, we have NEVER seen such white lights alone on a flying object before. They were heading South -Southeast. There were other aircraft in the area, as it went over the mountain the was a plane above it but closer to me than the object itself.;41.4259;-74.1617000000001
