Triangle/boomerang shaped UFO near washingtonville area;2019-10-01 21:15:00;1 minute;Triangle/boomerang shaped UFO near washingtonville area Around 915 (p.m.) Iâ€™m staring out our second floor hallway and I see lights somewhere behind the woods behind my home and assume nothing until I see the lights descending up. I stared and noticed the lights were getting closer to my house.  This ufo resembled a triangle/chevron/boomerang with bright lights under it,  it was huge!!  There was no noise as the ufo hovered close over the wooded area and what looked like going around in a circle in the sky and then zoomed away and disappeared as my 7yr old son and I watched with a confused look on our faces.;41.4259;-74.1617000000001
