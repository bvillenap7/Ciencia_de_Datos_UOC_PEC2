green fireball-like object observed in the night sky;2008-02-28 19:30:00;30 seconds;green fireball-like object observed in the night sky February 28th Approximately 7:30 p.m. I was riding in the passengers seat of a car as my friend was driving me home on Toleman Rd at about 7:30 p.m. There was three people in the car, a friend of mine was driving, and another friend was in the back seat. Never before have a seen anything close to what I witnessed that night about a week ago. I was looking up at the sky when I noticed what looked like a shooting star. I was about to even say Hey, look at that shooting star in front of us!, but before I said anything I noticed it had dramatically slowed down but had not disappeared. The object came to a halt and began to turn green, it started to grow and looked like a green fireball in the sky. It was round, and bright. It sort of began to look like a green traffic signal, but up in the sky. Then very suddenly it disappeared. For a few more seconds I thought about what I had just seen in amazement. Then I proceeded to say Please tell me, I was not the only person who just saw that. My friend who had been driving immediately replied that he saw it too, and that he could not believe his eyes. The third person claimed to have not seen anything, but admitted he was not looking forward where the event took place, but to the side out the window.;41.4259;-74.1617000000001
