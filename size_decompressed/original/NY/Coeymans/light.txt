Rapidly descending bright light over river.  ((anonymous report));2011-10-09 19:00:00;1 second;Rapidly descending bright light over river While driving west on Interstate 90 and approximately 1 mile before crossing the Hudson River on the Castleton Bridge my wife and I saw a very bright light descend vertically  and rapidly nearby and to the south.  The descent speed was similar to that of a shooting star, but the light did not appear to originate in upper atmosphere.  Instead, the light first appeared at maybe 1000 feet above the treeline.  The light was bright white and descended very rapidly behind tree line, perhaps into the river.   The weather conditions last night were absolutely clear with a bright, nearly full moon.  Other aircraft were observed near Albany, but their lights were no where near as bright as this descending light.
