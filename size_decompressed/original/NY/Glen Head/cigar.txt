large bright cigar shaped craft with 5 smaller black crafts;1977-07-02 14:00:00;four minutes;large bright cigar shaped craft with 5 smaller black crafts My friend and I were sitting underneath a tree at the Glen Head Elementary school after a walk through town. It was broad daylight...the exact date and time I cannot recall..but I do know it was in July in 1977.. There above the tree line to our right (the school being also to our right) was a craft hoovering ..it was very bright like a white flash kind of light...and either from behind it or from inside of it came 5 other much smaller and black crafts..all in a row circling around the area....after all the smaller crafts circled around keeping inline the larger bright craft flew away with the other smaller crafts following it. There was no sound.  My friend and I looked at one another and did not speak...for nothing could be said to explain what we saw.  Sorry this took so long to report..as a teenager I just didn't know where or who would be interested. I would be curious if any other reports in the Glen Head area took place. Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));40.8199;-73.6183000000001
