White light over phoenix, ny made no sound;2009-11-13 17:00:00;2 1/2 minutes;White light over phoenix, ny made no sound I was smoking a cigarette in my backyard and was about to go back in the house when i noticed a light flying over my house(front(west) to back(south).  I yelled for my wife to get my camera but she did not hear me so i went and got it and was able to film about 20 seconds of it before it went behind the trees.  It did not make any noise and i did not see any wings or rotor blades.  It was possibly 1000 feet or more in the air.  I have looked at the video frame by frame and at frame 95, there seems to be 4 or 5 dark saucer shape objects that appear and then fly off.  It was flying to slow for a plane and it wasn't a star or planet.;43.2458;-76.3081
