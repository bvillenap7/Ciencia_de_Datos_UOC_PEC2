lights streak across the sky;2008-01-11 06:00:00;1 minute;lights streak across the sky On the drive into work this morning, I noticed three lights ( * * * ) in the sky.  I assumed it was an airplane that was heading straight towards us because it stayed in the same spot.  Then it suddenly started to move to the right ( the three lights were still visible) across the sky, then it stopped again.  The two outer lights turned off, the middle light stayed where it was for a few seconds the it shot straight up into the clouds, a few seconds after that the clouds lit up like an explosion.  No idea what is was but it was pretty cool to watch.;43.083;-77.9603
