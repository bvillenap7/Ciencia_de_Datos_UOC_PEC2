Red chevrons in the sky;2008-03-10 22:10:00;20 seconds;Red chevrons in the sky My husband and I were outside watching the sky (which we have tried to do every clear night since our first report a year ago) around 10:10PM. We saw two glowing red chevron shaped objects in the sky (we have seen it numerous times before and have named it the Phoenix, have been waiting to see it again to report it).   They were moving very fast. About ten seconds after that we saw a third one.  They were moving from south to north.;43.083;-77.9603
