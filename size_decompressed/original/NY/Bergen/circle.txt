Large groups of lights in the sky.;2007-03-13 23:20:00;2 1/2 hours;Large groups of lights in the sky. Last night on March 13 my husband and I (ages 33 and 31) were outside talking around 11:20 pm...the first objects we saw looked at first like three stars moving across the sky together, then they started weaving in and out of each other and then took off towards the North.   So we really started to watch the sky and about five minutes later a group of seven lights came over head doing the same weaving and flying,   Another ten minutes went by and we saw another group of three that did circles and stopped before taking off again.  The next group had about fifteen in it and it did circles in the sky and changed direction about three times all while weaving around each other then took off going North.  In all last night we saw 57 of the smaller lights including a group of twenty or more ( we couldn't count them all because there were so many in that group).  We also saw two larger red lights that resembled a tear drop shape but glowing red and much bigger than the 57 other lights we saw.......Needless to say we will be out there again tonight cameras ready hoping for a repeat performance! The smaller objects were round and white, The two larger objects were tear drop shaped and red ( we thought they almost resembled birds).;43.083;-77.9603
