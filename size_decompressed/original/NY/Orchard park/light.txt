Butterfly effect............lighted UFO;2006-09-02 01:00:00;15 minutes;Butterfly effect............lighted UFO There is a field behind my house that is farm land and the field that runs next to my house is around 500 feet long.  Well early this morning I was outside getting some fresh air and at the end of this field I saw a bright light that was tree top level.  At first I thought that it was a helicopter that was coming my way but it made no noise and it was moving around like a butterfly would. As I watched it I thought that someone had a kite with a flashlight hooked onto it or something because that is what it resembled but then I could also see a few blinking lights onto the side or back of it.  It was hard to actually see the craft itself because of the light facing my way. But I could see that there was a dark shape around the light like some wings sticking out.  I kept watching it and it kept fluttering around in a small area so I debated whether to run inside and get the binoculars or stay outside. Well I started to feel a little creepy being that I was well out in the open field so I came inside to get the binoculars and before I could get them up to my eyes this object took off quickly out of sight.  It moved to my right and up and was gone. It went from fluttering to a hard straight move without sound so I know that it was not a helicopter.  I also felt that it knew I was watching and at one point I had to look away because I felt that my eyes would burn from the light.  So that's all for now. Can't wait for the big to be over to get all of the updates and new entrys.  As always.... Believer  P.S. I also had an entry a short time ago about a cloud of gas or something that happened a day or two apart from a similar report in the paper in NYC.

update and correction;2006-10-06 02:00:00;30 minutes;update and correction Again I saw the same two crafts that I have seen in the last few weeks. They are always close together and the one that has the light that is more of a yellow gold color is always higher than the one that has the brighter lights. ************************************************************************************** Except for last night, or early this morning, the objects were to the East of my house. They were mostly staying in one spot but moved a little bit every once in awhile. I do not know how long they were there because I fell asleep. And again I heard no noise from these things. ************************************************************************************** I would like to make a correction on one of the last entries that I made, I saw this object on Oct. 1 and then I stated that I also saw it on Monday around 1 in the morning. Well I meant 1 A.M. on Tuesday morning. Sorry for any confusion. I am well prepared to stay up late tonight to see if I can catch this thing again. And I do have a camera this time in case I should see it. ************************************************************************************** That's all! blu :) ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.

Xmas colored rotating lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars??  PD));2010-10-10 01:00:00;a few hours;Xmas colored rotating lights I too have seen these xmas colored flashing rotating lights. It started out with two that would always be opposite each other and recently I have spotted up to five. They sometimes hover in one spot and other times they move around. I too have witnessed that when ,if they are low in the sky, they shut their colored lights off and only have a small whiteish amber light on when a plane comes near and then when the plane is gone the colored lights come back on. And they make no noise that I can hear. I also want to know what these are. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.7603;-78.7539999999999
