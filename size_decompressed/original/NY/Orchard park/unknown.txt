Spotted again as before........;2006-10-01 21:00:00;approx. 1 1/2 hours;Spotted again as before........ I too saw something: on Sunday night. I walked to my back door to look outside to see if this object was around again because I have seen this numerous times, and guess what? It was and it was in almost the same spot as it has been every time. **************************************** I was facing to the West and this object was about at a 45 degree angle. ( It is always to my Westerly direction), anyway it just hung there for a good solid 30 minutes with its colored lights flashing but on this night I noticed that to the North of my house there was also another star like object that had colored flashing lights too just like the other one. There was also lots of plane and jet activity in the area and these lights were NOT one of those. ******************************************* So this West light after hanging there slowing moved away toward the West North direction. As it moved away it still appeared the same. It had the same lights flashing. Either it was rotating or it was backing up. And as I have said before. This can NOT be a helicopter because it does not make any noise and it has been about a 1000 feet away from the house. Now the other light to the North of the house just dissapeared. You can hear a helicopter coming a mile away especially where I live. I live in a farm area with few houses around. So this is why I know that these lights are NOT helicopters. ********************************************* Then on Monday around 01:00 I saw this yellow light coming at an extremly fast pace from the West and it just stopped like on a dime at the same location at the end of the field as it has been doing. This time it was tree level and it briefly hung there and did that power up thing like it did before because the light goes brighter for a moment, maybe it was taking a scan or something, and then it took off to the North so fast that you would have thought that it was being chased by something. Then it was behind the trees so I couldn't see it anymore. *********************************************** Also on one of my previous sightings, I didn't mention that I also had seen a strange star constellation.........or so I thought. Now that I have thought it over,and I have tried to find that same star constellation, I think that it might have been something else. *********************************************** It sort of looked like a paddle of very large bright stars then it had a huge mass of other stars around it and there were small shooting stars that kept going through this mass of stars. It was HUGE. Maybe it was just that, a constellation but I just thought that I would mention it in case someone else has seen some strange star thing too. ****************************************** Well that is about it for now. The reason I am putting * between the pps. is because double enter doesn't work to separate them like it did before. It is massing the lines together so I thought that this would make it a little better to read. ******************************************* Later blu :) ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.  Witness sounds sincere, but we question whether all of her reports are related to sightings of genuine UFO's.  PD));42.7603;-78.7539999999999
Not sure if it was a fireball or a space object.

We were watching fireworks when all of sudden something firey came out from the south sky going east.  At first I thought it was part of the fireworks but then it continued to go across the sky.  I ran in the house to get my camera but I couldn't get a photo.  Went back in the house for binoculars but couldn't follow it, it was going pretty fast across the sky and then it disappeared.  No characteristics matched below.;42.7603;-78.7539999999999
