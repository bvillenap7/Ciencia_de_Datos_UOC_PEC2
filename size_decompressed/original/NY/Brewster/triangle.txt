Triangle Shaped-Matte finished flying object floating across the sky	;1997-09-23 22:30:00;30sec;Triangle Shaped-Matte finished flying object floating across the sky	 My girlfriend and I had been driving North on 684. We drove past he westchester airport when I saw a flying object. I figured it was just a plane,when I looked closer it had a flat (matte) black finish and was flat,triangular shaped with a bright light at each corner. I pointed it out to my girlfriend who also agreed that it was definately a UFO. I am the biggest skeptic in the world and never reported officially until now. I am no longer a skeptic about UFO's however.;41.4098;-73.59
