Traveling on a road with a friend of mine at between 5:15pm and 5:25pm in Brewster NY.   Waiting at a red light, we caught at a glimpse, a greenish blue fireball heading towards the earth.  It came rushing down into our view and disappeared quickly.   At first I thought it was a shooting star, but it was to big, bright and obviously in our atmosphere.  It was dark outside, but the sun had set within the hour. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.  We have assigned an arbitrary date.  PD));41.4098;-73.59
