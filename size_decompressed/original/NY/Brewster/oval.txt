THEN THE WHITE LIGHTS TURNED RED AND SHOT ALL OVER THE SKY SO FAST THAT YOU COULD BARELY FOCUS ON THEM AND STILL NO NOISE. THEN THEY WERE GONE. ONE RE-APPEARED, TURNED BACK TO WHITE, GREW IN SIZE THEN SHRUNK BACK DOWN AND DISAPPEARED AGAIN. NOT ONE SOUND WAS HEARD, AND WE WERE UPSTATE, NEW YORK IN A WOODED AREA NEAR A RESEVOIR. YEARS LATER IT WAS SHOWN ON HBO AND UNSOLVED MYSTERIES. THANK GOD, I THOUGHT WE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO SAW IT, BUT NOW WE FEEL CONFIDENT SINCE EVEN THE POLICE CLAIM TO HAVE SEEN IT. THERE IS A PICTURE OF IT IN A BOOK CALLED NIGHT SIEGE (THE HUDSON VALLEY SIGHTINGS) AND STORIES FROM PEOPLE TELLING THE SAME STORY I JUST TOLD. I WILL NEVER FORGET IT FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE AND WILL NEVER LAUGH AT ANYONE'S CLAIMED EXPERIENCES. THIS THING HAD TO BE THE SIZE OF 3 FOOTBALL FIELDS - MADE NO NOISE - FLOATED VERY SLOWLY - HOVERED SILENTLY FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR - SIX(6) WHITE LIGHTS IN OVAL TO CIRCULAR FORMATION - ONE LARGER RED LIGHT - ALL WHITE LIGHTS EVENTUALLY TURNED RED, SHOT ALL OVER THE SKY AND THEN DIAPPEARED (WITH NO NOISE).
