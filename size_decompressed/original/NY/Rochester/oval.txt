Ufo's seen hovering around the Rochester area;2002-09-07 22:00:00;1 hour;Ufo's seen hovering around the Rochester area I went outside because we had a power outage and I looked down the road to see if my neighbors power had gone out also.  It was a very clear night with many stars.  I noticed what I thought was a very bright star that seemed to change colors.  I went in the house and got my binoculars and told my husband and 20 yr old daughter to come out and look.  Without binoculars it looked like a brilliant star.  But with binoculars there was a definite oval shape with individual spot lights around the perimeter that pulsated and changed to different colors.  The object tilted and it appeared to have a cone-like bottom.  It hovered in the NW sky for about 30 minutes and then slowly moved North and West.  I notified the police but by the time the officer arrived, it was out of view.  I called my friend in Hamlin, NY (about 10 miles NW of Rochester) and she and her husband went outside and saw SEVERAL ufo's in the NW sky.  She spoke with the officer over the phone and reported her sighting. After the officer left, we noticed another ufo in the NE sky over Rochester that was hovering.  They appear as bright colored stars that pulsate and change color, but when looking thru binoculars we could definitely make out saucer shaped objects. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that  twinkling stars may, indeed, have been the cause of the sighting, but that is surmise.  However, if one or more of them moved as described by the witness, they could not have been stars.  PD));43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
My UFO Sighting from the 60s.;2015-05-15 22:00:00;12 seconds;My UFO Sighting from the 60s. I never reported this, but It happened in the 60's. My friends and I were camping out in my back yard. I looked up into the night, because there was a full moon out, and it was bright, I could also see the clouds, because the moon was so bright. Next: I saw something that looked like a tic-tac come out from behind the cloud and then retract back into the cloud. next the object came back out, but this time there were 2 of these objects, they both retracted back into the cloud and came back out and now there were 3 objects. The first craft (far left) rose to the top of the other 2 forming a triangle. Then shifted down to where the 3rd craft was on the far right. and the other at the other end (far left) rose to the top. then all 3 started rotating in this manner. They moved very fast, then like a rubber-band snapping I saw a flash that looked like a check mark and they were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  For some strange reason, witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
