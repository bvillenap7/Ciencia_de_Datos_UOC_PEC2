Flashing red light appeared a foot above my car then sped away at incredible speed.;1976-10-15 19:30:00;10 seconds;Flashing red light appeared a foot above my car then sped away at incredible speed. While I was in college in 1976,I volunteered at a community radio station as a broadcast engineer and was driving to my shift early one evening. It was dark and I had gone approximately 1/2 mile from my house when I saw a flashing red light. Thinking that a local police officer was pulling me over,I checked my mirrors and was surprised to see nothing behind me. The flashing was pulsing on and off at at rate of about 1 Hz,1/2 second on and 1/2 second off. When I looked around to see the light's point of origin,it was not visible. I saw that the hood of my white car was illuminated in this pulsing red light, and thought it unusual that the light source was directly above me as I was still driving down the road at 35 miles per hour. I needed to get a look at what ever was above me and pulled my head up in front of the steering wheel and looked up through the windshield. When I looked up,I saw a pulsing, translucent circular red light that measured approximately 10 inches in diameter and two inches thick. It seemed to attached to a large,flat surface that was so dark in color that it was barely discerable and did not reflect any of the light. It it difficult to tell how large the craft itself was. The light itself was very visible,and measureable since it was only a foot above the roof of my car! As soon as I looked at the light,it instantly accellerated down the road ahead of me at incredible speed and dissapeared over the tree line at the end of the road. I had experimented with lasers in my high school physics lab, and it was quite similar to flicking a laser pointer across the ceiling. The light flashed once and appeared as a streak over a distance of approximately 2 miles to the horizon, then dissapeared. There was no sound,or force felt as it departed from over the roof of my car. The sighting was reported over the air immediatlely upon my arrival at the radio station, but I received no phone calls or feedback other than my fellow engineer who encouraged me to broadcast my sighting. I have never documented my experience until now,but have told many of my freinds. 8/19/2003 ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD));43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
Large star like object moving slow and vanishing.;2002-07-10 19:24:00;1 - 11/2 min;Large star like object moving slow and vanishing. I just got finished bicycle riding.  I live at the top of what is claimed the highest hill in Monroe CO.  I keep a watch with me when I ride so I know what time it was.  We were having high pressure so there was not a cloud in the sky all day. As I came to the top of the hill I saw what looked like Venus in the day sky (1hr+ before sunset).  The sun was defininately the cause of the glow.  It was moving what would seem as commercial aircraft speed heading directly away from me (I'm facing due west).  I would have id'ed it as aircraft except for two problems.  First, the craft left no vapor trail.  Second, as the craft slowly became less reflectant by the sun as it moved away , I should have been able to see it better without the sun glarring off it.  Before it stopped reflecting sun light back at me it vanished.  If it was aircraft it would have been only on the other side of the city and I should have been able to see it.  I feel the craft must have been very large and outside of the atmospher.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
extraterrestrial walking around city;2003-08-09 03:30:00;1 minute;extraterrestrial walking around city In the early morning hours round 3:30 am my two friends and I were joy riding around the city of Rochester trying to kill time.  We were driving a mini van.  MY one friend was driving and my other friend was riding shotgun and I was siting in the first row of seating on the driver side.  driving down chili avenue, headed towards the city near Walmart, we were the only car on the road.  We saw a man with an injured leg attempting to cross the road about 200 yards from us.  As we approached the man he stopped in the middle of the road, we slowed our speed to a crawl and as we drove by him we looked directly at each others faces.  He had two black eyes about three times the size of a human, two holes for a nose and a very small mouth.  He was wearing a beanie so I don't know about hair.  We sped off in fear.  I don't believe what we saw was human.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
Transported to a beautiful world with benevolent beings.;2005-03-27 02:00:00;Unsure;Transported to a beautiful world with benevolent beings   My experiences are always an extremely vivid dream, and I have had multiple follow up dreams as well.  Every fiber of my being tells me that my experiences were real.  I am not a ufo enthusiast by any means, and have always believed abduction stories, for the most part, are the result of an overactive imagination or mental/physical disorders.  Here is my story:  The first time I had the experience, I never experienced the actual abduction or saw any kind of spacecraft.  All of the sudden, myself and maybe four other humans were in some kind of adminstration building with windows all around, with a huge table in the middle of this stainless steel like atrium.  We were all terrified, and scattered to find a hiding place  we had no idea how we got there, or who anyone else was.  We never saw the alien beings either!  Me and another human male hid in a closet.  There were no words spoken the entire time, not sure why.  All of the sudden, I wasn't afraid anymore, and ventured out into the atrium once again.  I walked to the big table in the center of the room, and some kind of a being or presence was showing me, telepathically, the secret to faster than light travel and their alphabet.  I was amazed, no longer afraid, just...awed!  Afterwards, I was lead, telepathically, outside of the atrium to their world.  It was beautiful beyond my ! imagination:  two suns one brilliant blue sun on the horizon and another red sun on the other horizon.  The world around me had a desert coloring to it, but there were strange plants in the distance.  I was telepathically told that my time was up.  It is at this time that I woke up in my own bed, feeling like I had been blessed by god.  I was able to draw some of their alphabet, but had no idea what it meant.  I was also able to recreate the diagram for faster than light travel.  This experience has stuck with me throughout the years.  The second time I had this experience, I suddenly found myself looking at the beautiful horizon with the two beautiful suns.  I wasn't afraid at all, but so humbled and excited that I was back!  Once again, I never saw the alien(s), but was able to understand, and realize that there were several beings near me, that meant no harm.  It is like someone was speaking over a radio directly into my brain.  Once again, I am unable to speak with my voice, but these beings must have been able to read my thoughts and emotions, because I got a tour of this facility.  As I am walking through the atrium, I notice the ceilings are over 30 feet high, the walls curved and there were no straight lines.  It was all a stainless steel looking structure.  Very interesting!  I walked past glass window, where I saw hundreds of human bodies suspended in some kind of clear solution with one tube going into their abdomen.  The tube had a florescent liquid flowing into each human's stomach.  I was hor! rified.  The being told me, telepathically, not to worry.  These were just generic shells that they had created through genetic replication many years ago.  The human shells that they had were devoid of any soul or spirit that made us human, and had no awareness whatsoever.  The alien then told me not to be afraid once again, they have no intentions of harming any human being, only a fascination and a need to experiment.  The only time they deal with real live humans is in a controlled and friendly environment with no intent to harm or frighten.  All of the sudden, in my mind's eye, I saw a small town just like any here on earth.  There were humans, happily living out their lives in a place that was created by these beings.  Almost like a scientific zoo, but the humans were blissfully unaware of their situation.  These were genetic reproductions of actual humans from earth that they created to learn everything about the human race.  Once again, the being reiterated that not a single human was harmed, and that these humans were farmed there strictly for research, and were able to live their lives to entirety without any intervention from these beings these brings were merely there to observe, not interfere.  Once again, I was suddenly outside of their facilities, gazing on the horizon, admiring their two beautiful suns.  I awoke, once again, in my own bed, with that same feeling of awe and being blessed with what I was able to experience.  I was astonished to have what seemed like a follow up visit, like these beings are making sure to take it slow, not to overwhelm, not to frighten, just to make contact with real earthly beings and share some of their culture.  I believe that the biggest thing these beings were trying to show me is that they are real, they have been making contact with humans for thousands of years, and were proud of their experiments.  Kind of like a hey, we are here, and there is no reason to fear us, let us show you!  I have not had another experience since the second one, which occurred in 2010.  Nothing even close.  I am not afraid that it will happen again, and I hope I do experience it again.  To me, it is almost like seeing the benevolent face of god.  These are truly good and beautiful beings that are reaching out.  It has been a life changing experience, for the better.  I hope that my story helps others and that others have been able to visit these beings.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285

Stationary obj. with multicolored strobes observed approximately 45 deg. above horizon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Arcturus?  PD));2013-09-23 21:30:00;30+;Stationary object with multicolored strobes observed approximately 45 degrees above horizon. Object seen 45 degrees above horizon, stationary with multicolored strobes - no sound. What peaked my interest was a red laser type light flashing on and off every 2 seconds or so... followed by green, white, and yellow lights. Object appeared to be brighter than most natural night light sources. I am a trained military observer having been associated with the US Navy and Air Force for several years. Last known location was in the vicinity of Rochester, NY.  Observation was from South town Plaza Parking lot. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) 30+ = Minutes. I know the difference between a star and an unidentified object... this was no star.   As for the other sightings man is way to arrogant to think we are alone in the entire universe.  God is way more inventive than to just create life on one solitary planet. ((END OF ADDENDUM));43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
4 white lights rotating in the sky,right within the clouds.;2014-03-14 22:00:00;5 minutes;4 white lights rotating in the sky,right within the clouds. Before I write this I want it understood that I was one to not pay attention to any so called UFO stories until last night, cause to be honest I had never seen anything like that before so I thought it was all BS.  Until last night,......... My bed room has a back door that leads outside onto a small roof around the back of the house, I use it when I'm going to have a smoke.   A little after lighting my cigarette I noticed what appeared to be 4 white lights rotating in the sky, right within the clouds, the moon was out and it was bright so I could see the clouds very well, the lights seem to be rotating simultaneously two at a time in a circles motion, curious I was like, What the hell am I looking at, trying to figure out if the lights were coming from the ground up or not, but from what I could see they were not they were coming from above the cloud.    Then just like that the lights rotated again into one but this time it was dead center and just ! diapered.  I stood there dumfounded not understanding what I just saw, but I do know what I saw.  Again I'm not a big fan or believer in the UFO thing, but I do now this, I know what I saw.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
Saw something shoot across the sky extremely fast.;2014-11-24 23:25:00;Seconds;Saw something shoot across the sky extremely fast I was driving home from work heading east down route 104 from route 259.  I caught a very fast object heading left to right.  The angle at which I saw it was about 20 degrees.  I am aware this is not much to go by but I have seen plenty of meteor showers and plenty of air shows and this seemed very strange how fast it was moving and the location in the sky.  I wanted to post this on hopes someone else had also seen the same thing.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285

Large strange light shapes in sky flying in loose formation in semi-circle, then off in a straight line.;2015-10-02 20:00:00;2 minutes;Large strange light shapes in sky flying in loose formation in semi-circle, then off in a straight line. I just saw 5 or 6 UFOS in the sky under cloud cover above Rochester, NY. I thought it was a spotlight advertisement at first glance, but then immediately saw the objects were large and far up--under cloud cover--but highly visible. They moved in loose formation and seemed to circle around a bit and then they kept going straight and disappeared.   It’s 8pm in Rochester, New York.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
