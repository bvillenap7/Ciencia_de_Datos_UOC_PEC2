Pair of lights, travelling East to West at extreme velocities;2001-02-18 21:05:00;10 seconds;Pair of lights, travelling East to West at extreme velocities 2 lights, side-by-side, perhaps with a dark object between them flew directly overhead at extreme speeds, basically going from horizon to horizon in about 10 seconds ( I only noticed it after it was about 45 degrees above the Eastern horizon). There were no sounds, but the object(s) had to either be extremely large or close to the earth, as they were much larger than the running lights of several airplanes that were overhead at different altitudes around the same time. I thought at first it could be the space station or shuttle, or, maybe a sattelite, but realized it was travelling East to West. The lights never blinked or changed intensity, And I think they actually jumped a bit to theNorth as they approached the Western horizon.

A double formation of 5 to 7, with a couple on outside of the 2 diamond shaped formations. Very high like star points of light, traveling north my vantagepoint put them traveling past the big Dipper. Only visible for about 5 seconds before lost in the horizon. To high for birds, to fast for jets.

Red Light with white yellow ora in sky near lake Ontario, Greece, Ny;2013-06-09 22:10:00;2 minutes;Red Light with white yellow ora in sky near lake Ontario, Greece Ny I was driving down Mt. Read Blvd. Rochester Ny to stone rd.  As I was driving I saw a red light in the sky surrounded by a white/yellowish ora, it seemed to be on the east side of me driving south.  And seemed ti be following  my driving path. I turned left at the light on stone rd.  And I still saw to the left of me.  I arrived at my friends house and as he was walking down the driveway to meet me I tol d him to look to the sky.  He reported the light was moving without stopping and stoped suddenly with no movement.  He stared for about 30 seconds and he said it faded outward towards space and dissapeared.  We both looked to the sky and nothing was there.  I am not joking and I feel like it followed.me and knew we were seeing it.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
2 sightings, 10 min apart, each time 2 orange/brownish dots moving south to north and incredible speed NO sound. Greece, NY;2014-08-16 00:10:00;5 seconds;2 sightings, 10min apart, each time 2 orange/brownish dots moving south to north and incredible speed NO sound.  Greece, NY 2 orange dots moving at incredible high speed south to north toward lake ontario.  NO sound whatsoever, absolutely quiet.  first sighting the right dot was moving in a straight line, the left dot was moving somewhat slightly curved but still in a fairly straight line parallel to the right dot.   Approximately 10 minutes later, 2nd sighting.  moving in same direction south to north.  this time both dots were much closer together, but again moving at incredible speed and again NO sound at all.  with less than 5 seconds they went from north Greece, NY, over lake ontario.   Shooting stars appear, get brighter and disappear.  those dots stayed same brightness, same size.  It's been quite amazing to see this since i have absolutely no explanation and always have been extremely skeptical toward any sightings i heard of or seen on shows on TV.   This tonight, though, really made me wonder what it could have been!  hopefully other will report it, too.   My wife also saw ! both sightings together with me.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
4 orange balls of light in the sky above Park Avenue.;2015-06-26 01:30:00;1 minute;4 orange balls of light in the sky above Park Avenue. Sitting in car, originally observed 3 orange balls of light in triangle formation, slowly traveling southwest towards Brighton area.   The lead light moved over trees and out of sight, then the two in the rear of the formation started to move towards each other until they were basically one ball of orange light.   It then proceeded to move alone back the way they came (northwest, towards Irondequoit) after a couple of seconds it stopped and a 4th ball of light moved into view from behind trees heading in the same southwest route the original 3 were taking.   The now 2 orange lights moved in what looked like a parallel formation, with one leading just a little in front.

Large craft, and separate red lights, in the early morning sky.;2017-01-05 06:35:00;5 minutes;Large craft, and separate red lights, in the early morning sky. Driving 490 West on the East side of the Genesee River, I first noticed a formation of white lights, as if the object had multiple lights, brighter white lights on the outside with smaller white lights outlining what looked to be a large craft.  I could not see the craft, only the white lights.  The lights were unmoving, unwavering and not blinking. Prior to this, while driving through Fairport, I had seen a moving object, which looked similar, however I dismissed it as an airplane, as it was flying in the direction of the airport. Shortly after seeing this larger object, I noticed several, I was driving so couldn't really stare at them, but there were a minimum of 10 bright red lights in the sky to the south of the highway, sporadically hanging in the sky.  They were intensely bright and some were moving around.  Visually they looked like a column of red lights there were simply not in a row, and they ranged from close to the rooftops to well into the sky.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
