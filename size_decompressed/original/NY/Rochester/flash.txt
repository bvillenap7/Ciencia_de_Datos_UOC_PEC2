I always wanted to discuss this with Dr.Schumacher but his untimly demise saddened us all. I have had three other sightings but I have no frame of reference in currently accepted reality to explain them as I can with the lunar impact. Immediatly prior to the moon entering its peach orange phase preceding the full lunar eclipse, I saw an explosion on the moon that briefly extended from the 11 o'clock postion outward into space to a distance of .20 lunar diameters. It dissipated quickly followed by an after shock less than a third the size of the first impact. Note I could only see the explosion from the edge of the moon outward into space. Only the black background of space allowed me to see this event which lasted an entire 4 seconds and fading to nothing in 6 seconds. While in Rochester I witnessed an inexplicable passage of two globes of soft nebulus lights six to eight inches in diameter. One followed two feet behind the first in the same trajectory. THEY WOULD NOT INTERACT WITH SOLID MATTER , PASSING THROUGH BRICK WALLS WITH ABSOLUTLY NO IMPEDENCE I tried to touch one of the globes. It had no discernable surface and with some trepidation I hesitated to penetrate its outer haze and it continued to pass through an inner wall about a foot below the ceiling. Since this event I do not recall a single week that I don't relive those brief moments. In fact my study of Hyperspace and 4th dimensional physics has been a great solace in understanding events we weren't taught in school. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was a superviser in a machine shop B shift,my guys had lunch at nine.;1995-05-17 21:05:00;10 minutes;I was a superviser in a machine shop B shift,my guys had lunch at nine. They were going out to get something to eat,and I was still working along,when they run back in to the shop calling me to come outside. I whent out thinking something happened outside. ((name deleted)) (thats my name) look up there!!I looked up and saw 2 bright lights moving from the east away from the shop slowly,then they moved so fast for a short distance,then hoovred above us for I think maybe 10 seconds,and then they accelerated so fast,they were gone in seconds. Im a much down to earth person,it was not a plane,or a helicopter or a jet,ive never seen anything moving that fast. This is the first time,beside my wife I ever talked about this event,and up to now I believe there is more there in this Universe that what we know. ((NUFORC Note:  In second identical report, witness suggests that the sighting may have been of shorter duration, perhaps closer to 3 minutes.  PD));43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
Rochester NY lights in the sky two sightings;2011-11-06 05:30:00;1 second;Rochester NY lights in the sky two sightings In the last week I have seen something twice.  The latest at about 05:30 this morning.  While outside having a cup of coffee and looking at the sky,  A light flashed on and a second later shut off.  It was not the red or green from an aircraft, but white light like a star.  Neither time did it appear again.  Had it been partly cloudy I would have figured cloud movement had done it, but both times the sky was clear.  The first time was east at about 45 degrees, and this morning was, North West, at maybe 60 degrees. The blink was probably as bright as Venus.  I'm not sure what other info is important.
