I realize that it has been many years since my sighting, but I wasn't comfortable coming out with this until now. Mainly because nobody beleived me who didn't witness this event.  I was working the B shift at The Eastman Kodak company at the time. As many of us were going to lunch, we walked to the ajacent building to the employee cafeteria. On our way over, we notice a guy looking up over towards downtown Rochester and pointing to an object in the sky. We were looking in a Easterly direction. There, about a mile or so away, about 2000 feet up was this sphere shaped object just hovering there. It wasn't possible to see any distinct color except for the changing color lights. It would change from green to red to amber. Sounds like a traffic light, but seriously, this thing was seen by scores of people. As others passed by, we pointed it out only to be teased and mocked. There were about 4 or 5 of us who stood there for at least 20 minutes and watched this out of pure facanation. The sky was clear and before sunset. All this object did was hover and didn't move at all. There were no other aircraft in the area. A short time later, the other employees were  returning from their lunch. Some looked at it and scoffed, Aw, thats just a balloon and some other cheeseie explanations and continued back to work. At that point, I myself had to return to work because lunch was over. Needless to say, I never got my lunch, I was too facanated with what we were witnessing. When I got home, I called the local planetarium to see if they saw anything. They saw nothing. I KNOW what I saw along with 4 or 5 other people. Not to mention the many other skeptics. I looked up as I was walking up to my building and it was simply vanished. The others saw this too. When I tried to tell others about it, they all just laughed and because of this I never spoke of it again.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285

It was a bright white sphere, moving very fast. The object was very bright, more so than an airplane, it did not have any red or green lights. The object was lit unlike a meteor, it was a steady white light, it did not leave any trails...It's size was approx. 1/2 of a standard pencil eraser, held at arms length, although the object was spherical. The speed of the object was increadible, it moved from 60 deg. above the horizon, to behind some trees at approx 15 deg. above the horizon in 3 seconds.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
Bright orange sphere, moved upwards, stopped for about 5-10 sec, then slowly, moved south, stopped & faded away.  3x within 60 minutes;2012-08-24 22:00:00;3 times, for ~30 seconds ;Bright orange sphere, moved upwards, stopped for about 5-10 sec, then slowly, moved south, stopped & faded away.  3x within 60 minutes Bright orange circle, or sphere, appeared to be slowly rising over the tree line in the western sky.  It moved directly upwards, stopped in one spot for about 5-10 seconds, then slowly,steadily moved south for approximately 10 seconds, stopped, and slowly faded away (took about 5 seconds to fade away - looked like it was getting smaller).  This occurred 3 times in the same location in the sky over a period of an hour.  Each time it looked similar and was in the same spot in the sky each time.  We had been using the &quotSky View Explore the Universe&quot app on the iPhone each time we aimed the phone toward the orange sphere it didn't show up on the app.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
No noise, unusual beginning.;2012-09-25 19:13:00;5 minutes;no noise, unusual beginning On Sept 25, 2012, I was taking image of Braddock Bay, Lake Ontario, near Rochester, NY, when I noticed what I thought were fireworks being shot near the lake.  They didn’t come from the ground, but raised up fanning out and arcing downward in 4 whitish lights which then faded.  This occurred straight in front of me, approx. 1 to 2 miles in front of my line of vision.    They started this pattern 90 deg South (to my left), and each time they repeated the same pattern until the fan of lights (4) were facing me and kept rotating as before moving from my left to my right.  There was an interval of between one or two seconds before each rotation.  It was at that point I decided to turn my camera in an attempt to capture this phenomenon. I was shooting 6 images of the same scene, shooting one f stop apart to later combine them later in a process known as stacking.  The images were shot in raw in which the camera shoots and records the data without any changes or modification.  I used a Canon 5d mark II  which produced images averaging 27 mp each.  I still have the raw images saved in which you can see the 4 yellowish discs in the horizon. As a result of this in the two images included I saw that the pattern had stopped and they were visibly flying in a North/Easterly direction to go over Lake Ontario towards Canada.  I have included a small version of the entire image and the magnified part of the image. Image 1  count from the right of the dock in the distnce to the third light to the left and you can see the small light in the sky.  Shot at 7:13  PM  (time of the 6th shot in the series)  Image 2  the light in the sky is more visible and you can compare the movement.  Shot at 7:15 ( again the 6th shot)  As for the light conditions the sun is setting and is behind and to the left of the 4 discs therefore the light is being generated is by them. Thank You, ((name deleted))   ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded to us.  Also, he has submitted a high-quality photograph, to accompany the report, which is posted to our homepage, as of July 22, 2016.  PD));43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285

Hovered in place for 10 min. saw headed north for a second  then disappeared. Saw one white glowing object sphere shaped.  I was at the bottom of newport rd in Irondequoit, New york parked facing north at the irondequoit bay.  To the west of me I noticed a glowing sphere about 500 feet above the tree lines.   I told the other 3 people in my car ans they noticed it as well.  They were all scared I got out of my car by myself and approached the object.  It straded descending lower and lower as I approached it.  It hovered at the same place barley moving for about 10 minutes.   All of a sudden, it headed upwards and north at great speed for about a second then vanished.   Went back to my car and it would not start battery charge was drained had to get my car jumped.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
White glowing sphere hovering for at least 3 hours around Rochester Airport around 3am;2020-05-01 03:00:00;At least 3 hours;White glowing sphere hovering for at least 3 hours around Rochester Airport around 3am Early Friday morning, May 1, 2020 I happened to glance out the window early morning only to notice a sphere-like object hovering in the sky.  At first I thought I was exaggerating but I could not stop watching it.  Immediately I felt the need to start recording this object.  My husband was laughing at me until he walked over and watched through the window with me.  He became intrigued pretty fast as it was truly interesting.  This object stayed there for at least the next 3 hours.  As I had to get ready and get to work, I couldn’t continue to watch and daylight was coming.  I tried my best to get the best images/ videos possible and in one part of the video- (about 1:35 into the video at the bottom towards the right) there seems to be some white object shooting up towards the light, extremely fast.  I only noticed it after watching the video for the 3rd time.  I don’t know if this object has any significance or not but it’s definitely noticeable once it catches your eye!;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
