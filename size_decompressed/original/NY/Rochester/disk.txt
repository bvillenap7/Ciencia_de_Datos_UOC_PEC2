Disk shape craft with spinning lights over Rochester;1972-06-15 21:40:00;10 minutes;Disk shape craft with spinning lights over Rochester This happened sometime in 1972, during warm weather, the sky was dark.   My mom picked me up at work at a department store in Greece, NY, which closed at 9:30.  Shortly after she turned onto Ridge Rd., I looked up and saw a disk-shaped craft hovering over us.  It was perfectly round, and had spinning lights around the perimeter.   I made my mother pull the car over and I got out.  Ridge Rd. is a very busy street, so I couldn't stay out of the car long.  My mother saw it, too, and brushed it off as being an advertising plane of some sort.  I never saw an advertising craft like that!  And in the dark sky!   I have always wondered if someone else remembered it.  I wonder if it's the same craft reported in Buffalo on 6/22/72. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Saucer with what looked like a king's crown on top seen in Rochester, NY, west side of I-95.;1995-06-01 22:30:00;5 minutes;Saucer with what looked like a kings crown on top seen in Rochester NY west side 95 My sons when they were very little about 3 and 5 years old went to bed around 10:30pm they came down shortly after going to bed looking terrified.  I asked them what was wrong they said they seen something above our neighbors house through their bedroom window on the 2nd floor.  I asked them what it looked like they described a saucer shaped object with what looked like a kings crown sitting on top.  They said it had like a thick tether or rope with what looked like a bunched up couch cushion at the end hanging below it over the neighbor's house. They said they were watching it and all of the sudden it flipped lights on them they said it was so bright it made their faces hot and it scared them so bad they couldn't move they froze.  They then said the parts of it that looked like a crown.  The edges lit red and then it took off. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

UFO followed me;1995-10-21 22:00:00;10 minutes;UFO followed me I was reading through the database and stumbled upon a report filed by a pilot about a sighting that happened on 21st November 1995.  I had a similar sighting around or on that date.  I cannot remember the exact time or date but the sighting is pretty much the same.   I was heading home from my girlfriends house in Hilton NY between 2200 and 2300.  I was driving along the parkway, east to Rochester.  I noticed off to my left (north) a blue light over Lake Ontario. The light was moving south and then it banked to the east when it got to the edge of the water. That’s when I noticed the blue windows.  The more I looked at it the more it freaked me out.  It was saucer shaped with 5 or 6 blue windows or lights in the middle of it.  It was shaped like two convex plates one on top of the other with the two plates being separated by a row of bright but not dazzling cobalt blue lights.  The row of lights was about 2 feet tall.  The UFO was about 7 to eight feet thick and about 35 feet in diameter.  (I am using the dimensions from the other sighting because they are the same).  The skin of the UFO was a metallic silver color.  It was a dull almost brushed steel finish.  It followed along side of me over the edge of the water for a few miles.   I started to get really scared so I decided to get off the parkway and take some back roads home to my dad’s house.  After I got off the parkway I couldn’t see the object anymore. I was coming around this corner when I saw the object hovering over some trees off to my right (south). Then I was really scared.  I started driving about 50 miles per hour in these residential areas. The object followed me for a couple more miles until I got to the power plant.  Then it just disappeared.  The whole thing really scared me and I am freaked out right now just writing this event down.   I am going to email a map of the area and try and make a picture. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
