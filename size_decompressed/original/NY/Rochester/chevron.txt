Like a puck on ice. It was hard to estimate size or speed because we did not know how high up it was. I could cover it with my hand at arms length. It had five lights on the bottom. Three on one side and two on the other. The lights glowed orange and shimmered like the street lights when they first go off. Never getting too bright or too dim. The rest of the craft was not illuminated and appeared black. It made no noise. The most curious thing about it was the way it seemed to 'slip' through the sky. It took about 120 seconds from the time I noticed it until is went out of sight. My girlfriend was shaken up a bit and asked me to take her home early. So the Et's or the Gov. or whom ever owes me for one ruined Saturday night.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
Huge low flying black chevron shaped craft sighted on the night of the lunar eclipse.;2004-10-27 22:30:00;1min.;Huge low flying black chevron shaped craft sighted on the night of the lunar eclipse. I was standing in my driveway looking up at the moon before /during/ after the lunar eclipse. It was a clear night and I had a clear view of the moon. While looking strait at the moon, a chevron or V shape craft flew right into my line of sight. It came from behind my house and passed directly overhead going towards the southeast. It was extremely large and appeared to be at a low altitude. I didn't hear any sound. It was black with dim round lights on the underside that were in triangle arrangement. The leading edges of the craft appeared to be a lighter shade than the rest of the body and I don't remember seeing the back side.  We have regular air traffic flying over the nieghborhood on approach to the airport so I am used to seeing low planes. You can hear the planes from the distance and they drown out all sounds when they are overhead so there is no way that this object could be confused with an airplane. I would say that the wing span was at least 3x that of a large jet. It was huge!.  A couple of days later I told some friends what I saw and one of them said that someone else they know saw the same thing.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
