Very large, silent fireball with no smoke trail.;1974-06-30 05:30:00;3 seconds;Very large, silent fireball with no smoke trail. Summer of 1974 or 75.  A very large, perfectly round, fireball with a long fire trail with no smoke or sound.  Headed east.  This completely lit up the sky.  I was at the top of a hill and able to see it disappear over the horizon.  It did not appear to be heading toward the ground.  It was so large it was shocking and will always be etched in my memory.

Walking dog, looked up, saw large orange fireball with a long orange tail streak across sky directly above.;1998-09-29 20:15:00;4 secs;Walking dog, looked up, saw large orange fireball with a long orange tail streak across sky directly above. Never saw anything like it before. Early evening, clear city sky, I looked up and saw a strange orange fireball streaking across the sky.  It was the size of about 1/6 to 1/5 the diameter of the moon.  It had an orange tail that was about 10 degrees long.  It was travelling from East to West and burned out about 4 seconds after I first saw it.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
orange ball of fire hovering over  Rochester NY area, chased away by another multi-colored UFO.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2007-11-18 03:30:00;1.5 hours;((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD)) orange ball of fire hovering over  Rochester NY area, chased away by another multi-colored UFO The sighting occurred at approximately 3:30 a.m. in Brockport NY (15 miles west of Rochester NY). I was coming home—pulling in the driveway-- (I live on a 40-acre farm) and immediately noticed a very bright orange-haze glow in the eastern sky—when I first noticed the object it was hovering (barely moving) and it was glowing. I noticed it immediately because of the size of the fireball/light and because it was much lower in the sky than any other celestial objects. I watched closely because it APPEARED to be moving, and sure enough, it was moving. The sky was very clear and the stars were very bright and beautiful on this morning. I am a college professor, and I was 100 percent sober. I was so taken back by the object that I woke my sleeping mother out of bed so she could also witness the object with me. I’m 37 years old and am always very cognizant of my surroundings, and I have NEVER in my life seen anything like this. I watched the object for approximately 1.5 hours (until about 5:00 a.m.). The object would hover for about 5 minutes at a time (sometimes more) and then it would disappear by ascending at a tremendous amount of speed. It would then reappear in a few minutes and repeat the same pattern. You could witness a zigzag hovering pattern—it changed directions very abruptly and almost zigzagged while hovering but we also witnessed (what appeared to be) either rotation of the air craft OR lights that were spinning (like a giant search light)—we could see the light going back and forth. The object we watched was orange in color and very bright—like a ball of light. Towards the very end of the sighting, we saw another object that was very different in shape with multi-colored lights (including red). The object was completely different in shape---not round but more like the shape and light configuration of a traffic light looks like. It did not look like an airplane because the rate of speed at which this 2nd object was traveling was incredible. It almost appeared as if the 2nd object ! was look ing for—or chasing the 1st object. Eventually, the orange glow ball object disappeared (as if it was being chased away). I was facing east toward Rochester and the 1st object disappeared into the south-eastern sky. The multi-colored object moved in from the north-eastern sky and disappeared in the north-eastern sky. When I first got home, I observed the object from outdoors. I did not hear any noises associated with this object. It was not a helicopter and it was DEFINITELY NOT an airplane. As the object appeared to be getting closer, I ran indoors because I was scared! For the remaining time, my mother and I observed the object through the east-facing windows of our house.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
Two bright orange balls of light that moved quickly around each other, then suspended, then slowly, one by one, disappeared from view;2009-03-15 00:30:00;4 min.;Two bright orange balls of light that moved quickly around each other, then suspended, then slowly, one by one, disappeared from view My friend and I were driving east on Monroe Avenue in the town of Brighton, in Rochester, NY, on March 15, 2009. We were going home from a friend’s house after watching a show together. The time was approximately 12:30 AM. Almost immediately, I saw two bright orange balls of light in the sky, diagonally north of where we were driving. I yelled for her to pull over. We quickly parked in a parking lot facing the objects, in front of the Towpath Hotel. We jumped out of the car, and at that time, a man in another car pulled into the hotel and parked. We did not get his name, but the three of us watched this phenomenon together. These two objects moved at a very fast rate, independently, in all different directions, around each other, then they suddenly stopped and seemed suspended, parallel to each other. They were large and appeared to be at about the height that a plane would fly when descending. My friend took a picture on her cell phone. After a couple of minutes, the ball on the right very slowly seemed to recede and disappear. After it was completely out of sight, the ball on the left slowly receded, on a parallel path to that of the first one, until it disappeared. The three of us talked about it briefly, with all of us agreeing that they could not have been lights or aircraft that we’ve seen before. My friend and I felt thrilled to have witnessed such an event, as we have never had this happen to us before. We both have our masters degrees I am a fifth grade teacher and my friend is a computer programmer. Last night, we bought the book, The Phoenix Lights, and agreed that what we saw looked exactly like the orbs on the cover. We are curious if there were other reports from our area or other locations on that day.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
We saw 20 to 30 fireballs floating or gliding higher and then slowly flickering out.;2010-08-28 22:30:00;10 minutes;We saw 20 to 30 fireballs floating or gliding higher and then slowly flickering out. My husband and my sister and I just came back from playing miniature golf and were driving along the road. My sister saw what she thought were red stars and asked what they were.  My husband and I both said they were just towers, as we were near the airport.  But then they started to move and get closer and we knew they were not towers. Every few seconds more would float up until there were about 20 to 30 in the sky. We pulled over into a nearby plaza to get a better look and try to get some pictures.  Several other people had pulled in to look at them too.  One guy yelled out his window to us what ARE those?   We answered that we had no idea. The objects were completely silent. They left no trails.  They looked like orangish-reddish fire, they flickered, but it was clear that it was not aircraft lights (like red/white of planes).  Also they didn't appear to flash uniformily like a light bulb would.  It looked more like the flickering of fire. After a while the lights started to flicker out.  But my husband then pointed to where one of them was and we saw that we could still see something moving against the sky, it was just completely darkened.   At that point there was a commercial jet in the sky and they were moving about twice the speed of the jet. But before, while they were lit up, they were moving much slower. All three of us are college educated, upper middle class.  My sister is 25. I am 29, and my husband is 34.

Fireball in Rochester ny;2011-06-04 21:30:00;Ten minutes;Fireball in Rochester ny We were driving on highway 390 north in Rochester, NY, near the vinage lane exit when we saw what looked like a triangular fireball in the sky to our left.  At first we thought it was an airplane that had caught on fire, but the object was not moving whatsoever.   We stopped the car and were trying o figure out what it was, maybe a weather balloon or hot air balloon but it was not moving. The fireball finally moved straight across the sky to the left but very slowly and then it stopped.  It then floated straight over to the right and stopped.  It would stop for about a minute or two before it'd move again.  The object literally looked like a triangular bonfire in the sky.   It came towards us then fell back.  It hovered for another few minutes before it finally slowly ascended up and at a much faster pace went at about a seventy degree angle back upon the sky where it eventually looked like a red or orange moving star and then disappeared.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285

We originally saw two red/orange lights in the sky.  We thought it was a meteor shower and took a video.   We ultimately ended up seeing five.  They all followed the same path.  One sped up in front of another.   They all seemed to die out as they progressed, which is why we thought it was some sort of meteor shower, that and the red/orange colors.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
Bright orange orbs hoovering and zipping through the atmosphere with ease.;2015-09-27 20:00:00;1 minute;Bright orange orbs hoovering and zipping through the atmosphere with ease. I was standing in my yard and as I looked to the sky I saw an bright orange orbs hoovering and suddenly began zipping around the sky with ease and precision, I ran back into my house frantically trying to explain the situation to my brother, who took his time getting outside, but sure enough the orb was still out there. By time I thought to turn on my camera phone, I was only able to capture about ten seconds of footage before the Orb shot out of the atmosphere.  As me and my brother starred at each other speechless, no more than ten seconds after the solo Orb took off, four of the exact same orbs slowly rose up from the tree line, in a semi V formation,  and seconds after slowly rising  all orbs simultaneously began again, effortlessly zipping through the night sky both side to side and up and down. As the multiple Orb feat was so astounding, when I attempted to capcapture more footage with my cellphone, I unfortunately forgot to press the record button,due to over excitement. Therefore, the initial single orb sighting is all I was able to capture.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285

We had looked up at the sky and seen this bright amber colored fire type light.  It had to be about 25-35 feet above tree level.  We really got us is that after the first had gone by a second one had past about 2 minutes later and then a third about 2 minutes after that.  All headed in the same direction to.  NOW I know it was not a Chinese lantern because of its speed and it's  pretty windy for a flame to stay lit!!  Can't stress this part enough.  On top of that there was absolutely no sound.  We don't know what it could of been, but got our attention enough for me to look up what it could of been and ask questions.  This is my first stop to post this. ANY suggestions?  It was only one color to that amber fire color, so this has me baffled!;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285

The object was to the left and in a flash it it was in front of us I tried using my phone to take a picture but before I was able it vanish out of sight. I called my wife to see if she saw it too but she didn't but her mother was in the car with her and she saw it.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
