I went to let the dog outside for the last time and I was looking at the stars. I noticed what I thought was an airplane moving very fast across the night sky, I followed it because it was moving so fast and there were no blinking lights on the bottom, when all of a sudden it stopped and moved in the opposite direction. It did not make a banked turn, it stopped and backed up. Then the object started to do circles in the sky, and sharp 10-15% turns. I watched for a while, then I got scared and went in the house.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
Round silent object zooms across horizon;2004-10-27 22:45:00;5-6 seconds;Round silent object zooms across horizon I was watching the lunar eclipse tonight and at about 10:45 I saw something I did not know what to make of. An object appearing to be about 1/2 the size of the visable moon and a pale yellow orange color (almost like the moon) ran accross the horizon south to north at a very high rate of speed and curved towards the west just as it passed out of my view. (Its movement was similar to how a fighter jet flys over a city during an air show, except there was no jet sound or boom.  The object was mostly round with possibly a flat rear section.  At first I thought it could be a shooting star, but the size was too big and I have never seen a shooting star change directions. I figure other people must have seen this as many people would be out observing the eclipse.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285

Driving down the New York State Thruway on a cold, brisk, winter's morning my co-worker riding with me on our way to work notices a round, bright blue, metallic object hovering.  Within five seconds of seeing this object the object quickly shot towards the sky and disappeared.  When we arrived to work another co-worker who normally rides with us to work, but was on her own on this day reported seeing the same object disappear into the sky.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285

We had friends over for a camp fire and my neighbor noticed a bright light moving way faster than any plane could move. This light....flying object was streaking across the sky not changing direction or speed, it was way to high to be a plane!! And it was to fast to be a satellite. My neighbor who pointed the object out to us, use to be an ex-pilot and know aircrafts and speeds. This was a UFO without a doubt!! And made us all believe.

Orange objects in sky;2009-09-05 20:47:00;5 Minutes;Orange objects in sky When I was pulling into my driveway I noted a bright orange/red shape of light in the SE direction of the sky moving in a NW direction which was moving slower than an aircraft on descent.  I got out of the vehicle and immediately got my family members out to watch this phenomenon with me.  When we got outside again, we looked over to the South and noted another one of these light orbs in the sky along with the previous.  They were now moving in a direction towards the west.  My guess of altitude would be below 1,000 feet.  The light was constant, non fluctuating, and almost looked like a source of light on the bottom of the object radiating upwards to the top.  There was no noise associated with it, and the movement was steady.  No trails were noted.  The first object moved to the west of the sky, and turned direction upwards, and slowly faded away, the second object then followed to the same area and disappeared slowly.  I then looked back at the origin poi! nt and noted a third light of the same exact description follow the same path and again disappear. We live in the approach path of the International airport, so I have been seeing and dealing with planes in the sky for all of my life, however this was not a plane and there were no identifier strobes seen.  This was not a flare either, as it had a more orange hue than a flare.  There were no sounds of fireworks in the area as well.  When I attempted to look through the binoculars, the objects were fuzzy and could not be focused on. I stayed outside for a duration of ten more minutes after this event, and nothing else was seen. The path of these objects must have been a mile to three miles in length.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
Flying Saucer surrounded by 8 planes;2010-01-21 18:05:00;40+ min;Flying Saucer surrounded by 8 planes   On Jan. 21, 2010, I was in the parking lot at my local community centre.  At about 6:05 p.m Iâ€™m looking up at the sky.  What I see in the sky is an extremely bright orb with 8+ airplanes surrounding it, and flying at it.  As each airplane approached this object, it faded into a haze.  Before I went swimming I experienced a terrible headache and fatigue.  That night I experienced missing time, and I was temporarily paralyzed in bed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Orange Balls Swiftly Gliding Through The Sky In Rochester, N.Y.;2011-07-04 22:45:00;20-30 minutes;Orange Balls Swiftly Gliding Through The Sky In Rochester, N.Y. Date is 07/04/2011,  time is between 10:45-11PM, and the exact place is in Irondequoit, NY.   I was with family and friends and we just got done watching the fireworks and decided to sit down outside in the backyard and chat.   I seen one orange object floating in the sky traveling quite fast coming from the West and traveling to the East.  I didn't think anything of it and thought that it was something to do with the fireworks or even possibly a plane.  A few minutes later, I seen 3 more orange balls traveling the same speed, they were lined up one after thee other, a bit of a distance apart and were also traveling to the East.   I was with 5 other people at this time and got there attention and to our amazement we seen a plane fly through the sky at the same exact time and then we knew for sure that this was no plane.  My brother said they could have been Chinese lanterns, but seeing how fast these orange balls were going, each following the same direction and path, and moving at various speeds...we counted the Chinese lantern idea out.  The objects were orange in color, round in shape, looked like balls of fire gliding through the sky.   After seeing about 3 more sets of the orange balls follow the same path within a few minutes in between each set, we decided one person would Google it and 2 other people got out telescopes.  My brother was assembling the telescope and the balls continued on and then as soon as he had the scope ready to go they all of a sudden stopped.  I would say that we seen around 10 of these fireballs in total.  If anyone has any ideas what they could be or similar stories please get back to me.

They would rise slowly in random formation, moving delicately and dimly flickering.  It seemed to reach altitude of 15-20,000 ft.  Hard to judge.  Comparatively larger than the surrounding stars. They would rise and disappear only to be followed by more. Several people informed me they saw the same objects behaving differently.

Amber/orange balls 1 following the other changeing direction at unbeliveabley fast speeds;2011-09-09 20:30:00;1min;amber/orange balls 1 following the other changeing direction at unbeliveabley fast speeds We were looking out over the lake and saw a glowing amber/orange ball not like a flare but a distinct round ball.  It come from the west and abruptly shot north at a great speed.  A few seconds later it was followed by a second ball traveling at the same speed and flight pattern as the first.  The sky was clear and the sun had not yet set.  The time was approximate. We decided to report this now because we have seen the exact objects on several different TV programs.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
Bright, flashing green object moving quickly across the sky;2012-07-04 22:10:00;5 minutes;Bright, flashing green object moving quickly across the sky On July 4th, a group of us were out on a boat on Lake Ontario watching fireworks along the shore. Suddenly, we all noticed a green flashing circle.  It seemed to hover for a moment, and then began moving quickly.  None of us are sure if it appeared or we just did not notice it coming. It had a very bright green glow and seemed to flicker.  It was above 70 degrees above us and was the size of about 10 stars.  We were facing south when we saw it, and it traveled east.  To make sure it was not just a stray firework, we watched it travel and saw it go extremely far off into the distance.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
Rotating cylinder over Rochester, NY city center.;2014-07-05 19:30:00;2 minutes;Rotating cylinder over Rochester, NY city center While attending a 7:05 pm ball game at Frontier Field, I witnessed what I thought originally was an air plane, moving in an easterly direction over the downtown area of Rochester.  After observing the object for about a minute I noticed it had an irregular flashing that looked like a rotating cylindrical shape that moved somewhat irregularly further east.   The object was very small and seemed to be at a very high altitude.  Then it disappeared.  Then, about thirty seconds later a smaller dark object appeared in almost the same place as the previous object, seemed to do a loop and quickly vanished.  The sky was very clear, no clouds, no other aircraft in the area.  My girlfriend also observed the objects as well, though other people around us in the crowd of about 7,000 appeared to not see it.

I have been a star gazer my whole life  I love looking up I have seen some amazing cloud formations  I always thought was natural But as I look back In light of the new videos leaked to the public etc....  One thing stands out  each time a sighting it seems to be involving clouds are they creating them to hide them self's  I saw this on yahoo news   https://www.yahoo.com/news/leaked-navy-video-appears-show-211241985.html  That photo - circle with light That is pretty much exactly what I saw I was scared because no one seemed to notice it but me I pointed it out to a few drivers who seemed to not notice or care  Over the past few years since I saw it  and a few other weird things happening I shrugged off as natural / mother nature  I began noticing people around me some staring at me with an angry a piercing stare -- some pointing their finger at me I have long suspected they are walking among us I have suspected missing people years ago were gathered up to study - breed etc.. so they can walk among us un- detected amazing unique people with extra ordinary skills gifts talent  size strength etc... people who have led us into the computer chip world products etc....  What if all this is right..?? Star Trak - the one where they had a hidden / cloaked building in the mountain studying the people and Data when to expose them / save the people etc...something like that  as our technology - more traveling - cameras etc.. more and more we are seeing things we could not see The writings / pictures on the walls Egypt etc...  given everything In a court of Law  where evidence to be preponderance it  frees a man or convicts a man so must it be proof that it's real  than NOT..

Black circular object floating very high in the sky, flashing white light before disappearing;2020-07-30 15:00:00;30 minutes;Black circular object floating very high in the sky, flashing white light before disappearing Two of us were sitting in a backyard.  The sky had large white/gray clouds that were passing by close to the sun, but there were large patches of blue sky, too.  We saw a circular black object that was extremely high up in the air- too high to be a drone or a bird, and seemed to be above the level of where planes fly, too. It glided across the sky towards the east, but then started gliding towards the west, where the large clouds were.  It did not go into the clouds. It glided slowly, and then as it was getting to a gray area of a large cloud that covered the sun, it flashed bright white light three times, and then went into the cloud. When the cloud passed over the sun, the black circular object was nowhere to be seen. We watched this object for approximately 30 minutes.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
