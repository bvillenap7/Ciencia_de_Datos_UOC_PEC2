I saw three triangle shaped craft fly over my neighborhood.;1996-05-01 01:00:00;10 mins;I saw three triangle shaped craft fly over my neighborhood. It was early in the morning (appx 1:00 am) and I was in my room (second floor) when I looked out the window and noticed bright lights. It appeared to be a low flying airplane and I thought nothing of it. A few minutes later I noticed the same thing and I went outside to my backyard.  A large, slow moving, black, triangular craft with lights was moving across the sky.  Ahead of it, was the object I had previously seen that I thought was a plane, it was the same triangle craft.  There was also a third triangle craft.  They were moving in single file from east to west.  I stood beneath them as they passed and I could hear a very faint hum, it was barely audible.  Other than that, they were silent.  I would estimate that they were 100-300 yards in width. This happened a couple of years ago, so I apoligize for the lack of description.  I submitted this because I saw a report on this website (NTL UFO Reporting Center) from Rochester that also dealt with triangular craft.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285

Triangle craft with white lights, low to ground;2012-07-21 03:05:00;5 minutes;Triangle craft with white lights, low to ground While I was driving I saw a very bright white light. At first I thought it could be the moon peering through the trees but as I continued to drive I saw that it was a moving craft.  Very bright, flashing blue and white.  Was very low to ground and moved slow.  Very low humming sound.  I live near the airport and this was nothing like I've Ever seen before.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
3 lights in different parts of sky at same time.;2014-08-25 22:15:00;1 hour;3 lights in different parts of sky at same time I am reporting this for a friend, his words:   About 10:15, i let the dogs out in the backyard.  I immediately noticed a bright light in the west about 20 degrees up.  It was flickering, i knew it wasn't a star.  I got the binoculars and saw it had flashing lights, red, white and an occasional blue  or green.  A few times a bright beam of pinkish light shot out to the side.  The light stayed in one spot except that it occasionally moved a hair sideways and back, or in a small circle.  I couldn't get the binoculars to focus sharply on it, although I can focus on the craters of the moon or a jet at 35,000 feet.  After a while watching I sort of decided that it was in a triangular shape and was rotating. I walked down the street to get a better look.  At the top of the beach i noticed another light, same deal, out over the lake.  This was not like any of the lights I've seen out there.  When I had a clear view of the sky I saw that there was another one low in the northwest, like over toward Toronto. About 11:15 all three were suddenly gone.  They didn't move away, they went out. I came in the house and was heading into bed when there were five bright flashes in the southern sky, like a flash going off. There was never any noise from any of this.  The flash was bright enough to throw shadows of the trees into the room. In the middle of the night, around 2:30, wife said I can't sleep...aliens.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285

Triangle UFO seen above Rochester, NY.;2018-02-21 20:00:00;15 seconds;Triangle UFO seen above Rochester, NY. On February 21st, 2018, at around 8:30pm-ish, my two friends and I witnessed a triangular shaped UFO near St. John Fisher College.  The object was a large black triangle, with a bright light on each end of the object.  The object also had grey lines on the bottom, which were visible as a result to the light.   My friend pointed it out to us and thought it was a drone.  The more we looked at the object, we realized that it was not a drone, it had to be something else.  We were only able to look at the object for about 15 secs because it vanished out of no where.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285

We were driving home to our fathers house from our mothers house and had turned right onto Carter Rd. in Penfield.  Going down Carter Rd. we saw 3 bright white lights just above the tree line. At first we assumed it was a regular aircraft and said nothing. After 10 seconds it become clear it was traveling low as it was changing position quickly. It moved in a steady straight path as we drove until it was at our right hand side after 20-30seconds down carter rd.  We exchanged words such as do you see that too? And when it became clear this was an unusual event my brother pulled over on the shoulder of the road to get a better view. Just as he pulled over it was passing by us in a smooth unbroken path and we saw it very close potentially less than 200 feet away.  The reason im taking the time to write this is because I think this next part is important. We saw the lights reflection off of the hull and saw the light of the sky, stars etc was black between the 3 lights such that it became visually clear this was one solid object. It gradually disappeared over the trees out of sight going North North East towards Rochester.  We later both drew pictures of what we saw when we arrived home. The pictures showed triangle shapes with 3 lights on either corner. To this day this experience has left me confused and upset.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
