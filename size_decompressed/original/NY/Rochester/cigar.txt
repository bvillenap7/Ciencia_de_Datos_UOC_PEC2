Was sitting back looking at the day sky and noticed a cigar shaped object floating through the sky from south to north. It was silver colored, no noise, just appeared to be floating through the sky. It was identical to a plane with out any wings.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
Silver/Blue cigar shaped hoovering over the lake from west to east;2021-02-04 06:08:00;15 seconds;Silver/Blue cigar shaped hoovering over the lake from west to east About 30 degrees above the horizon, a blue and silver cigar shaped floated from West to East. Motion was very slow and the observation only lasted 15 seconds. Very massive cigar shape floating over the lake Ontario. Looks like a size of silver dollar in the sky. Must be huge judging from the distance of my house to the lake which is 2 miles apart.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
