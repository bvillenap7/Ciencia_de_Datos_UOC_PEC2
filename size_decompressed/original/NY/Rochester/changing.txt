Shape changing craft.;1993-06-30 10:00:00;5 min;Shape changing craft I was standing at the top of the hill (the hill overlooks a four-way stop), and noticed a very, very slow moving plane (so i thought) coming from the right, what caught my attention was how close the object was to the trees and rooftops of the homes on my street.  Also it as completely dark, no lights on the craft,and it didnt make any noise.  I watched the object as it was still slowly moving forward towards the four-way stop. When the object reached the intersection, it was now completely visible.  It was grey, looked like a plane, size of a plane.  The object stoppped right in the middle of the intersection, so now i am at eye level with the object  The object then changed its shape, and turned into a star, it glowed a bright red, orange and maybe yellow, then the object changed its shape again to a really small round craft, and took off into the sky so fast headed toward stars.  I followed the object with my eyes,in secounds it was gone dissapeared in the stars, there was a line of smoke in the sky and within secounds that was gone too!  Back in 92-94 I was a pre-teen I did run home and tell my mother, whom absolutly believed me.   Over the years I moved out of state, and my brothers (we have 10+ years in age difference) still report seeing ufo's all the time over my mothers house!  We think the air space must be something worth investigating. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285

3 witness a  bright star like light at first  hover, and then transform into a multi-lighted object which went out of view.;2012-08-23 09:40:00;5 minutes;3 witness a  bright star like light at first  hover, and then transform into a multi-lighted object which went out of view. Located in the historic neighborhood of Corn Hill, 3 of us went out on the upper porch for a cigarette last night. It was about 9:30 when we went out and we enjoyed the cigarette and layed out to a nice view of the night sky.  After about ten min.  I noticed, a VERY bright, what appeared to be a star overhead and commented that the star must be a planet or something.  I was so impressed by this apparent star, that I decided to take a picture with my cellphone.  For some reason the phones touchscreen wouldn't react.  At that point my two friends, jumped up and commented that it started to move!  The light now seemd to be an object, which emitted two lesser lights of amber and yellow. Silently went in the southeast direction out of view.  Tbe three of us, were in amazement.  This was the first sighting for two of us, and the third person commented that this wasn't his first sighting.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
