Box-shaped UFO Low to Ground with 2 Red & 2 Blue Lights on Bottom Crosses 490 in Rochester;2017-09-16 22:30:00;15 seconds;Box-shaped UFO Low to Ground with 2 Red & 2 Blue Lights on Bottom Crosses 490 in Rochester On aforementioned date and time, my friend and I were on our way to a bar in downtown Rochester.  We both were completely sober at this time.  We were traveling in a westerly direction through the Park Avenue area of Rochester on the 490 North freeway.  It was already completely dark outside, except for some ambient streetlight/city light.  The UFO was traveling in a Northeasterly direction at approximately 25mph and we were traveling about 65mph. I first noticed the UFO as we were driving along listening to music.  At first I said nothing as I noticed the object had no flashing lights, which I've never seen before on any type of flying craft.  As soon as I realized this, I said to my friend half jokingly look a UFO.  I pointed it out to him and then turned down the music.  Just as I did this the bottom lights came more into view, and I could clearly see 4 large in diameter lights mounted on the bottom of the UFO making a perfect square.  The 2 lights leading the way were red, and the 2 lights following were blue.  They were very close to the color of red and blue police lights, however they were large solid lights (not beams or spotlights) that did not blink. The UFO flew just about directly over us as I continued to stare and make as many detailed mental notes as possible while my friend looked as often as he could (he was driving).  My friend immediately agreed that it was very strange and that he had never seen anything like it. We tried to go over what it could possibly be, but since there were no blinking lights (which are required by law on all aircraft) and since the speed was so slow, the only possibility I thought would be a police helicopter, except several things didn't fit.  We heard no helicopter sounds at all, and this UFO only appeared to be about 200-300ft above the ground.  I also researched heavily into what this might be, and nothing matched, including the police helicopters used in the area. I  later asked my friend to describe exactly what he saw so that I could get an independent description of the object.  He immediately said it was box-shaped with 2 red lights and 2 blue lights on the bottom.  I personally couldn't make out anything other than the lights and the square shape surrounding the lights, however I was only focused on the lights, whereas he saw a box shaped object with lights underneath.  Some other information:  the UFO appeared to be about 30ft x 30ft squared on the bottom.  The 4 lights took up all of the space on the bottom of the UFO, which would mean each light had a diameter of about 15ft x 15ft.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
At around 9:30pm may 16 2021 we had a crescent moon so i brought out the telescope to look at the moon. while looking at a the moon ver;2021-05-16 09:30:00;3 seconds;At around 9:30pm may 16 2021 we had a crescent moon so i brought out the telescope to look at the moon. while looking at a the moon very close, i think i was using 9mm lense and had a very clear and close view of every detail on the moon. I watched a rectangle shaped ship go from the bottom of the moon that was lit up by the sun and up to the dark part of the moon. The ufo moved very quick and traveled the surface of the moon in about 3 seconds. I also noticed it was fairly bigger than most of the craters on the moon and it left a shading on the ground as it traveled. I came to the conclusion it must have been massive for me to see it as i did. It had the shape of a rectangle if you rounded off its edges and thinned out the front of it.It caught me off guard so i didnt get many detailed on it but it was dark like black or smokey gray.The ufo had no lights nore did it leave a trail. I watched for several hours after that to see it it would come back around se! eing as it moved so fast but never did. I use the telescope alot to take a look at the moon. its a decent telescope and like i said i get really really close detail to the surface and never seen anything pass by the moon like that or that size or even leaving a shadow on the surface. It was pretty interesting. I sometimes see wierd things fly by but you can tell its usually something in our own atmosphere so i kno the difference between the two. Feel free to contact me.;43.1512153654477;-77.6327614410285
