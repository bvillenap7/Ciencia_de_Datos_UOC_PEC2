What struck was that it was like looking at it through a 90 mm telescope. As I stood there looking at it, it became clearer and closer until it went from the size of a bb to being the size of nickle, up in the sky. It was in the shape of a pulsar with something redish inside of the pulsar golden glow. It was not a shooting star or meteor, no tail no straight trajectory. It approached and then rolled off to my left which would have been due east.;42.7680193612771;-73.6739188622758
