Triangle object stationary then moves fast and turns around......;2003-09-12 23:50:00;2 minutes;Triangle object stationary then moves fast and turns around...... I'm still in shock. I was driving home from my boyfriends house at about 10 of 12 tonight (Friday) and I pulled out of his development, and I always look for the moon becuase you can see it very well from where he lives, but i look up and I see 3 lights just stayin in the sky, so im like thats weird the plane must be having problems, then....it starts to move, and im underneath it and it was not a plane, it was a triagle shaped craft, moving fast, i was on a bridge, it went over the bridge, and once it got to the other side, it started to turn around and come down a bit...then I was out of site of it, I looked and looked but couldnt see where it went to. I never saw anything like it, it had 3 arms so to say, it wasnt circle or oval or big, it had 3 lights and each light was attatched to an arm type of thing. I dont know what exactly it was, or what but Im in shock.;42.7680193612771;-73.6739188622758
Red, green & orange blinking triangle formation.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of a twinkling star, possibly Sirius.  PD));2011-10-10 00:00:00;2 hours;Red, green & orange blinking triangle formation On Sunday October 7th at around 12 midnight I and 2 of my friends saw a blinking light in the sky, larger than a star and stationary in the sky.  This was overlooking the East side of the Tom Hannock Reserviour in Upstate Albany, New York.  We used binoculars to take a closer look and were shocked to see a triangle formation with a red blinking light at the left hand corner, a green blinking light at the right hand corner, and an orange blinking light at the top, the orange light would change to a normal light then back to orange again.  Overall the formation was swirling which created a circle effect, it was go very fast at points, then slow down speed, to me subjectively it felt like it was doing some kind of work, but unless it was a satellite or gas from a star which my friend said could be possible, I feel its worthy to be reported.  It did move slowly across the river, and was directly above the tree line, we saw a plane fly under the formation and the red light was pale and small in comparison.  The best way to describe it was disco lights, the green and red were very prominent, it was wonderful to watch, yet intriguing to find out what it actually is.  We stayed there for 2 hours and it was still there when we left at 2am. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of a twinkling star, possibly Sirius.  PD));42.7680193612771;-73.6739188622758
