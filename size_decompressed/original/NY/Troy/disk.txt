After watching this for about 30 seconds it speed off at a great speed. As soon it was out of sight i started looking for the location of the moon and noticed it to be a bloody full moon [red,yellow,orange].I have seen other objects before but this is by far the best view i ever had of what i think was a ufo.;42.7680193612771;-73.6739188622758
