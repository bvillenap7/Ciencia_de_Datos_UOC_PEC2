State thruway around 10:30 pm noticed orange orbs, looked like when people ski down a mountain at night with candles.  Got off the thruway and pulled over to observe.   As soon as we got out of the car the spheres disapeared except one.   It seemed to move away then disapeared the came back and disappeared again.;42.8667;-74.5992999999999
