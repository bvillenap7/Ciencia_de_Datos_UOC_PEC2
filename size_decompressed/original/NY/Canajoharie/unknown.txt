UFO in area, then a AWAC jet following;2008-09-14 18:58:00;2 minutes;UFO in area, then a AWAC jet following At 6:55 pm on 09/14/08 I went out on my front porch to set on my swing and call a friend of mine who lives 3 miles north of me. My front porch also faces north.  I was talking for about 3 minutes and I noticed an object in the sky going from east to west. I couldn't figure out what it was. I knew it wasn't a plane, jet or hellicoptor. Their was also no sound coming from it. I live in the country and it is very quiet where I live. I told my friend what I was looking at and said it may be a UFO. My friend asked where I was looking and told me they were outside also. They told me they could see it also and could not figure what it was. They also noted that it was silent. I was about to run in my house and get my camera and it suddenly disappeared, I couldn't see it. I asked my friend if they saw it and they also said it is gone, it was just there and it just disappeared. I then siad I bet it was a UFO. about 30 seconds after that I started to hear the sound of a jet. I said to my friend I can hear a jet sound maybe it was a jet. Then seconds after that a jet flew from the south towards where the Unidentified object was. This was the first time I saw a jet like this flying. It was one of those with the dish type radar on top of it. I think they call them AWAX or AWAC. This jet kept flying north. Shortly it was out of sight and you could not hear it anymore.;42.8667;-74.5992999999999
