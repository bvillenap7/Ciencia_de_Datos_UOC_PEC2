UFO object with flashing red, blue and green lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a possible twinkling star.  PD));2010-11-07 00:30:00;1 hour +;UFO object with flashing red, blue and green lights. Last night (11/7) at 12:35 A.M.  we were just going to bed.  My window allows me to look East toward Albany, NY.  I asked my husband to look out the window as I saw a strange object moving in a very strange pattern.   He got up and looked at it as well.  We watched this object for close to an hour before we decided to go to sleep.  We used binoculars and our video camera to observe the object in more detail.  My husband is an amateur astronomer and quickly ruled out a star, planet, comet or satellite.   The object was blinking red, blue and green lights but could not have been a  commercial jet because it would have passed over our house or moved out of sight within a few minutes.  While the object stayed in the same area of the sky it was not stationary.  It changed position in reference to the stars by slowly gaining or losing altitude.  It was impossible to judge the distance from our location but seemed distant relative to our vantage point.  Looking throu! gh our binoculars it was clear that there was a constant undulation of lights with white light being the most prominent, and red and blue being very clear and green only occasionally visible.;42.8667;-74.5992999999999
