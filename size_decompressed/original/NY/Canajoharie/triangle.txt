I was driving along with my boyfriend, when he was telling me of how he saw a large aircraft flying low, that was black with no windows, flew over him last year as we were going downtown to get groceries in Canajoharie, NY.  I then began to look up at the sky, and was observing the stars when I saw what appeared to be a flock of geese perfectly organized.  It happened at 9:23pm.  I then began to examine closer, and it was exactly what my boyfriend saw last year! I pointed to him, and said this one was way bigger.  It was black, triangle shaped, no windows, or lights, and was flying low, and quiet.  It was headed West of us, and moving quite fast.  I started crying because I knew that it was real considering both of us saw it.  I did some research and I believe it was shaped like a stealth plane, but not exactly sure if thatâ€™s what it is.  I hope someone can figure it out.   Thanks! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite serious-minded.  PD));42.8667;-74.5992999999999
