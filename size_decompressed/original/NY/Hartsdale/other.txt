Large transparent object in Hartsdale, NY.;2015-05-16 16:30:00;5 Seconds;Large transparent object in Hartsdale, NY. My mother and myself parked in the parking lot of the shopping center.  As we exited the vehicle, I looked up and saw a tall, transparent object slowly hovering about 25 feet above the tree line, moving slowly to the West.  It appeared to be roughly 15 feet in height, and I could not make out the total with, as the buildings were blocking some portion of my line of sight.  If I were to guess I would estimate the craft was near 30 feet in length.   Due to the transparent nature of the material the object was made of, I could not determine its depth.  I noticed the object because it slightly distorted the images it passed in front of.   The object's structure appeared to almost be made of pipes or bars, similar to the construction of a bicycle frame, but on a much larger scale.   By the time I reached for my phone, the object had floated beyond the tree line and past the buildings, breaking my line of sight.
