A dozen Amber lights flying in a line.;2013-07-10 22:35:00;10 minutes;A dozen Amber lights flying in a line On my way home from work tonight I saw several Amber colored lights in the sky in a line form.  These were individual lights.   At first I thought they were really bright odd colored stars. I pulled over and saw that they were slowly moving across the sky. I watched them for several minutes.  I drove further down the road and there was another vehicle pulled over and 4 people were standing outside the car gazing into the sky.  So I stopped there and got out of my car and watched with them for several more minutes. We heard no noise.  The lights were solid Amber (orange colored).  We don't believe these were airplanes.  They had no other colored lights on them as you would see on a plane.  Also none of us has ever seen a dozen planes silently flying in a line.  The elderly gentlemen I was standing with said they had never seen anything like this before, and in their opinion they were not planes.  The lights flew straight for a while, then headed upwards and were gone.   It was a cloudy night. But the lights were very visible until they went upwards.  WE could not make out an exact shape.  Maybe roundish.   My cell phone would not work fir several minutes after this.   I could not make a phone call.;43.0829;-76.0098
