unidentified flaming creature falling from the sky in Minoa, NY.;2010-08-10 00:00:00;20 seconds;unidentified flaming creature falling from the sky in Minoa, NY. This sighting is a bit of a different kind of U.F.O sighting.   As you may know a U.F.O is any flying object that cannot be identified by the viewer.   What I saw what not a craft or a ship, what I saw was some kind of twisted, distorted creature on fire falling straight from the sky. I was Driving along Saintsville Road in Minoa NY on an August night with my friend.  It was around midnight. This road is very rural with woods on both sides.  It was foggy out.  I was going about 35 miles per hour when from right in from of my car, up in the sky, a flaming creature fell in front of my car.  It was about 8 inches wide.  It was in full flame while it was falling.  Once it hit the ground, it was glowing with embers.  I drove over it because everything happened so quickly. My friend was texting on her phone and I asked her if she had just seen what happened and she didnâ€™t.  I stopped the car and looked behind the car through the back window to prove it was there, and it had apparently disappeared.  But I know what I saw, and it really did happen.;43.0829;-76.0098
