I was at a local carnival, and this oval shaoed craft kept flying by over us.  It would stop, start, dart, circle, stay in one place, etc.  I finally took out my phone and shot a short video if it before it shot off rapidly.  It had red lights on one end and green on the other.  It had NO wings.  It was a clear evening with no clouds.  It made no sound or contrails.;43.0829;-76.0098
