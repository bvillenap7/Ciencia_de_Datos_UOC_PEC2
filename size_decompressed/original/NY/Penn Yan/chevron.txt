Lunar Eclipse UFOS - Illuminated Geese;2003-11-08 20:10:00;1 min 30 sec;Lunar Eclipse UFOS - Illuminated Geese I fast blasted Art Bell last night, after hearing the descriptions of UFO's during the eclipse last Sat. I witnessed three of the same v or j shape over my small village in upstate NY. I was excited at first, by quickly realized that the illumination from town, an orangeish/redish glow, had lit the flocks from underneath giving an illusion of running lights on a large, silent, v-shaped craft. I am an avid skywatcher, and believe the possibility of e.t. involvement in our lives. But for the guests on C2C last night, they can put this one to bed. These lights were geese were headin' to warmer weather.;42.6653999999999;-77.0620999999998
