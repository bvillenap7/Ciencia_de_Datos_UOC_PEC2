On approximately June 15th 2012 my wife and I were coming back from a restaurant in the Penn Yan NY area at approximately 8:30 PM when a white ball of light flew over our heads.  We were in an automobile, the weather was clear, when from the Northeast going to the Southwest a white ball of light flew over our heads at a high rate of speed.   The ball was flying at perhaps five times tree height. It was going at a level line with the tree line not at an angle with the ground. It was perfectly round and about 20 feet in diameter.  It was a very white light going at a speed at least that of a jet.  We watched it for only about five seconds.  It had no flame or tail in back of it.  There was no lightning or bad weather, skies were clear.  We both saw it.  It did light the area around it reflecting light off of the trees.  Again it did not change elevation like a meteor would.;42.6653999999999;-77.0620999999998
