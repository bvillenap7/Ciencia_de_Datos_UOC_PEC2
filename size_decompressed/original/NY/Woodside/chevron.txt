2 Chevrons flying in perfect formation during lunar eclipse.;2004-10-27 22:20:00;3 seconds;2 Chevrons flying in perfect formation during lunar eclipse. I saw the same thing as this report -  Occurred : 10/27/2004 22:15 (Entered as : 10/27/2004 22:15) Reported: 10/29/2004 9:36:55 AM 09:36 Posted: 11/2/2004 Location: New York City, NY Shape: Chevron Duration:1-2 minutes Night of the lunar eclipse, we saw in the sky two gray v-shaped objects flying side-by-side, no lights, no sound.  At approx. 10:15 pm the night of the lunar eclipse, my 13-yr. old son and I were observing the moon inside Central Park (near Strawberry Fields). As he was looking through binoculars at the moon, I was gazing up at the rest of the sky, marveling at the stars (which is a real pleasure when you live in the city). What the hell is that? I said out loud as soon as I saw the phenomenon. Up in the sky, about as high as an airplane would fly over Manhattan, at a 45 degree angle to the south away from the eastern-rising moon, were two separate v-shaped solid gray metallic objects flying side by side, not touching, same speed, apex pointed directly due south. There were no lights and no sound. They were clearly visible against the black, cloudless sky with the city lights & moonlight reflecting their v shape and gray color. They moved together, silently, steadily across the sky toward midtown. We lost sight of them in the lights over mid-Manhattan. Whole episode couldn't have lasted longer than two minutes.  -  The only differences are that I was in Woodside Queens, I was also looking at the lunar eclipse through my binoculars and I actually saw the 2 Chevron shaped objects zip (about 2 seconds) through my field of view just below the moon. They were moving in an easterly direction. They were silent and flying in perfect formation. As seen through my binoculars, they appeared to be flying at the same height as an airplane would be. I didn't really think anything of it because I wasn't sure what it is I saw until I read the report that I copied and pasted in my report. The sighting I had only lasted for 2 seconds, but after reading the report above, I knew that we had seen the same thing.;40.7465;-73.909
