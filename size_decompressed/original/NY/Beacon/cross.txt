Low flying craft over rural city.;2015-03-11 22:45:00;30 seconds;low flying craft over rural city I have been living in Beacon for about 4 months now and have never seen anything fly that low.   I couldn't make out the shape of the aircraft but the lights were in a cross shape, red and white light and some were blinking.   It was flying east to west, about 5 or 6 lights on the front and two or three on the back.   No noise whatsoever.
