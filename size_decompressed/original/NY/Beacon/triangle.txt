Hovering Triangle in Beacon New York;2011-06-04 22:10:00;1 Minute;Hovering Triangle in Beacon New York I was driving on the Newburgh-Beacon bridge towards Beacon, when I noticed a strange object at about 10 o'clock to where I was at first (position wise).  What caught my eye at first were the lights, just positioned differently than on a normal plane's.  It was also lower than where most planes fly around the area, quite low in fact.   As I approached the toll booth I noticed that it was in the same place it had been while I was on the bridge, hovering in place.  As I waited to pay the toll I stared up at it, simply floating in place.  Once I got through the toll, I went to turn around so I could try to get a video of it on my phone (since I didn't want to take one going through the toll and get a ticket), but by then it had vanished.   It was triangular, and not much bigger than a small passenger plane.   Lasted around 1 minute, and made no noise.;41.5097;-73.9634000000001
