I saw a plain from a distance heading toward this object and it moved back in the air quite a distance above the plane as the plane headed toward it's direction. It then stayed above hovering I tried to look through binoculars on a steady point and this object just kept on moving around and I am unable to get a clear look, this is going on as I type this note;41.5097;-73.9634000000001
Flashing, multicolor lights seen over Mount Beacon;2017-02-24 23:42:00;1 hour;Flashing, multicolor lights seen over Mount Beacon I was walking into my kitchen in the dark and noticed an unusually bright light in the sky hovering directly over Mount Beacon.  The round white light seemed to touch down on the crest of the mountain to the right side.   As I watched, a series of smaller multicolor lights (red, blue, and orange) began showing and moving around the larger white light.  This went on for over an hour, with the lights growing MUCH larger, moving, dancing, and finally disappearing.   This is the second time that I have noticed unusual lights in this specific spot on the mountain, and found your site while researching what they might be.   Just moved to Beacon a month ago and have a clear view of the entire mountain.   There's definitely something happening there.  The lights were completely different between the first and second sightings.;41.5097;-73.9634000000001
