Magenta Triangular phenomenon!;2007-11-07 22:00:00;1:00;Magenta Triangular phenomenon! I had just put my baby down for the night and had gone out for a well deserved cigarette. I was looking up at the sky towards the orion constellation and what should appear but a triangular object moving through the sky with the appearance of purple waves.  It is very hard to explain but the colors were of a magenta hue, and looked as if one was pushing an object through water on the surface and created a ripple effect with purple or magenta waves!  It was not moving very fast at first, but then disappeared from sight! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));41.3944;-74.3332
