Unexplained lights and shape in the night sky seemingly paralleling an aircraft.;2014-09-15 20:00:00;1 hour;Unexplained lights and shape in the night sky seemingly paralleling an aircraft. My girlfriend saw what started as an unusual light in the night sky.  It was observed for aprox 30 min then noticed an aircraft overhead.  Object then became bright, then dimmed to reveal a shape of an inverted wye.  Then object became illuminated again moving to the left on the horizontal seemingly paralleling the aircraft and mimicking the strobe pattern of the aircraft.   She then lost sight of the aircraft (plane) and the object was seen doing circular motions and then vanished to the right in the night sky.  There is mention of hearing the actual aircraft (plane) overhead but nothing for the object and we had another sighting on sat 09/13/14 at aprox 2130 hrs as a blinking light white,red,green all at the same time from an object at a great distance.  Object seemed to move within the same area for an extended amount of time before it not seen again.   I almost called the PD to ask if there was helicopter traffic over Middletown but didn't want to come off as a freak.
