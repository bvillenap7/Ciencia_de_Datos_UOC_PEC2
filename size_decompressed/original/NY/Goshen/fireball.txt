orange ball of light moving fast - 1 hour north of NYC - lasted only 1-2 secs before it disappeared - no engine noise !;2002-01-18 22:30:00;2-3 secs;orange ball of light moving fast - 1 hour north of NYC - lasted only 1-2 secs before it disappeared - no engine noise ! ok guys, I'm not exactly sure what this was since it was kind of fast, and took me by surprise, but here it goes: About 10:30pm coming home from home depot, was standing in my driveway taking in the quietness and the clear, cold night. I looked down my street ( I live in a small village about 1 hr north of NYC at the foot of the catskill mountains). All of a sudden I saw an orangish(?) ball of light go from left to right across my street. It was pretty fast, but from what I can recall it seemed to be about 100 feet over the rooftops and I would guess about 200 feet away, but the distance could have been deceptive. It seemed to be about the size of a basketball. It vanished about 1-2 secs later behind the house on the other side of the street. There DEFINATELY was no sound of engines. I'm not really sure if I want to call the police and ask if anyone else had seen anything. They'll think I'm nuts ! I would love to know if anyone else had seen anything. I'm not sure if it was Fri or Sat night , but it was before the recent snowstorm. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates a date of January 26, which is not possible.  We have requested clarification.  We assume he may have in mind the dramatic fireball event seen on January 20, 2002.  We have amended the date here.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) This is from the guy who posted a sighting in Goshen, NY. Again, I am sorry about the mixup of the dates. I checked several sources and the date was DEFINATELY the 18th of January!  I know you said dates were very important, so I checked with several people as to the date of the storm over the long Martin Luther King weekend. It occured approximately 10:30 the previous night- the sky was clear and it hadn't snowed yet, so that would definately would have been the 18th. If you have any questions, you may e-mail me back at this address. Sincerly,  ((name deleted)) ((END));41.3944;-74.3332

2-3 bright lights suspended a couple hundred feet over the farms.;2013-05-22 22:50:00;15 minutes;2-3 bright lights suspended a couple hundred feet over the farms. Heading west on Pumpkin Swamp Road I noticed two bright lights several hundred feet over the farms west of Pulaski Hwy.  I have lived here for eight years and know that there are no antennas in the area.  The area is composed of flat, open farmland.   As I approached the stop sign I opened my car window to hear if they might have been helicopters.  No such luck.  The lights appeared to be bigger than a car.  Upon closer inspection the objects showed no motion other than spinning.  There was vertical or horizontal movement.  I kept going home and told my wife who was leaving for work at the time.  About fifteen minutes later she calls up and confirms they are still there and indeed are spinning.  Furthermore, she spotted a third one further down doing the same thing.   Have been trying to rationalize it but I can't come up with an explanation. Weather conditions were cloudy with lightning in the distance.
