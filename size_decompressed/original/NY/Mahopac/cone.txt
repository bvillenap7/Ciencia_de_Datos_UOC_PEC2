We were standing outside of the car when we saw this array of lights that appeared to be running lights of some sort of flying object.  This was not a plane or helicopter or any sort of craft that we had ever seen before.  It was about 150'-200' above the water and about 300' away from us or off the shore.  The lights were extremely bright and this object was moving very slowly, maybe 15-20mph.  The lights appeared to be in a straight line very close to each other.  One end of the object seemed to come to a point and then goy wider to the other end, almost like a cone shape.   All of a sudden it took off at an amazing, unbelievable rate of speed at the same altitude.  It was now over the woods next to the lake and about 500'-600' away from us it appeared to dive into the trees and disappear, and it looked like it crashed in the woods.  During this whole ev! ent there was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  Even when it appeared to crash in the woods (which should have made a lot of noise) there was no sound at all.  We walked over in the same direction as the crash but there was no sign of any wreckage or landing.   I believe that we called the police but they didn't seem to care or believe us.  I know what I saw that night was not of this world.  It was the most fascinating and scariest thing I've ever seen in my life.;41.3723;-73.7510000000001
