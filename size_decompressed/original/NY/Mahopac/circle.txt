The most amazing thing I had ever seen!;2001-06-26 02:30:00;1 hour;The most amazing thing I had ever seen! Disk in the western sky.  Green and Red flashing lights around perimeter.  Never moved North or South, just desended in the western sky very slowly.  Kept looking until I just saw a perfectly round silhouette.  I think the neighbors spotlight prevented me from seeing the lights through the binoculars once it got lower in the western sky and further away, but with the naked eye I could still see the red light flashing.  This was not a plane!!!!!!!!  When it was closer I observed exactly what I described.  I took pictures but the camera was not the greatest.;41.3723;-73.7510000000001
