Bright, glowing ball of light silently hovered over condo complex, then flew over condos parallel to ground.;1991-04-01 19:00:00;5 minutes;Bright, glowing ball of light silently hovered over condo complex, then flew over condos parallel to ground. UFO sighted early evening hovering right over the tops of a condo complex I lived in. It was a huge, glowing ball of white light, with some visible reddish light at the front.  It was silent and did not move at first.  I watched it for approximately 2 minutes then closed the door.  Several minutes later I could still see the light from the UFO shining through the windows in the top of my front door.  I opened the door and watched it again for about one minute.  My 3 year old daughter then ran up to the door asking Mommy what are you looking at.  Just then the ball of light activated (got brighter) and started moving slowly and silently over the condo complex, parallel to the ground, only about 20 yards over the tops of the condos.  It disappeared from view once it got over the woods behind the condo complex.  Saw no aliens.  Was not hurt.  Was amazed.  NOT a helicopter, weather balloon or any Earth made thing.

Star like object moving flying over Mahopac NY;2012-01-15 19:00:00;1 minute;star like object moving flying over Mahopac NY It was a clear evening.  I noticed how bright the stars were.  Then noticed what appeared to be a star but was moving.  I was definitely up too far to be an airplane.  I then showed the other 4 people I was with and they stated the same thing, its too far up to be a plane.  I think the star (unknown object) was moving south to north.  I was just wondering if anyone else saw the same object or something similiar??;41.3723;-73.7510000000001
