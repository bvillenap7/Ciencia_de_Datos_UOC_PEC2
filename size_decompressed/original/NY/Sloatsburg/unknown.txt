Bright white light too big to be a helicopter hovering over trees, in a blinks eye it shot up into sky.;1994-12-23 21:00:00;30 seconds;Bright white light too big to be a helicopter hovering over trees, in a blinks eye it shot up into sky. I was driving home around 9:30 pm when I saw a really “bright white” light in the sky in front of me.  I live near a wooden area…so the light was above the tree line.  The light was standing still, so I thought it was a helicopter at first, but then I questioned that the light was too big for a helicopter and no sound.  I wanted to get a better look so I blinked my eyes and I saw the light shoot straight up into the air – at an incredible speed – it was gone in a blink’s eye!!!  I remember this event as it was right before Christmas and I had to drive my friend home, and I was 24 yrs old at the time.
