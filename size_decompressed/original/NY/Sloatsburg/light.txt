Shifting white light seen in Sloatsburg, NY;2012-03-08 20:00:00;10 minutes;Shifting white light seen in Sloatsburg, NY While driving south on Seven Lakes Dr. through Harriman State Park, I saw a bright white light to the southwest.  The light grew fainter and brighter intermittently and changed shape and direction.  It seemed like there were other red lights near it (airplanes?).  Unfortunately, as I continued driving, it went behind the tree line and I list sight of it after about ten minutes.  I did not see it again afterward.;41.1552;-74.2032
