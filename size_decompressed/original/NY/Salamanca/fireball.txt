Bright orange object flying silently through the sky;2009-04-19 20:55:00;3 minutes;Bright orange object flying silently through the sky We just returned home and we were walking to the house, my two year old asks, What’s that?   We look up and in the sky there is a bright orange object flying west through the sky.  It wasn’t moving very fast.  We watched its glow as it traveled horizontally through the sky until we couldn’t see it any longer.  It was silent.   The next day a family that lives the next street over saw the same thing, except they said it was the second time they’ve seen it.;42.161;-78.7265
