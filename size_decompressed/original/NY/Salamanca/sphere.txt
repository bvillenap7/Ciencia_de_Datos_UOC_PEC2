Four glowing spheres hovering in the sky.;2013-06-21 22:38:00;4 minutes;Four glowing spheres hovering in the sky I was on my way into work and as I was driving south towards Salamanca I saw two red glowing spheres in the sky.  At first I thought it was just the local radio antenna but realized they were too high in the clear black sky and were not flashing. As I continued toward Salamanca, two more appeared to the left of the first two.  All four hovered together for about a minute before the first two spheres vanished.  Shortly after the first two the second set also vanished. I spoke to a co worker who travels the same route and he two witnessed all four glowing spheres. They were orangish red in color, almost like a fireball and pulsed slightly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.161;-78.7265
