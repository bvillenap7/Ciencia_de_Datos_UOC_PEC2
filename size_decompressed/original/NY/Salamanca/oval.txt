The evening before my son and his friend observed basically the same thing in about the same area as what we observed the following night.   I was getting ready to observe the evening fireworks show, my Dad was cleaning up dog waste in the yard, my kids were in the house.   I was facing south waiting for the fireworks to start when all of a sudden I saw this orange oval fireball like thing,  I thought the fireworks had finally started until I realized they had not.  It looked like this &quotfireball had come straight out of the top of the hill.  I yelled for my dad to look, then ran inside to get my kids. We watched it move towards us and get dimmer until it just disappeared.  That was the first time we saw it.   My kids returned to the house and my dad and I sat down to watch the fireworks.  The second time we saw it the fireworks had started, all of a sudden we saw it again, still south of us but this time more East, we watched it and it disappeared again.   The third time was in about the same place as the first time.  It seemed to rise straight out of the fireworks, it moved northeast a ways and then just disappeared again.   ] The fourth time the fireworks were over.  My dad saw it first and it was more East this time,  It seemed to move towards us for a bit then switch direction and move away from us then it just disappeared like the other times.  We came inside then to discuss what we had seen. I do have pictures  of what I believe was a UFO that my daughter, her friend and myself observed about a year ago.;42.161;-78.7265
