Numerous lights traveling at high altitude in the same direction and at the same speed.;2009-10-07 05:15:00;15 minutes;Numerous lights traveling at high altitude in the same direction and at the same speed. As I looked up into the sky I witnessed a number of lights at a very high altitude traveling from east to west. The lights were not in any distinctive formation but spread across the sky in groups from one to four all traveling at the same speed.  The lights were not close to each other considering the high altitude. The lights filled my field of view and were noticeable wherever I turned my head to look. Higher than jet airliners usually fly over. There were no sound or “wing tip” lights visible. I went into the house to grab some binoculars and returned to find more lights still passing overhead. They were ten power binoculars, but it was like trying to focus on a star. No shape was distinguishable, just light.;43.3076;-77.93
