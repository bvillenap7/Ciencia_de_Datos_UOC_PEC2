I saw this light that was orange- yellow in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of a star or planet, but not sure.  PD));2009-07-29 20:00:00;2 hours;its was very late at night i say this light that was orange- yellow in the sky when i got out of my car to look i just stood there staring up at the light as it got brighter and started to light up the clouds behind it. the weirdest thing is it would get really dark and cold as the light got brighter and then seem to fade out. and then  it would move around to the left and to the right and then back to were it started from. then fade out again then there were 2 of them that would do the same thing getting brighter and fade to a dim light and move around. every time that it would get really bright more would appear there were four of them that would move closer to the land the weird thing is that it did not move alike a air craft or stay in the same place as long as they did they were like the size of marbles in the sky lighting up the water, and right before i left it was like the light were going down in to the water and then waves would get really rough an! d then calm as could be. it was like looking in to head lights off a car but it would not blind your eyes ((NUFORC Note:  If this is a serious-minded report, which we question, then it may be a sighting of a star or planet.  Source elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Interestingly, source indicates that date of event is approximate, a fact which is difficult for us to understand, given that the report was submitted only four days after the alleged sighting.
