Hamlin NY -also seen several times Amber Strange Lights spinning at night??? To Whom it may concern:  03/24/08  Myself and my fiancé` have had another in a series of amber lights show up out of nowhere and no specific pattern of time or duration out at least 3 miles minimum. They sometimes seem above the noticeable water level, at least approximately several hundred feet, In Lake Ontario due North from approximately Hamlin State Park, NY. They appear through 2 sets of different binoculars to be of a spinning and glowing-pulsating nature. I am not a hoaxer and never would be considered abnormal or bizarre. I feel it is my/ our duty to report these now being at least the 7th time since last fall at odd times of night, they also have darted upward out of sight and 1 time seemingly into the water downward. We did witness 1 other time 1 then 2 and 3 all appear and form a triangle all the same kind of amber objects for only about 3-5 minutes and then all of a sudden they were interrupted by a bright very fast blue orb that shot down from the high stratosphere from dues S. West--like a shooting star at the 3 objects and then they all took off very fast in 3 opposite directions. Something is going on that is NOT of the ordinary and if it is something from the military –AKA – US AIR force based out of Niagara Falls, NY they surely would not admit to that.  But at the speeds and they way they seem fixed for minutes is not that likely. We believe there is much more here than we can figure out, thus that is why my best friend thought we should report finally to your site. I hope you can get it checked out somehow and make some others aware in our area/ region being a lower population here. Thank you,  ((Name deleted)) Hilton/ Hamlin NY;43.3076;-77.93
