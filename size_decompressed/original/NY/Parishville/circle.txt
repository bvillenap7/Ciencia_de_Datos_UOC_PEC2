Orange globe like things in sky.;2014-10-14 19:47:00;30 minutes;orange globe like things in sky. We were pulling in driveway and could here jets over head.  We never here them over head at this time of the night.  During the day yes.  We have Ft. Drum probably 65 miles out, so hearing jets doing maneuvers is not uncommon.    Anyway we went into the house and could still here them so went outside to see anything if we could, being a clear a night.  I looked up on the side of the house and I seen what looked like an orange flashlight (globe), light right up then die and then right next to another light right up stayed lit up for little bit, then died out and then ANOTHER. While watching these i noticed possibly a jet doing circles around these lights(globes)  By this time i was like wtf??  Went to grab for phone to video tape but didn't have it so ran into house yelling lights in the sky grabbed phone and kept it on recording.  Again, it's a clear night we can see everything.  I noticed 2 what looked like satellites flying over and then 2 jets (could tell by flashing ! lights) still flying around.  Would get quite for a few minutes and then you could hear their loud rumble roar noise.  I'm guessing that's the after burners? then quite again then that noise again. They were doing circles the whole time. and then they flew off and everything was quiet.;44.5891;-74.7928

We heard jets flying over, must of been from fort drum army base.  Then a globe of light flashed in sky 3 times.  Then jets proceeded to chase it.   After that, big orange balls lit up in sky.  Flashing like a flash light on and off signaling each other, while jets kept hovering in the area like they were chasing them.  Really awesome site to see.  UFO sightings.;44.5891;-74.7928
