Fighters trying to shoot down UFO over Ft. Drum NY?;2003-09-16 22:00:00;30 minutes;Fighters trying to shoot down UFO over Ft. Drum NY? Me and some friends were outside watching satellites and saw some explosions in the sky toward ft. drum. We thought it was a meteor but to our surprise we saw a flashing light moving across the sky at a high rate of speed. The object changed directions and stopped many times. It would move almost out of site and then rapidly zoom over ft. drum. What looked like several fighter planes attempted to follow it and more bright orange fireballs appeared behind the UFO. We could here jets going to afterburners and the object would zoom away again only to return after several seconds to be fired upon again. Truly amazing!  The sky was clear and the milky way was clearly visible. ((NUFORC Note:  We received no other reports from this area of New York, so we are unable to confirm the report.  PD));44.5891;-74.7928
