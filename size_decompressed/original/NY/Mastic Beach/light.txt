Bright light over NY;2007-08-18 04:40:00;less than a minute;Bright light over NY My husband and I work very early mornings doing deliveries.  I have always been fascinated with the stars and take every available opportunity to look up at them while working.  So was the case today, August 18, 2007, like around 4:40am.  I looked up and saw what I thought was a shooting star but immediately decided that it could not be one because it continued moving and was very bright.  I told my husband who immediately saw it.  We decided that it was impossible for it to be an airplane because it was moving very fast.  My husband looked down for a second and lost track of it, but I didnâ€™t.  The light continued moving and suddenly began to turn, up and down and left and right, as if it was trying to avoid hitting something up there.  Eventually, I too lost track of it.  Afterwards my husband and I were talking about what we had seen and realized that we were looking at two different objects going on two different directions his was going north and mine south east.;40.7616;-72.8508
