East-nor;2012-05-17 23:23:00;3 minutes;I live on the south shore of LongIsland on a flight path from JFK airport where passenger jets often fly when leaveing the US.  East-northeast.  There were two jets timely apart very high, the trees leaves were not bloomed so i had a direct view.   Then i saw a red-dark red sphere glowing in the sky on the same trail of the jets but it moved south then north and stoped as if it new I saw it.  I shined my mag lite at it and it came closer to observe me, it was very fast then stoped again, then flew right above me and stopped. It was a deep red-maroon with a motion of color ball shape and silent.  It approched me from the east stopped above me, seemed nerveus shakey then took off to the west very fast without a sound and then disapeared.;40.7616;-72.8508
