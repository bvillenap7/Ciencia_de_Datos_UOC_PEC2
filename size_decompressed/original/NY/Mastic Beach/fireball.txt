Fireball in southeast sky that changed shapes.;2020-01-12 18:57:00;4 minutes;Fireball in southeast sky that changed shapes. Fireball was hovering low outside my bedroom window, facing south.  The fire started to move upward and then backward.  The fireball moved slowly east in a up and down zigzag motion.  I heard numerous car horns beeping in the distance.  Lost sight of the fireball as it moved southeast.  I have a video and the fireball was not shooting across the sky like a meteor.  I called Suffolk County Police to make a report.;40.7616;-72.8508
