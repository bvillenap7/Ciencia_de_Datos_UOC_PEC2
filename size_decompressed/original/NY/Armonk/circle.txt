Bright red/orange round object seen right over the horizon.;2017-11-26 23:40:00;10 minutes;Bright red/orange round object seen right over the horizon. My son sighted a bright red /orange glowing round object sitting right over horizon from his bedroom window.  He thought, initially, that it looked like a full harvest moon but the real moon was a crescent in another part of the sky.   I was able to see it as well and then we took pictures of it before it disappeared from sight a few minutes later.;41.1393;-73.7012
