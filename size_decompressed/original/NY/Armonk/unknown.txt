U.F.O Spotted Rising from the trees in Armonk New York!;2009-01-25 20:38:00;30-45 seconds;U.F.O Spotted Rising from the trees in Armonk New York! Hello I am a 13 year old boy and I just saw a U.F.O on Route 22 in Armonk, New York.   I was driving in the car with my mother when I looked to the left and spotted an disk like object rising from the trees.  I continued to watch the object while I said, Oh my god! to my mother.    We both stared at the. object while it flew and approx. 2000 feet in the air above the road and continued onward to itâ€™s destination. My mother and I both agree on the fact that the most bizarre thing about the object was the color of its lights.  The lights were Red, Blue, and Green and were placed in a triangle like formation on the bottom of the object.  As the object passed over, I thought I could clearly make the out a half-moon shaped object flying over.  My mom thought it could have been an airplane but I know what I saw.   Hopefully someone else will report a sighting like this and I know that it was one of the strangest things I have ever seen.;41.1393;-73.7012
