Flying sphere hovering above us, shining light and then disappearing;2005-06-30 00:00:00;seconds;Flying sphere hovering above us, shining light and then disappearing My friends and I were in the middle of a wildflower field in a nature preserve after hours.  Several of my friends were sitting on a rock nearby, but three or four of us were standing in a circle in the grass.  It was very dark and we could barely see each other.   All of a sudden there was a flicker of light above us, like a camera flash.  I also heard a whirring sound.   We looked up immediately and saw a sphere, a ball, with light emanating from its bottom.  Then the light disappeared, it was as though the source of the light closed up.  The sphere hovered for a moment or so and then flew threw the air and disappeared just several feet away. The sphere was rather small and came very near our heads.  I couldn't have touched it if I reached up, it was further up than that, but it was rather close. This happened several years ago, but I remember it clearly and there are several people who can corroborate it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

They were fully metallic, at first i thought it was a plane, and then i remembered all of the UFO movies that i watched and concluded that it was a UFO.
