At times it would pause and then move erratically in movements that just made no sense and then at times seemed like patterns of right angles repeating them selves. at other times when in a pause mode, it would appear as if different colors would pulse of red, blue and white. Then at another point in time two others appeared along side of it doing the same similar movements but were not around as long as the first one to make other observations of. As the sun started to rise and the stars  started to dissapear this shiny circuler object still appeared faintly. At times the object would dissapear and reapear when a normal air craft would circle around about once every 15 minutes as if doing some kind of surveilance of the object them selves.  Then all of a sudden it was gone and we were all left in shock because we know that what we saw was not from this world. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
