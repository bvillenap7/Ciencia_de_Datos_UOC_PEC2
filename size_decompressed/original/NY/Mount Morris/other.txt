Followed by something;2006-02-24 02:30:00;45 mins;Followed by something My girlfriend and I were sitting on a country road around 2:30am to switch driving positions.  We noticed behind us about half mile back near the road we turned off shadow looking objects (no apparent shape) coming closer up the road. This was after seeing a orange beam come straight down behind us while driving up the road we turned off. My girlfriend started to drive again while i was in the extended cab of our truck. We turned onto a main road then off onto the next road down from the one we turned off and drove up about a half mile and stopped. It had snowed during the day and the road was covered and a very light snow was falling.  We were looking behind us and near the end of the road alittle up from the main road we could see a white light that looked like it was a car with just its dome light on. It went off then came back on closer to us and then off and then we started to drive again. Looking back it seemed as if there was something right behind us, a black shadow of something and a red beam flashed by the truck.  We then came to a stop sign and turned left onto the road we live on, about 100 ft after turning it seemed like we were in a blizzard with snow flying heavy and blowing very hard. Our satellite radio lost reception during this. The blowing snow stopped after about 10-15 seconds and then totally stopped as if a helicopter had gone right over head.  There was no noise of any kind and we returned home 2 minutes later. 2 hours after arriving home there was a bright white light in the lower sky outside our house moving in circular patterns for about 40 minutes. My girlfriends mother witnessed this light it then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));42.6862;-77.8627
