There was a very loud roar which was above us travelling from west to east.  We thought it was an earthquake. The phone was ringing.  I answered the phone, it was another female friend who actually saw the craft fly west to east across main st.  It was travelling very fast, had dark gray smoke coming out the back, was dark gray in color, elongated triangle in shape, at only about 700 ft. in altitude.  The size was incredible.  It was as long and as wide as an aircraft carrier.  On the news that night there was a report of metior showers.  The object was a craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

On January 22, 2015, I was heading south on route 408 near mount Morris, NY.  It was a clear night. About 8.00pm. As I was driving, I looked up and seen like a street light up above the regular street lights.  It was heading in the same direction as I was.  When I pulled over and got out of my car it did a 380  ((sic.  180??)) degree turn and started heading back toward me. As it was coming back I started taking pictures with my cell.  It was triangular with a red tail light.  And it had blue lights on either side.  The white light appeared to be a flood light. There was no sound.
