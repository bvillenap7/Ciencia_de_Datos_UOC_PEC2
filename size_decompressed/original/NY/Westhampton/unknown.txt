Large, stationary object app. 100ft above ground, with lights					;1998-03-26 21:30:00;10 secs;Large, stationary object app. 100ft above ground, with lights					 At about 9:30pm on 26th March, I was driving east along Route 27 between exists 62 and 63 when I spotted a large object in the sky.  It was on the north side of the highway and appeared to be stationary.  I watched it as I drove for about 9 or 10 seconds, but it did not appear to move.   I asked my father, who was sitting in the passenger seat and was more familiar with the area what it was, and he said it looked like a UFO.   The object looked like a very large plane, with illuminated windows and some lights around the sides.  I could not make out the outline of the object, but it seemed to be somehat triangular.  It was about 100 feet off the ground and about double the size of a large aircraft.  It made no noise. When I returned to that spot in the daytime, I saw no structure that large that it could be.   The area is undeveloped and flat with no large structures of any kind except for two gas or water tanks about three quarters of a mile from the highway, but they had nothing that looked like windows and they were small and spherical.;40.816;-72.6638
