A Single craft with 4 lights changing shape going north over Auburn Ny;2010-04-14 09:50:00;45-55 seconds;A Single craft with 4 lights changing shape going north over Auburn Ny On Wednesday, 4/17/10, at approximately 9:50 pm, three of my friends and I were walking through Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn, NY.  About 100 feet from the Fitch Ave. entrance we noticed what seemed to be a very large craft right above our heads.  We could see 4 white lights defining the shape of a misshapen square and it appeared to be a single craft since the stars behind it could not be seen. At first, the UFO seemed quite close to us and moved fairly slowly.  But as it moved away it began to change shape, move faster and rise higher into the sky.  As the craft moved away from us in a Northern direction, the lights rotated into a triangle form with the point facing forward.  The UFO also began to speed up.  It was moving faster than any other aircraft we have ever witnessed before.  It had also seemed to reach an elevation comparable to an airplane as it headed farther North.  But unlike an airplane the craft never made a sound. We watched the UFO until our eyes couldn’t track it any longer.  We kept a watchful eye to the sky for a bit longer but none of us saw any other unexplained occurrences.  My friends and I have never observed anything like this before.  We are all in agreement that this UFO was not any man made craft that we know of.;42.9285;-76.5590999999997
