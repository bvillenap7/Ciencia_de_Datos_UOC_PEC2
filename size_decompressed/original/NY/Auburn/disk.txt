UFO encounterance Auburn NY-Skaneateles NY;2009-11-15 14:05:00;5 minutes;UFO encounterance Auburn NY-Skaneateles NY I was driving on route 5&20 with my girlfriend and her brother, on the way to Skaneateles from Auburn NY. I spotted something just above the tree line, three bright lights that were very intense.  Mind you that the trees were at least 100 feet tall, and we were a good 1 ½ mile from them, also it was midday and partly cloudy. I yelled to the rest of the car what is that!?  And we came over the hill for town hall road and saw it still had not moved, we saw that about 15 other cars were pulled over on each side of the road, with everyone out staring at the object with cameras and cell phones.  We attempted to get several pictures but we couldn’t because of the low quality of my camera phone. The object stayed in the same place for a good couple of minutes.  The object began to lift and as it did we all heard something that sounded like an electric engine winding up.  The object at this point was about ¼ mile away and yet it looked like it was right in front of me, I’d guess it was a few hundred feet in diameter.   The lights flicked off and I saw it had the reflectivity of polished aluminum or steel but was so light of a color that I had never seen metal that color before.  The trees below the object didn’t move as it changed from a hover to achieving lift, which was weird because it was not that high above trees directly below it.  The object then got higher and higher then it seemed to disappear.   After the object left (about 2 minutes later), we saw a dual prop plane come from the same direction the object was first sighted in, the aircraft circled the spot a few times were the object was then left back in the direction it came.   We all were left confused and with many answers, anyone who have may been there please post pictures!;42.9285;-76.5590999999997
