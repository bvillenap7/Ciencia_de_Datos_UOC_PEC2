I was sitting on my deck with my neighbor and noticed a light coming toward me in the sky.  I told my neighbor it looked like a plane was on fire.  As is came closer it was traveling  at the same speed and height.  I realized it was not a plane and was not on fire.  It was round.  We watched it as it passed overhead thinking it was a shooting star.  Then decided it could not be since there was no tail and the way it was traveling.  As it went off in the distance the shape of it being a circle was even more clearer and it appeared grey.  The fire appearance was on the bottom of the craft.;42.9285;-76.5590999999997
I saw a solid bright red circular object descending and headed south.;2014-08-01 22:20:00;1 minute;I saw a solid bright red circular object descending and headed south. I was standing in my backyard and when I looked up, I saw a solid, bright red, circular object.  It was flying at a low altitude and it passed right above me, overhead.  The object was traveling south and it was descending at a very slow speed.  It appeared to be under intelligent control, it was not free falling or flying erratically. It lasted about a minute and then it faded out to black in the nightime sky and completely disappeared, almost like it had become cloaked by turning invisible.  The object had no visible flashing lights,it was only bright red in color.  There was no sound whatsoever.   The sky was mostly cloudy and it had just rained about 40 minutes prior to the sighting.   There was also a plane spotted to the west of where the ufo was located at the same time.;42.9285;-76.5590999999997
