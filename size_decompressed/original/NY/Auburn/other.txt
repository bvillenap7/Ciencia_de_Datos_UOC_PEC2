To the W, I saw huge ball if light.  It was too big to be a star or planet.((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by airline employee.  PD));2017-02-14 06:20:00;10 minutes;While laying in bed this morning looking out window to the west saw huge ball if light.  It was too big to be a star or planet so watched to see if it moved.  I thought maybe it was a search helicopter.  It appeared to remain stationary then made diagonal move upward and proceeded to move directly in straight in direction of our house.  Giant light not radiating color.   I ran downstairs as my brother was up getting his son ready for school.  He and I ran to the window and the unusually large aircraft...long wing span with lights across entire length of wing span.  It continued in straight line in direction of Skaneateles, NY.  It was not loud.  I have looked in news however have not seen anything posted or report of anyone else seeing it.   I was a Flight Attendant and know aircraft...this was not ordinary at all.  Highly unusual due to enormous size, wing span and amount of lights.  I would really like to know what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by airline employee.  Jupiter currently is quite prominent in the eastern sky, but if the object was, in fact, moving, it could not have been Jupiter, obviously.
