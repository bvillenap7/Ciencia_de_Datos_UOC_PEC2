Several objects from south east.;2014-08-23 22:00:00;15 minutes;Several objects from south east. Saw seven objects that appeared as fireballs traveling at a slower velocity than a meteor.  Two of the objects witnessed appeared to have mass and could see the red-orange glow reflecting off the rest of it.   Seven of them appeared over the span of about twenty minutes, coming in from the east south east and heading west north west at about a 30 degree angle.  At one point in their travel they seemed to veer towards the north and blink out either due to cloud cover or some other reason.;42.9285;-76.5590999999997
Orange flaming ball of fire, flying west to east, with no sound or navigation lights.;2015-07-31 21:00:00;30 seconds;Orange flaming ball of fire, flying west to east, with no sound or navigation lights. I first observed an orange flaming light rising in the western sky.  The object was in the shape of a ball of flame.   It continued in a easterly direction and continued to accelerate in a straight path.  At times the clouds would obscure the light.  There was no sound or navigation lights.   The flame eventually faded but a dark object could still be seen flying to the horizon in Eastern sky.  Still no navigation lights could be seen.   I am a police officer and would not have posted this sighting unless I thought to be unusual and difficult to explain.
