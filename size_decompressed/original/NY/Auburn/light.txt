Myself and 3 other co-workers saw 15 red orbs of light come off the ground while we were looking South, the orbs were traveling East and circling each other across the horizon.  It looked as though each orb of red light was separate, but hard to tell since it was off in the distance and also dark out.  The lights were not flashing or blinking, it was solid red light.   We watched for about 5 minutes until they vanished out of our line of sight.;42.9285;-76.5590999999997
Round light traveling between two airplanes.;2015-05-23 02:50:00;30 seconds;Round light traveling between two airplanes. On May 23, 2015, at approximately 2:50 am eastern time, one airplane, with flashing lights, was seen heading a northeast direction towards Syracuse. Approximately 4 seconds after the plane passes, I observed a round light that was constant, moving in the same direction as plane but slower, no flashing lights. About 4 to 5 seconds after light passed, another plane coming from same direction but appeared to be more north but heading same path as the first plane and light object, this one also had flashing lights, indicating to me as a airplane. My first guess is it may have been a satellite. My background would indicate that I may be paranoid, however I felt the need to report Even if it could have been a common manmade object.  I wouldn't be able discern. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.9285;-76.5590999999997
