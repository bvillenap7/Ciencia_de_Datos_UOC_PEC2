5:30 AM PAPERGIRL WITNESSES HUGE, SILENT, GRAY, LOW OBJECT OVER HOUSE TOP ROOFS ON CITY ST.;1984-04-23 05:30:00;10 SECONDS;5:30 AM PAPERGIRL WITNESSES HUGE, SILENT, GRAY, LOW OBJECT OVER HOUSE TOP ROOFS ON CITY ST. I AM NOT SURE OF THE EXACT DATE, I REMEMBER HOWEVER, WEARING A JACKET, SO I'M THINKING IT WAS EITHER LATE SPRING, OR EARLY FALL OF 1984.  I WAS ABOUT 13 OR IF IT OCCURED IN FALL I WOULD HAVE  BEEN 14 YEARS OLD, WHEN AT APPOX 5:30 AM IN AUBURN, NY ON SEYMOUR ST, I WAS DELIVERING THE MORNING NEWSPAPERS.  IT WAS STILL DARK.  AS I WAS WALKING UP THE SIDEWALK, I HAD THE STRANGE SENSASTION AS IF I WAS BEING WATCHED, SO I LOOKED UP, AND I SAW THIS HUGE TRIANGLE SHAPED OBJECT HOVERING OVER THE HOUSE TOP ROOFS, IT WAS SO LOW, THAT I SWORE I COULD TOUCH IT, THEIR WAS NO SOUND AT ALL.  I REMEMBER STOPPING TO STARE AT IT FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS I WATCHED IT.  I SAW A RED PULSATING LIGHT IN THE CORNER, AND VERY INTRICATE PIPING ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE WING. I KEPT THINKING THAT THIS IS NOT AN AIRPLANE, I WASN'T SURE WHAT IT WAS.  I WAS JUST IN AWE, I LOOKED AWAY AND THEN LOOKED BACK AND IT WAS GONE. THEIR WAS NO TRACE OF IT ANYWHERE.  BUT HERE IS WHAT'S WEIRD, BECAUSE, I NORMALLY FINISHED MY PAPER ROUYTE AT ABOUT 7:00 AM , SO THAT I COULD GO HOME AND GET READY FOR SCHOOL, TO CATCH THE BUS, HOWEVER THAT MORNING I WAS 30 MINUTES LATE, AND I REMEMBER RUNNING, AND NOT BEING ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHY I WAS SO LATE, AS I WAS APPROACHING THE STREET TO HEAD HOME I LOOKED OFF INTO THE EASTERN SKY AND I SAW A HUGE GLOWING ORANGE SUN, LIKE NO SUN I HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE, OR  HAVE EVER SEEN SINCE.  EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT MORNING HAS NEVER FELT NORMAL TO ME, WHENEVER I REMEMBER IT I ALWAYS WANT TO IMAGINE THAT I WAS IMAGINING IT, BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE IT WAS SO REAL.  I RUSHED HOME TO TELL MY PARENT'S WHAT HAD HAPPENED, AND THEY OF COURSE THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE ME, THEY SAID I HAD AN OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION.  SO, THE REASON I AM WRITING 22 YEARS LATER IS BECAUSE, I RECENTLY WATCHED A PROGRAM ABOUT ALIEN ABDUCTIONS, IN WHICH THE VICTIMS HAD DESCRIBED THE SAME THING I WITNESSED, DURING THE SAME YEAR, AND CLOSE TO WHERE I WITNESSED THE SAME THING.  I THOUGHT ALL THESE YEARS THAT MAYBE I DID IMAGINE THIS THING, BUT NOW THAT I SEE SIMILIAR REPORTS I AM STARTING TO THINK IT REALLY DID HAPPEN.

Low flying-------triangle---- with at least 3 very bright white lights----------- Makes NO noise.--- Comes out on clear nights---;2011-04-08 01:00:00;10 minutes;Low flying-------triangle---- with at least 3 very bright white lights----------- Makes NO noise.--- Comes out on clear nights--- I was over at falcon park in auburn new york with my friends at about 1:00 in the morning... I seen a triangle shaped aircraft fly **VERY** low and going at a slow pace... it had 3 white lights one for every ending point....   As the aircraft started too fade beyond the tree line heading towards skanneatlas i seen 3 more white lights too make a combined total of 6... The lights were very bright...  And if this was a government stealth plane the why would they have bright lights like that??... This is very strange... and i seen the same thing happen 3 weeks prior too this when i was walking home from my girlfriends house...  I seen the same ship fly over bradford park heading towards owasco.. this one only had 3 lights.  i didnt see 6 lights appear... I did take some photos on this kids android that we were with... and a black truck pulled up next too us too...  Im not sure if it was because we were loitering or something but it was all very strange....  it was very very beautiful and clear night when both sighting occured.... I would never make up something like this..  i swear too this sightings authenticity..  2 times within 30 days i have seen this aircraft..  I guarantee it will be back around...  Next time ill be equipped with a video camera.;42.9285;-76.5590999999997
Unbelievable star that turns into a UFO.;2011-10-05 22:00:00;about a few minutes;Unbelievable star that turns into a UFO. The Craft that I saw was spotted by me at around 10:30pm.  I was on my back deck star gazing and enjoying some beverages.  When I looked in the sky to what appeared to look like a star but it was shimmering orange. I t stayed stationary for at least a minute.  I took my eyes off it and just figured it was a star.  Then I decided to check and see if it was still there.  When I looked it accelerated and started breaking apart. It looked like it had a spot light in the front as it was breaking apart.  It flew right above my head in the night sky.  As it flew above my head it formed a triangle shape and had 3 red lights and a black mass in the middle.  It continued threw the sky until I could no longer see it. I strongly believe what I saw was not from this planet.  I do not know the exact trajectory or elevation. If I had to guess I saw it rise in the West and then fly above me and disappear in the East.  Elevation I would say when it was at its highest point maybe a couple thousand feet but it was not flying extremely high at all. It did accelerate quickly and then stop on a dime and break out into the triangle with red lights then it cruised slowly away. I thank you for your time what I saw was incredible I have also seen 4 other UFO's through out my life time.  It is an incredible adrenaline rush to see them.  I have had witnesses before but this time I was by myself.;42.9285;-76.5590999999997
Triangle-shaped craft splits in perfect halves and goes in opposite directions.;2014-04-01 22:00:00;15 minutes;Triangle shaped craft splits in perfect halves and goes in opposite directions. My father who is retired law enforcement and myself were in our back yard trying out the star map on my new tablet at 10:00pm.  I was holding my tablet above our heads and looking at the shapes on the constellations, when all of a sudden my tablet which was at 90% charge shut down, and we were unable to get it back on.   We then decided to grab our phones from our pockets to download the same application and continue were we left off, but our cell phones were both off and unable to turn on as well.  So we just started looking at rhe sky thinking nothing of it when my mother opens the back door and says to my father the lights in the house are flashing on and off rapidly.  We then notice both house's next to ours are doing the same.   So my father being retired law enforcement starts to access the situation when he says to my god, look at that.  Me and my mother of course look and we all see this triangle shaped craft that kind of appeared out of nowhere.  It was coming from one horizon to the other.  When it became closer to us we realized the massive size of this craft and how low to the ground it was.  It couldnt have been more then 5 or 600 feet up.   As it slowly moved over our block the flickering of the lights became more rapid and then as it came overhead the lights were completly out on the entire block, it became almost pich black.  As it heads toward the opposite horizon it gained altitude and then completly stopped in the sky.  Then the triangle separated perfectly in half.  It hovered there for two or three minutes and without making any sound both halves went in opposite directions at an incredible rate of speed.   Once the craft took off almost instantly the lights in our house along with every house we could see turned on at the same time.   I have never heard my father say anything about ufo or anything close to it.  Being a police officer, it could have jeopardized his career and credibility.   But my parents and I could find no reason for what could have caused for such strange things in what seemed like the longest 15 minute of my life.;42.9285;-76.5590999999997
I saw a bright orange triangle with no sound flying southeast.  ((NUFORC Note:  Overflight of ISS.  PD));2016-03-29 20:14:00;4 minutes;I saw a bright orange triangle with no sound flying southeast. At 8:14 P.M., I went out to the mailbox to retrieve the mail.  As I closed the mailbox,a bright pulsating orange light just above the tree line caught my eye.  It was moving very slowly to the southeast with no sound.  The object intensified in brightness and then faded somewhat as it traveled in a straight line to the east.  It was clearly under intelligent control as it did not deviate from its flight path.   I then ran inside and grabbed my binoculars and then ran back out the back door to my back yard.  The object then disappeared and then reappeared about 20 seconds later.  I raised my binoculars and focused them in on the object and it changed from a solid orange object to a triangular shaped object with three orange lights.  There was an orange light on each corner forming a perfect triangle.  The object crossed directly in front of me,stopped and then disappeared into thin air.  It did not ascend or descend.It simply vanished,as if it had cloaked itself invisible.  I witnessed it disappear while viewing it through the binoculars.  I had the distinct feeling that the object was watching me, just as I was watching it.  The weather was not a factor, as it was a crystal clear starry night. No other aircraft was spotted near this object when I saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Overflight of ISS.  See link below.
