Large black triangle with pulsating, flashing white and red lights over north Center Moriches;2011-10-17 21:30:00;5min;Large black triangle with pulsating, flashing white and red lights over north Center Moriches Â I live in center Moriches and for the past week I have had 3 sightings. 2 were in the area of sunrise highway and exit 69. Bolth were of a triangular black craft with approximately 6 pulsating, flashing lights. The object hovered silently and gently moved through the sky at around 5 miles an hour to possible even slower. I was about 200 ft away from the craft at one point and managed to take 1 photo and one short video that did not come out clear but perhaps with some photo cleaning I can get a clearer view. On the same night of 10/17/11, I seen a faint light way over head that Seemed to be a satellite. All of sudden the object became extremely bright and maneuvered a zig zag pattern at astounding speed. please note that this event happened 1hr prior to sighting of the triangle.;40.7957;-72.7974
