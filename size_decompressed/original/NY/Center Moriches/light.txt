2 white objects traveling closely behind a plane;2002-09-28 20:15:00;1 minute;2 white objects traveling closely behind a plane We were at a birthday party for a 20 year old where there was no alcohol or any other mind altering substance being used(other than cigarettes). I hold a BA in Human Relations and female 47yrs, the other 2 witnesses who with me walked to another part of the yard to keep the objects in view were male about 40 and 50 yrs of age, I'm not sure of their backgrounds. The first object we believe was a plane with the usual red/green blinking lights, heading east to west, following that was a white light moving about the same speed, not fast but steady, but with no blinking lights . One of the other eye witness made the observation that it was much too close to the first object to be a plane because they're  not allowed to fly so near each other. The third object was the same short distance following the 2nd object and was also a white light with no blinking lights.We watched untill they were out of our view due to trees blocking the sky. There was no sound heard ((NUFORC Note:  The sighting cannot be ascribed to the International Space Station, which had passed over the New York City area approximately 15-20 minutes earlier.  Also, the ISS does not orbit to the west.  PD));40.7957;-72.7974
