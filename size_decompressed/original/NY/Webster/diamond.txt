It certainly did not resemble an airplane in the sky.  It seemed to me that it was not in earth orbit but fairly close. It was moving at a fast pace but not as fast as comet or something like that.  It was definitely moving faster than satellite and it was brighter than any star in the sky.  The light was strong and consistent it had no flashes or other colors on it.  I heard no sound at all coming from it.  It was traveling in a straight line at first.  then a few mins later it just disappeared in a matter of seconds.  It stopped moving across the sky and looked like it was moving away from us and intense speed.  It was compleaty gone in a matter of seconds.;43.2138000000001;-77.4575000000001
