Light taking off from the ground.  ((anonymous report));1991-06-15 05:00:00;10 seconds;Light taking off from the ground. While delivering the morning newspapers in the outskirts, farm area, of Webster, NY, a white light soared from ground level in a field at about a 40 degrees into the sky.   I did not see any solid object.  Only the light.  It was over in a few seconds.   I do not remember hearing any sound.

I thought it to be an orb at the time, BUT after seeing a video showing something similar caught on camera at the Space Station, I'm wondering if it could be a space craft.   I've never seen anything this weird.  It was worm-like shaped, very bright white light, rays above and below.  One end looked solid, but the rest looked like pure light.  It didn't change position, but dipped near (my) the left, and then further down the object, as like waves.  I'm sending the photo, so please look for that.  I would like to hear from someone with an opinion as to what this could possibly be. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Very loud bang and bed shaking.;2016-12-05 04:00:00;few seconds;very lound bang and bed shaking I was wondering if anyone besides my husband and myself experienced shaking of their home and a VERY LOUD bang last night in Webster, NY.  I'm not sure of the exact time.  We were woken by this loud banging sound and bed shaking.  I called RG&E to see if a transformer had blown - no it hadn't.;43.2138000000001;-77.4575000000001
