Object was not flashing any lights, only steady illumination. Outside of work smoking a cigarrette with 2 other coworkers, when i looked up in the sky and saw this orange light in the sky, far brighter than any other of the stars out that night. I didnt think anything of it and continued to puff my cigarette and converse with my coworkers, but after about 30 seconds i noticed how fast this object traveled from the horizon to almost overhead. I told the others  Do you see That! We all looked in amazement as it silently flew over our heads. There were planes in the area, and this one was so eeirily different. It did not strobe or flash. It was orangeish from  afar, but overhead it was a soft amber followed by a number of red lights, i would like to say 3, but too hard to tell. It came from the eastern horizon to completely across the sky to the western horizon in less then the time it takes to smoke a cigarette. i would say less then 4 mins. I had an uneasy feeling in my stomach as i watched it go by..;43.2138000000001;-77.4575000000001
