groups of white-ish silver shapes moving quickly from right to left in a horizontal line;2005-11-08 14:45:00;15-20 seconds;groups of white-ish silver shapes moving quickly from right to left in a horizontal line My son and I were walking home from school when we saw throught the tree, against the blue sky, these white-ish silver shapes moving quickly from right to left in a horizontal line.   I first thought they were birds but when I looked longer there was no wing movement.  There were 3 groups of 2-4 each, spaced about 1-2 seconds apart.  It was hard to tell how far away they were therefore hard to determine their actual size.   Although I've been interested and curious about UFO's for some time this is my first sighting.
