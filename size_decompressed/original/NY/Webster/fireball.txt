V-shaped cluster of red-orange fireball objects, travelling west to east, Monroe County, NY.;2015-05-22 23:30:00;5-10 minutes;V-shaped cluster of red-orange fireball objects, travelling west to east, Monroe County, NY. I was walking my dog in neighborhood tract, and when she stopped to sniff, etc., I turned and noticed 6 or 7 reddish-orange objects tracking accross the sky.  They seemed to be moving almost in a vee, like when geese migrate, but at one point, they clustered together closer, then began to travel again...the direction was west to east.  I lost sight of them in the tree line, then saw them again in the distance, when they seemed to disappear.  I turned to walk that way in the direction that I had initially come from, to see if I could see anything else.  Over the next few minutes, I saw several single fireball orbs coming from the west, and heading east.  No noise was heard with any of these objects my dog (a hypervigilant border collie) did not react to anything.;43.2138000000001;-77.4575000000001
Bright red/orange fireball spotted in southeast sky;2015-07-04 22:00:00;1 minute;Bright red/orange fireball spotted in southeast sky My husband and I were on our deck watching fireworks.  A bright object no where near the fireworks display caught my eye.   I told him to turn to his left and look up.  It was a bright red/orange fireball.  It moved vertically, very slow.  My husband thought maybe it was a meteor, but it was too big to be that.   After traveling in a fairly straight line, it just disappeared.   Others must have seen this strange object also, as many people would have their eyes to the sky tonight!;43.2138000000001;-77.4575000000001
