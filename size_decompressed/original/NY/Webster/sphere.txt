Yellow/Orangish Balls streaking across the sky, no sound from them at all, and no tail.;2013-10-01 19:20:00;30 minutes;Yellow/Orangish Balls streaking across the sky, no sound from them at all, and no tail. Went out to grill shortly after dark, and to my amazement saw about 10-15 orange-red balls floating across the sky.  No sound at all, moving from SW to NE. Just a constant stream of these balls moving in the same direction and same speed, if I had to guess, probably a little faster than an airplane. 500-600 mph??   There was zero wind tonight too. They were flying low it looked like, maybe 5,000 feet. I would say 100-200 of these objects flew across the sky over a half hour time frame.  Also when they were flying over dogs were barking, which is out of the ordinary for my neighborhood at night. Also heard many owls and birds too. Me and my GF were freaked out!!;43.2138000000001;-77.4575000000001
