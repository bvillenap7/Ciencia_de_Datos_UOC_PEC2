Dancing lights in the night sky over Webster, NY.;2004-06-24 21:50:00;5 to 10 min;Dancing lights in the night sky over Webster, NY. My wife was on her way home from her mother's when she noticed several shapes inthe sky above the clouds. They appeared to her like angels or ghosts in the sky, but they were not. She noticed them for about 5 to 10 minutes. They seemed to be zig zaging and figure eighting around in the sky. Strangely enough there was a wind storm passing by at the same time. The lights were just white. My wife and I are Nurses by trade. My wife Heidi is a very concrete thinker and hates anything sci-fi. So when she told me about what she saw, she beleived them to only be helicopters. She asked if I had seen them. I did not see the lights or hear any noises loud enough to be a helicopter. According to my wife there was no special features or haze or beams emmitting from the lights. They were just lights to her. I asked if the lights looked like they were comming from the ground. She said no. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));43.2138000000001;-77.4575000000001

2 glowing and flashing orange lights over Lake Ontario!;2018-03-22 22:00:00;30 minutes;2 glowing and flashing orange lights over Lake Ontario! 2 flashing lights seen directly over Lake Ontario about 500ft from shoreline.  Started with one bright flashing orange light, too low to be a plane and was completely silent and too high to be a boat.   Caught 5 min of footage halfway through another light appeared next to the first one for a bit, then shut off like a light switch.  The lights came on/off for over 30min in different formations.   I live directly on Lake Ontario and have seen these lights before!  A craft foreign to the waters thatâ€™s all I know for certain!!!;43.2138000000001;-77.4575000000001
