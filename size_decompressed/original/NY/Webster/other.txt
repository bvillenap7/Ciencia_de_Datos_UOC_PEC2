UFO with big bright light headed toward us.;2015-06-18 22:00:00;1 minute;UFO with big bright light headed toward us. Sitting outside at a small neighborhood pier, my friend and I spotted a flying object in the sky that was flying remarkably low.   At first it was very far away, and it looked like it could be a small plane, but it was moving pretty fast.  Shortly after we mentioned how low it was flying, and how quickly it was moving.  It turned directly toward us.  It mostly just looked like a large ray of light and its speed picked up even faster.   At that point we started to run.  I looked back as we were running to see where it was in the sky, and the object appeared to be dome-shaped with some formational lights located under the main light source – my friend says she saw 4 lights in particular – and it was extremely close to us not shining any beams but simply progressing in our direction.   We ran until it was out of sight, and it seemed to have just disappeared into the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
