It seemed to be a boomerang or triangular shape object that was hovering, but slowly moving   at first I thought it was a plane until we followed it up the street for 1 minute and it just vanished.  The sky was completely clear there was no clouds.  None of us understand where it went.  I went home after and I wanted to tell someone about it but I know no one would believe me and I thought this would be my only hope of anyone acknowledging what me and my 2 friends have seen.;41.5976999999999;-73.8895000000002
