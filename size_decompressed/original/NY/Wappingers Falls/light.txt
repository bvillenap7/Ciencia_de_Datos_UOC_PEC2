about 30 points of light traveling in a rope like formation that was whipping back around itself;2009-12-10 21:25:00;20 seconds;about 30 points of light traveling in a rope like formation that was whipping back around itself As of 20 minutes ago ( 12/10/09 at 9:25 pm) I stepped outside my home in Wappingers Falls and looked up and saw how beautiful  the stars are and how  clear the sky was due to the cold temperature.   Traveling southeast I saw a string of orange lights.  They were very tiny to the eye. Almost the size of a very distant star.  At first it looked like formation of Canadian geese because it was traveling in a V formation.  But then very quickly and erratically changed their orientation.  They were then like a loose rope, or like a whip, still all in a line but following each other like a snake.  They traveled a great distance in only about 10 seconds.  1st almost over head and then out of sight.   It all happened very quickly but would estimate there were about 25 to 30 of them.   I know that this was not something natural or man made.;41.5976999999999;-73.8895000000002

Bright White Light Hovering Low in the sky.;2016-10-04 21:26:00;3 minutes;Bright White Light Hovering Low in the sky. Pulled into my driveway with my husband.  There was an extremely bright round light low in the sky behind my neighbors house.  There was no sound and it seemed not to move. Watched it for a few minutes and then went inside to an upstairs window.  There was a red/white/green light that seemed to be in a straight line.  Lights moved and it stayed low but then it sounded like a plane.  I could see a bright white light as it moved away.  There was no sound prior to seeing the colored lights.  I snapped a photo.;41.5976999999999;-73.8895000000002
