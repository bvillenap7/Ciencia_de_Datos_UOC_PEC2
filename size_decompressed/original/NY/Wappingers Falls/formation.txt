1st of 2;1985-09-01 21:00:00;unsure;1st of 2 It ws a Friday night and we had just returned from getting pizza, at Pizza Village.  My parents, brother and I all witnessed 5-7 lights in the sky in the direction of Stewart AFB.  The lights made no noise except when directly overhead, then it was a waa, waa kind of sound.  Mother said that my stepfather and I went into the backyard and disappeared?  We were supposedly less than 20ft from her and my brother.  I have no recollection of an end to this sighting.  Simply meaning I don't remember ever going in the house.  The next day the Poughkipsee journal reported stunt pilots flying manuevers? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
