It must have been about 40 feet above me and was completely silent and was floating slowly (not moving quickly). It stayed for a few seconds and when i passed it i looked back but then looked forward to drive (so i didn't see where or how it went). I do know that it wasn't in the area when i drove back that way about ten minutes later. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
