Red Green and Blue pulsating object circling in a clockwise direction moving East to West;2010-07-31 22:10:00;30 seconds;Red Green and Blue pulsating object circling in a clockwise direction moving East to West At approximately 22:10 on July 31, 2010, I walked outside of my apartment and something caught my eye in the sky.   When I looked up, I saw 3 lights, red, green and blue in a triangle formation rotating in a clockwise direction.  The lights were pulsating/blinking very fast.  The object was moving from East to West towards the Tappan Zee Bridge.  At first I thought it was an airplane, but I very quickly realized that this was something like I have never seen before.  It moved at the same speed as a plane but I could not hear any noise.  After about 30 seconds, I lost sight of it behind the trees, but appeared to be heading towards the Hudson River.  When I first saw it, I was facing North- North - East, and it was at about a 60 degree angle.  The lights were larger than those on airplanes.  I would imagine that someone on the Tappan Zee or I-287 would have seen it since I live so close to the highway.;41.0841;-73.8397
