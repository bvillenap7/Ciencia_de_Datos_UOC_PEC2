Ufo seen over Tappan Z Bridge Westchester County NY;2011-09-28 09:52:00;3 minutes;Ufo seen over Tappan Z Bridge Westchester County NY Me and a friend were talking and standing outside enjoying the evening and all of a sudden I noticed lights approaching the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River.  We were about a few hundred yards away when we saw the object appearing to be a dark  triangular object with very bright lights on each of the 3 corners. I took 2 pictures and couldnt photograph anymore with my ht evo 8 mega pix because i ran out of card space.  My boyfriend and I have seen several ufos over the years in NY especially over Westchester County in the form of triangles, orbs and other unknown shapes.;41.0841;-73.8397
