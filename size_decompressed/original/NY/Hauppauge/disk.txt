Strange hovering manuvuers of object over Long Island;1999-11-05 03:10:00;20min;Strange hovering manuvuers of object over Long Island At 3:10 am I witnessed what appeared to be an object brighter than a star. This did not appear to be a plane or helicopter due to the erratics manuvuers it was making. It stayed in the same area, approximately 10,000 feet high over the south shore of Long Island. It had an up and down, side to side and even a diagonal motion to it. Periodically there were faint blue flashes emitting around it. It was a diamond to saucer type shape. I tried to look at it through binoculars but could not focus. After about 15 minutes, it slowly moved southwest unitl it disappeared from my view over the tree line.;40.8225;-73.2035
