Bright orange fireball flying westward over long island;2012-08-25 21:45:00;1 minute;bright orange fireball flying westward over long island Bright round orange fireball sighted flying east to west, low flying, then gained height after it passed, high in the sky.  Seemed slower than a plane.  Did not make a sound, headed towards a star in the west and vanished.  Did try to record it with my phone camera, but it did not appear on the video, which was odd.  It was very odd looking.  It was shades of orange, darker, medium and lighter.;40.8225;-73.2035
