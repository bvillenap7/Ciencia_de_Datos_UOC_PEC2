Round, circular light moving very quickly;2009-12-11 05:50:00;east;Round, circular light moving very quickly On Thursday, December 11, 2009, at 5:50am, I was traveling on Rte 347 heading to work when I spotted a bright, white circular light traveling 3-4,000mph and about 3-5,000 ft above the ground.  I only saw it for a sec and a half.  Iâ€™ve been in the aviation business, working with aircraft and I have never seen anything travel that fast.  It looked like it was traveling from the north shore to the south shore of Long Island.  I have been following UFO stories for years and have been looking up at the sky for many years and I have never seen anything like this.  I know what I saw was real.;40.8225;-73.2035
