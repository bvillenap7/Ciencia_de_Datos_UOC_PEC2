The sky was clear and I happened to glance up to look at the stars when I noticed one particular star twinkled a little too bright.  Then I realized it started moving!  It was too high up to be a plane or any other object we know of and made no sound.  The light pulsed brightly every 5-8 seconds and was moving in a strange pattern,almost like a zigzag motion.  The object easily camouflaged within the stars.  After a it seemed like it completed a circle in the sky it start ascending higher until it was no longer in sight.;41.2846;-73.8904000000001
