three crafts viewed appearing and reappearing at a rapid pace;2003-09-09 21:00:00;10 MINUTES;three crafts viewed appearing and reappearing at a rapid pace My husband and I witnessed an extremely bright light sw of our home on the horizon.  As we watched it vanished...reappearing horizontally several miles from origin almost instantly.  It then disappeared and reappeared with another back at original location.  As quickly as it they both appeared they vanished reappearing only seconds later with yet another in a triangle shape...they hovered and seem to circle each other than vanished.This following the events of the prior night, when my son was woken by a bright light in his window.  When he peered into the brightly moon lit sky he distinctly saw a triagle shaped craft with red, white and blue lights that changed to red, yellow, and green.  The craft fluxuated back and forth coming closer and nearly disappearing from sight.  The craft shift rapedly then vanished.;44.8447;-74.955
