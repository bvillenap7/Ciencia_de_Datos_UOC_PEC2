He was looking for satellites going by when he spotted a strange line and told me to look directly up.  I saw it too, it was somewhat faint, slow moving streak in the sky.  It came seemingly out of know where.  Thought maybe it was a comet at first, but he said he saw individual lights in a line, I couldn't see as well because of the smoke from the fire.  We both then saw a second line, both heading north, but at slightly different angles.  They disapered behind trees shortly after.  No sound that we where aware of.;43.0642;-74.3340000000003
