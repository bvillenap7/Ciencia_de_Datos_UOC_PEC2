No sound or pulsating.  I am a frequent sky watcher, and knew as soon as I laid eyes on it that it was not a plane because it was not on one of the local plane paths.   The light was intense and much different than other common earthy vehicles.   I did video tape my experience.;43.0642;-74.3340000000003

Right away I was in question as there is no cross section of road.   The bright light slowly approaching the roadside leaving me to think mabey a dirt bike with very bright headlamp was going to pull out in front of me so I eased on the breaks.   At this point the light crossed in front of me but it was unusually high for any type of land vehicle as it traveled toward me, just to my left side, as if it was oncoming traffic.   When the light was directly beside me it shot off behind me extremely fast and disappeared.;43.0642;-74.3340000000003
