There were only a few clouds off in the distant and the air temperature was 35 degrees. I was looking for a vapor trail as there was none. Also, a small flock of seagulls circled the same surrounding area as to where the object appeared. There were no other sounds such as school buses as today is a holiday for local schools. The object seemed much smaller than most jets I’ve seen flying at such a high altitude. The sun hadn’t come up at this point so the sky was clear and somewhat grayish in color. I alerted my girlfriend and she needed extra time to get a fix on it and finally saw it. I asked her to bring out my 36 power telescope and I got to see it as hazy in color yet silver. It at times looked as if it was a double disc like figure. The sound stopped and so did the object. It  remained their for approx. 15min. I called our county sheriff dept. and mentioned the event, he said he would send a local patrolman to check it out  and that he would contact the FAA about the sighting. The local police came onto my property and up on my porch and I pointed towards the direction of it, and he too spotted the object. He used my telescope to get a better fix on it, and said he had no idea as to what it was. He finally after 5minutes or so left at which point the object seemed to be going higher without any audible sound.;43.0642;-74.3340000000003
