Three constant bright white lights one blinking red.  The white lights made a triangular formation if you connected the dots.. the &quotlead&quot constant white light had a slow blinking red one right next to it (looking up at it I think the red one was at the right of the constant white lead one) it was traveling from the South ..  Moving slow not stopping as far as I could tell. I went outside it was a quiet sound  could almost make out a the figure of the body as dark maybe black, chevron in shape as it passed over our house ?? No other light colors anywhere on shape.  It was not a plane. It was a definite figure of a craft as lights were spaced just so. It got my attention cause the light coming towards from the window was bright at first I thought thats odd, kept looking and then thats not a plane and then planes dont have constant white lights with one blinking red, never saw that before is why it peaked my curiosity? then..  Im going to go outside an! d check it out.  Someone else told me they saw it too probably within a minute or two after me go over their house .. I believe We are on a flight path as I have seen in the summer time all on the same day.. big cargo planes traveling back and forth atleast 3-4 times during day light.So maybe something was flying possibly to Griffis AirForce base in Rome, NY ????  All I know is Im still thinking about what it was.  I wish I had thought to grab my camcorder.. but didnt.  I dont necessarily think UFO but wondered if there is any aircraft like this but makes me wonder.;43.061;-75.3874
