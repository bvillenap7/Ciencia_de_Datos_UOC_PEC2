Three bright dancing lights, seeming to attract and repel while staying close to one another.;2019-02-16 00:30:00;at least one hour;Three bright dancing lights, seeming to attract and repel while staying close to one another. Looked out window before going to bed to see three lights high in the sky southwest of my location.  They seemed to be dancing...almost like magnets, attracting and repelling one another in what seemed from my vantage point to be close proximity to one another.  I watched, left the window then came back 30 minutes later to see they had moved left of where I had originally seen them.  They were still doing the dance.  I did not stay up to see how long they stayed there.;43.061;-75.3874
