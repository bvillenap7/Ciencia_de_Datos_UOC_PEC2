My partner and I were outside our home in Friends Lake when we noticed a large bright white light in the distance that appeared to be a star. However, we noticed it was moving closer to us in the NE direction. There were no flashing lights, as would be expected to be seen on a plane. There was also no sound, as we usually would hear when a plane was passing over. It was a very clear night- to the point that we could clearly see the Milky Way. After traveling for approximately 3 minutes, the light made a 90  degree turn and headed SE.  It appeared to disappear for about 15 seconds as it crossed through the Milky Way- which didn’t seem like much time to go such a distance. The light reappeared on the other side of the Milky Way- and appeared to “pop back out” at a higher rate of speed and then slowing to the previous pace. The light/object continued SE for about 30 seconds and then appeared to move straight up until it could no longer be seen. Had we both not seen the same thing- we would have thought we imagined the whole thing.;43.648;-73.8054
