Did anyone else notice it? there were these perfect circles zipping around on the radar summary of the 11 o'colck news reports from Albany, New York which i have never seen before. They were flying around the north central part of Pennsylvania and they must have been huge, like the Mothership or something. I think they were traveling quite fast and they must have wanted to be witnessed by someone who might suspect what they were. One hovered on the sreen long enough to make me notice and the others moved quickly off of the screen. They could not have been storms. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
