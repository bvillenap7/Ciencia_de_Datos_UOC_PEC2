Reddish/orange spheres seen over NY southern Tier 8/24/13;2013-08-24 20:00:00;3 minutes;Redish/orange spheres seen over NY southern Tier 8/24/13 Walked outside looked up to western sky saw two bright red light.  About 5 times the size of the largest start in the sky.  Clear skies.  No blinking , no sound.  No fast movements.  Just kind of floated away into the western sky and disappeared within a matter of a few seconds.  Then turned to the north sky and saw another.  This one came very close and seemed to be only a few hundred feet in the sky.  This one then moved to the western sky and floated away in the same area as the other two.  Have some video of the third one going into space and disappearing.;42.1100828787882;-76.8643003030311
