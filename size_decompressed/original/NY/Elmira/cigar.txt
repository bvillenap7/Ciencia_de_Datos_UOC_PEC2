Tic-Tac shaped, wingless and no propulsion in the evening.;2021-07-21 21:00:00;40 minutes;Tic-Tac shaped, wingless and no propulsion in the evening. Saw the same UFO again, this time 2 weeks apart, roughly. It was located in the same location above neighborhoods in downtown Elmira. It had been silent and in the air for over 40 minutes. Tic-Tac, cigar-shaped. Several lights I could make out, mostly red. The craft appeared to be stationary for the duration of the 40 minutes until it disappeared out of my line of sight. No propulsion, completely silent. The most bizarre was seeing it in the same location as last time I witnessed it a few weeks prior. Definitely not a helicopter or a plane, especially having seen so many in the Big Flats Airport region. I don't believe it was a drone, also due to the fact that in the last five to ten minutes, it seemed like it was moving side-to-side. Wingless,no propulsion and silent from what I gathered. Second time I've seen it over the Elmira neighborhoods in July. The most striking was the changing of lights, almost like a star, but it wasn't high enough to be considere! d one. Interesting nonetheless.;42.1100828787882;-76.8643003030311
