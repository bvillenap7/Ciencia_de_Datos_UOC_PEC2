Orange light formation flies over Elmira, New York.;2014-11-15 20:20:00;1.5 minutes;Orange light formation flies over Elmira New York Formation of 20 Orange lights, chevron in shape - could have easily been one craft as all 20 lights moved in unison.   I have never seen this in person, until now - but looked exactly like the video of the Phoenix lights!   Watched for about 60 seconds before running inside to get my wife - by the time we got back outside the lights had traveled over half the town and quickly began turning off lowest light than in perfect sync all lights until only lead light was visible.  Lead light continued traveling for about 30 secs before fading quickly.   Not sure if there are any airforce bases in the area, as it could have been described as flares - but in my six months of living here I've never seen any airforce activity and it would have been dropping hot flares right into the city neighborhoods - and I cannot imagine them doing this.   Furthermore, the perfect sync of the lights seemed unlikely for a flare drop.   Absolutely amazing to see.;42.1100828787882;-76.8643003030311
