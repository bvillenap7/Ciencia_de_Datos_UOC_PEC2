((anonymous report));2014-03-16 19:00:00;45 minutes;Sitting on my back porch, myself and four other individuals witnessed what appeared to be a moving star.  We quickly dismissed it as a satellite.  However, with the use of an iPhone application we were able to see that there were no satellites directly above us.   Then we witnessed the UFO change direction, multiple times, multiple directions, as well as remain stationary. We watched this occur for the duration of 45 minutes to an hour.   Considering the altitude of the object and its velocity, we concluded that it was a space ship.;42.1100828787882;-76.8643003030311
