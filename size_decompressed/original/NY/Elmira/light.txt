We decided to walk down near the Chemung river to get a better view.  We were next to the river at 1:00 AM.  It was a light that would change color from a very bright white light and would change to a red/white and orange/white to blue/white and moved in a counter clockwise circle.  The lights were on for one second and off for one second and would move in the circle at odd intervals.  However, a pattern did seem to exist.  It slowly moved upward.  Since it was getting cold, we decided to walk back home.  By the time we got back home about twenty minutes later, the light was gone.
