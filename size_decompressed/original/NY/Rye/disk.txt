On New Year's Day 1997 my ex-wife and her children went to Playland Park in Rye, N.Y. located on Long Island Sound.  The park was closed for the season, we simply went to walk the boardwalk and beach.  I took a photo of my step-children.  At the time I did not notice anything, but when the photos were developed I saw a strange, silver, hat-like object over the trees in the distance.  I have looked at this photo hundreds of times, even under a microscope, and I do not believe it is a bird, plane, balloon, or any other object. I have shown others, and they agree.  I lost this photo for years, and just recently found it, thought I would share it with you.  The second photo is simply a crop to get a closeup. I used my Iphone to simply take a photo of the original, but they came out pretty clear.  I lost the negatives long ago, but this was not due to a defect in the negative, I studied it carefully.  Anyway, I hope you find this photo interesting.;40.9755;-73.6909
