Bath, NY UFO Sighting;2009-10-25 07:07:00;8 seconds;Bath, NY UFO Sighting My wife, two children and I traveled through the southern tier of New York on Route 17/86 West on Sunday, October 25, 2009 – it was partly cloudy and just started to change from dark to light (it was more dark than light at this point - prior to sunrise).  We were heading home from a weekend visit with relatives.  The kids were sleeping – the radio was on very low, and I was driving.  My wife was seated on front passenger seat of our van.   As we traveled on the highway through Bath, NY, at exactly 7:07 a.m., my wife and I observed an extremely bright light / object in the top right corner of the front window of our van – it immediately caught our attention due to the brightness of the light / object – the object was traveling southwest at a 45 degree angle towards the ground – approximately 3 to 5 thousand feet off the ground – the object was moving fast…we were unable to make out the shape of the object – the object emitted a tail of light behind it, due to! how fast it moved. At first we thought it was a shooting star, but it was moving too slow for that - but too fast for a plane. We thought the light/object was going to impact the ground - we were a little scared at that point.  The light/object then changed its course and traveled parallel to the ground – the light/object turned up the speed dramatically, began traveling in a 45 degree angle upward as it disappeared over a mountain range.  The sighting lasted approximately 8 seconds. We didn’t see the object again.;42.3414;-77.3049
