Lights over Bath, NY;2012-01-23 07:50:00;15 minutes;Lights over Bath, NY While traveling North on 390 my husband and I noticed a strange light over Bath.  It blinked pretty steady and each blink would show a different amount. It would blink and we would see three lights usually close together and usually in a line. The next blink would show one or two, every blink was different and bright. At one point I saw them blink in a square formation, with four lights as the corners. my husband and I saw two of them 'race' for a moment.  That was when we knew they were not a typical aircraft or just lights in the sky.  This blinking went on for several moments and at times we could see what looked like high beams stretching out in front of them but the light would just stop like there was a wall but this all clearly happened in the clouds over the hills.  The clouds were low and unusually thick looking. We had to pull over and watch them.  My mother and a niece pulled over and got out of their vehicle to watch them too.  This went on for fiftee! n to twenty minutes but we needed to get home so we lost sight of them.;42.3414;-77.3049
