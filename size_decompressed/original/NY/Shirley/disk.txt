Appeared in Southwestern sky, arched almost across my zenith and faded out in the Notheastern sky. I've found reports of the same ufo after I sighted it:http://home.fuse.net/task/TWA-800.html It had 4 white lights from the side I could see, the were flashing in pattern. When I checked through my binoculars, I could barely make out the lines of the craft, which appeared to be a disk. I watched for maybe a minute as it made it's way higher, going almost directly over our house, then switched windows and continued to watch. My mom was nearby, I called her over and she aggreed the light pattern was like none she'd ever seen (we get a lot of overhead traffic. Helicopters and such). We lost sight of it behind the treetops.;40.8018;-72.8675
