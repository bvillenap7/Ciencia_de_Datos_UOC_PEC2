MY WIFE AND I WERE IN OUR HOT TUB OUT IN OUR BACK YARD. WE HAVE A CLEAR VIEW OF THE SKY.  IT WAS AROUND 230 AM -245.AM THE SKY WAS JUST CLEARING FROM BEING CLOUDY GREY LOOKING CLOUDS.WE WERE LOOKING UP TOWARD THE SKY AN OBJECT MOVING VERY VERY SLOW WAS MOVING SOUTH TO NORTH OVER THE WILLIAM FLOYD PKWAY AREA.IT WAS OVAL WITH RED LIGHTS ALL AROUND IT. IN THE FRONT THERE WAS A BRIGHT BEAM OF LIGHT JUST CUTTING THROUGH THE CLOUDS. SO BRIGHT THAT THERE IS NO WAY THIS WAS A PLANE OR HELICOPTER!ALSO IT WAS QUIET! NO NOISE. I LIVE NEAR A SMALL AIROPRT ABOUT A COUPLE OF MILES AWAY AND YOU WOULD HEAR ALL THE PLANES IN THE SKY.THERE WAS NO OTHER OBJECTS IN THE SKY EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE. IT WAS SO BRIGHT THAT IT WAS NO WAY ONE OF OUR AIRCRAFT. OUR PLANES OR AIRCRAFT WOULD BE LOUD' AND THE LIGHTS WERE LIKE SO BRIGHT CRISP AND CLEAR!!THE OBJECT MOVED SO SLOW NO PLANE COULD DO THIS WITH OUT STALLING!IT MOVED THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND WAS CUTTING THROUGH THE DENSE CLOUDS LIKE A KNIFE THROUGH BUTTER. IT WENT BEHIND THE TREES AND THEN GONE!!NO NOISE OR LIGHTS !JUST LIKE VANISHED!!WE WERE BOTH CONVINCED THAT THIS WAS A UFO. IM A FIRM BELIEVER IN UFO'S AND I DO ALOT OF STUDYING UP ON THE SUBJECT IN MY SPARE TIME.AND WE BOTH KNOW WHAT WE SAW A BRIGHT BRIGHT UFO!WHO EVER IS A SKEPTIC ABOUT UFO'S BETTER GET A GRIP ON REALITY! WE ARE NOT ALONE!!;40.8018;-72.8675
