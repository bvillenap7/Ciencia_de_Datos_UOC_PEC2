I assume they were satellites, but I'd like to confirm as I’ve never seen anything like this before. This was in Shirley, N.Y.  I’d just stepped out front of my house for a smoke when they appeared.  It’s an overcast, rainy evening with no stars visible.   They appeared at about 45* and traveled to about 120* before disappearing, one then the other.  They seemed to be very high and I think they went out of view due to the height they reached rather than going behind clouds as their light burned through the cloud cover, or having burned up in the atmosphere. I brought my wife out to see them, and I recorded them.;40.8018;-72.8675
