I saw a v-shape craft flying south over head with unusual sounding jet engine roar.  It was flying slowing from north to south. It showed 3 white light on its under belly, one on each wing tip and one dead center on the body in line with the wings lights.   The engines then went silent and then craft banked right (west) and appeared to be flying north again then disappeared.    What I saw next were 2 or 3 small red and green lighted objects swirling in the area where the main craft turned west. I live near the Shirley, NY, airport (which doesn't allow jets) and have seen all types of air craft here, but nothing that sounded like these engine.;40.8018;-72.8675
