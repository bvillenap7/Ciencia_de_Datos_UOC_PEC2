Giant bright green circle.;2017-12-02 03:20:00;3 seconds;Giant bright green circle. Driving home, I very clearly saw a huge, BRIGHT green circle fly through the sky at a high rate and promptly disappear in the distance.  It lit up the sky in its vicinity with a very bright green color, very distinguishable from comets or shooting stars. the circle was about half the size of a full moon.  I saw it very clearly for about 3 seconds.;42.9709;-77.5821
