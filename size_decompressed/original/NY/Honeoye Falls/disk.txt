The object was about 1/2 mile away from me at near treetop level. The area in question is mostly residential with schools in the area. I watched this object for about 2 minutes. It was not any kind of aircraft I am familiar with. It moved little but eventially disappeared. The other cashier was busy with customers and was not able to view it. It would have been dangerously low if it were and aircraft. I estimate it was substantially larger than a small plane. I tried later to interview residents of the area and none saw anything. I also reconnoitered the area to look for anything unusual that might explain the sighting. Nothing was found. No other people said they saw it.;42.9709;-77.5821
