Lights flashing;2012-03-24 22:30:00;?;Lights flashing My husband and 14 year old son called me outside to see something interesting.  The night was dark with extensive cloud cover, some drizzling rain starting.   Up in the sky was a strange formation of lights that seemed to dance around and meet in the center and then rush and spin out from the center. I at first thought it might be searchlights of some type, but there were no beams emanating from the ground.  We have lived in this metropolitan area for over 27 years and I have never seen such a display.  It went on for at least a good twenty minutes, probably more, and two neighbors also saw it.;40.7072;-73.8271
