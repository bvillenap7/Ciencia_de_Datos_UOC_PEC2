UFO over Herkimer, NY.;2016-07-03 22:00:00;5 minutes;UFO over Herkimer, NY. My daughter and son was out in the front of our home with the dog and as I was walking from the back of the house to meet her she was telling me about a plane she was watching and asking me if it was a plane or not.  I looked up in the sky and saw a golden orange craft slowly flying in the sky, but to the northern part of the sky there was an actual plane flying and I showed her the difference between the two.  Then my husband was coming up the driveway to meet us and we showed him what we were watching.  Then only a min or two later 2-3 other crafts with the same color glow joined in after the first one stopped and the lights dimmed to look as if it was a faint star off in the distance.   My cell phone is broken and was unable to capture anything but below is basically the shape I remember it forming in the sky before each craftâ€™s lights faded to a very dim light.  You would have to have been watching the entire time to see they were still there or would think! was a star in the distance.   The dog was starting to whine for a min or so while we were watching and then we all headed inside kinda freaked out.;43.0333;-74.9812000000001
