H shaped object, green mist all around it, Upstate NY ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.  PD));2004-08-31 20:00:00;30 to 40 minutes;H shaped object, green mist all around it, Upstate NY I was going with my girlfriend to get a late night car wash and I looked up into the clear sky to see the weirdest sight I've ever seen. In the shape of an H, way in the sky an enormous green mist in the shape of the letter H, I have never seen anything like it before, it was very high up in the sky and very large space it took up.My girlfriend was very nervous and I ran inside to get her mother and brother and show them, we looked in the sky for quite a while and observed the event, we were all in astonishment and in awe. We live in central New York, so it's not like our eyes were playing a trick on us like the Northern lights or something. I just hope more people saw this it was truly strange.

Multicoloured unknown shaped aircraft;2012-07-03 21:11:00;about a minutue and a hal;multicoloured unknown shaped aircraft Hello I'm using a Motorola xoom tablet and on 7/3/12 at approximately 21:11   I was taking somes night pictures of some cool looking clouds and I seen a weird looking aircraft floating in the air over some trees as I was taking the picture out of my apartment window.  It looks like a saucer, but when you zoom in the aircraft looks multicolored like gems.  I'm not too sure on the shape, but it kinda looks like the same one at the bottom on this site  http://www.ufocasebook.com/bestufopictures15.htm Except mine is a better picture.;43.0333;-74.9812000000001
