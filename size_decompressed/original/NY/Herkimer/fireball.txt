I looked up at a low horizon star constellation as i have been daily.  A orange fireball flew by the stars slowly.  I could not tell it's distance, but i believe it was quite far away.   The event took place West of my location (of Herkimer). I watched it for maybe 15-20 seconds and seen a flash.  Nothing further to report.;43.0333;-74.9812000000001
