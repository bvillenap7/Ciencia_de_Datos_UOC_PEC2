Star watching when we saw a very bright large obj. moving in very fast movements unlike any a/c. Up down and L to R.  ((Venus??));2015-04-18 23:45:00;5 minutes;We were star watching when we saw a very bright large object moving in very fast movements unlike any airplane.   Up down and left to right.  It would stay in one spot for a bit then move fast in a different direction.   It was very bright and a lot bigger than an airplane.   I have never seen anything like this.  It left very fast in one direction. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Venus.  PD);43.0333;-74.9812000000001
