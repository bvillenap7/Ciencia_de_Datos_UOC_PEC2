So, I flicked my vehicle lights at the object , it immediately & quickly changed its direction and came right toward my vehicle , at which time I immediately pulled over, watched the cigar shaped unit slowly hover just a little above the treetops just slightly north of where we stopped, as if it were looking down & checking us out .  I was out of the vehicle & I remember what was like 4 spotlights , 1 front, 1 on the back & 2 off the side.  It hovered for a short while & then slowly glided east parallel to the road we were on & then crossed over the highway south & dropped westward down into the Mohawk Valley.  I remember at least 2 other cars being stopped, however I  never spoke w/ anyone, nor did I ever report incident.  The weirdest thing was there was no sound emitting from this  aircraft !!     Incident occurred east of the village of Herkimer , N.Y. on State Hwy 5, approximately  ½ mile east of the East Herkimer community and slightly east of what is known as Little Falls St. Mary’s cemetary.
