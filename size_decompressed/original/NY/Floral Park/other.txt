Drone-ish type thing.;2015-06-28 19:20:00;10 minutes;Droneish type thing Upon entering my backyard after going shopping, my wife and I spotted this object floating low in the sky.  To me it looked like a seahorse/drone-ish looking type thing, it was black.  It's really hard to describe it.   I have pictures and video to back up what we saw.   The object first went north then headed east as it slowly climbed into the sky.  I followed it using binoculars as it floated off to the east until I couldn't see it anymore.  It also appeared to change shapes.   At first I considered it to be balloons, but even upon looking at the pictures the object doesn't look like a balloon at all.   Made no noise.   I'm puzzled.;40.7235000000001;-73.7021000000001
