About 12 orange fireballs seen moving in an eastward flight pattern in Ontario, NY, on Saturday, June 15th, around 10:30 pm.;2013-06-15 22:30:00;5 minutes;About 12 orange fireballs seen moving in an eastward flight pattern in Ontario, NY, on Saturday, June 15th, around 10:30 pm. One elementary school teacher and one  computer programmer were driving on County Line Road in Ontario, NY, off of Lake Road. We saw orange balls of light in the sky, moving swiftly eastward.  There were about five at first, then some in pairs and some alone, all on the same flight pattern.  We pulled over to the side of the road to watch.I took a movie of them on my iPhone.  A car with a man and a woman pulled up alongside ours and the woman asked if we knew what those things were-we said we did not. (It should be noted that about three years agoe we did see two orange fireballs in Brighton, NY (in Rochester) on Monroe Avenue, that looked exactly like these, except they moved in an elliptical pattern around each other.  These ufos moved in a straight line at a steady, consistent pace. We tried to follow the last one but they disappeared.;43.2314;-77.309
