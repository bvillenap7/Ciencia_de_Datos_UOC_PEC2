((Sirius??);2012-02-27 00:00:00;2 hours;My neighbor texted me just after midnight telling me if I was up to look out my back window to the South and see if I saw a flashing light hovering, so when I looked I also saw it, it was there for quite awhile, I woke up my husband for him to look too, I kept checking for awhile and it was still there, the flashing light looked blueish to me. I went back to sleep a little after 1:00 and it was still there.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness probably was looking at a celestial body, probably a twinkling star.
