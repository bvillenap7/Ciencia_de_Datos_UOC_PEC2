ORANGE GLOWING OBJECT, HOVERING FIRST, THEN RAPIDLY ACCELERATING IN ONTARIO, NY;2011-07-01 21:45:00;3 mins;ORANGE GLOWING OBJECT, HOVERING FIRST, THEN RAPIDLY ACCELERATING IN ONTARIO, NY My wife and I were driving Eastbound on Rt.104 in the town of Ontario, New York, when we observed a bright Orange Oval Object moving towards us low to the horizon.   I originally thought that it might be street light.   When we got closer, it almost appreared to be a hot air balloon with orange flame type lighting the bottom.  We made a u-turn, and pulled off the road into a parking lot where we then observed the object as it hovered for about two minutes.   The light was orange with no other colored lights observed.  I estimate the altitude to be about 3-4 thousand feet.  It was silent as it hovered.   After about 2-mins, it took off at a hight rate of speed to the east.  As it was moving away, it began to flicker, and then blinked out. We did video the object on a Camera Phone, but all that we could pick up was a faint light.  You clearly see it move off rapidly i the video, but we could not zoom nearly close enough for a good look.   NOTE:  I am a pilot, and am very familiar with many types of aircraft.  I am also an Air Force Veteran.  This is like nothing I've ever observed in my years as a pilot.;43.2314;-77.309
