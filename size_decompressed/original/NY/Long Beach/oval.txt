An oval brilliantly bright/white object with a trailing tail moving east to west over the ocean in 3-4  seconds.;2008-08-03 22:00:00;3-4 seconds;An oval brilliantly bright/white object with a trailing tail moving east to west over the ocean in 3-4  seconds. The object was bright oval with a trailing tail behind it. The size is hard to determine but if I were to put 75-100 stars together, it might approximate the size if it.  It was heading across the sky from east to west at approximately 10:00pm last night, Sunday night. It arked slightly, seeming to hesitate, as if to drop into the ocean, but then as if restarting it zoomed across the night sky, with a tail of lesser light trailing behind it. It took about 3 seconds for the whole thing and I was sure that there were reports of it but when I called the police station, no one had mentioned anything.  It was not a shooting star.;40.5832;-73.6594
