((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I was waking from my house to Ralph's ices about 1/3 mile from my house with my 3 cousins on beech street when we stopped to look at 2 fixated lights hovering over the ocean.  They were horizontal and triangular, and appeared to me to be at least 1/8 over the oceanfront part of the  beech given my proximity.  They never moved. . 40 seconds from the time I decided to film it.  I snapped one shot across the street, and one  second before I confirmed what my first thought was. I was  perhaps 2 blocks from the ocean on beech st on and fumbled for video mode.  I was able to get the  .40 second shot before I saw a direct plane or such pale out or muffle my video.   The occurance of moment left us perplexed  discussing coincidence and chance ...  After the fact.  One of my troupe who is witness is an actuary and is perhaps the best possible person I would have as witness testify On behalf my/our claim.  ((END ADDENDUM));40.5832;-73.6594
