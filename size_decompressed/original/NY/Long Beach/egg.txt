After a brief walk along the beach my wife and I observed what we at first thought was a far off air craft. In an instant it came upon us. Hovering aproximately 100 yards from shore came an object about 50ft round, like a football, or an egg. No moving parts or visible interuptions were seen. It was almost like a light bulb . It stood motionless and made no sound. Right about the time that wee all started yelling for attention it flew away back the way it came. I did not report this to any officials knowing that I would get nothing more that some B-S story.;40.5832;-73.6594
