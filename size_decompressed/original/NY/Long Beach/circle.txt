Three what looked to be large stars traveling in an unnatural manner.;2001-04-14 22:30:00;3 min aprx;Three what looked to be large stars traveling in an unnatural manner. The time is approximate, my boyfriend looked up at the sky and said look! and pointed, as I looked I saw a large star, same color as a star, same brightness, but much bigger, it was still pretty far away.  It was traveling at a very even, smooth, speed, not fast, cruising, then my boyfriend said  look, there's two more! and pointed in the opposite direction, as I turned and looked, I saw two more, same as above, traveling next to each other but in a semi-circular path, the one on the right a little in front of the one on the left, it seemed to be following it.  The single one was headed southeast, and the two were headed northwest.  We were facing south over the Atlantic Ocean one block from the beach.  This is to the best of my knowledge as to direction they were headed.  But, discription is totally acurate.;40.5832;-73.6594
Two white circular lights chasing each other back and forth at fast speed.;2018-06-22 10:00:00;1-5 minutes;Two white circular lights chasing each other back and forth at fast speed. Last night at around 10pm I was laying in bed staring out the window with a view of the east end canal in Long Beach and saw two large white circular lights chasing each other back and forth at a quick speed.  They were hidden within the clouds but the shape and light color were easy to see.  The clouds seemed low last night because the orbs looked large.  Saw them 3 times in a matter of a minute before they went away.  Then about 5 minutes later just saw one traveling a bit slower and a bit farther away.;40.5832;-73.6594
