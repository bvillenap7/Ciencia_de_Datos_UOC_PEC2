Large red light seen crossing the moon in a few seconds.;1978-07-01 08:45:00;Only 4 or 5 seconds;Large red light seen crossing the moon in a few seconds. When I was about 8 or 9 years old my father was stationed at FT Drum New York.  My whole family seen it, so not just me.  It was a summer night and we where all outside on the patio relaxing.  Then... this thing had to be big, really big as it looked like a red dot that went across the moon.  It was not a Comet or an Asteroid as it had no tail and honestly moved to slow to be either of the two in my opinion. As a note the light was solid, it did not blink and was the color of a traffic light.  It was going the speed or looked the same way a plane looks crossing the sky. It appears slow but in fact is going 100's of miles an hour.  Now the fact it crossed the moon in about 4 seconds is very fast indeed. I can not even begin to speculate on the speed.  I made a small animation of what it looked like.  I have never seen anything else since then even though I looked constantly with my telescope and moon map I got that Christmas. I am now 34 years old. LOL!  Thanks  ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));44.0282000000001;-75.7533999999999
