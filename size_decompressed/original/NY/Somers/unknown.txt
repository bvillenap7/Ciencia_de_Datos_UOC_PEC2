At approximately 3:30 AM on 10/17/04, we first spotted a starlike object hovering in the sky and appearing to move horizontally and vertically (what looked to be a few inches at a time from our point of view)After observing this object for approximately 15 minutes or so, we spotted three others. Together, the four of them formed a diamond pattern. We watched for approx. 1 hour and then wnet to bed. All four objects remained in rhe sky by the time we retired at approx. 4:15 AM. The object at the top of the diamond from our vantage point displayed a red flashing light from time to time. It was a clear night. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible celestial bodies??  PD));41.3379;-73.6943
