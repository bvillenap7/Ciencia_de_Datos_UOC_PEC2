silvery circular object suspended high in the sky;2010-10-19 13:00:00;15 minutes;silvery circular object suspended high in the sky I noticed a shiny silvery object very high in the sky at about a north/east position.  At first I thought it was an air craft but then a plane flew by and the object was sitting still at a high altitude.  Motionless. I thought maybe a weather baloon or possably the suns reflection of a planet.  But then it just shot up in a flash?  thats it!;40.9350396475772;-73.8662678414097
