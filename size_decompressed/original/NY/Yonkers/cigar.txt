Straight Line of Lights disappears and reappears while zig zagging across the sky;2020-02-17 21:35:00;20 seconds;Straight Line of Lights disappears and reappears while zig zagging across the sky Don't get confused with the two airplanes in the middle.  Look up higher and to the left and you going to see a white line. It then disappears and then reappears. Then immediately it moves left and downward so fast it makes the two airplanes in the middle look like they are just sitting there.  Then at 9 seconds if you put the video in slow motion, you will see it the zigzagging so fast in slow mo, as if it's going supersonic speed and it seems to disappear while going left. If you look at the sky as I move the camera down to stop the video you can see it come back and drop down around 30k feet in a second;40.9350396475772;-73.8662678414097
