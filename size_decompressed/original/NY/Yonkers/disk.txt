I've seen these lights at all times, even until 5:45am EST before dawn and it has no sign of letting-up.  What I saw last night, 10 minutes into my walk was a brief orange ball, at the top of the hill I walk to over the house-line. Then nothing, I continue walking down a long slope once again under the tree-line...and then a sound that I don't remember exactly followed by a bright series of lights in a horizontal pattern, A UFO! I stop cold, and think about turning back, it dissappears after 5 seconds or so, and so I continue down the hill. For the rest of the time, I see two dark-red glowing craft (far below star-distance) following with me, and stopping with me whole way back to my street. One was always to the right of me, and another was also ahead on that side and also appeared on the left side of the road.  I was very amazed, but not scared because of the frequency of their appearence. I didn't run, because my nighttime walk is long, and they seemed to have me cornered, and knew my path. For the past 2 weeks I try never to walk along at night because I will always see them if I am alone. If someone is with me, they are not there, or are at a star-distance only.;40.9350396475772;-73.8662678414097
