A fast object in the night sky;1975-11-20 20:00:00;15 minutes;A fast object in the night sky It was during the Thanksgiving holiday. and it may have been on Thanksgiving evening.   I was looking south at the night sky (from an outdoor terrace)  and up and at least 10,000 feet in the air there was a light that travelled from point A to B in milliseconds and then stopped.  It travelled in jaggered, supersonic right angles and then stopped and then disappeared.  It then returned (moments later) in the western sky but lower around 2,000 feet and then stopped and didn't move, it then disappeared.  NOTE: Point A to Point B must have been at least 5 miles from each other, considered the height that the object was travelling.;40.9350396475772;-73.8662678414097
I was watching a star like object moving very slowly;1999-10-14 14:00:00;5 minutes;I was watching a star like object moving very slowly I was awaiting transpotation then I happened to look up in a very crisp clear blue sky I saw what look like a very small star but it was moving. It was not a bird,military craft, or any other airplane. I was watching it and then lost sight of it. This was a very strange craft I can usually say that it could be identified but this one was something very different.;40.9350396475772;-73.8662678414097

Moving light with no sound or blinking/pulsating.;2011-08-30 20:44:00;20 seconds;Moving light with no sound or blinking/pulsating. I was home and decided to look out my living room window like usual, and look at the night sky like i do every night. I looked out the window and glanced at the night sky before i started looking at stars and i saw a few stars and a very bright one, i glance at the other side of the sky then look back to the other side to realize the bright star moved from its position a bit so i started looking at it and i saw it was moving. I called my mom over to see it and she saw it as well. What i thought the object was a plane or a helicopter.  The object was as bright as a bright star but a little brighter.  I noticed it didnt have red/green lights or blinking lights like aircraft should have.  I know it wasnt an airplane because im very very interested in airplanes and kknow alot about them of how they look during the day and night and how they sound.  The object was moving in a straight direction (Moving from West to East). I opened the window to hear nothing coming from it.  Then i said in my head  UFO?  Alien life?  Government Test?. What i felt was anxiousness to know what it was that was just a moving light with no sound. What i did during the sighting was just stand at the window with my mom and watch it till i couldnt see it anymore because of my buildings shape. so the building got in my way to view it longer. After the sighting i went online to search if anyone else saw this before or even when i saw it. A tweet on twitter said there was a strange light in the sky tonight, not a star but not a helicopter, had no sound just slow moving ball of fire. Angle of elevation: 75-80 degrees above me Elevatio: About 400-500;40.9350396475772;-73.8662678414097
Bright pulsating white light on the horizon in the East;2013-03-29 23:30:00;5 minutes;Bright pulsating white light on the horizon in the East I was driving home near the Sprain Brook Parkway in New York and saw a bright white/yellow light in the sky that resembled a star.  The light started to rapidly descend towards the horizon line and then became stationary. I pulled over on the side of the road and started to record it with my phone camera.  The light started to slowly pulsate from bright to dim, this lasted for about 5 minutes.  The light then faded away completely and did not come back. The light was towards the East.;40.9350396475772;-73.8662678414097

Blue orb in sky over Yonkers, NY.;2015-10-24 19:00:00;30 seconds;Blue orb in sky over Yonkers I was driving north on Bronxville Road in Yonkers, NY 10708 heading in the direction of Kimball Ave.  As I passed the stop sign at Blair St I noticed a bright blue orb in the sky in front of the clouds and above the treeline as I pulled away.  I stopped and I pulled to the side before stop sign at Dewitt Ave and watched as the light suddenly shifted very fast down in the pattern of a Chevron and disappeared behind the treeline.  I witnessed about 45 seconds before I lost sight.  Was not a reflection of something like a spotlight or laser pointer and appeared to be generating the blue light.  Also moved and maneuvered like nothing man has ever made.;40.9350396475772;-73.8662678414097
