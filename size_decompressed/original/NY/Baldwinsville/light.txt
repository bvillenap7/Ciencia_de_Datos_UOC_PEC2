It was still not moving, I noticed it while closing my window I thought it was a star but it looked a little orange for a star,  I went outside with my dog to see better and it got bright twice and then faded back to its normal color at times it looked like it was blinking.

Then quickly came on a flashing red light in the middle of the 2 cyan ones.  It started to move faster when the red light came on and it quickly scooted away.
