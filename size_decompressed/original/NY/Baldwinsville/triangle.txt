Pointed  triangle across night sky, no sound or lights.;2012-04-20 23:30:00;6 seconds;Pointed  triangle across night sky,no sound or lights. Star gazing in back yard,saw dark pointed triangle,arrow head shaped, moving across the field of stars. I never would have seen it if it had not passed right through my field of vision! TOTALLY SILENT!  About the size of my fist when at arm's length,this was large enough that I should have heard something.  Tracked it for only about 6 seconds before it went beyond the roof of my house, I jumped up and went to end of house but could no longer locate it. It was like a black piece of paper moving across the sky with the shape revealed only by the stars.  This is a major metropolitan area,about 9 miles north of syracuse airport. It was traveling from east to west, no lights at all, seemed to be down where small planes are flying,very dangerous if this was some stealthy thing from our air force!  OR, it was much much higher and a lot bigger,witch could explain the no sound at all.  Star watching for 30 years,first time I don't know what it was.;43.1571000000001;-76.328
