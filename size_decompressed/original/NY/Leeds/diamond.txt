The object would hover, move left to right, right to left, and up and down. The object moved slowly through the sky, diamond shaped and bright. Colors could be faintly seen with the naked eye, but when the object was viewed through a high powered telescope it looked like watching fireworks. The object had multie color lighting comming off of it and was spinning. It looked faceted like a diamond.  Object seemed to move north west. Objects seem to appear after ten at night to about two in the morning.  Objects have been seen on every night in the past two weeks.
