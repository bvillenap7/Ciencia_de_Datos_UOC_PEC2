Low-flying triangular craft during snow storm;2001-11-01 21:00:00;15s;Low-flying triangular craft during snow storm I was taking out the garbage at night during a pretty heavy snow storm.  The dumpster is in a well-lit parking lot.  We lived in a building complex consisting of several houses in the middle of nowhere nestled alongside a large mountain-chain. As I'm returning back to my house, I catch a glimpse of a light to my right out of the corner of my eye.  I turn and I see a large triangular craft hover slowly overhead.  It was clearly visible in the flood-lights in the parking lot, though no detail could be seen through the snow.  It was no more than 20 feet above the tree line, and moved no more than 15MPH. After it passed overhead and started to head off into the darkness, I was able to gauge its height above the tree line.  I was also able to see a slight profile of the craft.  It seemed to be triangular in shape - more like a stretched out pyramid.  It could have been boomerang shape, I'm not entirely sure because of the snow, but I was able to see blue-white lights on its edges/corners shaped in a triangle fashion. The craft made no sound whatsoever. One thing I noticed is that my ears popped during the encounter.  That could have just been a coincidence as it is common at that elevation. My opinion is that the snow storm was too bad for any known aircraft to be flying that low. After this incident, I seem to be experiencing a phenomenon called street-light interference.
