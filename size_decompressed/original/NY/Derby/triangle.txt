I was at my parents' house, which is right on Lake Erie, South of the City of Buffalo.  Everyone in the house was sleeping and I was laying out on the pool deck, watching the stars because the sky was perfectly clear.  Then I see this thing come up very low over the trees and became quite stunned.  It was triangular in shape and metalic with a large, crimson globe in the center.  This light was on because I could see it reflecting on the sides of the craft, but it was very dim.  The craft silently flew over me at altitude of no more then a few hundred feet, and then arced around behind some more trees.  It had disappeared. While this had all been going on, I ran into the house to wake everyone up...no one would get up.  So, I came back outside and looked up and it hadn't disappeared yet.  I guess that convinced me that it was real. Over the years, I have searched the internet for triagle UFOs to see if I could find someone else that had seen it.  It may be interesting to note that I have found a few additional reports from Cleveland, OH (on the other side of the lake from Buffalo) and Pennsylvania (about 100 miles from Derby, NY, where my sighting had been).;42.6945;-78.9872
