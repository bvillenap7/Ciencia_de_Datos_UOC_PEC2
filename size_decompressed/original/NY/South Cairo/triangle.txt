As i watched the plane I noticed a glint of light coming from behind the plane.  At first I thought it might be another plane. I looked directly at the object and noticed it was a triangle shape, moving extremely fast. In a matter of 2 or 3 seconds it went from being about 1.5 miles behind the plane to 2 miles in front of the plane.  I could hear the sound of the planes engines as it went by my location. I heard nothing as the craft accelerated to pass the plane.  As I reached for my phone to take a picture this craft went vertical and accelerated to over 1000 miles per hour.  Both plane and craft were at about 10,000 feet when seen. As the craft went vertical it was out of my sight in a second.;42.264;-73.955
