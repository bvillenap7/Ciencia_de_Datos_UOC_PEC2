Bright light on the western ridge.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus is in the western sky at this time.  PD));2010-08-07 21:00:00;3 minutes;bright light on the western ridge Around 9 pm i was out on my porch, i was looking towards the west. i noticed a bright star like object just above the horizon.   At first i thought it was a planet, as i looked more at the object it was moving to the west following the ridge line. after a minute or two the object rolled over the ridge.   i climbed up on my roof to get a better view.  as i did i could still see the light from the object. i climbed down from the roof and looked back to the ridge when i saw the object come back to the east towards me.   as i watched for about a minute i went to climb back on the roof and the object rolled very fast back over the ridge and was out of sight.   I am no expert at astronomy but i have been looking at the stars my whole life and i have never seen a star go behind the horizon and then come back into view.  so i am quite sure what i saw was not any planet.
