Distant, Strange, Moving/Dancing/Fighting? Lights;1994-07-01 01:00:00;5-10 minutes;Distant, Strange, Moving/Dancing/Fighting? Lights I’m reporting this incident after looking through your past sightings and realizing that there is one that corresponds with the time and description of a sighting I had as a teenager. I’m fairly certain the year was 1994, I was 14 or 15. It was a summer night and my gut feeling is it was July. I was camping out with approx. 5 friends in a friend’s sheep pasture near his house. I would like to note that we were sober and there were no drugs involved. Two of them had snuck a couple of beers from the house and drank them but were not intoxicated. It was a perfectly clear night out and around midnight or 1am someone noticed the stars were moving. We all looked up and in increasing numbers there were lights zipping through the sky, at what appeared to be a distance outside of our atmosphere, they were small and the size of stars. As in the report I read on your site, our initial reaction was that it was a massive battle in space. The lights changed direction on a dime, curved and moved incredibly fast, changed color as well as disappeared and reappeared. Unlike the report on your site, I remember retaining the impression that this was some sort of battle and remember bursts of light similar to explosions and they were doing what appeared to be dog fighting. Growing up in a rural community I’ve spent many a night watching meteor showers and shooting stars and can vouch that this was neither of these things. The lights slowly disappeared similar to how they had started until it was completely gone. I believe the whole thing lasted 5-10 minutes maybe longer. The report I am referring to which is similar is:   Occurred : 7/1/1994 12:00 (Entered as : 07/01/94 12:00pm)  Reported: 5/13/2003 11:05:44 PM 23:05  Posted: 5/27/2003 Location: Ben Lomond, CA  Shape: Light Duration:45min ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Many different colors of various lights zipping through the sky, changed in colors and moved irradicately.;2013-11-26 01:00:00;1 hour;Many different colors of various lights zipping through the sky, changed in colors and moved irradicately. For about an hour now I have been watching strange lights in the sky.  The change in color from white, green, red, orange and blue.  They have been zipping across the sky irregularly.  They will occasionally meet up and then zoom away quickly.  They look like stars moving across the sky.  I can’t say how many exactly because of how quickly they were all moving, but it seemed to be 4-6 if not more.   I am now terrified and will not sleep for the rest of the night.;42.1113;-73.5526
