Bluish-white Sphere;2008-11-14 04:28:00;30 Seconds;At 0427 hrs I went out to my car to get my soda.  While in my car I saw out of the corner of my eye a bright light moving across the sky maybe 1000 feet off the ground.   So I turned to look at it thinking it was a plane landing at Albany International Airport.  But the light was too bright to be a landing light and it was going in the wrong direction.  Planes landing at the airport have to land either north to south, south to north or east to west.  This was going west to east.   It looked to be a bluish-white Sphere.   I watched it for 20 to 30 seconds until it disappeared into the clouds above Troy, NY.   I donâ€™t know what it was but my friend told me to report it so I am.;42.7470000000001;-73.7527000000004
