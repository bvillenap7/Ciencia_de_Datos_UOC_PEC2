Multiple UFOs Flying in 2 Triangular Arrows (Like Geese Flying South);2009-12-12 18:28:00;7min;Multiple UFOs Flying in 2 Triangular Arrows (Like Geese Flying South) Possible UFO Sighting Saturday, December 12, 2009 18:28-18:35   I just returned home from work and pulled into my apartment complex, I stepped out of my vehicle and looked up into the sky.  I saw two V shapes composed of roughly 10 individual UFOs each (like geese flying south).  Each V would hold its form at the tip of the two arrows but the back of each V (2 or 3 UFOs) would move randomly for a brief moment, and then return to the V.   I followed the Vs down my apartment complex street for as long at they were in sight. The UFOs moved slightly faster then I could walk.     A man was walking down the street at the same time I was, (going to the bus stop).  He noticed the UFOs and tried to make conversation, but there was a language barrier.  He spoke Spanish and I could not understand him.  I then returned to my apartment and wrote down the time, date and drew what I hade just seen.   I called the UFO hotline after looking up the number on my computer and filled out this report. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  PD));42.7470000000001;-73.7527000000004
