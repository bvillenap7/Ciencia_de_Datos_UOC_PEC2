While traveling on route 110 south in Melville  I looked up through the skylight of my car and saw a silver cylinder shaped object a few hundred feet above us!  There was not a cloud in the sky , this object wasn't going very fast, almost like it was floating.  It was traveling north by north east.  I headed east on the Long Island expressway and lost it after a few minutes.  This object made no noise and there were no lights or wings visible;40.7970073170732;-73.4086219512195
