Large easily seen. looked like small globes of very bright white and golden colored light that seem to encircle each other. Very large, easily seen --there were 3 of them but 1 disappeared straight up into the night sky disappearing.  The other two conglomerates were about a mile apart one higher in the skuy than the other.  I could still see them while I was driving the 15 miles to my home from work. The other two people were as amazed as I was.  I tried calling the local paper but only got an answering machine.  I left a message.  They probably think I am a crackpot.  I have never seen anything like this before.;40.7970073170732;-73.4086219512195
