Color changing sphere circles sky over WNY.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a star, possibly Sirius.  PD));2016-11-05 00:15:00;1 hour +;Color changing sphere circles sky over WNY. Just after midnight on Friday (I listed date as Saturday because it officially was) I was returning home from work.  I stepped into my backyard to use the bathroom.  I observed an object in the south east direction that appeared to be spherical in shape and was changing colors.  The object was moving north east then appeared to change direction and head south.  I watched it then drop elevation and it appeared to be circling.  I took a series of photos and went back inside.  I zoomed in on the photos expecting to debunk them but was shocked to see it was a sphere shaped object.  I have it in several colors.  I went back out and took two videos.  I am 39 years old and an avid outdoorsman.  I observed this object for over an hour.  I have never witnessed anything close to this ever.;42.6384;-78.5418
