It was flying in a northwest direction as it flew past my house in Holland, New York.  It appeared to have a circular shape as the main lights, 4 of them, were in a circular pattern.   These were visible in dark night sky.  The lights had different colors and I think there was 1 curved line of light going between 2 of the main lights.   As I recall I think the main lights were blinking.  It’s not likely to have been a plane  as it was quite low in the sky and at 1 point it was not visible as it passed behind my tall Norway Spruce trees.  I don’t know too much about satellites but I think they would be higher in sky too.;42.6384;-78.5418
