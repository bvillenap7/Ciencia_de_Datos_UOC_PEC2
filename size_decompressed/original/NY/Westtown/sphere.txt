Blue star dissapeared then reapeared above an aircraft and followed it then dissapeared again.;2018-12-07 16:26:00;2 minutes;Blue star dissapeared then reapeared above an aircraft and followed it then dissapeared again. I cant recall the name of the road but I believe it was Ridgeburry Rd.  I was on but it was in Westtown and I was driving north.  I saw a light in the east/ north-east it was about 10° to 15° above the horizon.  It was bright enough that I pulled my car over by a pasture with cattle and got out of my car to take a better look.  This was at about 425pm.  The sky was generally cloudless and the sun was almost down.  It did not move so Id thought it was a star, it twinkled like one.  I though it was Possibly venus however it was blue,  like how whitelights can appear blue,  not like a blue led but still between blue and white.  If it was a star,  it was several times brighter than any star id ever seen other than the sun.  Within about 60 seconds of my observing it the star vanished.  It was instantaneous.  I looked at the place where it had been for maybe 20 to 30 seconds before giving up on seeing it again.   As I was getting back in my car I looked up at an airli! ner above my head.  There once again was the blue star only this time it was moving at the same pace as the airliner.  There were no clouds, and it was right at dawn so I couldnt guess its elevation, only that I believe it was above the plane by a possibly 2 or 3 hundred feet and it was over its right wing,  The airliner was flying southwest.  Whatever it was stayed with the airliner untill the plane began turning east.  Just as the plane began to do this the blue light disappeared again just as suddenly as before.  When I checked the time again it was 4:28pm.;41.3223;-74.5541
