Two sightings in two weeks over Bay Shore, NY;2007-09-17 01:00:00;10 minutes - I got scared;Two sightings in two weeks over Bay Shore, NY There were two events this month I witnessed while looking at the stars and smoking on my second floor deck, which overlooks the Great South Bay:  The first event, September 13th or 14th at approximately 11pm, I witnessed a formation of maybe five or six white lights that appeared to shoot up and down, in angular NE, NW, SE, SW patterns almost dive-bombing into each other.  They stayed in one general area and I watched for a few minutes before going inside and locking the door!   The second event, last night (September 17th) at approximately 12am, I witnessed three red blinking lights flying very quickly across the sky.  They were separated several miles apart from one another and all three had very rapid red blinking lights.  It appeared that they would shoot to the East, hover for a moment, drop and move in another direction.  I called my boyfriend outside and to witness this sighting and he laughed at me for being concerned!   Apparently, he has witnessed several sightings while camping with his family and is comfortable with the fact that there's always things flying around out there.   If they are curious and kind I see no reason to be afraid, but I have seen too many movies to not be fear the worst first!;40.7053145833334;-73.2438927083335
