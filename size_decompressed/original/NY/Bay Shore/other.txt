Stripped light formation, shaped like a bird, moved in waves across the sky;2019-11-03 19:00:00;30 seconds;Stripped light formation, shaped like a bird, moved in waves across the sky At night, this light formation flew across the sky, across the marina parking lot and towards the water, a height that was above the lampposts, at an even pace for about 30 seconds until it faded away, It looked lifelike except that all you could see was light and shadow in a stripped pattern. It was shaped like big bird wings, but bigger than any bird I’ve ever seen on Long Island. The way it moved was bird like too, but slower, and wavelike, almost like a swimming motion. It was not easily visible, it was almost camouflaged by night, the dim striped lights exposed it. When I first saw the wavelike light formation. I tried to make sense of it, maybe it is a bird, white with shadows but it just didn’t make sense, how is the light so perfectly striped across this wing like formation.  the only other light around were lamppost, they wouldn’t have that effect. Also I should be able to see, know and recognize a bird, it wasn’t that far away from me, and I was focusing on it for half a minute until It eventually faded with some distance. The things that were obvious includes the stripped light, the slow/even wave like motion, and bigger than a seagull. it’s something I’ve never seen before, something I was surprised, confused by immediately, and tried but couldn’t make sense out of.;40.7053145833334;-73.2438927083335
