Two fireballs seen flying over Bay shore neighborhood;2012-04-21 17:45:00;1 minute;two fireballs seen flying over Bay shore neighborhood We were in our back yard when 2 orange glowing discs appeared over my husbands shoulder.  At first I thought it was a firework,and said to him...what is that.  They were over our tree tops sound less. It was as if they were racing each other.  They were not flying in straight lines. We both would not have believe the other, so we were thankful we both saw it.  Neither one of us has ever seen anything like that before.
