Strange red lights over Bay Shore;2003-07-11 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;Strange red lights over Bay Shore While coming home from work driving east on Sunrise Highway in eastern Bay Shore, I saw what appeared to be a hovering helicopter in the northeast sky. It looked to be over maybe Islip Terrace or so....   I made the next exit onto a side street to see the helicopter, but it was blocked out by trees.  Instead, going northwest towards Brentwood and Commack, I saw a pair of red lights side by side.  They looked pretty far apart, so if they were on airplane wingtips, either the plane was very large, or flying very low.   I had gotten out of my vehicle by this point and heard nothing.  I also saw no other lights between them to suggest any kind of airplane I've ever seen (like a tail light or something).  It kept moving away from me at a pretty fast pace and faded from view in the northwest sky.;40.7053145833334;-73.2438927083335
