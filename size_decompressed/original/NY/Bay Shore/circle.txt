Is that Venus? the Planet?  he looked up and asked where I said there, to the left of the moon past the clouds passinig by vertically.  They were stratus clouds. I got up and moved and when I returned he said. It disappeared. it must have been a ufo.   I did  not believe in them before but now I do.  We kept looking up and it did not come back.  It was very very high in the sky. it looked like a dot next to the moon. ((NUFORC Note:  Object may have been satellite, although that is a guess.  If the object was, in fact, moving, it was not one of the planets that currently are in proximity to the Moon during the early evening.  PD));40.7053145833334;-73.2438927083335

One pulsating circle captured my attention as it was stationary. I thought it maybe a Helicopter until I ran in the house to grab my binoculars. It was this crazy pulsating multi colored lights that was shifting to the north, then it would stop..then shift again. It was so low it started to wig me out. It was huge, not a drone. I can't imagine it was a satellite so low, right above the houses. Then it ascended and disappeared.;40.7053145833334;-73.2438927083335
