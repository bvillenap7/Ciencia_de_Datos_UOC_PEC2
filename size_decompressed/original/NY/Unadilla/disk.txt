breath taking view;2006-12-14 23:00:00;1 hour;breath taking view i live in the country on mountain clear open view of valley and hills around beautiful clear night, saw what i thought was shooting stars, then many all over, thought i truly was seeing things then i saw in clear view about 30 feet away.  a very large disk shaped stopped over trees then split into four separate ships they flew off then stopped as in covering a square of the sky i then saw them shooting beems of light onto the ground i went in to get camera and tried to wake up husband he thought i was nuts of course and stayed asleep lol grabbed camera took pics but none came out at all. it continued for an hour i sat on the porch in awe it was like watching movie. talked to my friend next day she was over the hill from me saw similar thing she also said there was a meteor shower. i did not call this sighting in for obvious reasons but honestly while watching i felt no fear just amazement.;42.3287;-75.3393
