I walked my dog out into the yard and I noticed two bright objects in the sky.  At first I asked myself if Venus may be out, but noticed these two objects were too close together to be the two brightest stars in the sky (and also too large and bright),so I kept my focus on them. All of a sudden I saw one of them dash straight up and out of view within a second.  The second object stayed there a moment and did the same thing about a second later.  Much, much too fast to be any type of jet, and much, much too bright.;42.4077;-74.0201

After 15 minutes, it rose, but stayed in same area.  No noise.  Object did not move away or towards me.  I also took video.  Odd thing is I have helicopters passing over at nite, as well, with no lights! ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.4077;-74.0201
