Shiny, silver, cigar-shaped object appeared out of hazy clouds;2005-05-05 17:30:00;5 seconds;Shiny, silver, cigar-shaped object appeared out of hazy clouds On May 5, 2005, while driving west on Interstate 84 between Greenville and Port Jervis, New York, at approximately 5:30 pm, I witnessed a shiny, silver, cigar-shaped object poking out of a hazy cloud.  It almost looked like the blade of a knife.   I observed the object for approximately 3 seconds, and then the object appeared to get thinner and it looked like it dropped out of the sky.   The object was huge, because right before it disappeared, a jet heading toward New York, flying at approximately 3,000 feet, was passing near it in the sky.  The jet was dwarfed by the object.;42.4077;-74.0201
