Guard dogs on the hunt;1991-01-20 03:00:00;5 minutes;Guard dogs on the hunt I was asleep in my bed with my former husband when i was internally awoken by an invasion of killer dogs. Sounds funny but not. I was immediately terrified and hid under my covers all the time seeing it happen and sweating profusely.  The dogs were Rotweiller in nature, stood on hind feet only, carried lazer rifles with back packs and ran in, pointed the gun nozzles at my face...quiet....then they retreated back out of my front door to my suite. When i knew i could uncover myself, i did so and was paralized with fear for quite sometime and as you can see....it was and is very serious business to me still today.
