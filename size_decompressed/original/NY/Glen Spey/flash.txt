I stood there and watched the colors flash from red to blue to orange for little over half an hour until I called and reported it.  Their first thought was too a star, be it Sirius or just a twinkling star until I further described. I got off the phone at 3:15am and proceeded to watch until about 3:19 at which time the craft flashed a bright violet color and darted towards the right and then disappeared.
