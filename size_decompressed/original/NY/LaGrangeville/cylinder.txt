Thought a commercial airliner was about to crash...;2009-10-15 22:00:00;3 seconds;Thought a commercial airliner was about to crash... While driving East on route 55, just west of where it intersects with the Taconic State Parkway, my wife and I saw what seemed to be a commercial airliner in a completely vertical position, only a few hundred feet off the ground, and heading towards the ground so quickly that both of us fully expected to see or hear an explosion.  When it disappeared behind the tree line, it seemed to us to be maybe a half mile away, and we sped up to what we thought would be the scene of a crash site. Of course, there was no crash, and we tuned in a local radio station to see if there had been an airplane crash in the area.  There was none. This area is across the Hudson River from Stewart Air base, now a commercial airport, and we are both very used to seeing fairly low commercial and military planes, including the huge C-5 Galaxy military transport planes. We only saw the lights for at best 3 seconds, and other than the fact that there were several colored lights which seemed to be along the fuselage of what we thought was the plane (which is unusual) the only thing we could reasonably come up with was that it was a large commercial jet.  Both of us agree there were white, green, and red lights. I’m reporting this because it isn’t possible for a plane of that size to be going that fast in a vertical position straight down, that close to the ground, and not crash.  Neither of us can explain how that would be possible, so we’ve questioned if what we saw was a plane.   This is not the only time I've reported a sighting to your website, but this is certainly the shortest sighting, and yet still very strange.
