Gray bottom oval shaped craft hovering above tree top..;1974-07-20 21:00:00;50 seconds;Gray bottom oval shaped craft hovering above tree top.. I was standing next to my window in an upstairs apartment on Sly Avenue washing dishes.  I noticed out the window at the sight of three fire balls it looked like they were coming at me, one was orange, yellow and red.   I ran out of kitchen and out onto my porch looking up into the sky, right directly above the tree top it appeared to be an oval shaped possible ufo no lights on just hovering above the tree.   I turned my porch light on and immediately whatever it was shot through the sky, the sound it made I never heard before and it vanished..   It was unreal, yes I do believe in UFO's I saw one..
