craft made no noise and leveled and lowered into field.;1971-08-10 22:00:00;approx. 5 min.;craft made no noise and leveled and lowered into field. craft was hoving in one spot, tilted alittle. you could see antennea on the tips on both sides, from the  lights from Big Flats made details easier to see. On the top part there were white lights, they almost looked like little windows. and on the bottom  the was colored light rotating around  the circumferences, or they were flickering off and on giving the impression that they were rotating. the craft leveled off and dropped down into a back field. There was no noise at all.  MY girlfriend and I started to go up to check it out and changed our minds. We were at the top of Hickock Rd in the town of Corning, looking toward the electric station in Big Flats and the Corning Elmira airport is approx 5-10 miles away from where we were.;42.143;-77.0456999999998
