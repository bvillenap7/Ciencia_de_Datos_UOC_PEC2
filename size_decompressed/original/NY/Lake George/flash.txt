Bright lights that changed color seen on  ground with corresponding area power surge.;2003-09-22 03:00:00;5 minutes;Bright lights that changed color seen on  ground with corresponding area power surge. My husband and I, both in our late 30's, were awakened by a power surge in our home.  The computer turned on, the radio turned on etc.  We live on the top of a mountain so we have a good view of the surrounding mountains and valleys.  In the valley adjacent tour home the sky was bright white, after a minute or 2, there was a green light glowing from the ground, that lasted about a minute, then the light turned orange.  At that point I ran to the telephone to call the police.  When I returned to my bedroom, the colored lights were gone.  After a couple of minutes it looked as if a car had come to investigate.  We saw the headlights of the car aimed at the spot where the occurrence had taken place.  We went to sleep quite agitated, but thought possibly it was some sort of accident that occurred.  This morning I contacted the local police, and local fire departments, they had no reports of an accident.  I have asked others around town if they knew of what may have happened.  One other man that I spoke with said that he also saw bright lights last night. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length via telephone, and she sounded quite objective and credible.  She is going to attempt to locate other witnesses, and will contact the power company again.  PD));43.4156999999999;-73.7023000000001
