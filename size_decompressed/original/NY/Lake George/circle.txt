Reddish-Orange Sphere over Lake George Village NY;2013-08-04 21:05:00;2-4 minutes;Reddish-Orange Sphere over Lake George Village NY Approximately 9:05pm on August 4th, I was walking North on Canada Street in Lake George Village, when I saw a strange Reddish-Orange object in the sky.  I was with my wife & another couple and they stopped and looked as well.  I had seen it move slightly south.  It was in the east-northeastern sky approximately at mid-upper flight level.  It then appeared to almost stop in one spot.  I then proceeded to take a picture of it through my high zoom camera.   Shortly after I took the shot, it then began to fade in the spot it was in and within seconds vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
