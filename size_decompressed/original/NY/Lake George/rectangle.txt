Hovering object over  Lake George defies logic;2006-10-08 14:00:00;5 minutes;Hovering object over  Lake George defies logic Looking up over the top of Pilot Knob while on a leaf peeping boat cruise we observed a shiny thin rectangle shaped craft hovering stationary. We stopped the boat to look at it as the lack of movement caught our eye. As we watched, it drifted to our left then faded away, they sky was clear blue without a cloud in the sky so it really puzzled us as to where it went.... we resumed the cruise with one eye on the sky when it appeared again over the mountain top, this time a little closer, again hovering stationary. after a few minutes it drifted to the right and once again faded away, disappeared. what was really odd was the shape, like looking at a plane from the side without wings. Just a silver rectangle very narrow though, no contrails, no noise, nothing. the way it hung in the air with no wobble or any visual monement except for when it drifted to the side before just fading away in thin air. There was no way this was a conventional aircraft. All four of us agreed that this was going to be hard to explain.;43.4156999999999;-73.7023000000001
