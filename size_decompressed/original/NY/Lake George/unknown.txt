Orange/red object in the sky.;2015-04-27 22:00:00;5 minutes;Orange /red object in the sky. My wife and I went for our usual coffee run up to Lake George in our car and I was driving we were heading north up Canada street when I noticed a orange/red glow in the sky I said to my wife (look someone is camping on the mountain with a camp fire) than we both realized that it was moving, we turned left by the school and stopped in the road and watched as it went over Lake George village,  we were worried that it was a airplane with engine trouble, so we went right to warren county airport but it was all quiet, we went home called the warren county sheriff the officer said it was most likely a Chinese kite with a candle, NO WAY it went all the way across the sky from over the mountain from the north west to the south east in a controlled flight in a general heading to the airport.;43.4156999999999;-73.7023000000001
