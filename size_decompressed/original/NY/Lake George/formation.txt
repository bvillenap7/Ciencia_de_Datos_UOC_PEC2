The bright;2009-01-03 09:00:00;3 minutes;I have on video a bright light above French Mountain that hovered for several minutes of which I have few minutes on video. The bright light dimmed and as clear as can be is a shape of a UFO. Not a saucer shape that I have seen on tv, but a shape that I can only describe as an ornate Christmas ornament. On the video you can see the UFO vanish, it doesn't go behind trees or drops below the mountain top, but vanishes like it takes off straight away. I have showed the video to my wife and friends and they agree its a UFO. When I spotted the bright light I called my friend across the street to look out his window and he watched it too although he did not video it.;43.4156999999999;-73.7023000000001
