Small points of light moving randomly;1996-07-01 03:00:00;1 or more hours;Small points of light moving randomly While vacationing at Lake George, NY about 10 years ago, a small group of friends and I went for a walk by the lake around 3:00 AM.  It was a very clear, star-lit night, and we were all clear-headed (none of us use alcohol or drugs). Over the space of an hour or so, we observed one or more single points of white light, about the same size and brightness as a dim star or a man-made satelite, moving randomly in a small area of the sky, almost directly overhead, high above the earth. I would have guessed that they were man-made satelites, but they didn't travel in a continuous straight line across the sky, and they moved slower than satelites.  I would also have guessed that they were extremely high-flying aircraft, but their movements were not like aircraft--they would move slowly in a straight line for a while, then make turns that were too sudden for an aircraft, sometimes at angles close to 90 degrees. I don't recall seeing more than one in motion at a time.  If we stared at the area of the sky in which these objects were appearing, it would appear as though one of the stars would begin to move, and then for the next several minues, we would watch it move randomly as I described above. I never reported this, but I talk about it with my friends from time to time. We ask one another, as we did that night, Did I really see that? and the answer is, Yes.

String of white twinkling Christmas lights.;2014-07-26 22:00:00;7-10 minutes;String of white twinkling Christmas lights. At 10:03 p.m. myself, a former law enforcement agent, and my boyfriend, a high school teacher, observed a string of lights in the sky from the Assembly Point peninsula.  The lights looked like a string of white Christmas lights that were twinkling brightly and then dimmed while gaining more distance upward.  They seemed close at first, and we thought they were remnants of fireworks we heard earlier, but they continued traveling and dimming with distance.   I tried to get my telescope to focus in on them, but couldn't in time.   The sighting lasted between 7-10 minutes.

I thought it was drone but the light was too big and too far away for a drone.;2015-06-05 21:30:00;10 minutes;I thought it was drone, but the light was too big and too far away for a drone. I was in Lake George, NY, for bike week and on June 5th.  Approximately 2130, my two friends and I were sitting in a park waiting for the fireworks to begin.  I looked to the north and saw a redish/orange light all of a sudden that wasn’t there a few minutes ago.  I watched the light as it moved very slowly across the sky.  Then all of a sudden the movements became very rapid and started moving up and down and all around ….then it just stopped. I asked my two friends next to me if they see it and they had also noticed it.  We watched for a few more minutes and then is slowly sank behind the trees in the horizon. About 10-15 to fifteen minutes later it reappeared to the south of us….many many miles from where it was originally seen.  It seemed to hover and then move slowly and then it sped up and stopped.  It stayed there until the fireworks began and then seemed to mover directly over-head of them. It stayed there and seemed to “watch” what was going on until the fireworks ending and just disappeared by seemingly moving higher up in the sky until it just disappeared It never came back.;43.4156999999999;-73.7023000000001
