Extremely shiny object seen making strange manuevers in a cloudless afternoon sky.;2012-08-26 18:00:00;30 seconds;Extremely shiny object seen making strange manuevers in a cloudless afternoon sky. I am a taxi driver of 11 years. I was driving southbound on interstate 87.  It was a sunny late afternoon, with not a cloud in the sky. I looked up at the sky and saw the moon was out early.  To the right side of the moon, about an inch away from it, (estimated distance using an intelligent guess) far off in the distance was an extremely shiny, cigar-shaped object. The object was much too far away to get a clear look at any distinguishing features.  But the object was intensely reflective as if it was made of polished steel.  There did not appear to be any light eminating from the object, and there was no sign of a trail in the sky as if it was a plane. I noticed that the object was moving at a rapid rate of speed, considering the distance from me.  Then it moved up, across, and back down. I tried to keep an eye on it, but it disappeared from sight.  I continued to scan the cloudless sky as I made my way down the highway, but I could no longer see the object anywhere.;43.4156999999999;-73.7023000000001
