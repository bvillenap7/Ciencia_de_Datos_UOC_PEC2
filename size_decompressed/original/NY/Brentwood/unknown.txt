No streak as you would see with a 'falling star'.  I have seen in my lifetime objects streak as it came through the atmosphere....i have never seen one not streak....and change to those colors....it was the quick gray spot after turning red that made me wonder.  To make sure I saw that color i asked my daughter what she saw in color sequence and it was what I saw.  The gray color....was not a light but seemed more reflective.;40.7801;-73.2458
