I looked up at the night sky and saw what it looked like to me as a star moving across the sky, it came up from the south east and took a sort of round trip coming closer and then going out of view in the sky in the north eastern direction.  It was closer to the earth then the stars because it would pass over a few of them. It was very bright, about the same brightness as a normal star would look.  I really hope someone else has seen it.   This is my first sighting ever of a ufo but i have been looking for them for a long time.  I finally got my chance.;40.7383;-73.1322

She called for us to come out.  There was a orange and red circular object hanging in the sky.   The object was a deeper red in the middle and an orange on the outer circle.  It flashed for a moment expanding its size then proceeding to slowly head Northwest at a moderate pace then changing course upwards, hanging for another moment and then just disappearing.  I have a few seconds of video of the event before it vanished.  One thing to note there has been a noticeable increase in military activity in the area the last 12 hours, including fighter interceptors and Boeing P-8 recon aircraft, seen earlier in the day.;40.7383;-73.1322
