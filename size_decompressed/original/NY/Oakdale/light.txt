Giant red glowing orb, sitting above sunrise highway;2019-11-28 00:30:00;20 minutes;Giant red glowing orb, sitting above sunrise highway Saw red glowing craft hovering directly above sunrise highway around 12:30 am while driving.  The craft hovered in place for a while then lifted straight up and zig zagged a little, staying in view.  I was able to keep track of it from backseat of car for over 20 minutes, that’s how large this thing was!  It was way too big to be a helicopter or plane- it was a giant red glowing object similar to reports and sightings  I’ve heard from our area in the past.;40.7383;-73.1322
