6 slow moving fireballs seen in western sky on Long Island;2011-08-06 21:30:00;15 minutes;6 slow moving fireballs seen in western sky on Long Island I am a private pilot/amateur astronomer and i witnessed what appeared to be a slow moving fireball in the western sky moving from south to north.  The sky was cloudy and it was beginning to rain.  The object moved at the speed of a single engine aircraft.  It was silent and flickered orange.  It did not have multiple lights or aviation colored lights.  Six more lights appeared and moved in same direction.  They could have been flares suspended by balloons.  I did not see any string or balloons and they did not leave a trail of smoke but it is the best guess I could make to determine what they were.  They were approx. 45 deg above the horizon.;40.7383;-73.1322
