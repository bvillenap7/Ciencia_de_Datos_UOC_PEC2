I thought it was strange and I watched it for 20 minutes then I felt it was watching something over my town of 8,500. So I went and got my Olympus camera with film. So I took a picture then I felt like it spotted me and after I took the picture the cloud or object completely disappeared. I have the picture will try to find it and attached if I can. Respectfully I felt strange from watching it?;42.3256000000001;-77.6593000000001
