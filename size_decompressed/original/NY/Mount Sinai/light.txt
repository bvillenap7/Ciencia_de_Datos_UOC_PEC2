I look out my back window and through the trees I see a bright ball of pulsating light.  I just stared at it because at first I thought it was the moon or a bright star.  But it seemed different because of how much it was pulsating or going from dim to bright.  It also seemed to be slowing moving around in sort of a small circle.  It would appear stationary if you just glance at it but when I looked closely it was making small movements.  Then in an instant, it took off to the right from nearly stationary to just gone!   I've never seen anything like it in my life!  Was a pale yellow light that dimmed and brightened.;40.9348;-73.01
