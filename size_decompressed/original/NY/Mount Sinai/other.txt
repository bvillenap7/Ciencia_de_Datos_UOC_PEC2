Vertical disk shaped craft with red/white light very low scanning area;2011-08-31 20:30:00;20 seconds;Vertical disk shaped craft with red/white light very low scanning area It was a few days after hurricane Irene and the earthquake. It was just past sunset. My wife and I go for walks normally at this time. This evening as we were walking my wife Saw an object moving very slowly and very low (150 feet). The object was unlike anything reported anywhere else. It had a large red light on the front of it which was also white in the center and it was diamond shaped. There was a vertically oriented disk that the light was mounted to. This craft of approximately 15 feet in diameter moved at a constant rate of about 3 meters per second from right to left of us for distance of about 100 feet and stopped.  It rotated on its vertical axis and commenced forward heading away from us.  When it rotated it difd so with precision.  It traveled a short distance, stopped and rotated 90 degrees making a square and traveled past the tree line and we lost visual.  The conditions were: clear night, temp was 75 degrees, wind 0-3 knots, range of 800 feet. The entire duration of observation there was absolute silence except for some crickets. Personal note:  This observation was close and provided such unaided detail that I could see the edge of the vertical 'backboard' and could estimate its thickness to be approximately 8 inches thick.  That craft being that close scared the heck out of us.  I've worked in the military and commercial engineering field for overy 30 years, manned and unmanned and I know it's not terrestrial.  They're definitely eatching us.;40.9348;-73.01
