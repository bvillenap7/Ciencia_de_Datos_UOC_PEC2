A large orange colored round object traveling west to east at a high rate of speed.;2013-07-04 22:30:00;2 minutes;A large orange colored round object traveling west to east at a high rate of speed. We observed one round orange colored object traveling west to east.  The object was high in the night sky.  We saw nothing but a steady orange light.  It crossed the sky in a straight line.  It was traveling at a high rate of speed.   There was no sound as the object passed overhead.  It took less than 2 minutes from horizon to horizon.   Making a comparison, a star would be the size of a dime, this object was larger than a silver dollar. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
