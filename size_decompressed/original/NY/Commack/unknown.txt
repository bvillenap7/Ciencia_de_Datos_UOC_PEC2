I don't know what I saw, but I know what I saw.;2011-08-09 01:00:00;4 seconds;I don't know what I saw, but I know what I saw. I was looking northeast at 70 degrees up at the stars.  I then started to look north at 40 degrees. The sky was completely dark when out of nowhere a shooting star type bright light appeared and like a pencil drawing a line from point to point it stopped traveling very abruptly.  In a second or two after the light stopped, the bright light faded away at once. This tail of light wasn't thin and did not cover a substantial distance across the sky as a shooting star would've.  It had a thickness to it and a short length.  It traveled from right to left (east to west) perfectly horizontal.  I'd say it was 2-3 miles from where I was standing and there were no clouds.  I seriously think this was a UFO jumping/propelling into a wormhole. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
