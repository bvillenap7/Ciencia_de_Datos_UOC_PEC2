Egg Shaped Ufo Over Long Island NY;2000-11-01 03:00:00;3 min;Egg Shaped Ufo Over Long Island NY One day in november i awoke to to a light coming from my sliding glass door in the back of my house. I was confused by this. I walked to the window wondering what was going on. I looked out and saw a large egg shaped craft. The craft was about  500 ft away and 100 ft in the air. The craft  was glowing yellow the light filled my living room. The craft then moved left slowly and turned an dark orange and stoped.The craft hovered again for about 15 sec.The craft moved upward and to the right and now glowed a very light blue.The craft  now was about 500 ft away and 150 ft in the air. The Craft moved away to about 600 ft away and then sped away at incredable speed straight up in the air and disapeared. I thought that the craft was a helicopter and went to bed. After i thaught about what i had seen i realized that a helicopter couldnt move that way and that a helicopter would have made noise which the craft  had not and a helicopter has only one color. The next day i went to the site where i had seen this craft and found a large area of dryed grass. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.8434046511628;-73.2814302325582
