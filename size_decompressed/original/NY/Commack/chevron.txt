Long Island on day of 9/11 World Trade Center Bombing;2001-09-11 15:00:00;20 seconds?;Long Island on day of 9/11 World Trade Center Bombing My sighting happened hours after the 9/11 World Trade Center bombing. I live on the North Shore of Long Island in Suffolk County. On the day of 9/11, at around 3:00 Pm I was standing in my driveway watching my kids do skateboarding tricks. I saw 3 chevron shaped dark colored objects flying soundlessly in formation just north of my house. They did not move like ordinary planes, and seemed to zip about.I’ve never seen anything like this. I told my kids to look up at the sky, but they were busy skateboarding and had no interest. Here’s where it gets weird, one of the objects dropped a large dull grey metallic egg shaped object from a hatch underneath. I thought it was a bomb, and I waited in fear for an explosion which never occurred. The 3 flying objects disappeared from my sight as they seemed to be flying east, following the coastline of Long Islands North shore. I live only several miles from the Long Island Sound, and I believe that the egg shaped object was deliberately dropped into the water. I have searched the internet to see if anyone else saw this, and I’ve never found any reports.;40.8434046511628;-73.2814302325582

The night sky was clear and I always look up to see the stars.  I saw a dark, boomerang shaped object pass overhead well below airline traffic going from East to West.  There were approximately six round shaped objects of the same size on the bottom side (possibly could have been lights)unlit, but seemed they could have been slightly illuminated.  It moved at a steady, quiet speed.  As I watched it pass over my house it seemed to disappear in the night sky. No visible lights to follow its movement.;40.8434046511628;-73.2814302325582
