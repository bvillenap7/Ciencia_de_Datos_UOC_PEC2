3 orbs dancing/chasing each other in circles in Sanborn, NY.  ((anonymous report));2016-09-29 23:30:00;10 minutes;3 orbs dancing/chasing each other in circles in Sanborn, NY. I was driving down a busy straight road when all of a sudden it looked like a white light shot straight up into the sky on my left hand side.  So i pulled over and my girlfriend and I could see 3 orbs moving around as if they were dancing or chasing each other.  This went on for about 10 minutes until slowly the moved location went higher up in the sky and seemed like they drifted away.
