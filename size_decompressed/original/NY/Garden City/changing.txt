((HOAX??))  One Enflamed craft and large craft above feild.;2007-01-02 23:42:00;3 minutes;One Enflamed craft and large craft above feild. I was in a local feild, Using my telescope. When looking at stars. I scanned by to look at another. And saw 2 mysterious craft. One disk shaped with a red light inside. And one very large one with a blue light inside. Out of no where. The red lighted craft went on fire. At that moment I got the most detail of it. I saw the reflections of the fire on metal with symbols. None ive everseen, The inflamed craft came down, In the feild. I decided since I have a phone with me, To take a picture of it. After the Click! of the picture, The fire on the craft engulfed the whole craft and vansished, With only one clue left. A peice of metal. Its symbol was what seemed like the alleged Crop Circle Shapes. I took the metal to a neerby cop (who was one of the witnesses) When he was examining the metal. It glowed a vomit-like green. (only the symbol was glowing) and the blue lighted craft flew overhead. The metal vanished like the ship. And the blue craft flew upwards, And went through the cloud layer without making a hole in the cloud! Normally, I wasnt superspicious, But now, This experiance made me belive were not alone.  [Note: The witnesses didnt give contact info] ((NUFORC Note:  Witness identifies self as a college student.  Possible hoaxed report, we believe.  PD));40.7247367924529;-73.6476273584906
A birdlike object or missile became an orb, joined other orbs, before ascending and disappearing.;2015-04-17 17:55:00;2 minutes;A birdlike object or missile became an orb, joined other orbs, before ascending and disappearing. On Friday April 17, 2015-today in fact, at first I saw an object that looked like a bird flying up in the air not too far from a jet, which I assume was on a flight path for a landing at either JFK or LaGuardia airport nearby. It was 5:55 pm, sunny, and most people in suburbia here on Long Island were on their way home from work. What caught my attention first was the fact that the object was up so high. And the next fact was that although it appeared bird like, it was traveling at a high rate of speed. It looked white at first then silver. In fact, it was going faster than the jet!  It had descended and as I watched (with my prescription sunglasses on), from my car in a parking field,Â the object went from a northeasterly direction on my right towards the west on my left. I grabbed for my phone to take a photo but decided to keep watching instead-the object became an orb joining another orb that spun around it.  The two continued on then met up with another 3 or 4 orbs encircling them before ascending and disappearing! This was near Roosevelt Field, Long Island, NY.  A Marines base is nearby. Is this military? Does the FAA know about this, I'm a former newspaper reporter and editor.;40.7247367924529;-73.6476273584906
