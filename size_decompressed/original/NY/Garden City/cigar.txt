I saw something in the western sky at about 9:30 AM on 6/2/2010.  It was long (like a fuselage) but without wings.  It seemed metallic and I estimated that it was hovering at about 10,000 feet.  I called to my friends who were nearby and they were dumbfounded.  They were as perplexed as I was.   Did anyone else report anythig suspicious on that date and time?
