Standing in my yard talking to my neighbor, we tend to look up.  We saw a lit up craft traveling northeast at a fast velocity.   Then, by my fence, facing south above a large tree on the corner of my eye as my neighbor is looking south east, a huge bright white/blueish flash went off above the tree and a ray if light same color as described, pretty wide ray of light traveled south right after the flash, my neighbor looks south west and sees a craft darting off west.   It shook me to the core, it was low, bright flash that lit up the sky, like a flash from a camera.  I had goose bumps and got a little scared, it was intense.;40.7856;-73.193
