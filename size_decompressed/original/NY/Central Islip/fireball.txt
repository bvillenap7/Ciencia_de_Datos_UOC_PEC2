This was no ordinary green light....................;2004-02-16 21:30:00;20 seconds;This was no ordinary green light.................... My husband,9yr. old son and I were coming to the traffic light on Hawthorne Ave and Half Mile Rd. when we witnessed a green fireball shaped light pass over our car and head southwest over our neighborhood. It was too low to be an aircraft from our near by airport.It seemed to disappear over the houses and in the trees. It didn't fade away into the sky like a normal airplane or helicopter, it disappeared! It was defenitley not a firework because fireworks would burn out over such a distance and also leave a trail of fire from it's tail as it passes you, this did not!No sound either!My husband is a volunteer fireman and he also agrees that it was no firework or known aircraft. I never would have wanted to believe it if I hadn't read the same exact discriptions on this site, now I am convinced my family and I had our first ufo experience and it makes my hair stand on end now that I think about it, to be honest,but still curious!;40.7856;-73.193
