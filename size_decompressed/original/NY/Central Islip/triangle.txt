Huge Triangle UFO;1991-06-01 16:00:00;2-5 minutes;Huge Triangle UFO I can't remember the date exactly but i believe it was 1990 or 1991. My story begins when i and a friend was going back to our block in which we live on. We both was coming back from a girls house that lived only a block over. When we left and turned down the corner heading towards our block. My friend & i see a huge craft. The color was that of and outside street lamp post. Orange yellow glow emitted from this triangular UFO. We both pointed just like the movies and realized that we needed someone else to witness this. We ran 2 blocks down to another friends house. By the time we reached the corner of the other friends block the object was no where to be seen. After looking at the sky for a few seconds i managed to see the object. This thing was so far away it blew my mind on how it was so far away. After that we went to tell our other friend and he thought that we was playing games with him.  This UFO made no noise and when we first saw it i must say the size of this craft was large. Even to this day i see it in my mind like it was just yesterday. I tell everyone about my encounter. Strange part about this, is that my friend who witness this sighting with me speaks nothing of it because he feels that he would be made fun of. Indeed people have joked about it but i stick to my story and i win them over when they see i am being real about it. That day changed my worldview, I believe we are not alone.
