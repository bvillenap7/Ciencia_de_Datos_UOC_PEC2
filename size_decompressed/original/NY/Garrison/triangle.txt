We were in for about five minutes or so when I noticed a small cloud come into view over to the right. I kept my eye on it. I realized that it had stopped. How could a cloud float to a position then stop in midair? There was a breeze, so you would expect to see the cloud moving especially when it floated into view in the first place. I looked at it intensely. I asked it to show me some lights. All this time I did not mention it to my wife. She was enjoying her hot tub time and I did not want to disturb her. As I looked at the cloud, I could make out a triangle shape in the small cloud. There was some dim glowing light activity at the tip of the triangle behind the cloud. It looked like some movement of white orbs. It was slight but I could make it out. The triangle shape then became more profound and I noticed that in the background ! was another outline of a triangle that was getting smaller. An invisible triangle was rising straight up into the sky. The triangle shape had lifted out of the small cloud but still had cloud around it. I could see the original triangle shape in the cloud start to dissipate. I watched the shape rise into the sky, but it no longer had any cloud around to reveal its shape. It was gone. About six to eight seconds after that, the cloud that was standing still started to disappear. I knew that it was going to do that. The cloud was gone. There was a triangle shape that was hiding in that small cloud. Maybe it needed to become visible to interact with the glowing objects that I saw.;41.3631;-73.9203
