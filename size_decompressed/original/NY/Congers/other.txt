Please see other reports for this date.)) Two, possibly three comet-like objects in the nighttime western sky.  Appeared motionless and looked exactly like comets. Two close together comet-like objects hanging motionless in the sky.  Brief memory of a third farther away from the first two noticed.  I have seen a small number of UFO like manifestations in my past and study about them often so after the images did not move or change in any way after a short time I simply shrugged and walked back into the house.;41.1482;-73.9394000000001
blue rectangular shape moves north to south along horizon;2004-11-13 00:30:00;10 seconds;blue rectangular shape moves north to south along horizon Six adults, including myself, witnessed from a back yard in Congers an unidentified object moving from north to south, possibly following the Hudson River. Its shape was rectangular, with a dark line dividing it in half, almost like a kite. At first its color was a faint blue. It did not move in a straight line, its trajectory was erratic, dipping and rising quickly back up. It flew close to the horizon. About five minutes after it vanished, it came back again, traveling north to south like it had before. At first, it was rectangular and blue like during its first passing, but the 'kite-like' appearance changed to a simple white star-like point, and continued south. Either its appearance was distrupted by the atmosphere (though the sky was clear), or it changed shape.;41.1482;-73.9394000000001
Possible Time Machine.;2020-03-03 23:15:00;6 seconds;Possible Time Machine Beautiful moonlight night, with a few scattered clouds, I was looking at the “Bee Hive” stars with naked eye as I waiting for my dog to do her business. She then ran behind my legs and cowered,  Clouds moved and revealed a craft, seemed massive . It resembled an Air Force drone except no wings and about 1000 time bigger.  It was rectangular with curved corners, a engine (?) took up about half the front then up top a long line resembling a plane cockpit, with a few lights in the windows. It was air force grey, definitely seemed man made but nothing that I have never seen , and I am a military buff.   I looked away to tend to dog, looked back and it was still there, starting to move. No noise or bright lights or trails but it disappeared in a flash. I can still clearly see the image in my mind. I said why would they travel back to this time, there’s nothing much goin on. Then today, with the market crashing, the corona virus, the illnesses in Japan and France, kind of eerie.;41.1482;-73.9394000000001
