Low flying Large triangle Silent craft over suburbs of Large City;1982-08-18 21:00:00;5 Min;Low flying Large triangle Silent craft over suburbs of Large City Slow moving VERY large SILENT Black Triangle (slightly boomerang shaped)...backend curved in, no sharp corners with line of  small white lights in a row on rear of ship.   Seen over a busy highway, at 9:30 PM, low altitude-less than 500ft???  I pulled of the side of the road to watch and rolled down the window to make sure I wasn't seeing reflections or whatever.   I don't know if anyone else reported it, nothing on the news.   There is Hancock military airbase nearby and  commercial Hancock Airport located next to each other, probably within 7 miles of the sighting.  I had never heard of the triangle sightings or anything similar-so I was really stumped.   I am reporting this now because I want to add my 2 cents in for the record.   Haven't seen anything unidentified before or since.  I am a broker for an Investment Company sell stocks, bond, and Mutual funds,etc. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Triangle Aircraft hovering and bright.;2014-08-29 23:00:00;~2 minutes;Triangle Aircraft hovering and bright My girlfriend and I were driving back to her apartment in Liverpool after my cousins wedding on a friday night.  The NY state fair was still going on which I think I saw that someone there saw the same thing as me.  I'm very skeptical on whether people actually see UFO's and such.  Although that night was different.   I saw what at first looked like plane over Onondaga Lake.  Although I then realized the Plane wasn't moving anywhere.  It looked to just hover.  This aircraft then started slowly moving away from the lake and towards our direction in the sky.  It passed from the left side of the street we were on and ended up going to the right. I turned all of my music off and opened my window and heard nothing at all.  If it were an airplane I would have easily heard it.  It wasn't as high up as a plane either.  As it got closer to my vicinity,  It looked like a triangle.  There were bright lights lined up on it from the front to the back, unlike planes that have a bright light and then blinking lights on back wings.   Being so much closer than an actual plane you would think it would be moving fast.  It slowly went across the sky while my girlfriend and I pondered as to what it could be. We questioned everything possible.   This wasn't anything I've seen before.  I bet it was either a government aircraft that no one knows about, or a UFO, even thought I do not want to admit it.
