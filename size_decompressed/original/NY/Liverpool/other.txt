Blinking red green and led white light hovering moving slow and extremely fast when leaving and large.;2014-07-11 22:00:00;>1 hour;blinking red green and led white light hovering moving slow and extremely fast when leaving and large. My friends and I were coming home from a camping trip.  As we were driving, I happened to notice an interesting air craft.  It was blinking red and greenish lights, it had appeared to disappear quite quickly.  For fear of my friends thinking I was crazy I kept it to myself.   As we were pulling into the parking lot of our complexes, it had returned to my sight this time it was close and slow moving.  My friends in the car happened to see it at that point it was quite large bit at this point was shining an led square shaped like light and hovered in one spot for a good min or so.  Later that night, I went to Wegmans with a friend.  As we were driving, I told her about what had just happened, and coincidentaly there it was.   We followed it not about a half an hour we noticed that it was circling around Liverpool.  It would make these sharp right turns that are physically impossible for a human made craft such as a plane.  This experience is extremely life changing and to me it's a blessing to have seen something of this intelegance!  I hope to see this craft again so I can possibly get a picture to share with you!  Stay safe out there! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.1229657534247;-76.1951387475544
