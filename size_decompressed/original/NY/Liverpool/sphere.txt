White shimmering spherical object in western sky just above the horizon after sundown;2013-08-02 21:00:00;1 hour;white shimmering spherical object in western sky just above the horizon after sundown At 9 PM I left my house and started to drive west down my road.  In the still light sky about 5 degrees off of the horizon I saw a blinking white object.  It was not a plane as its trajectory did not change.   I watched it for 3 minutes and it moved laterally to the north about 10 degrees.  I drove through my development and kept seeing it (after the 10n degree move to the north).  It stayed in same position but appeared to 'shimmer' and 'shake .   I took 2 photos of it while the sky was still dark blue. I called my 30 year old son-in-law to look for it. I drove 5 miles to the east to a store, it took 10-15 minutes.   The sky had darkened but the object was still in the same location relative to the horizon & laterally .  I took a few more photos from the store parking lot and a short video.  I then went into the store. I left the store at 10:15 and the object was gone.   While driving home, heading west, I saw 3 large white lights in the southern sky but at the sa! me elevation above the horizon as observed with the object in the western sky. The next day (Saturday 08/03/13) I met with my son-in- law who saw the same white shimmering spherical object on it the western horizon.;43.1229657534247;-76.1951387475544
