Slow moving humming noise over house.;2005-10-22 02:00:00;30 minutes;Slow moving humming noise over house. This is the second time I have experienced this.  The exact date of the previous experience I do not recall.   I woke up early in the morning to a rather loud humming noise (the time listed is approximate).  I walked throughout my house trying to place the source of the sound, but i could not.   After going upstairs i realized that that it was coming from above my house.  I could not obtain a visual of whatever was causing this noise because of cloud cover. This loud, pulsating, humming continued for about 30 minutes.  It faded away slowly over the last 10 minutes or so.  It seemed as though the the source of the noise was hovering in some area above my home and then very slowly moved away.  I would estimate it was moving south. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides only e-address no personal information.  We wonder whether he might have been aural witness to a blimp passing overhead, but a duration of 30 minutes seems to militate against that possibility, it seems to us.
