Shape changing object spinning counter clockwise at 21:17 in central New York;2010-03-07 21:17:00;1 minute;Shape changing object spinning counter clockwise at 21:17 in central New York Came out my front door (facing east) to let my dog out.  I looked straight up above, and noticed a round light formation that was making no noise.  There were about six lights, and they were moving counter clockwise at first and traveling directly north in the sky.  Then the object appeared to start changing shape the lights started moving from edge to center still spinning counter clockwise.  I held my hand up to try to judge the size touching my thumb to my index finger (making an ok jester) the object fit in there (probably the size of a fifty cent piece).  I reached back to open the door and yelled for my wife to come out.  She did, but the lights were already out of her sight, I could still see them, and it made a 90degree turn directly west.  I could no longer see it because trees were obstructing my view.;43.1229657534247;-76.1951387475544
