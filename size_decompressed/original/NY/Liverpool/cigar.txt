Cigar-shaped object with three white lights above LongBranch Elementary School, Liverpool, NY;1987-09-15 07:30:00;1-3 seconds;Cigar-shaped object with three white lights above LongBranch Elementary School, Liverpool, NY I am sorry I cannot be more specific on date or time of the event, as this was when I was attending elementary school (3rd or 4th grade).  Therefore, I have given as many details as I can below that further clarify the information I’ve entered in other fields. Date: Fall of 1987 or 1988 Location: Longbranch Elementary School, Liverpool, central upstate New York Google Maps:  http://goo.gl/maps/Y4Kp  Time:  Morning, between 7 and 8 am EST  Weather: overcast, fairly low cloud   Details: I was on my way into the front doors of my elementary school one morning, just after getting off the bus, when I felt the urgent need to look up.  When I did, I saw a cigar-shaped object (it appeared dark grey, to me) with three, evenly-spaced circular white lights appear in an opening in the clouds.  There was absolutely no sound, so I knew (intuitively) that it wasn’t an airplane.  The object did not appear to move while I was looking at it, and after 1 to 3 seconds, the clouds seemed to close in and cover up the object. As far as I know, there were no other witnesses.  I was facing west as I entered the school, and the object appeared directly above the school. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
