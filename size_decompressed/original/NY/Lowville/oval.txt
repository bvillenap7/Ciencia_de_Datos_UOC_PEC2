Flash of Light;2001-08-16 21:00:00;3 min;Flash of Light Watching stars at night on dock  when suddenly this beam of light from above me, took  me by surprise. It was as bright as a strobe light. Flashed directly into my face. Lasted approximately 20 seconds, then it seemed to , for lack of a better word, return to what appeared to be a transparent object. The UFO traveled in a S-shaped motion forward , moving fast and then slow. Distance to UFO from myself , well, up there where satellites roam. Observed object until treetops blocked my view.
