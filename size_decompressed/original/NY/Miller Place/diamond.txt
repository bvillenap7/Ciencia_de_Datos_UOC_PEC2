Bright white object with flashing red and blue lights seen over Miller Place, New York.;2012-09-05 20:24:00;90 seconds;Bright white object with flashing red and blue lights seen over Miller Place, New York. This evening, at approx. 8:24 PM I had parked my car and was walking back toward the house when I saw a very bright light ib the sky just south of my location.  It was unusually bright and my first impression was that it was a Japanese lantern which consists of a candle and a balloon. As I got closer to the house I realized that it was too high to be as bright an object as the one I was seeing.  It was at that point that the object began moving notherly at a much higher rate of speed.  Previously, it had seemed to be hovering. As it moved north, it seemed to have both red and blue blinking lights on either side of the object.  I lost sight of it over the house and had to run to the backyard to continue viewing.  When I got to the back of the house it was almost out of sight but I could still see all three lights red, blue and brighter white until I lost sight over the treeline.;40.9427;-72.999
