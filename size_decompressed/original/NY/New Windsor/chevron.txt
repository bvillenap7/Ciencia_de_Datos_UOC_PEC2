Date: May 11th 2009 Time: 11:10pm est Place: New Windsor, NY  I was walking into my apartment when I noticed in the sky moving lights that looked kind of like 2 flashlights moving in the sky. As the object came thru the clouds the 2 lights (that would have been on what would be the wings of a airplane) started from the side of the object and came together toward the front of the UFO into one solid beam.  The object looked pretty low, low enough for me to see it also have a pattern of white and red lights in a V formation they were behind the one beam of light facing forward.  The sound it made was a low steady rumble, not a hum but more of a stedy rumble, really low sound but loud enough I could hear it. It moved a very slow pace also.;41.4724000000001;-74.0565999999999
