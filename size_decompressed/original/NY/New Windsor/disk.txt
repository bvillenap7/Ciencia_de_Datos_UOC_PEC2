Wide saucer with square lights large and non moving.;2020-10-24 19:28:00;2-3 minutes;Wide saucer with square lights large and non moving. I was told by a friend said come outside now me my daughter and her friend ran out to see a wide craft with about 10-15 square windows. It was just floating there not moving at all. It was bright like the moon tonight. Then it started fading. I took a picture and with flash on it caught my finger. There were few clouds near the horizon from our point of view but not near the object. From where i was standing i would say it was towards maybrook ny. It just faded away no noise no smoke nothing. To my left i could see a plane leaving a smoke trail. But this object there is no explanation i am as big of a skeptic as one can be and always think people do these reports for attention but i have never seen anything like this ever.  I would think someone was a crack pot for saying what we saw tonight but i still cannot explain it.;41.4724000000001;-74.0565999999999
