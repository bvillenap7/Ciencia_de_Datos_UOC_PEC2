I noticed a dim light moving toward a known constellation. At first I thought it was a satellite (non blinking light just moving across the sky). I pointed it out to my girlfriend. As soon as she saw it it grew in size and brightness (brighter than Sirius on magnitude scale) and continued to move across the sky southeast. It remianed lit for approx. 5 seconds then dimmed back out and moved for another couple of seconds and then disappeared.;41.5638;-73.7952999999999
