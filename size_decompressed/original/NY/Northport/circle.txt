I have 5 photos of three unexplained single separate small lights in my yard that faces woods.   There was alot of unexplained, and never seen before, light, and an unusually long sunset.    I walked my dog an hour later after sundown and saw a round silent yellow orb about 7 feet wide glide gracefully and somewhat slowly across the distance near the woods where the small lights were earlier.    I have never in my long life seen anything like it.;40.9058;-73.3381
