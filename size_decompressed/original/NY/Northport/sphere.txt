They flash very bright white light, like the flash cubes from the old cameras.  The flash is bright and then fades like a strobe light.  It is irregular in rate, sometimes once and then two or three in a row. The first night I saw the object it landed in the woods behind my house.  I woke up my wife and then she saw it with me as it left.  Then about 2 nights later, around the same time, we again witnessed about 2 of these flying, flashing white lights at different locations in the tree line of the woods.  We tried to video tape them but it just came out dark.  The tape sounds like the Blair Witch Project.  I saw it one more time in the beginning of this month, September 2008, in the yard again next to my pool again around 3 am.;40.9058;-73.3381
