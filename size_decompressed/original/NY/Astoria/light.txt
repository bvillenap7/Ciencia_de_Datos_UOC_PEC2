At one time tow of the ufo's  intertwined like a braid-- i'm sorry if this message is spacey and scadered  but i'm a little freaked out right now ------i just know a plane couldn't have done what i saw i don't know what they mean by the background of the observer  but-- i'm a 23 year old dancer;40.76425;-73.93075
