2 objects in the Sky- Sunday, August 1st, 2004;2004-08-01 02:00:00;4:00 Hours;2 objects in the Sky- Sunday, August 1st, 2004 At around 2:00 AM on Sunday, August 1st, 2004 - I saw on the porch of my apt. in Astoria in the sky 2 white objects - you could tell that one was follwing the other.   It was slightly hazing out so they were easy to spot since they were so bright and the haze illumniated them.  Then on saw several helocopters behind them but there was no sound from the helocopters.  I had my binoculars with me so I could clearly identify the helocopters.  At around 3:15 I heard a ring, tone, dog whistle like sound and I looked up and I saw an object moving.  When I spoted it it look like it started to slow down the stop.  It felt sort of like I see you, see me, see you - then it just left and kept on moving out of sight.  Then in a half-hour it came back and did it again.  I could see the traffic pattern of the airport near us - these objects were no where near any flight plan I've ever see.  If anyone knows what this means, please email me at ((e-mail address deleted)).  And I don't any clowns asking me what it means.  I'm in a tree - serious emails please.  And I told you I still hear that ringing every night, and I get up and know that something is there.  That's it.  --sincerely ((name deleted))--;40.76425;-73.93075
