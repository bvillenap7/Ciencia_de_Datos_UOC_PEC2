Wingless airplane torso in the night sky close to LaGuardia airport.;2011-06-14 22:25:00;15 seconds;Wingless airplane torso in the night sky close to LaGuardia airport. I was outside my apt. building looking at the moon and thinking about the moonâ€™s light shining through the clouds, when at  22:25 eastern time, I heard a mix between a loud engine and a whizzing sound coming from behind my 3 floor building.   When I saw it , the first thing I noticed was that the aircraft was flying a lot lower than a commercial airplane normally did.   As I began observing it thoroughly, I noticed its tail had very bright white and red lights going off.  The red light was going off at one second intervals with the white in between.   I assumed it was a government aircraft like Air Force One because the tail  lights were very powerful.  The second thing I noticed was that this mysterious aircraft did not have lights on the wings.  My initial assumption was that it was a commercial plane flying lower than usual.    I began searching for wings on the aircraft to no avail.  The aircraft flew in on a 90 degree angle which I thought was weird because I thought all commercial aircrafts could only fly at a 45 degree angle or at a certain angle while this aircraft was flying in a horizontal line.   The aircraft flew, from what I could measure with my arms, in a 40 degree angle in 10 seconds.  It flew through the lowest cloud formation I could see and the lights were so powerful I could still see it throught the cloud formation.  Seconds after the aircraft disappeared I saw a reflection in a window of a bright red light on the opposite building in front of me as if to say the light was comimng from behind my building.  As I looked behind my building I saw nothing.  I still heard the aircraft about 3 seconds after it disappeared from my sight.  I went back into the building.  About 10 min later I stepped outside and called the National UFO Reporting Hotline and realized the sky was completely clear. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded and credible.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD));40.76425;-73.93075
