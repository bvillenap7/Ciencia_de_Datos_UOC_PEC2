The object moved very slowly to the west and was intermittently obscured by clouds.  It seemed to glow with changing intensity. I was able to take video of the event and point it out to several passersby while observing it.  When I reviewed the video, I noticed a second craft to the right of the one I had been observing and had missed while watching initially.  I've submitted screen shots of the video to this site.  I'll be submitting the video once I can clip it and make it shorter for email submission.;40.76425;-73.93075
