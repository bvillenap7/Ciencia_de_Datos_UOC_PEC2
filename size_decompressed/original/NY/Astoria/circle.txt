UFO over Manhattan;2002-09-07 15:00:00;about 30 min;UFO over Manhattan I was sitting on my back porch looking up at a blimp against a beautiful blue cloudless sky when a star caught my eye.   I've never seen a star or planet in the daytime so after watching for a few minutes I went inside to grab my camera.   This took a few minutes to find camera, batteries etc.... but when I came back out it was still there.   I took eight pictures with my digital camera.  I watched for a few more minutes and came inside to load and enlarge on my computer.   Needless to say the enlargements are fuzzy, but there is a shape to it.   I went back outside and it was gone.   This happened at 3pm edt, it's now 6:30 and I'm still searching the sky for this object, to no avail.    I have the pictures if someone can enhance them I'd be happy to send you them.
