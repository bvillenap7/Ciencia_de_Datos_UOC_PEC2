Fiery orange dual globe flies over Astoria, NY.;2014-08-17 23:53:00;1 minute;Fiery orange dual globe flies over Astoria NY I was on the phone with a friend of mine at 11:53 pm and saw a bright orange light in the sky.  Initially I ignored it since I'm used to helicopters in the area all of the time.  But after awhile, the bright light became more pronounced the closer it got.   I got curious and then went out on my balcony to get a better look.  When I finally got a good look at it as it flew to the left of my building, I realized it was something I have never seen before.   It looked like two orange fiery globes that had been fused in the middle and occasionally sparks of orange light would drop from the bottom of it.   I would estimate that it was approximately twice the size of a helicopter but perhaps larger.  It made absolutely no sound.  This is the first time I have ever seen something that I couldn't explain.  Not sure if i'll ever see it again but I have my camera ready this time in case it does.;40.76425;-73.93075
