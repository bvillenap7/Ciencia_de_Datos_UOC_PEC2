Very bright light to the west;2018-05-20 00:12:00;15 minutes;Very bright light to the west Out to the west side of the house there was a very bright light showing in the distance through the woods.  It hovered as if it was spotlighting something.  It made me wonder if it was some kind of helicopter that was using a spotlight.   I got out the binoculars but had a hard time seeing fully with the leaves just coming out on the trees.  All I could see is that it was very very bright and moving very succinctly.   Woke up my husband and he caught a brief glimpse before it disappeared.  We do have helicopters that fly by here regularly but I opened the window -- there was no engine noise like there would have been for something like that or even an airplane.   All I can say is, it was attention getting as it is not the normal lights seen around here.  Been an hour now and no bight light...   I'm submitting report in case others do as well.;42.9089;-78.0288
