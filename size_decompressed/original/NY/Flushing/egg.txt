I WAS WALKING MY FRIEND'S HOME AND WE HEARD THIS HUMMING NOISE FROM ABOVE US! WE ALL LOOKED UP AND SAW THESE EGG SHAPED FLYING SHIP'S FLOATING ABOUT 60 FEET ABOVE! THEY WERE TURNING AROUND VERY FAST THEN THEY SHOT OFF INTO THE NIGHT SKY! ME AND MY FRIEND'S JUST LOOKED AT EACH OTHER! WE DIDN'T TELL ANYONE BECAUSE THEY'D THINK WE WERE CRAZY! BUT I KNOW WHAT WE SAW WAS VERY REAL! I HOPE I NEVER SEE IT AGAIN, IT SCARED THE HELL OUT OF US!!;40.7508805594405;-73.8237998601394
