Shifting circle within the sphere, like an eye.. Orange orb of light floated through my backyard, within 10-15 feet of me. It was basketball-sized & bioluminescent, like a jellyfish. Within the sphere (whose size remained constant, there was another circle that would shift, expanding and contracting. like the pupil of an eye. it seemed to be looking around, and it looked at me. i managed to grab my ipad to film, but as soon as i started moving, it zipped up over my neighbors roof & hovered there. Before that, it had been drifting, slowly, so I lowered the camera for a moment to see if it would come back. It didn't, but as soon as i snapped the camera but up, it zips off to the left. The clip is here https://youtu.be/_5Oeauv_xC0 Sorry i didn't get a video while it was closer. I was in shock for a few moments, but nothing supernaturally induced or anything like that. I've just never seen anything like it.;40.7508805594405;-73.8237998601394
