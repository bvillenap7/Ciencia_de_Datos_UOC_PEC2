bright lights  in NY sky;2005-08-04 01:30:00;31/2 HRS;bright lights  in NY sky I still have goosebumps.   At about 1:30 a.m i was looking out my window in the north east direction, and I noticed a really bright star in the sky.  It was white and red , flashing , and there seemed to be like a spotlight coming down from it.  The sky around it also seemed to be illuminated.   I thought maybe its a planet but it was moving way too fast.  It would move left to right, up and down and it would get brighter and dimmer at times.   A commercial plane went by at one point and the light just faded into the sky.  It blended in with the other stars, that's how far away it appeared.   Then about 2 minutes later it was back, and this time there was another light in the distance.  For the next 3.5 hours these 2 lights moved around the sky in speeds that were out of this world. I can't believe it.  Did any one else report these lights in the NY, CT area.;40.7508805594405;-73.8237998601394
