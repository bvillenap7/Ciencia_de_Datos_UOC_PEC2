I was approximately 15 miles from Manhattan. I can't guess from the photos how far the object was positioned from where I took the photo. I believe it may be more than 10 miles which would lead me to believe it was a very large object.  It appeared to be moving slowly across the sky.  I took two photos 3 minutes apart.  I believe the speed could be determined by the relation of the object to the rooftops of buildings and the time between shots.;40.7508805594405;-73.8237998601394
Two crafts moving over Flushing, NY;2008-09-19 11:00:00;30 seconds;Two crafts moving over Flushing, NY My account is as follows:  I was on my bicycle about 11 am in downtown Flushing, NY returning from some errands.  As I turned off Main Street, I noticed a bright flash in the sky to the north.  I turned my head to the left and saw the sun glint off of something in the sky.  It had to have been highly polished and metallic.  I live in an area where I see all kinds of crafts: jetliners, blimps, private planes, I even saw fighter jets over my house after “9/11”.  This looked different, very different.  I didn’t turn my head back and proceed on my way.  I actually pulled over to the curb and stared.  What I saw were two objects.  They were close enough that I was to be able to discern certain features but far enough away not to be able to be precise about the features.  They were moving in tandem at about 200 mph (the same speed of an airline on approach that I typically see at Laguardia Airport and were under the low hanging clouds, which I estimate were at 2,000 feet or so.  One was larger and appeared to caplet-shaped.  The other was smaller and followed the first.  It was spherical but not perfectly round.  What was dramatic about this was that they were incredibly close to one another, as closer as fighter jets from a squadron that fly in formation.  At first, I thought the larger was towing the smaller but then I dismissed that thought.  Then I observed that there is no way that air traffic in the NYC metropolitan area would be allowed to fly so close to another craft. They flew in a perfectly straight line but never did the distance or perspective between the two change.  I observed this for a good 30 seconds as they moved off and away.  As I biked off I had to analyze what I saw and decide whether, in fact, they were UFOs or not.  What convinced me that I believe they were is the fact that no noise emanated from them and I don’t recall seeing any wings on these crafts.;40.7508805594405;-73.8237998601394
