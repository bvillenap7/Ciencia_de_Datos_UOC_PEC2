I sat on my porch and observed the scattered fireworks crackle in the sky.  However, unlike the expected movement of light with any firework (a ball of light going up, reaction/crackle in the sky, slowly trickles down) I saw something that moved very differently.  What I saw was a small red or orange circle going up in the sky at a 45° angle (or at a slope) extremely fast.  Mind you this sighting was a few seconds, but as this ball of light continued to travel it suddenly stops and a flash of light appears or opens up in the sky.  As the flash of light was about to close or disappear the light (or ball of light I don’t know at this point) continued its straight path and also disappears.  There was no sound, just a visual, and again this was a few seconds.  The closest thing I can use as an example would be a reference to the light speed scene in Star Wars The Last Jedi - Holdos Sacrifice.;40.7508805594405;-73.8237998601394
