Floating object above New York City. Witnessed by my daughter and I.;2008-03-30 14:00:00;20 seconds;Floating object above New York City.  Witnessed by my daughter and I. 12/23/2008   I'm sorry it  took long to report this. I would say this happened early  2008 around the afternoon hours. I just happen to find this site while watching a  National Geographic channel on UFO sightings. It was being narrated by the late Peter Jennings. I live in a 15 story building in which I'm located on the 5th floor. We happen to have a great view of the New York City skyline. This was an overcast day but the view was clear for miles. One could see the skyline quite clearly from where we are some 5-10 miles from the city. My daughter, who was playing with her dolls near by yelled out to me to look out the window. I in the mean time was on the computer finishing up some papers, when I turn to look out and we see this oblong shaped object some 3-4 miles away. It's difficult to discern exactly the distance because all this lasted some 15-20 seconds. But as we looked outside, this object floated some 600 feet/plus from the ground, just  hovering when it began to move upward slowly and then disappear. The shape was obelisk with some sort of protrusions sticking out from the side in a horizontal  form.  It was dark black.  I would guess the object was rather large. Roughly  some 70-100 feet long vertically. It made no sound. Wasn't a helicopter, or  blimp that just happened to stand on it's end. It was very weird. This is something I will never forget. The odd thing of course is that no one that I know or I don't know reported this except my daughter and myself. My daughter is 5 years old.  This is a big city and for this  to happen here is just damn crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date.

Three orange aircrafts, one a cylinder, moving in a rotating motion.;2014-02-08 21:30:00;<4 minutes;Three orange aircrafts, one a cylinder, moving in a rotating motion My family and I were watching TV, when we saw three orange aircrafts out our window.  I first saw a huge cylinder shaped carrier looking as if it were coming toward us.  It had two orange lights at the ends of it.  It then slowly descended in a different direction moving in rotating motion.  The two orange air crafts followed it.;40.7508805594405;-73.8237998601394
