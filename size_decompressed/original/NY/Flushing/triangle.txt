Triangle shaped object with red lights in New York;2007-12-21 22:00:00;1 minute;Triangle shaped object with red lights in New York My name is ((name deleted)) and I am a ((twenties)) year old nursing student from North Carolina. I was a skeptic of UFOâ€™s and extra terrestrials for a long time.  Then around 10 pm on December 21 2007 I saw something and experienced something that would change my beliefs forever.  I was sitting on my couch talking to my boyfriend and petting my cat when the hair on the back of my neck stood up and my cat suddenly flipped out. Then something suddenly told me to look up and out the window. I looked and I saw a large triangle shaped object with red lights on it.  I saw it for what seemed like only a few seconds and then it disappeared right in front of my eyes as if it had disappeared into another dimension.   The red lights around the object where bright but the big red light in the center was as bright as a star. It was unlike anything I have ever seen and I know that it was not of this world.  I told my boyfriend who is a big UFO believer what had happened and what I had felt.  He knew that I did not know anything about UFO sightings and he said I described exactly what others had felt.  I am now a believer and I am convinced that what I saw was a UFO.  I some how felt that they wanted me to see them because they knew I was such a skeptic.  I will remember that sight and exactly how it looked for the rest of my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));40.7508805594405;-73.8237998601394
