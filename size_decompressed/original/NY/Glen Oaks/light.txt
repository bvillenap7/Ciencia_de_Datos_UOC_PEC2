Red pulsating orb low in sky over LIE;2021-04-19 22:00:00;2 minutes;Red pulsating orb low in sky over LIE I was westbound on the LIE heading towards Manhattan and saw a bright red orb pulsating as it was slowly floating over my car heading eastbound.  I did notice the orb wasn't high up in the sky like the planes, seeing I was right by LaGuardia Airport.  The orb was just floating maybe 30 ft above the treeline.;40.7493;-73.7151
