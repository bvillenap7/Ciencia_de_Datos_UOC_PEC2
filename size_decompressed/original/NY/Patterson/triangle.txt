As we approached, we lost sight behing the trees and buildings.  We then turn right onto 292.  2-3 minutes later we see just past Mooney Hill road we see the same lights in a triangle hovering a few hundred feet over tue trees, remaining in one spot.   It was raining pretty decently at the time but the object was far below the clouds.  After continuing down 292 for another minute, we lost sight of the object behind a mountain.;41.4826;-73.5824
