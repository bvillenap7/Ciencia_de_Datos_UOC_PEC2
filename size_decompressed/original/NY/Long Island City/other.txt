Many moving star balls;2001-12-29 00:00:00;5 minutes;Many moving star balls I sent a report a few days after the incident but I'm not sure if I did it right , so here it is again.  My family and I had gone out for my birthday that evening.  It was a beautiful night with a full moon.  The restaurant door opens on a corner so it made it so condusive to looking up to the moon.It looked like the sky was full of stars but then they started to move.  I don't mean like a shooting star, it was like each one had a mind of its own.  They each moved in their own direction, then about 5 lined up straight then took off in opposite directions, some looked like they were playing tag, it was wild.  None of us could believe what we were seeing.  The star balls were doing this for so long that I ran back into the restaurant and called the people who were inside to look at what was going on.  Everyone ran outside and were freaking out.  I'll never forget that sky.;40.7469705882353;-73.946044117647
Darting lights over NYC on 12/29/01;2001-12-29 23:59:00;10 minutes maybe a little;Darting lights over NYC on 12/29/01 On 12/29/01 into 12/30/01 about midnight the moon was very bright.  It just happened that the restaurant we were leaving faced the moon perfectly.  We all stopped to look at the moon & stars.  There were about 8 of us looking at it when what we thought were stars ,what we were looking at started to dart and shoot all over the sky.  There were so many!.  Some lined up in order and then just went off in their own direction. just to zip back nd forth. Others looked like they were playing a game of cat & mouse.  They were darting all over the sky for the longest.  It was so strange that I ran back into the restaurant and called the people inside out to see it.  We were all in shock and disblief..;40.7469705882353;-73.946044117647
