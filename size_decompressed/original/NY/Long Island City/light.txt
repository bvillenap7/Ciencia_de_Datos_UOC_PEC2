Fast bright turquoise light moving towards the ground.;2013-05-27 00:10:00;1 second;Fast bright turquoise light moving towards the ground I was driving slowly in Long Island City, NY, searching for a parking spot, when I saw a bright turquoise light (like a shooting star, without trail) in the sky heading down on a 30 degree angle at a very high speed.  It disappeared about 1 second after I noticed it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.7469705882353;-73.946044117647
