Mothership and smaller craft?;2014-06-15 14:30:00;10 minutes;Mothership and smaller craft? I was coming home from grocery shopping and had my sun glasses on, but noticed a few really bright lights in the sky when I looked up.  There was one large silver circular shape surrounded by a few smaller ones (I am not sure how many, as a few of them spread apart from it, while a couple stayed).   I  kept looking back up to see if it could possibly be a few planes near each other, or maybe a blimp, but the large one stayed in the same spot and more of the smaller ones spread out and vanished.  When I reached my street about 10 minutes later, the larger one moved to the right, then back to the left and flew off faster and vanished.;40.7469705882353;-73.946044117647
