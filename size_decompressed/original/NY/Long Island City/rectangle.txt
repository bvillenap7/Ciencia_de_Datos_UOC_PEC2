Then I noticed that the crane was not lifting it at all but the object was in the background.  I asked my co-worker what the hell is that it started to move slowly.  We also noticed the construction workers on the building next door pointing and watching the same object.  Several other coworkers also came by the object moved across Manhattan from East to West around 59th Street then traveled South then re appeared in front of us again on the N side of the building.  We called co workers in our office in NYC they saw it too and couldn't make out what it was they discribed it as a large black box.;40.7469705882353;-73.946044117647
