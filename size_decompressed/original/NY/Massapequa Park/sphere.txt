Flying orbs over the night sky in New York on July 28, 2012.;2012-07-28 22:00:00;15 minutes;Flying orbs over the night sky in New York on July 28, 2012. My wife and I filmed this sighting on 7-28-12 around 10 p.m. from Long Island, NY. I wish I had the footage I took with my iPhone of the first set of 6 or so as they were more acrobatic (accidently deleted during sync), but I did take video from my camcorder too that still captures the essence of what we witnessed that evening.  Hard to explain, but intriguing enough that I thought it was worth reporting. I ended it abruptly after the last one jetted away and the sky went dark again.  Each disappeared the same way - they shook violently then seemed to just disappear.  These balls rose relatively quickly, I'd guess them to reach speeds of 150-200 mph as they ascended.  But then they would just stop, and sit, and hover for a while.  As I zoomed in, I saw that before they disappeared, they shook erratically and became hard to keep a steady view of.   At the end of my clip you'll see a great illustration of what I mean - a great close up of this illuminated orb..  These balls apeared to pulsate and seemed to almost make patterns, such as triangles and lines.;40.68;-73.4425

If I were to take a guess I would say the object was traveling at around 30 miles per hour.  After viewing the object for about 30 seconds, another object of the same shape and size was viewed, it followed the same trajectory as the first object.  Inside the sphere looked what seemed to be like a glowing torch.   This was not a balloon, it had a constant speed and was traveling at a constant straight line trajectory maintaining constant height.   There was no sound coming from the objects.   Both objects disappeared out of sight after about 2 minutes.;40.68;-73.4425
