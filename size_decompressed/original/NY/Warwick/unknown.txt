Four blinking lights hovering without making a sound for at least 3 minutes in Orange County, NY;2021-05-18 04:00:00;2:00;Four blinking lights hovering without making a sound for at least 3 minutes in Orange County, NY I was on my way to work on 5/18/21 at 0400 in Warwick, NY. I saw an unknown object in the sky with blinking lights that was flying extremely slow and appeared lower in the sky than an airplane would be. I couldn’t make out a shape of the object but it was slowly moving west of me than it came slightly back towards me traveling eastbound. It then went south with about four lights blinking from front to back. I pulled over and recorded it on my phone for 1:38. I turned my car off as I was recording to see if I could hear anything and it didn’t make a sound. This is the third time in less than a year that I have seen an object in the sky and they were all in the same place at roughly the same time, between 4:00-4:40am. The first sighting was 7/24/20 at 4:36 am and the second was 5/7/21 at 4:34. I have still photos of the first two sightings but they are blurry and of poor quality. The location of the sightings is Bellvale Rd between Sugar Loaf Mountain Rd & Kin! gs Highway bypass in Warwick, Orange County, NY.;41.2668774193549;-74.3600795698923
