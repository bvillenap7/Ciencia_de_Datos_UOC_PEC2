Flame- like light moving across sky at helicopter speed but making no sound;2010-08-28 23:30:00;30 seconds;Flame- like light moving across sky at helicopter speed but making no sound We had earlier seen a strange 7 light changing formation and then as we left our friends' house 3 hours later we couldn't believe it when there was a red light going across the sky. To be precise it was more of a flame with red, orange and yellow just like a flame, flickering but not going out. We at first thought it might be a helicopter but it made no sound and moved at the speed of a helicopter, but not like any that we have ever seen. We have never seen any odd things in the night sky so tonight has been disturbing. It moved out of sight behind trees.;41.0127;-73.8457
