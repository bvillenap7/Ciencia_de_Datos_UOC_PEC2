seven lights in formation rotate and change formation to resemble the Big Dipper;2010-08-28 20:30:00;1 minute;seven lights in formation rotate and change formation to resemble the Big Dipper My husband  and I observed seven separate lights in an almost symmetrical formation but then the lights began to rotate and to me it appeared that the lights almost took the form of the constellation Ursa Minor or Major.  Then the lights began to fade and disappear one by one.  We were headed to our friends house a few blocks away and as we turned the corner there was a car stopped in the road with the doors open.  Three teens were outside and were on a cell phone and I could hear the driver telling her mother that she really did see something.   At that point I rolled down my window and asked if they had seen the lights too and they excitedly said they saw the lights and that there were seven of them.;41.0127;-73.8457
