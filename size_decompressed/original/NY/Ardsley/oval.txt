Then the lights reappeared and moved in the same manor and then disappeared again and didn’t return.  Each event lasted just over 1 minute. Within 2-3 minutes after the 2nd sighting I saw what appeared to be helicopter lights moving across the sky at the same location and altitude of the sightings. There were many neighbors also  watching this, some stopped their cars to get out to take pictures with their cell phones. I’m sure there are videos out there of the occurrence. I would estimate hundreds of people witnessed this event, since on my street alone over 12 people watched the lights with me.;41.0127;-73.8457
