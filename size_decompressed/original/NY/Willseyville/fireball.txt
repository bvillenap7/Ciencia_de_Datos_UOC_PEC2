Star like objects all night;2020-07-31 01:00:00;Hours;Star like objects all night Many nights for the past year there’s “star” like lights in the sky but they move and will follow me.  When looking at them threw binoculars they appear as a ball of energy.  Some nights there’s 3.   Some nights there’s 50 or more.  They will dim and/or brighten there lights to appear to be stars.  Also there are groups all together with no lights.  These ones can only be seen threw binoculars or some magnification.   Most times where I can notice one there’s 2 more with it.  Use binoculars, or scope and the difference between a star and these is obvious.;42.3029;-76.3897
