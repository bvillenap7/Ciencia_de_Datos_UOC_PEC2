Seemed to travel back and forth While traveling north on the New York State Thruway from Kingston to Saugerties I observed a bright light directly in front of me that at first appeared to be a star.  Upon  coming closer to the object I noticed that it was two bright and close to be a star.  Further viewing showed what appeared to be a pink/red aura coming from the top of the object but having a bright almost white light surrounding it. I noticed the object seemed to appear further ahead(grow smaller) and then appear closer to my posistion(become larger).  I passed under the object and looked up and saw what appeared to be a very dark circle which seemed to make up the body of the object. I noticed other cars swerve infront me as the drivers tried to better view the object as well.  No sound was observed coming from the craft as would normally be the case with small planes and helicopters.;41.969001111111;-74.0671094444442

Right at the center of the bridge was a hovering object making no noise.  As we approach it we realize its round with three points and its spinning.  It has 1 white light with red, blue and yellow lights.  As we pass it my husband looks right up at it and says it rotating.  As we got to the end of the bridge I turned around and saw it shoot off to the south about 1/2 mile so fast the lights left a blur.  Then it took off down the Hudson river so fast I have never seen anything like it.;41.969001111111;-74.0671094444442
White flaming orb going south over Kingston.;2013-04-14 00:00:00;10 seconds;White flaming orb going south over Kingston. I was watching the sky marveling at the stars, when a white orb with a flickering white flame zoomed past overhead going south.   It was at 1000 ft.- 5000 ft. & was not a contemporary aircraft it had no contrail nor tail so it was not an asteroid.   I suppose it was a military drone.   Were such aircraft in the area, or are such aircraft stationed in the area??   It was probably going 200 mph - 400 mph. in vicinity of Hurley Ave.over the woods.;41.969001111111;-74.0671094444442
