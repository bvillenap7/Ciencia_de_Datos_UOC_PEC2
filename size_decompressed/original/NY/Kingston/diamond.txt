New sightings in the Hudson Valley, NY.;2008-05-09 03:25:00;25 minutes or so;New sightings in the Hudson Valley, NY. We were heading towards Saugerties, NY at approx. 3:25 am and I was the first to notice a very bright set of lights in the sky back towards the Kingston area.  At first, I thought it was just a plane.  It was much to bright and was stationary to be a plane.  My friend who was driving noticed it to and decided to get closer to it.   This is where it gets wierder.  We got very close to it.  My friend drove his car down into a dead-end drive and the object came straight at us.  He then turned off his headlights and got out of the car coaxing me to go with to get a better view. As soon at the lights went off, you could see a beam of light heading for my friend who was already 10 feet in front of the car. He dodged the beam as I ran out of the car. We proceeded down the drive about 20 feet, noticing that the object took a sharp right turn. We ran back to the car trying to chase it further, but to our amazement there was no sign of the rather large craft. It dissappeared within seconds of us getting back in my friends turbo-charged car(so it only took about 10 seconds to get back on the road and head after the thing in the sky). The object made no sound and had no propeller on top so this was not a helicopter. This was not a plane and its landing gear. I cannot explain what this was, only that I have spent the better part of my young life studying this phenomena and I have never witnessed something like that in real life. I was terrified and I felt very strange afterward. A feeling I cannot describe. This is the Hudson Valley though and I have been told this sort of stuff has been going on for years.;41.969001111111;-74.0671094444442
