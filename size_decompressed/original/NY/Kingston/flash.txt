White Flash near Exit 19 Thruway Kingston;2006-11-27 23:00:00;1 second;White Flash near Exit 19 Thruway Kingston While driving south on the NY Thruway we observed a sudden flash in the sky to our left at the entry point of exit 19. It was as if somebody had taken a picture from about 500 feet in the air. It was very bright and both myself and my 16 year old son observed it immediately asking each other  Did you see that?  simultaneously. It did not happen again though we were looking for it through the windows and moonroof. The sky was clear and we were both lucid, having just stopped for coffee. I just filed the report as I had not been on the site for a while and saw a sighting out of Albany on 11/28. We were returning from a Hockey Tournament in Canada and I just checked the date of our return, finding it was 11/27.  I am not exactly certain of the time, I would say between 10pm and 1am.;41.969001111111;-74.0671094444442
