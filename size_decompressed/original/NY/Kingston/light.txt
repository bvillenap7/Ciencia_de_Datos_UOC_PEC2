Bright light moving quickly before blinking out of existence.;2006-07-17 00:00:00;.5 seconds;Bright light moving quickly before blinking out of existence. I looked to my left (east) and high in the sky moving quickly to the north was a very bright light.  I saw it move extremely fast northbound before it turned back on itself on the same plane, just for a tenth of a second, then stopped and blinked out of existence.  As it disappeared it brightened up before looking like it collapsed instantaneously in on itself into a horizontal line of light.  Working as a lighting tech on movies, I know how different lights appear under different conditions and optical circumstances. ((NUFORC Note:  Under ordinary circumstances, we would explore whether the witness might have observed the flare of an Iridium satellite.  However, satellites do not reverse their course.

Ball of light moves slowly behind a tree & disappears.;2007-10-16 15:00:00;3 secs.;Ball of light moves slowly behind a tree & disappears. It was 3:00 PM and was a clear, bright day.   I was riding with my mother and I looked out the passenger seat window and saw a ball of light moving slowly in the sky. It looked slightly larger than a planet or large star would look.  We were briefly stopped in traffic when I saw it, and it moved behind a tree, and we started moving again right then, but it had disappeared.  There was no trail of smoke and it did not look like a plane or other known aircraft.;41.969001111111;-74.0671094444442

It changed colors slightly as it was descending from an orange to green to a white/yellow. Was dropping fast and was very bright, not faint or hard to see at all. Could this have been a meteor or something else?;41.969001111111;-74.0671094444442
Two Lights seen over Hudson River in Kingston, NY on 32 South.;2012-12-07 21:25:00;5 minutes;Two Lights seen over Hudson River in Kingston, NY on 32 South Was coming home from work in Rhinebeck. Crossed Kingston/Rhineclif Bridge and turned south onto 32/Flatbush Rd.  Noticed two lights slightly to my left through front windshield but dismissed them as stars or possibly small planes.  Was listening to music and thinking. As I passed a the Rondout Services center on the left I glanced up and noticed the lights were still there but brighter.  They were also a reddish color.  I also noticed that they were below the cloud cover because it was thin and fuzzy stars could be seen through them.   These lights were very bright and not hazy in the same way. I still thought they were planes or helicopters, but noticed that they didn't seem to be moving.  But since I was in motion I couldn't tell.   I continued to watch them and it became very clear quickly that they were stationary in the sky because, as I continued they seemed to be getting closer and the angle between them and my view was changing.  I was approaching a perpendicular angle to them and I noticed they were quite a bit lower and closer than I originally had thought.  By the time I got to the stoplight at the waste management station they were right in the frame of the driver's side window.  It's a lengthy light, so I took the time to roll down the window and stick my head out to really get a good look.  At that point they were right in front of my line of view out the window.  One appeared to be about 40 degrees up from the horizon (there's a rise to the left, then the Hudson River, which is about a mile away from that point) and the other was higher, to the left, at ! about 60 degrees.  I glanced at the car next to me (I was in the left hand lane), and at least the driver of that vehicle had also noticed the lights and was clearly looking at them.  Our eyes met briefly in recognition of what we were seeing.  He was also speaking to someone, but whether it was to a passenger--couldn't see into his vehicle--or into a speaker phone I couldn't tell. When I stopped and actually really looked at the lights, they were clearly stationary, very bright, steady reddish lights, very shiny.  All of a sudden, on cue, as it were, and right before the stop light turned (it almost seemed timed), the two lights very rapidly and in perfect tandem and coordination, veered at right angles to the left.  They went from stationary to rapid motion literally at once. I remember thinking...ok, this is just too weird, it's just how it's supposed to be, why couldn't it have been something else.  I drove on through the light and a little ways down the road was able to look back briefly to see if I could tell where they were heading, and I couldn't see them again. I don't know if they speeded up and disappeared or what, but they were gone. When I got home my partner and I plotted the sighting on a topographical map of Ulster county that we have on the wall.  Based on that, and depending on their elevation, we figured out that the lights either had to be over the Hudson itself, or close to being over S. Rhinebeck.  I don't know if anyone else saw anything, but I know at least one other driver did.;41.969001111111;-74.0671094444442
Kingston,  NY Two brilliant red stationary lights accelerate quickly in coordinated fashion and disappear.;2013-12-06 22:30:00;5 minutes;Kingston,  NY Two brilliant red stationary lights accelerate quickly in coordinated fashion and disappear Coming home from work south on Highway 32, just south of Kingston Bridge.  Two very brilliant red lights, below cloud cover, seemed to be hovering over the land fill to my left.  They were stationary because as I continued north to the stoplight that leads to the entrance of the land fill, I was getting closer to them and the angle changed. When I stopped at the stoplight they were pretty close, still brilliant red, no blinking--one was higher than the other at about a 45 degree angle.  I noticed that the driver in the vehicle to my right (I was in left lane) was looking at them too.  Before our light turned green the two lights suddenly and in completely coordinated fashion, accelerated quickly to the north and disappeared.  I've been living in this area for some time and am familiar with the various helicopters and small planes that frequent the area.  (There is a small private airport about five miles south of where the sighting occurred).  I've never seen any! thing quite like this before.;41.969001111111;-74.0671094444442
