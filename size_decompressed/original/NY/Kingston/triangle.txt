1983 Hudson Valley UFO sighting;1983-11-01 21:00:00;about 15 min;1983 Hudson Valley UFO sighting Dear UFO Center:   I am writing this to report a UFO sighting my family and I had in approximately November of 1983 when I was an 8-year-old child.  (I am 36 now.)  I was only recently reminded of this event because I had listened to a brief clip of a past episode of the radio show Coast to Coast AM regarding the Hudson Valley UFO sightings of the early-mid 1980s, and wanted to add my recollection to your database. One evening around November of 1983, my family and I were on our way home from dinner at a local restaurant. If I remember correctly, it was about 9:00 at night.  As we pulled into our driveway, we noticed what appeared to be a triangular-shaped craft of some sort slowly traveling north along the path of the Hudson River.  (This would be about 1 mile north of the Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge.)  The craft appeared to be 4 or 5 separate white lights arranged in a triangular pattern, and flew perhaps 500-1000 feet over our house.  It was moving about the speed of a small prop airplane (if I had to guess I'd say maybe 80 or 90 mph.)  If you were to extend your arms above you with your two hands spread towards the sky, that would be about the area this craft covered above us. What was strange, however, was that every so often one or two of the lights would switch positions in the arrangement, so I believe this was not one whole craft but 4 or 5 separate ones, because I also could see no structure directly between them.  If I remember correctly as well, these lights slowly turned around as one unit and began heading south for about 5 minutes, then turned due north again. I do not remember them making a sound or doing any other strange motions, and they just continued on, slowly heading north of our position. Around the same period, I vaguely remember hearing that there were a team of hangliders or ultra-lites copycating the rash of sightings in that area, (perhaps to cash in on the notoriety), so I am not really sure if my sighting was one of these alleged copycat teams or a real unidentified flying object.  The thing that made us believe it was not hangliders or ultra-lites was because we did not hear any engine sounds that would normally be associated with them. Thank you for your consideration.

Kingston, NY Sighting;1994-09-15 20:00:00;10 mins;Kingston, NY Sighting This event occurred at approx. 8 PM in the month of Sept/1994 on Delaware Ave, Kingston, NY where I lived at this time. I was called outside by one of our kids who ran in and said there was a UFO outside. When I got outside I looked in the sky at approx 80 degrees (facing south directly across from Immaculate Conception Catholic Church). I saw a very large triangular object relatively low in the sky. I estimate it's distance from me to be between 1000-2000 ft. I would estimate it's location to be over the Hudson River in an area just south of Kingston Point (near area where Rondout Creek meets the hudson, approx.) I would estimate it's size to be between 50-100 yards. It was very large. It hovered completely silent. It had 5-6 lights (white). 1 in each corner of a triangle and 1 between each corner. It remained in that position motionless for approx. 5 minutes. During this time people from the neighborhood were gathering in the church parking lot looking at the object. Many motorists were also stopping their cars and getting out to look at the object. The object then rotated to the left slightly (silently) (the lead point of the triangle was initially pointing east)and moved slightly forward then rotated again left slightly towards the NE then stopped and then proceeded to move in a NE direction slowly (10 mph?). It's path appeared to take it directly over the Hudson River in a northerly direction. After it cleared the trees and went out of sight, everyone went on their way. No police were observed in the area. I saw no media coverage on the event. I would estimate there were between 20-30 witnesses in my area of Delaware Ave. alone. Sky conditions were clear. I could not make out any surface characteristics as the craft appeared very dark. ((NUFORC Note:  Approximate date.  PD));41.969001111111;-74.0671094444442

While I stood in my driveway the colored lights disappeared but the objects stayed still.   I did witness UFOs in Pennsylvania a few years ago but that sighting was at a resort in the woods and lasted for many minutes.  The local news had many reports  mentioned.;41.969001111111;-74.0671094444442
