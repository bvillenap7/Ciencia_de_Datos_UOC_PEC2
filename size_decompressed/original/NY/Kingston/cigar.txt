I was on the new york state thruway heading north between exit 19 and 20 when on the left side of the road a silver or mirrored like cigar shaped object was just above the tree line. It seem to be going around my same speed . I was going around 60 or 70 mph. it would speed up and go slightly ahead and then slow down again and stay with me. I at first thought it had to be some odd reflection but it then abruptly stopped and darted off to the west . I followed it until it was to far or too fast to see. That first encounter lasted about 5 to 7 mins . I was calling a friend to tell them of what had happened when suddenly it was back again. It again stayed about 5 mins and then shot off like nothing i had ever seen and seemed to be gone for good. I never have seen anything like it and i wonder if anyone else had seen something similar. i was sure it would be on the news or something but i never heard a thing.;41.969001111111;-74.0671094444442
