4-sided star shaped object hovering beside 84E;2009-12-03 18:00:00;5;4-sided star shaped object hovering beside 84E I was heading towards Connecticut, driving on 84E.  The sky was not completely dark yet, so I was able to see this object clearly.  Over on the left side of the highway, there was a 4-sided star shaped object hovering from the ground, and all four wings had round bright white lights on it.   The object was not moving and it was not attached to anything.  It was hovering quite low, maybe only 100 feet.  It was absolutely silent and was not causing wind turbulence or anything.   It was the most strangest thing I ever seen.;41.53;-74.2529000000001
