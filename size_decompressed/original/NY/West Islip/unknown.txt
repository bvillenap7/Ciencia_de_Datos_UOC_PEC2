Just an unexplainable swoosh of air as if a plane was going to crash.  But then NOTHING! I had just come home from Applebees and it was about 1:30AM.  I was going to the bathroom and decided to open the window because it was unseasonably warm that night (about 50 F).  I was reading a magazine and then all of a sudden I hear this loud swish of air outside.  It sounded like a large aircraft flying over with absolutely no engines on.  Then I heard a second sound immediately after the first one.  I thought to myself that something is going to crash.  I remember the TWA 800 crash and I thought that it was going to happen again in my back yard.  However, I looked outside and saw nothing.  I thought maybe the object was on the other side of my house and I will hear it crashing soon, however, there was no crash.  it just swooped by with no sound whatsoever other then the sound of the rushing air around it.  I quickly finished up and went outside and it was the weirdest thing.  It was so quiet.  I have never heard it so quiet before in my life.  Not a single sound.  Absolutely no wind.  No sounds from cars or anything else, just complete peacefulness and a uncomfortable quietness.  I don't know what this was that flew by my house that night.  I thought for sure a large plane would come crashing down but nothing ever happened.  It was the strangest thing I have ever experienced.  I still get goosebums thinking about it.;40.7095;-73.2966
Three Contrails;2006-06-21 18:50:00;25 sec;On Wednesday, June 21st, 2006 at 6:50 PM, I witnessed one contrail moving at great speed, then I observed another smaller contrail faster than the first and gaining speed on the first contrail, then a third contrail following both of the objects. All three contrails disappeared at the same time.  The back round was a blue sky no clouds in the early evening, I have video and pictures.  I called the FAA but it was too late they were closed.;40.7095;-73.2966
