March 10, 2012 at approximately 7:30 p.m. Long Island, NY   It was clear night and I was grilling dinner in my backyard.  When I looked to the Western sky I couldnâ€™t help but notice a bright orange, spherical figure that resembled the shape of a hot air balloon.  It almost looked like an orange fireball.  From the ground it appeared to be about half the size of the moon.  It seemed to be moving across the sky from south to north.  I notified my family in my house. Eight people witnessed this object.  It took about two minutes to escape our view.  No one has any idea what it could have been.;40.7095;-73.2966
