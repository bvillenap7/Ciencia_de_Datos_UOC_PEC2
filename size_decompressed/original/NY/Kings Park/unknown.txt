Viewed low in the sky looking North.  Heavy noise similar to a Nascar engine growl, but like the car was next to you.  An object stood still in the air for about 43 seconds with white lights & a single red strobe in the center.  With out any visual effect the sounds stopped and the lights disappeared.  It did not seem as if the object flew away just as if it was gone.  Joned a community meeting 20 minutes later, no one else heard or saw the object.  My first thoughts were Harrier Jet, but that would not explain the Instant Gone scenario.;40.8861;-73.2438
