Intense Bright light  appears to make jet alter flight path;2005-09-26 22:00:00;4 seconds;Intense Bright light  appears to make jet alter flight path September 26th 2005 About 10:00 PM  Sky was partially cloudy - Was sky watching - followed movement of jet heading due north - I would assume that it was over Long Island Sound or nearso as I live less than a mile from the sound.  As jet approached a thin cloud, a ball shape light up - like a lightbulb being turned on - but got bright very rapidly - it was a perfect circle shape when it was lit.  It was at least the size of the jet or larger.  It may have been my imagination but it appeared that the jet altered course to avoid it or stay away from it.  As the jet left the vicinity the light went out.  Unfortunately I have not seen any other report of this - I would imagine that somebody on the jet must have seen it - at the very least the pilot and copilot as it appeared they swerved or altered course slightly to avoid it.
