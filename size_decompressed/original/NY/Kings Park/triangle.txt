Triangle shaped object moving slowly in the night sky.;2008-01-30 19:21:00;5 to 10 minutes;Triangle shaped object moving slowly in the night sky. The object had three bright lights in a triangle form moving slowly through the night sky. There was no sound of an engine or any type of noise.  Object has been seen once before about a week ago at a similar time, but different location. The three lights were too bright to be a star and had a slight reddish color.  The triangle moved slowy and suddenly was harder to see. Object was lost after about 5 to 10 minutes afterward.  Helicopters followed in that direction about 2 minutes after the object was lost.;40.8861;-73.2438
