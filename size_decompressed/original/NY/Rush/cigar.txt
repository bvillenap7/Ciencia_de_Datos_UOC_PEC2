The only aircraft I have ever seen moving that fast were fighter jets, and I used to see them alot when I lived in Florida and serviced the cigarette machines at MacDill AFB in Tampa FL. I have very keen powers of obsevation due to my hobbies of amature astronomy and native american artifact hunting;42.9959;-77.6611
