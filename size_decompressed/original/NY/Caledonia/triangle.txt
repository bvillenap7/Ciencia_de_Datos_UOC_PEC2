Large triangle craft passed overhead, rotated, turned 90 degrees to the right, and vanished.;2013-10-02 22:00:00;5 seconds;Large triangle craft passed overhead, rotated, turned 90 degrees to the right, and vanished. Driving East on NYS Rt. 5 in the town of Caledonia, New York, about a mile west of the Genesee river bridge at Avon, a triangle shaped craft, with lights all along the rear edge, passed over my car, heading in a northern direction, at about 500 ft above the ground.  It was silent.  I would estimate it was a little smaller than a 727 in size.  It flipped (rotated right-to-left) at least a full turn over, did a instant 90 degree right turn, then vanished.  No aircraft that I know of can maneuver like that. I served in the Navy, am an old sky diver, so I can tell height fairly well.  This was something like I have never seen before, and it sent chills up my spine. The security guard where I work, told me the next day that some others driving into work had seen the same thing.;42.9558;-77.8446
Triangular shaped UFO caught on camera in southwest sky Caledonia, NY.;2013-11-24 19:00:00;15 minutes;Triangular shaped UFO caught on camera in southwest sky Caledonia, NY. This object was first brought to my attention by my brother who lives down the road from me.   Last week he stopped me on my way home and pointed it out to me.  I took a shot of it with my cell phone.  it was stationary so it was easy to shoot.  I thought it may just be a star but it was too bright and too low.  When I zoomed in on the picture I took it was triangular in shape!   He says that it has been appearing for the last month.   Last night on my way home from work around 7pm, I noticed it again.  It was very bright and very still almost like a giant flood light in the sky.  After awhile it started to move and then it was gone.   Now I know that its not a star {I originally thought it was the planet Venus because of where it was in the sky}.;42.9558;-77.8446
