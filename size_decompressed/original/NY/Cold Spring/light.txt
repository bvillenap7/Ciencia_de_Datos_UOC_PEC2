I was walking my dog and noticed a bright light in the north eastern sky.  I thought it was a plane because I see alot at night being near Stewart air force base but it was too bright to be a plane at the altitude that it was at and there was no sound.   This was a bright light resembling a bright star and it was moving in a curving direction.  I watched it for about one minuet and then it disappeared.;41.4412;-73.9343
