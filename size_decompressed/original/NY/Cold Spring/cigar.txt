Low craft hovering slowly over Hudson River.;2016-08-03 23:00:00;1-2 minutes;Low craft hovering slowly over Hudson River As I was driving home north on 9-D, across from West Point, me and my friend noticed a very large bright light in the sky moving slowly.   The object wandered overhead, very low, and looked almost like the shape of a rocket, hovering slowly through the night sky.   We watched for as much as had time, but when we turned around further down the road to check it out, the craft had vanished.
