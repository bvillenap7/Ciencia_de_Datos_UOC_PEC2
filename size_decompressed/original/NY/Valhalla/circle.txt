BLACK CIRCULAR DISC;2004-01-05 22:10:00;2 seconds;BLACK CIRCULAR DISC We were looking up at the moon because we always do from time to time, and my boyfriend wanted me to see how nice it looked tonight, and as we are looking at it, a plane is flying past and a HUGE BLACK CIRCULAR OBJECT SHOT past the plane and the moon faster than a blink of an eye!!!!  I am absolutely amazed!  IT was definitely NOT an animal at all.  I don't know what it was but it was fascinating!  Please call me to let me know if ANYONE else saw it.  Thank you!
