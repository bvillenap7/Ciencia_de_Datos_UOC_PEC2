3 Floating Dark Grey Orbs (2 thick) and Extremely Bright Stationary 3-Dimensional Search Light At Westchester Medical Center;2012-06-06 10:00:00;10 minutes;3 Floating Dark Grey Orbs (2 thick) and Extremely Bright Stationary 3-Dimensional Search Light At Westchester Medical Center 3 Very small spheres orbiting.  Around 2 inches thick each.  They looked dark grey. Saw me through a window in Westchester Medical Center.  I was on risperdal at the time.  Around 2 minutes after, there was an extremely bright white search light that moved with great speed.  The light was very collimated, however, I was unable to see the spot that it looked on.  All I noticed was that the light was from a stationary source, and that it could move around in all 3 dimensions.  It was on the top of a building at Westchester Medical Center, overlooking the second floor of the Behavioral Health Center where I was staying at.
