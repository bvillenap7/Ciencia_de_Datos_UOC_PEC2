It was a very bright, disk shaped object with flashing red and green lights. It was spinning and some beams were coming out of it. It stayed in one place most of the time but moved and floated smoothly a bit. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that this report possibly describes the star, Sirius, which can be seen in the southern sky.
