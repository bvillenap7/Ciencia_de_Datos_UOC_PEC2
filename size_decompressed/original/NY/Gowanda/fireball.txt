((HOAX??))  very fast fireballs,very scared.;2010-01-20 03:34:00;<5 sec.;very fast fireballs,very scared me and three of my close friends where walking through a field during a winter camping trip. We saw what looked like three stars flying through the sky but they where on fire and looked to be the size of a close helicopter.  We watched as they flew very very fast through the sky and disappeared past our line of vision. We were completely sober and we all felt very uncomfortable.  We left our campsite immediately as we no longer felt safe because we didn't know where it landed or where it was going.

We have no way to contact the source of the report, given that he provided no contact information.  Probable hoax.  PD));42.4713;-78.9328999999999
