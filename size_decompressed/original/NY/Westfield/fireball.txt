Lake Erie Westfield, NY Multiple Fireballs in Succession July 20, 2012;2012-07-20 22:30:00;30 minutes;Lake Erie Westfield, NY Multiple Fireballs in Succession July 20, 2012 Succession of nine fireballs heading WSW, about 2 min apart for the first 4, then a break of about five minutes, then same for last 5.  With unaided eye, they appeared as points of orange light, but with binoculars, it appeared to be like meteoroids, roughly round in shape, definitely appeared to be trailing fire from atmospheric friction, or propulsion of some sort.  Fireballs is the best word I can think of for them, but their speed was not right in the traditional sense of that word.   Relatively speaking they were traveling slightly higher velocity as an airliner coming in for approach, about 250 knots, but their altitude must have been near the edge of the earth's atmosphere, which I would then estimate as 6,000 - 8,000 MPH.  We may have missed some prior to going outside, but we stayed out for 2 hours afterwards and saw no more.  Please if you saw this phenomenon, post more details than I did.  I am pressed for time right now with two kids biting at my heels.;42.3217;-79.5772
