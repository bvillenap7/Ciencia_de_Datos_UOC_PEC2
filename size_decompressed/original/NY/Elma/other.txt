Low flying, silent, white colored, space shuttle shaped craft flying past my house.;2013-03-05 09:00:00;12 seconds;Low flying, silent, white colored, space shuttle shaped craft flying past my house. Standing, looking out my kitchen window on a beautiful March morning, I noticed  what looked like a small model airplane coming toward my house.  As it came closer, I could see that it was much larger than what I first thought.  It looked like the space shuttle,but much smaller and with more rounded wings.  I would describe it as follows.  About 20' long, 15' from wing tip to wing tip, about 5' in width, all white, no lights, and no sound.   When I saw the object flying toward my house, I noticed that on each side of the nose of the craft, there was what I can only describe as a gray, blurry effect, where two jet engines would be on a normal plane.  (Like a TV station does when showing a news scene and blurring out faces so the people cannot be recognized)   At about 100 feet from my house, the craft suddenly made a slight turn away and flew directly over the steeple of the Methodist Church next door to me, at a height of about 250 feet.  I would guess the speed at about 300 MPH.  It then gained altitude and as it flew away from me,I noticed the back of the object had a rectangle shape, about 10' X 5', all black, with four white nozzles in a row, but with no exhaust gasses coming out of them.  The craft than accelerated and disappeared into billowy white clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.8337;-78.6316999999999
