Silent, goldish-brown craft;2005-02-26 22:15:00;10 seconds;Silent, goldish-brown craft I looked out my window and saw a goldish-brown craft moving east-south-east. It was a solid craft and was shaped like the diamond on a baseball field. The craft was completely silent. The altitude was about the same as a traffic helicopter. No shining lights were visible on the craft at all. I believe it was visible due to it being illuminated by the light of the very bright moon that night. It travelled slower than a helicopter, with a smooth motion. I watched it for about ten seconds before it disappeared behind the trees.;40.7329;-73.7182
