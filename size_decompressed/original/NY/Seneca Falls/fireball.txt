It was almost like a low flying plane on fire, however there was no sound. While on a camping trip with my family the weekend of July 26th, we were all sitting around the fire after a severe thunderstorm and noticed a low flying, slow moving orange fireball.  It was almost like a low flying plane on fire, however there was no sound coming from the object, and nothing attached to it either. There were no blinking lights.  Six of us witnessed this event, and none of us can explain what it was. Unfortunately, we did not get any photos or video.;42.9097;-76.7934
