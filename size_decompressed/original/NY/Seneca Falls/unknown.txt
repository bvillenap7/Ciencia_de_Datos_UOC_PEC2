On August 3, 2020 at approximately 1:00 AM I was woke up by the rustling of several large oak trees.  I looked out my window up to the sky and saw a thin contrail.  It was in the opening in the sky that was covered by a huge gray cloud.  There were only a few areas in the sky not covered by the gray mass. I thought it was unusual for a contrail to be in the sky at one am so I kept looking.  A bright light appeared in an opening in the gray mask that was to the right.  It was slowly moving and disappeared into the gray mass.  Then I saw two more bright lights that were horizontally opposite of each other.  In my opinion it seemed like the first light could have been in the center of these two forming a triangle.  Then the the two lights disappeared into the gray mass as it appeared to cover the entire sky at that point.  The next day I looked at our security cameras and unfortunately they do not reach the sky area however, at the same time I saw the lights i! n the sky an unusual shadow was covering our backyard which gradually disappeared.  I checked other nights at that time and for the entire week there were no shadows on the ground showing only on the night I saw the lights in the sky on August 3, 2020 at 1 AM. Thank you.
