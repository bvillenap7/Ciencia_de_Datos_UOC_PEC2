Orange globe in the sky;2008-08-13 20:35:00;3 minutes;Orange globe in the sky    We were walking down the street and this round orange globe, almost like a balloon in the center and shaped like a star at the bottom was floating overhead.  It was silent.  It was so close you could see right through the center.  It continued south and upward at a steady pace until it eventually looked like an orange star in the sky and then it disappeared.;42.9097;-76.7934
