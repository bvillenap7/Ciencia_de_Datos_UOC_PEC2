The object moves slowly at first to the left than upwards and then fast back down only this time going to the right. I thought at lst it may be a satelite, but I don't believe that they can move this slow and then very fast, also why would there be the pulsating lights? I would appreciate it if someone can post a message as to what this may be. Thank you! P.S. The object was sited in the northeastern skies.;43.7311;-75.3658999999999
A bright light almost a peach color, faded completely then reappeared again after several minutes;2003-09-10 20:00:00;seconds;A bright light almost a peach color, faded completely then reappeared again after several minutes We were all sitting on the deck of a friends home in upstate NY, when we noticed over the trees at about possibly thousands of feet in the air that there was a very bright glowing object.  We knew it wasn't Mars because the Moon and Mars was on the opposite side.  We continued to watch for about 30 or so seconds when it just totally faded out.  We wasn't sure what it was so we waited to see if it reappeared which it did several times in different spots and faded out.  The last time we saw it there were 2 objects but away from each other, when all of a sudden the one joined the other them apart again and one faded then the other. Could this have been flares or something else?  Thanks for your answer PS  We live near Ft. Drum in Watertown.;43.7311;-75.3658999999999
