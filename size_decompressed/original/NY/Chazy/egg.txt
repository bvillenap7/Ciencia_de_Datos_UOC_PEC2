Small egg shaped object with blinking white light rose into the sky;2012-05-11 17:00:00;30 seconds;Small egg shaped object with blinking white light rose into the sky I was out for a walk along Fiske Road near the intersection with Duprey Road, and observed what first looked like an escaped birthday balloon being carried along by the wind (it was a windy day) approximately 30 feet from the ground and maybe 200 feet away. In began to gain altitude slowly as if rising in the wind, but then accelerated rapidly and rose up and away and was gone.  Before it disappeared from view I observed a white blinking light coming from it and at that point realized that it was a UFO! It made no noise.  It could not have been anything else.  Its shape was sort of fat and oblong from my nearly horizontal view of it while it was nearer to the ground. Interestingly, there is a small electrical sub-station in the vicinity of where it appeared to have been traveling from.  The object appeared to be small, maybe 3-5 feet in diameter.;44.8852;-73.4471
