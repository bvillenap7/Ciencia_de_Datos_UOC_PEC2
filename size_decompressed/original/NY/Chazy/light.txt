Macadam Road;1973-10-15 17:30:00;5 minutes;Exact location: 44 deg 52' 33.74 North, 73 deg 28' 52.99, thanks to GPS and Google Earth (didn't have either back then). Macadam Road maybe a couple hundred feet west of Ridge Road, Chazy, NY. Exact date may be a week sooner or later, not too sure of that but it was early samll game hunting season then.  3 of us were bird hunting in the area and it was getting dark fast. Done, and heading home, we stopped just to watch flocks of ducks landing in the (sanctuary) ponds to the south/south west of our position on the road. Overcast, maybe 2,500 feet with a steady wind from west as I remember.  During some of the joking and talking, I saw bright magenta (red) light descend straight down, unaffected by wind and with no smoking trail or sound, to the ground by the pond in front of the tree line slightly to the west of where we were looking and maybe 1/4 mile away, a good guess. It was a brilliant light with kind of a haze surrounding it. Size is hard to say...maybe from basketball to large beach ball in size. As it got closer to the ground it actually slowed down and the light turned off. I assume it was on the ground in tall grasses etc. That is when I mentioned it to the others because they were looking back in my direction as I recall.  Maybe 5 minutes went by, after swapping a few more stories, I saw the light turn on again and pointed at it...this time all 3 of us saw it ascend straight up, very fast, no sound, no smoke, no wings, no rotor blades, nothing but brilliant pure silent magenta light accelerating into the clouds, seemingly immune to the effects of the wind. Now that is what got my curiosity going, you know, something coming down and soft landing then, later, taking off at an incredible speed all with no sound and in a wooded/marshy area. We were close enough to hear ducks making noise but that thing was silent.  The other 2 weren't all that interested after seeing it, and I never thought about it again until a few years ago. As a former pilot I can say that it did not look like aerodynamic flight and so I do not know what it was. Thinking about it now, that was not a good 'alternate landing site' for any aircraft for any reason.  I wasn't sure whether to report this old sighting or not, I am sure of what we observed then, just don't know what it was.
