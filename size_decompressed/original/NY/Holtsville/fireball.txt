I was standing in front of my kitchen sink. In the reflection of my glass table top to my left I can see the sky and eave of the house.  The windows to the left of the table face north.  A small, bright, yellow/orange star shaped object came into view on the table reflection from the north and left view over the eave of the house to the south.  It took 2 seconds to enter the table reflection and leave it.  I then ran outside to look at the sky to the south but saw nothing.  There was no streak attached to this object. I decided to test my vision making sure it was not the reflection of a passing car with it's lights on.  When a car was approaching with it's lights on, I went back into position and watched the reflection.   No cars, or the street could be seen in the view of the table top's reflection- only the sky, Treetop and the eave of the house.  There was also no sound when the object passed. Just one single, orb type light that gently passed in the sky.;40.8105;-73.0416
