V-shape object seen in backyard during lunar eclipse.;2003-11-08 20:00:00;10seconds;V-shape object seen in backyard during lunar eclipse. It was the night of the lunar eclipse. I was in my backyard with my family and finacee looking threw a telescope at the lunar eclipse when my fiancee had tapped me on my shoulder and told me to look up in the sky in the Northeastern direction, when I looked up it looked like a v-shape object with white lights, no blinking no noise, nothing. It looked as if it was blending with the night stars and dark sky. It glided from northeast to southeast and then disappeared when it got to the treelines. I knew it was not a plane b/c I'm in the flight path to the airport and this was not a plane. Even when planes pass you still can see them threw the tree line because they are loud and the lights blink. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the total lunar eclipse occurred on November 08, 2003, and we have amended the date above.;40.8105;-73.0416
