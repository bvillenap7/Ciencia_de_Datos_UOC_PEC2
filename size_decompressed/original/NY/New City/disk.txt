I am 12 years old.  I was with a lot of other people.  They were all screaming and in a fight, but i didn't want to get involved so i turned around and tried not to get involved.  I looked about 100 feet away and i saw a green thing floating from the sky...i didn't know what it was but i noticed it fell from something so i looked up to see what it fell from.  It was a disk shaped craft and had lights going all around it...i was so scared and in shock because i have seen UFO's before.  I pulled one of the girls hair to get her attention cause i wasn't able to talk...i pointed to the opbject and everyone saw it...i'm not sure how many people saw it but i am sure of 3 other people.  This object the lights were bright then they dimmed and turned off then slowly lit back up...it was as if the lights were dimming on and off...i was very scared but curious...i folled the object w/ my eyes not noticing if anyone else was and i noticed that it stoped over my head...i looked up and then it zoomed off to a the south...was this an alien space ship?  i think it was!!!!
