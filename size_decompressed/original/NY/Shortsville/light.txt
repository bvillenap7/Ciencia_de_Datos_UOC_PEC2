As my friend and I sat outside on a totally clear night  we noticed a light through a distant tree line to the west.  At first we thought it was a star low in the sky that we hadn’t noticed but quickly realized it was rising up from behind the tree line. As it cleared the trees we saw a very very large, very bright light almost shaped like a diamond that changed color from white to blue and then pink and purple.  It rose steadily to an unknown altitude and then the light began to fade to a dull white but never completely went away.  At this point it began to move directly toward us.   We knew it wasn’t a plane as it had none of the regular blinking lights and we could see two planes in the sky to compare it to.  I currently live just a few miles from an airport and see and hear planes up close at night on a regular basis and I have never seen any that looked like this. As it got closer we could clearly see one very large round dull white light on the bottom front and two more of the same but half the size next to each other behind the large one.  Next to the smaller round lights were two super small dull white blinking lights.   The object moved steadily toward us and directly overhead.  It was difficult to tell the size shape or altitude but we could hear a very low hum sound as it passed overhead.  The round lights were huge but not bright at all as we looked up at it.  It moved over the house behind us and then was gone. I believe I have seen something similar when I was a teenager living on Cape Cod.;42.9762;-77.2391
