Twinkling red/white bright star that moved ever so slightly for 30 minutes then dissapeared;2008-09-23 21:00:00;30 minutes;Twinkling red/white bright star that moved ever so slightly for 30 minutes then dissapeared I was in my yard on the phone at approx 9pm est on Tuesday evening when I noticed a twinkling large star in the sky west of me.  As I talked on the phone I thought it was changing color from white to red so I assumed it was a plane.  I realized that in 15 minutes it moved approx 1/2 inch towards the treeline ahead of me. I thought this was strange because several planes went past this object and hit the treeline with 2-3 seconds.  I was mesmerized because I knew it was moving ever so slightly and changing colors from white to red. I watched it for 30 minutes (I was stationary sitting on my patio chair) then it just dissapeared instantly.;40.8275;-73.1225
