Same object flashing red yellow green white for 90 min in NW sky daily since 9-23-08  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD));2008-10-07 19:00:00;90 min;Same object flashing red yellow green white for 90 min in NW sky daily since 9-23-08 I reported a sighting on 9/23/08 - This is the same thing and it appears every night since that night at the same time.  I checked the J-track website to see if a satellite was what I was seeing.  There were no visable satellites at that time. I called my mother who live 30 miles west of me and made her look at it. She could see that it was NW in the sky from her and was blinking slightly from red to white. It moves across the NW sky on long Island (north of the LIE)for about 90 minutes then is gone. Tonight I showed my husband and we looked through binoculars. It is egg shaped and has a series of lights flashing red-yellow-green and white around the perimeter. The center is black. I would love to know what this is. As stated it has been there every night to date from 9-23-08. I am sure it will be in the same spot tomorrow night moving the same pattern. Planes are also passing this object as there are 2 major airports in that direction. I am outside every night at that time with my dog I would have seen it prior to 9-23-08 which is the very 1st sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD));40.8275;-73.1225
