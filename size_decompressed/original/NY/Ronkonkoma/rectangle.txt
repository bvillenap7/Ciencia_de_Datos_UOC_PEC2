I was parked in a shopping center waiting for my girlfriend to finish cashing her paycheck.  That’s when I saw a woman standing on the sidewalk in front of the store pointing up. I jumped out of my truck to see what she was pointing at. I saw an object that was rectangle in shape and was only around 50 feet above the light polls in the parking lot.  The object was around 2 feet wide 4 feet long and razor thin. It had a transparent texture with holes. In other words it looked like a rectangle frame covered in wax paper and the wax paper had all holes evenly spaced in it and only the outer rim of the hole would stand out. The centers of the holes were also transparent.  This object stayed in one spot rotating very slowly. As it rotated the sun would shine off its edges. This is what would keep you from loosing sight of it. The center did not reflect sunlight.  I was wondering why it wasn’t blowing around in the wind. The wind was around 10 miles and hour and gusty at times yet this object wasn’t affected by it.  Besides myself looking at this object, there was the lady who got my attention to look at it along with other people around her.  Suddenly after 5 minutes of watching this, it suddenly went straight up quite fast. If it wasn’t for the sun reflecting off its edges I would have lost it sooner.;40.8275;-73.1225
