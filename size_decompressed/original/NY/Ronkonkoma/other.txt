Hovering black object seen in Ronkonkoma NY going eastbound on the Long Island Expressway;2017-04-13 18:20:00;5 minutes;Hovering black object seen in Ronkonkoma NY going eastbound on the Long Island Expressway Around 6:20 p.m. on April 13th, 2017, in Ronkonkoma, NY, I was headed eastbound on the Long Island Expressway, when I noticed a strange object in the sky.  The object looked like a plane at first, but then I noticed it was hovering over the one spot in the sky.  I've never seen a plane hover and it wasn't a helicopter.  It was certainly smaller than a plane, but bigger than a hand held drone.   It wasn't someone paragliding either (which is common in the region).  It looked like a distorted shaped black object slightly elongated, just hovering in the sky.   I drove off the expressway and looped around and still could see it in relatively the same spot as I drove closer to it.  I tried to get closer, but it ended up being blocked by the noise barrier walls.  I drove up further until it was in the view again, but it was gone by that point.  This was near the Long Island MacArthur Airport but certainly was not a plane.;40.8275;-73.1225
