When the UFO flew over my house it turned west and flew heading towards the city.  Approximately 30 yrs this aircraft stopped what looked like a star, the lights from the aircraft that went black, 5 minutes later the star that I mentioned was not a star this UFO lit up like a Christmas tree and flew north.  The aircraft that went dark now had its lights on and flew north, then from the south here comes a third one which only had white lights.  The third UFO flew fast them stopped then took off out of sight.  About an hour later the three UFO’s return and just sat in the sky with lights blinking on and off, these UFO’s were about some of the stars.  Now I am afraid and I went into my house locked the doors.  About 15 mins later we went back outside and all 3 UFO’s were gone. For thee record, this is not the first time we seen this type of aircraft, UFO whatever you want to call it;40.8275;-73.1225
