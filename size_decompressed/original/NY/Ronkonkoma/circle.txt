Stange unidentified red flashing lights in Southern sky moving west;2012-07-12 09:15:00;20 minutes;Stange unidentified red flashing lights in Southern sky moving west My wife & I were driving East on Portion road about 9:15 PM.  I was the passager facing the Southern sky when I noticed 2 or 3 red flashing lights.  They were defintely not planes.   I asked my wife to pull over into a parking lot near the Ronkonkoma Blockbuster.  We got out of the car and I pointed to her those objects and she saw them too.  They were traveling from the Southern Horizen on a course to the Western sky.   If they were planes they would have been close enought to hear an engine.  NO sound was omitted from them   They had flashing to them with some white light but not like navigation lights on airplanes.  One two reached the Western sky others came out from the Southern sky.  About eight or nine by my account & my wife. I contacted 911 but officer was not concerned.;40.8275;-73.1225
3 objects spotted over exit 59 on LIE;2014-10-07 20:00:00;20 seconds;3 objects spotted over exit 59 on LIE 3 circular looking craft over the long island expressway near exit 59.  The objects were arranged in a triangular formation, with 2 in perfect alignment and one slightly out of alignment, to form a sort of lopsided triangle.  After seeing the objects, my view was blocked by a row of trees.  When I circled back around to the same spot (approx. 2 minutes later), the objects were gone.  Immediately following this event helicopters could be seen and heard circling the area.;40.8275;-73.1225
