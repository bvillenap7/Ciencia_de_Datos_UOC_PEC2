As I was getting out of the car, I noticed what appeared to be a bright shooting star object fly overhead heading north toward Long Island Sound.   My friend and I both saw the object move very quickly and then it seemed to loop down and head straight as if it was crashing toward the ground.  We both thought it may have been an aircraft that went down to the north of where we live, perhaps on the northern part of Long Island or in the Long Island Sound.   We checked the local news and heard nothing about an airplane or helicopter mishap.   The bright light was much brighter then the stars and the sky conditions were clear with no noticeable cloud cover.  It may have been a meteorite, however, wanted to report in case others saw it as well.;40.713;-73.5596999999999

I have been watching these objects for more than a half hour. There are no Stars in the sky at this time. From where I am it appears to be in the southern sky.;40.713;-73.5596999999999
