At first it was loud almost like an aircraft engine directly above us. Then it changed to a lower pitched sound and then after a few seconds it changed to a higher pitch, almost as if some thing was accelerating, then back to a low pitch before it beacame quite again.  Immediately after that we heard a commercial aircraft in the distance which passed over our house as usual.  Not sure what it was but the sound was definitely coming from above and it came as suddenly as it stopped.  It did not sound like a vehicle or motorcycle we live on a fairly quiet street and now when cars pass by.;40.713;-73.5596999999999
