While looking through photos that were taken by my webcam, during the day of 03/18/07 I came across 46 clear frames containing an unknown black object (1 object)  in the sky. There were actually about another 16 or so frames that I didn’t use because the webcam I use is wireless and subject to interference and these frames weren’t centered correctly or had many interference lines in them. The total amount of frames was about 64.  Each frame is 30 second between shots. The ufo would have had to be in view for 32 minutes. The camera is aimed at the eastern sky and the photos are sent to my website at http://aboutfacts.net .  The black object slowly moved from west to east at an upward angle until it was too far east for the camera to see since a wall blocked the view.  I don’t know the exact time the photos were taken,  since they are not time stamped, but by their placement I can assume it was somewhere between 12:00 pm and 3:00 pm.  The object looked almost like a completely black cloud, but it was the deepest black you would ever see, an unnatural black. As it moved across the field of vision it changed its shape. I am including photos of it from my webcam and a gif animation I made from the 46 clear frames.  My Background: I am retired and the webmaster of http://aboutfacts.net.
