They're not here to mess withour heads so much (well, maybe a little), they're here to sweep away any large asteroids coming by here;1992-10-09 19:49:00;40 seconds;They're not here to mess withour heads so much (well, maybe a little), they're here to sweep away any large asteroids coming by here A 5 x 4 x 11 meteorite, from the most fully documented fireball in history, had to be intelligently aimed at its 5 x 22-inch target -- a car's right tail-light -- in order to convey a message.  That the chrome delineating two long sides of the signal-light was not significantly damaged by the impact presented a paradox:  how does this happen without (very) intelligent design?   This occurred in 1992, three days before the Ames Research Center commenced its Targeted Search, otherwise known as the High Resolution Microwave Survey, NASA's first (and only) radio-astronomical search for aliens.  NASA: ET exists?  ET: Right, Ames. Peekskill.  Targeted?  Ames?   Dozens of extraordinary, if unlikely, details surrounding this and three subsequent  meter/impact events point very strongly to intelligent design.;41.2923;-73.9184
