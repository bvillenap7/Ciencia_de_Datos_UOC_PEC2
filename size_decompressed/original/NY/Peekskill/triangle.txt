Large, silent, triangle shaped vehicle hovered about 100-200 ft over the house for about 3-4 minutes. My neighbor's three children came running and pointing to the sky.  I looked up and saw lights in a a triangle shape not more than 200 feet overhead.  It moved VERY slowly and made NO noise.  My boyfriend was also with me at the time.  He is an amateur pilot but could not explain what the object was.  My first thought was that it was small planes flying in formation, but there was no deviation between lights and no movement...it seemed to be one huge object...about the size of 3 football fields.  Later, they said it was ultra-lights, (from Stormville) but nobody who saw this and other similar sightings agreed.  There were several sightings over the course of the year in  the Hudson River Valley.;41.2923;-73.9184
Triangle shaped Orange colored translucent object hovered near Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant emitting a loud whooshing sound.;1985-07-05 21:00:00;8 mins;Triangle shaped Orange colored translucent object hovered near Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant emitting a loud whooshing sound. I was laying on my living roof sofa and my Three friends were sitting on my front porch(high on a cliff)overlooking the Hudson River. All of a sudden my One friend started to call out my name. I was starting to doze off and ignored his calls at first, until the tone of his voice went frantic. I jumped up and ran outside. The object was clearly visable between my house and the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant. The object was an Orange colored translucent Tiangle. It almost seemed to be stuck or frozen. It was emitting a high pitched whooshing sound. My One young friend started to jump up and down and yell take me,take me at which point the object seemed to come closer. I distinctly felt menaced and started to cower toward the house. The object then made a 360 degree circle out over the river and then disappeared over the tree line to the East.;41.2923;-73.9184
