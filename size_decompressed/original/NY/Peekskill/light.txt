Brilliant bright light in the twilight sky;2007-07-20 20:30:00;20 minutes;Brilliant bright light in the twilight sky I was in my backyard smoking a cigarette. I do believe in UFOs and I love weather related things so I am always looking at the sky when I am outside. I noticed a very very bright light. The sun had not totally gone down yet , and there were no other stars in the sky. I grabbed my binoculars to see if I could see it closer, but it was hard. All it did was made it look even shinier and the form would change because of the lenses I am assuming. I grabbed my video recorder instead and tried to get as close to the object as I could. Through that, this bright light looked like it had a type of 'strobe' effect. It had remained in the same spot for 15 minutes (as far as I know, because I dont know how long it was there before I went outside) but as i was viewing it thru my camera, it moved and I was no longer able to see it as trees were obstructing my view. It did this quite slowly , not a quick motion. I went to all of my windows of my 2 story house to see if I could capture its view again, but to my dismay, it was gone. It was the brightest thing I've ever seen in the sky ever. I dont know 'N,S,E,W' it was but I do know that it was in the area of a power plant. I am not sure if i am able to name the plant. I will continue to look online daily to see if anybody else has seen what I saw. Thank you.;41.2923;-73.9184
