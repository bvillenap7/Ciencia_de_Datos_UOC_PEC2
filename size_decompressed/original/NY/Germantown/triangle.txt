On our way home from work and picking up our daughter up from the sitter and noticed a Bluish Gray ball of light seem to just fall out of the sky from a distance.  It was just about dusk at this time.   About a minute later we arrived home, and as we began to enter our back door, we noticed a huge bright ball of white light coming from the south of our field.  It was very, low and so bright.   We decided to stay right there and watch it.  It seemed like it took forever to fly over us.  When it was over us it was a triangle with a rounded front (this is where the bright white light was emanating from) and underneath in the middle tgere was a vright red light and on each angle it looked like there was a Gold light for each angle.   There was absolutely no noise whatsoever.  It was maybe 30 feet above us.  It was moving North.  After it disappeared, we went into the house.  Ten minutes later, we heard helicopters and looked out the window.  There were 2 big choppers flying over our field with red lights.  It almost seemed like they were searching for something.  They left 10-15 minutes later.;42.1213;-73.858
