At 7 pm in Germantown, NY, when looking south I saw a VERY large light, with beams emitting from it that were VERY bright standing stationary in the sky over the Hudson River.  It looked to be above the Kingston/Saugerties, NY area.  It was a steady light that just hung in the sky.   I watched it for 10-12 minutes and then saw smaller lights headed right to it.  There were 3 or 4 of these smaller moving lights (which I thought were small aircraft).  They were moving like regular airplanes with flashing red lights.   After 3 or 4 more minutes the huge light disappeared behind cloud cover (the clouds covered it).  The smaller lights flew into the clouds and I lost sight of them.  I went into my house after a few more minutes and locked my door.   Then returned to the windows a couple of times to see whether I could see this phenomena again.  I could not.  The cloud cover remained until I went to sleep. A little about me:  I am a highly competent retired woman, living alone next door to my daughter.  I have lived in Germantown, NY for almost 10 years.  I have keen eyesight, do not drink alcohol or imbibe any other substances aside from coffee and tea.  I am 75 years old and lead a busy and rewarding life.;42.1213;-73.858
