Two unknown objects seen over Vernon, NY, on 07/12/17.;2017-07-12 23:00:00;1 minute;Two unknown objects seen over Vernon, NY on 07/12/17. Two objects(lights) were noticed after they had passed overhead.  These objects produced no sound and there was no beacon as with normal aircraft.  These objects were moving away from us and the intensity of the light didn't seem to change.  Therefore, I am discounting landing lights as the source of illumination.   I am unable to estimate height and speed due to darkness but it took less than one minute for these 2 objects to go from overhead to beyond the visible horizon.  Also, as they moved away, they seemed to change position in relation to each other  as if they were in a race.;43.0945;-75.5627
