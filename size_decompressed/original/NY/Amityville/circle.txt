I was sitting there sometime very late in my room, I was 10yrs old, my whole house was sleeping.  So I decide to start staring out my window.  I see this small circular almost spinning top with different color lights surrounding it.  This thing was very close to my window.  It whizzed left and right and it seemed to change size as it did this.  Then it was gone with enormous speed.   I have never witnessed anything like this since but I have never forgotten this either.  There was one time I actually combed through the newspaper and came upon a group of kids who also saw a UFO in Massapequa, that is one town over.  The year was 1984.;40.6844;-73.4183
