Craft that changed shape, then shot into the water.;2007-01-01 14:00:00;15 ninutes;Craft that changed shape, then shot into the water. Cashew shaped at first, hovering in the sky. So I thought maybe this is a bird. But then the birds flew next to it, and they did not look similar at all. Then I thought maybe this is a kite, but the area that it flew over was too big for kite range. It hovered over an island in the distance at the beach, it changed shapes, going back and forth, scanning the island. At some points it was compleatly still. It would morph from a cashew shape to a pill shape. There was only one craft that I saw. Shapes would change, it was black or a very dark color. After the craft was done scanning this island, its shape got skinny and shot into the water. Background was just sky, and a little island, there were no trees in the way its a compleatly open area at the beach. There were some people in cars but I dont think anyone was looking at what I was looking at, from their point of view there might have been a tree in the way.;40.6844;-73.4183
