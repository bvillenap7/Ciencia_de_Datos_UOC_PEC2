I notice 4 circular objects in rotation form in the cloud.  It kept going round in circles in the same cloud but changing colors as it rotated in the same spot.   It disappeared for about 5 minutes I ran to take a picture but it came out too dark.  I then ran upstairs called my husband and he saw it as well.   All my years living there I have never witnessed such an occurrence.   This lasted approximately 15 to 20 minutes.  It rotated in a square formation.
