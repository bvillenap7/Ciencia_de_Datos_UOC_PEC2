Possible artifact from a reported UFO crash in 1992 in Yaphank Long Island NY;1992-11-24 00:00:00;ufo crash;Possible artifact from a reported UFO crash in 1992 in Yaphank Long Island NY I have in my possession an object which I feel may well be an artifact fron the Yaphank UFO crash of 1992. i. Size 2 X 2.5 2. Weight Approx. 2 ounces 3. Color: Brownish 4. Appears to be metallic 5. It can be scratched with a metallic tool but nevertheless appears quite hard 6. It is not attracted to nor does it repel a magnet 7. When accidentally dropped onto a hard wood floor from waist height it did not fracture 8. There is a concavity in the object which makes it resemble a miniature ash tray Clearly though it is not that. 9. Conccavity has a shape that somewhat resembles a leaf of sorts, or possibly a ping pong paddle with a very short handle. 10.Around the periphery of the leaf and bordering it is a beading that appears as a thin line 11.The object appears to have endured great heat and pressure. It is blackned and charred on its under surface and the blackness does not rub off. The object appears also to be distorted. Appears that extreme heat and pressure resulted in object beginning to melt and then to re-solidify into a distorted shape and losing some of its symmetry. 12.There appears to be symbols inscribed on the periphery of the object. A coup couple - two or three- seem somewhat discernible, while others appear either        obliterated or severely marred by the heat and stress. 13.I tried to photograph a drawing that I had made of the symbols and transfer them onto my computer. My camera was not working properly, so I was not able to do this. If you prefer, I can fax the drawing over to you.  I hope that I have covered all bases on this issue. To me the object does not seem to be of this world. It does not appear to be of Native American origin. It was discovered a few miles north of the crash site along, I am told, with many other physical artifacts that someone claims were diagnosed as being of meteorite origin. It is quite obvious that my object was made by a being or beings with intelligence, whether they be human or extraterrestrial. At the tip of the concavity is a small hole about 2mm deep and 1 to 1.5 mm in diameter. It is horizontal and just below the lip of the concavity and in the midline. The hole is too perfectly round and too perfectly positioned to be an accident. Perhaps it is the female part of a attachment that would lock something into the concavity. My own unprofessional opinion is that the object may be a medallion or some csort of decorative element. Please respond. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness sends a photograph of the object, but we don't know what it is.  It could be a piece of slag, but that is only a guess.  Until the object is analyzed by a laboratory, its nature will remain an unknown.  PD));40.8347;-72.9179
White Blob Hovering over Minumum Security Facility;2003-04-10 12:10:00;10 seconds;White Blob Hovering over Minumum Security Facility I was driving North getting on to Yaphank Av, from Horseblock Rd.  I stobe light flash caught my attention, when I looked North West I saw a whitish shape hovering above the Suffolk County Minumum Security facility.  I watched it until the trees obsctructed my view.  There were no visible lights, other than the initial flash that attracted my attention. Once I reached my destination (on the same road), I watched the general area for about 5 minutes, but there was no further sign of the object.  But an airplane did fly near the same location about 5 minutes after my sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a member of law enforcement.  PD));40.8347;-72.9179
