I believe that it was reportedly shaped like a boom-a-rang with one arm engulfed by a blazing fire. Shortly after impact a SWAT team of eight men dressewd in black arrived by helicopter and roped the area off for 4 days. Reported by eyewitnesses that bodies and alien craft was found. Despite eyewitnesses government denies that it was a ufo. 1989 Nearby, not far from crash site, a ufo landing was reported. Despite several eye witnesses government denies that this was a ufo. Before and since these incidents, there have been many other sightings.  Recently, a few miles north of crash site several objects were found buried beneath  the sand. I possess one of them.  Object: 2 X 2.5 Weight 2 ounces Color:  Brownish or copper in tone? Appears fairly hard I am able to scratch a line in it with a matal tool Did not fracture when accidentally dropped from waist height onto hardwood floor Resembles a small ash tray, but clear it is not that. Cavity on one side appears to have definitely been placed by an intelligent being. It is shaped somewhat like a leaf with a beading that appears as a thin line arohnd its' periphery. The other side appears blackened as if charred by great heat. The blasckness does not rub off.     Object appears to be metallic and distorted due to subjection to high heat and pressure. Is neither attracted nor repelled by a magnet Appeaes to be not of this world. My unprofessional opinion is that it may be a medallion of sorts or some sort of decorative element.;40.8347;-72.9179
