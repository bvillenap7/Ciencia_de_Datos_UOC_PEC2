I looked out of the window and saw three fireballs, all in a horizontal row.  They were as clear as can be, and quite low.  Then they just flew across the sky.  I went to the window on another wall and saw that they had gone over some trees in the distance.  But at first there were only two there.  I watched as one deliberately spaced itself on top of, but not touching, the other.  The next thing that happened was the third fireball zipped around the corner of the house, also, and then they were all together again, over the trees.  Of course, eventually, the trees made it harder to see them, but I could see enough to see that they were still there.  I actually got in my car to try to see where they went, but I was so excited, I took a few wrong turns.  Finally I saw one in a field off of highway 180, and it didn't appear to be as lit up.  I did not see ! the other two, so perhaps they had turned off all lights.  I did not have the nerve to try to walk to the one, and so I turned around, went home, and talked about it on Facebook.  I had never even heard of fireballs.  I had heard of metal saucers.  I looked on the internet, and sure enough, the fireballs existed, seemingly more in later years.  I really did not want to believe in UFO's, but after what I saw, I have no choice.;44.01;-76.0686
