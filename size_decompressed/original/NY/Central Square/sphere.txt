I first thought it was a plane, but then noticed there were no flashing lights.  It moved from straight overhead to beyond the trees, I ran beyond the trees and looked around in the sky, it was gone, no trace.  I felt amazed/surprised at seeing this.  I lost sight of it behind the trees and then I ran behind them and looked around in the sky it was gone.   About 30 seconds or about 1 minute long, not longer.  I saw it in the binoculars and it was bright as or brighter than Jupiter. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the time above.  PD));43.3068;-76.1857
