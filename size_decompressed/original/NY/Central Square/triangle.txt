Triangular metallic object emitting trail of orange, travelling extremely fast;2001-07-23 18:17:00;15-20 seconds;Triangular metallic object emitting trail of orange, travelling extremely fast I was drivingdown I-81S towards Syracuse.  About 1/2 mile past Central Square, I saw a triangular object going at a downwards angle from west to east.  When the sunlight hit it, it reflected the sunlight.  It was extremely bright.  Behind it was a cone of some sort coming to a point of orange.  I don't know whether it was fire, or vapor?  I knew the object was going extremely fast, for it travelled the length of my windshield in no time at all.  Also, it was below the clouds(ceiling).  I had enough time to hold up my hand, and determine it was the size of my thumbnail when my arm was fully extended, and the vapor behind it was approximately 4-6 inches across my windshield.  It then disappeared behind the trees? ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the event occurred between 1815 and 1820 hrs..  We have changed the time here.  PD));43.3068;-76.1857
