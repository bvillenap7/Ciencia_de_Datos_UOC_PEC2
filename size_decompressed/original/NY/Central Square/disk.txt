WHEN OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I SAW OUT MY SIDE LIVINGROOM WINDOW WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE REFLECTION OF POLICE LIGHTS, I WENT OVER TO THE WINDOW AS I BEGAN TO GET CLOSER I REALIZED THAT IT WAS NOT WHAT IT HAD APPEARD TO BE, IT WAS A SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT VERY HIGH IN THE WESTERN SKY JUST HOVERING IN ONE AREA. THE TOP WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY WITH RED,GREEN AND BLUE LIGHTS AND THE BOTTOM HAD A VERY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT. IT WOULD SPIN VERY FAST IT LOOKED LIKE THE TOY TOP I USED TO PLAY WITH AS A CHILD AND THEN IT WOULD SLOW DOWN AND HOVER UP AND DOWN AND THEN BEFORE MY OWN EYES WITHOUT EVENIG BLINKING IT DISSAPEARED.THE SIGHTING LASTED APPROX.45 MIN. ON THE EVENING OR EARLY MORNING OF 9/7/2002 AT APPROX. 2:00 AM I RECIEVED A PHONE CALL FROM A FRIEND TRAVELING HOME NORTH FROM CICERO TO CENTRAL SQUARE. SHE SAID THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY STRANGE IN THE NORTHERN SKY.  WHAT SHE DESCRIBED WAS THE SAME DESCRIPTION THAT I GAVE YOU. LAST NIGHT WE PATIENTLY WAITED AT EACH OTHERS OWN HOMES (WITHIN 3 MILES APART )AND AT APPROX.9:30 P.M. THE SAME OBJECT APPEARED IN THE SAME NORTHERN SKY AS IT DID THE NIGHT BEFORE.THIS TIME IT HOVERED FOR OVER 2 HOURS. MY FRIEND MADE A FEW PHONE CALLS TO SEE IF SOME PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT AREA COULD SEE IT. SHE WAS ABLE TO LOCATE A FRIEND IN NORTH SYRACUSE (10 MILES SOUTH OF CENTRAL SQUARE) WHO COULD SEE IT .SHE ALSO LOCATED ANOTHER FRIEND IN BREWERTON (3 MILES SOUTH) OF CENTRAL SQUARE WHO COULD SEE IT AS WELL.MY HUSBAND ASND I HAVE CAPTURED THE OBJECT ON VIDEO TAPE ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT AS CLEAR AS WITH THE NAKED EYE. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the first possibility to be ruled out would be a twinkling star, or a celestial body of some variety.  PD));43.3068;-76.1857
