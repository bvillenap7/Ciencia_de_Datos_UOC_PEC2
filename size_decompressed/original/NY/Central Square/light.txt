Amber ball of light over Syracuse.;2016-11-23 21:15:00;10 minutes;Amber ball of light over Syracuse I was driving back home from Watertown, heading south on 81.  When I was passing the Parish exit looking at the city lights reflecting off the clouds when I noticed an amberish colored light in the clouds.  There is an overcast tonight so no stars are visible.  It didnt have directional lights like a tipical aircraft. It stayed in the same position for about 10 minutes.  When I passed by tall trees I lost sight but when I came to a clearing it was gone.  Did anyone else see this tonight?;43.3068;-76.1857
