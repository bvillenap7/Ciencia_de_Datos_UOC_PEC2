Hoovering disk like object by Father and Son, Brookyln, NY 1970;1970-10-01 16:00:00;3 minutes;Hoovering disk like object by Father and Son, Brookyln, NY 1970 To whom it may concern,  My Father and I were going to my grandparent's home one afternoon. As we were heading towards the back of the home we both immediately saw a disk like object hoovering above my Grandmother's vegetable garden. It was so close that I went to pick up a rock to throw it but my Dad smacked the rock out of my hand.I was six years old at the time !  It was your classic disk shape, light grey in color, with multi-colored lights I think that were roatating in a clockwise fashion. It was hovering not more than 20 feet from us yet it did have some movement in trying to stay in place but ever so slightly. I don't recall any heat coming off the object. I did hear a buzzing sound. The dimensions weren't very large maybe big enough to fit 4 humans comfortably inside. At a certain point I recall a small panel on the inferior-anterior edge of the saucer slide open and some sort of camera like cone shaped obect come out and pointed it at us, almost like it was observing our actions.  My Dad said to stay put and keep an eye on it while he went into the house to telephone some friends.  Ater a few seconds of finding myself alone with this floating disk I got scared and ran into the house. When we came back out the disk was gone and I was very disappointed. I don't exactly know the exact time and Month when this occured but I born in 1964 and I was six at the time so the year was 1970. I remember wearing a t-shirt so it was either late summer or maybe during a warm spell in Fall. Over the years I would every now and again mention it to my Dad if what we saw was real and he said yes it was. I'm sorry to say that my Dad died last year but I today I have found your website and this is why I am writing to you in order to remind me that it was true what we saw that afternoon. My Father was a very successful M.D. and I too am a M.D. This  experience has stayed with me forever. I did do some research maybe a couple of years after I saw it but I never found anything. I guess at the time I was too young. We never mentioned it to anyone except to family and very close friends for fear of being considered crazy. Thank you very much for the opportunity in giving my eyewittness account that was much overdue ! With regards Frank C.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Saucer/disklike craft, with multi-colored lights sighted in Bayridge Brooklyn in 1970 with many eyewitnesses.;1970-10-01 21:00:00;5 mins;Saucer/disklike craft, with multi-colored lights sighted in Bayridge Brooklyn in 1970 with many eyewitnesses. During an evening in early fall, when I was ten, I was outdoors playing on the sidewalk in front of our storefront apartment on 8th Avenue and 47th Street in Brooklyn, New York with some girlfriends. The avenue was bustling with people and motorists. A passenger bus was approaching....suddenly a humming sound caused us to look upwards towards the night sky. A strange lighted object shot down very fast and hovered across the street from my home above some buildings. It reminded me of the saucer from Lost in Space...the craft with very bright and colored lights went clockwise. As the saucer turned its angle a bottom set of colored lights shone displaying a smaller disk which was attached and the lights were going in a counterclockwise motion. The saucer (or disk) remained hovering for about 1 min. Suddenly it shot out into the sky and disappeared completely. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Glowing, bi-convex, disc-shaped craft cruised up the canyons of Manhattan in daylight for all to see.;1974-06-30 18:30:00;15 minutes;Glowing, bi-convex, disc-shaped craft cruised up the canyons of Manhattan in daylight for all to see. Ninth Avenue UFO Incident New York City Summer 1974 The Complete Story    I am an accomplished artist (painter) and actor (theatre and film) who has worked with Rod Steiger, Burt Reynolds, Peter Boyle, John Turturro and Dennis Farina among many others.  This is the story behind a UFO event that occurred in New York City during the summer of 1974.  It was totally blacked-out on the TV news and not reported (to the best of my knowledge) in the press at the time.  This event may well be one of the biggest cover-ups in the history of UFO sightings.  This was not just some distant light in the sky, but an actual bi-convex craft, with an insignia on it, that came down and slowly (about 45 miles per hour), with multi-colored lights blinking in what appeared to be programmed sequences, literally cruised up the canyons of Manhattan in daylight for all to see.  I was working at the time for Joe Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theatre.  I was helping to build and decorate sets for various productions.  We were doing &quotPericles&quot and &quotMerry Wives of Windsor&quot up in Central Park at the Delacorte Theatre there.  I believe it was toward the end of June or the beginning of July.  I wrote the exact dates down at the time, but I have been unable to find the paper with them on as this happened many years ago and I assume it has been lost or thrown out by accident.  I was asked to take a load of costumes downtown that needed last minute alterations.  We loaded them into the Festival van and I drove out of the park and headed down Columbus Avenue which turns into Ninth Avenue farther down.  As I headed downtown at about 6:30 pm, I noticed what appeared to be very bright lights of some sort, way downtown, perhaps in the 20s or 30s.  I thought it might be a large neon sign or something for a store opening or maybe a movie premiere of some sort.  As I got to the 60s near Lincoln Center I could tell that the lights were moving and coming closer up the avenue.  As it got closer and closer, I couldn't believe what I was then able to see.  It was a craft of some kind, very high tech-looking, heading directly for me.  It was just above the tops of five-story buildings on the avenue and it spanned the width of the entire street  It was circular in shape, but tilted up slightly so it looked like an ellipse.  The convex bottom was glowing a bright, iridescent greenish-yellow, almost like neon, with a Saturn-like rectangular shaped circular band, around the circumference of the craft, of bright green, which had small multi-colored lights (red, yellow, blue, etc.) set in it.  The band protruded from the craft all the way around.  The lights were blinking in what appeared to be programmed sequences.  There were two large, very bright, red, beacon-like lights (one on each side of the craft), oval in shape (horizontally), which extended from the green circular band.  They were flashing on and off somewhat slowly, almost like a pulse.  I kept saying to myself, &quotWhat the hell is that?!!&quot  I just could not believe what I was actually seeing.  I don't remember feeling any fear, though, because it looked so beautiful and non-threatening.  And the blinking lights were moving in such pleasing patterns that they made me feel happy (perhaps that was their intended effect).  I had the distinct feeling that they (whoever &quotthey&quot were) were having some fun and just saying, &quotHi!&quot  There was an insignia on the bottom of the craft, on the curved part toward the front, not the exact middle of the bottom, which appeared to be recessed in the yellow made of thick black lines.  I believe it was composed of three symbols, almost like a logo.  I had never seen anything like them before.  They looked like a foreign alphabet or symbol system of some kind as the craft passed directly over me as I drove beneath it, nearing the Lincoln Tunnel, in the 50s.  Many other people saw it.  I could see people standing on the sidewalks looking and staring up at it.  The sky was still light at that hour, so I could see it wasn't being held up by a helicopter or something like that.  This was certainly not a blimp or a balloon of some kind.  It looked solid and real.  It was still rush-hour and there was a lot of traffic trying to get out of the city through the tunnel, so I couldn't stop, and I also had only about an hour to get the costumes taken care of and get back up to the theatre in time for the opening.  I didn't think they would take it well if the show was late going up and the reason I gave was that I had seen a UFO on Ninth Avenue!  I figured that this incident would be all-over the news when I got home.  Later that evening, I rushed home thinking that this was big news and that they would probably even be pre-empting the regular shows to cover it.  When I got home I flipped on the TV and channel surfed around the dial, but there was nothing out of the ordinary.  I remember thinking that was very strange and decided to wait for the 11:00 o'clock news.  Again, at 11:00, there was only the usual local news, weather and sports.  Nothing about the UFO, not even a denial, anywhere.  I thought maybe they were trying to figure out how to deal with it and were delaying coverage.  So, I went to bed thinking I'll check the newspapers early in the morning because this has got to be front page headline stuff.  When I awoke, I went down to the corner newsstand and checked the first few pages of several main newspapers -- there was nothing at all about it.  Unless there was a small blurb in the back pages, but I doubt it. This started to instill some fear and paranoia in me, because I then realized that the government could totally censor and block or kill a story.  And I always had believed we had a free press -- but after this I certainly didn't believe that anymore.  A few days later I was eating lunch near the prop department down at the Public Theatre when a gal I knew who worked in the department came in.  She had almost straight, longish, light-blond, slightly reddish hair and freckles, and looked somewhat ethereal -- a very pretty gal.  I said to her, &quotYou're not going to believe what I saw fly up Ninth Avenue the other evening.&quot  Her face went ashen and she blurted, &quotI know what you're talking about, I saw it, too!&quot  She said she had been shopping for props for &quotWives&quot and had just come out of a store on West 57th Street between Eighth and Ninth, and that she and a couple of hundred other people saw it go by as it headed up the avenue.  We discussed it a bit, and she said she had seen exactly the same craft as I had seen.  I asked her if there was anything in the newspapers about it, but she said, no, she didn't see anything.  And then she started to get a bit freaked-out and said, &quotI can't talk a! bout this anymore.  I don't want to talk about it.  I won't talk about it.  I don't want to continue this discussion.&quot  She then abruptly rushed out of the room in a somewhat agitated state.  Probably because the reality of it, and what it implied, had just really sunk in. I can't remember her name now, but I think it was Jane something -- but I can't say for sure.  I intend, at some point, to check with the Festival for a list of people that worked in props that summer and see if I can locate her.  I now believe beyond any doubt whatsoever that UFOs are real.  I know that they're here, because I've seen them up-close -- and I know what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

1976 Sighting - 2 disks over NY city.;1976-09-10 22:00:00;15 Minutes;1976 Sighting - 2 disks over NY city. This sighting happened when I was ten years old, my apartment window faced south towards the landing pattern of Laguardia airport in NY.  I was used to seeing the planes land at night and was familiar with the slow approaches from the south and the west to east patterns of planes landing.  I was also familiar with the airplanes turning in the final approach to the airport at night.   What I witnessed or thought I did was a disk shaped object with illuminated window panels and blinking red and blue lights on the outer edge of the object traveling east.  At first I thought it to be a blimp traveling west to east or an advertising plane - I had also seen these at night.  What struck me as strange was the speed, sort of a slow deliberate and perpendicular path that was too straight.  I witnessed this and thought the distance to be at least a half mile away which would make the object huge.   From my vantage point the object moved slowly and did not produce the jet sounds that I could make out from that distance that airplanes usually made.  I still thought it was a single blimp until it reached the far eastern edge of my view and another similar object entered my view from the east but moving in a gyroscopic fashion - at the same plane of the horizon and perpendicular direction.   I became excited as the first object stopped dead still and seemed to wait as the second object approached from the west.  It was too much for me to believe and I watched for several minutes (about three) before I left the window to get some water and regroup.   I returned to the window and to my surprise both of the objects had left the area, I remained watching for a long time but did not see them again.   This has been bugging me for over 25 years, want to know for sure. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

AT 10 PM I  was awoken from sleep by a humming noise.  I looked out of my bedroom window that faced south toward the Rockaways and saw this huge saucer about 100 feet from me hovering over my neighbors house.  I was twelve at the time and thought I was going nuts, but I could not move I was totally entranced and woke up the next day like a had the most surreal dream I have ever had in my life.  I did not tell my parents or my sister Lucille I just let it go, I figured they would all just laugh.  On 7/1 I was awoken again but when I heard the noise I ran to Lucille's room so I had a witness.  She thought I was nuts, but when she looked she stood there in amazement and just like me she woke up and told me her dream.  I said that was no dream that was for real.  We told our parents who called us nuts and checked us to see if we were green.  To date that is one thing me and her hold sacred, we may fight and not speak, but we never will deny the proof of UFO's.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

In 1979 or 1980 our Dad called me and my sister to run and witness this bronzey gold color saucer shaped craft.  It had yellowish looking windows around the center and it was a lighted craft.  It was heading from Manhattan towards  Bay Parkway or Coney Island.  I was on my fifth floor balcony.  It was silent and very much visable.  The night was clear.  I think it was Aug. or Sept. because it was a little nippy outside but not time enough to stay off the balcony yet due to the comming Winter.  The craft was spotted about 1 to 2 min. it was lost behind some buildings.  I lived on Ocean Parkway. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Walking home in Manhattan summer 1982 we witnessed a huge brightly lit disc hovering over us.;1982-07-01 20:00:00;5 seconds;Walking home in Manhattan summer 1982 we witnessed a huge brightly lit disc hovering over us. One evening, at the age of 4 (summer 1982), my Mom came to visit me at the babysitters' (near 106th and Park Ave, NY). She wanted to go to the store so the two of us walked about 2 blocks over to the local bodega. We were walking back and for some reason, I caught myself looking down at the ground. I remembered being told not to look down, and so I shifted my eyes to the horizon. It did occur to me to not only look at the horizon, but to check out the stars while I was at it. We were crossing the street, and I looked straight up as far as I could see. Suddenly, I tugged at my mother's hand and pulled her further into the street Look, Look! I shouted as she pulled back on me. What I saw in that moment was a HUGE metal disk with bright lights all over it. It was suddenly hovering right over us. You could not see the sky it was so close. When she looked up, she yanked me back with the most chilling grasp, close to her waistline. I can still hear the desparate breath she took. Once I shouted look and was yanked back, I noticed everyone in the street stopped and was staring up at the sky. Once I looked back up again, it was gone, and everyone started walking again as if nothing had happened. The next day, when I went outside I heard nothing of the incident from adults. I knew of the news at the time, but was too young to understand what time it came on t.v.  Years had passed and I never forgot what happened, but as I aged I began to question if it was a dream. My mom and I had never discussed it after that night. I approached her one day and asked her if it was true we had seen a UFO. She sounded annoyed and said Yes! (she is not fond of such topics). I told her I did not beleive her, she was just trying to appease me, and asked her to recount her story. Here is what she said: I looked up and saw the UFO and lights, I was scared so I pulled you closer. I told her that when she pulled me closer, I looked around at everyone else looking up. I asked her what happened in that moment because when i looked back up the ufo was gone. The UFO ascended into the air, and sped off, like a bright white light, it just disappeared. It went up and out. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I immediately nudged by friend and we both stopped and stared at the object for about 15 seconds. The disk made no sound and was motionless. The disk then flew away at a high speed towards Central Park leaving a steaking light behind it. ((NUFORC Note:  Year is approximate.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I knew it wasnt a plane because it was way to low.I looked up to see what kind of helicopter was coming,but what i seen was no helicopter.  It was about a hundred feet in the air moving very slowly.  I was right under it.  It was like an octagon shape with lights surronding it.  It must have been over a hundred feet wide.  I compared it to the building it was flying over.  It continued to move slow until it passed us across the street from the corner we were on.  It started to hover over a tree on the other corner across the street.  Then all of a sudden it just beemed straight up into the sky and vanished.I ve never seen anything move so fast it must have been faster than a blink.  I looked at my friend and I knew he seen it too by the paleness and open mouth, because I had that same look.  The other guy is looking at us funny and says whats wrong with you guys, you look like you seen a ghost!  We both shouted at the same time did you not see that?  The tree is now dead I think.

I was walking home from work, it was a very clear day out. And just over a building,  about 4 stories high, I saw this object. It was  mettalic colored and it had flashing lights on the bottom of it. I can't quite recall the color of the lights, but I remember lights flashing. It was just hovering there for what seemed about 5-7 seconds. I froze, almost like I couldn't move even if I wanted to! Walking behind me, was a man in a 3 piece suit with a briefcase. So I turned and asked him did you just see that?  But he acted as if I wasn't even there. Like he didn't see me! By the time I turned around to see the UFO, it was gone. I mean GONE! As I mentioned earlier, there were no clouds in the sky at all that day. So where could it have gone in the half a second that I turned to talk to that man? And how could something that was just hovering, build up that kind of speed so quickly? I kept walking home, not taking my eyes off the sky. I remember being very frightened.  Like when you think you've seen a ghost. When I walked in the door, my cousin said I was very pale. The 1st thing she and her husband said was you look like you've seen a ghost! I don't drink or do drugs! So I know that I saw something that day! I just can't understand why that man didn't it, or ME at that!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Of the two, one flew perfectly in its curved destiation, but the other on the outside flew too and fro of the other. I followed these objects until they were out of my sight. I feel they were at apx. 4000 ft. and traveling at apx. 400 to 500 mph. That evening I was tempted to go to my roof with my binocilars, not to look for UFO's, but to look at the Barn Owls that were nesting a few blocks from my house. As I did not see any Owls that afternoon, I decided to lay down and watch the sky. within seconds what appeared to be the same two objects came into the view of my binoculars. As most people know, you can not keep a steady view of objects flying high and at a fast speed. I continued to watch them for apx. another ten seconds until they were out of my view.

I was on my way to the supermarket and while crossing the street I noticed two round and white objects coming fron the north/ne. Both objects were perfectly round and traveling paraelle with each other. I have been a sky watcher for thirty years and can honestly say that I have never seen anything out of the ordinary. This day was an exception. The objects moved at the same speed, but the one on the outside was moving infront of and then inback of the other. There where two women crossin the same street as I, but when I called out to them to look at the objects, they did not hear me. I must also mention that both objects where traveling nnw to a easterly direction. The objects seem to be at approximatly 3,500 ft. and moving at apx. 500 mph. and curved into an easterly direction and were gone in a matter of ten seconds. The story does not end there! Later that day I went onto my roof with my binoculars to check out the birds in the area and also to look at the aircraft that pass over my house, being that the LaGuardia flight way passes over my building and the airport is just a five minute flight to the airport. As I trained my binoculars onto the sky, I once again had the same two objects come into view of my binoculars. It was only a second or two, but I was able to get a good look at the two objects. This time they were also coming from the nne and heading west. They were the exact same objects, but this time moving faster and both equally at the same speed. They both were gone in a matter on seconds. I now believe that UFO's are for real!  Sinserly,  ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports submitted by same witness.

Nothing more was said but the last two days (Oct. 8 and 9th) in Las Vegas, NV while viewing Telemundo, a major Spanish speaking channel, there has been much airing of the footage, actually extended over what what shown during the day of the event.  This time it was being commented on in Spanish and shown on the screen was the object, a disk shaped, silverish object, quite large, seemingly the size of a couple of busses seen to be hovering between the towers, after the first airplane hit, but before the first tower collapsed and before the second airplane crashed.  The footage was being shot from a close by helicopter and narrated in English by a female newscaster. She pointed out the object to the cameraman with a startled look over there, what is that.  The cameraman's comment was much more graphic, such as what the **** is that?!  He filmed it for a few seconds and then the disk shot out from between the buildings and directly towards them.  The woman sounds like she is exclaiming, screaming slightly and the camera guy says something and actually leans back and films from a reclining angle as the object careens rapidly up and past them.  This footage has been aired several times and each time seeing it it's quite startling.  My original comment to the kids before seeing it was that it must be some kind of secret surveillance craft that we have and don't want anyone to know about but upon viewing it, one just can't believe that we have such a capacity.  I've seen the comments from around the world of people who viewed something like this and would like to have this investigated.  Is there some sort of news blackout that has prevented this particular shot from being re-aired in the U.S.  Interestingly today it was announced that Sony is buying this network.  Maybe the type of freely decided upon ! news for mat will be curtailed.  Hope not, because this is really happening and people deserve to have some sort of explanation - if only to be told that the government is aware of, or acknowledging this as real. We typically don't watch this channel, but our son does at times. We've had the video tape in since then, to record this footage if it airs again, but it must be public record somewhere that your agency can investigate.  My husband even advised me not to write because it was so frightening.  Any comments?;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I was looking out the window at the sky towards the west when I saw a silver disk hovering stationary in the sky and reflecting the morning sun.  It didn't move or wobble at any time but just hovered in one spot.  It was very high up, I would guess above 10,000 feet or more because there were passenger jets above it to the left and right (southwest & northwest).  It looked like it was part of the sky.  It was hovering without any movement in the same spot.  After watching it for about 15 seconds as it hovered, and without looking away, it disappeared.  Just like that.  It was no where to be seen.  It looked about the size of an air rifle pellet held at arms length.  The reflection on its surface from the morning sun made it stand out against the white clouds behind it.  (I've seen jets at night approaching and facing me that look like one big light head on, until they turn into their landing pattern and you see the landing lights).  Again this sighting was at 8:40 a.m. in the morning with the back drop of the sky full of white clouds and other air traffic in the vicinity.  It resembled the Mexico city OVNI's and looked sort of hat shaped.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Invading Laguardia's Air Space.;2003-04-16 11:00:00;15 secs.;Invading Laguardia's Air Space. On this day I had two encounters with these same objects. The first was in the late morning and the second in late afternoon. The morning sighting was as follows: I was on my way down my street when I looked up to the NE and spotted two identical ojects that were round and white flying side by side. One would pull ahead and then fall back. It did this a few time until both were again side by side and continued in a southerly direction. There altitude was apx. 1000 ft. and they were apx. 30 ft. in diameter. My second sighting was in late afternoon while on my roof. Due to the earlier sighting I brought my binoculars. I was looking NNE when the same two ojects came into my field of vison. I put down the binoculars to get a better look since they were moving much faster then the first sighting, also they looked to be at apx. 1500 to 2000 ft. They slowly went into a westerly curve and were gone in seconds. These objects were not birds, weather ballons or any other objects I have seen in the sky during my lifetime. Also I may add that I live below the flight path for commerical aircraft 5 mins. from landing at Laguardia Airport.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
A friend and I saw a round domed object metallic in appearance and rather large with lights located around the bottom edges and top.;2003-06-28 23:12:00;6 minutes;A friend and I saw a round domed object metallic in appearance and rather large with lights located around the bottom edges and top. While driving down Flatlands in Brooklyn I noticed an object hovering straight ahead, normally I would not have paid a flying object any mind because we see helicopters and planes all the time, however this object was noticable because of its shape, it was round with what I can only describe as a domed top, furthermore this object was not high up like an airplane but only several stories it was low enough that details could be made out.  It had a metallic appearance with lights located around the bottom along the edge, these lights were between purple and blue in color and there was also a pulsating yellowish light located between the round bottom of the craft and its round domed top. I looked at it for several seconds trying to make out what I was seeing before I tapped my boyfriend and said do you see that, I should mention that I have never believed in aliens, or bigfoot or anything of the sort I am a graduate student majoring in forensic science and have always been taught there is an explanation for everything, he looked up got quiet for a few seconds and said oh my god, what the hell is that. We continued to drive north and the craft simply hovered there, the night was clear and silent and we both noticed that whatever it was it emitted no noise, we continued driving and the object began to travel north but at a slow pace. My boyfriend began to feel uneasy about this round object which was most definitely not a plane or a helicopter or any other flying object either of us had ever seen before and turned right, at this point we were traveling east but were still looking back at the odject, maybe 4-5 minutes had passed by this point. Now we had to look back and to the left to keep the object in focus, at this point the object began to tavel in our direction rather rapidly however it was now slightly tilted with the bottom turned toward us, the closer it got the larger it appeared and the more detail we could make out (at this point the object was only about 2 blocks from us,) we co! uld not understand how those around us could not see this, it was so close, but the drivers around us did not appear to be looking in the direction of this craft which could easily be seen by looking through the back seat window on the driver's side but rather straight ahead.  At this point the craft was traveling behind a set of buildings, once again I commented on how low it was, it wasn't flying over the buildings but behind them so that its view would be blocked for about half a second everytime it went behind a building,( the buildings were apartments I estimate to be about 15-20 stories high)the object suddenly took off in the opposite direction and we lost sight of it.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

This sighting happened at the Howard Beach Subway Station at JFK Airport. JFK is located in the southeastern section of Queens County, New York City, on Jamaica Bay. It is fifteen miles by highway from midtown Manhattan. Geographic reference points are 40° 38' 28.5 north, 73° 46' 41.9 west. There was a saucer shaped object with the usual half sphere middle part 3 rows of 8 or 10 windows. It was emitting a gloomy white light/haze all over it and a blinking sharp white light from the bottom. It was hovering low in the horizon. It stayed in one position approx 300 meters high then moved slowly to the right while lowering itself. Then came back to its original position but much closer to the ground and got out of sight because covered by a building. Might have landed. We were four of us. Other people also saw it from a JFK between terminals bus but did not pay too much attention. We have just got back to NY and looked up on the sky as getting off the bus and going into the subway station. IT WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE. Several airplanes went by paying no attention to it altough they must have seen it. No chasing. I followed its movements in the parking lot and saw it time to time covered by the trees. At the very first sight we knew we had never seen anything like that on the sky before. Somehow a very nice relaxing feeling over the excitement of the unusual sight.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

My dad was on the roof of our building and he saw a weird object flying on the sky, he used his cell to call me and told me to go up to the roof. Our building is located at midtown manhattan and when i went up we saw a light blue disk with a dome. it was somewhat tilted about 30 degrees and there was a small blinking red light on the bottom. it moved steadily and slowly from left to right above the river and then it went behind the building so we lost sight of it. my dad saw it first so i am not sure how long it stayed on air but i probably spent 4 min looking at it.  it could very well be a blimp because it was pretty big but i have doubts because it didnt have any writings on it, it had a disk shape, it was tilted, and it was lit up in a weird way--glowing in blue. if it was lit up like that its hard to believe why they dont put advertizing on it.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Initially I thought it was one of those helium filled ballons that drift away from some kids party, until I noticed it seemed to be be higher than the clouds and wasn't moving.  I watched for the next 5-7 minutes as it maintained its position.  When I got home I told my wife I had seen a UFO and she asked if I had stopped at a bar on my way home again.  I go out after about 5 minutes to have another look, and to my shock there were now two of them but now they were moving.  They seemed to create this shimmering effect as the moved across the sky heading North.  I forgot all about it until I followed a link to this site while browsing the web and saw someone else had seen something similar the previous day.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Dark, silent cylinder/worm shape over NYC the night of the eclipse;2003-11-08 20:30:00;~1 minute;Dark, silent cylinder/worm shape over NYC the night of the eclipse I'm a sailor, and a skeptic, so this is the first thing of this type I've seen, but I can't explain it. I was on the roof of my apartment building in Little Italy the night of the eclipse, just ten minutes past the maximum eclipse, and watching through my binoculars. I had propped my elbows on a rooftop ventilator to hold the binocs steady--when I suddenly saw, coming into the left of my field of view and holding an absolutely straight lateral line, a very dark object, cylinder-shaped (really it was more like a segmented caterpillar, with bumps). It was tilted at an angle of about 30 degrees to the horizon, and held that attitude. What the heck is that??? I wondered, and followed it with my binoculars, thinking that I'd see it better when it crossed in front of the moon. But it did not cross in front of the moon--it disappeared then reappeared on the other side! which was really mind-blowing, and rules out aircraft, flights of geese, loose helium balloons, and any other hypothesis I can think of. Also, it stayed at exactly the same 30-degree angle, Very dark against the night sky, no nav lights or any other kind of lights. Utterly silent. It wasn't something on the lens of the binoculars, either, because it moved independently. I took the binocs down to try to see with my naked eye, but couldn't see it, then couldn't find it again. I don't even believe in these things, so the joke's on me.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I just got a brand new camera - Nikon D70 with a 400mm lens - and started using it on the boardwalk of Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, N.Y. I was taking a lot of pictures of the sea, sand, sky, birds, and so on. After filling up the memory card with a lot of practice shots I took, I went home and transfered all my images. It then happened, where my dad and I notice a white speck at the upper right portion of a shot I took at a bird that was flying over the sea. I zoomed in on the image, and my hair on my body stood up. I don't know, but it seems to be something. I knew it can't be a bird because it was a shot that I took at distance, and a bird would not stand out that big from a long distance shot. I knew it couldn't be dust or something right in front of my camera, because the image is too far. The picture was during the day time, so I don't think it would have been a star or something. Later on during the day, I went to another venue to practice soccer. In this park, I sat on the bench with my dad, and we were talking about the clouds. It so happend to be, that we saw something white in the sky again. It was day time also. I didn't get a chance to take a picture of it, because clouds began to cover it up. I don't know what we saw, but it is very mysterious.  Thanks;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Then upon passing by my building and a few more, it stopped and hovered, then turned a semi circle to the right. I freaked at this point because it was going against the wind.  The object then resumed course away from me and I was at risk of loosing sight of it so I ran up to the roof to watch it. It was gone upon my arrival and I stayed for maybe 10 minutes looking for it. I returned downstairs to my deck. Upon return I looked all around and over to the right about 2 blocks down the object was back paralleled with my building and moving east bound again. Meaning, it had circled back, gotten behind me and down the street, and resumed a straight course while I was in transit from the roof. Unless it was another object. If so it was identical. Ive been watching for the past hour and have seen nothing else.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Shinny sliver and black saucer shape moving very fast in bright blue sky -;2007-07-20 19:00:00;45 seconds;Shinny sliver and black saucer shape moving very fast in bright blue sky - Bright blue sky, moon very clear - I was sitting on my porch around 7:30 with my cats, and was looking up at the moon when I noticed this object moving very fast and appeared to be spinning while moving - I got up ran into my house to get my camera – when I got outside again, it was much further away and I just couldn’t get it into my frame, but I tried.  The image that sticks in my mind the most is when I first saw it I really focused in on it to make sure it wasn’t a balloon. It looked like a shinny sliver color with black on top. A saucer type shape it was moving at the same level in the sky, not rising or sinking, but very fast and then it was out of my view with my camera dangling from my neck.  The spinning motion view I had only lasted about 7 seconds because it was moving away from my direction. It was moving East towards long Island. I stayed outside another half hour just looking up into the sky, but nothing came back.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Large flying object that was going extremely fast.;2008-01-31 07:30:00;night;Large flying object that was going extremely fast. I was outside feeding my horses.  When i heard i noise, I looked outside to see what it was and there was a circular object moving at speeds I have never seen before. (miles with in 15 seconds)  There was only one small white light that was not blinking.  The object was just over the tree tops, I thought that it was going to hit the trees or my barn.  It didn't have anyway of seeing, there was only a small little white light on what looked to be the bottom.   When it passed through, I heard it when it was only about 50 f.t. away.  It passed over me so fast that i couldn't get a good look at it.   I went around my barn in the direction it was coming from and it was almost 2 miles away.  Then when it went over the mountains the was a very bright light coming from were it had went above the mountain.   Then there were 2 planes that came a minute or so apart from each other and 2 or so minutes from when I had lost sight to the object.   I do not know if the other planes had anything to do with what I thought was a UFO.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

We were talking about airplanes and military wepons as we walked. just an average day really. a few minutes after we started we notieced a group of peaple standing nere the beach. It was about 10-15 peaple in this group. then when we asked why they were standing their they said they saw multiple disk shaped crafts flying threw the clouds. I imideatly thought it was just the air force testing new air crafts like the insedint in Roswell. but then when I took a look for a few minutes. Just before I got sick of it I noticed some flashes. Then when the clouds cleared the flashes grew brighter and brighter. before long I noticed a disk shape and saw the silouete of the craft. there was about 4 or 5 of these crafts, I was'nt sure how many because they were disapearing and reapearing threw the sky. I could'nt tell how large they were or how far away they were. the colors of the flashing lights were white and vilet. they were moving very quicky. Im an athiest so I dont beleve in God, Ghost or Aliens. I was speachless. there were about 2 or 3 smaller oness around this much larger one. for about 20 minutes they were like this. than a flash upove the crafts made all of them dissapear. After they were gone, we walked home talking about extraterestrials and UFOs. I explained to him Roswell and Area 51. later I got on the computer and found this website and read some reports. than I filed this report.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

The duration was few seconds (10-15) only as it was so fast and close to where we were standing.It was shaped like a Disc but hazy i.e. not a solid object. It could not be a ferry, speedboat, shadow of a plane, water wave, water current or my Imagination - Because my friend said what the F was that. I looked up to look for a plane, but anyone in NYC knows it has been gray & cloudy eliminating any light source, no boat could flew by without obvious appearance or without water trail, waves etc. It was an amazing experience, I don't know what it was but it was an Un-Identified object for sure. i am pretty educated and scientific person, and would not believe anything until I would see anything with my own fair eyes.

Cloud-like saucer moving over Manhattan early morning 9/9/10;2010-09-09 00:31:00;2-3 minutes;Cloud-like saucer moving over Manhattan early morning 9/9/10 A little after midnight this morning (9/9/10), my wife and I were on our balcony which hangs over the Hudson River in Weehawken, NJ.  We were looking at the Manhattan skyline right across the river (approx. 38th street) just North of Empire State Building.  The night sky was completely empty of clouds, but I noticed what originally looked like a cloud moving North to South across the NYC skyline. It looked to be only a few hundred feet over the tops of the highest buildings.  It was moving with more speed than I have seen a cloud move but slower than the speed I usually see helicopters move at over the city.  There was very little if any wind. Although it had a greyish/white cloud-like look, it was formed in a somewhat distinct shape...close to what the hokey UFO saucers are depicted as.  I watched as it crossed behind the highest building in my direct line of sight and it seemed to either dissolve or head away from me (toward the EAST) rather than continue along! the same North to South route it had been on.  The entire sighting lasted about 2-3 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

UFO in New York. We have photos and Details, the object was no doubt a UFO.;2011-05-28 22:00:00;10-15 Minutes;UFO in New York. We have photos and Details, the object was no doubt a UFO. I was walking my girlfriend home after an AMAZING DAY.  It was around 9 or 10:00 at night when we were in this deserted street, I looked up and saw this object, it was a bit fuzzy because it looked like the moon behind some clouds.  Thing is, there was no clouds in the sky, so after a while of staring at it i point at it for my girlfriend could see.  She immediately said it was a UFO, but i was questioning it.  First, i saw a Blue light (which i thought was the clouds) illiminating all around it.  It had the classic UFO shape, you know, sort of like an oblate spheroid.   This is what i saw:  It had a classic UFO shape A bright blue light illuminating it a smaller red lighting under the center and it was actually relively close for us to judge that it was not a plane.  There were many planes flying around us because there's an airport near by.  But living in New York you can tell what's a plane and what's not.  This definetly wasn't. I started naming things it CAN be. I thought it was a hellicopter. Because of the bright light. But what canceled it out is   1.  If a search helicopter was out, the lights wouldn't have been around it, and the chopper would've been smaller 2.  If it was a larger chopper, it could possibly be that shape at a distance, but not from this distance 3.  The object was moving VERY slow, almost still, and kept at the same altitude  We watched and walked for 10 minutes or so and it was actually following us, very slowly.  There was this point where we were walking but keeping an eye where a building go in the way, we speed walked passed it and in that time (about 5 seconds) it was already in front of us.  It amazing us because it was going soo slow, but randomly zooms passed us.   We kept watching and i noticed the red light, it would blink not too often.  Also if it were a plane,  1.  It'll blink repeatedly  2.  It would definitely not be as bright as that.  We watched more, till it got smaller, like it was moving away, we watched till it fell behind some tree's and it was gone, we then saw it about 5 minutes later for a few seconds then lost it again. What's really got me is the bright blue light around it.  It truthfully looked like a force field or energy wall.  It was truly amazing, i really never believed in aliens but this is getting me to question it. P.S my girlfriend had taken pictures, it's very legit;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Two UFO sightings while looking at and from the Statue Of Liberty.;2012-03-07 23:20:00;20min;Two UFO sightings while looking at and from the Statue Of Liberty. Wednesday March 7th.  My 3 year old couldn’t sleep, I was showing him what the Statue of Liberty was.  We were looking at Presidential Dollars and he asked if the picture on the reverse was god, I said no, and tried to explain what it was.  Then it hit me I could show him a picture. After a couple links I stumbled on http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/statueofliberty/?cam=liberty_torch I found it amazing that you can view NY through a live feed from Liberty’s Torch. After I started panning around at aprox 11:15 pm I noticed a floating light above the city.  I had caught it while it was on the left hand side of the panoramic view.  The light was white, solid & rectangular the length of the light iliminated any possibility of an air craft.  I’ve never seen anything in that shape so clear and uniform. I had to capture what I was seeing and remembered that I downloaded a plugin where you can capture screen shots.  I’d yet to use it but thought this would be the perfect time. My first attempt at taking the screen capture got screwed up from lack of use.  And bye the time I made it back to the web site and back to the live feed looking out the torch into NY.  The light had moved a considerable distance, and now was three ¼’s across the panoramic screen and much further away.  Now its 11:20pm but this time I was able to capture the light with a screen capture.   You can still make out the odd shape of the light and still have a pretty good view ! when zooming in. But the next thing I saw is really amazing! When looking directly at the Statue of Liberty in full frontal view.  A long object can easily be seen with multiple color lights just off the right side of Lady Liberty and extending all the way out of the shot.  The placement of the object can’t be horizon lights or anything like that.  And I just checked the live cameras during the day to double check, and nothing is visible.  And the great thing is I was able to take two pictures of the object. If I was to guess what I was looking at I’d say it was a large oval but flattened shaped fly saucer and I was seeing the side that  was closest to me, and when you zoom in on the picture it does appear to confirm these thoughts.  I’ve got multiple pictures that allow you to zoom in and can send them to whom ever, I hope they come out right when I post this.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

The helicoper and the unidentified noise were very different.  The unidentified sound was louder and like a pulsing siren, a siren with low bass. Description - At this point i went to look out of my window.  Slightly above the building directly across from me was a line of slowly flashing lights from left to right.  The body of the craft wasnt visible but the lights were in a perfect line like a disk shape.  These lights flashed blue and red.

Saucer Shaped Object Seen Near George Washington Bridge NYC;2013-04-20 17:00:00;4 minutes;Saucer Shaped Object Seen Near George Washington Bridge NYC I was driving back to CT and about 1 mile from the George Washington Bridge in NYC. I looked up while I was idling in heavy traffic. To my left I saw a perfect flying saucer shaped object, wobbling and rotating to the left of my passenger side.  It was very high up but could be seen plainly as a classic flying saucer. I watched it for about a minute as I idled in traffic that was standing still for quite awhile.  I continued to watch it over a 2-3 minute period, it just kept hovering and wobbling and rotating. As I drove forward about 5 MPH for abit, I was able to continue to watch it.  It stayed in the same area the whole time, hovering and spinning.  It was slate grey color.  I noticed typical aircraft, jets, etc. flying toward or away from one of the airports...this saucer object was much lower than the aircraft I saw in their flight pattern.  The object was possibly 200 feet above the highway. ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I found this strange, because I was thinking that nothing could fly over New York since 09/11.  To check if it was a helicopter from the police or the army (it was during the Memorial week) I took a picture and when I looked at it, I was a bit surprised to see something looking like a rose flying donut. I don’t know what is was, probably just an advertising donut balloon ???  5 to 10 seconds later (necessary time to look at the first picture), I decided to take another one but the flying object had disappeared.

It shot out a white light that was a beam of light the light didn't spread like a spotlight would that's why I say beam.  The white beam went into the Hudson River.

Oscillating black-ish/gray spherical object hovering in ther sky and disappeared.;2014-08-10 22:00:00;1 minute;Oscillating black-ish/gray spherical object hovering in ther sky and disappeared Last night, my 3 friends and I were on the roof in Manhattan.  We had a few bottles of wine, so we were a little warm, but not incoherent.  It was bright out because of the supermoon, so we had a clear view.   My friend, who pointed in the air, then told us to look.  3 of the 4 of us saw what looked like a thick blackish-gray disc, hovering in the air a few hundred feet out.  It was not a plane, because we had seen many moving around that night.   I thought it was a balloon floating up but my friend and I stood up and approached the edge of the rooftop to get a better view and I quickly ruled that out.  What I personally saw was something that looked large enough to not be a balloon, and it was definitely oscillating.  It made no sound, but I did not expect it to at our distance.   I rationalized at first it was a balloon floating from the light into the atmosphere and thus disappearing, but something was off about that idea.  However, as I approached it went from a darker color to gray, and then disappeared almost as if backing away.   We all 3 were very creeped out and thought it was a drone or definitely a UFO.   Still thinking about it, but it moved so quickly away once I approached it, I couldn’t really process things.   Anyway, definitely saw a UFO last night and first time I have ever posted something like this.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Two saucer shaped crafts moving at high rates of speed and stopping suddenly near Brooklyn, NY.;2019-12-23 18:00:00;5 minutes;Two saucer shaped crafts moving at high rates of speed and stopping suddenly near Brooklyn, NY. Early evening of Friday the 23rd my girlfriend and I were walking our dog towards the east river in Brooklyn Heights, when we spotted a red light flying unlike any other aircraft we’ve ever seen.  It moved at a high rate of speed, low in the sky, but above the planes and helicopters taking off from local airports.  First one craft was spotted as it moved extremely fast and then stopped on a dime, hovering, and then descended slowly in the sky, to then stop and hover again.  Multiple red and white lights, and one green light appearing and disappearing in very peculiar patterns unlike any traditional aircraft lights that flash on and off.  We located another one in the sky moving in the same pattern with one green light. As the first craft moved very slowly in the sky coming closer to our location you could see the red lights on the craft wrapped around the structure which allowed us to make out the shape as saucer like.  Both crafts not in unison were zipping back ! and forth until they made their way southeast in the sky and we lost visibility.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
