Cross shaped light that didn't move.;2002-07-04 21:00:00;2 minutes;Cross shaped light that didn't move. The object was a cross-shaped light of a light yellow, almost white, color.  The vertical bar of the object was solid, the horizontal bars were 2 separate bars which looked disconnected on either side of the vertical bar.  Sighting took place in a night sky over the ocean.  I was watching from Coney Island beach.  The object was over open ocean, not land, and too high in the sky to be an airplane, helicopter or fireworks, and it rested motionless in the sky.  I watched it for about two minutes.  Then I looked down at the beach for a second.  When I looked back up for the object it was gone.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
