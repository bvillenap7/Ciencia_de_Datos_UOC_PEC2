Two bright white lights, rotating around one another in a diamond shaped pattern, and an airplane just above them.;2001-07-16 22:45:00;30-60 sec;Two bright white lights, rotating around one another in a diamond shaped pattern, and an airplane just above them. i was laying in central park with my boyfriend.  we had just finished watching the new york philaharmonic orchestra.  we had been enjoying a beautiful night, and some wine and cheese.  just after the concert ended there was a short fireworks display, and the crowd began to disperse.  my boyfriend and i, however, were quite enjoying the cool beautiful summer night, and lingered for about 20 mins. on our blanket, practicing our spanish and giggling.  we were just off of 81st. ST. in Central park, on the Great Lawn.  He layed down, and i (fully clothed:))  stradled him and we talked like this for a while.  Suddenly he put his head back and stared at the sky.  Compelled by his intense gaze, i looked up as well.  What i saw was an airplane flying east, and just below it, two large bright white lights rotating over  one another in a wide diamond pattern.  He saw the same thing, but from a different angle.  The lights moved quickly to the east maintaining the rotation, but in less than 60 sec. they dissappeared into the north east, behind some thick clouds.  We got up and walked back to his apartment.  I am an actress and 20yrs old, and a character i played a while back was into sci-fi, so i did a lot of research in this area, and became obsessed with it.  So, as we walked home i slowly began to relate some of my findings with my boyfriend, who is in investment banking and 24yrs old.  Needless to say we were both freaked out and would like to know if anyone else in the city saw the same thing.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
I watched a diamond shaped craft hover for about 10 minutes, and captured some of it on video.;2002-03-11 11:30:00;5 minutes;I watched a diamond shaped craft hover for about 10 minutes, and captured some of it on video. I saw this thing up in the sky, several hundred feet away. I did have access to a video recorder at this time, and started filming. I just want to say that I was at work, and used the work camara that we have installed in the vehicle. It was diamond shaped, and hovered for several minutes.  That was when I decided to look at it through the video, so that I could use the 128 magnification to see exzactly what it was.  When it came into view on the screen...I knew it wasnt a plane. I have showed this film to people that I work with, whom none of them believe in this stuff (I do), and all same the same thing when they see it, what the hell is that? It is diamond shaped.  It was windy that day, yet it didn't move or sway. It did move eventually, and slowly floated West, out of the area. I took this video on a sunny afternoon.  I was hoping to see reports in the local paper, so that I would know others had seen it too, but nothing was reported. ((NUFORC Note:  We will request copies of the video.

Blue, red and yellow lights flashing. It was moving back and forth very low.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius?  PD));2006-01-24 22:01:00;1 hour;Blue, red and yellow lights flashing. It was moving back and forth very low. Out of control. The sky would flash very brightly in inter It was very bright and had Blue, red and yellow lights flashing. It was moving back and forth very low. Out of control so it could not be a normal aircraft.  The sky kept lighting up. The sky would flash very brightly in intervals. At one point it looked like the object shout out smoke and wa sleaving a trail of smoke. At the end i was with a friend and on the phone with another friend and it made a loud noise very similar to the sound from the war of the worlds. We all heard it the same. Another group of friends claimed to see it shining a bright light down but i could not see that from where i was. It was hard to tell between Diamons and Triangular. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this individual via telephone, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere and credible.  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been observing the star, Sirius, in the southern sky, but the witness said he did not think that was the case, and that police were possibly involved with the sighting event.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
