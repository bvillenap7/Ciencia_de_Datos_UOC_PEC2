Metallic Cylinder Moving thru New York Harbor;1997-10-15 15:00:00;2 minutes?;Metallic Cylinder Moving thru New York Harbor This has been bothering me for a long time. If someone can tell me what it is I'd be grateful. In the 70's I had lived in a house in the St George section of Staten Island. It was a lovely old place, on a bluff overlooking New York Harbor. I moved from there in 1975 and the house, along with the rest of the block, was torn down in the late '70's. On my birthday in 1997 I went by myself on a sort of pilgrimage to the site. The block had been turned into a parking lot and by 1997 the lot was not even being used. It was mid afternoon, sunny, I was sitting on a log on the site just looking out over the harbor. I saw a commercial jet coming up the harbor to my right and to my left I caught sight of a flock of seagulls. AND right behind the seagulls was a metallic cylinder, I'd say about 10 feet long and maybe a foot round? ( I'm not sure how to describe the measurements). If I had to guess it was moving at about 100 MPH. The sun was gleaming off the metallic surface. It was moving in a straight line at a steady speed going from Bayonne towards Brooklyn. I just watched it, fascinated. It flew UNDER the commercial jet so it could not have been too high up. Commercial Jets going up the Hudson are in their final descent to LaGuardia, so the jet couldn't have been more than 3000 feet up? And this cylinder thing flew under it. I watched the cylinder continue a on a steady path until it disappeared in the distance as it was heading toward Coney Island. I saw what I think was a UFO 30 years earlier and hadn't seen anything else before this happened, or since for that matter. The thing looked so everyday, so matter of fact that at first I didn't realize it was anything unusual. I've told a few people about it over the years, but I've always wondered what did I see?...If anyone has seen this thing or knows what it is I'd love to find out... For whatever it's worth I just noticed the boxes the boxes about being contacted by an investigator. I have no problem with that, however I don't think I can add anything more than what I've just written. Thanks;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Craft above field outside NYC, black torpedo glowing lights, flashed then disapeared.;2005-01-25 17:00:00;1 minute;Craft above field outside NYC, black torpedo glowing lights, flashed then disapeared. My friend and I were driving just outside the city, on our way to New Jersey. It was already dark. All of a sudden, a craft moved across a field, above the tree leve. It was shaped like an elongated torpedo. My friend, who's brother is in the air force, said he thought it might be a fighter plane, but when the object turned and we saw it in profile we realised it was no plane. It was a bluish black, very dark, and not all that far away from us. About as far as you see a plane thats comming in to land, in fact. Of course, we were shaken. The object made a whirring noise, like that of a chopper but not as mechanical. A purr, almost. The object had greyish lights where you may see cockpit windows on a regular plane. Also, they wern't so much eminating light as just glowing. There lights lit up, and then the craft disapeared.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
High Altitude object that reflected the sun, yet emmitted a bright white   changeing    to red spot light;2007-11-03 15:20:00;8 min.;High Altitude object that reflected the sun, yet emmitted a bright white   changeing    to red spot light I had observed a high altitude object that was traveling from WNW to ESE at a slow speed. I was located on the NE corner of 34 st & 8th Ave. in NYC. This object appeared at times to glisten in the sun, but would emit a bright light that would change in color from white to red, that gave the appearance of a spot light. At this time, I notice a North bound airliner which had generated four contrails south of the object in question. When the distance between the AC and the object closed several miles the object changed this tract to a southern direction, and appeared to pass the AC on the port side and pass through the contrails.  The object(spot light) would continually change in color from a bright white to red, but the object still reflected the sun. The Aircraft continued on its path, but I would think that they must have observed it also due to its proximity to the AC. I lost tract of the object shortly after it passed through the contrail. The object did not generate any observable contrail which I also found unusual. I have checked Heavens-Above for possible irridum flares, sattilites for that time and found none.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
UFO spotted on 9/19 at 8:00 PM near Newark Airport;2008-09-19 20:30:00;5 minutes;UFO spotted on 9/19 at 8:00 PM near Newark Airport I was driving westbound on I 278 when, at the beginning of the Goethals Bridge, I glanced out my passenger side window and saw something brightly illuminated.  Once we got on the bridge, my passenger and I had a clear view of the object.    It appeared to be a few thousand feet in the air, located in the bay between Bayonne and Elizabeth, NJ.  The triangular pattern of its three blinking red lights made me suspicious that it may be a jet liner heading for Newark Airport, but it looked nothing like the many other planes in the sky and was not on the normal approach pattern to the airport.   The object, when first viewed, appeared to be saucer shaped, with a raised flat top.  As we moved further along the bridge, the craft appeared to elongate into a cylindrical shape, however it seemed that the orientation of the craft to my car changed so I assume I was just getting a different view of the craft.   The craft, in addition to the lights, had a strange whitish blue hue to it that illuminated its body and made it stand out against the night sky.  It appeared to be moving slowly eastbound, but it is hard to say if it was really moving at all.   We lost sight of the craft soon after we exited the bridge.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Cylindrical object, glassy/translucent, in vicinity of helicopters.;2014-01-20 17:00:00;unknown;Cylindrical object, glassy/translucent, in vicinity of helicopters. Proceeding down the pedestrian walkway on Fort Hamilton Parkway, in Brooklyn NY, approaching Prospect Park, I observed three helicopters circling (wide and rapidly), to the northeast, as well as some flashes from the helicopters.  For orientation, my position would have put the Statue of Liberty to the southwest at approximately my 8:00.  From my perspective (about 15 feet elevated from ground level) the helicopters were at 30-40 degrees off horizon.  I thought the behavior of the helicopters odd, and wanted to video it, but managed only to get a series of photographs them (on a Droid Razr phone).  In reviewing the photos, I found one photo shows what appeared to be a cylindrical object, at a slight cant, reflecting light with a glassy aspect, in the vicinity of the helicopters.  I am an attorney by training, and work in a corporate setting.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
SILVER BULLET UFO HOVERING STATIONARY IN BROOKLYN SKY, THEN VANISHED!;2014-03-11 11:00:00;5 minutes;SILVER BULLET UFO HOVERING STATIONARY IN BROOKLYN SKY, THEN VANISHED! This morning the sky was blue.  Weather was nice.   I looked up at the sky as I left the Costco Warehouse and noticed lots of chemtrails crisscrossing the beautiful blue sky.  As I was gazing up, I noticed a silver bullet shaped object hovering stationary way up in the sky to the right of Costco between 2nd & 3rd Avenue, around 35th Street.   I looked down and back up and saw that the object was still there not moving.  It did not have any wings or propellers.  It was not a blimp.  No sound coming from it.  It was silent and silverbullet shaped and stationary high up.   I took out my camera to try and photograph it, but my zoom was not working properly.  As I looked up again, I noticed a airplane heading towards its direction.  As the airplane got closer towards the object...the object (UFO) simple disappeared!  Vanished right before my eyes!   I looked all around the sky and nothing!  Where did it go? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Two of them were closer to each other and the other in the front by itself.   At first I thought maybe it was a helicopter, but the object traveled from one side the sky to the other in about two seconds, then blinked and completely disappeared.   The whole thing took less than five seconds. No airplane or helicopter I've seen ever moved this fast or blinked off like that.  Wow!;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Cylinder shaped UFO rotatong like drill with 4 large lights followed by 4 saucer sphere ufos;2017-07-16 10:20:00;5 minutes;Cylinder shaped UFO rotatong like drill, with 4 large lights followed by 4 saucer sphere ufos. I witnessed from the indie of my gym Where I was laying on mat staring outside up in sky when 1 cylinder/cigar shaped UFO appeared.  It was rotating like a drill as it was also moving off axis and in a line towards the east.  As it rotated you would be able to see 4 lights that would only be on 1 side and seen after it fully rotated.  It has to be hundreds of feet long.   Then after it appeared 4 other smaller craft appeared that were to me saucer or spherical that blipped in and out behind it as soon as it appeared like they were tailing it because it to me looked like cylinder was somewhat out control because it was rotating and tilting liek it was on some type axis but still maintained a path in a line.  It looked exactly like that same cylinder sighting that was in UK by the officers.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
