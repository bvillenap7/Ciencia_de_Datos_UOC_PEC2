saw object flying without sound about 2-3 hundred feet above water next to Varrazano Bridge;1999-03-13 19:35:00;30-40 sec;saw object flying without sound about 2-3 hundred feet above water next to Varrazano Bridge While returing home from the local gym with my son last night I glanced over at the bridge (as I always do for its so lovely at night) and I noticed a pattern of light shaped like a backwards C with one small light in front of the main formation.  This made me look harder due the fact that it was so low and not on the usuaul flight path of the planes coming from the New Jersey Airport (the flight path brings the planes straight towards my house not from the side as this thing flew). I paused and looked closer and noticed as it passed it blocked the takeoff lights of the planes from a distance and the treeline on Staten Island.  I yelled to my 7 year old son to look and he stated he saw it too.  We watched as it flew over the horizon towards Coney Island. I see planes, traffic-copters nightly around here but this was  definately diffrent. I explained the event to my wife and she stated I was visibly shaken.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
slow moving object in fast paced NYC;2000-09-08 12:30:00;15 mins;slow moving object in fast paced NYC My workmate and I were sitting at lunch in the cafeteria in a manhattan building that looks over central park. It was September 8th, 2000 and we first saw a police helicopter circling around and we concluded that the helicopter was there because of the UN 2000 conference/meeting of world leaders. Then, I saw a reddish/amber object which seems stationary at first but then seems to move very slowly, I then asked my workmate what's that red thing there in the skies? he replied, oh, its one of those baloons. But, for some reason I kept on looking and the object now was showing a bright white color also, so I pointed that out to him and we decided to focus on the object and the helicopter. It was'nt long before we noticed that this thing was acutally moving in a circular fashion, that is, it was traveling and spinning, this was evident because we would see the bright white color and the reddish/amber, sometimes it appears that this was a two-colored object sometimes one. We became more curious when we realised that this thing was really moving upwards and getting smaller and that we now would only recognise the bright white color. By this time we knew it was not a baloon, nor a helicopter, nor any other object that we can recognise. In the midst of the whole scene we would look at each other and ask what da hell is that thing?  Then one of us suggested it might be one of those flying saucers, we both laughed as if to say yeah right. The object mounted so high that had it not been for the bright white light we would not be able to recognise it with our natural eyes. It disappeared when it mounted beyond some clouds so to us the clouds covered or blocked our view but it had gone so high already. I must say that it seems to pick up in speed as it climbed higher. Although maths is my favorite subject I am not good at estimating distances and sizes so I will not attempt to estimate either at any point in this experience. All i can say is that when I first saw this thing it was probably a little above the distance the helicopter was and at that point it was quite visable by the time it disappeared it became as the size of a miniature baseball. What is interesting is that there were other people(about 12-15) in the same cafeteria at the same time but we really never thought that we should bring it to anyone's attention because we were'nt sure what this thing was. There was a plane which was traveling ( in the opposite direction) high above the helicopter but this object was high above the plane. I am not going to conclude precisely that this was indeed an UFO for I still do not know what the heck this thing was but I know for certain that this was something like I aint never seen before. And the movement and awe startled me. If there's anyone who had a similar experience I would sure like to know what this was, maybe some expert can contact me or even someone who is a doubter. I know we were'nt dreaming, we had no strong drink, I dont smoke and i dont think my workmate does. Let me say one other thing, the direction in which the object move is as if it made a sideways V.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Rectangular-Shaped greyish-black object flying low over Astoria, Queens and Manhattan's West Side;2005-06-01 17:35:00;5 minutes;Rectangular-Shaped greyish-black object flying low over Astoria, Queens and Manhattan's West Side At 5:35pm June 1st, 2005, I witnessed a rectangular-shaped greyish black object making a lazy circle over Astoria, Queens at about 1000 feet.   The object was thin when viewed head-on.  I cannot estimate the size accurately, but given the range at least 500 feet, but less than 1000 feet long, and 100-200 feet wide.   The object flew over Astoria Queens at Astoria Boulevard, then made a wide circle and flew over the East River to the island of Manhattan, turning to fly south down its spine on Manhattan's west side.   The duration of the sighting was 5 minutes.   The first thought I had was, it was a banner being towed.  However, at no time did I see an airplane towing it, and there was no writing or advertisement on the greyish black object.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
A square shaped object approached the Verrazano Bridge from the north, turned left, and eventually disappeared.;2006-08-14 19:40:00;30 to 45 seconds;A square shaped object approached the Verrazano Bridge from the north, turned left, and eventually disappeared. I was listening to the Mets vs Phillies ball game on the radio in my bedroom on 8/14/06. It was still the first inning. Pedro Martinez had hit a batter and forced a run in, the Phillies catcher was up. I believe the time was about 7:40 P.M. I went into the livingroom to close the blinds and I saw a square shaped object moving from north to south. I overlook the Verrazno Bridge supporting towers and the object was somewhat above the height of the supporting towers. The object was square in shape and moved at about the speed of a dirigible. Not seeing an airplane in the area, I went back to the bedroom and got my glasses. I thought that the object might be a box kite but I discounted that because of the height. Back in the living room I saw that the object was now closer to the bridge. It was grey with a black design of some sort along the top and bottom. When it reached the area of the tower closer to Staten Island the object turned to its right, to the west, and continued in that direction until I could no longer see it. When it turned I could see that it was narrow. I thought that it might be an advertising banner being pulled by a plane but, as I indicate above, there was no plane in the area. I then thought that it might be a weather balloon despite its shape but a balloon could not turn as it did. I estimate that I am about 1 1/2 miles from the Brooklyn side of the bridge and the object was another 1/2 mile to 1 mile beyond that. Unfortunately, I own neither a camera nor binoculars. The sky was still light as the sun did not set until about 7:55 PM.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
matte black glider type craft, no lights, no sound;2006-10-01 12:30:00;1-2 mins;matte black glider type craft, no lights, no sound I know this happened years ago, but I have been thinking about it ever since and wondered if anyone has ever seen this type of “craft” or possibly also witnessed it back then.  It was approx 12:30pm, (I remember looking at my watch as soon as I saw this object) and I was walking up my driveway.  As I got to the end of the drive I happened to look up and stopped dead in my tracks.  There was a matte black glider type “craft”, above the houses across the street from me.  No lights, no sound, and it was shaped as if folded (like a square paper airplane almost).  There was a dark oval dome near the front, on top, but it was black and stood out because it was a bit shinier, like glass.   I was surprised at how low it seemed,  like only 20-25 feet above the houses, although it could have been more, but it was definitely low.  I watched it for maybe minute, possibly less, and when I looked up and down the street to see if anyone else was seeing it, and I looked up again ! it was gone.  I was surprised how heavy it looked although it was very silent and gliding lightly.  The area I live was residential and houses were 2-3 stories high, and I lived near the Hutchinson River Parkway, an odd area for someone to be gliding.

Small UFO sighting at Yankee Stadium in daylight.;2009-06-02 19:30:00;20 seconds;Small UFO sighting at Yankee Stadium in daylight. I was at the Yankee game yesterday (Yankees vs. Rangers).  I was sitting in the second row of section 420c (upper deck) with a friend.  I took my eye off the batter to look up at an overhead plane, and on the way, I noticed a small object only about 30 feet away over the field. The item was charcoal gray, probably metallic, and in the shape of a toaster.  It was only about one foot in size.  It spun around in circles, but always remained parallel to the ground, and had something similar to a reflector light on a bicycle in the upper right corner, which shined like a dimmed light.  It also had a small amount of haze over it. The item must have came in over the third base side of the stadium, I saw it when it was directly in front of me, and continued its path over the first base side of the stadium, accelerating after leaving the stadium, until out of view. When I first looked at it, I thought it was a garbage bag, floating in the wind, but then realized it couldn’t because a garbage bag would roll over rather than remain parallel.  It couldn’t have been a balloon, because it was not going in the exact same direction in the wind, nor was it rising at a fast pace or going straight up. I did not bother taking a picture of it, because when I saw it, I thought nothing of it, and when I realized this could be something else, it was too small and too far away to get a good shot with my cell phone camera.  However, my friend who I was at the game with saw it, and as many as 1,000 other people sitting in the vicinity could have potentially seen it.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Red and green lights on something moving in one direction, stopped, hovered, changed directions, stopped again, then flew out of sight.;2013-08-21 21:40:00;40 seconds;red and green lights on something moving in one direction, stopped, hovered, changed directions, stopped again, then flew out of sight. Around 9:40pm, I looked out my window to admire the beautiful (1-day post full) moon rising, when instead what caught my eye were the big bright red and green lights (2 of each) in a square/diamond formation moving silently across the sky perhaps about 10-15mph in a southwest direction, seemingly only about 1/4 or 1/3 of a mile high. Then it stopped, hovered for maybe 10, then changed directions and moved northward for perhaps about 300 feet before stopping and hovering again for about 20-30.   Then it flew westward and out of my visibility, and while it could have been a helicopter, I didn't hear anything that sounded like one, and I haven't known choppers to have big bright red/green lights but no white headlight.  Shrug... I'll probably never know!;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Large rectangular shape bright light over fishing vessel.;2013-09-21 20:30:00;15 seconds;large rectangular shape bright light over fishing vessel Gentlemen, I will be as descriptive as possible.  Night fishing out of Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, and the boat goes out to the Breezy Point, Atlantic side of the beach.  2 hours out and I happen to look up and see a rectangular light facing north.  It caught my attention because this light was very long and bright.  Airliners have small round beams of light this was huge.   The strangest thing is that it was a clear night and the stars were visible behind, through and around the object.  Visible to the point that an object emitting this kind of light would have been seen, blocked out some of the stars, made some sort of noise but you could not see or hear anything.   All I saw was the light facing away from the boat towards shore or north and the stars shining through it, whatever it was.  I cannot state in detail the size of this object or compare it to anything I have ever seen.  A cloud of smoke started to cover the light completely and in seconds it was gone.  No noise, no sound, nothing obscuring the stars.   I will wait for your response and do not patronize what I saw.  This was not ours.

Saw strange flying object hover over head for 10 minutes.;2014-12-12 09:10:00;10 minutes;Saw strange flying object hover over head for 10 minutes. I was taking a nap, and woke up out of sleep because of a loud sound, almost like an airplane jet.  I looked out my window and saw a strange rectangle object in the sky.  It stayed in my eye sight for nearly 10 minutes.  I am a bit freaking out right now.  I have pictures.   When it left, it was rectangle shape and left on a tilted slant.  It moved out of my vision once before it left, when an airplane was flying through (this object was not in the normal flight path of the planes ).  Once the airplane left, it came back.  The lights were green and white, i saw a red one flash in one picture making 3 lights.  I think it to be rectangle but in one picture it looks like a disk.  They are here!!;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

It was moving a rapid pace and went across Manhattan from the West to East side, just North of the Empire State Building.  In mid flight, a fireball appeared to propel it momentarily for 1-2 seconds, and it then cut to commercial break. After recording it from the TV and slowing it down frame by frame we could see an object that appeared to shape shift with each frame.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
UFO.;2017-05-03 08:00:00;10 minutes;UFO. A very large size, gray color, square shape object hover without any noise over Brooklyn.  I personally don't know what it could be.  I had a good 10 minutes sharp view of the object.  At a very clear sky.  I was trying to be rational but find no answer.  Unfortunately the video footage doesn't give back the ratio of the object.  Much larger than a Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopter.  I have photos captured also and after zooming in I saw the object hade colors and lights.

Group of about 7 UFO's, with a leader to the side, and a cluster to its north.;2017-06-11 11:00:00;2 minutes;Group of about 7 UFO's, with a leader to the side, and a cluster to its north. I went to take a rest from the flea market, and was shaded by a large bush.  I laid flat on the grass and had amber driving glasses on, in addition to my myopia lenses.  I was looking straight up to the zenith, watching airplanes from LGA airport, etc..  The sun was almost but not quite overhead, and shaded by a leafy branch, so I was able to gaze into the blue without the sun against me.  The clouds were minimal and there was a slight haze and I had a little coffee to drink and was relaxing.   Slowly, but suddenly, like a ghost appearing, there was a distant craft proceeding westward and slightly northward at an angle, slowly creeping.  It had a distinct boxy appearance almost like it had solar panels on both sides, and there was a faint blinking sidelight hard to make out because of the bright conditions.  It was at the limits of my visual acuity to make out any detail, but it was optical in nature as I was able to play with the image using my fingers in a triangle pinhole lens and saw it refract.   Soon after this, to my right (north), a group of approximately 5 (or more) of the same craft appeared in a rough and slowly jiggling polygon along with an extra slightly off to one side (apple).  This cluster slowly appeared out of nothing, and they too had faint blinking lights.  There was no entry direction, and were ghostly in appearing.  It stayed like this for about 2 minutes and then as if on cue, all of them slowly faded back into nothingness without any abrupt motions.  The lone craft from the beginning was proceeding in its same linear direction and still visible, and then that, too, slowly disappeared in a ghostly fashion.   At the end of this, I checked the sky without the amber lenses and saw that the area where there was the cluster of the craft was blue without clouds and only some haze as it was a hot day.   The lone craft was in an area of very thin cloud.  They did not act like drones and there were too many of them, and they just appeared and disappeared.  They did not get bigger or smaller there was no noise and they all looked the same.   I had thoughts of some kind of refraction from a remote area, but the behavior and the coincidences of this happening don't seem to fit as being manmade, which is why I make this report to you.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
