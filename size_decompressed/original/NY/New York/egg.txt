Observation of egg blimp shapped object in front of World Trade Center Towers, NY.  Possibly a second sighting.;1994-08-25 11:45:00;5 Mins +;Observation of egg blimp shapped object in front of World Trade Center Towers, NY.  Possibly a second sighting. I have pasted the sighting information I am referring to at the end of my account regarding same.  I respond to this as a possible additional witness to this event, my account is as follows:   I was working as a long haul truck driver and viewed this thing from the north bound New Jersey Turnpike, off and on, between Newark International Airport and exit 3 where I was to exit the turnpike, and proceed west to my destination.  My reference to seeing the object off and on, has to do with observing it, and continuing to drive the vehicle, not that the object would disappear and reappear.  I too am unsure of the exact date, however, after coming across this, I will be digging out my old log books to pinpoint it precisely.  I was able to view it consistently for about 3 or 4 minutes when I had to sit stopped in traffic at exit 3.  It was at this time I was also able to further verify, in my mind, that I was seeing something, I did not know what it was.  I even tried to see if the event was being reported on the FM radio in the truck by hitting the scan button, as well as a radio scanner I had in the vehicle, finally, of course the C.B.   My search of the airwaves on the radios yielded nothing out of the ordinary.  I also wondered if any one in New York City was looking up that day since I was not hearing outside news of this event. This thing was egg or blimp shaped and dull silver in color.  It was, from my vantage point at exit 3, hovering then moving slowly forward and back, in front of the World Trade Center Towers.   As I observed it during my travel from where I first saw it, (Newark International Airport), until I got stopped in traffic at exit 3, I figured it was a small blimp, or balloon used for advertising.  When I got stopped in traffic at exit 3 and able to study the object closer, IE: with out distraction, I assured myself it was NOT a blimp or a balloon.  It had no fins, no control gondola, no appendages of any kind that you would expect to see on a balloon or blimp, nor did it have any advertising on it.   As I continued to watch this thing a white Bell Jet Ranger helicopter approached it, and appeared to be in close proximity to it.  The object would have been about 2.5-3.5 times the size of the helicopter that was approaching it.   I was unable to see what happened next, as the helicopter continued to approach, since traffic started to move.  When I was able to again direct my attention back to the object, a minute or so later, it, and the helicopter, were gone.  The weather was clear and sunny that day.  This is not the first time I have seen an object like this, the last time was in 93 just west of Deming NM, and south of I-10.  At least I have one nagging question answered regarding this, if we did indeed see the same thing, at least I was not the only one looking up that day!  Occurred : 8/25/94 12:00 (Entered as : 08/25/94 12:00)  Reported : 5/19/00 11:15  Posted : 6/6/00  Location : New York, NY  Shape : Egg no light and moved very slowly I was looking outside of my window at work and saw a light blue metallic blimp shaped thing, moving very slowly.  It was very close to my window, 4 flights up and much smaller than a blimp.  On the bottom, near the back, it had a stick, kind of diagonal, and small.  This was in Manhattan where we never see anything.  I never found out what it was, do you have any idea.  I don't know the date, but it was 6 or 7 years ago.  Thank you.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Egg Shaped Object Circling;2002-10-01 19:20:00;5 minutes;Egg Shaped Object Circling I saw an egg shaped UFO flying relatively low and alot larger than a plane moving around slowly in what seems liked circular motions. My father was driving at the time and I pointed it out to him, we watched it as we drove and when it went out of site behind tree cover we rushed home to get binoculars and head to Gateway Park to try an observe it, but we could not see it from there... Did anyone else see it on this date anywhere, or especially on staten island? Please e-mail me @ ((e-mail deleted)) There was also either 1 or 2 white lights on the object. ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC receives so many reports of blimps from the NYC area that we feel that is the first possible explanation for the sighting that shoulr be ruled out.

I immediately picked up my camera starting filming as I zoomed closer to it it started to change size and its light was dimmering then real bright. I thought it could be a chopper but then suddenly this thing had a shinning ring under it .. Also i observed that a shadow or something was flying around it wat appeared to be some other form of lights. I would say that the location of this thing was near the VARANZANO Bridge in Brooklyn.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

At first one of my friends ((female name deleted)) just said look at how low that it but  as it got closer we saw that it was not an airplane or helicopter.  IT was egg shaped but had a straight rod coming out both sides.  It was kindof gre metallic black and had 4 lights on the bottom of it which were a dull blue.  As it approached it shot up higher and discharged a small disk shaped object ( a pod maybe?) then it grew steadily higher and while it was right above us we all felt a lot of static electricity going thro us but no noise. Then the UFO shot toward the empire state building and seemed to hover a distance above it and then it  floated upward into the cloads.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

For five minutes around midnight of 28 june we watched  a silent slow-moving well-lit disc-shaped object moving from north to east..;2009-06-29 00:15:00;5 min;For five minutes around midnight of 28 june we watched  a silent slow-moving well-lit disc-shaped object moving from north to east.. The craft was moving very very slowly from the north to the east. at first it appeared as if it had the shape of a dirigible (a horizontal oval balloon tapering towards the left). it was well lit with a white light. hence its framework was clearly visible and its outline was well-defined. it must have been of the same size as a large aeroplane. it had a single red light at the centre of its base. It must have been at a low height because an aeroplane that appeared at the same time was flying at a much geater height. the aeroplane disappeared quickly. the ufo was still moving slowly behind some trees in our neighbourhood (green drive, roslyn, nassau county, ny) and took about two minutes to reappear from behind them. it then dipped downwards and then it became clear that its shape was actually round with a bulging centre as if two shallow bowls had been joined together rim to rim. in a minute or so it disappeared. we did not hear any sound throughout this time. The three of us who watched this craft are : 1. civil engineer, 63 years, male. 2. school teacher, 58, female. 3. housewife, 58. we are all from india on a visit to the usa.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Huge Egg Shaped Glowing Hovering Behind Manhattan (Seen from Brooklyn: Bushwick Rooftop);2016-07-17 22:35:00;30 minutes;Huge Egg Shaped Glowing Hovering Behind Manhattan (Seen from Brooklyn: Bushwick Rooftop) A looming, glowing, egg-shaped object appeared in the sky at around 10:30 pm and began to hover left and right up and down across what was guesstimated to be the JFK bridge.  The egg flashed between red, white and a greenish tinge but would resume to a glowing white while stationary and didn't move at all.  It suddenly would go off (become dark but still slightly visible) the bottom of the shape was dimly lit.   The object was in the sky for a good 30 minutes repeating the movements and changing of color as it crossed along the back of Manhattan from the view of outer Manhattan.   The object then began to hover slowly along the Manhattan line (behind the city/the Hudson presumably) and stopped right about at the Upper West Side area and disappeared in a split second completely.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Egg shape object trailing plane in Queens, NY.;2017-08-19 06:20:00;3 minutes;Egg shape object trailing plane in Queens, NY. On the morning of August 19th, at approximately 06:20 hrs., myself and 2 other people witnessed a commercial airplane in the sky above Jamaica/Queens.  Trailing at a very close proximity to the plane was an egg shaped metallic looking object.  It was trailing the plane at the same distance (which was very close to begin with) for approximately 20 seconds.   It then began getting closer to the airplane, until it looked like it was within several feet of the tail section, and it remained there for the remainder of the sighting, which lasted only a couple of minutes.   The direction of flight was Northwest and it would have flown right over JFK airport before we witnessed it.  This was a very clear and bright morning.  How is it that nobody else saw this?  I have never seen anything like this.  I just can’t get it out of my head.   This object had no wings.  It was a grey metallic object  (same color as the plane).  I know I’m not crazy because other people with me saw it.  I am sick that I didn’t film it.  It would have been so clear if I did.   I think the pilot might have known something was there because he dipped his wings a couple of times (like he was looking for something).;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
