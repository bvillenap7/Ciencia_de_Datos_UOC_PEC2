Alien working in a store in a busy neigborhood blending in with us.;1989-06-01 23:00:00;3 hours;Alien working in a store in a busy neigborhood blending in with us. In the summr of 1989 I had been on my new job for about a year.  I'm in to health food products, and a co-worker told me that there was one near my place of employment. She said that she believed it was a small store.  At 5:00 P.M., I left my job and started looking for the store. I figured that it would be nice to be able to purchase items like vitamins, etc. on my lunch hour. By the time you get off from work and travel to these little stores, they're closed.  I walked down the street slowly, looking on both sides of the avenue, trying to find the store.  Eventually, I came upon a small store that I figured had a good chance of being it.  The building above it was abrownstone that was boarded up.  I steped down the one or two steps and opened the door to the shop.  Almost as soon as I walked in, I had a feeling that this wasn't the best place.  There was a man there.  He was my height 56, skinny, dark, but otherwise normal.  I have a very clear, loud voice, and because of my previous vocal instructions over time, somewhat loud.  I asked the man, whether he had whatever the herbal remedy was that I wanted.  He became very angry and said in a voice that was almost as loud as mineyou got some nerve coming in here with all that attitude.  I immediately answered him with what the hell are you talking about atitude.  Without saying another word, He aimed his finger at my heart and something that I coiuldn't see hit me in the heart.  I have ben know for having a lot ot courage so me being me, I just stood there and stirred at him. Then he said, I could have just killed you. I then realized that I was in more danger than I realized. I also knew what I had accidentally come upon.  There was a conversation that followed where I sought of asked where he was from, but he only said that it was a long way from here.There was great emphysis on long. Every time he moved around the store, you never saw him move to another location, he just appeared at that spot. Some how, I was asleep and while still standing, I felt my feet being kind of numb.  I had been standing in that same spot for a couple of hours. When I finally got up the nerve to say that I was leaving, he said we are leaving tomorrow to. That would have been Wednesday. I walked to the door, and as I looked around he said, when you get home tonight I want you to say xxxxxxx.  I didn't say it then and I won't say it now.  As far as I am concerned, that could have been some password the he could have used to take me aboard his space ship.  As I placed my hans on the door, his face blurred and changed to what he really looked like.  He was still my height, very dark, but his eyes were large but that skin around the eyes reminded me of a crocodile.  Ther was a thin yellow line running from one corner of the eye to the other. And he laughed out loud. He surely wasn't pretty. I really wanted to ask more questions, but thought better of it.  On Thursday, the day after he said they were leaving, I walked down to that store, near the curb.  I wanted to see if there was anybody there.  Would you believe, the place looked as though no one had ever been there.   It was empty.  I rode past on the bus ther other day, and the place had been undergoing renovations. It's now a nice looking brownstone with a store.  I'd like to know who rented it before.  The things that I saw him do, couldn't have been done by anyone other than an alien.  I'm now actually glad that I had the experience.  It told me what I suspected all along, that we are living with these people and cannot tell the difference. When I saw how he just changed his appearance within one or two seconds, I was surprized, to say the least.  This really happened in 1989.  I was sought of afraid to mention it because I didn't know whether or not I should.  Don't know who you're speaking to these days.

I witnessed a being in the middle of the day in Manhattan about six and a half feet, its face definately not human?;1999-10-01 17:00:00;5 seconds;I witnessed a being in the middle of the day in Manhattan about six and a half feet, its face definately not human? okay here it goes... I was ascending the escalator at Penn Station, when I reached street level, towards my left about 20 feet away, in what seemed like a male figure, standing tall about 6 feet 7 inches near the mouth of the entraceway to the station.  Crowds of commuters flowed around him, as though he wasn't there, he stared at the variety of passersby as though he were trying to choose one of them. I caught a glimpes of his face, maybe is eye too, I don't remeber if he looked at me or not...for no more than two seconds and looked away immediately, kept walking down the sidewalk, without turning back, feeling that if I did turn around for another look, however far away I was getting, it would be the end of me.  The fear instilled in me was so tremendous to this day I can't explain it. His face was not human, his eyes looked right through you...It was something I wanted to forget as soon as possible but couldn't...it's as though he had some kind of will that said, keep walking, don't stop, don't look, this does not concern you. His face was a light grey almost white, thick brow, menacing eyes and the thing that stays in my mind most was his stature or the way he was standing, his back arched, broad shoulders, his elbows poining towards his back, his head tilted down just a bit looking at the tops of peoples heads, scoping them out.....it was a normal day, people going about their business and there was this thing standing right in broad daylight? I know it was not human. but that's crazy, because if this was a sighting then we are all in deep ((deleted)).;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

see below;2000-03-14 04:50:00;5 minutes;see below Me and my boss(Vic) witnessed a very bright object over or near Staten Island early Tuesday morning around 5 a.m. One very bright light shown from it as it hovered for about 1 minute then its light dimmed, it flew south towards New Jersey at a very hight rate of speed. A red and blue light was seen as it flew away. We could see it somewhere over NJ as we drove on the West Shore Expressway in Staten Island. We watched it as it appeared to hover or fly slowly over NJ. Its red and blue lights visible, it began to accelerate as its bright light re-appeared. We watched for a few minutes as it finally seemed to hover over Staten Island again. We slowed down to about 15 MPH as we watched its lights began to dim and the craft began to tilt upwards towards a 90 degree angle. Its shape appeared to be maybe triangular but once the lights dimmed we could not tell for sure. We estimated its distance from us at about 1000 yards and an altitude of 1000-2000 feet. We did not hear any sounds from this craft at all.We did not stick around to watch what happened next as traffic beared down on us from behind, we exited the expressway. When we reached the overpass after we exited there were no signs of planes, lights or other crafts in the sky.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
UFO buzzes Mets Game at Shea Stadium???;2002-05-11 14:30:00;unknown;UFO buzzes Mets Game at Shea Stadium??? I was doing yardwork in Aurora Colo.  Needing to listen to something, I turned on my radio, I think to KOA radio 85.  I was trying to get the station fine tuned on a dinky, nearly worthless radio.  What I heard, if I heard what I think I heard, was astounding:  Announcer one:  What was that?  Announcer two:   I don't know,but those jets really poured on their afterburners trying to catch it.  The Rockies game being broadcast was being played at Shea Stadium somewhere in N.Y.  I really think I heard this, but it was through the static as I tuned in.  The announcers thereafter went on calling the game as though nothing unusual had happened.  I don't have time or inclination to check it out, but if you think its worthwhile you can.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Object Produces Vortex of Clouds.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  Possible hoax.  PD));2005-06-15 15:00:00;5-10minutes;Object Produces Vortex of Clouds It was a warm day in the middle of June. My brother and I were working in our backyard, suddenly my brother said: Look over there- What is that?  To my shock there was a black object in the sky repeatedly doing circular patterns in the direction of the Verrazano Bridge, and hard to determine at what altitude.  As it did this a vortex of gasseous vapor appeared from where the oject was moving, the vapor continued spreading out and the object repeated the maneuvers.  About 10 minutes later a sudden and powerful thunderstorm came, and lasted for about 15-20 minutes.  Afterwards the sky cleared up and there was no sign of the object.  My brother and I are both positive that the vortex of clouds and most likely the thunderstorm originated from this object.

possible ufo ??;2005-06-17 22:28:00;about 40 secs;possible ufo ?? I was on my roof on June 17th,2005 at 10:28 est observing the stars,moon &sky I sometimes do when I have extra time.  I was using my new Meade CaptureView 8x42 Digital Camera Binocular.  ((For full specs on this Camera got to: http://www.meade.com/manuals/TelescopeManuals/CaptureView/CV-5.pdf.)) The settings were as follows  mode=movie,size=2M(1600*1200), lighting=auto exposure.   As I was observing the stars through the Meade I noticed what appeared to be a star moving in the sky.  I tried to focus and track this star or ufo?? (wasn't sure at this point).  I was moving from east to west trajectory.  I noticed that the object appeared to be speeding up then slightly slowing down.  Through the Binoculars the object appeared to have  a yellowish tint to it.  The object appeared to be disappearing and appearing agian then was gone.  The entire time I was pressing the button on the Meade because I thought the camera was set in still-mode but apparently it was in movie mode (operator mistake).  What I was actually doing was starting and stopping the movie mode lasting about 8 secs each time.  I captured about 1 sec of what I believed to be the object on video. I am a  4 yr military veteran and this was not a plane.You are welcome to have an image analysis to explain what the object is.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Five objects in sky around LaGuardia airport, N.Y.C., daylight.;2006-06-20 10:45:00;1 hour +;Five objects in sky around LaGuardia airport, N.Y.C., daylight. I was on break when i noticed a bright point of light (silvery)in a northern position over LaGuardia airport. The object was stationary.At first I thought it was a satellite in a polar orbit. After maby five minutes two other objects came into view taking up a triangular formation. It was like light reflecting off a metal surface. The light was flickering and then the two other objects were in focus. The objects remained in a stationaty position. A few minutes following this two other objects also appeared to the east of the three objects. The position of the three objects was to the west of the airport and the other two to the east of the airport. Within fifteen minutes the first object left the formation and moved in a southern direction. The speed of the object was slow as if it was taking it's time with, the remaining objects holding their position. After whatching the moving object I looked back at the remaining objects and another object took up the position to form the triangle with the formation now smaller. Following this cloud cover moved in and I lost the oblects above the clouds. At the time of the sightings the sky was clear with unlimited visibility. So, the objects stood out against a clear blue sky. Thinking about it now it seems as if the objects were entering our atmosphere and appeared to be under intelligent control.

I noticed approximately 15-20 yellow lights in a u formation flying above. I was facing West, downtown New York City was to my left. The Empire State building was to my right. The formation continued above me and slowly changed formation. It was the top half of a heart formation. There were many airplanes circling the city. The formation of lights was approximately 4 times the width of the aircrafts that I saw around the city. The formation continued southward towards the moon. I ran downstairs one flight to grab a friend. By the time I got back up to the roof the lights had disappeared. We could only see the normal aircrafts in the sky.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

High Flying Metallic object seen over queens, NY.;2007-05-13 18:20:00;5 minutes;High Flying Metallic object seen over queens, NY. At approximately 6:20 PM, myself and 2 witnesses saw a small metallic object flying in a southwesterly course.  At first, we believed the object to be a high flying plane, but we retrieved binoculars, and close up, it just appeared to be a metallic shape, but not a plane.   The object crawled slowly across the sky.  After approximately 5 minutes, we lost site of the object. There may have been a light on it, or simply the sun shine bouncing off it.  As  we are near an airport, there were several aircraft in the vicinity. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

I could see that it was a solid object. it moved over to the right slowly. then it just stood there, for about 30 seconds. then it went in a south westerly direction. then it stopped again. then i did not see it. i looked in the sky to see anything, and it re appeared to my right again. this time seeming to go away from the earth.. i still saw light, a very bright light. i was something... i was in awe...and i really dont know who to tell about something like this....

One night whether it was a dream or what....I opened my eyes, and I was not in my room anymore...I was in some room that was so bright sort of like a soft neon white glow, which in that case I could not tell the depth of the room. It had no windows, or doors, and I was lying flat down on some kind of surface. I could not move, whether it was my finger or head...I tried to lift my head, but I felt as if my whole body was numb. At that moment a few beings just appeared, from what door iI dont know, they were already in position, next to each other, but standing a little away from where I was lying. There was this one being that I guess walked up to me, and started to lean over me and looked at my face, what he was looking at, or for I don't know...I was so horrified., but I could not move...He was grayish beige, with huge long eye's that sort of went slant..after a few moments of looking at me, my body started to go down, and this tunnel like fashion was around me and I saw the alien face descend further away, still looking down at me...Then I woke in my bed still horrified......what was this?

Object had no visible lights or sparkle… it was dull and fast moving… roundish but dim so no detail… it seemd to reflect the ambient city light, similar to that ugly glow seen on clouds over city, but maybe darker..…  Object appeared to be moving maybe 20 times faster than any other craft in sky then… plenty of aircraft were visible before and after event…  Object may have been above the cloud bank, in them, or just beneath.  It was so fast and silent and unexpected. Viewer never seem anything like it. If up at that cloud level, it was very big.  Viewer had sense the ufo was on a mission, puposeful.. poor eyes and most people out at night would have totally missed it... viewer happend be looking toward right patch of sky.

I was looking at the Manhattan skyline from the east looking west.  There are some smoke stacks toward the NW a few hundred feet above the stacks were about ten of lights stretching at least a mile.  At first I thought I was helicopters, but it was very cloudy and dark that morning and I was surprised I could see the lights with such low visibility.  And it made no sense for helicopters to be at the same height in the same area.  I boarded my train because I didn’t want to be late to work and I couldn’t stay to see where it/they went.

a few red light many white illumining lights,  in the Bronx, observed from my bedroom window and the other individual was in the street;2010-05-25 21:30:00;20;a few red light many white illumining lights,  in the Bronx, observed from my bedroom window and the other individual was in the street It was very clear outside I had just called my son because he was out checking on my car. After getting him on his phone he stated that he was at the car so I went to my bedroom window to check on him. As I looked in the direction of the car I noticed a bunch of lights in the sky. The majority of the lights were white but a few were red. The lights were very clear and visible on the objects. I stated to my son that he should look out of the back window of the car and see the lights but at then at that moment I noticed that there was more than one of the objects. Two of the objects were very close together maybe about 100 to 200 ft. and the other three were further away in distance. I keep telling my son to get out the car and look that I was not trying to be funny he stated that he saw the object earlier and that he thought because it was in the sky that it had to be a blimp. I stated that a blimp is not that bright and that blimps does not hover like that! the light were very clear I could not put a shape to the object but it definitely was not that of a of a blimp. I don't believe that I have every encountered (UFO) the shape before. By the time my son got out the car to look only one of the objects was remaining. We watched the object until my son got across the street visible. I had attempted to take a picture but was unable to because the phone I picked up did not have a media card in it.  I went back to the window shortly after to see if I could see the object again but the objects had disappeared. There was a plane or are craft in the air at the time of the sighting. You could tell the difference because of the movement that the plane had I know a plane when I see one.  I am reporting this because the object was an UFO not to make jokes what you do with the information is up to you. On August 27, 2001 I called (911) and reported the information to my police department that the airplanes were flying very low after obser! ving for a couple of weeks on my own, they informed me that it! was a b limp on Sept 11, 2001 the world trade center went down. I later found out that the direction of the plane was that of the World Trade Center. I still get chills to this day.  I don't know what the objects were but that why it is called UFOs I could not identify the sighting. The feeling that I got from the UFO was soothing and the movement was that of something in observation.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

It had some kind of blue lighting but i could not discern a shape. there was no sound emanating from this object.  i would estimate that this object was about a quarter mile east of me.  i would estimate that the said vehicle was about 25 ft above the treeline.   I lost sight of the vehicle from the position where i was sitting.  I rose from my position which was on the southside of my house, to the eastside of my house to see if i could get a better visual.  At that time I lost sight of the unidentified object.   I live in an area where planes and helicopters fly over.  This object did not display the flight characteristics of these vehicles or any sound and flew at an extremely slow speed. the duration of the observation was about 15 secs.   Then vehicle disappeared from my view.  I did not at anytime see it accelerate.  Just lost sight of it.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Reddish-orange object over New York City.;2015-07-04 23:48:00;5 minutes;Reddish-orange object over New York City. I saw a reddish-orange object coming down from high in the sky over New York City.  It seemed almost fiery.   At first I thought it was a meteor and I thought we were all going to die.  Suddenly, it stopped falling and began moving towards Maspeth at a very fast pace.  I lost sight of it because of a large tree in the way.   When I saw it again it was climbing back up towards the sky until I could no longer see it.

I was just absent-mindedly looking up, and after a couple of minutes, at around 2:47 am., I saw a huge streak of golden yellowish light catch my peripheral vision from the east side of Manhattan.   I didn't think much of it, but 2 minutes later, I saw the same golden streak of light zoom by towards what looked like downtown, going south of central park.   I was absolutely shocked and almost panicked.  A couple of minutes later mayber 3 to 5 minutes later, i saw the streak of light again moving incredibly fast towards the west side of Manhattan, maybe towards Jersey.  That was the last time I saw the golden streak of light.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Small flashing/blinking light in the sky moving in a circular/triangular form with red, white, and blue like lights.;2016-08-29 00:20:00;1 hour;Small flashing/blinking light in the sky moving in a circular/triangular form with red, white, and blue like lights. While getting something to drink I looked outside the top window of the kitchen and noticed a little blinking light in the sky.  I didn't think much of it at first and thought it was an Airplane but after I finished drinking I noticed it hadn't moved at all and kept staring at it for 4 minutes until I realized what I'm seeing is not a plane.  I ran to tell my mother to look at the sky. That there's a little blinking/flashing little light in the sky. And went back to the kitchen to keep looking at it.  I called my sister to have a better view.  Terrified and freaked out after noticed it's moving in a small triangular, circular form she went to bed and covered herself.  I stared at it for almost an hour.  Showing red, white, blue color flashes. I noticed it moving in a small formation and sometimes just staying still.  I posted it on social media to see if anyone else is seeing it.  I texted my brother.  I messaged a friend that lived near by but no one was able to see it from there view of their building.  Than a huge cloud formation came and covered it.  Knowing it would take a while before the clouds moved again I went to take a quick shower and came back to see the clouds leave and it was gone...  I didn't come back to try and see if it had comed back. I was in denial and felt I was going crazy...  Thinking it was just a realistic dream...  Unable to sleep until finally at 7 am... Unfortunately there was not a good enough camera in my home that could capture the image of it.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
I believe that an unknown creature teleported into my backyard;2016-12-06 17:00:00;<1 minute;I believe that an unknown creature teleported into my backyard I was looking down at my phone, when I saw a flash of light.  I quickly turned to my window and it was pitch black.  My window was also cracked.  So I heard the trees ruffle immediately after the flash.   There was a dog in the backyard of the neighbors on the next block.  The dog had not made a sound the entire evening.  There was no barking, no ruffling of the bushes, or anything of the sort.   Immediately after the flash and ruffle of the trees, the dog barked once. I looked out of the window to see if I would see a shadow in the little lighting in my backyard.  But I saw nothing in the 5 minutes I waited to see something move.  But the dog never made a peep the time I was looking down from the 5th floor.  I was, periodically, whistling for the dog to make a noise.  But it never happened.  It just seeemed very strange to me.  That flash has never happened in my backyard.  Plus, the ruffling of the tree was eerie.  When the dog stopped after one bark, I was sure there was something down there.  My partner told me to relax because it was nothing.  But I believe that there was some kind of teleportation that occurred.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

They appeared to be star or cross shaped but I couldn't make out a definite shape.   The objects weren't making any sound.  They were slow-moving, changing flight positions and tumbling, together heading southeast.  During their flight one of the objects appeared to attach itself to another while they all flew. They were higher than commercial aircraft, so they looked like small objects.   I watched them for about 2-4 minutes heading east/southeast until I either lost sight of them or they popped.  I thought they might be weather balloons, but I wouldn't know what I was looking at.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Grey cloud turned goldish then white/ silvery and when silvery looked like numerous objects;2017-10-20 16:00:00;10 minutes;grey cloud turned goldish then white/ silvery and when silvery looked like numerous objects Looking south from a rooftop on North 9th (near corner of Meserole) and saw what looked like a grey cloud (it was a totally cloudless day).  After a few seconds cloud turned to a goldish color then to a white/ silvery color (when it turned silvery/ white it looked like it could have been 4-6 smaller objects).  It then disappeared and returned a few seconds later as a grey cloud.  This cycle repeated about 10 times.  It was too high to be birds and stayed in the same area of sky the entire time..;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Unknown object over Upper West Side NYC;2018-09-16 00:00:00;18:05;Unknown object over Upper West Side NYC Sunday the 16th of September, 2018, around 6:05 PM, with a clear blue sky and no clouds around in New York City, my wife and kids were walking North on Broadway on our way home.  She was a few yards ahead of me with our youngest and I was walking behind with our 15 year old.   Around 89th St. and Broadway I noticed a reflection high in the sky, maybe a circular shape but not sure.  I’m not sure if it was a light or if it was a reflection from the sun on the object because the view was coming in and out as it was moving north the same way we were walking.  My 15 year old also took notice and he grabbed my phone and took a short video. The video captures a bright object but it was too high to tell what it was.  It wasn’t an airplane because we saw airplanes flying around and we see them all the time.  They always fly at a low level because they follow the same pattern into LaGuardia.  We also see the pattern of airplanes flying into Newark Airport.   It wasn’t a helicopter because it was way too high.  It wasn’t a balloon because the movement wasn’t scattered the way a balloon moves with the wind and the wind at that time “I checked” was blowing SE at 8.1mph.  This unknown object was moving slowly north then it slowly tuned towards the west heading towards the Hudson River that separates New Jersey and New York.  Eventually we lost sight of the object because of the buildings.  I’m writing here just in case someone also saw something, same date and time.   If you want to ask me questions you may call me but what I wrote here is pretty much what I saw.  I will see how I can send the video.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

At least 20 circular orbs were floating in the sky. Initially thought they were stars, but noticed they were moving.  The orbs were floating up and out of the atmosphere not linear. One separate object last to vanish was flashing.  When I zoomed in with my camera, I noticed it was moving in a way that defied physics.
