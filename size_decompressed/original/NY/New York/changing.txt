P.S.154 Sighting in the South Bronx;1970-05-05 19:00:00;5 min.;P.S.154 Sighting in the South Bronx I was playing at the P.S. 154 play yard.  I was playing right field on an asphalt ball field.  All of a sudden, the pitcher, Eddie Rodriguez looks up and continues to stare at the sky.  All the players looked up and there were 2 moons.  The moon that wasn't supposed to be there released a smaller object that soon overshadowed the original and was very large in the sky.  It looked like it was alive and was about fall on the ball field.  My friend, Eladio Alvarez, said run it's going fall on the park.  Eddie and I couldn't believe our eyes.  This thing was going to crush the park and everyone in it.  Over 150 people started running for their lives.  As I watched this thing get massive over the park, it disintegrated to the sides.  Disappeared and I've never seen anything like it again.  Many people saw this.  I just happened to be in the South Bronx play yard of P.S. 154. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Strange thing that changed into a pearl.;1985-04-01 15:00:00;10 mins;Strange thing that changed into a pearl. It was a Sunday mid afternoon, where I and a co-worker finished our shift in the Humane Society of NY on a Sunday afternoon.  We walked to 3rd or Lexington Avenue and 59th Street, cant remember off hand, but there were a lot of people.   At the corner, I noticed a male model whose name I cant remember, but he was Scandinavian-looking with long blond hair and was often featured shirtless in the  80's ads.  I pointed him out to my coworker and she said oh yeah uh huh.  He walked past us while talking to a male companion and as I had turned to look at him, I noticed a thing flying in the Eastern sky.   It was odd looking, with a multi-angled shaped top and a grey brown box below it, like an engine.  It flew noiselessly emitting a little dark smoke.   I stared at it and pointed to it exclaiming, (name deleted)! look! what's that.  (name deleted) was exhausted and replied Oh I dont know while yawning.  I thought it was strange that she expressed no interest.  The thing flew directly above the Queensboro bridge and stood there.  We stared and it did something even stranger.  The craft morphed itself into a spherical white metallic ball.  It resembled a pearl in the sky.  There were clouds above it and the white pearl could still be seen.  It reflected a little of the sun on its surface.  It stayed there not moving.  We stood and look amongst the crowds and no one noticed.  We left after a while since there was no change occuring.

One bright object ejected 3 others which trailed east slowly with long tails;1999-11-16 18:55:00;~2 minutes;One bright object ejected 3 others which trailed east slowly with long tails I was in the American Airlines flight 785 scheduled to leave New York Laguardia at 17:55 on 17 November 1999.  We left about 15 minutes late from the gate and didn't take off for about another 35 minutes.  After we left the ground the pilot came over the PA and said we had Philadelphia out the left and would soon see Wilmington.  I looked out my window to the North.  I knew it was north because I had located the big dipper and had found the North star.  We were heading close to due west.  Out my window I noticed a light and thought it was another airplane.  The light appeared to be at a slightly lower altitude than the one we were at.  I watched the light and noticed that it was getting brighter.  Thus it was either getting closer or increasing in brightness.  I thought it was an airplane and started getting nervous as it appeared to be coming directly at us.  That is it's brightness increased.  I then noticed that it got extremely bright in the center and appeared to have an airplane like shape.  That is a bright center and tapered to the east and west as if it had two bright wings.  All this time it appeared as a bright white light.  Next I heard the pilot say something about a meteor out of my side of the plane.  I then noticed that the bright flattened shaped light appeared to explode into two or three more objects heading due east.  I then truned and told the fellow next to me that he should look at the meteor too.  He did and also saw what followed.  The bright initial light appeared to slowly fade into nothing.  The 2 or 3 objects that were left then headed due east.  One after the other apparently on the same course.  They moved very slowly and had a long tails that were about the same distance or a little less than the distance between the two stars of the big dipper which point to the north star.  The tails appeared to be the same length.  The were about the same luminosity except for the front which was slightly different.  I did notice that after the length of the tail there was no sign of a dim tail, it was totally dark as was the rest of the sky.  The objects moved off to the east at constant altitude.  The total episode taking from 30 seconds to as much as two minutes.  I was distracted by the pilots comments and then that it was a meteor so I didn't watch it continuously and really did not see the objects disappear.  I did notice that at some point they were no longer visible.  The trajectory of the objects was neither up or down in the vertical direction.  The witnesses included myself, the person sitting next to me and at least one pilot.  I am not sure about whether other people on the plane had noticed the event.  I am not sure of the time but believe it to be between 18:45 and 19:15 Eastern.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I was walking east when i looked up & noticed this thing going from north to south. It was changing shape from oblong to round then flat like a disk, almost like it was rolling NOT floating along. It was gray in color and would get shiny because of the setting sun on the west. This was weird! In Staten Island?? I dont know what it was, i thought maybe a balloon or something let loose(?). It did look like it was traveling a set path though, a definite direction. Luckily I had my camera with me and snapped a picture of it. And when the pic came back developed there were 2 of them! Is it possible for one thing on a snapshot to be double-exposed? Everything else on the photo is normal. I am sending the photo to you via postal mail for further professional examination, I would like to know what this was. Please inform me of your findings.

At approximately 16:15 hours, I went out to the East facing entrance of my office building for a cigarette break, I was accompanied by one of the Engineers (((name deleted))).  We each had a cigarette, he returned inside.  We were together about 3 min, a truck pulled up then the driver pulled the truck into the bay and went inside. I was looking up in the sky, as we have a very large crane in front of the building, I was looking at the top of the crane, amazed at its height.   (The crane being so tall was folded in half, or collapsed, there were no construction workers around anymore.) Looking East, there is an UPS office, with another larger building a block behind that one.  Over the top of the 2nd building, I was what appeared to be an airplane at a very high altitude. It appeared to be moving quite slow.  It was small, and appeared to be very high up (miles).  It was noticeably black in color. As it moved from East to West, I remarked to myself that it no longer looked like an aircraft, but it looked more like a flock of birds flying it a appeared to be in a formation.  This was not a strict V formation, as it looked sort of, well, like a flock of birds. Then the object stopped moving.   It seemed as if it was hovering, or just stopped moving. It remained in the same position for about 2-min, but the shape of the object changed again.  It looked more like a small black square, with a small protrusion on its side.  I do not recall actually seeing any physical change occur, but it was a different shape that when I first viewed it.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

The objects were like laser light and changing shape. they followed us quiete a while and we could see them from the windshield very clearly. My friend being a religous person claimed that they could be angels. The objects appeared to be around 50 meters above us. Those 4 object were seperating and coming back together again. If some kind of flying objects would follow us and take pictures or so, they would fly the same way they did. I have seen the same kind of object previously around September 1983 in Istanbul. The similar object was moving big distances very fast. ((NUFORC Note:  The report is reminiscent of four advertising lights in the night sky.  The sighting does not appear to us to be UFO-related.

Objects seen after WTC disaster in calm NEW YORK sky.;2001-09-20 15:00:00;10 Minutes;Objects seen after WTC disaster in calm NEW YORK sky. I was aprehensive about placing this report until I read some of the others, that seem to me may have been the same or a similar sighting. I was sitting on my couch one day, watching TV, and happened to look out my window. From my window I can see the East side of Manhatten, I am directly across from the United Nations building. In any case I saw what appeared to me at first to be birds flying. Like seagulls, when they just kind of float in the air. Their movement was like that two objects just kind of circling each other ove and over. It occured to me after a few seconds how high they were in the air. I got up to get a closer look, and sure enough they were not birds. My second though was military planes, like an F-14. This was in and around the time they were still patrolling over the City. But because of the movement, I would have to rule that one out too. They managed to saty there for about 10 minutes appearing and disappearing, reflecting light of some type of metallic surface. They were so far up it was hard to get a good read on its surface properties. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Black, elongated shape-shifter, floating/hovering in Manhatten NYC.;2001-10-15 15:00:00;5 minutes;Black, elongated shape-shifter, floating/hovering in Manhatten NYC. Ok, as a skeptic (most UFOS I would think are merely military dirigibles and unmanned drones) I wasn't really certain what i and my girlfriend had seen.  We pulled out of the Holland Tunnel in downtown NYC not far from Canal street, on our way to Brooklyn.  It was a beautiful day as the sun was shining and visibility was straight up (10,000ft ceiling maybe), and no cloud cover.  We were sitting in traffic for oh, maybe 2 minutes when something just above a building across from us caught my eye.  The distance, ground, was maybe 100 yards to the building, and vertically maybe 12 stories high.  The sun wasn't shining in our eyes nor was there any glare to obscure our clear path of vision.  This thing behaved like a living creature, it sat in the air just above this building and slowly rose and began to move horizontally over canal street.  Immediately i asked my girlfriend to look and comment on what she thought it was (still sitting in traffic we had ample time to peep it).  Her initial comment was that it was a string of black balloons floating carelessly in the air and rising upward, made sense to me judging its appearance, BUT balloons wouldn't behave like this thing did!  This idea of it being balloons was dashed against the rocks due to it's size and nature....was maybe 45 feet in length and altered its shape.   Allow me to explain in bulleted points:  1.  The object was hovering in place and changed direction a few times smoothly, against the breeze which was blowing.  Did not react to wind direction or speed, as the wind would gust. 2.  Object was close enough to the street (like 100 feet) that it would be affected by same wind we were. 3.  Was jet black and appeared to be almost like a giant oarfish moving in the air in a twisting fashion.  This thing had what seemed specific motions which were repeated over and over such as a sidewinder snake moves...deliberate and repetitive. 4.  Would stop, hover, twist, move, stop, hover, twist, move, etc. all the while changing shape from long and snakelike to rectangular and spherical. 5.  After floating and shape shifting above and around building (it wasnt tethered as the wind would whip it a certain way)it moved fast (maybe within 2 secinds time) the length of 3 blocks NE, then stopped to begin its dance again.  Then moved an opposite direction just as quickly and stopped. As it moved on it began to head due NE towards the east side and east river then ultimately dissappeared behind a large building maybe 6 blocks from my car, at this time it reached an altitude of maybe 350 feet then just vanished.  By now i had cars honking behind me followed by a barrage of profanity, so i had to move. Strangest thing i've ever seen...it truely looked like a snake or oarfish/eel floating in air anyone else see this thing?! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Laying on my bed looking out the window I saw an object moving at a constant velocity. I jumped up to get a closer look without taking my eyes away. The object changed shapes from circular to disclike (from my perspective)alternating every 2-3 seconds. It moved in one direction, did not change course, and seemed to be moving at a constant velocity ... slower than the planes I see taking off from a nearby airport. The object came near one airplane but neither seemed to change course (again, from my perspective). I've never seen anything like this before.

Then i noticed them lift up to sky in what seemed to be a sequence of  shapes.. it was 11:26 when i looked at my cell phone to check the time..and noticed they where flying just above trump towers on 56th and 5th ave..they started to change shapes once again and as they changed shapes they flew in a another sequence of patterns..one of the patterns was a circle then from a cirlcle the formed a triangle at this point the lights that were on this object to get brighter.. this went on for about 3 minutes..then all of a sudden there lites seemed to dim at this point they pattrened themself's into a straight line and flew towards central park and fanished... please excuse my writing i am still shook up from this ordeal;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
strange morphing cloud scans city at night;2002-11-19 00:45:00;5 min.;strange morphing cloud scans city at night My husband and I decided to go up to the rooftop to see if we could  catch a glimpse of the meteor shower last night. Because of the full moon and because of city lights visibility was very good. While looking northeast we noticed what looked like a string-like cloud in the very distinct shape of a bommerang moving towards us. It immediately caught our eye because it hung so low for a cloud and it moved at a steady clip. We kept watching it expecting it to dissipate but instead it continued on a steady path southward and began morphing into different shapes, ungulating as it moved in the way a deep-sea jelly fish might move. But this thing was much more elastic, at once spreading out like a string then shaping into a V, curling its tails around then gathering into more of a cloud shape and again stretching out. It sometimes broke up into little tails or simply stretched out uniformly, like someone pulling at taffy. It felt as if it was scanning the city, never rising, never dropping, justing floating by at a constant speed completely silent. We thought we saw faint lights at the ends of the tails and it shimmering in general. We also smelled a distinct acrid burn in the air, almost like an electrical fire, that would appear, disappear then reappear (in keeping with the ungulating nature of movement?). Our first reaction was it had something to do with the meteor showers, a terminal burst in the lower atmosphere. But then, not knowing what that looks like, I would expect that to have the characteristic of linear progression i.e. dying out, like striking a match. Instead this thing was in no way disappearing. It had the feeling of  living matter and we watched it continue its path through the city till it passed from our sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she sounded credible to us.

At first we thought it was a plane, but it was not. It hovered in the distance slightly  moving or shifting position.  It was not a helicopter either. It was just one light that seemed to spin or rotate while changing colors from white to blue and red, often changing shape as well.  Or pulsing, and blinking. Then we went outside to watch it and I measured it's shifting against the buildings.  We followed it further until about 1:45 AM, it was still hovering above the city but by now far in the distance.

It was triangular in shape but had buldges coming out of it.  As I continued to jog I noticed it began to morph/change shape.  It then changed into what looked like a bunch if grapes.  As I was following it, my girlfriend then noticed it and wondered what it was.  We both began to slow down and watch the object.  As we approached a street intersection waiting for the light to change so we can proceed w/ our jog, another person who was waiting to cross the street also noticed it and asked us if we are seeing what he was seeing.  At that moment, a commercial aircraft passed underneath it.  However the object continued to move slowly across the sky.  We continued our jog but I kept an eye on the object.

It was a cloud shape form very obscure yet with a flat and roating movement to it.  It was not a cloud it was in front of the clouds at sun set.  It began to change shape and move all the while changing in color due to the sun.  We took 9 photographs of the object and it changed shape moved across the city.  Turned at amazing angles.  Then conformed into a ball and shot straight up into the sky.  Going from a low altitutde to the outreach of space in a matter of seconds.  6minutes after the sighting while it was still in the sky a strange large black aircraft began to move in the general direction of the craft.  The photos are very strange and show an amazing object.  Thanks for listening!;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Orange tinged translucent amoeba like object moved upwards into sky until it became a speck of light that disappeared past moon;2008-12-13 21:00:00;10-15 minutes;Orange tinged translucent amoeba like object moved upwards into sky until it became a speck of light that disappeared past moon I've referred to the email I sent some friends over a decade ago to ensure my recollection is still the same.    The unusual sighting was during a supermoon of sorts (moon was 15% larger), very bright. I was on the 13th floor / penthouse and had stepped onto the terrace to appreciate the moon and sky. Not long after, I saw a couple of comets or meteors fall to the North - one appeared to be quite large (I later learned that the Geminid showers were happening during this time).  I can't recall if I had stepped back inside first or if I was outside the entire time. But, not long after the comets, from the North (Greenpoint, Brooklyn or Long Island City, Queens), I saw something in the sky heading South towards where I was. At first, I thought it may be a cluster of rogue helium balloons or a flock of birds. But, ironically, I also saw a flock of birds fly by in a v-shaped formation and this was not what I was witnessing.  I waited for 5, 10 minutes as this object or group of objects moved closer until I noticed that it was a large amorphous, seemingly organic shape moving slowly in the sky upwards. It was somewhat translucent with a tinge of orange. It would change shape as it moved. I described it to my friend that it looked like a ghost-like amoeba, undulating a bit while moving upwards. I distinctly remember I had closed and opened my eyes 3 times to make sure I was not hallucinating.  My camera was three flights below, and I did not know how long this object would be visible, so I continued to watch and wait for it to get closer to the moon so I could see it even better.  I then remembered that we had a telescope on the other side of the living room, which I retrieved. The moon was so bright that it hurt to try to locate the object, so I gave up and just watched with the naked eye as it continued past to the right of the moon from my vantage point until it was just a small bright glowing speck that finally disappeared.  One of my housemates returned home soon after, and he suggested it was probably a weather balloon. But after googling - it was clear that it was not a balloon of sorts that I saw.    The next day I googled to see if anyone else had mentioned the sighting of an amoeba like object, but nothing. It would have been easily seen by many but key words did not yield any posts. Additionally, nothing came up online of anyone ever having seen such an object before. I essentially got teased by friends who asked what I'd been smoking!  Subsequent to that sighting, I did actually witness a deflated weather balloon descend one afternoon, and it was completely different from what I'd seen. What I saw almost seemed to be swimming or moving upwards in a systemic fashion, and it did not appear solid. ;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
I'm back with another report only this time I'm not confused.;2010-07-17 00:00:00;Above Yankee Stadium;I'm back with another report only this time I'm not confused. I'm a Superintendant of a Residentual Building across the street from the Bronx Supreme Court and one block away from the Yankee Stadium.   My two nephiews and I were walked up to the roof to watch the amount of Yankee fans that came for the Old Timers Game.  Sure enough, as I last stated here back in July of (I think it was 1999), we witnessed them again, the first one appeared to us like fire directly above our heads it just spun around in a circular motion then just disappeared.  The second seemed like a star but it was too high up to say anything about it and was moving very rappidly also not in a steady motion. The third was astonishing. It was amazing but we were not surprised due to the fact we saw them before plenty of times just spending time up on roof-tops. It was close to the Supreme Court's roof just hovering straight across in a very slow-motion. It was an oval egg-shaped like object, about the size of a full-sized van and an orange or fire like color to it with no shine or light, just creeping across the sky. What got us was that about 3 minutes to the direction it headed towards there appeared to be a crime scene.  All of a sudden a Police helicopter flying in circles around the area and about 20 Police cars. Then we saw a fourth heading towards the same direction but this one appeared to be white.   A fifth was coming behind him, this was to the left of us while the other to the right of us.  This one startled us a little because it was very close, seemed to be coming towards us at head level then it rose up at about 50 feet above our heads, this one was very clear to us.  It was definatley oval, saucer like, with two blue lights going around in circles on the top center of it.  The lights were not bright at all, perhaps they weren't lights.  It then changed shape, seemed like two legs came out the backside of it then it crumbled like liquid metal and again back to it's solid shape and headed to the same direction as the other four. Five minutes had past and the sixth appeared behind us this time above the Yankee Stadium heading straight towards our direction also at head level and slowly towards the last fives' direction.  Then about two minutes later, five in a V shaped formation headed straight across the sky for about ten seconds and just vanished before our eyes, again towards the same direction as the last six before them. I stopped wrighting to the National Ufo Reporting Center because I wasn't getting any answers.  I was going through a lot of great disturbing confusion and wanted to point the finger at all the wrong places.   Instead I decided to ask, what ever I was looking at, for answers.  This is all I wanted to share for now, it makes no sence what-so-ever for me to dwell into this because the life experiences I have had lead me to believe and understand that folks all over the world will always be blinded by the truth and wouldn't believe it if these crafts were pointed out to them.  Yet a large amount of us believe and preach that there is a God but don't have enough faith to understand the huge fact that heaven is directly above our heads, in space, there are millions of angelic and demonic beings, or just normal like you and I, watching over us or just living their lives out there in different worlds.  We don't have all the answers as facts because we all need to find faith in order ! to get the answers we want or wait untill we die.  That's what makes us God's favorite creation, remember that we are a creation from above.  I searched for many answers during my first experiences and I found many answers with nobody's help.  There will be a time when they will reveil themselves to us with or without the approval of our so-called-leaders. If you believe what I am saying and search for aswers using faith from God then they have a special place for you.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Brooklyn lights / VIDEO / 5.14.11;2011-05-14 02:50:00;20 minutes;Brooklyn lights / VIDEO / 5.14.11 On the early morning of Sat. 5/14/11, I was having great trouble sleeping.  The cable box in my room was re-booting most of the night, indicating, perhaps, an electrical or signal problem.   From my kitchen window----from about 2:50am to 3:10am, I, and for a portion of the time with a friend, observed a brilliant display of light near Windsor Terrace (Brooklyn).  The light changed shapes, sizes, brightness, etc. VIDEO BEING PROVIDED:  Near the end I observed a brilliant increase in brightness which I was able to video and which is being e-mailed to NUFORC. I am not 100% certain if this display could have been a craft or natural event. This is my third UFO sighting report to NUFORC.  The other two were for sightings that took place on:   1.  2/6/97 (Mesa, AZ)---original report was updated with map. 2.  4/26/09 (Brooklyn, NY)---orb;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

We were driving to the city of Manhathan on the Long Island Expressway.  The traffic was heavy and we were moving very slow, when i saw something that looks like a very bright blue airplane. I told my daughters l&quotlook&quot I was just going to play with them.  Suddenly the object turn around unexpectedly  going  north of the LIE, when it turns we saw like 2 lines of lights in a very bright blue and red.  The object move further north and then it came back again. Looks like it was just playing in the sky.   I was still driving but my daughters keep looking at it until we were gone.

Sept. 2013 Sunset Park sighting Debunked..;2013-10-04 20:30:00;ongoing;Sept. 2013 Sunset Park sighting Debunked.. In response to sighting on this forum in Sunset Park Brooklyn on 9/28/13, of 3 white lights moving erratically behind clouds. I saw the same thing.  It is an advertisement for a dance club in Long island City Queens. They use a type of L.E.D. spotlight which illuminates the clouds causing an illusion that the light is coming from behind the clouds.  They also put off very little, if any beam.  L.E.D. lights have a very long range, so they can appear to be moving several miles very quickly.  These particular lights can be seen on most Friday and Saturday nights when it is cloudy.  They are visable anywhere from Brooklyn to almost the South Bronx. Sorry!  I was quite perplexed myself at first.  I was a little Bummed when I found out.  They are weird though!;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
oval , yellow-orange ball swept the northen sky in flashing speed;2014-06-29 22:13:00;<2 seconds;oval , yellow-orange ball swept the northen sky in flashing speed Witnessed a very bright, ellipticle-shaped, yellowish/orange oval ball move quickly from left to right in a slight arc in the northern, clear sky.  The streak/tail length was about a long city block, perhaps two considering wheere I was standing in front of my home.  The stars were against the background sky canvas and in a clear sky. The speed was faster than an aircraft even from visual from ground distance.  There was no cherry bombing or rockets sounds.  It seems that it could have been about a 1-2 seconds and abruptly ceased.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Flying Spacecraft's invasion ,abducting airplane,hiding out in my attic of my home and a prisoner.;2015-03-22 22:00:00;Night time;Flying Spacecraft's invasion ,abducting airplane,hiding out in my attic of my home and a prisoner. My home is one block East from Henry Hudson Pk. Way, and I was looking out from my mother's window looking up in the sky to notice this big bright light of a space craft rotating itself to a different shape.  Then it went in the area of Henry Hudson Pk. Way.  I notice an air plane was passing by this unusual spacecraft that's when the space craft was shooting some kind of light at it that the air plane was struggling in flying a head and it was a stand still in the air as if this object was trying to duck the airplane to get into this object.  Then when another airplane flew near the both of them that's when that airplane was about to disappeared was lucky to break through this force.  I thanked God that the airplane was freed from this unknown object in the air.  I wish for someone to come to where I am and you will get to see what goes on here.  I am not joking and this is not a hoax neither.  I am more convinced that the little air crafts that are shape like Diamonds have landed on my roof.  I heard all kinds of weird sounds as if someone is using an electric saw or something to slice meat.   At 23:00 I notice the many little Diamond shape crafts that surround my home as if I was their prisoner . I hear all kinds of sounds in the Attic.  I hear  singing of some dong as if they were going to Kill someone.  I believe its called a say sons. When I lay down on my bed I feel a burnt pain  on my foot and to notice i see a beam of yellow light hitting my feet. I yelled out loud to stop it that they are hurting me.  Then i dont hear any sounds and dont see any beam of light flashing down on my feet.  About five mins. later they do it again with them using their beam of light on me.  I dont know what they are going to do with me either kill me or have me converted to be like them. I know what I am writing to you may sound that its off the wall but its the Gods Truth.  I have filled out more than one of these forms and no one has made the effort to come out to where I am to investigate this.  Oh, another thing that they control your use of the internet, laptop and phone use that you have to get ou! t from your home to go dome where else to call,text or what ever you may need to use your cellphone. I urge for someone to come here and its a must!;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Morphing light being in NY.;2015-09-17 14:00:00;10 minutes;Morphing light being in NY This UFO appeared over the skies of lower Manhattan after a focused sky gazing CE5 Meditation on September 17, 2015.  The orb appeared out of no where and was brightly lit.  This was the second one to appear in 2 days, but this time I was armed with a camera. After zooming in, it appears to have been morphing in what looked like a cross from a set of balloons and a cauliflower.   It eventually vanished into thin air shortly after the video.   Usually during visual meditations, I see UFO craft on an almost weekly basis and sometimes more in the NYC sky. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwVVmqCx4sQ   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbNNmvPwM7A;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Shape shifting, teleporting UFO.;2016-03-08 11:45:00;1-8 minutes;Shape shifting, teleporting UFO I was in my room, in front of my large window looking at men cutting down city trees.  I looked up at the men, since they were at the very top, and saw something that caught my eye.  At first, thinking that this was just an aluminum balloon,  That object was sturdy, still, and in the clear sky.  Light flashing out of the object, but this wasn't an ordinary light.  It very bright, and soon, the light started to pulse.  Following after that, it changed shape. Originally shaped like a triangle, and each light was on its coordinated areas.  Followed up by a square, and lastly a circle.   At this point, I called my daughter, because i feared that I was looking at a hallucination.  Thankfully, I wasn't the only witness.  She saw this object too, and we were freaking out at this point.  Watching, talking, and staring at what possible movements this could have done.   It then, started to move very slowly, stopped, gained speed and disappeared.  My daughter even ran outside to check our backyard, to see if it might've been there.  However, it just completely disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We attempted to contact the source of this report via telephone, but were unsuccessful.  We are undecided as to whether this was submitted as a serious-minded report.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Golden bars shaped like a sphere with a glowing light inside of it, gliding towards us.;2016-08-30 20:00:00;1 hour;Golden bars shaped like a sphere with a glowing light inside of it, gliding towards us. at around eight pm, eastern time.  I was sitting on the back porch with my roommate.  We were observing everything in the sky as usual.  For some reason this night we noticed more airplane activity than usual.  i kept noticing to the right of me there was a object in the air with red and green lights, but it was just hovering over some buildings.  it had to be at least four blocks away from us.  About ten minutes later the object dropped rapidly and then came back up, the red and green lights were still lit up on the object the whole time hovering over the same location.  my roommate and i were trying to figure out whats going on and what is it.  I thought it was a drone or something.  Around 8:45 pm we noticed a small,white, clear, rectangular shaped object gliding around the corner towards us.  As it came closer i noticed a bright light in side of the object that looked like a light bulb. it was gliding towards us slowly.  The object was actually within our reach.  The object changed its form into a golden sphere, but it looked like a cage that was shaped into a sphere.  It was still gliding towards us, the object still had the golden light inside of it.  The object flew higher and started to travel to the right of us, i caught that part on video.  The object changed its form again into some sort of mechanical ball, it then folded itself and disappeared.  My room mate started to scream dial 911, and I called channel 7 news.  I was told to send in the pictures.  I was terrified because i could not understand what was going on.  I called all my friends and family to tell them what i just witnessed.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
UFO spotted next to One World Trade Center tower;2016-10-19 16:08:00;UNKNOWN;UFO spotted next to One World Trade Center tower My partner and I were on holiday in New York city in October 2016.  On the 19th of October at around 4.08 pm, we were at the 9/11 memorial taking photos of the new tower.  A couple of weeks earlier, whilst watching the pictures that I took on my phone during my holiday, I noticed an odd shaped blue object sitting next to the One World Trade Center tower.  I first thought that it was just an optical effect due to the reflection of the sunlight on my camera lens.  Then I remembered that my girlfriend was also taking photos with her phone of the same tower at the same time. I took her phone and looked closely at her pictures and unsurprisingly, the same object is on 2 other photos taken with her phone.  However, it seems having a slightly different shape on the pictures that she took compared to mine. I'm not sure how long this object was sitting there for as we did not see it on the spot but it is likely to have appeared/disappeared very quickly.  We have several pi! ctures of the same tower but the object only appears on 3 of them.  So we estimate that it was present for a very short time (no more than a few seconds).;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
