Metallic UFO over Upper Manhattan;1986-05-15 17:40:00;40 mins;Metallic UFO over Upper Manhattan I was in the livingroom when I heard my mum call me to the kitchen.  She yelled for me to come quick.   As I got there, I saw her looking out of the window and she said that there was a ufo in the sky.  I thought she was mistaken, that perhaps it was a kite or she was kidding around until I reached the window which is on the 6th story bldg and saw a brass colored V shaped object floating in the southeastern sky.  The thing was slowing rotating around w/o a sound.   I was shocked, not scared but intrigued.  I ran to get a small telescope to see it closer.  The object had a circle-like large porthole in the end part of the V.  It did not look like a window and it was the same color as the brass metal.  The UFO turned and rotated over and over.  As it did, the V would become an L and then cigar and back again to an L and a V over and over.  It was a clear sky with a few clouds and the object was just around cloud level or roughly 2,000 ft. My mum said that they were communicating to her, saying that they were friendly.  I just looked at her and disbelieved her.  She said that she asked when are they coming and that they replied soon, very soon.  She also said that it had a haze around it which I didnt see.   My mum actually liked the episode, I felt a little creepy but not frightened.  My dad arrived and we told him to go look.  He did and was fascinated also, almost amused.  He kind of looked happy and he was not the type of person to smile easily.   This UFO was affecting my parents moods into being jovial I thought.  We all looked silently until the craft flew out of our line of sight towards the Northeast which I didnt want it leave.  I told my parents that I was 100% sure they knew we spotted them and they may have trained their visual aids on us, maybe even photographed us.   I had a strong sensation that our images were captured to be shown in their world. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

St. Patrick's Day 1987 - Lights over the Bronx, NY;1987-03-17 21:00:00;15 Minutes;St. Patrick's Day 1987 - Lights over the Bronx, NY St. Patrick's day, Bedford Park section of the Bronx. Walking across a large street (205 St.) I looked up and saw a perfect v-shaped formation of brilliant lights. It moved slowly and silently and the lights looked like they were attached to something or affixed to eachother. The lights changed color in perfect unison and in almost a swirling fashion. It was SW of where we were walking and it appeared to be huge. It was stunning and I immediately felt emotional looking at it. My friends looked at it after I yelled out. They were reluctant to talk about it then or afterward. There was a blurb on the 11:00 local news that night due to numerous calls about lights in the sky. They said they were told (by whom I'm not sure) that it was a formation of aircraft. The explanation didn't make sense then and it still doesn't. I'm hoping someone else out there saw it.

Satellites searching area before and after   2 chevron UFO 's were seen.;2000-06-03 23:30:00;1 hour;Satellites searching area before and after   2 chevron UFO 's were seen. I'm a video technician presently employed at the D.A. s office. My duties are to document crime scene evidence and statements from defendents.This is actually my second UFO sighting,in June 1982 on a clear sunny day I was walking with my older brother who is also an ameteur  astronomer. We  saw a large cylinder shaped metallic object approximately  150 ft in length hovering about 10,000 ft. The UFO made no sound, it just floated for about 2 minutes, it then became smaller in size and began moving north. We lost sight of it. On 6/3/00 at about 11:30pm my wife returned from having dinner. I stood at the window  looking out at the harbor and the New York skyline. We have a pretty good view from our top floor apartment and could see for miles. The evening was cool and the night sky was clear. I looked up at the big dipper and  saw a small object like a star moving north to south across the big dipper. I thought it could have been a satellite and I wanted my wife to see it, however the object vanished. About 15 minutes later a second object appears inthe same area also moving north to south. At this point I was already on the fire escape with my binoculars. Unfortunately for my wife she was already in the shower. I sat patiently looking up at the night sky for about another 15 minutes, then saw 2 chevron shaped UFO's circuling next to the dipper.They stopped and faced eachother then continued circuling. I remember thinking  that these had to be birds flying around at night but when I looked at them through my binoculars I saw 2 boomerangs slowly circuling in the sky. I immediately became exited and had to rub my eyes to make sure I was not seeing things. I watched these objects for a few seconds, they were a dull biege color with a soft brownish glow or haze, One of the UFO'S was wider then the other and looked more like a large hand glider while the other object had a much more alien appearance to it. They had no lights  or windows though they appeared to reflect some light. It was difficult to determine s! ize beca use they were dull however when looking at them through my binoculars I could tell that they large objects, probably 100 to 150 ft wide and hovering about 10,000 ft up.I realized that I had to get my wife to see this. I began knocking on the bathroom door pleading for her to come out and see these things. she came out but  they had  already dissappeared. Together we continued watching for about another 15 -20 minutes.Then we observed a third satellite moving in the opposite direction across the dipper. That night I couldn't sleep thinking about what I saw. The next morning we talked about it and decided that what we saw were either real extraterrestrial crafts coming in from space circuling over the city and then moving back out to space or military satellites trying to track the two chevron UFO's. What's also strange is that this incident occurred exactly 18 years after the first one and for the past few weeks prior to the second sighting I've been getting this feeling that I was going to see something again. Could we be right about what we saw and have other people had similar feelings prior to seeing a UFO?;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
chevron shaped object sighting during Leonid meteor shower;2001-11-19 02:00:00;~15 sec.;chevron shaped object sighting during Leonid meteor shower I submitted this report before, but it was not entered into the database. One chevron shaped object sighted moving SW to NE during Leonid meteor shower. Conditions were excellent: very clear skies, no moon or wind. Object was originally thought to have dull orange glow, but it is more likely object was reflecting light from high-pressure Sodium streetlights used in NYC (same color was seen reflected from passing aircraft, birds, etc before). No sound was heard during or after sighting that could be attributed to sighting. Object moved in a straight direction and was out of sight in about 15 seconds. No skidding was noted of the object during length of sighting. There were no lights visible on the object.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Two Chevrons over New York City;2003-11-08 20:30:00;15 MINUTES;Two Chevrons over New York City During the lunar eclipse, Two Chevrons, or open triangular objects consistings of round, grey or white globes were in the sky over New York City. I observed both of these objects with Leitz 7x35 Trinovid Binoculars. All of the reports in the metro area are similar to what I observed. 10 to 15 glass like globes no lights moving in a triangular shape. They were not birds. Balloons, not quite filled to capacity, tethered by lose wire maybe. What throws me however, were the distances involved with some of the similar sitings. The other thing was not being able to really judge the distance, size, and altitude of both these objects. I spot airplanes, birds,satellites, all the time at night. The speed of these objects was leisurely.  I had three of the greyish globes close up in my eyes. It was very hard to estimate size, altitude and the specifics closer up. I don't know why.  Before this, there was a triangle, glider, space shuttle shaped object moving at high speed from the northwest to the southeast. No lights No sound. 10 or 15 minutes before the previous sighting. Straight line. Just under the moon. Similar observations from the area also. Thanks.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
V-shaped translucent object seen near the moon during the eclipse;2003-11-08 21:15:00;15 minutes;V-shaped translucent object seen near the moon during the eclipse I'm writing this email to tell you about an interesting occurrence I (and three others) had as we were outside to view the eclipse of the moon in NYC on November 8th, 2003. As I was looking up at the orange-shaded moon waiting for the last sliver of it to be covered, I noticed a strange V-shaped pattern, or triangular shaped pattern of lights moving in the sky. I believe my comments, along with some of the others, were: What's that? ..that triangular shaped thing? Do you see that? We were all mystified.  This V-shaped object was extremely high up in altitude, higher than any plane I've ever seen flying, and moved just under the moon, towards it, then disappeared. It had about 8 round Shapes (probably lights, though it was too high up for me to see the illumination of these lights).  There were about four round shapes on each limb of the 'V' shape, and the whole shape seemed somewhat translucent.  Many planes had passed through the crisp crystal-clear sky as I was viewing the moon for a duration of about 15 minutes. All of the other planes had very bright lights, took routine pathways and were easily identified as planes. This V-shaped, triangular object was quite different from the planes. It had more lights on it than a plane and the lights appeared transparent or translucent. And, it was so high up that it appeared as if it was the same distance as the moon!  Then, it disappeared  as it seemed to fly towards the moon. This triangular, V-shaped object was something else!  I remember thinking that possibly a V-formation of ducks could be traveling (but in the dark at night). Perhaps, we (Earthlings) weren't the only beings sending good vibrations to the Universe during the Harmonic Concordance that night??  Regards, ((name deleted));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Night of the lunar eclipse, we saw in the sky two gray v-shaped objects flying side-by-side, no lights, no sound.;2004-10-27 22:15:00;1-2 minutes;Night of the lunar eclipse, we saw in the sky two gray v-shaped objects flying side-by-side, no lights, no sound. At approx. 10:15 pm the night of the lunar eclipse, my 13-yr. old son and I were observing the moon inside Central Park (near Strawberry Fields).  As he was looking through binoculars at the moon, I was gazing up at the rest of the sky, marveling at the stars (which is a real pleasure when you live in the city).  What the hell is that? I said out loud as soon as I saw the phenomenon.  Up in the sky, about as high as an airplane would fly over Manhattan, at a 45 degree angle to the south away from the eastern-rising moon, were two separate v-shaped solid gray metallic objects flying side by side, not touching, same speed, apex pointed directly due south.  There were no lights and no sound.  They were clearly visible against the black, cloudless sky with the city lights & moonlight reflecting their v shape and gray color.  They moved together, silently, steadily across the sky toward midtown.  We lost sight of them in the lights over mid-Manhattan.  Whole episode couldn't have lasted longer than two minutes.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Observed a round boomerang shaped object gliding through the sky;2019-05-25 20:19:00;90 seconds;Observed a round boomerang shaped object gliding through the sky Three people sitting in a backyard in Brooklyn observed a round boomerang shaped object flying across the sky.  It was at first thought to be a parachute but did not have a person or weight attached- and instead of gliding like a parachute, it was advancing steadily through the sky as a plane would.  There was no visible engine nor trails, and it was completely silent.  It appeared to be moving south towards the north at a airplane like speed, and disappeared out of view behind the buildings.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
