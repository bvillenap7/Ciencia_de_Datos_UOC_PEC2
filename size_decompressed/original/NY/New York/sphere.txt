While I realize this is reaching a bit far back, I believe this is an important sighting, and should be reported.;1970-09-22 23:00:00;three hours;While I realize this is reaching a bit far back, I believe this is an important sighting, and should be reported.  It was around 11:00 PM on a fall night in 1970.  I lived in an apartment house in New York City's Lower East Side.  A number of friends in the building had dropped in, and it seemed that a casual party was taking place.  It was a tiny apartment, and quickly filled up with cigarette smoke.  I suggested that we all go up to the roof to chat, where there was more oxygen available.  We all grabbed our drinks and smokes and paraded up three flights to the roof.  Everyone was talking at once, having a good time.  I noticed that the sky had a very dark, high overcast, and there were no stars visible at all.  In a few minutes, I saw that the moon had risen, and was near the horizon behind a little storm cloud with lightning going on in it, which was odd since no other clouds were visible.  I remember nothing else until I became aware of the fact that all of the people I was with were silent, staring blankly at the rooftop, and I was the only one who seemed conscious. Then, all at once everyone began talking as if there had been no break in the conversation at all.  I saw that the moon was much higher, and on the opposite side of the sky, but that it still had the little storm around it, with lightning.  Suddenly everyone had to get to bed, even though we'd only been there for a few minutes.  It was two AM when I got back to my apartment.  The next day I recalled the odd appearance of the moon, so I checked a calendar with the Moon's phases, and it had been a New Moon, with no visible Moon at all.  Needless to say, the event left my eyebrows raised for quite some time.  Thanks again for your work at keeping this magnificent repository available for the sharing of all our strange sightings.  Reading about others' experiences makes the strangeness seem a bit less frightening.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
A small gray ball moved past my bedroom window on the 15th floor of a New York City apartment building.;1977-01-01 19:30:00;30-60 seconds;A small gray ball moved past my bedroom window on the 15th floor of a New York City apartment building. I was four years old and had just been sent to bed by a babysitter. I didn't feel like sleeping so I knelt in my bed and leaned on my windowsill looking out at the city. Almost at once there was a small dark gray or possibly metallic ball moving steadily past my window. It was about 8-10 inches in diameter and had no distinguishing features at all. There was no sound or light associated with the ball. It was probably about 6-12 inches away from the side of the building and moved from left to right, which would have corresponded roughly to moving north. Our apartment was on the 15th floor and the window faced west-ish. (It faced in the direction of central park from the east side which is roughly due west.) The ball was not moving very quickly and I remember thinking that if I ran I would have time to get my babysitter to show her the ball before it had moved past the window. Which I did but of course when we got back to my room it was gone. I hadn't anticipated the time it would take to find her and convince her to come to my room.

We saw it droped down to like the 8floor ( we lived on the 13thfloor) and shoot stright out towrds P.S. 102 that was across a park from us the the ball cast the red light on the school and went stright up into the sky and was gone. we all stared yelling trying to tell our parent what happend and we got punished because they thought we were lying. now im 28 and my brother 32 and we both remember the event with exact detal.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Very nice indeed with great air quality that night.I was on duty and doing guard. The premises are outdoors and are guarded by guard and dogs in strategic positioning.While outside and on top of the small roof overlooking the night and starry sky. I distinctly recall the perfect night and how the stars were out. Then as i positioned to my left and towards lower manhattan side i noticed what seemed to be a shooting star. It was bright and streaking with a blue red into the atmosphere. I was amazed first as i thought it a rare chance to see a shooting star. But as i expected it to fizzle out. It only went distant and stopped seemingly pulsating. I was thinking this is odd. Then the pulsing had in a flash moved east as if by a enormous speed and in a  seeming instant. I was now really getting a bit curious and also uncertain what i was expecting. Then i noticed another pulsing closer and i was now sure this was more than odd. Within a flash i looked up and there directly by some amazing unexplained way i was seeing this enormous craft that was very sophisticated and truly unimaginable. The outer side was running a thousand patterns of seemingly colored lights in some sort of sequence. Yet somehow i looked towards the center directly above me and saw movement as if something was being done within the opening as it seemed to turn. But i didn't know what it was doing.Yet i also knew that if i could see this craft here in a borough of ny city then this may have a cloaking ability or some type of force to disguise or hide itself if necessary for its own advantages.I knew that in a instant just by its presence. That i was just nervous and almost wishing for what happened when it just ascended into the upper heights directly above then did the zipping movement into the distance where i saw a pulsation again and then it zipped out. This i almost never share due to its circumstance and the nature of our being on earth. But i feel this event had shown me there are real di! mensions to other realms of being and a extreme degree of sophistication and who knows what else around . Moreso who knows what was in that craft as i don't think i want to be too sure.Even writing this gives me the butterflies.This is a true event as i experienced.

Black sphere hovering over lower Manhattan.;1997-07-01 18:00:00;1 min;Black sphere hovering over lower Manhattan. It was up in the sky in a partly cloudy late afternoon.  I was riding the M14 bus going Eastbound on 14th  street after finishing my shift.   I looked out of the window where I saw a black ball suspended in the Eastern sky.  I blinked several times thinking I was seeing things but there it remained.  At first I thought it was part of the building's fixtures but as the bus continued on its route, the ball remained fixed in the sky while the structures went by.   The distance of the object was like holding a ballbearing at arms' length.  The sphere was below cloud deck.   I was transfixed, wondered what it was, knew what it was and wondered again if the sky opened a hole and if it was space I was seeing.   After I got off my stop it was hard to find it, with so many obstructions.   To this day, I wonder where it came from and what the occupants look like though I get a chill since I get the sensation that they aren't human looking.

Looking out the car window I noticed birds flying eraticly into trees. Just then My father and I noticed a Very bright silver ball wobbleling across the sky infront of us. The object was bright silver Round or sphereical with a belt of slightly darker silver acrossit's equator region. It wobbled like crazy but flew in a straight line. We lost sight of it as it passed behind a tree and then a building. At that time the light changed and we spead to our driveway to catch it as it passed over my back yard(which was in it's flight path).  But it never passed! it must have excelerated or disappeared. It could not have landed because there are to many houses in the area, I asked around and we were the only ones who witnessed it.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I was on the New Jersey side of the Hudson river watching F-16's flying over the city that day.  It was then I noticed what looked like a chrome ball bearing in the sky.  Every time the planes moved towards the object it would move Its position.  The object moved in a way that conventional aircraft cannot.  It would moved from side to side up then down while covering large distances in a split second.  When the object did move it would remain stationary until it moved again.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Eleven objects over Manhatten for nearly 2 hours.;2002-09-08 16:00:00;1-2hr;Eleven objects over Manhatten for nearly 2 hours. At approximately 1600 hours on the 8th of September I witnessed a number of UFO's with another person. We were in Central Park in NYC and I was laying down in the shade looking straight up in to the sky. I noticed one object that looked to be circular and white, I thought it was a satellite or maybe a planet. I didn't think much of it until I noticed that it had not moved for several minutes. I pointed the object out to my friend and asked if it could have been the planet Venus since sometimes you can see it during the day and it obviously was not a satellite since it had not moved. As we were both discussing it we noticed that it had started to move. Then my friend pointed out another one in a different part of the sky. As we looked around we started to see more and more. We watched as the slowly moved in different directions and at one point three of the objects formed in a shape of a triangle (probably several miles apart) and then slowly moved back into a straight line and then went in completely different directions. The most interesting event was when one of the objects looked as though it completely changed form and turned from a sphere into a longer thinner object. This object moved at a high rate of speed across the sky in a movement that  could most closely be described as  sperm-like.  Due to it's speed, this object was only seen for about 45 seconds before it moved out of sight. The rest of the objects very slowly moved apart from each other or too high for us to see.  The final talley of the objects was eleven. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  We spoke with him over the telephone, and found him to be serious-minded and quite credible.

Small silver orbs moving among Manhattan skyscrapers, morning and evening events;2002-12-17 10:30:00;20 seconds;Small silver orbs moving among Manhattan skyscrapers, morning and evening events getting coffee from a coffee cart on the corner of Broadway and 43rd Street, glanced east and saw a small (about two or three feet) silverish orb with two slowly blinking lights on the bottom moving west over 43rd Street directly next to the Grace building about 20 stories up.  I thought it was some sort of balloon toy or even paper blowing on the wind.  The object had an unsteady movement as if being moved around by the wind.  However, the object was NOT falling but proceeding horizontally.  When it reached 6th Avenue (one block away from my position) it made a 90-degree turn against the wind, without changing it's altitude, and continued south and out of view behind the Conde Nast tower.  It gave me a creepy feeling like it was some sort of probe or reconnaissance device.  I believe in UFOs but have never seen anything as bizarre as this in my life, and I consider myself a pretty stable person. Later the same day, just past sunset, I was walking south on 7th Avenue, from 42nd Street to 34th Street.  Around 40th Street I noticed several block south there were three more objects like the one I had seen earlier in the day, about as high up.  They were quite small in the distance but I could see the same slowly blinking lights on the bottom.  The three moved, variously, horizontally and vertically over the avenue, and then grouped together and moved downwards a few floors in altitude.  then they stopped their downward motion and moved horizontally (no downward movement) towards a building on the east side of the street and proceeded, next to it, to move out of sight down whichever side street they were over (somewhere in the mid-thirties). In no case could I make out any details on the objects beyond the lights on the bottom, which appeared red or orange. I'm a professional working in Times Square.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Silverly helium balloon-like object;2003-05-29 08:36:00;2 minutes;Silverly helium balloon-like object I was on may way to the subway (Manhattan #6 line), walking along 68th Street beween 2nd and 3rd Avenues when I noticed a round silvery ball shaped object very high above the city against the blue sky.  It seemed to be moving slowly northeast.  The bright sun was reflecting off its surface.  One could say it appeared to be floating or drifting.  It could have definetly been a small helium balloon caught in the air currents. My impression is that it was at least as large as a basketball.  It was way too high to determine what it was.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Watch Spherical object for 15 Minutes over Brooklyn;2003-07-13 18:15:00;15 Minutes;Watch Spherical object for 15 Minutes over Brooklyn I had just finished a bike ride in Marine Park and went across the street to the Salt Marshes to unwind from the ride.  The view from the back of the parks department building is beautiful and peaceful. Plus the view is clear to the horizon, which is very rare in Brroklyn.  While I was looking out over the Marsh, I saw a flash of light from the sky.  I looked up and saw the usual planes comming and going because I live close to JFK and La Guarida Airports. But there was an object comming up from the south and heading in a Northerly direction that did look like or act like a jet.  This object which I watched for 15 minutes was spherical in shape and had a light gray metalic color to it.  It was high above the clouds which made it impossible to see any other features on this craft.  I did not see any flashing lights on it either. At first the craft was comming up from the south in a straight line.  What made it different from the jets is that is was wobbling as it was moving and it wasn't on the same path as all the other jets were. The weather this day was clear with a few fair weather clouds in the sky.  I know that it was high up because a cloud passed in front of it and I lost sight of it for a moment, while all the jets in the area were flying below the clouds.  After watching for several minutes, the craft went off its course and started following one of the jets that was heading in an easterly direction. What bothered me it that the craft descended a bit while doing this and I thought for a moment it was going to crash into the jet. As this was happening a cloud was passing by and I noticed that the craft went behind the cloud and the jet was in front of it which means there must of still been some height distance between the two. Then the unidentified craft switched directions and start heading away from the jet in a westerly direction.  It did that for a couple of minutes, then turned into a northerly direction.  The craft was getting closer to me, not straight above me but still ! on an angle when a large cloud came by.  It took a couple of minutes for the cloud to pass.  When it did the craft was gone.  As a said earlier I watched this craft for 15 minutes before it went behind the large cloud.  It was not moving fast at all, more like a slow meandering pace.  I am somewhat interested in UFO's and have visited this site in the pass to see what's going on in the tri-state area.  I probably  would not have filed this report if I hadn't seen two other reports from my area on the same day.  I've never seen anything like this in the 43 years I've been alive.

We also saw 2 dots revolving around each other and flashing brightly. At that time, as we were looking at the dots, two commercial airliner almost collided! It was very bizzare and all 7 of us agreed that this sighting was something from a different planet. What made it even more bizzare was the amount of military aircraft that followed.

On the night of the blackout I noticed a strange object hovering over the darkened Manhattan skyline. It appeared to be round and silver colored (very bright). Red lights were revolving around it on what looked like a 'ring'. These revolving red lights were what got my attention. They rotated & flashed on the 'ring' non-stop. The travel path of the red lights convinced me I wasn't seeing a helicopter since they were circling a *round* or *oblong* object.  It remained stationary for approx 3-4 hours then disappeared from view around midnight - 1AM. I did not see it 'leave' the sky. I turned my attention from the window and when I looked out again it was gone.  The UFO remained over the skyline for approx 3 hours. I have never seen this object over Manhattan before & as far as I know it did not 'return' the following evening. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the sighting, as described by the witness, is not inconsistent with a sighting of the planet, Mars, in the eastern sky over New York City.

I was on my break at work,(10:10 AM), and went out on the roof.I looked up and saw a sphere very high up over The Helmsley Palace Hotel. It was silvery in color and did not move for approximately 2 minutes.I went and called a co-worker. We both watched it hover for maybe another 2-3 minutes. It seemed to be fading in and out. Then it began to move north very slowly and it disappeared behind a building. Approximately 11:45 AM, I went back to the roof to look for it again, and this time it seemed to be 2 spheres that merged into 1 in front of my eyes! It seemed to hover around the same area as before, then started to move very, very slowly, stopped for 30 seconds, and continued to move east and once again disappeared behind a building. Once again I went back to the roof, this time about 12:20 PM. I looked around and did not see anything. I was about to leave when I looked straight up in the sky and saw what looked like a stretched oval shape, that reminded me of an airplane wing. It was brownish in color. It moved south at a faster speed, more like an airplane speed,for 15 seconds. It then stopped and hovered for 30 seconds. It did a maneuver of 3 to 4 very tight circles. At the last circle it disappeared behind a building. I watched until it re-emerged in about a minute, it did 1 more circle, only to disappear behind a building once again.From the roof of the building I have seen blimps, balloons,airplanes, helicopters, and jet fighters,(after 911), but have never seen anything move like this!

It was approximately 7:30 p.m. Within sight range as I walked, I saw a glowing whitish neon-green orb shoot through the sky, going south west, faintly lighting up the night. I stopped in my tracks. It moved as fast as a shooting star, straight on the horizon, about 30,000 ft. up (perhaps more or perhaps less difficult to gauge). It was huge, the size of a tennis ball, perfectly spherical, and left a tail in its wake. It receded as it moved away from me in a straight line, then vanished into the darkness. Perhaps it was a piece of space junk or a meteor. I've never seen anything like it before in my life.  Personal Background: I am a magazine/book editor and writer.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Silver orb seen in over central park.;2004-04-30 15:00:00;5 minutes;Silver orb seen in over central park. I was walking around central park, looking for a place to sit where there weren't too many people. I'm sorry I can't be more sure of the exact time, but I was working on a screenplay all day and was a little but pre-occupied with my own thoughts. At any rate, ust off the 80's of the west side of central park there is a large field with three baselball diamonds. I rested for a while looking at the game, when as I stood, I caught a glimpse of what I thought was a child's balloon (the silver kind) floating away, above the trees. It was clearly evident. However, it seemed to change shape, and flatten slightly, then round back out again. And it was pulled in a consistently western direction. This didn't seem to me like the normal behavior of a floating balloon. As I recall, they usually wobble from side to side as the tie at the bottom swings the weight around. There was nothing like this that I witnessed. It seemed to be moving deliberately. to see it clearly for more than about a minute and a half necessitsated walking over the baseballe diamond, which I neglected to do, as there was a game playing. Or, more accurately, a man was hitting balls for practice and others were catching it. So I only saw it briefly. The object was silver, I could not judge the distance accurately, and so cannot judge the size accurately. It seemed like a blimp, at times, which it may have been. but it appeared to flatten and behave more like a balloon. I could not identify it, hence I'm entering this report. It changed shape as it moved, or at least it seemed to. There was a lot of light in the sky, it was overcast but not directly sunny, with a white, bright sky. It read as silver to my eyes, not emmenating light. It must have been either a blimp, far away, but moving very quickly to cover the distance it did in the sky, or a balloon, moving very slowly, but deliberately. Or something else, I suppose. If anyone else saw this, I would like them to tell me what they observed, just for my own curiousity. Thanks! - J;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Orange sphere with metallic object circling around it.;2004-05-01 21:45:00;120 sec.;Orange sphere with metallic object circling around it. I was smoking a cigarette in the yard of my friends bar. I just got there and hadnt had a drink yet. I didnt know anyone else back there so i just smoked & looked up at the sky. Directly under the moon i spotted an object flying in my direction. The sky was completely clear and i thought it was a plane so i watched. As it came closer i noticed it was dark orange and sphere shaped. I figured that it was a light from the plane. It was at a distance & i had no reason to suspect otherwise. Then all of a sudden the sphere shape stretched out from the right side into a shape i can best describe as an oval. At this point i thought to myself, O.k, it's an orange kite or something. Just as fast as i uttered that phrase in my mind, it returned to sphere shape. As it flew closer i realized that this thing was going much faster than a plane or anything i could concieve it to be. As it was coming closer & passing over me, i could clearly see a metallic shape circling around the sphere at an extremely fast pace, much faster than the sphere itself was moving. I couldnt tell the shape of it, but due to the clear sky & the bright moon, it stood out. The metallic object seemed to be circling the direct center of the sphere. This thing was going so fast i couldnt believe what i was watching. I tapped the guy next to me and said hey, what the #@&%! is that? By the time we both looked up this thing was pretty far already. He replied that it could be a satellite (he hadnt been watching it before hand like myself) but as we watched it, it stopped going in a straight direction and raised in altitude on an upward slant as if headed toward space. The object seemed to disapear. I looked around hoping someone else had been looking up, but the 8 or so people there were engaged in conversations with eachother. The guy who i pointed it out to did not seemed phased & just walked back in the bar. I dialed the operator on my cell phone ( i didnt know what else to do) & asked if anyone else called in a sighting of an ! unidentified object over east Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He laughed,so i hung up. Orange sphere flying at an extremely fast speed, metallic object circling around it at an even faster pace. This, i will never forget. Ive never experienced any thing like this, i know what i saw because it was a perfectly clear night, and i will continue from here on forth to search the internet for another reporting of this sighting. If only to get rid of the how silly am i feeling.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Formation of 6 spheres over Prospect Parc.;2004-10-03 16:00:00;over 1 hour;Formation of 6 spheres over Prospect Parc. while in Prospect Park looking North,we witnessed 6 spheres high in the sky in the middle of the afternoon.At first we though they were planes,there was no sound,no trail & they were not really moving.4 where in a perfect straight line .the bottom one seemed the brightest with 3 directly lined up over it.There was 2 more objects at about 2 o'clock , diagonaly alined with the brightest one.The distance between the objects was constant & they seemed to drift very slowly across the sky. We looked at them for at least 20 minutes while jets passed below on their path to Laguardia airport.We lost sight of them for 10 minutes or so. When we got up to leave,we looked up & saw again 2 spheres,this time directly overhead & much closer.They were still in close formatiom.We could see that each looked as if it was made of 4 oval components.The spheres were hanging in the sky for an other 10 minutes,then just vanished.We left,my daughter stayed behind & called us 5 minutes later,she said they were back,closer than before,she could see a flutter around the bright sphere,she said it looked like a bird flapping it's wings ,or 2 spinning shark fins.They passed over silently & disappeared.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Silver sphere or orb hovering over lower Manhattan Financial District;2006-06-01 00:00:00;Approx. 5 minutes;Silver sphere or orb hovering over lower Manhattan Financial District Approximately June 2006, midday around 1 or 2pm on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, my girlfriend and I were lounging on the roof deck of our apartment building in lower Manhattan’s financial district. I was listening to my iPod while looking up at the sky which was crystal clear blue with no clouds when I noticed a tiny silver round object hovering above. The object was at such a high altitude that it was hard to keep my eye on it. It moved slowly in a south-east direction but would stop and hover completely motionless every so often. I pointed it out to my girlfriend who found it hard to see at first because of the high altitude. She eventually saw it as well. We watched it for a little longer and eventually ignored it as it was hard to track with the naked eye. We are both professionals living and working in Manhattan and really have no reason to fabricate this story.

Ok I usually am very sceptical when it comes to appearances of apparitions, imaginary susperstitions, aliens, ufo's and things of that;2006-06-09 23:46:00;12 Seconds;Ok I usually am very sceptical when it comes to appearances of apparitions, imaginary susperstitions, aliens, ufo's and things of that nature but last night (June 09, 2006) actually creeped me out. A few of my friends and I were walking home from a party about 3 blocks away from my house. We were goofing around and having fun as we walked home. at around 11:40 I looked up at the sky and looked at an object that I had thought was the moon and I thought to myself Hmm... The moon is awfully small tonight and laughed to myself. So we got to the corner of my block and walked down the hill to my house when I looked up again and I noticed the moon was kind of following us. I asked my friend to look up and she said the same exact thing I was thinking Wow the moon looks awfully small doesnt it?. It was emitting this sort of yellowish glow, and was really eluminated. I thought I was going crazy, and it really creeped me out. My other friends then looked up as well and were like what the hell is that thing in the sky? and about 12 seconds after they said that it sped away through the night sky, and as soon as it dissappeared it started to rain. I dont know what that thing was or if it was even the reason for it to start raining but I know it creeped me out, I searched google to see if I could find any sphere shaped objects in the sky and it lead me to UFO'S so I searched UFO's and found this site and thought it was worthy to report my case. This is really uncommon in such an  urban place (or so i thought), I never seen or heard anything like this happening over here, and especially in the Bronx. I thought things like this happened in kentucky or tenessee to backwoods insest-ial cousin families, but when I saw this sphere, this thing move across the sky it creeped me out so much I'm afraid to even set foot outside my door. My mother thinks I've gone crazy and the other friends I was with during this night have gone into denial, with the exception of my one friend who is pretty creeped out as well. I keep looking over my shoulder to see if anything is there, that is how creeped out I am about this. I would leave my information for you guys to contact me but my mother will probably try to admit me into a psychiatric hospital or something along that line. I dont know what you guys do or investigate or whatever but I just thought I'd put in my small report. Thank you for your time I guess and good luck . . .

Small sphere in NYC;2006-09-01 19:00:00;3 minutes;Small sphere in NYC I forgot about this until a few weeks ago when I saw a ufo-best evidence movie. I was walking north on 8th avenue in Manhattan.  It was about 44th st.  I was walking on the west side of the street. I was walking past a Japanese restaurant. I saw two people standing outside, smoking a cigarette (I assume they worked at the restaurant, but didn’t ask), and looking up. What I saw (and this is from memory so it isn’t great) is a dark grey/black ball, about the size of a basketball.  It was hovering over the building across the street.  The building was about 5-6 stories tall, so my guess is that the object was 70-80 feet above the street.  My first thought was that it was a black plastic bag that had been blown up by wind currents up the side of the building.  But I didn’t see any of the loop type handles or an opening. My second thought was that it was a balloon.  I’m still not sure that it wasn’t that, but either a bag or a balloon would normally move in a thrusting jerky type motion, depending on the wind currents.  This didn’t.  At some point after it was hovering, it moved at a slow, but steady pace across/over the street. It took maybe a minute for it to go over say 4-5 lanes of traffic. After that, I lost sight of it as it drifted above the building I was standing in front of. At the time it didn’t seem like a typical UFO because I would think of those as more of a craft. This didn’t seem like a craft at all because of its small size, but its smooth motion didn’t seem like a balloon or bag either. I now carry a small camcorder with me in case I see something again.

small, glowing spheres over new york city, during the day on new year's eve;2006-12-31 14:20:00;15 minutes+;small, glowing spheres over new york city, during the day on new year's eve I was standing on Broadway between 73rd and 74th when an excited, middle-aged woman came up to me asking what was in the sky. I looked up and saw 3 small glowing or metallic spheres. Other people on the street overheard, and looked up as well. One sphere was stationary, one was moving in a steady circle, and the third was moving diagonally across the sky. The woman stated that she had been watching them as she walked up the street for a couple of blocks. She said she had seen 20 or more at once and they were disappearing up into the sky. The three I saw seemed to fade up into the sky as well. A few minutes later 2 more appeared and moved across the sky at a steady rate in tandem, before stopping and remaining stationary. These two were then witnessed by a friend of mine who had been in a store. After the two spheres became stationary, I became uncomfortable and entered the subway station.

White shperical object seen near New York City;2007-05-07 14:01:00;approx 10 seconds;White shperical object seen near New York City It was approximately 2 PM eastern time.  I was out in my backyard and I happened to look up. Relatively far away, I saw a white object. I dismissed it as a plane, but suddenly realized it was circular. It was moving slowly, and crossed the sky a little bit. It appeared to move down but then went upward. Then it disappeared up. I live near LaGuardia Airport, and have for a long time. I can tell the difference between a plane and anything else. At the angle in which the object rose, it was opposite the airports, also including JFK. It rose too sharply to be a plane. I am unsure if the object was a UFO or a balloon. Right after I saw it, I went to my computer. I checked to see where balloons pop. It said they pop at 30,000 feet. http://www.balloonhq.com/faq/howpop.html was my reference website. That seemed too low for where my object was flying. The object also seemed far away, so far that I don’t think I’d be able to it if it was a balloon, due to its sizing.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Saw a Bluish silver colored spherical object stationary high in the sky over the afternoon sky in the eastern Bronx, New York.;2007-05-08 15:45:00;2 minutes;Saw a Bluish silver colored spherical object stationary high in the sky over the afternoon sky in the eastern Bronx, New York. I am a 46 year old male. I work as a a real estate development consultant. I have a masters degree in urban plannning and development. I reside in the Bronx, New York all my life but I travel often. On this afternoon I drove my car to pick up my older brother who was at my mothers house. As I was waiting in front of the building facing a westerly direction I was looking up in the sky before me. It was a beautiful bright sunny day and there were only a few clouds in the sky. As I looked upward I noticed a round object floating high up in the sky. It was far above the the highest planes because where I live Laguardia airport is right over the East River and many planes are taking off and landing. Planes that are just flying through must stay way up there about 30,000 feet. This object must have been as high as 60,000 feet. As I looked at it it appeared as if it had just stopped moving upward. I stared at it. It was light bluish, silverish, whiteish in color. It was two colored in that hew. It seemed to be fading into the background sky. And within a minute it faded away from view. Later that night a friend from the neighborhood told me that he was calling me on the cell phone because he had also spotted it that afternoon. He said it was movuing upward and them stopped. He has seen UFO's twice before.  Go figure. I believe in them myself. It was amazing to see. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Strange lights during storm in staten island;2010-03-13 18:00:00;half hour;Strange lights during storm in staten island I currently live on staten island and have an apartment along the water with a view of brooklyn on my left and the verrazanno bridge front and center and some of the rest of the island on my right. On march 13th the weather was extremely horrible and it seemed as if staten island was in the middle of a hurricane. Heavy objects were being tossed about by the strong winds and it was very dangerous to be traveling as almost all traffic lights were malfunctioning due to the weather. It was about six o'clock in the evening as i started to cook when i heard a great noise out on my balcony.  I walked over and saw my heavy metal and glass furniture being lifted and tossed about like newspaper but i looked over toward my right and saw bright flashes of lights almost like fire over toward a heavily wooded area.  My first thought was a fire must have started over there but the way the bright lights were lighting up only that part of the sky seemed weird to me.  It seemed as if something on the ground over in that direction was projecting a light towards the sky in a cone shape not a natural shape as if it was a fire. Yet the lights kinda flickered like a fire with orange, pink, white and yellow colors.  This lasted for about fifteen minutes. I was stuck in place and suddenly i saw a round object shoot directly up from the spot that the lights were coming from into what seemed like clouds or fog.  At that same moment all the lights sort of sucked into the sky where the object disappeared and then total darkness as if no light were ever over there.  Seconds later a bright blue/green light flashed in the area of the sky where the object and the lights disappeared and the blue/green color lingered for a few seconds and sort of drifted off into the clouds or fog.  I was still standing there trying to understand what i saw or was seeing when about ten minutes later a flash of lightning came pretty close to my apartment and kinda woke me up out of my trance of thinking and made me look up and the same blue/green! color w as now right above me in the sky and in a flash disappeared.  Ive been checking the internet ever since and have yet to find anyone who saw anything from that stormy saturday night.

Star like object and reddish sphere sighting.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2010-06-06 02:00:00;1 hour;Star like object and reddish sphere sighting I went to a nearby park around 1:30am and laid down in the grass, looking up at the sky. I was with a friend. The sky had bouts of moving clouds.  Sometimes the clouds were more dense, and sometimes the sky would be pretty opened up.  I soon noticed a very bright star, there weren't any others noticable in the sky.  It was abnormally bright, and it was moving north in the sky.  It felt much too distant to be a plane, and there was no sound.  I asked my friend what he thought of it. He said he wasn't sure, he thought it was probably a satellite and fell asleep.   I've never seen a satellite before, but this 'star' looking object then stopped and stayed in one place, making small seeming motions back and for or up and down.  This object would fade in and out sometimes, other times it would get covered by clouds and it made it difficult for me to understand what it really was. After observing this one object, and noticing others over a matter of a half hour to 45 minut! es, one single, low flying plane, flew through the sky right in the vicinity that I was watching the object. I felt as though someone else saw this and was investigating the situation.  This was the only airplane I saw in the sky from my location that night.  Not long after that, I saw the most facinating thing I have ever seen.   A reddish, hazy, round sphere, less than a quarter of the moon in size came from nowhere from the lower left side of the star moving to the right, and flew at a very fast speed in front of the clouds across below the star looking object, and immediately moved south, in front of the clouds, but still feeling pretty far away.  The experience lasted about ten seconds and then it disappeared.  My friend soon woke up, and we left. I can't really remember much after the red sphere, I know the sky cleared of clouds, and some stars were visible.  It became more difficult to tell what were stars and if the star like object was sitting among them. I was pretty ove! rwhelmed.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Silver orbs hanging in the eastern sky.;2010-07-24 18:30:00;minutes;Silver orbs hanging in the eastern sky. I was seeing airliners flying by to the east of the Queens Farm Museum's Powwow.  Must be MacArther Airport out there.  Looked up once and noticed three far up and tiny silver balls hanging in a row. Looked away and back.  They were then hanging from top left to bottom right.  Got the camera and located them in view finder.  They were no longer in a formation and only one is shining in the sun but the other two are there.  I thought later that they could be those silver balloons but in a formation? I didn't even stay focused on them because what I was seeing didn't make sense and I was trying to think up a logical explanation.  They then faded. Could've been something floating like balloons on a 105 degree day.  Hmm..... Sorry, I don't have any work right now so I can't accept a collect call.

2 objects flying SUPER FAST speeds in Manhattan;2011-06-14 23:30:00;5-7 minutes;2 objects flying SUPER FAST speeds in Manhattan We were on a roof top bar (20th floor) in Times Square vicinity. The objects appeared to each have 2 lights. The objects were flying in large circles. From the angle we were looking it could look as if they were forming a circle around the building however the objects were way farther in distance. If I pointed my arm up it would look like I was trying to pinch a mosquito. There was also a plane to the right pointing upward.  Compared to how fast the 2 objects were going the plane looked extremely slow.  The objects flew in circles as well as around each other almost as if they were playing tag.   After about 7 minutes they simply disappeared. From the height that we were the sky was more visible than if you would be walking on the street.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Spheres over Brooklyn;2011-07-10 14:00:00;5 minutes;Spheres over Brooklyn I was swimming in my pool and I noticed a white light flashing in the sky.   I live near an airport (JFK), and thought nothing of this at first, thinking it was just a plane reflecting the sun.  But then I noticed that the light didn't move, and I was looking in a direction (North) where planes normally don't come from, and it kept turning into a black sphere.  Then, I noticed 3 more in a straight line, but pretty close together, to the South East of the first object, so that they formed a triangle pointing North West.  Three of the objects flashed kind of slowly, so that it alternated between a white flash and a black sphere.   The one on the South East Corner of the triangle stayed illuminated.  After watching for a few minutes I decided to go get my camera, but when I got back, the objects were gone.   I have no idea what these could have been.  It is a bright, sunny day out, no clouds, and like I said, I've lived near an airport my entire life and have never seen planes do anything like this.

They formed pyramid or triangle like formation each time and where moving against the wind, stopping mid air and appeared to be controlled by intelligent pilots. At least two people captured the event on video.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Reflective Silver/Orange sphere over Brooklyn;2012-10-20 17:30:00;10 seconds;Reflective Silver/Orange sphere over Brooklyn Yesterday at around 5:30 pm I looked up from my laptop and noticed through my east facing window what I initially thought was a plane in the distance(there are planes that fly past my building constantly). This was definitely not a plane and when I really looked I saw that it was a reflective spherical object moving horizontally south to north. I was reflective was glowing orange,but like it was silver and reflecting the sunset to the west.   After I watched it for a few seconds it disappeared- not suddenly, but almost as if it had gone into clouds, like it was fading out.  The only thing was there were no clouds, it was a completely clear sky.  I thought maybe it was a balloon that popped, but it didn't automatically disappear.  It was also close or large enough that I think the deflated balloon falling would have been visible.  This was over buildings in Brooklyn or the Brooklyn/Queens border.  I am not sure how long it was visible out my window, as when I looked! up I only observed it for 7-10 seconds before it vanished.

It looked like a orb and had no lights.

From my direction the light appeared to be southeast in the sky.  It appeared to be moving very slow staying in one spot for ousrs and changing color or morphng within its self.  The light is still there, im observing the object now, its 11:45pm. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius, we suspect.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Orange Orb does a doubletake.;2013-08-21 22:30:00;5 minutes;Orange Orb does a doubletake. I was walking down Stanhope Street and noticed an orange orb in the sky. It appeared out of nowhere, travelled a certain distance(at cloud level it was what would measure 600 yards), and disappeared.  What was strange is that 2 seconds later the event happened again!  The same altitude, the same distance, the same speed, the EXACT SAME START POINT and THE EXACT SAME END POINT.  I've never seen anything in my life that wasn't scientifically explainable.  The orb wasn't even moving fast, but it was steady and streamlined. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Glowing lights above Brooklyn.;2013-10-13 22:55:00;7 minutes;Glowing lights above Brooklyn. I was on my back deck at home which faces south when I noticed a single red/orange oval in the sky, moving east to west thought it was a police helicopter at first.  Then it was followed by a line of similar shaped and colored oval objects.  I would guess about 12-14 total.   Made no noise but there is a fair amount of ambient aviation noise in this area anyway.   Odd sight never saw anything like it in this area at night.  Any ideas?

It was moving in and out of the clouds and it look's like a white sphere glowing very bright and moving and doing manuvers that no plane or helicopter I seen can do.   It just hover back and forward for about 20 minutes before shooting very fast straight up into the sky, don't know what it was.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
2 Orange Orbs flying in low formation over the Hudson River in Manhattan, NYC.;2015-05-07 23:00:00;7 minutes;2 Orange Orbs flying in low formation over the Hudson River in Manhattan, NYC 2 Bright orange orbs flying in tandem/formation over Hudson River near 145 street in Manhattan, NYC [was raised in that area so I’m pretty sure about location].  I pulled out my phone and took 3 pictures while driving on the Henry Hudson Parkway going northbound [hard to do driving 50mph].   Orbs were approx. 90 ~ 100 ft. above Hudson River at a distance from my vehicle of about 2 city blocks when first spotted.  Orbs were traveling southbound @ perhaps 40mph?  Second glance I saw the second orb trailing behind the first [probably 30 ft. distance] and also descending and getting closer to the River.  This time I tried to figure out their sizes but couldn't really determine it so I guessed that the circumference was about the length of my car [15 ft.?] They continued on their southern path at the same speed. I slowed down my vehicle to try to get a 3rd and a better look [some Brokeback mountain guy in his Lego set Toyota was honking his horn behind me until he saw me pointing out my window and at the object.  I saw his jaw drop and his eyes open via my rear view as he saw the orbs]  I ignored the driver behind me and looked to see that both orbs came to a complete stop in unison for about 5 or 6 seconds, then they continued to move southbound at the same speed I mentioned previously.  I lost sight of them as I continued to travel northbound. Both orbs were a steady bright luminescent orange with a slightly yellow tinted center [took a better look when they stopped].  I couldn’t hear any sounds as the orbs flew by due to a commercial plane flying overhead and there was a good amount of cars on both sides cancelling out all other noises.    At first I may have assumed they were military drones but I couldn’t find any reason to that [if military then why orange orbs?] especially when they completely stopped in mid-flight for more than a few seconds and then both continued their flight at the same time.   As I approached the George Washington Bridge I noticed several helicopters flying around and what seemed like 2 military jets circling the area as if they were searching for something.  This was really strange.   The 2 orbs were definitely UFO's [not saying a spaceship carrying aliens from another planet as many people ALWAYS assume that about UFO's]  I couldn’t stop talking about it at work while people are staring at me listening to the story like I’m crazy.  I quickly lessen their skepticism after showing the photos.   I searched Google Images and YouTube and found that these Orange Orbs are a very common sighting especially around the Hudson River from Manhattan all the way up north as far as Albany.  I guess it was my turn to see them...;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
30-40 orbs sighted moving through cloud cover in Queens NY;2016-03-01 17:00:00;45 minutes;30-40 orbs sighted moving through cloud cover in Queens NY I thought I was seeing stars, at firs,t then suddenly realized the objects were moving.  I looked in another area and another one.  The clouds were moving fast and starting to cover quickly though the little openings a light would appear and than be gone moving in its own direction.   At first, I thought I was just the clouds moving against the sky but I started testing each object by using the telephone pole and the wire and I stood still and the objects were moving fast pass my set focus points.   I then ran inside and got my GF and the sky was almost completely covered with clouds. strange cloud fog..  Tiny little holes would open in the sky and you would see one and another and another moving in the same direction.  If that same place was again clear the objects were not in the sky.  Must have seen 30 of these objects before the sky was completely covered with cloud fog.   I retuned outside 45 mins later around 830pm and the sky was completely clear and the stars were ! in there natural place and no clouds to be seen.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Two fast spheres orange in color were moving north by northwest over Brooklyn.;2016-05-20 23:05:00;10 minutes;two fast spheres orange in color were moving north by northwest over Brooklyn at 23:00 hours on May 20th 2016. On 5th avenue and 16th street looking east by southeast there was two orange orbs moving at twice the speed of the usual aircraft in the sky heading north by northwest.  The first one was almost at 23:00 on the hour, the second was a few minutes later at 23:05.   There was also a high altitude jet moving north, a commercial jet moving west towards newark at a lower altitude and a jet coming in from the south moving towards JFK or Laguaria airport.   The two orange spheres did not have lateral blinking lights, they did not make any sounds like helicopters and the color was almost pumpkin as opposed to the usual yellow/white aircraft color.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello again, Mr. Davenport!  The precise date was last Saturday, July 16 2016.  I cannot be too precise about the time ... it was between 10:00PM and 11PM. For certain it was not after 11PM (I was on the balcony with my father during the sighting, then he left to watch the 11 local news).  That Saturday, I helped my sister packing (she's moving to her new house), and I was very tired.  I didn't come home from my sister before 9-9:30PM so the time I went out on the balcony must have been between 10:30PM and 11PM.    I forgot to mention that the spheres were quite big (my father was able to see them, his vision isn't too good).  Bigger than, let's say, the lights attached to the wings of an airplane. Their size, color and movement had caught my eye. Since that evening I searched the net to see if other people have had similar sightings (red spheres).  I found a couple of video clips, with different dates and locations, only in them the spheres were blinking.  I didn't know about this kind of spheres before I am familiar with the UFO  phenomenon, actually, I had had another sighting many years ago, not in the States.  Mr. Davenport, if you want the exact location/position of the sighting, I can give you my home address.  With Google Earth you can access my street, which has at one end the highway wall (the sighting was above the wall, the spheres appeared from behind the wall, then disappeared only to reappear again, a couple of times).  I hope this helps.  Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I was looking further across where the cloud came from and then I saw another cloud coming that was similar to the one we had initially seen.  This cloud, however, seemed to grow in size significantly as it left our view.   At this time, I noticed a small black dot which I had first nearly disregarded as being a bird.  Upon closer inspection of it, I noticed that it had a light that blinked, which then made me think it must be a plane, but I noticed that there were no wings whatsoever, and then I saw the glint of the sun off of the right side of it revealing it as a perfect sphere.   I tried to point it out to my girlfriend, but before I could get her eyes on it it had moved behind a tree out of sight.  I have never reported nor SEEN what I believe to be a UFO and I am a Marine Corps veteran, fully aware of most aircraft that should be flying in the sky.   I hope this report can be useful to anyone else who may have seen what I saw over Brooklyn near Avenue M and Ocean Avenue is my general vantage point of the sighting. The best description of the object I can give is that it appeared dark, as it first appeared to me to be a black dot.  It was metallic in nature because I saw that it had a metallic type reflection, once the sun glinted off of it.  It was perfectly spherical and had a white blinking light that went off periodically with absolutely zero sound accompanying it.  It was not very flashy at all very basic seeming.   The most bizarre thing to me was that I think it may have been generating its own form of cloud cover, as the clouds that were very nearby it seemed to be growing in size in a very unnatural seeming way that I had never witnessed before.  I was unfortunately unable to grab my camera in the timeframe of the sighting due to it only being visible from where I was for a very short period of time, I didn't even have enough time to get my girlfriend's eyes on it before it moved out of sight.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
