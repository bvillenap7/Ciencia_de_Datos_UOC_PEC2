I remeber eating dinner our usual sunday dinner time, about 4ish.  After dinner, i ran back out to hang with my friends for an hour or 2 because i had school the next day and had to be home by 7.  Anyways, i walk up to my friends house and me and about 4 or 5 other kids my age were just hanging out outside.  Finally it was time to walk home. On that walk home by myself, just looking up clear as day a huge bright light, that resembled a mini sun.  It was huge and I didnt see any particular shape or colors other than it was round and the light that emulated from it.  Being that coming down my street at the end of the block was a wooded area (where miggy's now stands) and it was hovering i would say about halfway below and above the treeline, but it was set farther back.  But you could see it above the treeline.   I know i wasnt seeing things because a neighbor, a mom of 2 was about to get into her car, but she saw what i saw and we were just both staring at it like WTF. I never really thought about it again till a few years ago, and i can not actually say what brought the memory up, but i did remember it, and the visual scenario of it sticks with me till this day.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

The observatory was incoerrect, a large round and very bright object was hovering around the Bedford Stuyvesant area at approximately 01:00 or 02:00 A.M. it hovered for aproximately five minutes.

I observed a round black object pass in front of the moon through my telescope.;1994-05-11 22:00:00;10-15 seconds;I observed a round black object pass in front of the moon through my telescope. While viewing the full moon through my Tele Vue Genesis-sdf refractor telescope, I saw a small, perfectly round, black object pass over the lunar disk. The object took approximately 10 to 15 seconds to make the transit. The object was in sharp focus, not fuzzy at all. The moon was also in focus at the time. It appeared as if out of nowhere on the eastern edge of the moon, travelled across the moon's face from east to west, then disappeared into the black sky at the moon's western edge. I looked to see if it was visible with the naked eye after it had passed the moon, but it was not. I do not recall exactly which eyepiece I was using at the time, but I am sure the magnification was somewhere in the 30x to 60x range. I am currently 34, and I have been an amateur astronomer ever since receiving my first telescope at age 7. I am thoroughly familiar with the night sky, and I have perfect vision.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I turned around to look at the incoming flights (possibly to Newark airport), and saw a large round, noiseless object come into view very shortly after one of the arriving flights.I shook my wife , and we both observed the silver disk silently glideing by.The disk proceeded into a cloud and never came out of it while we were looking.Directly behind the disk came another jet liner in a landing pattern.

It was a clear night , I looked up and saw two white colored round objects, bigger than the stars in the night time skies which at first I thought was paper flying in the wind, but it wasn't moving around as if it was paper. I kept looking closer thinking maybe it was some birds flying at night, but it wasn't,at some point I blinked to make sure I was really seeing something there. It was moving slowly ,no noise whatsoever, one was  a little ahead of the first one and then they both began to get closer to each other and began to chase each other around , when I saw this I couldn't believe what i was watching and I was hoping to maybe see someone outside to witness the event , I then ran upstairs to look for my camcorder to try and videotape it but i couldn't find it in time and was not able to capture the lights.

I recorded on a 8mm camcorder, a round/disclike object moving across the face of the moon....twice!!!;1999-08-28 22:00:00;20 seconds;I recorded on a 8mm camcorder, a round/disclike object moving across the face of the moon....twice!!! I had decided I was going to try to video tape the moon thru my Meade ETX90 telescope (which didn't work as well as I hoped). I was looking thru my 8mm camcorder, which is looking thru the scope at 48X magnification (not too much).  The moon was East/SouthEast at the time.  The approximate point in the sky of the moon was Right Angle 0hr15.0m and Declination -3*37 degrees.(I couldn't find the degree character on my keyboard). I then see a round object with no lights or distingquishing marks move across the face of the moon in a straight type of motion. It made no sound, no strange anything at all, just a round/disclike object going across the moon.  I am highly interested in UFOs and such, so I immediately thought it was strange. I was recording, so I have it on tape.  I still wanted to mess around and see what I could get on tape of the moon, so once again I started to look at the moon as I had done just a minute or so before, and I SAW THE SAME THING AGAIN, GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION!  I don't know if it was the same object or a second one, but I did see 2 round dislike objects, at 2 different times, which had no lights or anything, they were just round, black and moving across the face of the moon. I couldnt tell how far away these things were, and I didnt have a chance to see them with the naked eye.  I was recording when I saw them, so I have them both on tape. I will try to send you a vhs copy of this event. I do not claim this to be a spacecraft, or meteor, or satellite, or meteor, or anything else.  I am just a amatuer astronomer who saw something weird.   I have tried to use some deductive reasoning to come to some conclusion.  And my conclusion is that it simply is a UFO.  No doubt about it.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
UFO and Black Choppers over New York;2001-03-18 14:50:00;10 sec;UFO and Black Choppers over New York At about 14:45, I took a break from working in my apartment, which is located on the west side of Manhattan, about 15 blocks north of midtown (my neighborhood is known as Hell's Kitchen).  Outside the weather was brisk, and the skies were blue with scattered clouds.  Looking out my south-facing window at about 14:50, I saw a white, circular-shaped object descend from 70 degrees into cloud cover.  I continued to watch the cloud, hoping the object would appear again.  But that was the last I saw of it.  I don't know what the object was, but it was definitely not a balloon.  Its movement appeared controlled. About an hour later, I heard the low rumble of helicopters flying at low altitude.  Looking out my north-facing window, I saw at least three twin-blade, Sikorsky-type helicopters flying over the city in a westerly direction.  The dark, unmarked helicopters flew over the Hudson River before banking to the north and out of sight. In 8 years of living in Manhattan, I have never seen a UFO or black helicopters.  It was very weird to see both on the same day, within an hour of each sighting.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

When I arrived back in the UK a few days later I uploaded my pictures from my digital camera to my pc. On looking closer at the shot of the Empire state building I noticed a bright object to the top right hand side of the building. At first I thought it could be the moon but then I recalled that it had started to rain and therefore the sky was clouded over. On zooming in on the unknown object I found to my surprise that it was saucer shaped and had a ring of blue lights on one edge. I tried severall different filters to asertain if the object was just rain on the lense but several of the filters showed it was a solid object. This object was not sighted at the time of taking the photograph.  Although judging by the size it must have been visible to others.

I realize that this is Valentines Day, and the object may be passed off as a silver valentine balloon, however it seemed to be very high in the sky. It was travelling left to right with out any movement caused by wind. I noticed it for 10 seconds.  A balloon I would think would be tossed a great deal but this object seemed to be in control of it self.  It looked like a silver circle.  Shortly afterwards, I would say about 30 seconds I saw an aircraft in the sky close to the area with smoke trails and the orb was not to be found.  I had left for 20 seconds to grab my binoculars to get a better look, because my telescope would be too time consuming. I would have to line up the spotter scope first, then look through the lens and i know for a fact that I would lose the orientation of the orb.  Thank you.

Strange White Neon Light UFO Staten Island 7-17-04 @ approx 5:00pm  Annadale;2004-07-17 17:00:00;50 seconds;Strange White Neon Light UFO Staten Island 7-17-04 @ approx 5:00pm  Annadale I have been going to Staten Island to my relatives house for BBQ nearly every weekend for the last 2 months. I have seen 3 sightings on 3 different days, but this is the latest one which happened 2 days ago.  What I saw was a sphere shaped craft hovering over my house at nearly 2500 feet. It did not move at all, and there were 2 times when it was non-visible then reappeared in the same original location. Although it was a nice day out, the craft appeared to be equipt with  the most personalised self luminous white light. This light looked somewhat neon white, or a flourecent white that was obvious to be seen.  My sister was outside with me, and I was pointing over the house but she was not able to see because she was seated under the umbrella for shade from the sun. I said, look at that in the sky.. If you see what I am looking at, you will believe in UFO's but she did not bother to get up.  I did have my camcorder with me, but was hesitant on filming at first because it is very difficult to find small distant objects in the view finder and LCD. Now this is a brand new 3 week old P*n*s*nic digital camcorder, plus I wanted to absorb it mentally, but then changed my mind.  I tried to look at the location of the craft by sight, this way I would not spend too much time looking for it with the camcorder. When I first pointed the camcorder into the sky and hit record I did not realize that the craft was in the bottom left corner of the viewfinder so I tried to zoom in thinking I did not yet find it. Shortly after I gave up when the light was no longer visible.  As I said before, this was the third sighting. This one appeared to be a stationary self luminous neon white light that disappeared and reappeared twice.  The other sightings were black spheres. The other sightings were also with my sister, and I again pointed out to look in the sky over the backyard which she did and saw what she described as birds possibly out of denial.  Just some backround info. I have lived in my relatives house for 20 years, and then moved out to an apartment complex in Brooklyn 13 years ago. It was great to get out from home but I have much difficulty adjusting to confinement in a small apartment with no yard. That is why I am always outside looking up in the sky from time to time enjoying where I spent many of my years as a child.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I noticed there was not a cloud in the sky and said to my daughter did you notice the sky. When she and I looked up we saw what appeared to be stars. We counted a total of 11 objects. One of them was oval shaped and larger than the other ten circular objects. The larger object was light yellow in color as compared to the other 10 which were white like {night stars}. All 11 objects appeared to be hovering very slightly. We both were able to count them at least 3 times. There was also a plane traveling due south while the objects were still in the sky, the objects appeared to be much higher then the plane. We turned away for about a second or two and when we looked up again all 11 objects were gone. We have never seen anything like this nor have we ever had any interest in UFO'S.

Strange light in Brooklyn;2007-05-01 03:00:00;30 sec;Strange light in Brooklyn This is mostly explained by an human controled searchlight. However I will leave this report in case anyone else in Brooklyn or Northern New Jersey saw something similar early may or late april and have been wondering about it. At around 3 am I saw towards the SW at around 30degree above flat ground a very large stationary moon like object. It was not the moon, and much larger. This was through my living room window. I gawked at this sight for a few seconds, moved a few feet left and right to see if the object was a reflection off my window, It did'nt move. I am certain that this object was real and outside my window.  It was the size of a large Grapefruit held a couple of feet away from my face. I turned to get my Binoculars from a closet for 5 second and then when I reentered my living room it was gone--vanished. The most likely explanation was that someone was shining a huge searchlight towards a new building that was located in same direction  1 1/2 blocks away. This flat concrete surface most likely would light up in a circle to resemble this  faux moon. However in examining this sight in daylight I had the impression that the faux moon was higher on the horizon, but perhaps I misjudged this. Also I find it strange that someone would be shining a huge search light which would have needed to cover the surface of old fashion outdoor movie screen at a new building at 3am in the morning. There was no police acitivity like helicopters in the area at the time, nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary. But this is New York and strange human things do occur.

It showed up in sunny sky in Central Park, New York City 05/05/2007;2007-05-05 16:00:00;4 minutes;It showed up in sunny sky in Central Park, New York City 05/05/2007 I saw UFO in Central Park In New York City around 4:00 PM on Sunday 05/05/2007 It was black and it flew like something very lightweight. I saw it around 4-5 minutes and then it lower and lower and disappeared. At that time there was sunny sky, the temperature is around 60 F’ and there was so many people in Park. I think the witness is only one Indian guy and I. However the number of witness could be more because there was very clear sky. I don’t understand why not much people talk about it at that time. I thought it was a toy floating around. After it disappeared from my eye sight, I realized that this is not a toy because it is impossible for the toy to goes that height around 60 floors tall. It is black and it shape like circle. The size is small. I think may be 2-3 kids (5-7 years old) can fit in.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Large, intense stationary bright light seemed to fade in and out over New Jersey.;2007-06-23 17:00:00;45 minutes;Large, intense stationary bright light seemed to fade in and out over New Jersey. While walking along the Hudson River on Manhattan's west side two friends and I witnessed an very large bright white light that just hovered over in the western sky over New Jersey. It was completely stationary and initially looked like a very bright planet shining in the clear blue sky, but soon became extremely intense, then fade away and turn to a barely visible cigar shape, before returning to a bright white light. For about 45 minutes we watched it fade in and out intensely. It seemed enormous in comparison to the planes flying in and out of Newark Airport.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
4:00AM after Thanksgiving in NY - several lights in the sky, one of which was entirely too bright!  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2007-11-23 04:30:00;Over an hour;4:00AM after Thanksgiving in NY - several lights in the sky, one of which was entirely too bright! I woke up at 4:00 AM to get a glass of water when I saw, what I thought was a really bright star out my window.  When I went to lie down, I kept thinking how peculiar it was for the star to be so bright.  I went back to my window and with my glasses and notice that the light looked like it was pulsing.  It would be bright, and then it would not.  So mulling it over I thought, this is really a UFO so I grabbed my camera and zoomed in.  My camera is a Sony Cybershot so picture quality is not as good of professional photographer quality.  When I zoomed into what I thought was a start, I realized I was gazing at a circular ball of light with the colors of fire (red, blue, yellow).  I took note that this light had a pattern which was, after a few minutes, easy to follow.  At the end of the red, blue, and yellow the light expanded.  When I took the picture I would get a disk in the photo, it looks like a disk of energy.  The light would move far away, then it would come back.  I think it had to be several miles away in the sky.  When I started to look around there were 5 others but not as bright, my camera could not even zoom in that far.  I actually when back to bed around 6:30 AM when the light was far away enough that I new it was leaving.  I am 30 yrs old, hispanic, educated with a bachelors in business, I work a full time job, and very credible. This is my 3rd time seeing strange light in the sky, but the first time I got a picture and could verify that it was not just a star. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
VIDEO of orb in Brooklyn, NY 4/26/09;2009-04-26 17:00:00;14 seconds;VIDEO of orb in Brooklyn, NY 4/26/09 On Sunday 4/26/09 at approximately 5pm, I was videotaping the sky over Brooklyn, NY (Windsor Terrace neighborhood) during and after contrail or chemtrail airplane activity. It is critical to note that my curiosity into chemtrails is somewhat irrelevant here and does NOT represent the conclusions of the NUFORC.  Apart from the observed airplane activity, a genuine UFO sighting occurred and was videotaped, and that is the purpose of this report and video submission.  The NUFORC has made it very clear to me that it views the notion of chemtrails as a complete hoax.  I fully accept that view, but am determined to report the UFO sighting anyway. In the wake of the airplane activity (whatever its nature), I shot a 26 second clip of the sky, about 14 seconds of which depict what appears to be an orb-like shiny object.  It becomes visible at about 8 seconds into the video and shines or reflects light to varying degrees until the video ends at 26 seconds. MY BACKGROUND:  WITH UFO'S:  My prior UFO sighting reported on this site occurred on 2/6/97 in Mesa, Arizona.  On that occasion I had a spectacular, close-up, detailed sighting of a triangular craft.  A follow up report gave added detail (map) of the location. OTHER:  I am a former advertising executive turned high school teacher and coach.  I hold degrees in education, marketing and political science. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and found him to be sincere and serious-minded.  We disagreed with him regarding the issue of chemtrails.   We have looked at the video he provided, and we cannot determine what the object is, photographed through thin cloud layer.  However, we have no reason, at this time, to conclude that the object was a genuine UFO.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

What scares me most is that people were walking on Columbus ave at this late night .  But they did not pay any attention to to the sky. The object had no sound. now i'm a true believer.

Bright circular object slowly changing shape covered with small lights over Staten Island, New York City;2010-12-15 06:30:00;35 min;Bright circular object slowly changing shape covered with small lights over Staten Island, New York City I woke up and saw a bright star in the window in north-east direction at 50-60 degrees from horizon. It was 6:30am about dawn, but sky was still dark, and no other stars were visible. Then I noticed that object did not look exactly like star a planet – it had dimensions. It was not a plane – it was not moving, and it was too bright for helicopter. I looked at the object through 24x binocular and found out that I was not able to recognize – a circle with a smaller circle in the middle (like a hole in the middle of parachute) covered with small bright lights (from 20 to 40 lights) that were slowly moving, so the shape of object was instantly and slowly changing. It looked slow fluctuations or as jelly fish moves – I don’t insist that these moves were real – they may be explained by thermal airflows or small moves of binocular in hands. I was not able to identify this object to any known flying object, so I think it was UFO. The only person who witnessed the event was my brother.  Around 6:50 the object stayed at the same spot , but became smaller, it looked like a regular star, though closer to 7am the sky was light, and no stars could be visible. Through binocular I still could see object structure with less details. At 7:05am the object was covered by clouds. Unfortunately I did not have camera or camcorder with high resolution that would allow to show object structure, so I did not make any pictures.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

It was 45 degrees above the horizon, maybe less, it was red and white.  It seemed to pulse.  I waited for it to move. I thought it might be a plane but there were no flashing lights.  It was just red and white.  I compared it to the stars overhead and they were not as bright, but similar in size.   Then as I was watching it, it faded to black, very quickly but it seemed to be a visible fade.  I waited to see if it was a cloud passing over but it did not seem to be a cloud. It did not come back.  I would have thought it was a satellite, but it was not moving and I thought it was too late in the evening to see a satellite that seemed very close.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Brooklyn UFO / VIdeo and Photo / 7.30.12;2012-07-30 16:00:00;~50 minutes;Brooklyn UFO / VIdeo and Photo / 7.30.12 On 7/30/12, from approximately 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM, in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, I experienced a daytime sighting of white orb /circular object / UFO.  With a small digital camera, I recorded photos and video.  Samples of photos and video will, as in previous sightings I have reported, be provided via e-mail/links to NUFORC for review. During the sighting two other witnesses joined me for at least a portion of the time:  (1) another resident of the house (the son of the landlord), and (2) a maintenance person who was returning from an errand to complete a sink repair in my home.  I pointed the object out to them.  We were all perplexed. The object was not stationary, but moved around in the sky for about 50 minutes, varying in brightness, altitude and relative visibility. A local UFO reporting / research group (to which I belong) agreed that the object does not appear to be a balloon or star.  I believe the following could also be ruled out:  airplane, helicopter, standard drone, plastic bag, glider, satellite, bird, toy/kite, blimp. NOTE: At the end of the sighting, chemtrail activity was observed to begin.  It is unclear as to whether this could have been related to the observed incident.  A separate 2009 sighting I reported (which included similar activity) resulted in the NUFORC informing me that chemtrail activity appears not to be a real phenomenon.  Again, as in 2009, it is not my intention to debate the topic of chemtrails, but rather to report the details of the crafts / orbs I observe.  These reports sometimes include airplane activity during or after the event that creates visible contrails or chemtrails.  SAMPLE PHOTOS AND VIDEO LINK WILL BE SENT TO NUFORC. This is my fifth UFO sighting report to NUFORC.  The other four were for sightings that took place on: 1.  2/6/97 (Mesa, AZ)---Original report was updated with map. 2.  4/26/09 (Brooklyn, NY)---Orb 3.  5/14/11 (Brooklyn, NY)---Lights 4.  7/10/11 (Brooklyn, NY)---Brilliant light / orb (NOTE: this is a resubmission of this report.

Red green UFO or drone sighting Brooklyn;2014-02-01 20:00:00;8 seconds;red green UFO or drone sighting Brooklyn I was watching Conan.  To the left of our TV is a window that has a mostly unobstructed view of the sky.  There are no buildings behind our apartment, and the trees are bare, which allowed me to see the sky clearly.  Suddenly a circular red and green light caught my eye.  I believe I either saw a UFO or (more likely) a drone.  It was hovering in the sky.  I got up and went to the window.  I pointed it out to my girlfriend, who was sitting on the couch facing away from the window, but she didn't look fast enough.  Once I got up, I saw the object for only a few moments, and then it flew out of my view.  Again, it was circular, red and green (half red, half green, shaped a lot like that old Simon game), and it moved fluidly.  We live not far from airports, but it was nothing like the usual air traffic (planes or helicopters) we see on a regular basis.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Undiscernable, stationary, objects in the early evening sky.;2014-06-07 19:30:00;30 minutes;undecernable stationary objects in the early evening sky. Yankee Stadium for Joel Osteen meeting.  At about 7:30 PM, I looked up into a clear blue sky and saw what could have been confused as a star.  However it occurred to me that it was too light out and what I was seeing could not be a star, which then got my interest.   Then I noticed another and another, until I counted about 6 objects.  I observed these objects for a few minutes and then asked my family to observe what I saw.   Everyone saw what I saw and some others around us started to look up as well.   Only 1 object moved much but the others were stationary and for all intents and purposes just points in the sky.  One had a definite orange to red color, but the others were a shade of silver.   During the 30 minutes of observation numerous jets crisscrossed the sky, many at extreme altitude, but the points seemed to be higher.   We all speculated as to what these things could be and we considered weather balloons, but felt uncertain as the objects were stationary (other than the one that moved slowly).   In all, I missed about 45 minutes due to this distraction, and turned my attention to the event.  When I checked the sky at dusk, all objects were gone.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

It traveled from an eastern direction and moved toward western direction very slowly then stopped once, continued for a little bit then stopped directly above me.   After the first long pause, I noticed an aircraft (what appeared to be a plane) traveling toward the same direction as the ufo was going.  The plane then veered of adjacent toward the northwestern trajectory.   During  this point I was lying down on the concrete.  The object was shining brightly and stationery at this time.  I then noticed the clouds coming in and it became a lot fainter.  I decided to come inside and report this.   I then called the National UFO Reporting Center.  I went back outside and it was gone.

Looking westward up into the sky I noticed a dark object slowly moving through a northerly direction.  Object was at high altitude so it was hard to make out much detail other than it appearing featureless with no noticeable lights that most aircraft feature.  It was still daylight as sun was setting and minimum clouds were visible.  Object stood out as being the only craft in that section of the sky so it caught my eye.  I managed to view te object long enough to determine it was no plane or helicopter.  Object appeared to change direction from traveling northwest to northeast and seemed to be controlled by some intelligence so it was no balloon.  I eventually lost sight of it as it appeared to disappear over the clouds.  Not too many people were out in the area but I doubt anyone would've been able to see the object because it was really high up there.  My camera phone wouldn't capture it at that distance.  Would not seen this at night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

It looks strange!!    Then as my girlfriend observed it another just like it appeared!!  I said wow look another one!!  She was like, What you think that is??  I told her I don't know but it looks weird!   Then another popped out of nowhere from in the area of the first we saw!!  It was amazing!!   So I started watching the the third one as to see if it was following the the first two and as I watched them they started to kind of disapear!  My back facing where they came from I turned around and observed another coming my way from the same direction! I had to take my phone out to record this!!!   Next thing you know, one after another flying in the same direction started popping up!  I couldn't get a good view of them with my phone so I stopped recording to use a app I had on my phone!  It's like a binoculars app.  I took some pretty good pictures and then proceeded to film again!   At that time a young lady with what I guess was her father asked what was going on.  As they looked up they were amazed as well!  The father suggested I call the cops, as by that time, about fifteen passed us all going in the same direction.   So, I proceeded to walk home, while filming as much as I can.  There wasn't many people in the street, and the few that were around weren't paying us attention.  I know what a helicopter looks like at night and that was not helicopters!!  Nor were they drones!  Over twenty of those things past by Us! I have film and photos!!  Amazing!!!

UFO sightings over NYC (multiple occurrences).;2016-05-21 12:50:00;2 minutes;UFO sightings over NYC (multiple occurrences) Hi, I'm Jason, we spoke on the phone earlier about my many sightings over NYC and I was encouraged to write about one specifically.  I have been using meditative techniques I learned from Dr. Steven Greer's CE5 initiative and applied it to my own practice.  I've been witnessing many orb like UFO sightings during these meditations and have been able to document lots of high strangeness.  There are far too many experiences and incidents to paint the clearest picture of what is happening in just one report, which is why I felt confused about how to report such a long timeline of events.  Despite all these antidotal words, I have documented what I could via my YouTube channel.  It's very basic, no music, no graphics, and all short and to the point.  It's hard to pick out the best video, but I am posting 2 links here, with the first video being the date and time linked to this report.  As I said, my channel is quite simple and you're more than welcomed to see the rest of my videos at your leisure to help understand how frequent it is.  Most sightings, including the one from this report are from my high rise apartment looking out toward midtown Manhattan.  There's telepathy involved in this experience as well as other phenomena that I don't think is productive going into in a format like this. https://youtu.be/rRzSxESV608  https://youtu.be/cRDKX190ZdM;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

It flashed lights approx every 30 seconds which included red & white bright lights in circular motions with bursts.  When not light it had luminous lighting. It never moved!  I first thought a blimp but this was round not oval.  I've never seen anything like it.  At approx 11:30 pm, in front of my eyes, it vanished in a split second.  A blimp would not do that!

UFO appeared over Hudson River and Upper West Side of Manhattan.  ((anonymous report));2019-08-20 03:00:00;40 minutes;UFO appeared over Hudson River and Upper West Side of Manhattan. I live in a high-rise building in Weehawken, New Jersey.  I woke up in the middle of the night and saw this bright object hovering in the sky above the Hudson River roughly across 86th-89th street of the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  As first I thought it was a star, but as I look carefully, I notice the objective was moving and its brightness changes as it moved.   Since I don't have a telescope, I couldn't tell the exact shape of object, but it looks circular and it is bright.  After 15-20 minutes, the object began to ascend and the light got dimmer. Right before it fully disappeared, I saw another similar object appeared above the Manhattan Island, roughly around the 86th-80th street near the Upper West Side.  The object looks very similar to the other one.  It is round and it's bright.  It hovered over the area for about 10-15 minutes, then it traveled toward downtown Manhattan.  It was flying in a straight line, steady altitude, in a speed just faster than a helicopter.  I could hear any noise from where I was.   It continued to fly in the downtown direction until it has gone beyond the view of my window. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I was sitting on my apartment patio in Riverdale section of the Bronx  when two joined red lights appeared. They sometimes flashed.  At times they seemed to merge into one red light. The light/craft sometimes hovered, sometimes flew without sound in and out of my sight.   I called my wife out to see.  We sat and watched it soundlessly zoom, without sound, then stop.  Sometimes a green light flashed as well. The light/craft (I couldn't make out a shape) seemed to be having fun in the skies.  Very fast.  Finally, it quickly descended in a fast, straight drop, our view blocked by nearby trees.   We thought it might be drone, but we don't know if drones are capable of such far-ranging manouvers or coming to an abrupt stop and hovering.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Hovering flashing circular lights in the sky;2019-10-07 06:00:00;~1 hour;Hovering flashing circular lights in the sky I tend to look out my window every morning and notice these lights at a distance. La Guardia Airport is close so there is quite air traffic.  However these lights were first 3 then 5, they managed to just stay hovering.  You would think they were helicopters but no sound what so ever was made. I am not one to believe in strange being but this odd.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I went outside and I saw a few more... at first I could see through them and I was asking myself if they were Chinese lanterns?!  But in my neighborhood this doesn’t happen ...... it looked see through and then solid and it floated on and then the light of the orb would get brighter and I couldn’t see through it anymore ..... after this I saw about three more orbs... in my video I only captured two..: but I was so shocked....;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Black / Metallic objects seen flying NE to SW over Manhattan;2020-08-15 17:00:00;8 minutes;Black / Metallic objects seen flying NE to SW over Manhattan I live in the Harlem area of Manhattan.  My apartment has a roof deck from where I observed two unknown objects.  While exercising there, I spotted the first dark circle moving with a steady velocity from the northeast to southeast.  At first, I thought it was a balloon but quickly ruled this out as the object was perfectly spherical and moving too quickly in a straight line.  It was too high to be a drone.  At one point while directly overhead, it reflected sunlight and I could make out a metallic surface.  My location is near La Guardia airport, but this craft was not observing any common flightpath.  The object eventually faded from view as it proceed southwest.  I observed a second craft approximately 15 minutes later, also dark and spherical, flying a similar path but more westward.  The velocity and elevation appeared similar to the first craft.  Neither craft displayed erratic movements.  There were no lights / signals.  In, fact, what was most strange was the ut! ter lack of any surface markings / characteristics.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Fast moving elliptical UFOs.;2020-08-25 20:33:00;2-3 minutes;Fast moving elliptical UFOs. I was at Sutton Place Park, east 58th street, when I looked up in the sky and observed a phenomenon unlike anything I am familiar with. The UFOs were moving fast in an elongated oval shape and were shaped roughly like Xs. There were approximately 8-12 crafts moving at a fast speed in a cyclic nature. They were light with fuzzy edges.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
11 glowing orange disc flew silently across the sky.

They had no visible way of propulsion and looked like bright circles. We were sitting in living room and looking outside. One of us point out the first orange object, wondering what it was. It had no flashing lights to indicate that it was a plane and had no a single sound. It flew at a medium pace from W to NE. It was at a low altitude. After it flew out of view we noticed that there were two more following it,coming from the same direction it originated from. They glowed orange and looked like a ball but when one of them turned out their glow we noticed it was actually shaped like a disc or saucer. Many more passed going in the same direction, not changing speed and in total we counted about 11. We thought of all possibilities but could not think of any technology that was open/known to man that could move like this. It was low, had NO sound at all and had no beacons to indicate that they needed to be seen by other aircrafts. It’s a Saturday night in Brooklyn so if people are on their roof it should be seen by other civilian! s.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
