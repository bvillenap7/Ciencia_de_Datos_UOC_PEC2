flashing lights zig-zag;2000-05-01 01:00:00;3 seconds;flashing lights zig-zag i saw a flash, then zip to the left, then another flash and zip to the right then a last flash followed by a last zip back to the left, all within six inches square about an arms length away. it seemed to be at aviation height but the sharp angles stumped me. i was alone on my building roottop so i have no witness, but i do not care if you do, or do not believe me. i just want you to know. even stranger was my dream later that night. and like i said i don't care if you dont believe me. i had a dream of being escourted through rooms by a figure. it points to a blank glowing wall and a screen appears showing fiery explosions. it makes me wonder if things imagined come from more than just imagination but also a pre-existent realm of all possibilities. have any of you had a similar dream after a similar siting in the sky. id like to know.

Flashing Object seen over Brooklyn;2001-08-21 00:20:00;2 Minutes;Flashing Object seen over Brooklyn I was in bed at about 12:20 am, and in the North-Northwestern sky i saw an object quite a distance from my house, about the size of a tennis ball. It appeared to be flying at a pretty steady course, then it started flashing lights and moving in a zig zag motion. I witnessed this for about a minute and a half and then it dropped out of sight behind a building;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
bronze sphere, flashed silver, looked like a black horizontal line when flash turned off. moved in straight line across sky.;2003-08-24 01:00:00;10-12 minutes;bronze sphere, flashed silver, looked like a black horizontal line when flash turned off. moved in straight line across sky. I was working on the side of my house, I stoped for a minute to have a smoke and was looking up at the sky at the swarms of dragonflys and locust. this is exactly what i saw: A bronze colored ball, very shinny and it was stattionary in the sky right above my head. I ran into my house to get my bonoculars and when i came outside the object was about a quarter of the way across the sky and moving at a moderate speed and was still at a very hight altitude. when i went back to see it with the binoculars it was flashing silver. it was silver then it stoped flashing for a second or too and flashed from silver to black and repeated until it went out of my view behind houses and a tree. when i looked at it with the binoculars though, It flashed from silver to what looked like a black horizontal line, i guess maybe whats called a cigar or a rod. I kept my eyes on it until i could not see it anymore. the sky was clear and sunny and i can say that i got a very good look at this object.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
SHOOTING FLASHBALL appears from nowhere and disappears.;2006-08-21 01:45:00;split second;SHOOTING FLASHBALL appears from nowhere and disappears. At the time i saw this thing flying in the sky i was talking to my friend. Although i was look at my friend while we were having a conversation i behind him, a quick flash/fireball type of shot out of nowhere. There were some other people around which i immediately made it known that i saw something. However they were all facing my side. I know it wasnt my imagination because as soon as it left, it left this white strip of smoke or cloud for 1 or 2 seconds before even that was gone. My eyes adjusted to the smoke and that was what indicated that i dind't imagine this.  One thing which i found was very weird was that it dind't come from somewhere, it just appread and went somewhere in like 1/10 of a second. I thought maybe it was lightening, or maybe it was some kind of rocket but i never heard anything, and it dind't rain either. It could have been a shooting star, but the object itself was way to big. This was after midnight at around 1:45am and i am sure that eventhough it was very late, there must have been one or two people who witnessed the same thing in Ridgewood Queens, or better to say Glandale queens.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
I was driving home one night at 2:15 am after work with a friend. We were going over the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan and about half;2006-11-20 02:15:00;1 second;I was driving home one night at 2:15 am after work with a friend. We were going over the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan and about half way over the bridge we saw a flash in the sky at about the 2 o'clock position in the sky facing east. The closest thing I can think of describing this is a flash of lightning. It was almost like a flash from a camera comming from the middle of the night sky. There were no clouds in te sky, there was no rain or thunder and was'nt hot enough for heat lightning, being that it was alost Thanksgiving. We both saw this and we were both taken back by this. This did'nt happen again on the drive back to Staten Island that night. We kept looking up in the sky to see if we can see it again. The part of the sky we saw this flash in was not obstucted by apartment buildings or any other structures. This was a clear view off the bridge facing south east. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE)) Hi. My name is ((name deleted)).

Two bright, stationary white flashes over the city during the super moon;2020-02-08 17:30:00;5-10 seconds;Two bright, stationary white flashes over the city during the super moon I was crossing the Whitestone Bridge during the Super Moon coming into the city. I was staring at the moon as it as a cloud passed in front of it. It was beautiful. Off to the side on my left I saw a very large flash of white light in the distance, which I took to be maybe a helicopter, or light of a plane for some reason. I followed to where I thought the light would be next, say beyond the cloud, or further away or closer to us if it was a flying thing. A few seconds later the clouds had left from in front of the moon, and the light flash appeared again, but in the same exact spot.  There was no plane, or building, or cloud, just a flash of white and was very high in the sky or so it appeared from my vantage point.  It was very strange. Strange enough for me to write to this site.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

As I approached the window with phone to capture footage, the object began to move move towards my location facing east. Colors changing from red , white and green. Very bright. I was afraid the object noticed me by the movements it was making as if scanning the location. Then suddenly this object made a move toward the northern sky in a L shaped movement. Once it turned to change the direction it appeared to change into a object with 2 circular objects and the lights changed from a bright spot light to lights similar to an aircraft, as if mimicking an aircraft.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Saw an extremely bright light late in the afternoon traveling at a very high altitude.;2021-06-24 17:45:00;10 minutes;Saw an extremely bright light late in the afternoon traveling at a very high altitude. I was sitting out on my terrace with three other people. My two year old daughter saw a balloon floating upwards. I looked at the balloon and watched it disappear behind our building. I looked up again a moment later to see if we could still see it but instead I saw a glint of an object extremely high up in the atmosphere. The sky was blue and our terrace is shaded in the afternoon so I was able to look straight up and follow the glinting object.  At first I thought it might have been the balloon, but realized it was way too high but also flashing green, and traveling in an unusual pattern high above us. The object seemed to flash on and off as we followed it. It was moving north. I know this because it was moving in an uptown direction.  At times I would lose sight of the object against the blue sky, but then it would flash and I would see it again. The light seemed to stay on as it traveled and I would momentarily lose it and then see it again until it finally just seemed to disappear upward.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
