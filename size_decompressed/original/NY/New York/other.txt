Public School 54's grounds at lunch time. I came out into the school yard for recess, saw with about 50 other students, including some faculty members, a silver pyramid appproximately the size of a small school bus spinning in place about 50 feet above the school yard. The object made no sound. This was no optical illusion because the sun's rays reflected off the pyramid's metallic surface. A few minutes into my observation, a helicopter arrived and immediately flew around the pyramid. The assistant school principal, also witness this event. He remarked something about UFOs, and this was the first time I ever heard the term. The school bell sounded, signaling the end of recess, so I went back in. At the end of the school day I came back out, but both the pyramid and helicoper were gone.  This is my second posting---it is as if either I'm not being believed, or someone wants to censure me. There are no news reports about this incident, but I know there are others out there that witness this event, so please come forward! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Bronx, NY : It was a  solid silver -colored pyramid,  spinning 100 feet above Public School 54's yard;1970-05-01 00:00:00;5 minutes;Bronx, NY : It was a  solid silver -colored pyramid,  spinning 100 feet above Public School 54's yard Bronx, New York. I was a student at Public School 54, an elementary school. At around lunch time I and hundreds of other students and some of the school faculty saw a silver-colored object shaped like a pyramid, about 100 feet up in the air above the school yard, spinning in its place in the same manner as the Earth spins on its axis. I'd say the object was the size of a small school bus. There is no doubt that it was a solid object because the sun's rays reflected off its surface. I was standing next to the assistant principal, who made a comment about UFOs. This was the first time I heard the term ufo. A few minutes into my viewing, a helicopter appeared, which proceeded to fly around the spinning pyramid. Once again this was a solid object that was being investigated by a helicopter. The bell sounded signaling the end of the lunch period. I went back in. By the time school was out the object and the helicopter were gone. The school changed its name to CS 54, and was torned down by the mid 1970s.  I have done extensive web searches for articles/news stories about this event but have come up empty. It is as if I was the only one to watch this phenomenon. But there were at least 50 eyewitnesses! The school's vice principal (middle aged then, now perhaps dead) also witness it, along with other staff members. I would like to provide his last name, if this web site's host will allow it. This needs to be followed up. There can not be an unconfirmed UFO report when there are scores of people who witness it! Other witnesses out there, come forward! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We usually don't allow use of the names of witnesses, although any student at CS54 in 1970 probably would know the name of his/her principal.

Weird collection of lights hovers over Manhattan in April 1989 then glides away;1989-04-19 20:00:00;10 minutes;Weird collection of lights hovers over Manhattan in April 1989 then glides away On the first warm, clear night of that spring - with a full moon - I was walking along Eighth Avenue in the Chelsea district with a friend, as were many other people that night, when I noticed what I thought was a Goodyear blimp in the sky above.  Did not pay any attention to it, but began noticing more and more people stopping and looking at it, nudging their friends, asking questions like What is it?  So we looked again, and then stopped and stared like everyone else. What I had thought was just a blimp was actually a collection of lights or glowing orbs that seemed to be part of one thing - except no body was visible to the object.  It was silent, hovering in the sky just over the street, quite large - like a football field - but without any discernible structure.  It was simply a collection of lights or small glowing orbs.  This was very evident when the thing began slowly moving east, towards the East River, and was silhouetted against the full moon - still, there seemed to be nothing connecting the lights, no body, yet they did appear to be part of a large object. The things then disappeared behind a building on the east side of Manhattan. I will never forget it, and I wonder if anyone ever filed a report because many people saw it.  There was nothing in the paper the next day because the Central park jogger was attacked that night as well, so that was plastered all over the front pages.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I did not see any part of the aircraft.  It blended into the night. what blew me away was the size of this thing.. my opinion I believe this object is man made because the lights look like they came from this earth.  we do have a military base upstate new york and it was coming from that direction south south east.  I do believe that there is life on other planets but I don't think this is it by the way you make a newspaper is the next day small article and that was it ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Each then flying over the trees and stopping whenever they wanted.  I remained fixed on them hoping this was a dream but no so I related everything that happened as I saw it thinking that perhaps one day I could be hypnotized & could relate it all in the order that it happened. It struck me that regardless of size they didn't make any noise.  Any then they way they just seperated & started hoovering & almost like playing over the trees seemed pretty weird to me.  They would start & stop whenever they chose to.  This went on a long time at least 30-45 minutes.  I've always wanted to relate this to someone but have been afraid people would think I was crazy or something. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although that is not indicated by the witness.

Shape changing object;1997-04-25 00:00:00;15-20 minutes;I just finished reading the Woodbridge, New Jersey Shape Changer article in Filers Files #21 and it is almost exactly like my sighting in April or May 1997.  I hope the writer of that report can read my sighting below, from my personal UFO Journal and know he or she is not alone in seeing this type of shape changing object.  Thank you.  Gil Rodriguez  1997 - 16. Spring - April or May. I lived at my present address of 640 East 79th St. between Glenwood & Farrigut Roads. While finishing up a long walk, one morning about 11:30 am, I had the urge to look behind me (a soft (mechanical sounding) voice said LOOK UP) and I saw a large dark (very dark gray to black) doughnut shaped object moving in the sky over my left shoulder. It was over to the North West, a few blocks up around Utica and Foster Avenues when first sighted. I could see the sky through the center of this object. It looked to be 2000 to 5000 feet above the area. After a few seconds it moved over with a fast jump or dart like movement and was almost directly over Glenwood Road where I was walking as it changed shape several times from a doughnut to a cigar shape with the front 1/5 of its length bent back, then it became a straight cigar or cylinder shape, then a chevron shape. It made a jump or move down quickly over the street (maybe 500 feet up) and looked at least as wide as the street (Glenwood Road) I was walking on (it had now changed into a cigar/cylinder shape). After changing again into a chevron, it changed into a figure eight. The exact shapes it changed into, the sequence, I have drawn on paper from that day with a letter I eventually sent to Sightings and Encounters. (I never heard from either show). I somehow had the impression that this thing was alive or that it was some kind of creature, especially when it was cigar shaped with the front 1/5 section bent back. During this time there were about 5 people on the street within the next two to three blocks who were looking at it and pointing. One guy yelled out what the hell is that when it was shaped like a figure eight. I was thinking at this time that if I ran home, I could get my video camera and get some video of it. The object stayed ahead of me as I ran. I ran the remaining six or seven blocks home and went inside calling my wife, mother-in-law and daughter frantically to come outside and see this UFO. I went back outside! and was joined by my daughter, my wife and mother-in-law (there voices can be heard on the tape). I taped for about 54 seconds where you see it changing shape three times before it moved into the clouds. You can see it change into a chevron, a ball or disk and finally a dark/black cigar/cylinder shape before moving into the clouds (my daughter is heard saying  it’s going into the clouds). Today, 1/03/03 I remembered that my first thought was that it was a long string of large black balloons that might have flown off from a parade or a street fair, but the shapes it made especially when it came down over the block (Glenwood Avenue) I was walking on (doughnut, cylinder, chevron and figure eight) made it look like one solid object, with no segments.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
NTSB report of anomalous object near 747 aircraft.;1997-08-07 17:07:00;A few seconds;NTSB report of anomalous object near 747 aircraft. NTSB Identification: NYC97SA193. The docket is stored in the (offline) NTSB Imaging System. Scheduled 14 CFR 129 operation of SWISSAIR TRANSPORT CO. LTD (D.B.A. SWISSAIR) Incident occurred AUG-09-97 at NEW YORK, NY Aircraft: Boeing 747-300, registration: HBIGF Injuries: 3 Uninjured. On August 9, 1997, about 1707 eastern daylight time, the flight crew of a Boeing 747-300, Swiss registration HB-IGF, and operated by Swissair as flight 127, reported an unusual sighting while in cruise flight at 23,000 feet (FL230) over New York, New York. The airplane was not damaged, and there were no injuries to the occupants. Flight 127 which had departed from Philadelphia International Airport, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was conducted under 14 CFR Part 129, and was operated in visual meteorological conditions on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan. Flight 127 was en-route to Boston, Massachusetts when the sighting was made. According to a report from a Safety Board Air Traffic Control investigator: Swiss Air 127 was in contact with the Danbury Sector of the Boston ARTCC at Flight Level 230. Voice communications with Swiss Air 127 were of a routine nature until 2107 UTC, when the flight transmitted, '...sir, I don't know what it was, but it just over flew like a couple of hundred feet above us. I don't know if it was a rocket or whatever, but incredibly fast, opposite direction.' The controller asked, 'In the opposite direction?' Swiss Air 127 replied, 'yes sir, and the time was 2107, it was too fast to be an airplane.' The controller then asked another flight, Eastern 986 if they saw anything like a missile in the area, 'perhaps off your right.' They replied that they would take a good look, but 'didn't think that if it's going that fast they probably won't get a chance. They had just seen Swiss Air go by a little bit ago.'  Swiss Air 127 then reported that they had no warning, & that the object was going way too fast. The controller then asked how far above Swiss Air 127 it was. Swiss Air 127 replied, 'it was right over us, right above, opposite direction, and, and I don't know, 2,3,4 hundred feet above. All that I can tell , 127, is that the three of us saw a light object, it was white, and very fast.'  The flight was then cleared direct to Providence, and told to reduce speed to 300 knots before contacting the next sector. Interviews were conducted with the captain and first officer on August 10, 1997. The flight engineer had not observed the object and was not interviewed. The captain reported: The flight was abeam of John F. Kennedy Airport, Jamaica, New York, at 2106, and proceeding direct to RAALF intersection when the event occurred. The captain was making a public address to the passengers in the cabin when he looked ahead and saw a white object. He saw it for less than a second, and the only movement he could discern was opposite his flight track. He did not observe any wings, and was not sure it was an aircraft. He thought it was cylindrical in shape. He had never been so close to other traffic before. He was not certain whether it was stationary or was moving opposite of the flight. It passed over the cockpit, slightly right of centerline. If it had been any lower, it would have hit the aircraft. As the object passed by, there was no noise, no wake turbulence, and no disruption or anomalies with any of the flight or engine instruments. At the time of the event, the airplane was flying on a heading of 060 degrees, at 340 KIAS, at FL230. It was clear with cumulus nimbus clouds to the west. The sun was behind them. There was no TCAS warning. In addition, there was no exhaust or smoke, no fire, and he could not accurately discern its size. The captain reported his total time as 15,000 + flight hours. He had never seen a missile in flight. The first officer reported: The flight was cruising at FL230. The captain was making a PA to the cabin. The first officer was putting on his headset, and bent over to adjust the volume. As he looked up he saw the object. It passed overhead very quickly. It was close enough that he ducked his head because he thought it would hit them He said it was white and had a round shape. There was no smoke or fire visible from the object. He thought it passed about 100 to 200 feet above the airplane and between the right side of the fuselage and the number 3 engine. There was no drift, and it appeared to be flying exactly opposite of the aircraft. No actual movement was discerned, and no markings were visible. The object appeared to be the size of a thumbnail held at an arms length. The engine indications were steady, and the visibility was unlimited. The sun was behind the airplane. The first officer reported that he had previously encountered a weather balloon over Italy, and the object did not look like the balloon. The first officer reported his total time as 7,500 hours, all civil. He has seen missile shoots from the ground. A check with a Safety Board meteorologist revealed the following: WEATHER BALLOONS * Weather balloons are launched twice a day. * The normal times are 1100 UTC, and 2300 UTC. plus or minus 15 minutes. * The time to reach 23,000 feet is normally about 25 to 28 minutes. Sounding balloons are light tan or brownish in color. * PIBAL (used for wind observations) and Ceiling Balloons are black and red in color. * The closest launch point to the JFK was Upton, New York, about 43 NM east of JFK on a bearing of 085 magnetic. A check of winds aloft data from Upton, New York, revealed the following: Date Time Altitude Velocity Direction Temperature 9 Aug 12Z 500 MB 35 kts 350 degrees -14 C 10 Aug 12Z 500 MB 15 kts 360 degrees -12 C 9 Aug 00Z 400 MB 20 kts 330 degrees -22 C 10 Aug 00Z 400 MB 20 kts 330 degrees -22 C Radar data was supplied by the Boston Air Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), in the NTAP format. The data contained both secondary targets (beacon), and primary targets (non-beacon). The data was plotted and Swissiar Flight 127 was identified. There was no evidence of an opposite direction target, either beacon or non-beacon. Index for Aug 1997 <../9708.htm> | Index of Months <../months.htm>;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
A torroidial (Donut) shaped glowing plasma. The color of which I would closest describe as molten gold, but not exactly.;1998-07-15 14:00:00;20 Minutes;A torroidial (Donut) shaped glowing plasma. The color of which I would closest describe as molten gold, but not exactly. I was at my apartment complex at Starrett City, located in Brooklyn, New York, on my way home to my apartment. The date was approximately summer 1998. The time was approximately 2pm. As I was walking to my building I glanced up at the sky for no particular reason other then to view the sky. That is when I saw the UFO.  What I saw was what looked like A torroidial  (Donut) shaped glowing plasma. The color of which I would closest describe as molten gold, but not exactly. The object was not a continuous torroidial  shape but was instead waning and waxing in the following manner. The object would start out as a vague dim section of a torroidial shaped object and slowly morph into a complete torroidial shaped brightly glowing object. It would then revert from its torroidial shaped glowing golden like brilliance to a vague dim section of a torroidial shaped object, again. It continued doing this continuously during the entire time I witnessed this object. I would estimate this object to be approximately 100 yards in diameter and 1 mile directly away from me. The direction of the object from me was approximately dead east. The object was traveling at a relatively slow but steady southern direction, AGAINST THE DIRECTION OF THE CLOUDS.  I would guess I witnessed the object for a total of 20 minutes. After looking at it for 5 minutes I decided to run up to my apartment to get my binoculars to see it closer. By the time I got the binoculars and made it back downstairs, approximately 10 minutes had passed. The object had traveled so far south by that time that by looking in my binoculars the object looked the same size as when I had first saw it. I witnessed the object through binoculars for an additional 5 minutes and then I simply left off looking at it. I would like to express my feelings as to what I feel I was seeing. Although I can not say for a certainty what this anomalous object was, what I can say, and I feel very strongly about this, is the following. This object gave me a very strong i! mpressio n that there was an engine of sorts powering it and that it was either malfunctioning or was experimental in nature and not functioning within expected parameters. Try and try as They might they could not get this Thing to stabilize at full power. Not unlike a cars engine that simply will not an maintain idle speed. Start it up, runs rough but idles for a while, and then stalls. I want to tell you that when this object was fully aglow as a complete torroidial shaped object its beauty was aw inspiring!!!

I watched until it entered another cloud which, after the craft entered, had a inter-lighning flash. I waited for the plane to emerge but it never did. Appeared to be a plane. Emerged from a cloud after an inter-cloud lighting flash. flew for a short distance in a stragiht line.

Strange Brush fires near Verazanno Bridge;1999-04-01 23:00:00;Approx. 2 hrs;((NUFORC Note:  Although NUFORC does have a few UFO sighting reports that suggest UFO's have started fires on rare occasions, our records indicate no UFO activity in this area on this date.  We note that the date indicated is 01AP98, a.k.a. April Fool's Day.  We hope this report is not intended as a hoax.)) Strange Brush fires near Verazanno Bridge I moved to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn in the Spring of 1997 and have since noticed that brush fires are a common occurence on Staten Island near the old fortress.  I have never associated these fires with anything other than dry brush until April of this year.  As we were returning home my fiancee and I noticed a rather large fire that was in the shape of a near perfect rectangle roughly a quarter of a mile high, with a smaller circular fire off to the right of the rectangle.  Standing on Shore Rd. in Brooklyn you could clearly see the red rotating lights from the fire engines on scene but the location must have been a challenge as there is aparently no access to the area, the land on either side of the bridge is a very steep grade that does not allow any vehicle parking much less a fire engine and there is a great disance between the water and the portion of the hill that was on fire. We agreed with two other people wathcing the fire from Shore Rd. that it was peculiar place and time of year for a spontaneous brush fire and that it must have been intentionally set. But by whom? Unless a passenger on a passing ship was able to throw a huge molotov cocktail a distance of approx. 7500 feet it was difficult to imagine how this could have been accomplished.  My fiancee suggested that it may have been set by a ufo during takeoff. Given all that occurred, that sounded more plausible than any other explanation.  I was not aware of the numerous sighting in that particular area of Brooklyn until I read other reports listed in this database. Perhaps this occurrence was related.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I got very confused and my friend asked me what is wrong.  I said I wasn't sure then looked up towards the South East and saw what looked like a rocket, plane or air craft.  It had a white belly with dark writing on it.  It was on fire and clouds or flames of green and pink smoke surrounded it.  As we watched others waking up and walking dogs also saw this object.  The object continued to streak across the sky until it exploded in what I would say was about seven pieces that started to descend and disappear.   That morning before the attack I was watching channel five and they had reported witnesses seeing a ball of fire all along the North East coast.  He was then handed a piece of paper and reported it as a Russian rocket that entered the atmosphere.  A few hours later I woke to 911. I have been afraid to post this and have not found anything online that is not WTC related.   I hope others saw this and are as curious as I have been.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

The fuzzy, indistinct object seen just to the right of the fireball erupting from Tower 2 (southern tower) is more difficult to ascribe to anything we are familiar with, but our suspicion is that the object(s) may be the engine(s) from UAL Flight 175/Boeing 767 which, because of their mass, penetrated through the building well ahead of the fireball and other parts of the aircraft.

Pyramid UFO;2004-04-06 15:00:00;1 minute;Pyramid UFO At the time, I had a daily habit of going to some local libraries to pick up free books that were being given away. It was when I was walking along Ocean Parkway in the direction of Avenue X from Avenue Z ,heading to the library on Avenue X, that I had my sighting. Off to my left, I noticed a ,seemingly, toy-like object just above the row of houses. Yes, it was that low to the ground. I quickly realized that this was something very unusual. It was a pyramid-shaped metallic object that was rotating as it was ascending into the sky. When I tell people about it, I describe it as being a pyramid-shaped capsule and as being toy-like. I know it was metallic because the sunlight reflected off of it like sunlight would reflect off a shiny piece of metal. It didn't ascend straight up but actually ,maybe, at a 45 degree angle. The rotation or spin seemed to be somewhat slow but at a steady or consistent rate. Maybe less than a minute after first spotting it, it disappeared through the clouds and I could no longer see it. My current thought on it is that it was taking off ,maybe, from someones roof when I was seeing it. I want to point out that this was in broad daylight in the middle of the afternoon and in a main area. It was very busy was alot of traffic and people and there were planes in sky too. There were 2 people that were standing just a couple of feet in front of me ,while I had the sighting. Unfortunately, I didn't say anything to them and I did wish ,afterward, that I had said something. But, there had to be other people who saw it too. I always tell people about it even though the reaction is not good. I made sure that I remembered the date which was on April 06, 2004. I tell people about how  this sighting was traumatizing to me because it ,momentarily, took me out of the reality I was in ,so to speak, and made me aware of another kind of existence. This existence being other-worldly. Being a man of scientific thought, I always try to analyze and understand what I saw. I believe that the object was in some kind of anti-gravity space and it was rotating to provide gravity ,inside of it, for its occupants. But, no matter how much I think about it I can't know how it's doing it. I could only watch in amazement. Just this past year, I came to a startling realization. It is quite possible that these pyramid-shaped objects were commonly seen back thousands of years ago and this could be what inspired the Egyptians and others to build the pyramids. This may be what ancient civilizations did to pay worship to these objects.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Massive UFO over World Trade Center Disaster Area;2004-06-10 04:00:00;30 minutes;Massive UFO over World Trade Center Disaster Area I work in a hospital in Manhattans' upper east side and was called by my nursing supervisor to meet her in the area just outside the hospital as soon as possible.   I joined the supervisor and she asked me to look up and southward into the night sky and tell her what I saw.   Exactly over the area of The World Trade Center Disaster, and fairly high in the sky was a brilliantly lit object that was shaped like a top- the kind kids play with by spinning.  It was pointed on top and became rounded, and than flattening out on the bottom.  We were a good distance away from this and it still appeared huge!   At the very top of this object seemed to be spark-like emanations coming out and around the 'center' there appeared to be revolving alternating red yellow and whitish lights...  The object remained stationary and we watched this for about 30 minutes...   The entire time I had the most uncomfortable and uneasy feeling.... ((NUFORC Note:  We would like to know whether anyone else in NYC may have witnessed the same object.  If so, please submit a report.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Silver object above Manhattan, NYC;2005-09-30 16:00:00;10 mins;Silver object above Manhattan, NYC I work on the 38th floor here in the heart of Manhattan in New York City.   Just right now, I was looking out the window when a silver, metallic, object was slowly moving across the sky.   Its a clear day so it was highly reflective as it moved across the sky.  It was unjulating as it floated.  It was not a ballon b/c it was flying is a straight line and was not affected by the wind.   As I pointed it out to my collegues they too noticed it and were astonished as to what it was.  We followed it as it past high above until it went out of view.  As it flew further out, we all could see its reflective surface.   It's shape was odd.  It looked like a silver tube but was tumbling back and forth but floating in a straight line.  It should be noted that NYC was sprayed w/ lots of chemtrails throughout the day.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Did anyone see a very strange object flying above New York City on October 2, 2005?  I have pictures;2005-10-02 18:00:00;3 minutes;Did anyone see a very strange object flying above New York City on October 2, 2005?  I have pictures On Sunday October 2, 2005, I was standing by the window of my 15th floor apartment in New York, when I saw a ver strange object coming from the east (Queens), flying at relatively low altitude.  I live in a high rise on the East side of Manhattan by the river, and I have unobstructed view of the city, including La Guardia airport nearby and JFK farther in the distance, so I normally see all kinds of aircraft flying around, but this object caught my attention because of its odd appearance.  It was a dark, almost black, very big object that flew very smoothly without making any noise.  Its shape was extremely unusual, very difficult to describe, but it was not aerodynamic at all.  The only thing I can compare it with is a modern sculpture.  It was definitely not an airplane, a helicopter or a blimp.  But it didn't even closely resembled either the image that, at least mentally, we all have of UFOs.  It was not a bright-silver flying saucer, did not emit any lights and did not fly at great speed.  It came very close to my building and then veered north and disappeared in the distance.  I had it in front of my eyes for at least 3 minutes.  It was such as strange sighting that I even thought it might be a hallucination.  Amid my disconcert, I was able to grab my camera and take two pictures which, to my surprise, came out as sharp and crisp as my memory.  I want to point out that it was a beautiful early-fall day, there was still plenty of sunlight, the sky was clear and lots of New Yorkers were outside.  I could see many people walking the promenade along the East river so they all had to have seen this object.  It was impossible to miss it.  And, still, no newspaper or TV news made any mention of it.  I have shown the pictures to all my relatives, friends, co-workers, neighbors, acquaintances, etc. and they all look at them in disbelief.  So far, nobody seems to have a plausible explanation for this phenomenon and even the most skeptic ones (I consider myself one of them) admit it's very strange and suspicious.  I keep these pictures as a treasure but I am willing to share them.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
never imagined it would be this way;2006-07-02 18:30:00;30 seconds;never imagined it would be this way my name is ((name deleted))  y and i live in bayridge on 3rd ave and 71st. today was a day that changed my somewhat skeptical mind to a believer. if i was to hear the story that i am about to tell, i would think i was fu**n crazy!!! Sunday, July 2nd, 2006 around 6:30 - 7:00 pm a storm was coming in, i went to go close my window and i glanced in the sky a few hundred feet over the building across the street and seen what i thought was a hot air balloon and thinking what are they nuts!?!? flying a balloon in Brooklyn? in a storm? then i got a better look as it flowed towards me and realized, holy $h#* what is that?!?!it was triangular in shape, but reminded me of a stingray fish. very aero dynamic, it was porcelain white in color very shiny, had a bright orange glowing border, and a metallic sphere orb attached at the center bottom of the craft. turned on it side slowly hovering back and forth carefully. all of a sudden a bolt of lightning came sideways from a cloud and hit the metallic sphere. in an instant it made a air burst sound, completely turned bright red orange, then gone. at first i thought it exploded so i kinda jumped back. but it just like magic, disappeared. i freaked out because i always imagined if i did see one, it would be at night, all the way up in the sky flying around with lights. never would i have expected it to be this way. i mean broad daylight, just above the buildings. and i seen it if it were the size of a baseball! right in front of my eyes! everyone should have seen it, it was very large and right there!! i can't sleep. i can't stop thinking about it. i can't stop going to the window out of curiosity. i was afraid to tell anyone for the reason of people thinking im on drugs, or am just crazy! that's what i would have thought! thank god my girlfriend heard the sound. later on around 10:00 pm i went to the store, i look up in the same area, and see a white orb floating very slow and straight towards the gowanas. i said this can't be! i shook my head and convinced myself it was a bird or something. then i look again and see a black orb leading 2 more white orbs in a triangle formation and said i must be going crazy!. i walk fast toward the pizza store and the guy asked you ok? i said no but if told you i would just be a nut so forget it. the guy said i tell you something people think im crazy that last week i saw a ufo in bensonhurst. i almost had a break down and got this feeling of being in like the twilight zone or dreaming. this cant be happening i said. i told him that is exactly why i am freaking out. so he tells me to tell his friends at work the story i just explained and they all look real scared. they say word for word it was the same story except for the lightning  hitting it. and for a week they were all abusing him about it. so we basically felt a huge sigh of relief. says that his brother seen it as well but did not hear the noise he heard which was strange and could tell that confused him the most. so i go home bugging out and just see and search google not expecting anything to come up, but to my surprise i was not the only one. very similar stories and descriptions all over. my gut tells me it is dimensional. like beings from other dimensions or something. i mean the way it just flashed gone!! like a light switch. the craft honestly was beautiful! perfect! floated like a balloon. like it weighed nothing. i think it was searching for the lightning to give it that charge boost or refueling. it was just moving in a way that it seemed to like get the right spot. like fine tuning a radio station. or harpooning a fish. what i saw was surreal. i mean right there!! in front of me and my eyes! in real time! wow i can't stop picturing it! it all happened in like not even 1 minute which seemed like 10 min. i was speechless and in shock at the moment. lost for words. and was shaking like a leaf. never would i think i would be one of those people who had a story like this to tell. now i am one of the so called crazy ones. all i have is my sketch of the craft and in my view is a very good one. i know i will always be lookin in the sky from now on. its not the question anymore if they really exist, but what does earth, or the 3rd dimension do they seek or need.  and is the goverment involved? because now i do reserch and see that there are hundreds of sightings per year!! and we deny them. are they here to help, or destroy? too many questions i now have and definitly wont be sleeping tonight! wow is all i keep saying. for the records i got this impression, or feeling that they or it knew i saw this. for what ever reason. hands down the most shocking thing i ever seen. this exp. made me a skywatcher.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Helicopter-like ship light belt;2009-01-13 04:20:00;15 minutes;Helicopter-like ship light belt I live in Manhattan , New York city, and would like to report the strange thing that happened tonight at about 4AM . I was watching a movie, when a strong noise, like that of a helicopter, appeared all of a sudden over my building (very close to Washington Square)  I went out to the balcony and saw a big object standing still, flying very close to the last floor (the 17th, I live in the 3rd)  Actualy I would have said it was a helicopter, but my mind was saying to me no, it isn't, as there was a wierd light belt surrounding the structure from the bottom to the top, with white, blue and red colors.  I went downstairs to follow the object, as it was disappearing to my eyes whenever it crossed to the other side of the building or was geting closer to the roof.  As you can imagine, I wouldn't have gone downstairs a regular monday at 4AM for something that wasn't wierd enough.  I have to add also that, as a sciencetist I use to be kind of objective and sceptic.  I took my camera (regular old digital camera) with me, but the only one picture I could make was a very vague light in a dark sky, which equals nothing.  The object finally slowly flew towards the west side, I tried to follow it, but disapeared between the buildings. I went from 3rd street/Laguardia Place  all the way to the 7th avenue, and from there I could just slightly hear the helicopter noise, but couldn't see anything else. I want to imagine that it was a helicopter that, because was dark and the long shaped structure, I was confusing with something else, and that's all. But could you please let me know if you have been reported from anyone else or you can find anything like this today?

UFO near JFK Airport NY on a bright sunny day;2009-10-04 15:30:00;6 minuts;UFO near JFK Airport NY on a bright sunny day My father called me onto the front porch and pointed out something in the air in the vicinity of JFK Airport.  It was a ball on top with a poll going down attached to another ball at the bottom.  I said “Balloon”.  My father said it was too big.  I thought it was odd how it was flying  - Not moving – If they were balloons on a string there would be some movement but it was moving like it was all one piece.  Also it was only straight up and down with one ball on the top and the other on the bottom.  I ran and got binoculars.  It was hard to hold the binoculars steady enough but I saw faint pink, yellow and then white lights on the balls. The poll between the balls was to thick to be a string. I put the binoculars down to look at it with my eyes and it flashed (Like a camera flash) and it was gone.  It was a bright sunny day with blue skies and some puffy clouds.  My father did not see the flash because he was not looking at the time.  He estimated the size as! about half that of an airplane.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
An unidentified, misshapen flying object east of Manhattan, moving eastward over Long Island, at a constant rate at a constant altitude;2010-06-01 19:05:00;5 minutes;An unidentified, misshapen flying object east of Manhattan, moving eastward over Long Island, at a constant rate at a constant altitude Although it is fleet week in NYC, I am convinced this is no military aircraft.   I was suddenly urged to look out the window which I have a limited view of the sky out of anyway.  Immediately I saw this object moving across the sky, at a fairly decent height above, moving at a normal aircraft speed, but back and forth motion, not in a straight path.  It was an unidentifiable, unclear shape, unlike anything I would ever expect.  It was unsymmetrical and there were no lights present on it.   I recorded it for a couple of minutes and it then moved beyond the horizon of the buildings and out of view.  I posted the video on a site for friends to view and all were unsure and somewhat uneasy or even convinced.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

formation of lights seen overhead;2011-03-01 17:15:00;perhaps 5 minutes;formation of lights seen overhead At 7:15 pm last night, I walked out of my office building at 55th Street and Broadway in Manhattan.  I’m an amateur astronomer and I often look up at the sky, and I did so as I left my building. Almost directly overhead I saw perhaps 6 to 8 hazy and indistinct lights— that’s the only way I can describe them. The lights were in a roughly cruciform shape, but just roughly.  The lights at the “ends” of the longer axis would brighten occasionally, then dim again, but in all instances the two end lights were brighter than the other lights of the shape. The color of the lights was a grayish white, never varying. The shape was, as I say, almost directly at my zenith, somewhat to the west of an imaginary line drawn between Castor and Pollux at the north end and Betelgeuse at the south. I was confused, because I knew the sky was supposed to be clear lasnight (I’d just checked it on the New York Clear Sky Chart, http://cleardarksky.com//c/NYCNYkey.html, as I often do). And indeed I saw numerous stars in the sky, including just around the light formation, so the sky did seem to be clear. I looked away, to see if anyone was near to verify what I was seeing, but (surprisingly) no one was. When I looked back, the lights were still there. When I looked away again perhaps 30 seconds later, then back, they had disappeared entirely. A few minutes later I noticed two of the lights once more, for perhaps 30 seconds, then they again faded they had seemed to move slightly to the west in the time since my initial observation. The only thing I can think that could cause this display would be a set of narrow-beamed lights pointing straight up and reflecting off a cloud layer I could not see. However, if there were any clouds there, they did not cover any of the stars in my field of view. I have to say, though, that it did not feel like lights reflecting off clouds, to my eyes. It looked more like bright lights shining through a cloud, but as stated there was no cloud layer visible. The only logical explanation is lights reflecting off clouds that I could not see, but I don’t think that’s what it was. Even so, I probably would not have submitted this sighting but for something odd that happened a few years ago and that this event reminded me of. At that time, perhaps five years ago, I was behind my apartment building and I had again looked up as I recall it was late evening twilight. I saw, again overhead, four bright lights in a square or diamond formation. These were pinpoint sources, and looked like bright stars. As I watched, over the course of perhaps a minute, the lights faded, in unison, and disappeared. I know this may make me sound odd, as if I have a habit of seeing things.  I do not. As an armchair astronomer, I take an active interest in the sky and tend to look at it often.  Thus I’m not surprised that I should have seen these things, which probably have prosaic explanations, but which for the life of me I can’t figure out. I’m a rationalist, a skeptic, and I have to admit I can’t explain these events.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Two aircraft wider than jumbo jets, no lights, flying North to South, in the vicinity of LaGuardia Airport.;2011-12-18 23:40:00;about 10 minutes;Two aircraft wider than jumbo jets, no lights, flying North to South, in the vicinity of LaGuardia Airport. UFOs over Queens!  I want to type this out while it's still fresh in my mind.  I am not joking here, at the same time I don't think it's ET. I was just taking the garbage out, at 11:40pm and looked up at the sky like I always do to see the position of the planets and such--because I'm an amateur Astronomer. And there I saw two identical, ribbon like objects appearing to be light in color, each wider than a jumbo jet, no lights, gliding North to South. If I had to compare them to known aircraft, I would say they were like giant flying wings, or super wide wing span gliders--but they almost appeared to fly and look more like parasails.  They weren't point towards the front at all like a chevron, just one super wide strip of aircraft, more like parenthesis shaped. When they were nearly overhead they were easy to see, and as they passed they became more and more difficult to see due to the NYC haze. Basically, they flew between my location on 35th Street in Astoria and LaGuardia Airport. I listened for engine noise and thought I could hear jets, but I'm near LaGuardia so of course I hear jets all the time.  It would be more remarkable if I didn't hear the faint sound of jet engines. No other aircraft in the sky that I could see from my position, certainly none displaying their lights. I could not tell how high they were flying due to the fact that they were unrecognizable aircraft with no lights, but they were not at high altitude. If I had to guess, I would say they were just high enough to clear the Manhattan skyline if they wanted to. One of them moved straight across North to South, while the one next to it appeared to bank towards the Southeast for a moment before returning to it's position along side the accompanying craft. They were not moving fast or sporadically.  They were obviously being piloted. Very rarely I see military planes flying in twos along this route, but these were not airplanes of any design I've ever seen--even given my overall love for the sky. 15 minutes ago. I'd say it took about five to eight minutes for them to move across my piece of sky. I would have run in to get my camera and take a picture or video, but it was very dark and the objects would be gone before I had a chance to take the video.

Approx a week ago, after midnight, my husband was woken up by a tapping sound on his bedroom window but did not pay any attention and continued to sleep.  He woke up the next morning and did not forget that ackward tapping on the window.  At night he'd see through his peripheral vision things that flashed by but would not relate to as being important.  At 3:00AM the tapping and the scratching on the window awoke him, he had his smartphone under the pillow and slowly focused and snap the picture of what appeared to be a metal looking alien with 6-8 metal antennas.  As he snapped the picture before he ran out of the bedroom he noticed that it was backing away. My husband never returned to that bedroom instead he went to the bathroom and observe the picture that he had taken.  He became very nervous and did not go back to sleep.   We have a very clear picture and I've called and spoken to Mr. Davenport Director of UFO Center and will send the email with the linked picture taken ~ 2 feet away from the window.  He is extremely concerned for his safety.  I'm requesting a returned email @ ((e-address deleted)) at someone's earliest convenience.  Thanking you in advance for your attention to this matter.

Strange fast moving orange  lights in the sky that did not function like airplanes.;2013-06-22 21:33:00;1 minute;Strange fast moving orange  lights in the sky that did not function like airplanes. The first time I went out  into the backyard was to do a chore for my mother.  Then I saw a light high in the sky appear out of nowhere.  And right afterwards, like 2 seconds, another one appeared.  And then I called my Mom and my brother and told them to get their phones and then another one appeared. We didn’t get our phones in time and then as they went into the distance, they vanished – disappeared.  But they flickered out before completely disappearing. A little while later, from the opposite direction from where the other ones came from, a smaller white one fly over and I didn’t see it vanish but it flew past where we could see (buildings got in the way). The first three were a bright orange, They were circular with a big circle of light on the inside.  The smaller circle in the middle gave off the most light.  (My Mom describes them as bright arcs with a very bright middle circular light in the middle.)  After the first 4 passed, we all went inside thinking no more would come.  But then my Mom reminded me to finish the chore I went out there for, I went and saw that two more appeared out of nowhere as they did before. So, I ran inside and got my phone and took a video of what I saw. This happened around 9:33pm on Saturday, June 23rd, 2013.  Oh, and our upstairs neighbor saw the same lights while coming home from the store earlier than we did.  Then he caught the tail end of what we saw when he went into his apartment upstairs.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

It resembled a bright white cloud moving opposite direction of the other clouds.   When I pulled out binoculars I observed 4 orbs rotating around the cloud as it moved across the sky.

The crafts had no visible lights or propulsion system or condensation trials.  These crafts were flying together and appeared to be flipping, they were flying too high and too far to be drones.  The crafts continued to fly together, almost playfully and flew into the distance out of sight where they diverged, one craft flew North and the other North West over Manhattan.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Mother and daughter see a &quotflock&quot of flashing blue lights traveling over Brooklyn;2020-09-19 16:15:00;5 minutes;Mother and daughter see a &quotflock&quot of flashing blue lights traveling over Brooklyn My daughter and I were on our patio at 4:00pm in the evening.  The sun was still bright.  We heard an airplane and looked up (we are in a flight path).  After the plane passed we saw MANY, hundreds at least, flashing blue lights moving as a flock over our apartment building.  They seemed to have something like a cable dangling from some of them and that cable sometimes had a flash of it's own.  We were mesmerized.  I told my daughter to run and get my phone inside.  She did but the flock was moving fast.  The sky was bright and cloudless and I took video but it didn't come out very compelling.  They had moved too far away and it was too bright.  I searched online and couldn't find anyone mentioning this.  I found a video on CBS news (local) website that had a UFO sighing from fall of 2010 that looked very similar.  I don't believe in alien abductions etc.  I'm pretty conservative.  This was just so bizarre I had to have it! noted somewhere.  I just would like someone to tell me what it was.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
