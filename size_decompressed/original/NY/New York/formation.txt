Pool Rack formation seen over an Army Base in Brooklyn, NY during a meteor shower;1992-11-18 19:00:00;5 minutes;Pool Rack formation seen over an Army Base in Brooklyn, NY during a meteor shower Some time in the early 1990's, probably around '90 or 91, there was a heavy meteor shower clearly visible over the NYC area. I was located inisde the Fort Hamilton Army Base in Brooklyn, NY. We observed the shower, just over the horizon, through the center and upper level of the Verrazzano Bridge. It was an amazing sight. But when we looked directly overhead, we saw about twelve unknown craft, all bottom-lit and flying in what I could only describe as a group of pool balls in a triangle formation, moving at a high rate of speed.  These craft were definitely over the ceiling and were moving much faster than a passnger jet would fly at the same altitude. The most amazing thing about this sighting was that the UFO's switched positions rapidly, in like an X fashion, just as they were flying over my head. all of them did it at the same time, quite rapidly and precisely - it was then that I knew that the only group capable of doing such aerial arobics at that speed would be the Blue Angels.  But why would they be flying over the city on an average day and at night - and in such a formation? And why were the fighters bottom-lit? Alot about this encounter did not make any sense to me. My natural assumption is that the craft must have been extra-terrestrial. I'm just hoping that I wasn't the only one, aside my cousin, who had my eye on the sky that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date, allowing for the possibility that the witnesses may have been looking at the Leonid (??) Meteor shower, which we believe is the shower that occurs annually in mid-November.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
One light emits multiple identical lights above Manhattan;1998-01-15 01:00:00;10 seconds;One light emits multiple identical lights above Manhattan I saw a light crossing the night sky that split into two, then three, then four, and maybe more, separate lights. All of the lights continued moving in the same direction as the original light none appeared to fall, which I assume they would have had they been flares dropped from the original light (well, airplane, in that instance). Also, each of the lights--the original, as well as those that came out of it--were identical in apparent size--they were point sources--as well as color, luminosity, etc. They were identical, so far as I could tell.  The original object was traveling much too slowly to have been a meteor or other bolide breaking up in the atmosphere--or so I would judge. I distinctly remember that I had the impression that it was not a natural object of that sort, but rather an object--objects--under intelligent control.  I wish I had written down precisely what happened right after I saw it, because the details are now a little fuzzy. For instance, I cannot recall now if all of the subsequent lights merged out of the original light, or if each new light then split into another one it may well have been the latter. In any case I remember being very perplexed by it. It was certainly out of the ordinary. I am an amateur astronomer, and this was something I had never seen before. I don't know what it was--I'm not prepared to say it was an alien spacecraft or anthing of the sort--but it was definitely something I could not identify.  I am a skeptic, but I'll admit I'm interested in the topic of UFOs. One point that may interest some: one often hears from (other) skeptics and debunkers that astronomers--i.e., people accustomed to observing the night sky and familiar with its various phenomena, from eclipses to apparitions of the planets to meteors, etc.--never report seeing unusual objects in the sky. Well, I just did. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Unidetified cluster of objects moving over Manahattan;2000-09-16 15:30:00;10minutes;Unidetified cluster of objects moving over Manahattan We saw a cluster of white dots that looked like a constellation of stars that appeared to be very high in the southeastern sky which moved as a cluster in a southeasterly direction over Manahattan.  It was 3:30pm on a very bright, sunny day, and the objects were very distinct and remained visible for at least 10 minutes as they moved as a group and got fainter as they moved away.  If had been night, these objects would have looked like a constellation, but they were definitely not stars!;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Staten Island ( UFO? ) Formation on 05/12/01;2001-05-12 22:00:00;3 minutes;Staten Island ( UFO? ) Formation on 05/12/01 Ok, now this just happened 2 hours ago here in Staten Island and it has me very worried. I was outside with my friend ((name deleted)), skygazing like I have done for years, I am an avid astronomy buff. I know all of the things that should be in the sky, why and all of that. Tonight I saw something in the sky that I cannot explain, and when I think of all the possible things it could have been, the closest thing I can envision is a formation of Air Force jets. We were skygazing all over the sky, but when I first saw the formation, it was in the south/ south east.   It slowly moved from the S/SE to the North then vanished out of sight.  I quickly asked my friend if he saw it as well, and he looked and said what the hell is that ((name deleted))?  I said I have no idea, standing there with my eyes wide. My first reaction was that it was a seagull being lit up by the street lights and we could see the belly of it. But then i realized it was not, due to the fact that this was WAY too high to be any bird. Or was it? I quickly took the binoculars we were using to tour the city sky and focused on the formation. to my surprise, it looked the same as it did with my naked eye. These were 10X50 binocs, and I cannot explain why i did not see any more detail. Now this is where it gets tricky, because it was either a very large object, or perhaps dozens of small objects flying in formation. they were all a solid red color, but *very* faint. My friend thought they changed color to a dull orange, but I could not see that. They did not blink, it was just a steady, *very* dull red of basically dots moving across the sky VERY high up. Have you ever seen a sattelite from earth when it passes overhead? Well, it looked like that, a steady light, but not white, red, and much duller than a sattelite. I only wish I had my telescope out. I was SO mad later on for not bringing it out. When we could not see them anymore, my friend wanted to go do something else, but I said wait- listen. Do you hear anything? He said no. I heard nothing the ENTIRE time, and I know what a plane sounds like even that high up. It was dead quiet, no sounds after they passed over head, nothing. It was very errie in fact. I in my 10 years of being an amature astronomer, have never seen anything like this in the sky, and nothing I know of in space can produce this, and nothing I know of in terms of aircraft can produce this to my knowledge.  And I know alot about space and the sky. The weather was crystal clear, with great seeing and no humidity. A cold front passed by about 2 hours before the event, and when I thought about it I wondered if I saw my first ' ball lightning' but the stories I have heard about ball lightning none of them say it can last this long, nor be this high. I do not know what else to say. I never expected to post to this website, I only started to come here to read the reports people post and try to think what they could have been in the 'real world' , like a certian star out that night or something. etc. I wish I could find out what it was in the sky, it confused me. It scared me frankly, cause nothing I have ever learned prepared me for this. This is the first time I saw something in the sky that I could not explain right away since I was a child, and learning in school. Well, here is the report, as quickly as I can write it. Sorry for the typos, I am so tired. :)  Oh wait I just remembered, as always, there was tons of air traffic in the NYC metro area, planes going to kennedy, newark, etc. I am used to their patterns and they were flying the same patterns when this was going on to my knowledge. But I was looking at the formation the most. :);40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Formation of moving lights over Manhattan;2002-12-01 17:15:00;1 minute;Formation of moving lights over Manhattan Don't know if this was a UFO, but here it is: Over Manhattan: I saw a group of lights. If it was daylight and they were not illuminated I would guess it was a flock of geese. It appeared like a typical formation of birds, but the shape changed as it moved across the sky. At times it looked more like a string of illuminated pearls. Maybe it was just geese catching the lights from Manhattan. I'd never seen anything like it before. I watched it for about a minute. Then it was just gone. Any guesses as to what I might have seen?;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Formation of moving lights over Manhattan;2003-07-17 21:19:00;2 1/2 minutes;Formation of moving lights over Manhattan A friend and I saw a strange black object rise over the west side of Manhattan.  The object proceeded to float eastward over the east river - a description that someone used earlier this year is perfect - a string of illuminated pearls trailing this black balloon-esque object.  The strings were stationary, i.e. not moving around - just trailing the object.  It looked like a moving constellation.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Shape-changing formations above New York City during lunar eclipse;2003-11-08 20:00:00;Approx. 1 hour;Shape-changing formations above New York City during lunar eclipse Over the course of an hour or so, some time around 8PM, I saw something in the sky above Manhattan that at first looked like a group of birds flying in a V formation. They were very high up and moving North to South. The formation was shifting and changing in strange patterns, however, and after a few seconds it became clear that they were not birds- the shape appeared to be too high and was moving too quickly. They looked almost like long strands of toilet paper, really high up, that would separate and then re-connect.  We saw several of these formations fly across the sky, all North to South (the opposite direction of the wind). Some appeared to be illuminated, although it's hard to tell if they were producing light or reflecting the light from the city below. There were no flashing lights.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Right half of arrow.;2003-11-08 20:16:00;2 sec;Right half of arrow. Location is approximately 20 miles north of midtown Manhattan, NYC.  Lights of unvarying medium magnitude, moving silently on course 170-190, toward NYC. Lights observed on school field while observing lunar eclipse.  Formation description:  if an observer were to be perhaps 1,000 feet above a darkened baseball diamond, players at the following positions would be seen with flashluights shining overhead: homeplate pitcher's mound third base midway between home and third base second base shallow center field  The formation thus resembled half of an arrow.  From front to rear of formation: approximately 5 degrees of arc.  I saw it to the right of the moon, just south of zenith amd could see it for approximately 2 seconds.  In this time it covered approximately 30 degrees of arc, moving with the light in the homeplate position in the van.  Indeterminate shape seen moving silently at same location approximately 3-5 minutes later. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the date of the alleged sighting was in the year 2003.  We have altered the date above to 2003.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Cluster of UFO's with a big silver craft in the middle;2006-03-01 15:00:00;15 minutes;Cluster of UFO's with a big silver craft in the middle We were at the Gateway Mall parking lot, just came out of Target.   Walked to the car and saw them because the sun was reflecting off of the big silver one in the center. Kennedy airport is nearby cause the Mall is right off the Belt PKWY.  We looked at the big silver one and saw about 20-30 little ones circling it.  Making formations and moving into each other and toward the big silver one and more came out.  Some were stationary.  They moved slowly and then moved fast.  They would drift In any direction.  We knew it was not ballons.  We tried to convince ourselves that it was snow stuck up there with a big silver blimp in the center because we didn't want to believe we were seeing what we did. We tried to get other people to witness it but they were in a rush to get home since a snow storm is heading here slated to hit tomorrow morning.  My friend thought she was looking at a constellation until she noted that you cannot see stars in broad daylight and they are not accompanied by a big silver ball.   We stood there for awhile and we saw planes flying in the other direction away from it.  Helicopters showed up about 10 minutes later, they were black and it looked like they were chasing it but they backed off and flew away from the silver one.  We drove off and tried not to see anymore.  It left us quite nervous and excited.  But more nervous than anything else.   I wish I had had a camera, video or film butI didn't.  I plan to carry one from now on.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Formation of lights moving at a plane like pace-dimmer ones leading brighter ones;2006-07-31 01:00:00;1+hours;Formation of lights moving at a plane like pace-dimmer ones leading brighter ones We were sitting on the beach..I wanted a midnight swim after a very late dinner..while I has floating I noticed a shooting star. I got out of the water and sat with my husband, we both started looking at the sky, and were amazed to see a small dim light moving in front of a larger greenish white light. Still looking we noticed that the were zigzagging a moment or two and the going forward. And also there were several more similar lights in a row. When the first set passed there was more to follow. My husband is a retired professor (university), and I am a housewife, we do not do drugs, and are convinced that these in no way could be stars, nor planes. There were also a few others on the beach looking into the sky..but hey, its New York..who wants to ask anyone if they saw a ufo!;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

They never changed altitude but seemed to stay the same size.  their altitude was above the planes that approached.  Im sure the pilots must have seen them.  hey reflected and may have produced light which was white-yellow! with a hint of orange.

V-Shaped formation of silver orbs flying over NYC;2020-11-18 14:45:00;5 minutes;V-Shaped formation of silver orbs flying over NYC Around 3:45pm on November 18th, 2020 My husband and I witnessed what appeared to be several UFOs.  We were in Harlem, NYC. I noticed a commercial airline flying overhead, so looked up, and much further up in the sky, past the airplane appeared approximately 7-9 bright lights (or silver objects, as it was daytime) moving in a V-shape.  The speed of the objects (compared to the lower-altitude commercial plane) was seemingly much slower.  The fleet was so far away and so faint in the sky, if we looked away and looked back, it took several moments to be able to find them again.  We watched for about 5 minutes as the shape shifted a bit, but stayed mostly in a V formation, as they traveled from Northwest to Southeast.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
