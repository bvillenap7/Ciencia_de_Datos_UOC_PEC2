Three UFOs disguised as Clouds;1982-06-15 19:00:00;5 minutes;Three UFOs disguised as Clouds Back in 1982 when I was living on Staten Island, I was in a shopping plaza on Hylan Blvd, when I noticed off in the distance, some very low flying objects coming towards me. The sky was bright and clear. They were flying in a triangle formation. When they were close enough for me to identify them, they looked like three burning, smoking clouds.  They were no more than 200 feet high, and they passed almost directly overhead. The bottom of these clouds looked like pure flame, violently churning inward toward the middle. The tops of these clouds were sort of bubbling, as the smoke did not rise in a column, but stayed with the body of these clouds of flame and smoke.  I have never seen clouds like this before, nor have I seen any since. Some might think that the sun was setting, so the bottom of the clouds were reflecting the sun, but very high in the sky, I could see white clouds, and for them not to reflect the same red from the sun should be proof enough that it was not taken at sunset.  These three clouds made no sound as they passed overhead at about two hundred feet, and traveling 60 to 80 miles an hour. These three clouds looked totally out of place for the sky above them. As they traveled toward me, a small amount of smoke did trail off from them. I remember the feeling of the hairs on my arm standing up, but I attributed this to static electricity.  I remember thinking how weird, and unnatural they looked, but my first thought was they were some kind of tempture anomaly. Now all this would be left up to speculation, and disbelief if it wasn't for the fact that I had a still camera with me, and I took pictures of these three strange clouds as they came toward me.  It wasn't until the movie Independence Day that I ever saw anything like clouds associated with UFOs. Recently I was listening to a program on television, and heard someone talking about UFOs that hid in a cloud or appeared like clouds. This made me look for the photos I have had for so long. I have found two of the three pictures I know I have. Two coming toward me, and one after they passed by and moving away from me. The two I have found should allow for a good investigation since they were taken close together, and you can see how the clouds details have changed in that short period of time. Below the clouds are buildings so I'm sure a scale can be made from the pictures, and possibly the speed at which they traveled. If NUFORC is interested in the photos, please email me. Before I release them for investigation, I will have them copyrighted. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date above are approximate.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Three fast moving violently churning out of place red and black clouds;1987-06-01 15:00:00;5 Minutes;Three fast moving violently churning out of place red and black clouds The date and time of this occurance is my best guess from memory. I knew what I had taken a close up photo of, but everyone I showed it to back then either laughed, or llooked at me like I was crazy. I put the photos away and for years they just sat in a box. Then I saw the movie Independence Day, and it reminded me of my photos. I had three, but I have lost one which I believe would have been proof positive, since it was traveling away from me and not towards me as they are in the two photos I have and want to send to you.  The location of the photo, was Fox Plaza on Hylan Blvd, near New Dorp Lane in Staten Island. I noticed off in the distance, three very strange looking clouds traveling in a V formation from northeast to southwest. If I were to guess their speed, I would have to say eighty (80) to one hundred (100) miles an hour. As they passed me they were almost directly over Hylan Blvd where the traffice was moving at 45 MPH. They were traveling at least twice as fast as the cars they passed over. As you can see in the photos, the direction from which they came had white and golden clouds, so these three very dark clouds were very out of place. What caught my eye was the violent churning of the clouds. The tops were black, whwile the bottom of each was flaming red. The bottom red part of the cloud was churning up into the middle of the cloud. To best describe it imagine a fuel explosion where a rising cloud of burning vapor is churning up and into itself. From the time I first saw it, and till it disappeared, the violent churning motion was clearly visible.  However, these three clouds never rose but did maintain a constant and steady speed, maintaining their formation.  These clouds did leave a trail which can be seen in the photos as puffy trails of smoke. They made no sound at all as they passed almost directly overhead. As I watched them I had this very erie feeling, and when they passed overhead at about a hundred and fifty feet, the hair on my arms stood up. I am sure that you can determine their speed since there are buildings in the photos. Please look at the puffs left behind, and the white clouds, and then at the UFOs, and how much they changed their shape in a matter of seconds. As I said, the inward churning of these clouds was very violent. I have never had any doubt since I took the photos of what they are. I only wish it were a motion picture camera I had that day so everything would have been recorded in real time instead of snapshots.

cigar shaped slender long ufo observed for a minute with subseqeunt absence of the object after just about 10 to 15 seconds of not look;2002-05-20 11:30:00;about 60 seconds;cigar shaped slender long ufo observed for a minute with subseqeunt absence of the object after just about 10 to 15 seconds of not look i was in my 3rd year of residency at that time. while reading for a test up in the resident's room around 11:30 am i looked up at the window, and saw a gray colored pipe-like object(cigar shaped) at about 2000 to 2500 feet from the 12th floor of the hospital where i was. this was approximately over a key foods supermarket or a little more distant from the site. it was stationary and did not look like a balloon. it must have been about the length of three fighters end to end from that distance, as far as i can surmise, but slender. i could make out small angular projections around the right one-third of the object taking my right side as a reference. i did not see any transparent areas or lights. i could hear no sound. since i was reading for a test, i could not give any more attention to this stationary object, unfortunately. i looked down to read a few lines and when i looked up in about 10 to 15 seconds or so(due to curiosity as to what it was) it was no longer there! in my opinion it wasn't a balloon, or a conventional aircraft. i recounted it excitedly to my wife when i got back in the evening. i have not forgotten the brief sighting after all these years, and wrote about it briefly to some organization working with texas division of mufon, after a few years, and got an e-mail saying that it would be relayed to mufon head in texas or something like that. i did not have any further contacts after that and did not know to report it to national center for ufo reporting at that time. some of the pictures that i have seen of cigar shaped objects in ufo documentaries look very much like what i saw. it is very much in my memory bank.

Lights over New York City;2003-09-06 23:30:00;1 hour;Lights over New York City I live in Manhattan and a student at Columbia University Medical School. I live in an apartment on the 29th floor with bay windows with sky views of the Hudson River, New Jersey, planes lading towards Newark Airport, La Guardia Airport, and Queens. I've noticed on a slight foggy night about Mid August an unidentified white light glowing floating object-size of a blimp, just standing still over the New Jersey side of the Hudson River.  I assumed it was probably a blimp floating at night because in the day, blimps fly over my window advertising for Saturn, Fuji, etc-it stayed there for 1-2hours. I didn't pay much attention b/c i thought it was probably a blimp until I noticed the same object in a non-foggy night sky last night. I noticed the same object, behind the LaGuardia Aiport floating but smaller because it was farther away and higher. The lights on this thing was similar to the object seen over the New Jersey side of the Hudson, but the lights alternated from red to white in periods of 10seconds apart. It stayed in the air, moving slowly and standing still for about 1 hour.  The airport scheduled continued b/c the incoming airplanes were landing at the airport. There were city helicopters flying over the sky in other directions-with the police lights, but nothting bothered the object. The lights on this object differed in pattern blinking, size, and color than all the other lights on the other aircraft that was flying in the sky last night. It slowly drifted away.

His sighting appear to be the same as mines being that they saw 3 object heading east with two crafts flying together while the 3rd was a bit apart (in my case 2 ships apart and trailing 10 seconds behind. What I would like to know is if the crafts that Vancouver saw was traveling horizontal to earth or at an angle as most pitures and drawings that we see of triangle crafts. Because I originaly reported it as a cigar shape but what if what I saw was a side profile of the triangle, like seeing the rim of a book.  ****  note **** The skies were still blue at 19:30 about 1/2 hour away from sunset.  Vancouver, WA to Brooklyn, NY is 3000 miles apart. WA reported it at 13:55 (PDT) that's 15:55 (EST). I made my report at 19:30 (EST).  If it is possible that we seen the same 3 craft then it must have travled at the speed of 1000 MPH to reach my area in 3 hours +.  When the object came in from the horizon at 260 deg SW flew at the closest point over my house I ran from the back yard to the front ( 60' ) just to see it come out from over my house and head NE at 80 deg toward Long Island.  As I stated in a previous post, after the sightings, I veiwed a commericial jet plane ( close enough where you know it's a plane but can't tell what airline and about the same size as the crafts) flew over the same path at about the same speed it took the crafts to reach and pass over my house.  So if a plane cruises about the speed of 500 MPH and the craft travels at 1000 MPh and they both took about the same time to cross over my house then is it possible that that crafts were twice the size of a jumbo and were flying twice as high giving the illusion that it was the sze of a jumbo and needed to travel more distace then a plane to cross over my home.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

the lights were streaming straight across and i was fascinated;2009-06-19 08:44:00;30 minutes;the lights were streaming straight across and i was fascinated Occurred: June 19, 2009 (8:44)  Location: Brooklyn NY  Shape: flat disk  Duration:30 minutes   I had just finished eating and went to play with my brothers in the kitchen.  Three minutes passed  and I was walking across the kitchen when I see a flat disk.   I first thought it was a plane but it was staying still floating in the air planes cant stay still they have to move forward so I went to my window and saw it was flat. I instantly thought thought it was a U.F.O (Unidentified Flying Object) , and I was shocked because I always wanted to see one.  Suddenly its lights start flickering and the lights streamed across going from red to green to purple white blue and all sorts of colors.  I was so amazed the first thing that came to my mind was camera.  I went to my room to get a camera and I came back and started to take pictures but there was a tree blocking it and it was fairly 500 yards away.   I then try to zoom in and move around the tree but when I got a good shot my  camera screen turned blue like some sort of static water picture. I tried to take pictures but all it would take is blue images. I then called my friend to see if he can see it.  But then it just  starts to faint away and becomes invisible but when a minute passes it comes back brighter again streaming with colors.  I then heard police sirens because someone had called the police.  It kept disappearing and appearing again and again like about three times for about half a hour then it disappears and doesn’t appear back.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

4 Silver Cigar Shaoed Crafts Over Brooklyn;2019-09-20 15:30:00;2 hours;4 Silver Cigar Shaoed Crafts Over Brooklyn Friday September 20, 2019. I looked out my window in Brooklyn, NY, and saw a very clear trail of exhaust in the sky.  Out of curiosity I stood by the window observing and marking the time down. I happen to live in an area where airplanes regularly fly on a few set routes and I have gotten to know their pace/speed and general flight paths (severe weather permitting). There are also frequently helicopters flying slightly lower in the sky than the planes. The craft leaving behind a clear and consistent trail was moving at a remarkable speed . I almost felt as if I'd miss the entire event altogether. The craft showed a clear and low starting point and moved upwards into the sky and then proceeded to stay level at a certain altitude but moved rapidly from West to East.  When it reached a certain area which I believe was over Queens, the trail abruptly stopped and the silver object leading it vanished. I continued to watch for its reappearance but it did not resurface. At this point I then saw another identical object do the exact same thing from the exact same starting point. This happened a total of 3 times with completely identical stories. The entire time was about 30 minutes but the individual flight for each was under a minute and the craft must have traveled miles during this time. The trails left behind were still strong and did not disappear or fade at all for at least an hour. As I mentioned earlier, I am also near airplane flight paths and the difference in speed between the two was too great to ignore. I also observed several, at least 3, black helicopters which seemed to be monitoring and following this event. One more craft started from the same point, this is a 4th, and was the same color and size and shape but instead of going West to East, it traveled upwards (North). The details are identical to the above statement but it happened about 30 minutes after I observed the first three which occurred pretty much one after the other every 10 minutes. I did not see any lights, I did not hear any noises or witness anything aside from what I have listed above.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
