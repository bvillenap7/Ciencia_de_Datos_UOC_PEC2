On the night of July 20,1977 on or about 02:00hrs. This night was extremley hot and muggy (Clear night) so I went up to my roof to cool off as I laid there I observed what appeared to be a triagle shape object, one side was longer than the other. The left side had 2 + the point light (glowing red), the right side had 3 + point light (glowing red). What happen next is these lights shot across the sky (left and right)the point light stayed in place, then came back together. At that time it flew straight up and disapeared.

Trianglar Dream sightings;1987-04-10 13:00:00;unknown;Trianglar Dream sightings This is not a visual sighting of a UFO. As far back as I can remember since I was 7 years old (this is before Aliens became pop culture and ufo images were casted into our minds) I've kept having reoccuring dreams of a Trianglar shape aircraft hovering over me. The craft had blue lights at each corner (as far as I can remember) and a srobe light directly in the middle of the this craft that was always shining on me. I may have had this dream more than 10 times through out my childhood from 7-15 years old. After looking at some depictions (graphics) on your site showing these similar crafts, I felt sick to my stomach. I don't know why I was giving those dreams, and could never find any source of dream sightings. I must clearify that I never physically seen this object while awake, only in my dreams when I was a kid. I'm now 27 years old and still can remember them clearly. I was told by a family memeber whom also had these dream sightings that he feels that these objects are monitoring us. I feel something sinister is present every time of those dreams. Please help me to understand them, even if it means a hyptnosis session. I'm ready to know the truth. Thank You for this opportunity. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I was walking home from work about 8-9pm, 12/18 for a fact, possibly '94, '95, or'96 ...going down Lexington Ave in Midtown NYC...walking by like 29th or 28th street in front of Rocky's Bar, when I saw several people and 4 Cops looking straight up into the sky... I almost kept walking...but something in me said, no look, don't be an idiot ... so I followed their eyes up, up, up and WOW!  way up beyond what seemed for some reason like fake clouds was a HUGE plane-like triangleish shape with several lights at various points (which might have blinked different colors) which when I connected the dots in my mind the first thought I had was:  Space Shuttle.  But this was MUCH, MUCH bigger, at about 1000 feet up I could bracket it with my hands being about 8 inches apart... As more people walked by some stopped till there were about 20 people watching....just looking at each other and oohing and aahing and saying  oh my god  oh my god ... the 4 cops were shaking their heads, shuffling their feet,  and putting their hands on their heads like they were wondering whether or not they were going to report this...or just agree to all keep their mouths shut... one Cop next to me looked at me and we shook our heads and he said...Definitely a UFO  and I said definitely a UF Something ... after about 5 minutes or so, the craft started rising up into the sky and it got smaller as it rose and went completely out of sight into the clouds or fog...  I started walking home amazed...it had been my 3rd UFO sighting (my first being '78/79 over Poughkeepsie, NY) and  by far the best....a few blocks down was a guy standing outside the old Tom O'Reilly's bar across from the Armory on Lexington & 26th...he was looking straight up with his hands forming a viewfinder ar! ound his eyes as if to focus better... I started to ask him HEY, did you see...  when he cut me off and said something like that big thing in the sky? yeah!  Did you?  Were you up there (pointing to where I'd been) by all the cops?   I said yeah! wasn't that amazing? and he went YEAH!  And then a buddy of his came out of the deli next door and he screamed his name and said that he'd just saw something up in the sky and that I had to and had been standing a couple blocks away with about 20 people including 4 cops...and I confimed that to his friend and we were both very excited and pumped up...and at that, as though he at least now had a friend as a witness who had at least witnessed me confirming the sighting and the crowd and the cops, he went running back into the bar screaming HEY GUYS!  HEY GUYS! .... ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

Boomerang-shape, dividing? objects.;1996-10-06 15:00:00;15-20 minutes;Boomerang-shape, dividing? objects. At about 3pm in the afternoon of October 6th 1996, my friend and I were laying on the track at the field on 6th Street doing situps.  My friend noticed something way, way up in the sky as if it were a star.  The sky was clear blue with just a few fluffy-like clouds scattered.  When I squinted to look at what he was looking at, I noticed a dark, greyish-metallic looking object which looked about the size that a star would look like at night.  The object was stationary, it did not move.  As I focused on the object, all of the sudden it took off toward the south at a high speed and went out of my sight.  This object went from stationary to high speed movement in no time at all.  I yelled at my friend so he could see that it had taken off, and he claimed it hadn't because he was still focused on the object.  I lay back down next to him on the track and began focusing on yet another object of the same description.  It was just there in the sky not moving.  Aparently, this second object was the one he noticed first, and when I looked, my eyes caught sight of the one that was next to it and took off.  As we stared at the object, something incredible and inexplicable happend.  The object began to wobble as we focused more on the object, we could see it was a triangular-boomerang shape.  My friend who has better vision than I said it had a orange-like glow to it as well.  As the object wobbled, amazingly, another object just like it came forth from it as if it had divided itself into two.  I know it sounds crazy or made up, but I will swear under oath and take a lie detector test or whatever is necessary, that this is what we both saw.  Now, there were two objects side by side.  The object that came out of the other one moved east slightly, so now they were aligned side by side.  I cannot recall which of the two began wobbling now, I want to say it was the original one that spit the new one out because I recall the third object being directly above the original or mother object. In any case the! object began wobbling again and yet another one seemed to appear from the other. Now there were three, one above the original one and the other still aligned alongside the original one.  At once, all three formed a triangle and stood there for a few minutes in triangular formation.  After a few minutes, the top one moved slowly along side the others so that they were now on the same level side by side.  The two in front now began to move together slowly eastward and the original or mother one stood still.  As we watched, the original one began to move as well, the two moving ahead together, in the same eastward direction.  Then they all picked up speed and disappeared East. This incident has haunted me and my friend all these years.  I was tempted many times to report this to someone, but did not know where or who.  I have seen other unexplained objects in the sky, but this was the most remarkable.  If anyone else has seen something like this I would love to know.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Strangely moving craft, zigzagging in the distance that turned out to be a huge triangle with lots of lights when it flew overhead..;1998-05-01 18:30:00;5 - 10 minutes;Strangely moving craft, zigzagging in the distance that turned out to be a huge triangle with lots of lights when it flew overhead.. I'm an outreach worker with the homeless in NYC and me and partner were headed to our dinner break in the van when we saw an object flying erratically in the area of lower manhattan. We were in midtown, around 54th Street and traffic was very heavy so we were basically crawling along. I was driving. So we spot this 'plane' flying east to west and then appearing to hover and just acting in a way we'd never seen a plane act before. My partner was in the military service and he's familiar with planes but he was just as dumbfounded as i was at the way it was acting. So as we were driving south on 9th Avenue, we are keeping our eyes on this 'plane' and suddenly it started to fly straight in our direction. We said 'Great, now we can see what kind of plane this is'...it must have moved really fast because suddenly it just seemed to glide right over us and that was when we saw it wasn't a plane but this HUGE triangle thing with many, many round lights underneath. The lights were arranged in triangular rows and there were three rows of them in the shape of the craft if you can picture that. They were very bright but did not give off any glare. This was just before sunset. We hung out the window as we were stopped at the light. Next to us was a woman in a jeep and she looked to see what we were staring at wide mouthed and she got a little hysterical, pretty much as dumbfounded as we were. The thing made no sound at all.

Object zig zagging east to west and stopping in distance turned out to be huge triangle with many lights when it flew directly overhead;1998-09-15 18:30:00;10 minutes;Object zig zagging east to west and stopping in distance turned out to be huge triangle with many lights when it flew directly overhead I was headed to dinner break with my partner (i was driving) heading downtown on Ninth Avenue around 56th Street when we both noticed a light behaving strangely in the sky. It was just around dusk and must have been in late summer. We took our break at 7:00 pm and were about three miles from our destination in heavy traffic. We were both used to seeing planes and helicopters in the sky as NYC gets a lot of air traffic and the area where we were looking in lower Manhattan was a popular flight path. But this thing was zig zagging in the sky and then coming to a complete stop. It seemed impossible. My partner is a veteran of the armed forces and he and i had never discussed the subject of ufo's. We kept our eye on the object while speculating as to what kind of plane could be capable of that kind of flight and why it would be doing that in what is a heavy air traffic corridor but could come up with nothing. We continued to drive south, in the direction of the object when we saw it change path. While it had been zig zagging from east to west and back again it suddenly started to head north in our direction. We were stopped at the red light and i cannot tell you how but it must have been moving very fast because it just seemed like all of sudden it went from an indistinguishable bright object to a huge triangle with many, many round lights on the bottom of it and it was directly overhead. My partner and i each had our heads out our respective windows just saying 'what the @#&@!% is that thing!?'. There so many lights. There must have been three rows of lights following the shape of the triangle. The lights were completely round, big and gave no glare. We could make out no landing gear, no windows and it made no sound. It was dark silver or gray-silver in color. No one on the street was looking up but this woman in a jeep who was stopped at the light next to us (we were high up in a van) looked up when she saw our expressions and she got the same look we must have had, laughing and yet dumbfou! nded at the same time. The light changed and the object continued north overhead and we went to work and told our supervisor who didn't really believe us. But i swear this really happened. To this day, if you walk on the streets of NYC you will see that New Yorkers just do not look up. I can't explain why neither my partner or i didn't yell at people to look up, but i think we were just too shocked and trying to make sense of what were seeing and then the light changed and it was gone behind us. I think it was huge because we could see it so clearly when it passed over us, yet we hadn't seen it descend and must have been fairly high up. It's hard for me to speculate on this as i have no clue about how to calculate distance and size in the sky.  My partner and i were doing outreach with the homeless at the time this happened. As i said he is a veteran of the army. I have done social work most of my life. We are both New Yorkers. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Black Tetrahedron Pyramid UFO in plain daylight over New York City.;1999-08-07 17:00:00;4-5 minutes;Black Tetrahedron Pyramid UFO in plain daylight over New York City. Black Tetrahedron Pyramid UFO   This sighting occurred back in August 7, 1999. On that particular Saturday mid-afternoon day.  A friend and I decided to take a walk down to Riverbank State Park on 145th Manhattan, NY.  We've been there a few times before since he lived and worked at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital a few blocks north from there.  It was our favorite place to hang out and just enjoy the scenery.  From that park you could see over to New Jersey,  The George Washington Bridge, and Downtown and basically up the Hudson River valley as well on a clear day.  My friend and I got to the park and walked all the way down to the south corner of the park next to the basketball courts act... We sat down on the benches right next to the rail facing the Hudson River.  We spoke about work, family, daily normal everyday things, act.... At one point during our conversation I stood up and walked next to the rail and leaned against the rail with my back towards the Hudson River.  My friend lay down on the bench and we kept talking until I for some strange reason looked up and noticed 3 or 4 star-liked objects just hovering motionless to the east of where i was standing.  I asked my friend to stand up and see something strange up in the sky and so he did.  He told me something around, Oh what those stars there, but then he told me it's weird we're not supposed to see stars that bright during the day. Then I told him that they’re probably satellites or even balloons and we just basically brush it off and kept talking about other stuff. We stood there for a few more hours.  Then around 5:00pm or so we decided to go get something to eat at a nearby McDonalds and basically started walking back north to exit the park.  As we were walking north right beside the river I noticed again for some strange reason what looked like a Black dot in the sky. It stood out to me because the sky was completely blue no clouds, haze nothing. This object was hovering motionless near the Manhattan side of the G.W.Bridge precisely on top or near 3 tall buildings used by Columbia Presbyterian Hospital as dorms for medical students or something my friend told me.  He knew since like I said he worked at the hospital in the Administration Dept.  I found it very odd so I ask my friend to walk fast to nearby sight-seeing binoculars that they have in that park to see over to New Jersey, G. W. Bridge act…  At the same time that I was walking I was looking in my jeans pocket for 50 cents to paid in order to use the binoculars and happens to be that I had precisely that 2 quarters so I got to the machine put the money and first located the G.W. Bridge since it was the biggest thing, then located the 3 buildings nearby and then moved the binoculars a little up from the buildings and lord behold there was the “Black! Dot” which wasn’t really a “Black Dot” but a Black Tetrahedro! n Pyramid Object sitting motionless on an angle right on top of one of the buildings. This object was completely black. It had not markings what so ever, no symbols, letters, windows, and doors I mean nothing. It was just black sort of gun metal black. The only thing that had in each bottom corners was plasma-like circular lights. These lights emanated some sort of heat. Sort of like the sun, yes they reminded me of the sun. It was like it had 3 suns in each corner.  The object also didn’t rotate or nothing it was just there motionless.   At that point I was just ecstatic in a euphoric state debating whether I was seeing this or if it was all in my mind.  I quickly turn to my friend which was standing right next to me asking me what was what I was seeing.  Why I was reacting the way I was reacting. I told him you have to see this come so I let him used the binoculars and told him where to look so he did but he couldn’t see find it. I looked with my eyes to see if I saw the black dot but it just vanish as quickly as it appeared.  The rest of the day we just spoke about what had happened. I almost forgot to mention that prior to seen the triangle I had seen a black helicopter pass us by when we were walking towards the binoculars to see what the black dot was.  This army type helicopter was really low to the river.  I found that very odd.  This particular sighting is just one of many sightings I have had since childhood.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Three of us were out fishing on the West 125th street peir in Harlem.  I ususally put my fishing rod inside of the pipe that holds the fence up over the water.  As usual my friends and I were caught up in a conversation.  I walked over to where my pole was standind in side the fence pole and looked up at the tip to see if I was getting a bite. It was a clear fall night, and the sky was full of stars.  I could hear my friends talking as I stared up toward the sky, at my pole tip.  Suddenly, I noticed the stars moving, I thought! I started to recieve an adreniline rush from my heart, because what I thought was moving stars turned out to be a triangular shape silently moving across the sky towards New Jersey.  I froze staring at the the shape moving slowly, and I began to listen for my friends to say that they saw what I was looking at, but they didn't.  I said, Oh, (S)-word.!  Did yoll see that?  They responded, What did you get a hit?  I said, No!  That UFO!  They told me I was on drugs laughed and continued talking.  I looked back at the sky for the object and I got one more glimpse and it disappeared.  I asked them again, and the said they didn't see anything.  I know what I saw!  And, it wasn't no plane either.

The noises I heard from the phone could have been a launguage, but I could not understand a word of it. After my phone went dead It left a few seconds later.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Triangular Starlike Object/Craft at the 2002 NYC 4th of July East River Fireworks;2002-07-04 20:48:00;15-20 minutes;Triangular Starlike Object/Craft at the 2002 NYC 4th of July East River Fireworks On July 4th, 2002,  NYC, 20:45, I was setting up a video camera at the rooftop (southeast manhattan) aimed at the weird starlike object (west) that I was staking out for the last 2 weeks of June. I had with me (on loan courtesy of my friend) a Sony Hi-8 72x zoom with tripod to validate what I have been seeing. It was a beautiful night, moderately cloudy to clear At 20:48, before the East River fireworks, I was filming towards (west) a triangular starlike object. The Triangular Starlike Object came to watch the East River fireworks. I guess who wouldn't miss this one in a new york minute I zoomed in at 72x west at the starlike object. A triangular object/craft emerged from my viewfinder. It is a glowing red triangular body with green on the edges. In normal eyesight, It is luminous white (like a star) but seems so near to the earth's atmosphere (size) to be a star. I started video recording a triangular object (like an inverted top) with white lights rotating at the base. I also noticed portholes rotating just above the rotating white lights and a smaller portholes underneath it. I have approximately 15 minutes video footage of this triangular object/craft.  It hid behind the clouds before the fireworks began. I have submitted choice video stills at jpg format to Mr. Peter Davenport. I also have the video footages of the event plus the fireworks. ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report and the images, which have been forwarded to our Center.  The object is triangular in nature, with several lights at the bottom.  We do not know what it is.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Triangular Bright White Object Over NYC  Moving West to East  4:42 am.;2003-05-20 04:43:00;20 Seconds;Triangular Bright White Object Over NYC  Moving West to East  4:42 am. Observing planets with a Leitz 7x35 BA Trinovid Binocular. Western direction. I spotted a very bright, moving object. The object was moving East. The object was much bigger than most satellites I normally view. Here in New York City, or out in East Hampton, NY. Even with severe light pollution, Visuals are not that difficult for part of the track across the sky. Less than half and hour earlier, I tracked one moving south to north. Same exact location facing West. Same location for me. Both moving objects, were 45 or so degrees off the horizon. I lost the satellite for a moment, and went back to the planets. The satellite: Small, dim, moving fast, but heavy light pollution. The Object I am speaking of, was moving slightly slower, in my estimation, than most satellites I view. I do not, at all, think it was a commercial aircraft. No standard lighting configuration. Nothing but solid white light, tinged, with yellow. No contrails. Fighter jets have been on station around NYC. They strobe their lights, change the configuration, Turn them on and off. Any Ideas? Explainable for sure. Maybe?;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Triange shaped object moving across the sky in New York City on a Lunar eclipse;2003-11-08 20:15:00;1 minute;Triange shaped object moving across the sky in New York City on a Lunar eclipse We were standing ontop of a building on 30th and 7th ave busy watching the Lunar eclipse.  Suddenly person 1 saw an object which was moving across the sky at a fast pace.  We all saw it.  It had a triangle shape *glider shape* but had an extra bump adjacent on the triangle shape.  At first it looked like a piece of toilet paper flying through the sky, but this was a fixed shape.  Then we thought it was a glider, but the shape was wrong and it was too high and much to big to be a glider.  It wasnt a plane, definitely wasn't a plane because we could not hear any sounds coming from it.  It took about 1 minute to streak across the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Time is approximate.

I managed to take one picture but it is slightly blurry and doesn't do the object justice.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Stationary Triangular Shaped Object with red lights on its edges.;2003-12-28 18:00:00;just passed by (car);Stationary Triangular Shaped Object with red lights on its edges. The only reason I reported this, because I was not sure if it was a craft, since it was dark, but the second I noticed someone posting very similar report and not very far away from here.  Here is this person's quote Tirangular-shaped object hovered over New York State Thruway on September 27  I was driving home from a friend's house on the night of Saturday, September 27,2003. I took the N.Y.State Thruway home. I was traveling alone. Somewhere between the Catskill and Coxsackie exits I saw a triangular-shaped object approaching from the north-west. It moved very slowly and hovered over the lane I was in. It had 3 red lights along it's points that did not flash. As it moved over my car I looked up through my windshield and saw the body of the craft. It was a matte gray. My windows were closed so I could not discern if there was sound or not.  A mile or two before this occured, I noticed a police car along along the left side of the Thruway. All traffic slowed down because of this. Once this object appeared, all cars accelerated to speeds of 80-85mph. I know others saw this and I want to find out if anyone else has reported a sighting on this night.  I am a public school teacher in New York.  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/032/S32150.html  While we were going home on a local road, I saw a stationary triangular object (black) over the trees. Interestingly this exactly matches the description of the person I quoted what I saw. It was triangular (perfect triangle), and had red lights along its points (did not blink). Thought it appeared black to me, probably because it was dark, however gray color that was reported would be close enough to my witness since it was daylight for the other person. I can bet 100% a gray object would appear black in the dark. Also this object did not make any sound.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

On August 29th 2004 at 1:30pm Eastern Time,  My girlfriend and I were on a bus toward the Lincoln Tunnel.  We were riding adjacent to the husdon river and had a perfect view of the New York City Sky line.  I looked out my window and could see this triangle shaped object hovering directly above the Empire State Building.  What caught my attention was that it hovered under a blimp for a moment, stopped and moved from east to west and back again, like a pendulum. How does a Helicoper hover under a blimp?  It also hovered down as if trying to touch the tip of the Empire State Building and then back up again. We observed the object until our view was obstructed as the bus approached the tunnel.  There is something else I could not explain.  It would suddenly flash, as if the sun would casue it to glare but very suddenly and briefly, a metallic color.  FLASH.  It did this 3 times as if it were spinning and the shiny part would hit the sun.  I tried to believe it was a helicopter but their was a helicopter flying over the hudson river to the right of the object, (The Blimp was to the left) and I could clearly see all three objects in a clear cloudless sky.  I cannot verify that this was not a helicopter becasue of depth perception but my girlfriend agreed on the shape and odd flash.  With all the security, tight US Airspace and in the midst of one of the biggest protests in history in the middle of the Republican Convention I cannot be sure how such an object flying so low was not noticed.  I didn't see anyone else post any similar accounts so I may be wrong, Cest La Vie.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Was outside with my daughter observing the lunar eclipse  Looked to the far left of the moon and saw an odd shape against a few stars. If I hadn't been looking at that exact spot I never would of seen it. It almost looked transparant. I pointed it out to my daughter and she said it's a ship!. It was gliding slowly north to south coming directly toward us over our heads. Four times the size of a 747. Ship had no lights and made no sound. At first looked like a boomerang, where its front edges reflected a dull faint gray. As the ship moved above our heads it blotted out the few stars. It was a triangle. Scraed and excited us at the same time.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

odd looking flashing orb above ground zero-World Trade Center & triangle craft with non-blinking white lights on each corner;2007-05-02 20:00:00;2 hours;odd looking flashing orb above ground zero-World Trade Center & triangle craft with non-blinking white lights on each corner My apartment is facing towards the world trade area , so I actually have a good panoramic view of the city hall skyline (verizon building to police headquarters)- the skies being clear. It's around 8pm and I thought, I was looking at a star but, I use a pair of binoculars(20x50)- I'm on the 10th floor. To the northwest, I see an object that looked like a satellite but, the object stopped right above Ground zero right next to the millenium hotel on chambers street. As I looked using my binoculars, there wasn't any sound or tail section(what helicopters have) it was more rectangular-bottle shaped and there were 4 flashing red lights in sequence on both sides, one blue light on each side & either a reflection of white light(non-blinking) on the rest of the object. The object would go suddenly go straight up, then down as well as fly left to right instantly without tilting. After, 1 hour & 57 minutes the object went northwest again, the lights started to fade. The other objects(non-blinking white lights)being I counted 5 surrouding another object shaped in a perfect triangle with white non-blinking lights on each corner of the object. There was a foggish haze around all the objects except the 1 flashing object near the world trade center. As, I checked again visually & the use of the binoculars around 10pm eastern time, all the objects aren't there at all.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
We saw a triangle UFO fly by our window in Brooklyn.;2007-06-30 18:35:00;About 2 Minutes;We saw a triangle UFO fly by our window in Brooklyn. I live one block away from the south side of Prospect Park in Brooklyn, New York.  Me and my friend were watching a movie in my room.  My friend went to the window to have a cigarette and noticed a blackish object in the sky. He said it was very still when he first saw it but when I came over to look at it it moved very fast to my left. By the time I got my phone out to take a picture it had already moved half way across my window. It paused for a second a couple of times and seemed to drop down and then come back up into sight almost right away. It was shaped kind of like a triangle and was a dark metallic color. It didn't reflect the sun or glow or anything. The date was 2007, June 30 around 6:30 PM. I think we were pretty close to it but I couldn't hear any sounds like I'd expect a plane to make. I'm not sure how fast it was moving I'd guess that it was definitely faster than any airplane I ever saw. I apologizer for the low quality of the photographs. The only camera we had was my cell phone and it was moving too fast for me to catch it in the frame. After I took these pictures, it disappeared behind the red building you see in the left corner of the pictures so I couldn't get another shot.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Silent V-Shaped Craft seen flying over Brooklyn NY!;2012-11-19 00:35:00;7-10 seconds;Silent V-Shaped Craft seen flying over Brooklyn NY! I live in Brooklyn, New York.  Right across the East River in Williamsburg, giving me a clean shot of the Lower East Side, Manhattan and the surrounding skyline from the roof top of my apartment building.  To the Northeast I can see the Queens-based La Guardia airport and almost directly South is JFK.  I sit outside a few times every night to have a cigarette and pay very close attention to the sky and I know what conventional aircraft look like.  Since it’s NYC I’ve seen plenty of military craft as well, aircraft that the normal Joe-Schmoe doesn’t see every day.  Anything from F16 Fighter Jets, Sikorsky VH-3D Helicopters (when the President is in town), Chinook helicopters and once I even saw an Osprey flying over the East River Harbor.  Long story short, I’m very used to seeing unconventional craft in the sky as well. I stepped outside onto my roof for a cigarette around 12:30am, as I normally do (since I don’t smoke inside my apartment) and when I looked up, I noticed how bright the stars were.  There aren’t many nights in New York City when the stars are visible.  There wasn’t a cloud in the sky and I was enjoying being able to see Orion’s Belt as I puffed away.  Then it came into my line of vision.  A very mysterious craft or UFO that flew directly over my head!  Now I can see planes flying into both Airports nearby and not once has any commercial flight flown directly overhead of my building.  If this craft was the size of a normal commercial flight, then it was flying at a severely low altitude.   It was very hard to comprehend the size, especially because there was no noise.  If it was a large commercial flight then it was way too low for FAA regulations, especially this close to Ground Zero (9/11).  The best explanation from what I directly witnessed, is it was flying at a high alt! itude and was just immensely huge, possibly the length of a football field.  It was in my line of vision for around 7-10 seconds before it disappeared behind the Williamsburg Bridge.  I ran down the fire escape on the side of my building praying that I would catch a glimpse of it again once it passed the bridge, or at least see some FAA lights.  Nothing.  It was gone, as so were my chances to photograph it. The best way to describe it is the typical V-Shape that is pretty common in UFO sightings.  There were 5 lights.  One at the tip, then two down each side, perfectly symmetrical and at a perfect angle.  The lights were very large, circular and the light emitted was diffused, almost as if they were behind a haze.  Remember it was clear enough to see Orion’s Belt directly across from Manhattan, so it was a crystal clear night.  Other planes that were further away by miles had sharper looking lights and were more visible.   I was glad that I was looking at the stars or I would have never seen it because of how muted it was.  There were NO FAA lights on it whatsoever.  No headlights, no beacon lights, no red lights and definitely nothing flashing.  The lights that were present were a very soft white-yellowish color and did NOT flash. The body looked to follow the contours of the lights although it was hard to make out a solid surface.  It was almost like you could see through the! craft while just making out the signatures of its edges but I couldn’t see the stars behind it.  There was no sound what so ever.  It seemed to fly at a high speed very effortlessly. When I had realized what I had seen it took my breath away.  My heart jumped straight up into my throat and I actually had a hard time breathing for a minute and I think I mumbled the “f” word to myself a few times.  I am 100% convinced that what I saw, I was not supposed to have seen.  It was very faint, lasted only for a few seconds, and was unlike anything I’ve ever seen in the night sky or in my life for that matter.  I’m not saying that it was extraterrestrial, but if it wasn’t then it was some sort of top-secret aircraft that hasn’t been disclosed by the government.  It is something that I will remember for the rest of my life.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Saw three orange orbs moving steadily, hovering, and then traveling vast distances within seconds, over Brooklyn, NY.;2014-06-22 22:17:00;~2 minutes;Saw three orange orbs moving steadily, hovering, and then traveling vast distances within seconds, over Brooklyn, NY. On June 22, 2014, I was sitting on my private outdoor rooftop in Brooklyn, NY, (Williamsburg) with a friend of mine.  I watch the sky every night - I can usually find Mars if it is visible, can identify numerous constellations, know the difference between a satellite and an airplane, and just love to stare out into space.   At about 10:17 PM, I was looking at the sky as I always do, but it wasn't a very clear night and very few stars were visible due to the massive light pollution created by the New York City lights.   Out of the corner of my eye I noticed an orange glowing orb of light.  After doing a quick double-take, I saw there were actually three orbs of light moving across the sky in a way I have NEVER seen any craft or airplane or satellite move - ever.  It was completely silent and seemed to float through the air.  I instantly knew I was seeing a UFO I had absolutely no doubt in my mind. In the midst of my excitement/awe/disbelief, I grabbed my iPhone and tried to record as much as I could (I knew that if I didn't capture this experience no one would ever believe me).  The orbs of light moved across the sky and I took my first video but to the blind eye and without the technology needed to slow down the video, all I could see was the black night sky.  I had a feeling that nothing was on that video and quickly tried to take another one before it was too late.  Fortunately,  I was able to switch the camera on in time and record what I did.  For two weeks I didn't think I had captured anythng, until I decided to watch the videos on my computer.  There is not person who I've showed this to who can come up with any plausible explanation for what I saw and recorded. The three orbs of light were moving Northeast and started very low - pretty close to some of the taller buildings.  As it moved across the sky (in a pretty slow and stable pace) it began to rise in elevation before hovering for about 20 seconds almost directly above the building across the street from me.  As it hovered there the lights remained solid and then out of nowhere the 3 lights moved rapidly throughout that area of the sky - not side to side but in terms of elevation. It was hard to determine at first whether the three orbs were all one object or if they were in fact three seperate crafts.   After watching the orbs move as they did here, both in unison and independant paths, it was clear that this was one entity.  It then descended at an extremely rapid pace and then just vanished.   I immediately fell to the ground with tears streaming out of my eyes.  I knew what I had just witnessed and was overwhlem with shock, happiness, confimation, fear, confusion, etc.  I've always known that other life existed and that UFOs regularly visit the Earth, but I never in a million years thought I would be lucky enough to witness such an encounter, let alone capture it on video.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

After holiday while I and my wife viewing photos we found an Unidentified object and it was flying above.   We didn't detect it with naked eyes when we were visiting WTC.  I don't belive that US Goverment lets an ordinary vechile to fly above WTC.  Maybe this is an undetected vechile or it was a made in USA UFO. In photo 1 there are colorful circles.  In Photo 2 that circles are replacing and an UFO appears suddenly.  In photo 3 there is no light no UFO.  I want professionals to analyze the images and I am so curious about results.  I was not a believer but I was ready to believe.  Now I want to believe!;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
My boyfriend and I saw two V-shaped objects flying slowly with no sound in Brooklyn, NY.  ((anonymous report));2016-08-11 21:20:00;6 minutes;My boyfriend and I saw two V-shaped objects flying slowly with no sound in Brooklyn, NY. My boyfriend and I were walking our dog, when I noticed two orange glowing lights in the distance, near the Verrazano Bridge, in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn.  I thought maybe it was just planes, or a space station or a star, but we realized it was moving.   The objects were far too close together to be planes, and they moved too slowly for that.  I live right by a flight path, so I've seen countless planes at night and this wasn't it. At one point, the lights blinked out and came back on again.  As it flew over us, we didn't hear anything, which is unusual.  I often hear planes flying over my house, but it was quiet.  It wasn't in the shape of any plane I've ever seen--it was a V, like a flying triangle.  Both objects slowly passed over us, and slowly flew on. I don't know what it was, but it was creepy.

Silent, triangular craft over Brooklyn, NY.;2017-11-28 20:45:00;<1 minute;Silent, triangular craft over Brooklyn, NY. At approximately 8:45pm (20:45) on Tuesday 11/28/17, I stepped onto the back porch of a house in Brooklyn for some air (7th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues).  My girlfriend and I were visiting the location however, I was by myself when I stepped outside. I witnessed a silent triangular craft fly over.  It was heading in a generally northerly direction, at an angle roughly perpendicular to the way the houses sit. There were multiple lights lining the sides, but not the rear of the craft.  As such, it appeared to be a triangular craft, which could also look like a boomerang. This is my eighth sighting report to NUFORC:  2/6/97:  Mesa, AZ 4/26/09:  Brooklyn, NY 5/14/11:  Brooklyn, NY 7/10/11:  Brooklyn, NY 7/26/11:  Eastern U.S. skies 7/30/12:  Brooklyn, NY 8/21/13:  Brooklyn, NY 11/28/17:  Brooklyn, NY;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
