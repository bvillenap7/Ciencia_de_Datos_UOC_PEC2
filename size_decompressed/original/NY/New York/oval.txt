Bright  light over Sun Set Park, viewed from Park Slope on Fifth Avenue, Brooklyn  500 Lights On Object0: Yes;1985-06-15 23:00:00;1 minute;Bright  light over Sun Set Park, viewed from Park Slope on Fifth Avenue, Brooklyn   I would walk my dog around 11pm every night. This night I noticed a very bright streetlight in the distance. I thought to my self that the light was going to burn out in moment because it was too bright. But instead it started to rise straight up in the air. At a distance of several hundred feet in the air, the oval object turned from bright white to bluish / green color and then despaired in front of my eyes. Just before it despaired I noticed some detailed lines around the object.  Feeling that I saw something exstordinary, I went home and called Kenny Airport and asked them if they had anything unusual on the radar screens. They told me that they could not give that information out. So I told them I wanted to report a UFO.  They did give me a phone number in Washington, DC to call. The next day I called that number and a Commando answered the phone and told me there usually is no activity in the North East reported, and that most of the activity is in the South West. He made me feel like no one really cares, and my report will not make a difference. He took my number and told me he would check in to it. Well the Commando did call me back and told me that there where no reports made.  Years later, finding out about peoples abductions, I came to mind that the object that I witnessed the night was extremely low to the roof tops, which could of meant that I witnessed an abduction. Wanting closure for myself and maybe someone else who might need to hear my report, I decided to finally make my report.  I heard about your reporting center on a documentary UFOs Seeing is Believing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
above-city sighting of oval-shaped U.F.O. during meteor shower;1987-07-21 23:00:00;60 Minutes;above-city sighting of oval-shaped U.F.O. during meteor shower Please confirm the date entered above is the second to last Tuesday in the month of July. I was on the roof of my mother's apartment building, located in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. That's right, Brooklyn, New York just a few miles outside of the Big Apple itself. If memory serves, I believe I was locked out of our top floor apartment, having misplaced my keys. So I had to wait for my mother to return from having dinner with my father from Chinatown on the roof of my mother's tenement building. I recall it being a very nice night, kind of on the cool side, with low clouds at approximately 5,000 to 7,000 feet of altitude. Aside from the low, scattered clouds, the night sky was clear as a bell, and much of the stars were highly visible that night. What particularly had my utmost attention that night, was the elevated degree of meteorological activity that was taking place. Okay, so here I go. I witnessed an unusually low-flying shooting star decend toward the east, when to my amazement I noticed, just a second (or two) later, a oval-shaped object emitting a soft-white glow behind it as if it were in pursuit. In the next few minutes (perhaps for as much as the next 15-30 minutes or so) there were quite a number more of low-flying meteorites. One was of sufficient size, or perhaps it streaked low enough that I could actually hear it wisking through the atmosphere. The sound was brief, lasting approximately a second or so. From different directions in the night sky, I observed the same unidentified oval-shaped object fly in pursuit of several falling meteorites. By the time much of this increased meteorolgical activity was over, my mother had returned. I called her and told her to come up to the roof quickly. I then told her what I had been seeing, upon which she stayed with me for a while to gain the chance of possibly witnessing what I had seen for herself. Within a few minutes, another meteorite streaked in the distance to the east, after which both my mother and I witnessed the U.F.O. in pursuit. Before the U.F.O. disappeared and ended its low altitude airshow, it flew towards both my mom and I on our left as we faced east. (Something makes me recall there being two this time, but I can not recall for sure.) It flew level and then took a 30 to 45 degree ascent into a cloud bank and disappeared for what I thought was for good. Later on that evening, at approximately 00:30 hours, my brother had come up to the roof after having heard what was going on to catch a glimpse and mostly to poke fun. He was with me, when we both witnessed a distant point-of-light, that caught our eyes. From its distance and apparent height, it could have been a plane at high altitude or a star by appearance. Except, this star started moving irregularly across the sky and changed its relative position by a great distance. It is my belief that this object was very high up in the sky or possibly even outside our planet's atmosphere. My brother dismissed what we both saw as OUR eyes playing tricks on us. On some level, I wish I could have done the same. I am glad for my mother having witnessed the U.F.O. flying at low altitude with me, as I needed someone to affirm that I was actually witnessing these crafts, right here, above the metropolis of New York. I wish I could estimate the size of the craft to some degree of accuracy. In the night sky and at a distance, it is a bit difficult to get an idea as to an object's relative size without some common frame of reference. What I can say is that the U.F.O. conducted manuvuers that only a fighter jet would be capable of performing. Its movements were swift and precise, but not necessarily beyond the means of a fighter jet. However, the U.F.O. performed all of the above flying activity at what appeared to be supersonic speeds. Not only did I not hear a sonic boom, I did not hear the craft produce an audible sound of any kind. Nor did I notice even a neglible loss of speed when it finally made its ascent into the cloud bank from which it did not reappear.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
YONKERS, NY;1988-03-17 19:30:00;45 min to 1 hr;It was about 7:30pm, the date really escapes me at the moment, I was 15 years old and headed out to my friend's house near Lake Ave. in Yonkers, NY. I lived near Central Ave. and Tuckahoe Rd..  My mom walked me out to throw the trash when we saw my neighbor from accross the street and his dog just standing there looking up at the sky.  When we got to the end of the driveway we saw this ENORMOUS craft hovering silently in the sky.  This object was atleast the size of an aircraft carrier and about 7 or 8 stories tall and the sky was crystal clear.  It was lighted but the lights were strange and flashed in a pattern that made them appear as though they wer circling the craft.  It was mettalic like a brushed aluminum or stainless steel with a very low gloss finish. We just stood there in aw when my mom suggested that I run accross the street to my uncle's house for a camera.  My uncle always had a loaded camera on hand and he had offered to drive me to my friend's house.  When I arrived at his house I yelled up to his window and told him whatr we were looking at.  Being my uncle he did not pay any attention to me and assumed that I was trying to rush him to give me a lift.  As I pleaded for the camera the object began to move slowly SW.  Not wanting to loose sight of it I ran back to the position my mom and my neighbor were at and climbed a tree as the craft began to move beyond our sight.  I watched as it moved past some apartment buildings located on Palmer Rd. and noted that it was lower that the buildings which would put it at about 50-75 yards in the air since the buildings sit on a hill. I kept an eye on it until it disapeared behind the tree-line still moving SW. O.K. this is where it should end right?  Well, my uncle finally comes out with the camera and asks what all the xciment was about...I told him as we drove across Tuckahoe Rd. and eventually up Lake Ave. from Saw Mill River Rd..  Just as we approached Lake there were people stopped and getting out of their cars looking toward the sky.  We of course stopped and saw a series of green lights in a formation very much shaped like a kite.  As these lights passed overhead we could hear humming. As I explained that this was not what I had seen a few minutes earlier the lights reappeared and seemed to be circling over the city.  When I arrived at my friend's house we snapped a photo of these lights with a crappy poliroid,  (they circled for about an hour), and then being a not-unintelligent child,  I ran into my friend's house and called the operator for the FBI's #..LOL… The kicker is that I actually got to talk to someone in some office of the FBI who put me on hold for a min. or two and returned, telling me that there were marines choppers on manuvers over Yonkers that night.  I insisted that perhaps the green lights were marines but that the first object was certainly not.  They of course blew me off and said they had no further info.  What the heck were marine's flying over Yonkers when the closest base at the time was 1.5 hours away in NJ??? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
i know what i saw;1994-08-07 22:00:00;several minutes;i know what i saw It was a dark night because there was no moon. A friend and myself were walking to her house around 10.pm from the house of another friend.  We turned down a side street and thought we saw a plane flying very low we moved into the middle of the street to get a better look.  we thought this was a plane because we saw lights (lights like that were pretty visible then because alot of the sidestreets had only 2 or so streetlights on them so there was alot of dark areas).  we stopped walking, looked at each other and remarked to each other about how low that plane was flying, and how something must be wrong for them to be so low.  we spoke for what had to be less than a minute or two. as we looked back up the lights were almost directly above us and hovering.  it was oval shaped, black i think, with 3 lights in a semicircular shape, there were 2 sets and 2 rows of these lights facing each other.  they were so bright.  they were just so bright it seemed unreal.  It must have been about the size of a large oval pool.  i think that is what shocked us the most.  that what we thought was a plane was so small and so quietand that while it was  hovering it was sort of dipping from side to side kind of like a small boat on choppy water, not like it was going to flip over or anything i don't think.  just like choppy water movement.  my friend and i looked at each other again for what seemed like an hour,  and ran in different directions.  we finally caught up with each other, and made it to her house. no one believed us.  even now, today no one believes me.  i don't speak to that particular girl very much anymore we both went different ways in life.  but any time i see her we both end up talking about it.  we know what we saw.

At the corner of 10th Avenue and 57th Street I saw two gray elliptical objects coming from the New Jersey side of the river. The objects were traveling very fast and they were silent.  They hovered over my head for a few seconds and I could see lights in the underside of the objects then they just disappeared before my eyes.  It was a beautiful clear day, not a cloud or airplane in the sky. When I got to work I discussed my sighting with a co worker who researches UFO’s.  He showed me some pictures of UFO’s and those pictures looked exactly like the objects I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

I asked him what was up and he replied your going to think im hallucinating and asked me to take a look at these silvery objects which he was looking at. When I looked up towards the north sky I've seen a multitude of shiny oval objects moving in formations. Now this was a clear day in broad daylight in a Brooklyn New York area so i was amazed. These were true UFO'S  flying at an approximate hight over 25000 feet and in perfect formation. Soon others were flying into the so called formation. The entire time was around 15 to 20 minutes. It was the most spectacular thing i have ever seen. When these object move out it was as if the were sucked into a vacuum, now your see them now you dont. Everyone i told looked at me as if i were nuts but i had another person and he was the one to point these out to me. The thing i find most interesting is the next day I saw a camaflouged highwing army plane possible a Cessna flying a circular pattern the whole day afterwards.I work for Verizon as an otside plant technition and follow aviation as a hobby.

small black oval, moving extremely slowly in broad daylight, about 6 or 7 stories off ground;2001-03-01 10:00:00;5 minutes;small black oval, moving extremely slowly in broad daylight, about 6 or 7 stories off ground When I looked out of my window, in the morning - sun shining on the top of the building across the street, I noticed what I thought was a black plastic bag floating over a six-story building.  But then I noticed it was moving very very slowly, and it wasn't being whipped around.  It was hovering over the building about 6 feet or so, and ever so slowly moving north, staying the exact same distace up in the air.  Then I also noticed that there was no reflection coming off of it, which was also strange, since the sun was shining right on it.  And it was jet-black.  It continued along the top of those two building, and then went across a rather large football field - all the while moving extremely slowly and at the same height off the ground - never once being whipped by the wind or changing its oval shape.  I watch it for some time as it went into the distance.  To this day I can't think of any know object that fits that description.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Both were white in color and oval in shape. They were traveling in a west to east direction and at a very rapid speed, since they were out of sight within 10 seconds or less. The unuseual part of this sighting is that the very next day (04/29/01), I was on my roof with binoculars watching the commerical aircraft.

The object on the right was steady, but the object of the left was moving form right to left and back to front of the other. As I mentioned, both were perfectly oval and white in color. On this same day I later went onto my roof with binoculars to follow air traffic of commerical flights that pass over my house going to Laguardia airport. While watching the sky I suddenly spotted which seemed to be the same objects I had noticed earlier that day. Both were oval and white in color, but this time both were fling side by side and steady.

On July 27,2001 I saw lights that outlined a large oval from which three other bright white lights detached and flew away. from;2001-07-27 02:55:00;approximately one hour;On July 27,2001 I saw lights that outlined a large oval from which three other bright white lights detached and flew away. from I was locking the doors and putting out the lights on my roof terrace which overlooks New Jersey and the Hudson River. It was a beautiful night with small clouds and patches of sky in between.  There was an oval of diffused white light which appeared to be coming from behind the clouds.  Only th outline or the rim of the object was illuminated. It seemed as if it were over New Jersey, but I could not see any beams of light coming up from the ground. I moved away from the door and windows to turn out the terrace lights--literally an instant--and when I looked again it was gone.  I watched the sky for a couple of minutes and all of a sudden I could see it again.  It appeared as if it switched the lights on and off and had been there all the time.  It had just not been illuminated which is why I could not see it.When the lights came on again, they started off a soft lavender color and then went to pink and possibly green.  Again very diffused soft colors.  Photographs I have seen of the aurora borealis came to mind.  But this light was stationery.  No movement  The first time this light turned off was 3:04 in the morning. I believe it turned off once or twice again. I believe that one time it turned off when a helicopter went down the Hudson River.  After the helicopter was out of sight three balls of light (one at each end of the oval and one in the middle) flew away from the central light and instantly disappeared. They flew faster then any plane  I have ever seen.  I believe this happened at least three times.  The closest visual analogy I could make is the huge craft that the scientists played the music for in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  As a matter of fact this object looked exactly the same.  My friend was sleeping soundly during this so I called WCBS and ABC (whose studios overlook the same  part of New Jersey as I do ). I wanted to see if anyone else had phoned in after seeing this.  The people at both numbers were polite but obviously didn't believe me.  At 3AM I'm sure that many of th! eir call s are from people who are far from sober.  My friend heard me on the phone and woke up.  I excitedly told him what had happened, but since there was nothing in the sky now he had difficulty understanding what I was talking about.  However, as we were watching the sky, I saw a faint light, then two.  Once I brought them to his attention, he could see them, but since he hadn't seen the entire object as I had, they didn't mean much to him.  As I noticed a third light appearing, they suddenly flew off whoosh into the skies behind us. That he saw.  He couldn't figure out any logical explanation either nor could I.  I am aware that people in Virginia and some of the other southeastern states had seen something which was described as a fireball in the week prior to my experience.  What I saw was nothing like a fireball.  It was almost as if someone were projecting a slide from Close Encounters onto the clouds. I am retired, although I am only 55 years old.  I was the president of a company which  manufactured women's clothing. The most unusual thing I have ever seen in the sky was what I believe was a fireball over the Pacific off Tahiti.  The reason it was described as a fireball was that it looked like a bright meteor travelling horizontally.  What I saw over New Jersey was not a natural phenomena.  It was perfectly shaped and would appear and disappear as if someone were flipping a switch. I am terribly interested in knowing if anyone else saw this that night.  There are millions of people in New York.  Granted few are looking at the sky at 3AM, but someone had to see this.  It was huge.  I would also like to know about other sightings of objects similar to this. In the space for number of craft seen, I answered four.  I decided on this figure because I saw one huge craft and no more than three others at any one time.  However because three craft flew off at least three times, I have no way of knowing if they were different craft each time.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPLY ON THE WEB SITE ((name deleted)) FROM ROME - ITALY ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at many videos and still photos of the WTC attack, and we believe that none of the allegedly anomalous objects appears to us to be UFO-related.  The tiny white object seen above Tower 1 at the time of the first impact appears to us to be a helicopter on the near side of the tower and resultant fireball, flying from left to right.  The fuzzy, indistinct object seen just to the right of the fireball erupting from Tower 2 (southern tower) is more difficult to ascribe to anything we are familiar with, but our suspicion is that the object(s) may be the engine(s) from UAL Flight 175/Boeing 767 which, because of their mass, penetrated through the building well ahead of the fireball and other parts of the aircraft.  We express our profound sympathy to the many thousands of individuals whose loved ones perished in this tragedy.

Blue Orb;2004-02-14 20:00:00;2 seconds;While on Sand Lane in the Staten Island South Beach area, about 7:30 PM I saw a glowing blue Orb shoot down across the Verrazzanno Bridge. It happened very fast, and it was even luminous against the very bright bridge lights. It was unmistakable. No one in the area semeed to have seen it, so I forgot about it. That was until I saw that others in NY had seen it too. I think it may have been shooting towards Fort Wadsworth, where there has been UFO sightings before. I feel that whole area under Fort Wadsworth is hollow, going back to the 1700's and DoD, Army, Coast Guard etc all have bases there. I think these orbs are energy fields, enabling these crafts to cheat normal physics. I wanted others to know what they saw was real.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Mind Controlled by Aliens;2004-07-12 23:00:00;1-2 hours;Mind Controlled by Aliens One day I was driving home from work. I spotted a light following my car. My dog in the back seat was barking and then the light suddenly stopped and the dog stopped barking. I tried to get out of my car but the door wouldn't open. The car then suddenly shut off and I felt paralized. The light came towards me and I could only blink. They talked to me through telepathic waves and could read my mind. There was about three of them and they took me to there ship, I could only see them as shadows. Thats all I can remember but I woke up two days later in my car and I now have a scar on the back of my neck in a checker formation.

the hazy white four objects traveled in a circle and came together about a dozen times in the center like they were playing a game.;2004-08-20 22:00:00;15 min.;the hazy white four objects traveled in a circle and came together about a dozen times in the center like they were playing a game. I was traveling on Hylan Blvd. south in the vicinity of Wolf's Pond when I sited four white objects which took on an appearance of the light that a new restaurant or club projects into the sky to advertise the grand opening but the size was larger in shape and hazy white looking because of the hazy evening.  They were traveling approximately 40 mph and were traveling southeast.  They appeared to be playing a game like ring around the roseo.  They would come together in the center, touch, and then go back out again.  They continued to travel separately, in a circle and then come together and touch, and then go back out.  They did this approximately 10, maybe a dozen times.  I followed them for as long as I could, about a mile or so until the end of the road.  It is pretty deserted out there, only a few houses.  They continued and I loss sight of them.  There was a car at the end of the road before me on a cell phone, and another car that stopped that was behind me.  I did not communicate with them but I got the impression that they may have saw what I saw.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Brilliant white orbs, similiar to stars, in the sky over Queens, New York.;2007-05-06 15:30:00;45 mins;Brilliant white orbs, similiar to stars, in the sky over Queens, New York. This sighting happened at 2:30 in the afternoon in a brilliant blue sky.  I was walking along Queens blvd.  and noticed a man walking towards me and staring directly upward toward the sky.  This seemed odd to me because the man was transfixed on what he was looking at.  Ofcourse this peeked my interest, so I looked at what he was staring at too.  At first I did not see what he was looking at, but then the object caught my eye.  There was not a cloud in the sky. Im not sure if it was supposed to be a full moon that night, but the moon , atleast 80% full was out at 2:30 in the afternoon.  I just so happened to be wearing sunglasses.  If I hadn't had them on I wouldn't have been able to see this oval shaped ufo.  It was a brilliant white orb about as high in the sky as a visible planet or north star. Both of which I thought this to be.  Just as I was about to continue my walk and right this off as a star, it moved.  It moved left to right a very short distance.  I couldn't have been a plane.  It couldn't have been a helicoper. It couldn't have been a balloon.  I stood there and tried to convince myself that this was something that I could explain easily.  And then from the Northwest came from nowhere, three more.  Directly north of the first object came two more.  In total there were six.  All the same size color, shape and brightness.  Now I was freaked.  What the hell was I looking at?  It was such a bright, sunny day that I could't get anyone else to stop and witness what I was looking at.   The man that originally was the reason I stopped in the first place had gone.  The objects that came from the northwest moved slowly towards the first object almost forming a triangle formation.  The two from the north were just slowly downward almost as if they were on strings.  Almost as quickly as they appeared, five of them vanished upward as if pulled straight up on strings.  The original orb never left the sky.  I stood there for about 45 mins and then headed home.  When all six orbs were in ! the sky at the same time, they reminded me of what skydivers falling together to make a formation might look like.  The only problem is that these objects never fell to earth as skydivers must eventually do.   So there you have it, my first ufo sighting.  Its official.  I am the most skeptical person I know.  Im one of those see it to believe it people.  Now i've seen it.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

At first i thought it was a shadow or something but when i saw the planes,and traffic hellicopters flying near it,i knew it was not a shadow. At one point it looked like it changed shape from a circle to a shape of a top hat. I tried to figure out the size of it as i saw a few jet planes flying in its direction you could fit at least 3 of those jets together just for the width,and it would not cover the whole thing.After about 8 minutes of whatching this, the black mass started to move away,and this time at a steady flow forward heading west into the sky line.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

There were very few meteors that we saw, but still enough dazzle us.   When sitting, I saw an oblate circle/oval shaped object fly by.  I looked at it, and I was about to neglect the continuation of looking at it since I thought it was a bird or airplane or something.  Then, I realized it was moving at incredilble speed.  About five times faster than a normal plane would make at that elevation.  It was an orangish color (around the color of the clouds) with no lights or sound.  It moved very fast and smooth and my brother and I had to stand up to see it as it was about to go past our field of vision.  We watched it disappear into the clouds.  It headed around the direction of South.  It moved in a straight path.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

It was Sunday at @2:30 AM.  The noise is what woke us up it sounded like an earthquake and a jet,the house shook, I thought that perhaps my central air condition unit was on the blink, so I went outside to check. This was what I saw.  A large oval object in the dark sky,  almost like a standard blimp but much bigger and had no bottom basket as on a blimp. Color silver grey, metalic. Red lights on right and left side of object, and beams on white lights very powerful from the middle of object.  The white beams of lights were flashing. The flashing lights like those of pictures being taken, flashed in my face and I got scared and went inside and got my husband.  I purposly woke him up because otherwise if I told him what a saw at night he would think that I'm flipping out or something.  My husband looked at it and we both decided to go inside the house.  We could not sleep for the rest of the night.   I was very nervous, I told my co-workers about what we saw,! and they were surprised that I did not take pictures, or call 311.  I guess I should off but I was so nervous at what I was looking at that I froze.   I'm sure someone else must of seen it.  My neighbors assume that perhaps they were making a movie and this was a movie event in the sky.  People are afraid to talk about this event.  Movie makers inform  in advance that a movie will be shot at what time and ask to move all cars. There was no such request,and movies would not make such noise at that time of night.   We watched from the house until it hovered away in what seemed an eternety.  No smoke, no exhaust, just noise and out.    I say it was a UFO.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

It looked like a flaming orange stingray.  For a moment I thought it was a plane on fire.  It continued on and finally disappeared behind a building. It seemed to be flying at the same speed as a regular airplane.  A few seconds later, I saw an orange globe flying from south to north.  This one did not rise up from the same spot as the first one.  It went over the building, and immediately after, another one followed.  These two were also flying at airplane speed.

Small grey/silver metallic object, mostly circular in shape seen hovering and moving slowly at high altitude over the Hudson River.;2014-05-25 12:00:00;4-5 minutes;small grey/silver metallic object, mostly circular in shape seen hovering and moving slowly at high altitude over the Hudson River While spending Memorial day weekend in the Long Island/NYC area, I visited the USS Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum.  The day was Sunday, May 25th, 2014.   After touring the top deck and interior I made my way down the stairs to the adjacent dock area.  There were already multiple news and tour helicopters making their way up the Hudson River, while a US Coast Guard MH-65 was performing a Search and Rescue Demo (for NY Fleet Week) over the waterfront so naturally I had my eyes towards the sky, at just after noon (anywhere between 12:00 and 12:30) I noticed a small object at high altitude over the Hudson.   At first I suspected it to be merely a balloon, however after examining the object for a few seconds I noticed it appeared to be considerably larger than a normal balloon and it was hovering in place as if not affected by the present winds which a balloon would be.  Its coloration was also interesting, it appeared to mostly be a metallic grey or silver on the! surface.  I pointed it out to my father who quickly dismissed it as probably being a balloon (although he said he couldn't see it very well).  I began snapping photos of the object with my IPhone 5. I estimated the objects altitude to be around 4,000-5,000 feet because it was a lot higher than the helicopters flying up the Hudson but much lower than the occasional passing commercial airliner out of JFK airport, I had no way of guessing the objects size due to its distance and lack of anything close enough to it to compare it with, though it did appear to be larger than a balloon.   After a few minutes the object began a slow flight path moving diagonally but remaining at the same altitude, I began backing up to keep the object in view while taking pictures but it soon passed over the deck of the Intrepid and out of sight.  Although I didn't run into any other witnesses I think it is unlikely that I was the only one who saw it due to the sheer number of people in the area.   Upon uploading and reviewing the photos on my computer the following day, I noticed several things that I didn't notice while viewing the object,  The first few pictures showed exactly what I saw, a small rounded shiny metallic object hovering.  However, as I looked through the pictures I noticed the object had a darker, shaded edge in some pictures giving it more of a definitive shape (this may have been due to the sun reflecting from the other side of the object) while in other photos the object appeared to be very bright and shiny.  One of the photos the object is completely dark except for a small ring of light in the center that appears to be generated by the object, the rest of the object appears much more like a structured craft here with less of a circular shape and two corners on one side.  The final photos show the object again to be metallic and silver with the upper half being brighter (almost a whitish blue) and the lower half being a darker grey, there are also several dark patches on the edges of the object.  I have always been intrigued by the UFO phenomenon but have mostly remained a skeptic however I am questioning it now.  All I can say is that while knowing a lot about aviation and can easily identify most airplanes or helicopters, this object I witnessed and photographed did not move like or resemble any normal aircraft that I have seen in my life.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Oval shaped solid object non illuminated hovering motionless approximately 2000 ft over the East River of Manhattan, NYC.;2016-06-21 00:00:00;8 minutes;Oval shaped solid object non illuminated hovering motionless approximately 2000 ft over the East River of Manhattan, NYC. I am 57 years old and a paralegal for an investment advisor firm in New York City.  I live in a studio apt on the top floor of a 4th Floor walk-up in the Kip’s Bay area on the East Side of Manhattan.  There is a balcony in the back of the apt that has a view facing the skyline looking out over the East River towards Queens and Brooklyn.   I often go out to the balcony on warm clear nights to look at the stars and get some fresh air.  I went out 2 nights ago, on June 21st, around midnight, when I spotted a strange object hovering over the East River.  It looked like a roundish, oval shape that was not illuminated except for the city lights shining up on it and the nearly full moon behind it.  It looked to be about  1/5th  the size of a normal full moon from where I was standing which was about 5 blocks from the East River.  The altitude was higher than the Empire State Building which stands west of my vantage point.  It looked to be at least as big as a house in my estimation. 	It was a clear night with just a few small puffy clouds still hanging in the sky near the object and I thought that maybe the object was just a small portion of a cloud but there was a breeze blowing North and the other clouds soon blew past the object and dissipated while the object remained in the same spot and hovered completely motionless.  At this point I thought I might have something out of the ordinary here so I ran back into my apartment and got my binoculars.  I steadied the binoculars against a balcony railing and managed to capture the object in my sights.  It looked oval shaped and had sort of a greenish, grayish color.  I could not discern any details such as windows or defining structure because it was difficult to keep in focus.  I thought I may have seen a few tiny pinpoint size colored lights but cannot be certain. 	After a few moments it began to slowly move north towards upper Manhattan and I could see stars passing behind it as it moved.  I could not hear any sound coming from it.  After moving north for a few hundred yards it changed direction and started heading due East over Long Island City in Queens.  I lost sight of it after a very tall tree in a neighboring yard blocked my view.  I waited for a half an hour to see if it would return but it never did.  The full sighting lasted about 8 mins.  									June 23, 2016;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Round grey object with no illumination emanating from it hovers over Brooklyn for 15 plus minutes without moving;2020-07-21 21:00:00;15 minutes;Round grey object with no illumination emanating from it hovers over Brooklyn for 15 plus minutes without moving I and a friend were approaching the sidewalk where an adult male and female observer both 20's/30's, were looking and pointing into the sky.  Initially I thought maybe they saw something in the tree, then jokingly I offered What is there a UFO or something?  The female observer responded, yea I think it is and I and my friend were easily able to make out the object they were looking at right away -- it was hard to miss, even in the night sky.  It was a gray oval/circle that did not appear illuminated such that a star, planet or terrestrial aircraft would be (or what I'd imagine a UFO would be) and it was stationary.  It also did not appear that high up, almost as if you could reach out and pluck it from the sky.  We wondered whether it was a balloon or a drone, but it did not move in a way that would suggest that and both observers we encountered confirmed it has been stationary for about ten minutes and they stayed looking at it wond! ering if it would move.  The object appeared solid, almost as if it could be made of dark grey metal.  To my observation it seemed to wobble somewhat as if ever so slightly hovering, but gave the impression of being stationary.  It was clear sky with no clouds and there were a few stars that could be made out to give a basis of comparison.  We stayed for about five minutes staring until my friend became spooked and we then walked around the corner to my apartment.  We came back to the same spot 30 minutes later and it was gone and the sky was still clear.  No sounds or lights emanated from the object, it appeared to be visible due to illumination from city light pollution.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
