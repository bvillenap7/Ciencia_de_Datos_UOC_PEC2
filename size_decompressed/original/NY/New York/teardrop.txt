BRIGHT WHITE  LIGHTS SEEN IN THE BRONX IN THE 1980's.;1984-09-20 21:00:00;5 minutes;BRIGHT WHITE  LIGHTS SEEN IN THE BRONX IN THE 1980's. I was around 17 years old at the time, walking home down 153 street between Courtlandt Avenue and Morris Ave. with chinese takeout food.  It was around 9:00pm and the sky was pretty clear.  From the corner of my right eye up on the sky I spotted some lights. At first because the lights were so bright, I thought it was some kind of fireworks, but the lights never disolved. Instead the object moved silently from north to south. My building where I lived is 14 stories tall, and the object seemed it was about triple the height of the building.  The large object had about 9 lights, 5 in the front almost in a octigon shape and the about 4 lights tailing it.  All the lights moved as if the object was one. I got the impression it was one object. I was amazed, something that large, that close didn't make any noise what so ever. I have seen blimps in the past, and you could hear them.  This was no blimp. Also, a few months later, I saw on TV a home video that someone took showing  the same craft I witnessed.

Manhattan UFO;1992-09-12 22:15:00;5 minutes;Manhattan UFO It was a cloudless night with a big moon (cannot remember how full).  My brother and I were people watching in the apartments around Hell's Kitchen (mid-town on west side).  The object came over the apartment building and stayed there motionless.  It clearly had no markings and was featureless except for a band of orange lights that pulsated from yellow to orange.  After hovering for nearly five minutes it began to climb until it disappeared.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
white glowing craft with little blue dot chasing it;2001-11-02 22:30:00;4 minutes;white glowing craft with little blue dot chasing it i was in a park in brooklyn, i noticed that the sky looked like it was moving becuz the clouds were being blown by the wind. from behind the clouds i noticed a white glowing sort of teardrop shaped craft, behind it, tailin it was a little blue dot. It seemed to be attached or being pulled by a blue glowing beem. It was moving pretty fast , but it seemed to circle the whole park which is at least 4miles in diameter.  then it just left   it made no sound at all.....;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
teardrop shaped craft with 3 steady lights underneath;2003-08-28 23:00:00;1-2 minutes;teardrop shaped craft with 3 steady lights underneath I was in my friend's bedroom about 11 p.m. when we heard a loud whirling sound(not too loud, maybe as loud as an airplane).  The sound was unlike any we had ever heard. It was a whirling sound almost like the sound of air vibrating when you are spinning something very fast.  I saw three steady lights through the blinds in her window.  I looked out the window and saw a white air craft that was narrow on one end and got wider towards the other end, kind of like a teardrop.  On the bottom of the craft were 3 steady lights in a triangular shape.  They didn't blink or change color or anything like that.  The sides of it appeared to be blue.  It was kind of hovering outside the window and then started moving slowly to the right.  I Only looked at it for a few seconds and told my friend that it was a blimp.  She didn't believe that it was a blimp because of the sound she heard.  She looked out the window about two seconds after I moved away from it and she couldn't see it but we still heard it.  She immediatley ran outside hoping to get a glimpse of it but it was no where in sight even though she could still here it.  I don't know what I saw.  But I do know that it was not an airplane because it did not have any wings, it was not a helicopter because there were no propellers and nothing underneath the craft other than the lights on its bottom. And we figure that it was not a blimp because as I said there was nothing underneath it other than the lights and blimps do not advertise at 11p.m. Also the sound was not like that of a helicopter or airplane.  I know what airplanes sound like I live near the airport, and this was no airplane.  I'd like to know if anyone else has seen this or has some other explanation.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Whining cross between quiet helicopter and blimp seen sailing low going southwest over Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY;2005-09-20 23:45:00;10 minutes;Whining cross between quiet helicopter and blimp seen sailing low going southwest over Park Slope, Brooklyn, NY At 11:45, 9/20/05, I was watching television when I heard something like a gong or church bell. It seemed too late for churchbells. I looked out the window and saw what I thought was a blimp. But it was making a whining sound by now, and it was too close/low overhead to be blimp (lower than any plane) and too small to be a blimp. I was looking out from a high floor on a building on Prospect Park West and 10th Street in Brooklyn. The UFO sailed by in a southwest direction, over Prospect Park. Now it looked to me like a cross between a small blimp and some kind of quiet helicopter--it was still making a whining sound, but MUCH quieter and nothing like the sound of a helicopter.  I decribed it over the phone to 911 while watching it go further southwest, over Midwood, Coney Island (approximately) and I guess out to sea (I could see the blinking lights far away).  911 hung up on me. I called 311 and asked how to report a UFO. They said it was outside their jurisdiction. I called the FBI. The FBI said to call the FAA. I could not get working number for the FAA from information.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

It was mat black and moved very slow West towards the Hudson River;2007-10-15 18:00:00;10 minutes;It was mat black and moved very slow West towards the Hudson River I was walking South on 7th Ave and when I approached 16th Street I noticed the craft moving West over the tops of buildings down 14th Street.  It stood out because of how slow it was moving and very level.  The shape was sort of tear dropped but flat on the bottom. I would say it was about the size of a helicopter without a tail. The color was a mat black and I could not tell if it had any windows. It seemed to be about 100 feet above the tallest of the buildings on that block which is about 20 stories. The weather was clear and it was easy to see a great distance. Since it was moving so slow I really tried to see if there were props like a helicopter and there was nothing. I pointed it out to two people and they said it looked bizarre, they could not tell what it was either. They walked away not seeming too interested in fact, no one seemed to care about it or  notice it. It continued over the buildings and out over the Hudson River and then just slowly ascended upwards. Before it was over the Hudson I watched it's level in relation to the buildings and as far as I could tell it was moving in a straight line until it was out over the river.

Possible NYC UFO Upper West Side, two sightings separated by four hours.;2017-04-18 14:30:00;4 hours;Possible NYC UFO Upper West Side, two sightings separated by four hours At around 14:30 I saw a silver object that looked like a balloon.  It floated West, across Amsterdam Avenue and about 65th Street in NYC.  It floated in the West/North West direction, out towards the Hudson River. At around 18:31 pm I was walking South on Riverside Drive, at around 71st Street, when I noticed a group of these same “balloons” floating West towards the Hudson River.  They looked like balloons, but they also looked like UFOs.  They were coming from a completely different direction and time than the one I had previously seen. There were approximately four UFOs in this small group.  As they ascended, they all moved at the same speed towards the sun, making it hard to see them.  One of the objects didn’t float in formation.  It proceeded to move swiftly, heading North, before banking and heading South, now above the Hudson River.  It did this a few times, changing direction smoothly.  At the same time, it seemed to move in the general direction of the other objects. If they were a lot closer, I imagine they would have been relatively large balloons. The objects were silver, and, if they WERE aircraft, I imagine they were small…smaller than a car.  If they were balloons, they were large balloons. The part that REALLY drew my attention was the time difference between the two sightings.  There is no way that the one balloon I saw, descended to the earth, found three more balloons like it, then proceeded to ascend back on its course, four hours after the first sighting. Maybe there was an event in NYC, where a lot of silver balloons were let off…it was strange.  I have some video of the two events. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite eloquent and serious-minded.  We suspect that he is a highly reliable witness.
