FireBall in the Bronx...... Early 80s;1983-07-10 20:00:00;5 seconds;FireBall in the Bronx...... Early 80s It happen so long ago in the early eighties i'm not too sure about the year or day... but I'll never forget what I saw.  One of my friends had some girl cousins that came over for the summer.  We really didnt have many girls on my block so we decided to make the best of it and play a game called catch & kisses.  On my block was a school CS 77 and we were all in the school yard chasing each other... well as I was being chased or chasing one of the girls from the small yard where your closed in (the school is a U shape and the small yard is in the U) into the big yard were it's out in the open... I  saw what appeared to be a huge fire ball.  I remember a few of us kids stopped dead in our tracks.   I was coming out the small yard which was on the Manor Ave side of the school and I was Running into the big yard  which allowed you to look from Manor ave to Ward Ave.  I was facing Ward Ave which was west and saw the fire ball coming from that direction.  It appeared to fly right above us.  It seemed to be flying really low.  You could hear this fire ball.  It sounded.... well like what you would expect a fireball to sound like... i guess..... I've never heard anything like that before.   And you could almost feel this thing as it passed over us.  It flew right over us east bound,  but once it pass over it disappeared from our sights because of a 6 story building on the corner of 172nd St. and Manor ave. We all started running around tripping out and asking each other if we saw the same thing.  Oddly enough we really didnt make a big deal about it.... we all thought it was a meteor or comet.... and every couple of years it would be talked about as a weird unexplainable occurance. It wasnt until I got older that i started thinking UFO. This fire ball was or appeared to be flying really low... so low that a building only 6 stories block our view immediatly after it passed over us.  Also, this thing should have crashed.... exploded or somthing. there is no way somthing that was close enough to hear and feel.... like you feel when a plane is flying low..... didnt impact. and if it was a comet or somthing.... wouldnt the news report such a thing?  This is NYC!  Somthing like that doesn't go unreported!;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

We looked up and saw a fireball streak across the entire sky, which was visible to us, in about 4-5 seconds. Extremely fast, no sound. The front appeard to be a reddish color and the tail was white. We could see much of the sky so it was fascinating that any craft could cross our entire field of vision so fast. There was only one object. Streaked exremely fast across entire sky.

It then dropped into the river, and its glow could still be seen after the object was under the water The object was aprox. 4 mi distant horizontally. Vertical distance unknown, but below cloud level. From vantage point, about the size of a marble.

Metallic Ball on Fire No Trails Enters Cloud But Does Not Exit Cloud;2002-06-01 19:00:00;30 seconds;Metallic Ball on Fire No Trails Enters Cloud But Does Not Exit Cloud I was at a small bar-b-q party on a rooftop 10th floor when the sun was beginning to set. I was standing facing north by northwest, minimal cloud cover (cumulous clouds). I was watching a plane (737 most likely) traveling west in the sky may have taken off from La Guardia or JFK airport and was making its accent but everything was smooth and the plane was approaching cloud level.  I was noticing the speed the plane appeared to be traveling and the direction as well as the cloud the plane was approaching. From overhead, about the same altitude of the cloud was a ball of fire but no trails as it traveled, just a ball of fire about 4 times the size of the plane, traveling about 5-6 times the speed of the plane.  The ball appeared to be metallic and made no sound.  This ball entered into the cloud about 1 mile ahead of the plane and did not come out the other side.  The plane entered the same cloud and passed through as if nothing happened.  I was amazed at what I had seen because I’ve never seen anything like that but what was truly the greatest part of the experience was when I looked over my left shoulder someone else had been watching the same thing and was shocked also by what they had seen.  We talked about it for a few seconds and keep in touch one in a blue moon but together we had witnessed something on our own.  We know this was not a commet or meteor, it had no trails.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

huge blue shooting star;2004-02-14 19:30:00;5 sec;huge blue shooting star I had just arrived in NY from Paris.I was on avenue of the americas, and near greenwich village.I was looking at my left, and  in the perspective of a perpendicular street at my left, i saw a HUGE blue light, as if it was a shooting star but maybe 100 times bigger. And it went down as quickly as a shooting star and disappeared at about  2 o'clock (i don't know if that mesure exist in english).It was super big and super fast. After that, i looked carefully at the planes to check with their size but their is nothing in common between them.This object was either very close which seems impossible, or huge.Even if close, i would still say it was a supersize light. ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS)) Hello Peter,  i'm very glad you answered my report. I have waited two weeks back in Paris, since i came back from New York, and then i remembered i had to check on a UFO site if something was reported that day , the 14th of feb, because i expected a lot of people to have seen it.And what was my surprise when i saw the other reports on your site!Reassuring in a way...(your site is very well done in terms of ergonomy by the way) So, for more info, i thought i would be better if I send you the global aspect of this light as a drawing on one of my pictures taken back then.  Also , according to me it was rather blue, a pale blue very luminescent, hazy on the edges, the size of the moon maybe? a bit bigger.It had the kind of move and way of disapearing as a shooting star, very fast.  It didn't seem to burn , though, and the speed of it was really astonishing. I cannot say which was the direction,but i remember I was looking at the left, and going down manhattan.  I was walking with a friend, she didn't see it.But immediately i thought this had nothing in common with anything i've seen in the sky so far.   Did any newspaper talked anout it?Or anyone took a picture? I would like to know the clue of this light.  Best luck for your research Keep me informed please,  regards  ((name deleted)) ((END));40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Fireball flashed and streaked across the Manhattan sky northward and disappeared in a little over a second;2004-06-27 21:45:00;1+ seconds;Fireball flashed and streaked across the Manhattan sky northward and disappeared in a little over a second I was walking out of a movie theatre on 13th street and Broadway at approximately 9:45 PM.  Broadway runs northwest and southeast.  I was looking up into the sky northward, I saw a flash and what looked like a fireball appeared.  It seemed to flash into view suddenly.  It was predominantly red with white, maybe yellow intermixed and it changed colors as it moved on.  It appeared suddenly and streaked north diminishing in size as it streaked and left sight within milliseconds after I saw it.  I believe in addition to the change of size due to increasing distance as it moved, that it also got smaller itslef.  I screamed to my companions just after the object came into view, but as they turned it had already disappeared.  The sight of the object caught me by surprise.  The night sky was clear, there was no wind to speak of.  The moon was clearly visible in the southern portion of the sky.  Since the street slants, I saw a flash and the object appear from behind a building as it went northward.  It definitely was above the buildings, it made no sound and did not leave a trail.  I saw what seemed to be two commercial jets one flying north the other flying south shortly afterward as I reached the next block heading west and from my vantage point on the ground, I could see the commercial crafts for quite some time by comparison.  I'm not sure if anyone else saw the fireball/UFO but I would be happy to know that someone else did, to confirm.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I would like to say that I was witness to another sighting, that appeared on ABC News, the one that took place in New Jersey. I got home about an hour before. I was kind of bored, so I look out my window. In the sky, I saw what looked like vertical lines in the clouds. I would have not given it another look, but the clouds were greyish-blue, the lines were almost a gold. Then one by one more rips appeared. One was headed towards the Verazanno Bridge(for those who don't know, a pretty large suspension bridge). There were two orbs near the bridge. Then every one of the lines went from vertical to horizontal, and became fireballs, almost like jets. I thought, maybe I'm seeing things, they're just jets, but the jet-trail dissapeared, almost like a comet. The one by the bridge slowly moved, and the two spheres dissapeared, and that one line kind of just drifted, but eventually it went out of my line of sight, due to a tree, and that was it.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I was at the top of the Empire State Building at around 11 pm with 3 other people standing on the side that faces Central Park but looking to go back to the side where the memorial lights were shining in the place of the World Trade Center when one of the people I was with said “Oh, Look up! It’s a shooting star!”  Realizing that when someone spots a shooting star it is usually too late if you don’t happen to be looking in that direction, I was surprised when I followed where she was pointing and actually saw the “star”. It was still traveling much faster than a plane, high in the sky, coming in from my left (from N-W) in a downward arc leaving a bit of a trail.  But what happened next really freaked us out.   The object then slowed down.  It stopped for a fraction of a second (as in hovering) and changed directions going back to the left for another fraction of a second then shot off to the right, made a very brief hesitation, then continued to the right (south-east)  and was gone…no further sign of it.  In all, the Z like movement lasted about 3 seconds. I have never been a believer in UFO’s but I’ve changed my mind.  There I was with 3 other people and we all saw the same thing.  Then I checked out the internet and found that Channel 5 in Seattle had a news report on a similar sighting around sunset their time and that it was explained away by the FAA as a reflection on a plane.  No way …it wasn’t sunset for me!  Taking into consideration the 3 hour time difference, I’d say if it were the same object, it took this “shooting star” about 1 hour to cross the USA from Seattle to NYC.   I want to be in contact with more people who saw this “shooting star”.  I know I’m late in reporting this but I just finally had to say something.  It happened almost a year ago but I can’t get it out of my mind. I want to be in contact with other people who may have seen this “shooting star” on Sept 11, 2006.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Bright Neon Blue/Green Fireball flashed in the Brooklyn Sky on August 16, 2007;2007-08-16 22:50:00;2-3 seconds;Bright Neon Blue/Green Fireball flashed in the Brooklyn Sky on August 16, 2007 My friend and I went outside of my apartment building in Brooklyn to get a few things from the deli. After buying some juice and snacks, we walked across the street back to my building. As we were about to say goodbye and he was about to turn around and walk home, we saw a bright neon blue/green fireball like image in the sky that lasted for 2-3 seconds. It shot very fast and if it was orange or fire color, I'd say we witnessed a meteorite. But because it was neon bright blue/green, it kinda spooked me. Figured I'd write this and send it in. Upon checking online for a good place to document my sighting, I noticed that another person this month saw something very similar out in California. I drew a picture when I got back upstairs. It's too large to fit on my scanner but I could make a reduced copy on a color copier and then scan it to send in to you guys as a follow-up. Never saw a UFO before. And I'm not saying this was an alien sighting or anything like that. Just that I did see something. My friend saw it and so did like 10 or so other people that were hanging around their front stoops on the block. That's Brooklyn.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Towards the north I spotted at first what I described to my sister as a plane on fire but one I exited house an viewed it from yard it looked more like a cone/triangle shaped object that shifted forms somewhat as I viewed it. It was sometimes more triangle shaped than cone but the light on bottom remained what looked like a sphere of fire. After about 30 seconds I got off phone and told my sister to call my mom and tell her to look outside. I then called up my neighbor and talked to him for the duration of event. Unfortunatly he was not home at the time but wanted to listen to my descriptions. I was honestly so amazed and scarred at what I was seeing I was glad to have his presense over the phone. I watched the 1st object for 2-3mins move slowly eastwards and hover before it slowly moved upwards and northeast gradually going over horizon. I rememeber telling my neighbor it was ! gone but I couldn't stop watching sky. My skygazing was rewarded about 30-45 seconds later when another similiar object appeared. This one hovered in sky near the location where 1st one did for about 1 minute before moving north and upwards thru the clouds. My feelings during this event were that I was seeing something I wasn't supposed to be seeing. A ufo here? How come theres not hundreds of other people able to see this. I left event deluding myself into writing it off as a flare and maybe it was. I'm no expert in non commercial aircraft. Lately I'm feeling that I was lucky to see it.

Two bright, orange glowing orbs flying in formation at a steady speed to the Northeast, followed by a third glowing orb.;2012-10-27 21:35:00;4 minutes;Two bright, orange glowing orbs flying in formation at a steady speed to the Northeast, followed by a third glowing orb. I was walking down Metropolitan Ave in the Bronx (Parkchester area)by the Macy's Department store.  I happened to look up at the sky and through a clearing in the clouds witnessed what appeared as two bright, orange glowing orbs flying in formation at a steady speed to the North-East. They did not make any sounds as attributed to regular aircraft.  There were no blinking lights as you would most likely see on regular aircraft.  I observed them for approximately 30 seconds moving through the clouds (the clouds would obscure them at times) until they started to move behind the buildings in the area and I lost sight of them.  As I tried to move to the other side of the street, I witnessed the third glowing orb flying the in the same direction, but far behind the other two bright glowing orbs.  At that point I called my brother in the Westchester Square area of the Bronx, and asked him to access the rooftop of his building to see see if he could observe what I was looking at.  He saw all three glowing orbs in the direction of Parchester as they flew in the same northeasterly direction, and continued to observe them until he lost visibility due to the cloud cover.  He also did not notice any blinking lights or sounds. I was a practicing amateur astronomer for several years, and I would not report this if I knew they were ordinary astronomical phenomena.  This was actually very unusual and I have never witnessed anything like this before.  Thank you.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

It was  positioned exactly above 23rd street and 5th avenue, next to Madison Square Park!   There was cloud cover as it had been cloudy all day and was already dark.  Had about 20seconds to look and look again at this bright orange-red beaming from behind the clouds before going into the subway.   The  bright reddish-orange object/fireball/light did not move.  It was round in shape. Thought it was out of place since the sun sets all the way over by the river, 11th/12th avenues.    Also, I’ve never seen an orange-red moon. Looked around to see if anyone else was seeing this.  No one.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

4 reddish/ orange objects seem in the sky.;2013-08-03 21:30:00;2 minutes;4 reddish/ orange objects seem in the sky. I observed a orange reddish fireball like object in the sky coming from the west . As it passed it was followed by 2 more fireball objects.  All 3 followed in the exact same path and were all identical. Then they all just vanished.  They did not fade into the night, they just vanished.  I then went outside to see if I could spot them again when I saw a forth one go by in the exact same path and vanish in the same spot that the others vanished in.  This occurred at night, the sky was very dark and clear the stars were very visible.   Shortly after the objects vanishe I noticed a white light circling the sky in the same area that the objects had appeared in.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I was driving with my mother and we saw two bright orange lights in the sky.  We pulled over to take a look.  They were hovering very close together one of them was bigger than the thee and they were orange.  They looked fiery.  Had an orange halo light.  One of them disappeared and than the other disappeared within a few seconds.  Drive around and came back in 5 minutes and spotted them again but this time there was three.  They hovered back and forth and they were all close to each other.  They than disappeared into the sky. I ran home to get my brother and sister and took them back to the same location.  When we can back ten minutes later they had appeared again into the night sky and the four of us had seen this.  It was three orange objects hovering again.  They looked like fireballs and then again starting getting farther apart from each other and then closer and then has zoomed off far into space in opposite directions.  They looked like fireballs except one was ! much larger than the other and they seemed to be getting closer and then leaving.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

I was in awe.  They stood hovering for about three minutes.   One went in the direction over my building. I couldn't see where he was.  But the other two stood hovering were they decended from.  Shortly, the two orbes went east. One led the way the other followed.  Then the other that I couldn't see came back to follow the others.   I woke my mother from her sleep.  I didn't want to be the only one seeing this phenomena.  I wonder, did anyone else see what I saw.  Many people here go to sleep late.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

3 orange orbs over Brooklyn, NY;2014-06-30 00:10:00;30-40 seconds;3 orange orbs over Brooklyn, NY At 12:10am on June 30th, 2014, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, NY, my wife and I went out on our patio for a cigarette.  I went out before her, lit my smoke and from the top of the stairs to our patio, my wife asked asked, “What are those?  They aren’t planes.”  I looked up to where she was pointing to the SSW.  There were two orangish orbs that were flickering slightly. The first thought I had was that they were Chinese Lanterns.  However, the hair on the back of my neck stood up as I realized that they were moving towards us and, far too fast to be any sort of lantern or balloon.  The objects appeared to be at 2,000 - 3,000 feet in altitude, moving at 200-300 miles per hour.  The two objects traveled silently and in apparent formation, perhaps 2,500 feet apart.  They traveled at a constant rate and did not change bearing. As the objects approached, not quite overhead, but maybe offset by about 15-degrees from directly overhead, I noticed that the glowing, flickering orange nearly disappeared and I was able to observe the underside of the objects, which appeared round in shape with a dark center and a ring of somewhat dim, fuzzy light around it.  The two objects disappeared behind our building.  I considering running through the front of the apartment to see if I could observe the objects on the other side of the building.  My wife ran inside to grab her camera.  She returned just as a third orb appeared and followed a similar vector to the other two objects. Again, as the third object passed nearly overhead, I observed the same structure as the first two objects.  My wife was able to get one very nondescript, streaked image with her camera but honestly, it doesn’t look like much. The entire incident lasted perhaps 30-40 seconds.  After the three objects had passed, my wife and I were somewhat shaken and tried to make any sense of what we had just seen.   They clearly were not any sort of aircraft or drone that I have seen (and I consider myself an aircraft aficionado along with being a drone and R/C aircraft pilot).  The other thought I had were that perhaps they were some sort of debris entering the atmosphere and burning up, but that would not account for what appeared to be a level flight path. About a minute or so after this, a commercial aircraft crossed the flight path of the objects at a perpendicular angle, heading east.  I have no idea if the pilot of that airliner, likely landing at JFK, was able to see what had just occurred, but I suppose we have no way of knowing.  We checked the internet for any other reports of this incident and found nothing, which is astonishing considering it occurred over New York City.  However, we found Nuforc and filed this report in hopes of anyone else coming out and reporting this.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
Possible sighting of rocket launch, seen from NYC;2014-08-22 04:00:00;60 seconds;Possible sighting of rocket launch, seen from NYC Looking due north at 4am, I saw what appeared to be the flame from a rocket launch from very far away.  It was orange and brighter than Venus.   The approximate direction of travel was west.  It was difficult to tell if its movement was NW, due W, or SW.   I noticed it when it was ~30 degrees above the horizon.  At about 40 degrees, it was blocked by clouds.  The reason I say it appeared to be a rocket flame is because it looked very similar to a Space Shuttle launch into polar orbit that I watched from New Jersey many years ago.

Fireball gliding over Brooklyn at 19:43, jumping flames within it heading a northeastern direction.9-11-14.;2014-09-11 19:43:00;2 minutes;Fireball gliding over Brooklyn at 19:43,jumping flames within it heading a northeastern direction.9-11-14 At 19:43 this evening of 9/11/14, I was walking West to meet my husband at his job.I was walking down 40th Street in Brooklyn toward 3rd avenue.  I was on the phone with my friend from work and to my left, in the sky, I saw a ball of flames gliding in the sky.  It was gliding at the rate which a balloon would glide,not fast or slow just an easy glide...I kept looking to figure out what it was,all I could tell was there were flames bouncing up and down inside this ball.  The sky was dark behind it.  You could still tell there was a dark halo above the flames,as if they were encapsulated in a ball, sort of oval/egg shaped encapsulated.   It continued to glide in a North Eastern direction for about 2 minutes, until it passed over buildings and out of my view.  There was only one,the color of the flames were red/orange glowing with white tips.   I am going to draw a photo of what I saw and mail it to you, along with emailing a photo I got on my cell phone.  My phone would not allow me to video.  The video part was not showing up for me to activate, that was weird as well.   I was able to enable video, once the fireball disappeared. It was at a height where you knew it was high up ,but low enough that it was clear to see the bouncing flames within it.  I have never seen anything like this in my entire life.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

It was definitely lower than the moon in the sky.

When the fireworks didn't explode that's when my interest peaked.  The fireballs moved up from the horizon (did not see their origin, just moving straight up) and then hooked a left towards the Verrazano Bridge.  They were traveling for about a minute and then were no more.  There could have been more but I saw 13 objects, bright orange and red.  They all originated from the same point in the horizon but when they turned left towards the VB they have different flight patterns.  Did anyone else see them?;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Red light hovering and flashing.;2017-01-27 01:30:00;30 minutes;Red light hovering and flashing. This morning, around 1:30AM, I was laying my bed and playing on my phone.  Every night I hear an airplane like turbulence noise.  Usually I think nothing of it, but this morning the noise sounded so close that it caused my bed and walls to move and my ears feel like they would pop.  The sound zooms over my house, so I get up to look out the window.  I see a red light (shown in the video I Emailed).  It moves slowly toward East and stays there for a good 30 min.  Then moves back North and stays.  It starts to flash a light towards the ground. It does that twice, almost like in a circle.  Then the third time it flashes at my window.  I freak out and decide to go back to bed (my cat in my bed also was scared. She started to meow weirdly, like she does when begging for water, but she didn’t move to drink). I’m not sure when the light stopped shining because I fell asleep.  I didn't want to tell anyone, because I thought maybe it was a helicopter possibly looking for someo! ne.  Then in the morning my four year old sister, getting ready for school, tells my mom that someone was knocking on the window last night and she was scared to leave her bed to wake my mom.  My mom thinks nothing of it.  I show my mom the video and she tells me what my little sister told her.   At first I thought maybe it was me she heard because I was by the window to film.  When my sister leaves school, I ask her a few questions (I Obviously didnt tell her that it may be aliens because she would never sleep again).  We ask if it was a bang or a knock.  She said it was a Continuous knock that caused her to wake up.  We asked what window and she said the one by her bed, NOT the one I was recording out of.  My mom then asked if she saw anything, and she said she saw a person with no hair.  I asked if it was fat and she said no, that he was very skinny.  I don’t know how reliable a four year olds word is, but I got chills.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379

Orange fireball, flying horizontally, stops, hovers, drops hot liquid debris 4-5 times, then flies upwards into space.;2017-09-10 22:30:00;5 minutes;Orange fireball, flying horizontally, stops, hovers, drops hot liquid debris 4-5 times, then flies upwards into space. My husband saw a glowing orange sphere travel east to west outside our large factory window.  He told me to come see what he thought was a “helicopter on fire.”  The object was large, at least the size of a helicopter.  Planes coming and leaving La Guardia airport continued to fly in their usual paths.  They were distinguishable as planes. This object was indistinguishable.  It did not sparkle, but its colors shined with a twinkling quality, and its colors of orange and red rotated or mixed like lava.  It hovered as I approached the window and stayed completely stationary for about three minutes above buildings at about half a mile away.  It was soundless.  My husband said the sphere appeared to be dropping debris.  He saw glowing, orange debris drop four or five times.  I saw it drop debris the last instance.  The debris appeared to be liquid, like molten lava.  It dropped about 20-30 feet and disappeared. The orange and red sphere was only a sphere.  No tail, blade, or landing skids could be seen, which would have been illuminated had it been some kind of aircraft on fire.  At this point, my husband began taking a video with his iPhone. I became very alarmed, thinking, if it were a helicopter, it would be going down, without question, because for that much debris to fall, the interior of the helicopter would have to be completely aflame.  But there was no smoke and no actual flames.  Just the look of something hot and burning, which grew slightly in intensity.  The sphere seemed more to be emitting light than on fire.  Finally, the sphere started flying upwards.  We watched it ascend at a slight angle east another two minutes before it disappeared into far up into space traveling about as fast as a plane, but at an altitude much higher than we have seen planes fly.;40.7483469960586;-73.9887105671379
