Over a few days/weeks, big green flash in sky, 2 orange lights glowing, some odd static electricity.;2012-11-08 21:45:00;??;Over a few days/weeks, big green flash in sky,  2 orange lights glowing, some odd static electricity. Over the past few weeks, I have noticed some interesting activity. I was outside at work a few weeks back on our nightly break, when I saw a big green flash behind the clouds. It was very large in the sky. I was so shocked, I could barely express what I had seen.  That seemed to be the most significant thing to me, but I didn't feel like it was worth writing about until the last few nights. On my way home from work, I drive down a strip of road with fields on both sides. Being fall time, they're really empty and easy to see across.  For the past few nights, I've noticed 2 bright orange balls of light on both the north and south horizons.  Very far out, but still noticeable from my car. The first night I thought they were interesting, and then I saw the same thing the second night. The first night was very cloudy - couldn't see a star in the sky. I could however see these orange balls.  They weren't flashing or moving, just staying very still on the horizons.  Last night was exceptionally clear, and they were clearly visible in the same spots.  They are definitely a whole lot brighter than the rest of the things I could identify in the sky (stars, planes, etc). On a possibly related note, I've noted a significant increase in the static electricity around here. I got shocked a whole bunch of times last night from doorknobs, in the same place I work every night. I know the time of year probably has something to do with it.  When I woke up this morning, 2 lightbulbs (maybe more?) in my house were dead.  The incandescent kind. Both are bulbs that get a LOT of use in the house, and could have coincidentally died at the same time. I just thought it was interesting. As far as my (the observer) background goes...not much. I certainly am interested in UFO sightings, but have only ever seen a few times something I couldn't explain.  These few phenomenon in the past weeks have me puzzled, so I figured I'd say something - maybe other people have seen it too! :]  Thanks.;43.09;-75.7633
