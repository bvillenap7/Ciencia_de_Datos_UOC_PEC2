2 flashing objects in the sky. Almost appear as if they are talking to each other.;2001-08-24 23:33:00;Ongoing;2 flashing objects in the sky. Almost appear as if they are talking to each other. At approx. 23:33pm on Friday August 24,2001, myself and my father have witnessed and are still witnessing 2 objects in the sky a ways apart, flashing different colors, from red to blue to white. At first my father believed that they were quazars but one of them moved. It moved as we were standing still in one spot. It would reappear a short distance away from the original spot. When looking at these objects, I could notice that at one point it appeared they were shaped like a boomerrang, then they would change into a circle. This is very strange, how do I go about getting this investigated? Both my father and I are law enforcement officers.
