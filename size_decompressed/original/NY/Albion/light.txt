A bright blue-white light that hovered for almost an hour then quickly zoomed away.;1975-07-20 01:30:00;1 hour;A bright blue-white light that hovered for almost an hour then quickly zoomed away. I saw a bright, blue-white light in the west about 15 or so above the horizon. I watched it for about 15 to 20 minutes (maybe for a half hour), then awakened my parents.  My mother got up, but my father refused to.  My mother and I watched the object for perhaps another 15 to 20 minutes.  The object did not move for all of that time.  Finally, the object zoomed away to the north or north-west, first dipping down maybe 5 degrees and then turning up at a sharp angle, disappearing in less than one second.

Disappearing Lights In The Sky...;2005-03-04 22:30:00;2 minutes;Disappearing Lights In The Sky... Around 10:30 PM Eastern Time, I opened my front door to let my dog inside when I noticed a red light floating in the sky over the trees in the south-east towards town. I made a comment to those who were in the house about the light. I told them I didn't think it was a plane because I saw no signs of flashing lights. My friend, who was on the phone, came out to look at what I thought was a UFO. He didn't believe it at first, but when we continued to watch for about a minute, it suddenly disappeared.  The odd thing is, last night (March 3, 2005) around 7:30 PM Eastren Time, I was coming home from baseball practice when I saw the same exact thing. We watched it for about 30 seconds then when we turned the corner, it suddenly disappeared.;43.2398;-78.2068
