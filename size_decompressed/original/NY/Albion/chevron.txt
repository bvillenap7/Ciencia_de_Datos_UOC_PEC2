It made no noise at all, was about the length of two cars, and flew slowly toward the lake just above the treeline. The UFO had no lights and continued its path with no interruption or change in speed. About a year later, another friend of hers called her and told her she had seen the same exact object moving north toward the lake. There has been a lot of undocumented activity I’ve heard of in this area for years and my mom or her friends wouldn’t think of reporting what she saw so I’ve taken the liberty of sending it in.;43.2398;-78.2068
