Multi-colored tear drop shape...Bright Flash...Time Distorted???;2004-01-04 02:20:00;Unsure;Multi-colored tear drop shape...Bright Flash...Time Distorted??? It was around 2:20 AM on January 4, 2004 when 2 friends and I decided to go outside and play a game of football. We were out there for about 3 minutes when we saw a teardroped shape object in the air, slowly descending towards the ground. It stopped roughly 100 feet above the ground. It had a bright green haze around the objects bottom and a orange haze around the top. We watched it for what seemed like five minutes when there was a bright, white flash emitted from the object then it dissapeared.  We stood there amazed for about 30 seconds and we heard numerous dogs beginning to bark and howl. When we went inside the clock read 2:56AM. It felt like we were only outside for 10 minutes at the most. How did time shoot forward half an hour?;43.2398;-78.2068
