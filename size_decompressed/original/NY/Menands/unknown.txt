Appeared to be traveling a great speed then slowed almost to a stop.  Started to move again, then slowed to a crawl again.  Continued to travel west.  We lost sight of it behind trees.  We brought it to the attention of our neighbors, who watched it with us.  My husband is a police sergeant and I am a registered nurse.
