light source in sky changing colors through the ROVGBIV colors seen through telescope.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius?  PD));2007-01-02 21:15:00;ongoing;light source in sky changing colors through the ROVGBIV colors seen through telescope A flashing light came over the hill / tree tops to the east.  I figured it was a star throught he trees.  I went outside tolook and it did not look like a star or planet as it seemed to be flashing through the color spectrun in a repeat pattern.  I got binoculars and confirmed this, then a cheap old reflect telescope.  It definitely is a light source moving through the color spectrum.  It is rising indicating that it is stationary but if this is a planet I would be very suprised. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius?  PD));42.1719;-77.1185
