Stationary sphere in sky looked like a big ball of mercury;2020-02-28 15:00:00;30 seconds;Stationary sphere in sky looked like a big ball of mercury Driving into work and I pulled into parking lot and slowed down and in the sky was a very shiny silver sphere, the sun glistened off it, I figured I would park and get my phone out but when I looked back up it was gone, I even drove back the same way I came in thinking it was only visible at certain angles but it was gone, I wish I wouldâ€™ve never took my eye off it, it was stationary and not moving and reminded me of a round ball of mercury, mirror like reflection;42.1719;-77.1185
