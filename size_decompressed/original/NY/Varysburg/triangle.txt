Two triangular ships seen at night;1997-11-15 21:30:00;15 sec;Two triangular ships seen at night While driving down a back road doing some deer spotting myself and the drive looked up in the sky to see two triangular objects spinning together. From what I can recall, the centers had either an orange or red light and the three points had either an orange or red, one had orange one had red. In the middle there were little white lights flying around it, it kind of looked like how scientist shows movements of atoms. the driver asked if I saw what he say, I said yes, and I was a bit shocked and scared at the same time, he punched the gas to get closer, and as we got past the try line, not even within 8 sec. it was gone and all that was left was a little white light going across the sky. I never really believed in UFO's until I saw that, it was ridiculous and to this day I can’t believe a saw such a spectacle. I don’t know what it was doing, the movement was unreal, like out of a movie, thinking about it makes my stomach drop, I want to see it again, but this may have been a once in a lifetime special.
