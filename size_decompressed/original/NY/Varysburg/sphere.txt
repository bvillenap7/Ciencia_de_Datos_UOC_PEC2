Upon verification of observation from witnesses, confirmation was made.  Further observation noted that the object traveled at a steady pace towards power generating windmills in Wethersfield NY.  The object was observed on Maxon Rd. 1 mile from South of Rt20A near high tention power lines. Any other observation of this event would be apreciated as there is a discourse in other family members accepting what has been seen.  Although this event was observed years ago, I have finally found somewhere that I may explain what has happened without ridicule.;42.7434;-78.3207
