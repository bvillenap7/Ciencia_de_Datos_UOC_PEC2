PD));2009-09-19 20:10:00;30 seconds;Fishers Island, Long Island Sound there was a large lamp shade/flashlight light in the sky for 10 seconds+  it fadded away into the sk Beach party early in the night. 20+ people saw most of the event. 10+ saw it turn on and then called out to the rest.  There was a light in the sky like a huge lamp or a flash light. It was turned on over Long Island Sound and very obvious light.  We saw it and then it faded slowly UP outward away from us.  It did not go right, left or down, it just faded away. the light lingered in the sky for 20-30 seconds and everyone sort of got over it.   It still bothered some of us.  It was nothing like anyone had ever seen not a plane or satalite or anything people who live on an island and looking at the sky had ever seen. It is dark and boring here, we all look at the sky all the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.
