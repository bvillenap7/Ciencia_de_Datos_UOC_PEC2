THEY WERE VERY CLOSE TO THE BRIGHTEST STAR IN THE SKY WHICH IS LOCATED TO THE RIGHT OF MARS.  THESE TWO SPHERES LOOKED TO BE ONLY A FEW FEET APART.  AFTER ABOUT 35 SECONDS OF SEEING THESE GOLDEN COLORED OBJECTS, THE RIGHT ONE BEGAN TO ADVANCE TOWARDS THE LEFT ONE AND THEY EVENTUALLY COMBINED, BECAME LARGER, MAYBE LIKE A 1/4 OF THE SIZED OF A FULL MOON AND THEN THEY DISSAPPEARED.  THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF THEM AFTER THAT, NO LIGHT IN THE SKY, NO SPARKS, NOTHING.  THEY WERE ABOUT THE SIZE OF TWO STREET LIGHTS, JUST THE LIGHT PART NOT THE POLE. SO THEY WERE CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN STARS BUT NOT AS BIG AS THE SUN OR MOON.   THE CONVREGED AT THERE SIDES,WITH THE RIGHT ONE MOVING TOWARDS THE LEFT ONE.;44.6615049586776;-74.9727380165287
