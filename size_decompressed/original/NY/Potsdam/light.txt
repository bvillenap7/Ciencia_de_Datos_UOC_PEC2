Bright light splits into three;2008-09-02 21:15:00;10 to 15 minutes;Bright light splits into three It was about 9:15pm when I was driving down a highway with very little traffic. I remember that it was a very clear night and you could see a lot of the stars in the distance. As I was driving I noticed a very bright light simply flash off to the right of me, in the distance. At first I though it was the light on a cell phone tower, however the bright flash diminished into a small object that began to move. The object looked like a bright star that would appear and disappear several times. I kept watching the object while still driving. Suddenly it disappeared for a few seconds and then reemerged as a bright light that split into three other moving lights. The three objects moved across the sky in different directions and then simply stopped and moved back in the direction they came from. At that point I began to lose track of them because I was driving into a well-lit town, so it was hard to see anything in the sky.

Slow pulse orange light moved in non-aerodynamic manner;2016-04-15 20:40:00;7-10 minutes;Slow pulse orange light moved in non-aerodynamic manner In the sky southeast of Potsdam appeared an orange light that would disappear and reappear (think like a steady 3 to 4 second pulse) in the sky.  As it reappeared each time, it was appearing the same distance apart.  The movement was not natural or aerodynamically explained  (definitely not a plane or helicopter).  I pulled over to get a better look and it stopped.  Drove home from that point (about 4 minutes) and had 2nd witness outside meeting me.  Upon looking South it started again then stopped again for about 30 seconds.  No further sighting after that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
