Orange light / V-shaped;2008-03-17 20:45:00;5 minutes;Orange light / V-shaped My mother and I were driving home from a friend's. We were about at the Toyota dealership about 2 minutes out of Potsdam, Ny. My mother was just looking at the sky, it was very clear out that night. All of a sudden she says 'What is that?', looking at the orange light in the sky. Then she said 'Oh my Gosh, Look over there in the sky!'. I saw a street light orange colored ball light up and turn, almost like a lighthouse, then disappear.  It was probably 300 feet in the air and maybe a mile away.  Then we drove past the tree line into an open area and  we saw three of the same color lights, same shape and size. We looked over and saw it was accompanied by 2 smaller lights  at a 45 degree angle to the ball. Then we started driving in the direction of town it was over and it was gone. We went down to the park and saw it a few times more in the distance and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
