Orange fireball in sky.;2011-09-16 09:00:00;4 seconds;Orange fireball in sky. I was walking, talking with friends about Jupiter in the night sky, and I looked above to the Southern-ish sky and saw a bright orange fireball about twice the brightness and diameter of the appearance of Jupiter (Currently the brightest object in the sky following the moon).  After nearly 3 to 4 seconds, it faded away into nothing.  The object did not move, and was extremely bright.  I have since heard of four similar events in the surrounding areas near Potsdam, NY, in the past 7 days.;44.6615049586776;-74.9727380165287
