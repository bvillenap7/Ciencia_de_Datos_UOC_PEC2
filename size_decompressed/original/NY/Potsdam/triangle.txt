I was riding my bike down Bay street headed towards Pierpont ave when I noticed bright lights coming from about 40-50 yards above the water of Racket River to my right. There were multiple lights in a vertical line following each other, if you looked directly at them it would look like the shape of the big an little hand on a clock lit up like it was 1:25. they came on like a switch, the power was bright enough to cast shadows from the trees and houses in front of the water. It was dusk and i assumed the light source was fire works because of the holiday. But when I looked at them they were motionless, they were not falling down like a firework cascade would normally do. I realized pretty quick that all of the lights were slowly moving together as if they were all connected to the same object. Then the lights when out, they were only illuminated brightly for less than 10-20 seconds. You could still see the light very dimly lit, the object was changing its position in the sky, it was turning from vertical to horizontal. I was silent, it made no noise I can recall. It was clear that it was triangle in shape, its size was around 50 yards roughly. It was hard to say how, but I fell like it was not that thick. It then moved very gradually up into the sky until i could no longer see it. The whole event took around 2-3 minutes, but I will never forget it. I thought it was a government project or something. Whatever it was I have never seen commercial technology move the way it did. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));44.6615049586776;-74.9727380165287

I was smoking a cigarette on the fire escape and i thought i saw a shooting star.  But it moved upward and then back down.  It then hovered, it seemed to waver around in the sky.  We watched it dance around for an hour and fifteen minutes.  It was moving from the north to north north east and downward(over the full time.).  It was triangular shaped, the lights followed the sides to the bottom tips to the top tip, but none on the center bottom. They gave off different flashing colors:mostly blue/white(these were more constant-harder to tell apart but you could notice a difference at times), red, almost orange at times. the red light seemed to appear more in the middle, while white was on the bottom and blue seemed to remain near the top tip.  near 4:00 it seemed to project some weird red light.  It was not a beam, but more like a red dash in the sky.  This light would flash on and off, but only appeared about 7 times.  I almost stopped watching until i saw that different light.  and the sound, it was a dull roar, easy to dismiss, almost the sound of a helicoptor, but the sound was too constant, it just wasn't a helicoptor.  One plane flew by about 5 minutes before i could no longer see it.  It flew over the ship i was watching about 2 minutes after the red beams flashed.  the ufo seemed to almost get nervous and hovered around quicker than before. I have a tremendous feeling of fear, uncontrollable cold chills, my eyes are teering up. i can't get rid of it.;44.6615049586776;-74.9727380165287
