Wife saw object in sky which was very high glowing from orange to redish, moving from east to west very slowly.   I thought it was a plane at first, then when we stopped walking to see if it was moving it was slowing down and came to a complete stop in the north western section of the sky.   The size of it was like a typical star but slightly brighter than a planet and in a orange redish color then suddenly it had a slight burst of red and slowly started to fade.  I have seen small aircraft and even high altitude planes that could fool someone for a min as a UFO but this WAS NOT a plane.  I have never witness this before.  It was definitive strange.   I rushed to my computer which was only like 3 mins away to see where the International space station was and it was well past NY and in the lower Pacific Ocean region even though it did have a flight path in the area.  Something was trailing it or something else is going on.;41.0212999999999;-73.6781000000001
