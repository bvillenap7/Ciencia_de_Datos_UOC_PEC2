It was difficult to determine if it was very large object with 3 red lights on it or if it was 3 separate objects. There was no sound at all.  We have never seen anything like it.  There was nothing we could observe that would indicate it was a aircraft.  No blinking lights.  If I were to guess on the speed, it/they were moving I would probably say 40mph.
