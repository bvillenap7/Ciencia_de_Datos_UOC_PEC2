FIrst night of Perseid meteor shower that year. I was on terrace of 6th floor apartment in Port Chester, NY with  open view from east to west facing south. Was outside to see if there were any early meteors, facing the direction from which they were supposed to arise.  It was only about 12:30 a.m., too early to expect to see anything much. Then low, just on the horizon, I saw a bright light.  I remember thinking, wow, this is going to be a heck of a meteor shower, when two boomerang-shaped things - one slightly ahead of the other but in tight formation, flew over.   The 2 objects crossed the entire sky, from the horizon to a point directly overhead and then over my building (disappearing from my view) in about 1.5 seconds... maybe it was 1 second...  maybe 2.  They were a luminous silvery greenish blue color... sort of the color of a cool fluorescent light bulb when it's on, but not as bright.   There were no details, no flashing lights, no windows, and no sound... totally silent. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
