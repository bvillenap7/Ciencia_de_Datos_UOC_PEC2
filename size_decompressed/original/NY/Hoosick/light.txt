Bright star like object moving across the sky, then fading and disappearing.;2012-06-23 23:00:00;1 hour;Bright star like object moving across the sky, then fading and disappearing. We were outside at the drive-in movies when we observed a star-like object moving slowly across the sky. It moved for about 5 minutes and got dimmer and dimmer and disappeared.  We saw this four more times and they were moving at different speeds. This occurred in a span of about one hour. There were several planes in the area that seemed to be tracking it. It was a very clear night so it couldn't have went into cloud cover. Two of us observed the same phenomenon with one object two nights before in Bennington, Vermont.  I am a sixty-year old woman and mentally stable. I've never seen or reported anything like this before. My companions were a forty-tree old woman, a twenty-one year old woman and a twenty-two year old woman. All of sound mind. This experience frightened us but was also very exciting.;42.8918;-73.3564
