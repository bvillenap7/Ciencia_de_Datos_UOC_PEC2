There will be more. Saturday June 25 Five objects spotted. Four travelled North to South. The other travelled West to East. This object was different from most. It appeared to either to be circular with a darker center, or four lights around a darker center. It was not an airplane or satellit. It should be remembered that East to West satellites can NOT be seen from the continental United States, or any lattitude substantially far from the equator (since they only travel along the equator). Sunday June 26 into Monday: Four objects spotted. Three travelled South to North one travelled more slowly than most in a Northwest to Southeast direction. As a side note unrelated to this, a strange rushing sound was heard in the trees. There was no wind or rain. I have no explanation for the noise.;42.9024;-77.6036999999998
This is my sky observation report of objects seen at night. All look like lights.;2005-07-06 22:30:00;1hr;This is my sky observation report of objects seen at night. All look like lights. Sky observation report July 6, 2005  It was a clear night with excellent stargazing. From about 10:30 pm to 11:30 pm many objects spotted. I tried a different part of my yard that has a better view of the sky.Most went South to North and appeared to have erratic flight characteristsics some went very fast.  I simply lost count of the objects. There were far too many to be satellites, and I was out (theorhetically) beyond satellite viewing time.;42.9024;-77.6036999999998
