Both purple in color. (The following happened near sunset over a large farming area.  There was many large and puffy clouds in the sky. They were pink as the sun went down.)   While four wheeling in our field my son heard a loud humming noise.  Thinking it was his four - wheeler he stopped to see what was wrong.  That is when he looked directly up and saw this huge  cockpit coming down out from a cloud toward him.  Then the rest of the UFO also came out from behind the cloud.  The UFO was purple, the back of it was round and a long neck was attached to it with a cockpit on the end.  It had 3 white markings on its side.  My son said the UFO was enormous in size.  It was longer then our 10 acre field.  Almost at the same moment of spotting the UFO a smaller one came out of it.  The smaller of was the size of our Cape-Code house and shaped more like a plane.  This one went in a westerly direction.  Then the large one did a dip toward ground, brought itself up vertical and started spinning in a 360 degree motion and had a blue shield around it.  It made some kind of noise that got faster as the UFO spun faster.  Then with another noise  the UFO shot straight up i! nto the sky.  It was gone in a matter of two minutes.  While the UFO did this, my son’s four- wheeler started to idle roughly and almost stalled.  He also is trying to describe something with the clouds.  Some how the UFO was able to make clouds while using its engines and used to hide in. My son is eleven. He was very scared and in tears. He hasn’t changed his story.  Every detail, from start to finish, he tells the same regardless how many times you ask him about it. He is a good kid, who would never make this up. He thought he was going to die right there in our backfields.;43.098;-73.5046000000002
