An indescribable feeling/light felt/seen in a short instant.;2003-03-15 01:00:00;unknown instantaneous?;An indescribable feeling/light felt/seen in a short instant. This is a weird one... sometime in spring of this year (I estimate March), I was awoken in the middle of the night by a strange sensation and a flash of light. This was no ordinary flash of light, mind you. In one split (micro?) second, I was awake, fully conscious, had an indescribable feeling, and saw the brightest light I have ever seen. It encompassed my entire field of vision. I later learned that a friend of mine, one block over, and another friend, while at a party in Maine, saw/felt this same thing. I posted on an internet forum afterwards (maybe the day after) about it, and others on the East Coast had seen it as well. Chilling! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
