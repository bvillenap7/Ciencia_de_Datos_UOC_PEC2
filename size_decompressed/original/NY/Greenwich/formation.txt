Two Very Bright Lights, vertical position, of the Hudson River.;2002-01-12 17:00:00;5:30pm;Two Very Bright Lights, vertical position, of the Hudson River. The formation I saw was two very bright lights, it looked like they where stacked on top of one another, you couldn’t see anything except the bright lights. At first I saw them and thought it was a airplane. And then it never moved and the lights where arranged differently, and they where to big and bright to be a airplane. At the same time I looked around because they would keep disappearing and reappearing. And I saw a plane way to the right of me and that was moving and blinking (like planes do). So I kept watching for this formation, I finally stopped my car and watched for it, because when the lights would go away, there was NOTHING there. Then it would appear in the same spot again, not moving. The area I saw this is over the hudson river between Mechanicville – Saratoga area. When I drive home I can see this stretch of the river for about 20-25 mins., because I drive parallel to the river.  All of the sudden it just disappeared and was gone. I just got the nerve up to tell the guys at work and they gave me this site. My Husband just laughed at me, but I had a really weird feeling when this whole thing was happening.;43.098;-73.5046000000002
Three white lights in a triangular formation slowly moving from west to east;2017-11-09 17:30:00;~2 minutes;Three white lights in a triangular formation slowly moving from west to east. 3 lights observed in a triangular formation heading west to east.  Altitude appeared to be very high as lights were not extremely bright.  At first we thought it was stars but only then we observed they were moving slowly.  Solid white no blinking.  When they were about 30 degrees off the horizon, the leading light vanished went out then within 15-20 seconds, the left light went out and about 10 seconds late, the third light went out.  Not a sound was heard the entire time.  If it was just one light, one may think it was a satellite but to see the three in formation has us wondering.  That's why I'm here.  Someone had to have seen this as well???;43.098;-73.5046000000002
