Was standing out in a field unwinding with some friends and as I was putting out my cigarette I caught a flash in the sky, we all looked up and watched this continuing flashing pattern grow and grow. The object then illuminated so that we could see a triangular shapes, we almost thought we heard a faint humming sound coming from it, it stayed in one spot for about 5 minutes, started to move westward slowly, and then about 2 minutes later increased speed and was gone in almost the blink of an eye.
