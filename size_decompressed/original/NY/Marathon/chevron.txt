4 lights as bright as stars zoomed past orions belt;2011-02-04 19:00:00;20 Seconds;4 lights as bright as stars zoomed past orions belt While riding the ski lift, my friend and I were just checking out the stars since it was such a clear night.   As I was studying all the stars near Orion’s belt, I saw what looked like a clump of shooting stars at first.   Four circular lights that were bright as stars literally zoomed out of no were into the area of this constellation.   I assumed shooting stars at first but as I watched the lights seemed to rotate to the right, as they did this the fourth light became more like a full circle and less of an ellipse like when it first appeared in the sky.  These lights were not flashing, there was no sound, they were as big as a star in the sky and they moved from the right side of Orion’s belt to the left in literally two seconds.   I derived the idea that this is chevron shaped since one of the lights became more visible, and since it did a quick bank turn following the first rotation it made.  It flew past several other stars in the area incredibly fast before taking off upward and disappearing as fast as it zoomed into the night sky.   The whole incident lasted no more than 20 seconds and a marvelous and mysterious short time that was.  After seeing an airplane in the night sky last night, I compared the speed to what I saw last Friday and can honestly say that the airplane’s speed was nothing compared to the mysterious lights.;42.4519;-76.0414
