We watched it move at a steady speed in a straight path across the sky, We saw a large fireball in the sky below a ceiling of clouds.  We were in a campground in the hills of Dansville.  At first we thought it was the fire from a hot air balloon as there was a Balloon festival that weekend.  However, the ball of fire was much larger than a balloons would be at the close distance, it was moving much faster than a balloon but not fast enough to be an aircraft that was also a consideration beacuse there is also a small airport in the area.  We watched it move at a steady speed in a straight path across the sky, right to left,(Mars being on the right)and then it looked like it shrunk and dissapeared. We took 2 or three pictures on a disposable camera but as of yet have not had it developed.  I figure it won't look like much.  The next morning I called that area airport to make sure that any aircraft in the air at night should have the blinking lights (which he said yes) and to see if hot air balloons were allowed up at night (which he said no).  I then asked him if he had any reports of anyone seeing anything in the sky last night (which he said no).  When I hung up I heard the news on TV that there were many sightings in Calafornia that same night three hours after our sighting.  I am a night sky watcher and have never seen anything like it. Please contact me if your interested in a detailed description of our location or the pictures;42.5700000000001;-77.7109
