Saw a flash of light in the night skys of Dansville, New York.;2014-09-14 22:55:00;2 seconds;Saw A flash of light in the night skys of Dansville, New York. On the night of September 14, 2014, at around 22:55, I was walking into work.  I always look up at the sky.  I work in Dansville, N.Y., and that night it was a clear night.   As I was walking in to work I saw a flash of Light.  It lasted about 2 seconds and was bright enough to light up the sky and to be able to see detail of the hills like it was day time.   I checked to see if there was any Storms in the area for lightning but, the closest lightning strikes was over 1,100 miles away.  I also listen to see if I could hear the fire whistle because of the brightness of the light I thought that maybe there might have been an accident or maybe something exploded like a transformer.   Something logical to explain the flash but, there was no noise and the fire department was not deployed.  So I have no idea what the flash was.  It was strange.;42.5700000000001;-77.7109
