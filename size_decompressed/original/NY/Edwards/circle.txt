Circular shaped object in the sky hovered over my car and followed us down the road;2018-11-23 18:15:00;2 minutes;Circular shaped object in the sky hovered over my car and followed us down the road I was in the car headed home from Christmas shopping with my mother in law and my two-year-old son.  We were on the road that I live on and it happens to be a back road.  I rounded a corner and there was a deer in the road so I slowed down to a stop.  As we crested the hill and started to speed up I noticed an object in the sky on the passenger side of the vehicle, I pointed to it and noted that it looked like a planet (big and bright) but it was far too big.  It stayed stationary and we pointed it out to my son, but at a certain point my mother in law noted that it appeared to be getting bigger and moving closer to us. Seconds later it was near us and we acknowledged that it was a round object with white/yellow lights and a red light on the bottom.  I slowed down to look at it and by then it was huge and close to the car.  It was still round, but I noticed three white/yellow lights in a circular shape with a large red light in the center.  It hovered over the treetops and by then it was huge, larger than my car.  I got nervous and decided to start driving again and as I started to move it moved to the other side of the road and disappeared. 	My mother in law and I were stunned and couldnâ€™t believe what we had seen, it was the strangest thing we had ever seen.  We talked about it the day after it happened and recalled that while it was large and right over top of us we never once heard any noise, and the radio was off (we had been talking).  The sheer size of the object in comparison to our car was also something that we noted as well as the lights lighting up the inside of our car briefly while it was over us.  The entire encounter lasted right around 2-3 minutes and the incident occurred 2 miles from where we live.;44.3138;-75.2526
