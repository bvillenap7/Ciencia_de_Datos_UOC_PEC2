That is what struck me as weird and there was no engine noise.;1980-08-20 01:00:00;30 min;It was 1980 or 1981 in my home town of Edwards NY. I was up late one night and saw three objects above the meadow of the farm acrossed the the road from my home.  My family hunted a lot so there was a spare rifle scope in the gun cabinet.  I took it with me crossed two roads to the back meadow.  It was funny it was like the object could sence me getting closer because at first they where right over the meadow and seem to back off as I walk closer.  With the 3X9 scope I could see they looked like a clam shell shape and with several different color that seem to strobe and they seem to be hovering not flying.  That is what struck me as weird and there was no engine noise. They seem also to be in a slight V formation.  I was only 15 or 16 and heard some strange noise in the tree near me so turn and run back to the house.  When I got back to the house about 400-500 yard.  I turn and they were gone.   I never told to many people because I was by myself and most people do not believe in UFO's.  I thought it might be the ARMY testing something because FORT DRUM is about forty mile from my old home stead. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
