There were two sets of streaks white and orange.  The streaks lasted for over 30 minutes.  Also there was an interesting object that appeared in the photos but not to the naked eye.;42.8699999999998;-77.2790999999998
2 Stationary flashing red lights west of Canandaigua, NY. 500 feet above the ridge west of Cheshire.;2009-02-21 02:00:00;10 minutes;2 Stationary flashing red lights west of Canandaigua, NY. 500 feet above the ridge west of Cheshire. Around 2 am I looked out my west facing dining room window. I saw 2 synchronized flashing lights hovering about 500 feet above a ridge that is about a mile from my house. The craft, (assuming the 2 lights were on the right and left edges), was around the size of a half dollar held at arms length. I watched the flashing lights for more than 5 minutes & they did not move. Curious, I stepped outside to watch them more closely. Unlike helicopters I have seen and heard in the area, there was no distinguishable sound. I have not lived in the house for more than a couple of months, so after about 10 minutes of watching the lights, I decided that it must be a communications tower that I had not previously noticed. I went back to bed. In the morning after the sun came up, I realized that there is no tower or any structure that could be confused with the object that I saw.;42.8699999999998;-77.2790999999998
