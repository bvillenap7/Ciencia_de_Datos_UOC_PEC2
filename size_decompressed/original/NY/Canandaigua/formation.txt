30-35 lights appearing from the horizon moving in a perfectly straight line and disappearing overhead.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-22 20:30:00;10 minutes;30-35 lights appearing from the horizon moving in a perfectly straight line and disappearing overhead We observed a formation of lights moving in a straight line appearing from the northern horizon and going in a south westerly direction. They appeared to be coming from a single point on the horizon, one after another in an almost perfectly straight line approximately 300 to 500 yards apart from one another. Once they got to a point in the sky directly overhead, they would disappear into the night sky. We didn’t take an actual count, but best estimate would be at least 30-35 separate lights. They we’re not flashing or blinking like you would expect from airplane lights. And they were too low to be satellites. The whole event happened within 6-7 minutes and they we're not visable to my camera phone. Also, they didn’t make any noise like you would expect from jet engines flying at that height. I can only assume they we’re military planes taking off one after another, but I can’t imagine why they would release that many in a row, and why I wouldn’t hear they’re! jet engines? That’s why I believe we just witnessed a fleet of UFO’s.;42.8699999999998;-77.2790999999998
