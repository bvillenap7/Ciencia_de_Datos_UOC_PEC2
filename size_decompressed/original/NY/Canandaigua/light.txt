Light in the ski like a star hovering;2002-04-02 23:30:00;5 minutes;Light in the ski like a star hovering I went outside and noticed a light really super high in the ski.  It almost looked like a star. The light would go in one direction and the turn around and go in the other.  What made it stand out from a plane is that it would stop before turning in the other direction and just hover in the air.  I ran inthe house and told my wife to come watch what was happening.  My mother in law who lives and for boy friend I also told to come out and watch.  We noticed four jets all coming from the same direction heading directly toward the light.  The light then turned and went away from the jets super fast and disappeared over Canandaigua Lake.  neither the jets or the light made a sigle sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A small fleet of UAP flying over a residential street.;2011-06-24 21:00:00;6 minutes;A small fleet of UAP flying over a residential street. As I was turning onto my block while driving in the car with my wife I noticed some red glowing objects in the sky.  At first I thought they were fire works, or something.   I had my wife pull over the truck and I grabbed her iphone to snap a shot and got out.  I quickly realized these were like nothing I had ever seen before.   As they came over the horizon they glowed a reddish/orange and made a noise like you would here with a jet or a plane.  The noise quickly faded and there were about 12 glowing lights and 3 or so black disc shaped craft flying with them all silently.   The lights started to fade out revealing they were all black disc like craft.  The lights would either fade out or dim down to one point on the disc, they all flew in the same direction with no noise.   I watched them closely until they were all out of sight and filmed a few minutes of footage showing the lit ones and you can see 2 of the non-lit ones flying in the bunch.   I do not know what I saw but I got this feeling like I was witnessing something not normal, and I have never seen anything like that before.
