Triangular craft watching Bristol Mountain Ski Resort;1977-11-26 14:00:00;1 to 2 hours;Triangular craft watching Bristol Mountain Ski Resort This sighting is going back some years now, but I can remember the precise weekend in which this UFO was seen by 5 people at the same time, just like it was yesterday.  I have created a drawing of what I remember the craft looking like which I  included with this report made on Microsoft paint. It was 1977 at Bristol Mountain Ski Resort in Bristol Valley , Canandaigua, New York, the weekend that followed  Thanksgiving  Day which was November 24th, 1977.  Bristol Mountain ski resort was teaming with activity for the holiday weekend, that’s when we really used to get snow. I worked in the snack bar on the bottom floor of the Ski Lodge, along with 4 other people present that day.  We cooked Hamburg’s,  hotdogs, fries and such for customers visiting the ski resort. The only window’s in the snack bar area were a row of windows located higher up on the wall just below the ceiling, facing the Mountain across the street from Bristol Mountain ski resort.  These are the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, in the finger lakes region. It had been a busy day this Saturday November 26th, 1977.  Lunch hour was packed.  Finally the business dropped of for the snack bar and we were all just goofing around and talking, when one of the guys I worked with yelled out,  Hey , look at this thing across street above the Mountain!  So we all looked out the window’s to see what he was making the big deal about. There was a perfect view of this object above the tree line of the Mountain across the street.  At first you had a hard time seeing it because it was a beautiful sun filled winter day with a dazzling blue sky.  It was like a bright orange yellow glowing severe triangular craft, with like a boomerang back to the triangle, but the craft had a severe point to the front of the triangle like to a sharp point and the back although it had a boomerang shape was not a wide type.  It looked like the shape of a paper air plain you made in school. It was just  sitting still over the Mountain top and was pointed right at Bristol Mt. Resort.  Like it was observing all the activity going on there.   We watched it for sometime until we started getting busy again, and after that point I don’t remember if it just left or what?    Over the years I have told this account to different people at parties and such and always can remember it with clarity.  I was completely blown away while surfing the internet, when I discovered that these triangular crafts have been seen by many people. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
