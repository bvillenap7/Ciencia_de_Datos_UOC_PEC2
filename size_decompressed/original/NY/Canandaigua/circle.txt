Round brite silverish light;2011-10-15 17:00:00;2 min;round brite silverish light I was driving along the lake and i looked to my left to look at the lake and thats when i saw a round brite lite it was so brite it looked silver.   at first i thought it was a helicopter but it was so close i would have seen it and heard it and there was no sound and the light was to big for a spot light on a hilicopter.   it was just above the trees and maybe a 100 feet from me so i turned my head to the right to grab my phone off the seat to take a picture, and when i turned back towards the object to take a picture  it was on the other side of the lake barely visible and then disapeard completely.  i keep on driving up the road about an 8th of a mile and there it was again same distance from the road and just above the trees i grabed my phone to take a picture but the thing shot back across the lake less then 2 seconds and disapeard.  Haven't seen it sence looking for it all the time to try and get at pic. am i crazy? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
