It was rectangular and had 6 red lights on each side.;1994-02-27 00:15:00;5 minutes;It was rectangular and had 6 red lights on each side. Another friend was driving me home on County Rd. 4 in Ontario County, NY.  We both worked at the local VA Hospital, he was an LPN and I was a CNA.  As we headed east we noticed a rectangular object flying very slowly toward us about 75 yards above the road.  As we approached the craft, my friend rolled back the sunroof on his car and slowed down to about 10 mph. We went right under the belly of this craft.  It was rectangular in shape and the nose of the craft was only half as wide as the tail end.  It had 6 red lights on each of the 2 long sides of the craft and it had a very bright white light on the underside of the nose of the craft. My friend asked me what it was.  I told him that no aircraft can fly so slowly and not leave a trail or make no noise and that it must be a UFO.  It was the size of 2 football fields.  And both sides extended well beyond the sides of the road in width.  It was huge!!  The craft was a shiny, black, metallic color.  There were no identifying numbers on the underside as there would normally be on most aircraft.  After we got out from under it, we sped off for home in record time. He still remembers the incident as do I.  No missing time with this sighting as there was with my first report. ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from same source.
