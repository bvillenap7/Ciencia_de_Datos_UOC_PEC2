Moving Light Star Object Then Came to Complete Stop in Sky.;2014-06-26 23:00:00;20 minutes;Moving Light Star Object Then Came to Complete Stop in Sky. On June 26th 2014, my husband and I were outside enjoying the night air in late evening.  It was a bright night with many stars.  We noticed a bright moving ‘star’ moving across the sky northward in a straight line as far out as the other stars.   Suddenly stopped in the middle of the sky directly above our line of site.  It did not move after it stopped… it stood completely still like a normal star for the entire time,  which was about 20 minutes.   The thing was not flashing or anything just a brighter light than the other stars.  Got a little spooked and went inside.
