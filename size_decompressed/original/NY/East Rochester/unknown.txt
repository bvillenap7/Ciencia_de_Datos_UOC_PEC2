Early morning silent runner;2004-10-02 03:00:00;10 min;Early morning silent runner I was on an early morning stroll with my brother and we stopped and sat on some stairs in an alley. Directly over head I noticed shimmering patterns of light, and then gradually discerned what appeared to be a large craft moving silently and slowly at a low altitude. I did not point it out to my brother. The craft had shifting color patterns and a haze about it which made it almost invisible at times. On the skin of the craft domes and structures could be seen.
