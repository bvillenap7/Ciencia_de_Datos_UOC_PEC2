Objects in the sky over Rochester, NY;2005-06-24 22:46:00;20-25 seconds;Objects in the sky over Rochester, NY At 10:46 pm I went outside my house located in East Rochester, NY to have a smoke. While I was looking at some of the brighter stars in the sky I noticed what I thought was a jet of sorts cruising at a very slow rate of speed. As I watched it, it split into three parts which had a sort of redish glow to all of the parts. Standing outside of my house these objects would have been East towards Metro Rochester. They looked circular in shape or even ovalish. I could not see the color of them but within about 15 seconds the three objects stopped in mid air. One went East, one went West and the third shot up into the sky and as soon as I looked to see the other two they were all gone. I did not hear any noise at all. I don't think i could guess the speed of the objects but it was super quick.;43.1078;-77.4947
