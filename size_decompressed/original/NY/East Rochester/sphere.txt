The sky was clear the weather was nearly perfect. I was standing on West Commercial near the corner of Main Street here in East Rochester watching a centenial parade when I noticed this black sphere slowly moving NNE fairly slowly. My view of it was obstructed by the buildings across the street after only a few seconds and never saw it again. It seemed to be void of any features. No lights, wings, or protrusions of any kind could be seen. Due to the parade, I could not tell if it emitted any sound. I am not a good judge of size and distance so I'm sorry to say that I have no reliable reference. My guess would be that it was maybe a half mile away and maybe 20 feet across. Again this could be so far off due to my being blind in one eye and not having any depth perception what so ever. I was standing with a friend, but didn't ask him about whether he saw anything until after it was no longer visable. He had not seen it. I didn't hear anyone else nearby talking about it. This is the second time in about two years that I have seen an object like this. The first was not far away in Rochester NY and was not too far east of the Monroe County International Airport and was certainly in one of the normal flight paths. That one was much higher and farther with no sound being heard from it. I did see another just like it on a TV show (on FOX I believe) last year and recognized it as the exact same thing that I saw. No doubt about it, it was exactly the same. The one in the TV show was video taped from a car and I think it was out of the passenger side window. I'm pretty sure of this but I cannot remember the name of the show and it may have even been one of the programs on TLC, but I think it was on FOX.;43.1078;-77.4947
