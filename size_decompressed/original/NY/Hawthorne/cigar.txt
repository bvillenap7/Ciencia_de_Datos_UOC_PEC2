Mysterious flood lights spotted in sky;2012-02-03 00:45:00;3-4 seconds;Mysterious flood lights spotted in sky As I was driving home from work I was on route 9A heading north.   As I came around the bend by the movie theater I looked up through my windshield into the sky and at around a 50-60 degree angle I saw 1 object that had 6 bright white lights moving in synchronization as if they were part of an aircraft.  The lights had space in between them but smaller than the actual lights.  The UFO was in an I shape going up and down.  The object went down towards the earth and then behind clouds, vanishing after without a sign.  The object appeared to be as long as the moon but it was also approximately 1-2 miles away in the sky.  The lights were very bright, they looked like flood lights from 50 feet away. I pulled over to use my iPhone 4s compass to determine the direction of the lights and they were 35 degrees NE and my location was 41• 5'52 N, 73• 48'33 W.;41.1102;-73.8044
