A sphere shaped object  crossing across the night sky;2001-08-08 23:00:00;10 seconds;A sphere shaped object  crossing across the night sky It was a clear night with a full moon present. While standing on the beach admiring the star filled sky with 4 other family members we noticed a sphere shaped object track across the night sky. This object appeared to me metallic in nature as the light from the full moon was reflecting off of it at diffrent angles as it moved across the sky. The size of the object would be equivalent to a dime viewed at thirty feet. The object tracked across the sky in a straight line. It is interesting to note that there were no lights or sound emanating from the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.
