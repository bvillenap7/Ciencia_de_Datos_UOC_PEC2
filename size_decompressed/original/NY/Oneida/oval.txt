Green, Red and Blue Ball of Light Seen in the Sky above Oneida, NY;2007-01-20 00:10:00;10 Seconds;Green, Red and Blue Ball of Light Seen in the Sky above Oneida, NY I was driving home from work this evening and took a right onto the street our house is on.   When almost to my driveway I caught something out of the corner of my eye.  I looked up and saw a ball of green light moving through the sky, following what seemed to be the same path as the road but above me way up in the sky.   It turned from green to red and then from red to a light blue.   The object then darted left and then took of right and disappeared.   This is the first time I had ever seen such a thing in the sky.  There is no doubt in my mind that this object was something not of this world.;43.0820999999998;-75.6474000000006
