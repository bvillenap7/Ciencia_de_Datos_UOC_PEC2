Orange light below cloud layer at near darkness.;2020-04-15 20:20:00;3 minutes;Orange light below cloud layer at near darkness. Let dog out at 8:20 PM, stood on patio looking north. Complete overcast cloud layer, slight drizzle rain/sleet.  Sky was 95% toward total darkness after sunset. Saw what I thought to be Mars (same color/size), realized sky was completely overcast and light was in wrong part of the sky. Saw slight upward movement over the period of 30 seconds of observation, then light grew larger (size doubled) over period of 30 seconds (perceived to be moving toward my location).  Light then turned to the east, moved behind tree, and became smaller and moved upward until it was obscured by the cloud layer. Orange colored single light source, slight variation in intensity (not strobing) as it came closer. Total time was 3-4 minutes of observation. Reported sighting to my wife when I reentered my home.;42.9237;-76.4098
