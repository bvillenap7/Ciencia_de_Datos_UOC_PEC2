It was right over me my roof, and I saw what I thought was an airplane that was ENORMOUS. It just kept flying in a circle above me, . I was confused very concerned. I can't stop thinking about it, everyday...I remember the heaviness and the sound of heavy. I've spoken with Kevin, I'd like to speak with him again.  Thank you;42.9237;-76.4098
