Was about 10 feet in diameter, and 10-20 ft off ground I was driving down a back road in the woods and was turning onto another road when I saw what first appeared to be a very low helicopter.   I was stopped at a stop sign and took a better look at it.   Whatever it was, it was not a helicopter-there was no sound at all, there were multiple white lights around the entire object (it was circular in appearance), and there was a spot light above these lights.  The object was only 10-20 feet from the ground.   I continued on the road I turned on, turned around as soon as I could, returned to the location, and the object was gone.;42.9237;-76.4098
