Triangular object with white lights and 3 smaller chasing lights;2004-10-27 22:30:00;3-4 seconds;Triangular object with white lights and 3 smaller chasing lights We were outside watching the lunar eclipse, when a slow moving object caught my eye. It was triangular shaped with 4 white lights along 2 sides. I asked my husband, do you see that? He said no at first, and then he said 'Oh, yeah, what is that? When we discussed it a few seconds later, I had seen the triangular object, but he had seen 3 lights circling around in the same area kinda chasing one another. The triangle formation looked mechanical as it held it's shape perfectly. The lights weren't very bright and were moving fairly slowly. The 3 lights were quick. No sound at all.
