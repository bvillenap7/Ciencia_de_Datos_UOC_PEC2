((SERIOUS REPORT??))  The ships were humming and faintly glowing.;2010-04-12 00:00:00;10 minutes;The ships were humming and faintly glowing. I was sleeping in my farmhouse when I heard a strange humming noise that woke me up.  I got up to go to the bathroom and looked outside my window.  There were 2 ships like an elongated oval and one was faintly glowing green, the other one red.   I watched in disbelief for 10 minutes as they drove in little circle patterns and woke my wife and son and they finally flew away. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.
