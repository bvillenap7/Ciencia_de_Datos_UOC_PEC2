Multiple unidentified objects over Long Island.;2015-03-28 16:20:00;5-10 minutes;Multiple unidentified objects over Long Island. My two kids and I were at the park flying a kite, when my son noticed the objects first.   It was a little while after that I used my blackberry camera to start taking some video.   There were several objects that made these kind of lazy movements, first in a circular motion then in an infinity symbol type loop, although in the video only 2 or 3 can be seen.  After a while, they just seemed to fade out.   I would like for someone to look at this video and let me know what these craft are.;40.6667161764706;-73.7018499999998
