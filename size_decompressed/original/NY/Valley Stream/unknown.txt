While coming outside to get something from my car I looked up at local plane traffic that was heading for JFK.  I happen to scan across the sky and saw a flash of something at very high altitude, possible orbital (resembling the look of a passing satellite catching sun).  After realizing for a moment that it is still very light I eliminated stars from the possibilities and started to think of a mylar balloon in the sun.  The object lit up again, looking like a star, it would intermittently pulse like this for the next 20 minutes and made a slow counter clockwise path periodically very brilliant (reiterating like looking at a star), and then no light at all.  On many occasions it was completely stationary, I eliminated the balloon theory.  I attempted to video this over 3 clips on my Samsung S5, without zooming.  So far I cannot see anything on the vids.  In my opinion this was extremely high altitude possibly low orbital altitude.  If anyone would like to analyze the video let me know.
