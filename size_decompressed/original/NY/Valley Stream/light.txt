Straight string of small white lights across apex of sky.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-27 20:40:00;2-3 minutes;Straight string of small white lights across apex of sky I looked up to see the stars and waxing crescent moon and saw the start of a straight line of small white lights, each one the size and speed of an airplane flying at altitude. I couldn't see any other red wing lights with the white lights. Some were evenly spaced, some were very close together, some were spaced like dots of Morse code (dot-dot space dot-dot-dot space dot-dot, etc). All the lights were moving in a straight line across the apex of the sky, like they were on a string. The line was moving from the northwest to the southeast. I watched for about 20-30 seconds. The line of lights was long and I couldn't see the end, so I went in and brought my husband out to see. They lasted for another 20-30 seconds. We couldn't hear any noise.;40.6667161764706;-73.7018499999998
