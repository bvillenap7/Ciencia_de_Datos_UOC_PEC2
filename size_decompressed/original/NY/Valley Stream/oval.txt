I looked up and saw a plane.  At the same time I noticed a very large, well-defined, very bright red/orange oval (or perhaps cigar shaped) craft very high in the sky.  It moved methodically and quickly in a straight line.  It didn't pause or stop or hover, it kept moving at an even pace.  I observed it for about 20 seconds until it began to fade and finally disappeared completely.  It didn't flicker, but it remained incredibly bright redish/orange before it moved out of sight and faded.  It was a very clear night, not cloudy. I'm normally skeptical though I do believe there is life elsewhere in the universe.  I don't drink or take drugs and I was completely alert while viewing this.  I didn't have time to call anyone to see it and didn't want to take my eyes off it.;40.6667161764706;-73.7018499999998
