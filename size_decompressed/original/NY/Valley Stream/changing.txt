Orange objects move across sky.  Not commercial aircraft.;2014-06-22 01:00:00;10 minutes;Orange objects move across sky. not commercial aircraft. I came to Our Driveway to retreve items from trunk at approx 1 am , looking over open trunk of car, I see a light in sky. i thought it was a aircraft on fire.  it was joined by two others  they apeeared to be drifting eastward.  My driveway faces 42 degrees east of North. At about even with Driveway, they moved Northward and began to rise or get smaller/dimmer.  I ran inside and called my wife who obsvered the same. As we watched the third of the trio disappear, three more followed the same sequence of events.  We moved to the front of the house and saw the last object, alone , come from the west towards us.  It moved at a nice speed then slowed as it also turned north and dimmed and moved away from us.  Our eight year old also witnessed the last four.  They were bright orange.  Just  as the last was going over a jet was passing over us, from our NW toSE. THERE WERE NO SIMILARITIES IN APPEARANCE.  I considered a flare but A flare would move with the wind ans not change direction.;40.6667161764706;-73.7018499999998
