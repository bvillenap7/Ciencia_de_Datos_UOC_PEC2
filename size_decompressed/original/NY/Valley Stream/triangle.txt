My cousin and I were looking at the stars smoking a cigarette after thanksgiving dinner...We saw a flash of light that lit up the sky like lightning but more blueish in color accompanied by an electrical crackle and sizzle kind of sound.The sky was very clear.Not a cloud.We were discussing this while still looking up looking at the plieades and then I noticed a triangle shaped black thing with the front edge of it slightly illuminated,I guess by the moon which was low in the sky.It was the front edge which we could see was rounded and a greyish metallic color-very faint- easy to miss-but it blocked out the stars as it passed under them.It moved very slow 5mph? It was hard to tell how high it was because of our angle of viewing.If it was 1000Ft. it was larger than a house if higher then it was massive.It moved off to the east as we stood there amazed....(We looked at eachother and said noone will ever believe us!) By the way neither of us were under the influence of any drugs or alcohol.we were stone cold sober.It made NO noise at all as it was passing,we believe the bright light was  from this thing because it came from the sky right before it appeared.I am a professional audio engineer and my cousin works at a hospital. this is no hoax.No exaggeration either.;40.6667161764706;-73.7018499999998
