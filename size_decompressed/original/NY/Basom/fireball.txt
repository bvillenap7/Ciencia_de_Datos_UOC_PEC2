fireball;2005-03-12 10:00:00;10 seconds;My girlfriend, her sister, and I were driving back from the supermarket. When i was talking to my girlfriend changing radio stations i noticed something out of the corner out of my eye. I said to my girlfriend what the heck is that thing and it was like a green fireball went by really slow then sped up. We all thought we were nuts til i got home later and i said man crazy stuff is happening to night. My mom says yea i was trying to get your father to come outside and see this green fireball. I said i saw the same thing. I do not know to this day if it was a ufo or something else but whatever it is now i sleep with the windows and the curtians close for the fear of seeing it again;43.0796;-78.3968
