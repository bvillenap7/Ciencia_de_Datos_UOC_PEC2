Multiple colored lights with erratic movements.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star.  PD));2011-10-06 22:00:00;1.5 hours +;Multiple colored lights with erratic movements I happened to look up while walking my dogs and noticed a very bright star that appeared to be moving.  Over the last hour and a half ive have 4 other people come over to comfirm that it is a light that changes color slowly from white to red to blue to green and more just slowly cycling (I noted that when it turned red it seemed to move faster and more eratically).  The light makes small and large zig zags, circles, and other random, fast, seemingly eratic movement but in a way that seems it knows where it is going.  I am still currently observing.  It has moved slightly up the horizon but has maintened a general area. Through binoculars, it also appears that the lights are in fact multiple different rings changing colors.  I  wish I had a nice telescope right about now... Wow! ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star.  PD));42.3047;-73.6552
