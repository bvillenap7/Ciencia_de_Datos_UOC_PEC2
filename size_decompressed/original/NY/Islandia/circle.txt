Moon like object passing sun and remaining to the right.;2008-02-02 13:00:00;30 seconds (?);Moon like object passing sun and remaining to the right. While looking for a parking spot at B.J.â€™s in Islandia, LI, N.Y. my daughter yelled for us all to look toward the sun. She saw what she assumed was the moon pass quickly in front the sun. By the time I looked, about 15 seconds later the moon like object was positioned to the right and lightly below the sun.  At first I thought, eclipse ? But I did not hear of any expected. We observed it for a few moments. It just sat there motionless. Clouds passed in front of both the sun and the object and it remained there.  I checked online to see if there was an eclipse and as I thought, there was not. Not to mention this object passed in front of the sun in a matter of 5 second.  She was the only one to see it pass in front of the sun. My self and my other daughter saw the object, as well as my other daughter, sitting there.  It was a mild day for February and partly cloudy. Macarthur Airport is approximately 8 mile east of this location.;40.8103;-73.1685
