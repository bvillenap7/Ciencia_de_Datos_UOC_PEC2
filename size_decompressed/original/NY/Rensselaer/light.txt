Light like expended firework display....no fireworks in the area per local PD.;2015-03-08 21:30:00;30;Light like expended firework display....no fireworks in the area per local PD. While out walking my dog, I saw a bright, stationary, light in the south western sky over the port of Albany, New York.  Thought at first was a star or an airplane.  Upon a closer look through binoculars, the light appeared to be subtly dimming and brightening, and also appeared to have subtle flashing red lights.   Suddenly, it appeared like a spent fireworks display with uneven and jagged smokey like tenticle like entrails.  The object appeared to be stationary and not moving.   I called the local PD who had no reports of a similar sighting.  I went out about an hour latter to walk my dog and saw the same object more in the north eastern horizon and there appeared to be a second similar object slightly south west of it.   There are lots of commercial aircraft that fly near here...Albany International Airport is about 10 miles from my house.  These were not airplanes!
