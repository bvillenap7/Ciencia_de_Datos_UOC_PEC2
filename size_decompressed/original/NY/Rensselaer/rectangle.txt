Eight lights in a rectangular formation.;2015-10-31 03:00:00;2 minutes;Eight lights in a rectangular formation I stopped just past an intersection, to take pictures of what I thought was a pretty sky.  I took several photos in sequence.  I didn't notice anything in particular.  When I looked at the pictures on my phone, I noticed a white spot in the sky.  I have a good phone, so I zoomed in on it.  It looks to be a series of lights.  Either 4 with a reflection off the cloud to look like 8, or actually 8 lights in a rectangluar formation.
