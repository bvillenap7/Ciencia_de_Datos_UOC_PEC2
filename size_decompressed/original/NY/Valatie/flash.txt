I was sitting at my Family's Labor Day Party, talking to someone.  All of a sudden, out of nowhere a bright blue-green-white steak started moving quickly across my Field of View parallel to the Ground, maybe a slight Pitch upward.  All of a sudden, it accelerated very quickly and disappeared  I looked like a slow-moving blueish-green Tracer Round, that is the only way I can describe the Color, except it was much larger and far off from us.  I then asked the Person i was talking to, Did you see that?  She said yes, but she was at a bad angle and just saw a bright white streak.;42.4357;-73.666
