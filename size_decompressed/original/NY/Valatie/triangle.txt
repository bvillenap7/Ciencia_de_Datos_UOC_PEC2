I was driving my truck when I saw a brilliant white light through the trees.  It was moving from roughly south to north intersecting my road.  I stopped the truck directly under its path.  What had at first appeared to be a single white light resolved into three headlights in a triangular pattern.  Also I could see that these lights were attached to a craft that looked something like a huge stealth fighter.  Totally silent.  Colored lights also on it. & what appeared to be windows. From the back it was completely dark. One week later at dusk I observed the brilliant white light near the same location, but very high up & it was being chased by 3 air force jets which could not catch it. The jets had visible contrails, the UFO had none. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.4357;-73.666
