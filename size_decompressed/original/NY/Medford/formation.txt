Similar to lights over Phoenix;1987-03-10 20:00:00;5 minutes;Similar to lights over Phoenix I recently saw a show on television featuring the Lights over Phoenix.  I have not heard of that phenomona prior to seeing the show.  I am writing because I saw the exact same lights phonomena over Medford Long Island New York in 1987 or perhaps it was 1986.  I was in the backl seat of a car heading north around 7:00 to approximately 8:30 pm when I noticed in the North Eastern Sky a formation of lights that appeared almost exactly as did the lights over phoenix.  However, the lights that I saw where slightly smaller.  There were approximately 5 - 10 and they were moving in unison.  I can't remember the exact time of day or even the month, but I never will forget it and how similar it was to the lights over phoenix.
