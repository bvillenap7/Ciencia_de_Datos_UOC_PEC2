Orange glowing oval sphere flying in fromation style;2012-07-21 21:55:00;8 minutes;Orange glowing oval sphere flying in fromation style We saw at least 20 orange glowing oval sphere's flying in the sky heading from the south to the north.  They traveled mostly two by two, formation style, very uniformed in shape size and speed with no sound.   There was a cloud that they floated into and disappeared.  With a plane you would see it appear on the other side.   We did see a few flashes of lights, not sure what they were.  One of the witnesses was on his way to work as an air traffic controller.  He called it in and was advised there were no planes in that vicinity and so many of them.  Every witness had the same reaction, nothing they have ever seen and truly a UFO.;40.8212;-72.9852000000001
