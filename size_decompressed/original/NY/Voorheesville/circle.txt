I was sitting on my living room couch and looked out of the bay window.  Through a large ash tree I saw a very bright orange glowing object that seemed to be getting closer.   I got up and opened my the front door and stepped out onto my front porch.  The object was still being partially blocked by the tree.  By the time I stepped out onto the sidewalk the object emerged from the tree cover and continued moving on a straight path, at a steady speed.   I called to my wife and son to come out to see.  The object had moved almost directly over myself and my home. It was emitting what seemed to be an orange glow or fire'  It did not appear to have any other shape as it moved west to east.    My son and I observed for about another 30 seconds as it moved father away, As it did it seemed to loose the intensity of it's glow.   A guess at its altitude would be 1,000 to 2,000 feet;42.6458;-73.9525
