Bright Orb dimmed , sped up and changed direction.;2017-09-04 20:43:00;15 seconds;Bright Orb dimmed , sped up and changed direction I was walking out of family dinner with my wife, and in this particular town outside the Albany, there is very little light pollution.  You are able to see much more of the night sky very clearly, so I always get lost looking when I'm out that way. As I walked outside and looked up, a flash caught my eye that seemed close, like a BRIGHT orb.  Just as fast as it flashed, it dimmed out and just looked like another star in the sky, except this started moving north at a very fast pace faster than you see normal aircraft move.  And it was very high, I'd say 50-60,000 feet up.    Then as I followed it, it stopped, reversed direction very quickly the way it had come, and disappeared.  This isn't the first time I've seen strange craft out that way, but this was the one I could best explain.   I'm hoping someone else saw this on that Monday night as well.  It's puzzled me because I have a pretty extensive knowledge of aircraft--and this thing did not move like any aircraft we have developed here;42.6458;-73.9525
