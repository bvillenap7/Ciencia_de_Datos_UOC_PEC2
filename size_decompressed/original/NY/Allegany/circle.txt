3 silver discs;2004-03-03 13:02:00;5 minutes;3 silver discs I was driving down the Four Mile rd. in Allegany on the way to class one warm afternoon in March when I happen to glance up in the sky and see three circular discs.  They were traveling in a straight line, one after another.  I watched them descend to my left, very slowly.  Because I was running behind, I couldn'd stay and watch, but I did get pictures.
