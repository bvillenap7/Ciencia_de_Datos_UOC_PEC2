Ball of light;1997-07-15 11:00:00;3 minutes;I was sitting in my living room watching Tv and my sister was around in the kitchen i hadnt taken drugs or anything if you are wondering drugs when i looked out the window off into the front yard when i saw an illuminating light coming down through the tall pine trees around the house. i was curious as to what it was knowing that it was way too bright and different than the moon. so i went off the front porch transfixed on a green bright glowing ball of light in the northeast part of the sky. as i got to the road i stood there staring at it..a big ball of light as it shifted up then down and danced around sort of and then zoomed off into the night sky and dissappeared. that night it was impossible to get to sleep and i was disturbed by its randomness. till this day it brings a wierd chill to my body when i tell the story and i try to explain the expirience to people and so i want to see if there are any similar expiriences out there like this.;42.0906;-78.5021
