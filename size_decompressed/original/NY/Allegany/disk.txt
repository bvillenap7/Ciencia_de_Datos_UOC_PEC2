U.F.O. sighting over the Allegany river in New York.;2009-08-05 23:30:00;20 minutes;U.F.O. sighting over the Allegany river in New York. We were with several people at a campgroung on the Allegany river near the Allegany state forest between Steamburg and Salamanca New York. This object has been sighted several times this year. Our friends have seen it at least five times and told us about it. We have been there a handful of times this year and it wasn't until this last trip that we actually got to see it first hand. It was between 11pm and 12am that my friends wife pointed out a star or planet that was changing colors when all of a sudden we saw a huge bright yellow orange and very bright object come up over the treeline and traveled maybe a couple hundreds until it was almost over the top of us. It stopped for about 2 or three minutes then it started moving at a 90 degree anlge in a different direction. We watched it while I struggled to put batteries in my camera. I managed to take pictures but it was pretty far away at that point. After it disapeared and we were all standing around talking about it I glanced up and noticed something behind the trees (at the skyline) I drew everyone's attention to the fact and here it came again! It could have been a second one. I took more pictures. When we returned home I downloaded our pictures from the weekend and three of them turned out! They are not crystal clear because of the brightness of the object but You can clearly make out the shape and color. I was listening to the recording of the astronaughts on Atlantis who saw something this year and described it as being made of a soft looking reflective material which could explain the color of the object we saw reflecting the glow of the campfires throughout the area.;42.0906;-78.5021
