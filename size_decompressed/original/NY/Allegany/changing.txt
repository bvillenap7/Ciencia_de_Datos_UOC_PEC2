Object in the sky;2002-03-23 11:07:00;ten minutes;Object in the sky I was driving down the road (the 4 mile Rd.) about 11AM and I happened to look up in the sky and see an object with a bit of jet stream behind it heading to my right.  At first, it was silver, but a few seconds later, it was creamish colored and kinda blurry around it.  Then the jet stream disappeared and the object floated and then floated back across the sky to my left.  I was watching it for about five minutes because I was late for meeting with my mother and I was able to take three pictures of it, but they are not developed yet.  There was also an airplane (100% sure) in the sky way above it also.;42.0906;-78.5021
