I was outside with my husband in our backyard when we look at the sky and I started observing a triangular object thing from the east, color dark orange moving really slow towards north location. Above this object there was a small light (it looked like a star moving slowly acompaning the orange shaped thing). As soon it dissapeared, we also saw two more coming from the east a little far from the first one but going in the same direction. As soon we saw them dissapear, two more showed up from the same direction going north, like they were all going towards the same direction. It was partly cloudy, they definetely did not look like planes, color: dark orange , shape: triangle, they were silent, moving slowly.;41.0566;-73.8128
