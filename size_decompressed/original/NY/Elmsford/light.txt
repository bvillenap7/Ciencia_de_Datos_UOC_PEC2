Large bright purple/blue hovering light;2021-03-10 21:10:00;3 minutes;Large bright purple/blue hovering light I was driving on the Taconic State Parkway in Westchester County, New York. I noticed an unnaturally bright purple/blue light/glow in the sky on my left which I guess must have been coming from the West since I was northbound. I recorded with my phone as best I could since I was driving but even before I watched the video, I could tell that it wasnâ€™t coming from a light source on the ground. I eventually lost sight of it so I assume it took off during the moments in which the sky was blocked by trees or buildings;41.0566;-73.8128
