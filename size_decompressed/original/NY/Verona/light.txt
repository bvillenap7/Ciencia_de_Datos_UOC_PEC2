3 light ufos over central ny;2011-07-04 23:45:00;10+ minutes;3 light ufos over central ny I and my mother where able to observe 3 seperate craft moving in odd directions, crisscrossing in singular spots and not near eachother.  One was in one point of the sky, and each was approximately 40 degrees away from each other in the sky from our position.   While two where mostly stationary, one which we saw first continued to move in patterns as if having issues maintaining its point.  This one also seemed to change colors occasionally white, red, and green.   My mother says that she can see at least one nightly, and wanted to show me.   I remained watching for about ten minutes before going back inside as they seemed as if they'd be there awhile.  They were high in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.
