ufo sighting in central ny;2005-12-21 18:00:00;1-3 minutes;ufo sighting in central ny At about 5:45 pm eastern time, we witnessed at 1st what looked like 2 large yellow lights in the sky. we thought it was possibly a plane getting ready to either land or just taking off.  we were not anywhere close enough to an airport for a plane to be that low.  As i drove up over a bridge we continued to watch it. about 2 minutes later, it became clearer  to see what shape it was.  it was a disk shape and you could see numerous lights going around the craft.  it was exactly what you would see on tv.  i pulled over to watch it and it then only showed 2 white lights, with 2 flashing red lights on each end. withen seconds it disappered. i am not a believer in ufo's or aliens, but what i did see looked exactly like a ufo!!;43.1437;-75.582
