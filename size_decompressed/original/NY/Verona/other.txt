figure 8 in the sky  ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.  PD));2004-08-31 20:30:00;15 mins;figure 8 in the sky we watched a fog looking light  in the  shape of a figure 8 move across the sky  outside our barn ... at first we thought it was a plane in the clouds  but after looking things over we think it was a ufo ... 1. there was no clouds in the sky ...it was perfectly clear out 2.the craft moved very slowly across the sky as if it was watching something ... it faded in and out and as it faded out it looked like 2 headlights shining threw the fog  but as it got brighter it looked like 2 headlights hooked together shining threw the fog... there was no fog, clouds or any thing like that in the sky ... as for size  it was huge  at least 4 times the size of a jet (747)it was moving north very slowly ( a little faster then a huvor)...as for the position in the  sky  we were looking at the big dipper  and we followed the handle  to the end   following the same direction  out a ways (maybe 2 hands) is where we saw it .. we watched  it for  about  15 mins  and decided to go get a camera  but when we returned it was gone ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.
