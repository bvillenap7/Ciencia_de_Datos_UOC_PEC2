UFO sighting Verona NY November 10, 2010;2010-11-10 17:45:00;1 minute;UFO sighting Verona NY November 10, 2010 I was driving down the road when I saw two light lights with a red light in the center of them. I asked myself what it could be and assumed it was a water tower or something of the like. I turned north bound on the small back road just past blackmans corner rd. when I saw the lights again. As I continued to drive I noticed the lights were coming towards me. I said to myself this is not normal and pulled off to the side of the road. I got out of my car and walked behind it. The object was Diamond shaped about 15 feet long by 15 feet across. It was approximately 25 feet  off the ground and only about 25- 30 feet right of me. It traveled roughly 25-30 mph across the length of the field parallel the road.  It made a light humming noise.  Though the lights on it were some what distorting my view of it I could see the shape perfectly.  I could tell it was made of a metal of some kind. It almost looked bronze underneath with the lights reflecting off it.  It had two white lights, one on either side and a red light at the front of it. I am a logical person. I do not even like Star Track but I know what I saw was nothing that could be described as anything we commonly know. Three cars drove by me as I stood there looking at the object so I am sure someone else must have seen it.;43.1437;-75.582
