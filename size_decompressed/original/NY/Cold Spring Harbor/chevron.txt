Large, wide, low-flying, very light object with navigational lights observed over road.;2006-11-30 19:00:00;2 -3 minutes;Large, wide, low-flying, very light object with navigational lights observed over road. My husband was driving by the Uplands Farm Sanctuary in Cold Spring Harbor (NY) on Thursday evening, November 30, 2006 at about 7:30 p.m.   He saw over the road a large object, more wide than long, larger than a jet airplane, shaped like a V, with navigational lights in green and white.   It was flying low and moving very slowly and he said it had to be lighter than air in order to achieve the type of movement he observed.   He got out of his vehicle and watched for several minutes.  He heard a whirring sound, unlike typical mechanical sounds we are accustomed to.  Another car drove by but did not stop.  He has felt very sick since that time, with a malaise he cannot specify, and he has an unexplained, fairly deep scratch on his upper back. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she sounded quite serious-minded to us.  We suspect that she is a very good witness, and reporter of fact.  PD));40.8588;-73.4502
