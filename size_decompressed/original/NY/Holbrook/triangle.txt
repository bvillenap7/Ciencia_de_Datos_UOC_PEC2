Very large;2007-07-27 23:30:00;2 minutes;A large triangular shaped object with a large red light on the underside and three large circular white lights on the rear. Very large I was at a friend's house when I was on my way outside, through the back doors and I stopped and saw a red light in the sky. When my eyes focused I saw that it looked to be the size of a very large house. it seemed about 2 to 3 houses away. It was completely silent.  It looked like a child's block toy - a three dimensional isosceles triangle with large, circular lights some white ones in the rear and one red one on the underside of the craft. It was cruising rather slowly when I called my friend to come and see it. It was heading west when it passed behind some tall trees and should have come out on the opposite side but when I got to where I should've been able to see it, it was gone.

I was traveling on Inverness Dr. in Holbrook, NY, at about 1:00 AM, on 6/21/17.   It moved faster then anything I have ever seen.  It created a dull light that wavered in intensity, possibly a vapor trail.  It possibly was a comet - but it looked like no other comet I have ever seen.  After about 5 seconds moving on a straight path, it vanished.;40.7963;-73.0665
