Lights over the Shawangunk Mountain Range.;2011-06-30 23:30:00;up to 5 minutes;Lights over the Shawangunk Mountain Range. Our deck faces the Shawangunk Mountain range in NY.  In the summer months we spend a lot of time outside at night and witness strange lights in the sky.  One night in 2011, the light seemed to be getting larger and larger as we watched it and it indeed appeared to be getting closer.  It seemed to be over our yard eventually and shining the light right on us.  All of a sudden it was gone.  It was an amazing experience. On another evening we had company over and were outside on the deck again when the lights appeared.  This time, there were 2 lights.  Our guests were going insane and my husband and I had to explain that this happens all the time over this mountain range.  The lights seemed to be dancing when all of a sudden, once again, they were gone. It is not only during the summer months we see them.  One of our bedroom windows also looks out onto the mountain range and I see the lights often, dancing in the sky over the mountain, as I lay there at night trying to sleep. On one afternoon while standing at the top of our long driveway for our daughters school bus, I also witnessed 4 objects in the sky in the opposite direction of the mountain range.  They were silvery looking and almost shaped like a sombrero. they appeared in the sky one at a time and moved around a bit then disappeared as they appeared, one at a time.  There has been a lot of activity in this area for as long as I've lived here (23 years).  Not just over the mountain range, but all around the community here.  I've never reported anything for fear of being ostracized and thought of as crazy.  However, with more and more of my friends, family and neighbors talking about things they witness, I feel much more at ease discussing it now.;41.6507;-74.102
