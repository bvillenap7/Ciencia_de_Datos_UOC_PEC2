Saucer shaped disc surrounded by brilliant light;2005-02-25 21:30:00;10 minutes;Saucer shaped disc surrounded by brilliant light I observed a strange disc shaped object in the distance.  Moving north to south. Moving at an excelerated speed.  I was able to view this object for a period of 5 minutes when I was able to grab my digital camera.  I used the max setting for distance and took a picture.  To my surprise and shock I was able to have the camera record detail that my eye was unable to see. The best way to describe what was photogrphed is to picture an egg sunny side up, slightly tilted in the pan.  My camera caught what appears to be a saucer shaped disc with a concentrated black inner circle that appears to be atop the disc.  But the amazing detail is that it is surrounded by a brilliant white albumen that engulfs the saucer.  This white albumen was not visible to  my eye.  Upon relaying my sighting to my group of friends, I was told that my coworkers son also viewed something in the sky that night and refused to go to bed.  He swears that it was not a plane or any known craft. To see the picture speaks volumes of what I witnessed.;40.6327000000001;-73.6333
