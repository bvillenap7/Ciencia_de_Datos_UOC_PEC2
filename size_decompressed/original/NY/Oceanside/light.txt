Single craft later observed I was sitting outside in my backyard, when I saw 2 bright orange lights flying in an arc, a set distance from one another.  They were travelling fairly slow, almost as if they were observing.  As they got closer to the horizon, they disappeared.   I was screaming for someone to come outside.  My father came outside in time to see the third (supposed, my father said) craft.  He believes it is an airplane, but I spend enough time outside to know that aircrafts have blinking lights.   I've seen strange things before, but this made me truly question my sanity. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
