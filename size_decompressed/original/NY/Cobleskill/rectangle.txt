Rectangular UFO sighting above cavernous mountains, Cobleskill NY;2014-09-01 12:00:00;1 minute;Rectangular UFO sighting above cavernous mountains, Cobleskill NY I remember in 2014, I didn’t have a phone to take a picture of what I saw but I was in the car as a passenger on I-88 towards Cobleskill, NY. Near the mountains by Howe Caverns, in the sky, there was a rectangular giant object, either a dark grey or black color, way bigger than an airplane just hovering in the sky. We were stopped because of traffic and it would not move, and definitely was floating. I tried researching to find if UFO’s were shaped rectangular and couldn’t find anything at the time but just found this article of so many encounters with a rectangular UFO in the sky, in upstate NY around the exact same week I saw it.;42.6822000000001;-74.4889999999998
