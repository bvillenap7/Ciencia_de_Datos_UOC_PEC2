Saw what appeared to be a star on fire.  Flames lasted between 15-25 seconds before stopping and star like shape went from bright to dull orange, almost disappearing, and it began to move very slowly at first to the east.  As it moved (not erratically), it began picking up speed, and I saw what I first thought must be something on my eye, like one of those floaters’, but it was this thing that was moving.  It looked like a wing, just one, not horizontal but vertical.  It was shaped like a moths wing, flat along the lower (bottom?) and smaller and slightly rounded on the top.   I could see the outline, but it looked opaque, and somehow it was illuminated, but not with any spot type lights.  It was almost fiber optic like.  It was also picking up a lot of speed by now (approximately 45 seconds to a minute in now) and heading east toward Duanesburg and Schoharie.   I no longer noticed any particular point of light on it, just that it gave off a very low light.  It didn’t seem to reflect it, and I could clearly see the outline.  The light seemed to concentrate subtly  within this wing like outline, but I can’t find the words to describe it.  It almost seemed mist like, but defined.  VERY FAST.  No sound, and it disappeared from view, because of the trees in my yard.;42.6822000000001;-74.4889999999998
