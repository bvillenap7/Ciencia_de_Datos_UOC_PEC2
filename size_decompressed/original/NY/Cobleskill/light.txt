Looking east, low in the sky, a bright orange circular figure was just sitting there.;1997-03-30 00:45:00;4 minutes;Looking east, low in the sky, a bright orange circular figure was just sitting there. It was back when Hale-Bopp was around, and my mom and I went out front to view it and we saw this circular orange thing.  I was younger and didn't really understand what it was, but now that I know what a comet is, I know that what we saw was not a comet.  We viewed it for about 5 minutes.   It was low in the sky and was bright orange.  It was like it was the sun, but smaller.  Well we ended up goin in the backyard, and finally saw hale-bopp. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));42.6822000000001;-74.4889999999998
