Star takes off;2004-10-18 16:45:00;5 min;Star takes off As I was driving home from work in Southampton I noticed a bright light in the sky. It was a beautiful clear day and I thought it was odd that a star would be so bright so early. It looked like a helicopeter with a spotlight on but it was staying stationary. It was southwest of my location and with all the trees along the road I would lose site of it periodically. As I drove past a clearing that is along the Shinnecock Bay I couls clearly see it and I slowed down to try to get a better look. It was in my clear sight for about 30 seconds when it shot to the north west faster than anything I've ever seen and was gone. It didn't seem real at the time and I didn't say anything to anyone. About a week later I was laying in bed with my wife when a show on tv about UFO's was on. I turned to my wife and started telling her about what I saw and before I could finish she had described the very same thing, but she has seen it over the summer. On your site I see a lot of similar descriptions and I felt I should include mine. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.8699999999999;-72.5231

They seemed to be traveling at slightly different speeds.  They first appeared in the south just a little above the horizon.  They traveled east and vanished about 25 degrees above the horizon SSE. No sounds were heard.  Sky was quite overcast.  These lights were about 3 to 4 times brighter than the lights on a passing airplane.  Lights were colored a redish/orange.  At one point 5 could be seen in the sky at the same time.  Over 15 were seen through the 15 minute period.;40.8699999999999;-72.5231
