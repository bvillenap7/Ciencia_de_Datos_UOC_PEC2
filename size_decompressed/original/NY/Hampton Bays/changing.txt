Big orange orb moving just above the tree tops along the beach coast (West to East). The movement looked as if it were riding ripples of a wave. Very low in the sky. When it got to be directly in front of me (over the Hampton Bays Coast Guard Station and less than a mile away) , two additional orbs appeared simultaneously behind it forming an elongated triangle. An additional orange orb from the ocean side and a red orb from land side. It then moved in formation as an elongated triangle through the treetops out over the ocean. Could not have been more than a couple hundred feet up and never made a sound.;40.8699999999999;-72.5231
