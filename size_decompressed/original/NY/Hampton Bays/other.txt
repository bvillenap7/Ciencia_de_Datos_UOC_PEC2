PD));2009-12-21 19:50:00;10 seconds;Black, crescent shaped object with four dim lights raced across the sky. So me and my mother were in our hot tub watching the planes go by. After all them went by something with four orange, faint lights seemed to materialize out of the miidle of the night sky and arc across the southeastern portion of the sky.  It had four orange lights that were spread out in an arc, but you could see they were connected to a dark body the was shaped like a cresent with two tails on each back end. It made no sound and was going at a significant speed.  It looked just above the treeline but was definetly bigger then any other pllane I've ever seen. During that moment we saw it, there were no other planes in the vicinity, then they appeared right after so whatever it was didn't want to be seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.
