PD));2016-01-31 13:00:00;4 seconds;Last Sunday, January 31st, 2016, one of my workers was out with his wife, sun, and a friend driving in Hampton Bay, NY, on Long Island.  They decided to take a video of them crossing one of the largest bridges in the area.  That night once they got home, he looked at the video and noticed something strange that was caught on the video. It appears the he caught a UFO shooting out of the water possible doing a barrel roll then the object proceeds to fly somewhat tords them, then makes a slight correction and heads straight to them and lowers something from the bottom of the craft while flying past them. Iâ€™m including the full video uncut.  You will see the object appear at 36 seconds on the video lasting 4 seconds in total. ((NUFORC Note:  Bird in flight.  PD));40.8699999999999;-72.5231
