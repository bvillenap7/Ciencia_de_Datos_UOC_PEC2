Me and my mother were sitting in our hot tub, and we were looking at all this feint white dots just cruising across the night sky.   They were a dull white and about as big as a star, but we thought they might bve an aircraft at a high altitude since there was no sound and no abnormal flight patterns.  We then saw an aircraft that seemed to appear by the northern horizon and fly over us at a steady, slow speed (about 100-300 mph?)to the southern horizon before disappearing.  It was a triangular shape with three red light at each point, they didn't blink.  It was odd because the aircraft made no sound and it seemed that the flat side was facing the direction it was flying, not the point or tip of the plane, like how a plane flies.  After it passed (about 10 seconds) we did not see any other objects like it nor those small white lights (that were also flying at the same speed and direction) in the sky.  We think it might be a type of stealth bomber, because som! e of its characteristics match the UFO, and we also live close to an air base.  If you can tell us of any stealth bombers in the area that night it would be greatly appreciated.;40.8699999999999;-72.5231
