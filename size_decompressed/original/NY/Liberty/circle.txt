While driving with two other people, saw a strange light in the sky.;1999-11-27 21:23:00;2 seconds;While driving with two other people, saw a strange light in the sky. At 9:23 PM (est) on Rt 17 West by Liberty NY, USA on 11/27/99, I was driving along with two other people. We all witnessed a bright white light going west bound over the Catskill Mountains moving parallel with Rt 17 at extremely high velocity.  I was wondering if any body else saw the same thing in the area at that time.  Or if any one saw anything like it any where else at that time.  Any responses would be appreciated.;41.7969;-74.7525999999998
