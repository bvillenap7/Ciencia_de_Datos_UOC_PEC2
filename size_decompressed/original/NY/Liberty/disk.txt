It was about 3:00am on 6/29/08 and me and to friends watched an object with yellow lights gyrating around it. Every time I tried to take a picture with my phone it would disappear then re appear a few seconds later. Then it disappeared for a few seconds then re appeared half way across the sky. Evey 20 mins or so it would emit a red/orange glow that would only last maybe a 1/2 a second then stop. The object also never stayed in just one spot in the sky it hovered moving in a triangular pattern. We finally went inside because we thought it was watching us and it kind of scared us. Ever since I have been having strange dreams.;41.7969;-74.7525999999998
