Obj reccurring around nights sky, high speeds, instant stops, projecting other objects around it.  ((anonymous report));2019-08-31 09:00:00;Repeating;Object reoccurring around nights sky, high speeds, instant stops, projecting other objects around it while running its course. Around the same time every night I stargaze, recently this month my son has been waking up to tell me that said owls have been outside our house.  It didn't catch my attention at first (imagination), but, until I noticed that a ufo has been flying around the open view outside my house.  I have a window that can see open field for miles and this ufo what have you... moves around the sky until I cannot watch anymore.  It has shown characteristics of circling, brightening and dimming.  When planes are in the vicinity of flight path it will dim its lights and fly higher into the sky.  It will wait until out of path to come further down then lighting back up.  I have seen said ufo move quickly around nights sky and take what looks like sharp 45 degree angles just to stop instantaneously brighten up and what appears to be letting out orbs of lights from said object.
