Saw 3 orange round lights motionless,change shapes and move eratically ,vanish and reappear.Have video;2008-05-15 22:00:00;45 minutes;Saw 3 orange round lights motionless,change shapes and move eratically ,vanish and reappear.Have video What I witnessed was not any conventional aircraft that I am aware of.I was sitting on my balcony which is located on Erie Canal. Lake Ontario is about 8 miles north of where i was sitting. I looked out toward a blinking red light toward the lake I know to be a metal tower light. As i gazed at it, 2 bright orange lights suddenly appeared. They did not move at all and were positioned right next to each other. As i watched,I began to realize this was something unusual.then a third light appeared and all three repositioned in a split second to what may have been a mile apart from each other.Then they were gone in a blink of an eye. I ran into the house about 200 feet from my barn where i was sitting. I grabbed my video recorder and came back. The following I recorded at separate intervals as they vanished and reappeared several times.  After about 3 more minutes, they reappeared. Now they were moving slowly side by side and then one over the other when they split apart and separated in what was only a fraction of a second and again were now a mile apart from each other.they sat there perfectly still,almost erie still with no motion at all. Then, one of them began to alter its round shape into what appeared to be 3 triangles with light shooting out from between them.the amber color remained steady throughout.The triangles appeared dimmer than the center light source.After about 45 minutes to 1 hour, they were gone.Again, I have the footage on my JVC video recorder. the Recorder is only 2 months old and is in perfect working condition.I have seen two other UFO crafts in my life.One over my home as a young boy,and the other over my workplace in buffalo NY on august 2 12:20 am 2000.The latter was a 1,000 foot craft with red and white lights. It had a black rail structure and was shaped like a giant eye.This craft was enormous and moved without sound.Vanished one light at a time.;43.2212999999998;-78.3855000000002
