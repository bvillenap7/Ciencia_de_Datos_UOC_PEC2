From 1 pm to 5 pm these objects slowly appear as round masses from a far away distance.  As they come closer they for a rectangle shape.  There is movement and lights flashing on the objects.  At one time 2 of them joined side by side. My camera is a night vision camera and these objects are not visible with the human eye.  These all take place during the day and there are usually between 7-9 of them.  My camera is mounted at my bedroom window on the second floor and pointed at the sky 24/7.
