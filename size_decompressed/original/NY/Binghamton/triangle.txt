Black, triangular, eary glow around the object;2012-08-07 22:00:00;15;Black, triangular, eary glow around the object I was on my way home from work and at first I thought it was just a star formation in the sky,  then I took a longer look at and around the object. I could clearly see stars around the object but when I looked inside the object, all I saw was pitch blackness and no stars.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
 I looked up I seen three triangles a triangular formation.;2018-06-12 22:10:00;Split second;I was looking down at my phone walking down the sidewalk.  Of the corner of my eye I seen an orange light.  When I looked up I seen three triangles a triangular formation. It looked like the Zelda triforce.  It was an orangish red color but more on the orange side.  It shot off really quick and left a light trail like when you move a flashlight really quick.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
