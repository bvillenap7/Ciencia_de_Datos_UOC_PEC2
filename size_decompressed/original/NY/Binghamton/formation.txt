There were 2 groupings of 4 orange lights that within each grouping would cross over one another. It appeared to be a cyclic pattern, but once they were closer to being over head, there was the same pattern of movement over and over. It took only 30 seconds or so for the crafts (or whatever) to go from one horizon to the other. As they got further away, and closer to the opposite horizon, they took an immediate 90 degree turn, without slowing and rapidly sped out of viewable sight. My brother and I witnessed this. We could make out no craft only the lights. The odd part about this was that they were no more than 300 to 400 yards above us. Another interesting observatyion that my brother brought to light was the fact that there were no clouds in the sky before we noticed these objects. Upon reeling from what we had both just witnessed, we realized that there were now thick clouds on the original horizon, and fog was now moving in . Very wierd. I do not think that this is anything more han coincidence, but thought I would state the fact. Let me say for the record that I mearly beleive that the possibility for other life in the universe could exist. After that event, I beleive that it does. At least something does.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
3 redish lights traveling in parallel south to north over binghamton;2012-03-13 23:00:00;8 sec;3 redish lights traveling in parallel south to north over binghamton letting the dogs out Tuesday night, I was gazing up at the wonderful clear sky, I noticed a moving object to the south..pinkish/red..  I thought it was a sattelite, it was moving faster than a plane..and not blinking.  I'll say I noticed it at about 9 oclock relative to the sky, at about 11 oclock relative to sky it was joined by a second object..same color moving parallel to each other, at about 1 oclock relative to sky it was joined by a 3rd..all 3 moving side by side..at about the 2 oclock position, the light on the outside right swerved in towards the middle light..the middle light swerved as a reaction(my guess) then all 3 went back into formation.  all this happened in about 8 seconds..from south horizon to north horizon...no plane goes that fast nor do sattlites ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
