rolling, changing color & shape,silent,bluesky;1998-04-13 07:00:00;3 min;rolling, changing color & shape,silent,bluesky I was parked in my car on a side street waiting to go to work, the sky was very clear & blue. there was no motion on this street at the time. I look at the sky alot .. I looked up & to my left & noticed what appeared to be a crumpled piece of white paper moving along at a moderate( and steady) speed heading almost directly away from me. it held my intrest. as this thing moved away I noticed it was going at a steady speed and in a directly strait line, I then noticed there was NO wind at all so my flying garbage theory was shot. when I first saw it it was bright white& about the size of a big crumpled newspaper @ 40FT. as it moved away I saw that it was becoming more of a metalic shiny color. this is when I noticed it seemed to be... (no, it WAS)  CHANGING SHAPE. it was a multi sided object the shape is nothing i can discribe.. it had corners & flat spots & appeared to be rolling forward.  the course it took was straight & methodical. as it got farther away it looked very shiny & metalic it continued to roll forward untill it was out of sight. there was no one else around to witness it, & it was completley silent. sure wish I'd had my camera. I am interested to know if anyone else has seen similar.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497

While going east to west in Binghamton, I was watching what appeared to be a twin engine military transport type plane make circles over the valley by Broome Community College, and Otsiningo Park by the Binghamton/Port Dickinson line.  It was spewing thick black exhasut only intermitantly as it flew.  To note the plane was only 1000 ft above the city.  After about 10-15 minutes of this, it flew off towards the NW over Endwell and Maine, NY. This is becoming a frquent occurance. The plane is usually grey with no symbols, tail color, or numbers on it.  Once it was seen as white with an orange tail.  I find these colors to be very peculiar.  About a year and a half ago, I saw this plane do the same thing even lower over the city.  It was a warm day, and I had the window open.  It was spewing out the same thick smoke.  After a little while, I started to have throat iratation, and sinus pain.  Very unusal for me.  Is anyone else seeing this? Please let the world know.  By the way, this plane comes around whenever there is UFO activity in the area like Bainbridge and Vestal in the last month.  Also, when this plane is around, there are no other aircraft in the sky, and Binghamton is 5 miles from a regularly used airport that services major cities.

upstate NY sighting;2006-08-06 20:00:00;2 minute;upstate NY sighting I think I could probably draw it easier than describe it - what caught my attention was the lights coming downward in our direction - i saw it thru the window while we watched a movie. It was going really slow - and the lights were (i believe) blue & white. I went outside & looked at it & heard NO NOISE at all! and even though it appeared to be going slow - it covered a large distance in just a couple minutes it was out of sight. Imagine a hammerhead shark - the wings were curved like a partial C, and then the tail part was very very short. The wings looked ot be 4 times as long as the little stub of a tail. the lights alternated, one color then the other. It may have been green & blue - very bright. I went outside thinking it was a plane of some sort, and we do have lockheed martin & other military contracter factory -type places, but after seeing it I didnt think it was a plane at all. There was no electrical problems/interruptions - but the satellite went out - as it has been a lot with no weather conditions to cause it. If you want to talk to me let me know & if i miss the call i can call you back (no need for collect call).;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497

Bright green streak;2021-02-26 20:30:00;Less then 5 seconds;Bright green streak Traveling on NY-17W approx 1030pm there was a bright green light that appeared in the sky. It went downwards and to the left in a streak form, then disappeared. It was dark out with a very clear night sky. There were 6 other cars on the highway and every one of us saw something and hit our brakes. The light was almost blinding bright.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
