Fleet of metalic objects over Binghamton N.Y.;2014-03-31 04:00:00;10 minutes;Fleet of metalic objects over Binghamton, N.Y.. My 5 year old daughter and I observed what at first seemed to be flock of birds moving east to west over the southern end of downtown Binghamton, N.Y.   There were 20 to 30 of these objects flying together and repeatedly transitioning from a v formation to a w then spreading away from each other into a cloud.   These object were metallic and highly reflective against the blue sky.   The time was around 4 pm and the sun was low and opposite to the part of the sky the objects were flying in.   The individual objects themselves seemed to be like a rounded chevron, with the rounded end facing forward though being at a distance of a few thousand feet it was hard to tell for sure.  These objects remained visible for ten or fifteen minutes then our view was obstructed by buildings.  We tried to walk to a better vantage point but could not locate the objects after that. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and see seemed to us to be a quite sober-minded individual.  We suspect that he is a highly reliable witness.  PD));42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
