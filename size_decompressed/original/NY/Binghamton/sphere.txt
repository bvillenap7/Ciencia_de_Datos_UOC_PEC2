A red sphere glowing object that moved extremely fast from place to place, hovered over the house, and then disappeared in a second.;1998-08-01 00:00:00;5 minutes;A red sphere glowing object that moved extremely fast from place to place, hovered over the house, and then disappeared in a second. The sky was very clear.  I walked out of my parent’s home to get on my new motorcycle.  I went to place my helmet on and happened to turn around to see if the door at the house was closed.  As soon as I turned around I saw this hovering red glowing oblect (a very bright and dimming light).  It was about 50 yards away from the house on the right hand side.  The view of this object put me into serious shock...I was scared to death because it came down straight down towards the house (I was hiding behind my parent’s vehicle).  It then flew very fast to the left of the house and was again in a dead stop.  It then shot onto the top of the mountain for 5 to 10 seconds and back again to the same position that it was when I first saw it while it was glowing on and off.  What I saw, I could not handle the scare it gave me. As soon as stood up behing the car, the object shot into the sky in a second and disappeared. I called the binghamton airport to ask if the was any airplanes, helicopters, or any objects flying around midnight. The airport told me that there was nothing flying in the vicinity of binghamton at all.  It did not look like anything I have ever seen or thought existed.  This object made no sound the whole time. I reported this by phone the morning after it happened to the Seattle UFO reporting center. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Sphere heads north, turns, and then goes up!;2003-10-13 20:00:00;30 seconds;Sphere heads north, turns, and then goes up! My son and I were leaving to get in our car at a downtown business, when all of the sudden my son asked if a bright object was Mars.  I said no, because Mars was in the southern sky, and this light was towards the north.  We watched the object about 70 degrees above the horizon go in a straight line for north.  Then, it made a curve towards the North-east (at 45 degrees above the horizon) , faded out like it was going higher into the atmosphere.  This was not a satelite since it started at a dead stop.  It was not a plane, since it had no wing blinking lights, and the object was too far up for that. The object was a pure white, no yellow.  It was a sphere and only dimmed in intensity as it curved and head to higher altitudes until it was a tiny point, and kept going until other buildings obscured the view. This sight was only 3 miles form Johnson City where another report was recently made.  Is the southern tier of NY becoming UFO central? ((NUFORC Note:  The International Space Station flew over the area in question, but at 19:25 hrs. on this date, and it would have been in the west and the south.

Stationary sphere.;2013-06-15 15:15:00;2 minutes;Stationary sphere. Looking NE in the sky, I saw a silver metallic sphere, many miles up.  It stayed perfectly still.  Planes even flew near it, but it did not move.  2 minutes later, it just disappeared.  It was a partly sunny day.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
