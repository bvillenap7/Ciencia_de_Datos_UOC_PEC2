I came out to witness what at first looked like a star but after watching it blinked lights at first white but than would turn all red it was moving but only to the left a little than returning back to It's original spot the lights looked like 3 sets above a set of 4 lights making a total of 7 lights after watching for a bit we noticed an another object to the left of the other coming up and moving slowly at first we thought an airplane but this wasnt the case this triangle shaped object had dim red lights about 5 total with a very faint white glow around them it moved really slowly after we noticed another object this time with 5 lights that all blinked simultaneously a bright white it moved slowly I only had my iPhone present and my camera didn't touch what we were seeing I wanted to wait longer to see if the first initial object would eventually move along with the rest but for the next 10 minutes it sat there I had to give up because i had work in the morning this isn't the first sighting in our area just 2 weeks before our news broadcasted 2 other individuals who reported seeing peculiar objects in the sky I was pretty intrigued by these objects I just wished a professional could have seen them hope this was helpful to anyone who feels they have seen what I saw Thank you!;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
