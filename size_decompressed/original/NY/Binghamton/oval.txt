Unknown craft moving over Binghamton;2012-01-02 22:00:00;10 min;Unknown craft moving over Binghamton At approximately 10 PM, a bright light was noticed above the horizon. It appeared to be still, but it became apparent that it was approaching us at a very slight angle. As it approached, we noticed that it made no sound, and was moving very slowly, so we assumed it had to be proceeding at a high elevation. However, at its closest, we noticed that it was close enough for the silhouette to be visible, and not only was it not a recognizable plane, but it did not appear to have wings. It seemed to be only a short distance above the treetops, not much larger than a large van, and had blinking lights around its edges. Since we were driving, we turned when it passed, but it seemed to accelerate beyond the trees and over the horizon before we could follow it.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
