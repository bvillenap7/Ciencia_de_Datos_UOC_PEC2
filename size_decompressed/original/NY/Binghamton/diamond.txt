Object with rapidly flashing lights gliding through night sky silently over Binghamton,NY;2013-06-05 22:05:00;3 minutes;Object with rapidly flashing lights gliding through night sky silently over Binghamton,NY On the evening of June 5, 2013, at 10:05 pm my adult daughter and I observed an oddly moving flying craft with several strobe lights rapidly flashing--one was red and others were white.  Flashing was very bright and continuous.   Object moved quite rapidly across the sky, overhead and slightly to the south.  It moved from east to west,northwest.  It appeared closer than a commercial jet but made no sound whatsoever.  It made a gliding /floating type of drift through the sky but was definitely propelled forward quite rapidly.   The night sky was calm and clear, stars were visible.  We watched the object for about 2 - 3 minutes.  Flashing remained consistent as did the direction and speed of the object.  The movement reminded me of a helicopter, however, the lack of any sound was not consistent with a helicopter.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
Diamond shaped object with 5 fireballs on each point.;2015-10-11 07:30:00;10;Diamond shaped object with 5 fireballs on each point. The object had 5 Orange fireballs on each point of the diamond..it was slowly moving and went over the trees.  We thought we were done but then a small object appears with 2 Fireballs and then another one.  It's possible that the larger one object may have split apart to couple.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
