FL340 40NM South of KBGM;2006-02-22 00:20:00;4 min;FL340 40NM South of KBGM While Flying at FL340 (34000) Westbound on a flight plan from KLGA to KMCI (New York, LGA Airport to Kansas City, MCI) performing duties associated with my job as a First Officer, I noticed a very large strobe at my three O'clock position and at an altitude approximately 20 to 30 thousand feet above us tracking SSW.  No object outline was seen. Its apparent speed was slow, but in a South Direction. Object strobed approximately once every 7 seconds, as it moved in what appeared a straight line. I asked the Captain if he could see what I saw, but from his seating position in the aircraft, and the height of the sighting, he could not, and did not get out of his seat. We turned down the DUs...(Data display units) in the aircraft to rule out any reflections from inside the cockpit.  I called NY Center and asked them if they had any traffic or military traffic 20 to 30 thousand feet above and behind us and he indicated that he only had a Falcon Jet behind us going North...  Center asked other aircraft in our general area, if they could see any other traffic on their TCAS, or visually if they had any other reports. I think we were talking to NY Center, as our position was about 40NM south of KBGM (Binghampton, NY).  As the object passed above and behind us, I was indicating to the Captain where to look out his rear Clearview window to see the object.  He did not see it, as we were flying Westbound and the object was proceeding Southbound. We were out of range visually. All Aircraft reported nothing.  I think they asked Southwest and American, and possibly United. At the end of the sighting the time was 0020 Zulu or about 19:20 Eastern Time local.  I don't believe it was a satellite, as the sun was down, and satellites dont have strobes.  I have not run Nova Satellite prediction software, so I don't know if satellites were in the area.  http://www.nlsa.com/index.html Air Traffic Controller indicated that he was not surprised at the sighting as he receives them from time to time.  To Clarify:  In my report I refer to object.  I could see no object just a visible strobe.  No position lights.  I also thought when I first saw the strobe that it could be a distant star going supernovae.  Just a thought, as I was trying to figure out what it was.    END. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed to us to be an excellent witness.  PD));42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
high-altitude pulsed contrail;2006-04-29 13:40:00;20 seconds;high-altitude pulsed contrail Saw the thin, single-strand contrail (approximately four inches at arms length) of a rapidly-moving high-flying object in a cloudless, clear-blue afternoon sky. The contrail, formed by unevenly-spaced pulses, quickly dissipated. Could not see the eastbound aircraft itself with the naked eye. Estimate that it was flying higher than crosscountry jetliners, which appear to move slowly across the sky at cruising altitude. Initially saw the contrail of this object as it moved directly overhead. It disappeared in the distance with amazing speed. Viewing location was somewhat noisy so cannot report any sounds.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497

Vessel with huge bright lights stops and turns before Vanishing!;2012-08-18 21:00:00;1-2 minutes;Vessel with huge bright lights stops and turns before Vanishing! On Saturday evening, August 18, 2012 @ approximately 9pm, I was at a friend’s house for a barbeque.  Four of us were downstairs on the patio when we started to notice two huge lights from what we thought was an airplane. We commented on how big the headlights were when all of a sudden we saw this thing slow down and then it started to speed up and then it slowed down again to a STOP!   At one time we all said an airplane can’t do that. I also notice there was small red lights going up off this vessel that was visible in the sky.  I asked my friend if he had binoculars and to get them.  By this time this vessel made a right hand turn and started moving away and vanished. The lights were so big and bright you could not see the shape of it. We watched other airplanes that night fly over in certain fly patterns which this vessel seem to be in as well, before it made an about turn to the right and vanish.  All the airplanes we saw had the red light at the wing and we could see them flying for a long distance on this clear night.  This vessel was not following the same pattern the rest of the planes did and was not visible in a matter of a second.  This aircraft had no sound to it at all, it was just there. This craft also flew lower than the other planes that were in the same fly pattern.  What it was, I don’t know. On Wednesday morning I was talking to a girl from Italy on Facebook.  As we chatted, she tells me her Mother, Father and her also witness a UFO that same night at 9 pm. Could it be the same one?  I was fascinated and stunned at the same time. If it is the same aircraft or vessel, it had to travel awful fast to be here where we saw it.  She said her father works with airplanes all the time and he said that he knows that could be not a plane or helicopter for that matter.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
It was flying a distance away, it was blinking, and I couldn't make out a shape.;2014-09-08 22:03:00;80 seconds;It was flying a distance away, it was blinking, and I couldn't make out a shape. The object I saw was a good distance away. I'm not very good at telling distances but maybe around 20-25 miles away. When I first saw it, It seemed to be a plane but when I took a second glance it was very odd.  It was flying horizontally across the night sky. It flew straight like a plane. It Also seemed to have blinkers on, also second glance I notice that the blinkers were like three separate lights. First one would go off the back of the object, then the middle, and then the front and go back the end of the object and start al over.  Next Thing after it completed three blinks it seemed to skip forward a little bit and then start the blinking process all over again. Now I couldn't make out if it was a plane shape at all but it flew straight like one. I don't have an illustration because my camera wouldn't be able to pick anything at the distance up, and I couldn't make out a shape either. Hope this helps.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
Green light illuminating my window, but from no source.;2018-03-12 06:00:00;30 minutes +;Green light illuminating my window, but from no source. I am reporting this here as recommended by someone who heard my situation. Woke up around 6am to the dog jumping on my bed and running in a circle before running away, never barking as she would if there was something or someone outside.  I tried to go back to sleep but realized there was something lighting up my room.  Again, tried to ignore the light thinking it was a neighbor going to work or something, but 20 minutes later I am still trying to get to sleep and the light was so bright I could see it flashing even though my eyes were closed. I got out of bed and crept around the dark room looking outside for signs of someone messing with me, or a car, etc - nothing.  My only 2 neighbors at the top of this dead end hill were already gone for work.  I realized the light was only on one side of the room, in the window , illuminating it in the same way a lightning bug would, except it illuminated the whole 5 feet of window space/frame.  I looked all around inside the room, in the windowsill, and what I could see from the window, nothing but the uphill sight of trees with so much snow I can see anything that moves out there, but saw nothing and heard nothing. At this point I got scared, because I realized the only place it could be coming from that I couldn’t see, was directly underneath the window: a place I couldn’t see unless I went outside and I was too scared.  The next day, though, I checked and there were no footsteps or marks in the snow so that wasn’t where the light was coming from. I have blue solar lights out there, but this light was green like christmas light green. The light was on steady for 10 seconds, off for 5, and it lasted so long that after not being able to find the cause I got into bed with a knife and just sat listening for sounds, to get up and react to, nothing but the light, and I fell asleep counting the seconds of the light pulses, strangely seeing it with my eyes closed. I live on the edge of a large uninhabited area that borders a rock quarry. Also close to the borderline between Binghamton, NY, and Conklin, NY, where I see there was a reporting 50+ years ago.  A lot of military contract type of businesses (BAE, IBM, Lockheed, etc) so I haven’t thought twice about the military (looking) helicopter I see or hear 2-3 times a week but wouldn’t you know that the day after these lights scared me,  Helicopter (or multiple) kept going over this house repeatedly, at least 10 times between 9 am and noon, to the point that I stopped paying attention.   Just for the record, the only other strange thing here is once in awhile I hear a helicopter sound like it is right above but then there will be nothing there, absolutely no craft yet the sound as if it is close.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497

When we looked;2019-12-08 17:35:00;3 minutes;We were sitting in our college dorm and heard booming like a big truck was driving around in the distance but not quite.  When we looked at the sky it was flashing.  We texted our dorm group chat and others said they heard the noises but did not see the flashing lights like we did.  We did not see a specific craft, and the sky was mostly cloudless.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
