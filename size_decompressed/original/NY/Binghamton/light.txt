We saw what appeared to be five or six craft, moving fast and changing color.;2002-01-24 03:56:00;+/- 4  minutes;We saw what appeared to be five or six craft, moving fast and changing color. Myself and two friends were outside, in my backyard smoking cigarettes.  We were not intoxicated or under the influence of any form of inhibiting substance.  One of my friends was looking at the night sky, and told us to run over as quickly as possible.  She pointed upwards, and pointed out five, possibly six bright yellowish lights flying in a tight formation.  I thought they might be military craft, but as they flew, one of the lights turned a dark red, almost crimson color, and darted off at a ninety degree angle, flanking it's fellow craft and passing to the rear.  The other craft split up and circled in violent turns to rally on the first ships rear.  One of my friends reported hearing a sound, but that is unconfirmed, as neither my other friend or myself heard this sound.  Suddenly, they broke fast and vanished.  I know for a fact that no craft currently in use by any military force on this planet can manevuer like that.  After the event, we ran inside to get a camera, and waited outside for quite some time, but nothing happened after that. I have reported a somewhat similiar occurance in the same neighborhood quite some time ago, and I have heard rumors from this area that sightings have occured in the past five or six years.  Please DO NOT contact me via mail or telephone, but rather e-mail.  Other people I live with are extremely skeptical, as was I before the first of these occurances happened.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
STAR makes a u-turn;2003-08-14 21:00:00;15 seconds;STAR makes a u-turn I was looking towards the NW (towards Lake Ontario/Niagra falls area, but not that far away) sky and saw a large star move.  It had a orange-white glow to it. It was traveling towards the NW for 10 seconds and it covered about 15 % of the sky before it made a dead stop, did a looped U-turn and then just popped out of sight.  It was very high up, wasn't blnking like a plane, and was not a satellite. It was also not a meteorite  or anything else of that sort.  It was too slow for that, but too fast for a normal plane, and what kind of high altitude plane can stop on a dime and make a u-turn?  To note: this was the night of the blackout in the NE, and half of the electric was out in the area which gave us a decent chance to see clearly what was up in the sky.  There were also many criss-crossed chemtrails in the sky early the next morning.  I thought this was weird since the NE had very few airline flights from the previous 16-20 hours.

Multiple red lights over Binghamton,NY;2011-10-08 19:53:00;10 minutes;Multiple red lights over Binghamton, NY I was walking north Broad Ave and notice in the South East sky that 16-26 red lights rose slowly in the sky and as they rose the top one's disapeared and and more kept raising. They were bright red lights moving slowly making no noise and vanishing soon after reaching a point in the sky. I called 911 and made 2 reports and noone came to take my report,   i guess they took me as a hoax. but there was up to a dozen people watching this event. I did manage to take a few photo's and a short video with my iphone but it hard to determine the size or what the lights are.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
Light follows ISS.;2012-06-21 22:00:00;10 minutes;Light follows ISS. On the evening stated, I was watching a light go from south to northeast in the sky.  I thought it may have been the ISS, but according to the internet, it was not to be in the area for a bout 10 minutes.  About 10 minutes later, the ISS went by from North to NE like it was supposed to, but was trailed by another light behind, about the distance of putting a closed fist out at arms length.  It trailed it perfectly for 5 minutes until both went beyond the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Bright reddish lights over town, during rush hour.;2012-12-03 17:00:00;10 minutes;Bright reddish lights over town, during rush hour. After driving down a connecting road to Main street, Binghamton, my wife saw strange reddish glowing lights in formation, I too looked and saw them.  Many others saw them. People on the sidewalk as well as other drivers who stopped. Mind you this was 5p.m traffic.The object seemed to be in a triangle or diamond shape.  It appeared to be pulsing this reddish light, but very much not a strobe on a plane, or a helicopter. Then as we left a parking lot a very loud bang was heard.  It sounded like a gunshot but was very loud and could be heard a great distant away.  We know this because our neighbor also heard this at her home a half mile away.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
A light that sat in the sky then simply faded out. no plane. no planet, no satellite.;2013-09-28 20:00:00;10 minutes;A light that sat in the sky then simply faded out. no plane. no planet, no satellite.  My girlfriend was driving to pick up her son and called me from the road to go look at a strange light that didnt look like a planet or a plane. I took my camcorder outside and spotted a strange light, i assume it was the light she called me about,  At 1st it appeared to just be a normal plane coming in for a landing, but then i realized it was to far away to be that, after a while i realised it was not moving, so i continued video taping. The ligh simply sat in the sky right around the border of pennsylvania and NY.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
About 10 to 15 white lights in a line seen in Upstate New York.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-27 20:40:00;5 to 10 minutes;About 10 to 15 white lights in a line seen in Upstate New York I came home after a walk because the sun was starting to set.  Went out onto my back porch and looked up into the sky and saw 4 or 5 white lights that looked like stars moving forward in a straight line all at the same pace.  They were directly above my head and weren’t moving very fast although as they kept moving forward I saw more of them appear in my field of view. As they kept moving on I saw about 10 to 15 of them in total still in the formation of a straight line moving slowly forward away from where I can see them.  I did try to get this on video but my phone wouldn’t focus and on video it just looked like a blurry clip of the dark blue clouds.  I saw these lights go on for about 10 minutes I want to say.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
