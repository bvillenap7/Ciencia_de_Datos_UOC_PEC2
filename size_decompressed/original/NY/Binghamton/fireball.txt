Orange fireball;2003-10-25 02:30:00;1 minute;My wife (at the time) and I were driving back from Toronto.  We had attended a mediation course there.  We had passed Binghamton, New York (some 20 minutes earlier) and were heading to Sullivan County.  I was driving a silver Honda Accord.  As were drove around a bend (which was obscured by a hill) there was a bright orange fireball (approximately 15 feet in diameter) to the right of the highway on a flat grassed area at the bottom of a hill.  I did not observe a solid object above the fireball.  The fireball was about 20 feet off the ground and 300 feet from our vehicle. The ball of fire suddenly shot up vertically and headed up to the stars at an incredible speed.  I slowed down so we could watch it. I also turned around to see if the grass below it was alight.  There was no evidence of any burning or smouldering.  The fireball travelled at an incredible speed.  It was observable to the naked eye as it shot up towards the stars.  It made no sound at all. I did not report this at the time because I was worried that people my think I am not of right mind. I was practising as an attorney then.  My wife also did not report it because she held a senior teaching position and did not want any unnecessary attention.;42.1299049331963;-75.8952334018497
