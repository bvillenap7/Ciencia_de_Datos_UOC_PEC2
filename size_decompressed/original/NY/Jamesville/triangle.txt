Jamesville, NY, midnight UFO sighting.;2019-02-13 00:00:00;3 minutes;Jamesville, NY, midnight UFO sighting. As I was driving home from work...I drive home the same way every day...I was coming down the hill next to the Jamesville Prison, and I see this craft what thought was an airplane, but was going way too slow across the sky to be a plane.  It had lot of lights on it, white, red, green, blue.   As I got closer it was to the right side of the road, I immediately slowed down and pulled over, to try get pictures with my phone, the lights were so bright my phone wouldn't focus.  So I just watched it, it was triangular shape, quiet, and as I pulled over, it stopped going forward in direction and paused mid air, turned 180 degrees and started to slowly travel in the opposite direction I was.  Like it knew i was watching or saw it.  It also traveled in different speeds from slow to faster.  Then it disappeared behind the trees.;42.9801;-76.0727
