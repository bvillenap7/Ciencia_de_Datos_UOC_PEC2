We went through any possibilities of what the object could have been but all seemed to be wrong, of course the first one being that it was a plane.  We went over this but decided against it the object was simply too big to be a plane.   My grandmother suggested it was a rocket, but my friend and I quickly disregarded this theory.   We also suggested that it could be a star exploding but didn't have any evidence against or for this theory.  For all we know, it could have been a star exploding.
