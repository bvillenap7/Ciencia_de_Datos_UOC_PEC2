It was also bouncing around not going in a set direction. There was planes flying about, off in the distance so i thought, maybe a plane? but then it did something a plane does not do, it got real bright and went out as if someone blew a candle out. The other one i seen was in 1989, it was a florcient blue and cigar shaped. a friend of mine and i where near a park named dehoise park and there it was hovering over some trees that overlooked the lake. We both seen it and agreed it was a ufo and when we looked back at it, it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Report seems not inconsistent with airliner landing light at a distance.  They can disappear suddenly when the aircraft executes a turn.  PD));41.6542;-74.7024
