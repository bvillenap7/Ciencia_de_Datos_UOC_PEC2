The object was moving toward Pine Bush NY roughly. The object moved with very little sound, just a whisper of air movement but now large turbine or motor sound. It was dark but there were lights on all three sides of the object allowing to see that there was a center and it was solid not small planes flying in tight formation as the militatry sugests. The duration of the sighting was about one minute. Traffic was slightly heavy for that time of year and I did not have a camera or camcorder with me so pulling over was necessary. This object ot me was not a normal plane or like anything I have ever seen. I am not convinced it was full of little green men (but not oposed) but  it was not a plane or conventional aircraft by both visual or audio recognition.;41.6134;-74.5849
