Two lights following an aircraft;1999-12-16 20:00:00;2 min;Two lights following an aircraft Witnessed an aircraft flying south.  Noticed flasing red and white aircraft lights and heard sound.  Two white lights, not flasing but constant, where around the aircraft.  One to the rear right, off the right wingtip and one to the rear left of the aircraft.  Each light, measured best I could, was approximately from the tip of my middle finger to the base of my wrist.  They maintained their distance at a constant speed with the aircraft.;41.6134;-74.5849
