I do not recall which direction the light was moving. It was a cloudy night and the light appeared as if it were moving across the top of the clouds, reflecting to us observers below. It was almost reminiscent of a meteor or shooting star trailing across the sky, but because the light was repeating every few seconds, sometimes every 4 or 5 seconds, we did not suspect that this was a shooting star as it was generally in the same location and place.  We also considered a spotlight, but because of the location of the light (appearing above the clouds) we had skepticism of a spotlight or searchlight. At times, the light appeared blue and red as it trailed across the sky.  As this unfolded, we pulled over to witness the light for two minutes and could not determine the source or nature of the light. There were two of us on this night. The weather was overcast and cool (65°F-70°F).;40.8463;-72.803
