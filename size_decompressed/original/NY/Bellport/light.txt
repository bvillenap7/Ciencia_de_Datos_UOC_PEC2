9 Red Lights that appeared in the night sky......;2011-07-04 22:00:00;5 minutes;9 Red Lights that appeared in the night sky...... There were nine (9) circular red lights that appeared traveling three (3) in row in a eastward direction .  The first row of three were in straight line, side by side.  The second row were in almost forming a L shape and the third row were traveling in a triangle pattern.   As we watched and recorded the lights the first row of three appeared to be traveling further away before disappearing.  While the second row began to change formation  with two in the front and one trailing behind as if they were towing the third.  The last row of lights also changed formation and appeared to go around and pass the second row and go further out into the sky then disappear.   The second row continued at a steady but fast pace until they also went further into the night sky and disappeared.;40.7764;-72.9476
