Strange orange lights moving parallel in the sky.;2016-10-14 00:00:00;1 minute;Strange orange lights moving parallel in the sky. I was talking to my friend before she was leaving my house one night, and I remember, looking up at the night sky.  There were quite a number of stars out, as I live in the woods, so it was always nice to gaze up at them.  Then from the corner of my eye, I saw something orange. Looking over, I noticed lights in the sky, moving at the same speed and parallel with each other. Upon seeing them, it turned out there were two more sets of lights.  One of the sets of lights, reminded me of a colon symbol from the keyboard, moving straight over my house and over the trees.  Following the same path was another set of lights only the looked as if a colon was on it's side. The third set of lights, broke the formation by going diagonally across the sky.  It seemed to have started off with them but ended up breaking away, still staying parallel with itself.  It was almost as if the sets of lights were attached in the pairs by a bar. These lights didn't blink, and they weren't slow like a plane. They also seemed to be flying too low for them to be a plane as well. I'm pretty sure they were actually in the atmosphere. As I watched them, I had three thoughts cross my mind.  One was just surprise, but the other two thoughts stood out.  These thoughts were get inside and what are you looking for?.  Of course, I had stayed rooted to the spot until they were out of site, before my friend and I said goodbye. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
