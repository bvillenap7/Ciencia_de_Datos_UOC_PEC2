Then a fighter jet followed I was sitting on the beach with my friend, we saw a large craft of 7-8 fire balls shoot up out of the Long Island sound. It went up spinning. It went up a few hundred feet, then the fire balls turned off and turned into solid red lights (7-8 not spinning) the ufo then shot east at a high rate of speed, following was a f18 with full afterburner on. It wen directly after the craft. I took poor quality videos. (Three to be exact but short one second bursts because I was panicking);40.8549;-73.2157
