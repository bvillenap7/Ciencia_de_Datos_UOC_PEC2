Light Hovers in the NY sky... and it's not the first time...;2003-02-13 23:59:00;13 mins;Light Hovers in the NY sky... and it's not the first time... I was taking my dog for his last walk of the day in the park.  The night is so clear, and the moon lights up the whole snow covered scene.  While looking at the stars, I see a Bright Light hovering in the sky.  I don't think much about it, until I come back to it a moment later.  It is now in a different part of the sky... It's still hovering.  I decide to lighn it up with a steady object.  I pick a telephone pole, and stand so that the light is centered and just above the top of the pole from where I'm standing.  Now I can clearly see that the light is hovering, and moving, or rather swaing, from point to point. It is there as I left to go back inside.  I have seen this craft before, in New Hampshire, and in North Carolina.;40.8549;-73.2157
Large green light flying over Western Smithtown, Suffolk County Long Island;2012-01-08 20:50:00;1-2 seconds;Large green light flying over Western Smithtown, Suffolk County Long Island I was driving towards my home street with my girlfriend and while I was talking I saw a large bright green light in the night sky. The light was not exceptionally high in the sky but lower, and flew across the sky away from us. After about 1-2 seconds it completely vanished.  My reaction was What the f--- was that?! I asked my girlfriend if she saw it and she did and was freaked out.  I'm skeptical of UFOs and aliens but this was unlike any plane or shooting star I've ever seen and was a large green bright light.
