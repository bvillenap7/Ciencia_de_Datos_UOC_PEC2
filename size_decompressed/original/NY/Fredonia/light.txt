Bright orb like light shooting in multiple directions early morning.;2013-07-25 06:00:00;5 seconds;Bright orb like light shooting in multiple directions early morning. I pulled into my parking spot at work at around 6am. I noticed a light (orbish) which looked as bright as the North Star. It was at the awkward time in the morning where stars should be just out of sight so I found it strange and kept looking.  After a couple seconds the light bolted in a linear direction which appeared to be up, but due to the distance I couldn't be sure.  There was a slight trail to it because of the speed. It then made a sudden stop, paused and shot off in a diagonal (upper left) direction and appeared to vanish with a slight trail visible. I noticed this only because it seemed out of place and I've been trained (Marine Corp Vet) to notice small things out of the ordinary and have retained this training pretty well. It was pretty amazing to witness and didn't have time to pull out my phone to record it after it moved.;42.4325;-79.3328999999999
