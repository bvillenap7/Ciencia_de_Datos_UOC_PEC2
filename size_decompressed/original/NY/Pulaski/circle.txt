My 1st impressions were of helicopters on maneuvers from Fort Drum.   Coming on a straight course as if they had left the nuclear power plant at Oswego & were heading for our house.  (We are about 3 miles inland of the East Shore of Lake Ontario, Between Pulaski and Sandy Creek, NY)   They were in a straight line and we went out to see and hear better.  (I grabbed my camera too.)   There was never any sound.  Almost directly overhead they made a sharp right turn and headed South one at a time.   Just as they turned each in less than a minute became a dim white line and immediately disappeared.   This process took about 20-25 minutes total from sighting to disappearing.  Does anyone have any Idea what they were?  Pictures did not take in this box.. (all sitings perfect circles only one picture was circular)   As we watched they all looked like perfect spheres until turning.  I cannot explain those pictures that are not.  The pictures are in order of when taken.  Those you may think were the camera moving, show stars when in full size that are sharp & not even elongated.;43.5604;-76.1166000000001
