At around 9:30 PM July tenth 2011 in Canisteo N.Y., I observed a yellow red bright light for about one to two minutes before the light faded.  At the time I was on the corner of Russell St, and W Academy St, (near the high school).   While on that corner I looked north west toward the city of Hornell.  That’s when I observed one silently moving yellow red light just above the tree line for about one minute before ascending slowly then fading slowly as well.    I observed, aside from its color, and movement, that it is about ¼ of an inch in diameter from my perception far larger than any satellite I have seen.   Also that it seemed to lack the look of any airplane or helicopter as it lacked the standard blinking aeronautical lights of such aircraft.   The nighttime weather at the time was pleasant, in the low seventies with little haze, or fog.  I have seen bright orange lights just after sunset from aircraft, probably from the sun reflecting of the fuselage.   The object however was seen long after sunset as the sky was dark blue to the west, and the object was west not east of my position, ruling out any solar reflection.   It may have been some kind of spotlight from a plane or helicopter, but as mentioned I saw nothing in the way of aeronautical lighting.;42.2659;-77.5857
Bright white light;2020-09-06 21:34:00;5 seconds;Bright white light I was driving through the countryside, when I seen a shooting star.  I thought it look weird coming in fast at a weird angle (upside down sharp-curved like).  Then it disappeared. Then 1 minute later, I saw a flickering light hovering above a heavily wooded area.  The light shine so brightly, almost like an LED light except you could see the beam of light shining below.  The big white light shine through the tree tops.  It was suspended low in the tree line.  The light flickering white, yellow, then bright white again.  The beam only shone through the trees when it flicker to bright white.  This lasted only a few seconds before completely vanishing.;42.2659;-77.5857
