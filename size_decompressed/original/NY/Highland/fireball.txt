PD));2007-10-31 02:45:00;3-5 seconds;I witnessed a lowflying thick bright green fire trail that appeared out of nowehere. I was pulling into my girlfriend's driveway around 2:30-2:45 am. She was asleep in the car. As soon as I drove up to the house I looked to the back side of the house because this huge bright green fire trail appeared out of nowhere.  I have seen this type of U.F.O. before with my girlfriend, but never has it been this low and describable. When I had seen it before, about a year ago but in the same town, it was very high up in the night sky. The trail was too far away to see as flames. I realize that it actually traveled the exact same direction.  There is absolutely no way that this was some meteorite falling out of the sky. It's path and trail was so defined and visually unique. Holding my thumb and pointer finger to my eye, it was an inch thick, and the trail was a good 4-5 inches long. It looked like flames reaching outward for oxygen. It didn't trickle off into other colors. It's integrity remained the same the entire time it was in my line of site.  It almost seemed to take off from the vast wooded area. Not a vertical lift at all, but coming from a slight angle and never curving away. It stayed straight in it's path with it's long bright green fire trail escaping further view over the distant trees.  I have to note that I am near a military airport, Stewart International. I was unable to see the source which created the trail. It was too dark to see anything other than the green fire trail. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));41.7171;-73.9925999999999
