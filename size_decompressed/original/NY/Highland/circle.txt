Every once in a while they would burst into colors, both the same time. about 1 hour later we notice alot planes flying around. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witnesses may have been looking at twinkling stars.   The witness was kind enough to forward approximately 12-14 minutes of video tape, which we have reviewed.  Based on the footage, we believe the objects were celestial bodies.  PD));41.7171;-73.9925999999999
