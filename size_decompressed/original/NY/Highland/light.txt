I was looking at the stars and saw a bunch of lights in a V formation traveling north(looked like glowing geese) I pointed to the sky and my fiance saw it as well. We watched it for a few seconds and right before it disappeared it made a zig zag pattern crossing over top of eachother. We watched for a little bit longer and could not see it again.;41.7171;-73.9925999999999
