quick long flashing hovering object;2010-10-23 07:00:00;10 seconds;quick long flashing hovering object Me and my friend were in our car driving into our development at night when there was a fullmoon and something caught both of our eyes hovering above us through the sky.  We slowed down to watch it. It was long and had blue flashy lights.  There was no wings and it didnt look like it was flying it was more hovering. It moved quickly though, it was only there for about 10 seconds and then it was gone.  It was probably about 500 ft up.;41.7171;-73.9925999999999
