Two objects come in contact in the sky nose to nose and one revolves around the other.;2008-06-30 03:00:00;5 minutes;Two objects come in contact in the sky nose to nose and one revolves around the other. I was outside at 3:00am looking up into the sky, and spotted and object that looked like a star gliding across the sky.   As I'm looking at the object, another one comes into view coming from the opposite direction.  I then focused on the 2nd object because it was brighter and a solid yellow color.   As i`m watching it glide by, I noticed the first object heading directly towards the other.  I then thought, I`m about to witness an accident, but the two objects came in contact with eachother and stopped.   Immediatly afterwards, the yellow object made a complete 360 degree turn around the other object with the point (triangle shaped) facing the object #1 the entire time.   After it completed the circle, object #2 began to glide away until out of sight behind the trees.  Object #1 glided for a moment, shot upwards into the sky, and then stood still like a star.   As I walked into my house to grab a camera to get a photo of object #1, it then disappeared completely.  I belive that there is no man-made objects or cosmic phenomenon that could do what these objects did. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
