My wife thought it was shaped like an angel. The light was for about 10 seconds or so and then it was gone, like it was on a switch and turned off and we thought we saw the cloud after the light disappeared, but the sky was very dark and the milky way was so clear that it was hard to tell. The weather and radar for the night had no clouds in the area. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));40.9928;-72.0961
