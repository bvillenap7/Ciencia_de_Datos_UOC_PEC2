((HOAX??))  sighted grey object, it then exploded in light and disappeared;2008-07-16 11:00:00;seconds;sighted grey object, it then exploded in light and disappeared I was biking to the beach right before noon and just as I was going to turn in the lot, I saw this greyish object flying far and to the right in the sky. I kept on looking at it, it wasn't moving, and then all of a sudden the whole thing exploded in light and then it disappeared. I scanned the sky for it, but it was gone.
