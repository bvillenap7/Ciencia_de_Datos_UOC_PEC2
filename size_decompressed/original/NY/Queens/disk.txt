Green orb released from a flat saucer like craft hovering inexplicably;2019-07-22 00:00:00;54 seconds;Green orb released from a flat saucer like craft hovering inexplicably Date: Monday July 22, 2019 Time: 3:35 pm  Location:  Intersection of 112th Street and Northern Blvd.,  Corona (Queens) NY  I was driving westbound on Northern Blvd. I was stopped at a red light.  I looked up and noticed light rays shining down from a light source behind a dark cloud.   Below that I noticed a large faint flat “saucer” like object.  From that object, a bright green orb was released.  This orb can be seen very clearly in the video.  A bird seemed to have approached the orb at one point before quickly veering away from it. I pulled over briefly and continued to film after the light turned green.  The orb lingered in my field of vision for a while.  It almost seemed as if it knew I was filming, following my camera as it moved.  I stopped filming because I eventually became frightened by the fact that the orb continued to linger in front of me inexplicably.  I wanted to leave the area as soon possible and drove away.;40.7303985449532;-73.8568301118075
