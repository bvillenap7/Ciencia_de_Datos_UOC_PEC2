Small, shiny object changing colors oddly moving in NYC sky;2021-01-23 16:45:00;40 seconds;Small, shiny object changing colors oddly moving in NYC sky I am an executive who resides in NYC and have a clear view of the sky from my apartment.  As I was looking out of my apartment window at a clear blue sky taking on the phone to a friend I noticed a small shiny object that seemed to be floating in the sky.  At first I assumed it was a shiny balloon since it was moving in a flowing fashion but then I noticed it take a quick move in a perfectly straight line heading straight up in the sky.  its colors are very difficult to describe and were shiny and varied. I can't say I was looking at one distinct color.  I was relaying what I saw to my friend on the phone remarking how strange it was.  I live near 2 airports in NYC and am very used to planes and see police helicopter often.  We changed subject and after 20 minutes the object returned to another point in the sky.  I ran to the window to get a better look and it did the same as it had done before - moved smoothly in all sorts of directions then went absolutely! pin straight up in the sky.  At that point it disappeared very high above Willow Lake in Queens.  I don't know what this object was but it was fascinating to look at.  I haven't seen anything like it before.  Very strange.;40.7303985449532;-73.8568301118075
