July 4 , 2013 Every year, for the past 20 years ,  we went  on a family vacation to Long Lake located in the central Adirondacks in New York State.   We were waiting for the annual Fourth of July fireworks display to begin  when at 9:30 pm we saw something we will never forget.  We were sitting in a van located just south  of the bridge on Long Lake, in an elevated piece of property with great views of the lake that runs southwest to northeast.  We stayed in the van because of the mosquitoes.  At 9:30 pm we saw a slow moving glowing , circular object (orange , yellow)  in  the sky,  about 5 times the size of the North Star, it was then followed by another, and another.  I got out of the van to listen and yet they were silent.  After about the third glowing object, others came in clusters, and then singles again.  There were about 25 in all.  It looked like an invasion.  There was one that looked brighter and bigger  then the others and stood motionless while the others passed.  It disappeared! while they were passing it and  reappeared when all had passed.  They all moved slowly and made no sharp turns from a westerly southwesterly direction to an easterly northeasterly direction.  This amazing sight  lasted no more than 10 minutes, but we will remember it for a lifetime.;43.9456;-74.4614
