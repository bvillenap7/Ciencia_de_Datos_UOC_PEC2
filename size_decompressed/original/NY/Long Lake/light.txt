light in the sky;2008-06-26 00:00:00;seconds;light in the sky My family and I go camping in upstate New York every summer, and have been for years. In the mountains we are used to seeing alot more due to the elevation, including satellites, shooting stars, constellations, even planets, much more than we see in Massachusetts. What my older brother and I saw that night was nothing like that. The rest of family went to sleep, it was just the two of us, sitting on a large rock looking at the stars. Out of nowhere, in the middle of the sky, a round white light appeared, it seemed to be as far away as the stars. Then as fast as it had appeared, defying all laws of motion, aircraft, it looped extremely fast and dissapeered in a trail. Very far from the city, nothing but trees, mountains in the distance, and a glassy lake reflecting it all, everything we see is plain as day.  the best i can describe, is it appeared in a white flash, then blasted into a U shaped motion, leaving a white haze trail litterally as if it went into hyperspace. and it was gone. As i turned to my brother to say did you see that? he spoke the same words, and we instantly knew we saw somthing extraordinary. However, my brother's account of the event, and mine, are different. I saw a flash of light that moved in amazing rate and direction, he said he saw a massive object, appear, then dissapeer. Maybe it was his angle, i did not see a large actual object, but for me to see this light if it was as far away as i think it was, must have been very large. This was not a flare, or a plane, or anything i've ever seen in the sky before. i don't know of anything that can change it's course without being acted on by an outside force. Not looking for an investigation, we just want to help with the search for the truth behind all of these sightings, so I wanted to report this thinking maybe there were more sightings like ours in upstate NY.
