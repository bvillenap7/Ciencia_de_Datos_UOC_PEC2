giant ufo over southern adirondacks;1997-12-10 20:00:00;3 minutes;giant ufo over southern adirondacks My dad and I were driving west on rte 149 and saw a giant flying object.  We stopped our vehicle and got out to investigate.  The object was completely silent and had numerous illiuminated windows.  The best way I can describe it is that is looked like a giant flying cruise ship with all of its lights on.  It was completely dark that night and the shape of the object other than the lights was difficult to distinguish.  It was difficult to get a distance on the object as it was so big.  If it was close to us (within say half a mile) I would estimate it was 300 to 400 yards or more in length and maybe 80 to 120 yards or more high.  If it was further away, it was bigger than that.   The object was flying in a northerly direction at a fairly slow speed and not at high elevation.  It flew out of sight heading over the mountains. I am guessing at the date of this sighting as I think I was 32 years old at the time.  It occured in the late fall or winter period around 1997 give or take a year.
