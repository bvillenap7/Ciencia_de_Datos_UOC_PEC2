Fast round flying object seen over golf course in NYC;2007-07-07 10:21:00;5 min.;Fast round flying object seen over golf course in NYC First i would like to say that im a sceptic.TRUELY!  But, i swear on all thing holy,and if i am lying may i be killed before my family.I SAW A UNIDENTIFIED,FLYING,OBJECT.Im not saying it was an Alien,but this was astonishing and terrorfying at the same time.I was telling my friend that i saw a craft flying at a high alltitude that could change shape and direction and slow down at a dime.And as soon as i said that, WE saw it. while we sat in the golf cartoh yeah this all happened on a golf course,Which i guess im not supossed to disclose!4 whatever reason,i saw the same thing again.As we sat stationary,we followed it with our eyes,and all of a suddend a bright orange meteor intersected the path of the object.then it continued to move in an a fast,low,fast,slow pace. Then the U.F.O disappeard. Then get this,not 1 but 3 three meteor flew across the sky in the same direction as the craft.NOW, can somebody explain what the fuck i saw?I will swear before a grand jury that all of the above is True.;40.9484;-73.7324
