UFO sighting in June 2014.;2014-06-27 01:00:00;~5 minutes;UFO sighting in June 2014 As I went to take out my dog in my backyard, I noticed an object floating in the sky, stationary in a location known to have no lights or anything like that should be in the area.  It was about 300 to 500 meters away from my location.   I took two pictures one at 00:58 and 01:00 hours.  Around 01:30 the object was not in the area.   At first, I thought the objects were construction lights by the train tracks but the UFO wasn't even close to the tracks.  There are many white lights on the UFO with a hint of blue on top of the oval shape.;40.9484;-73.7324
