Bright light flying over my house on Christmas Day.;2014-12-25 22:00:00;15 seconds;Bright light flying over my house on Christmas Day. Me and my brother and my sister came back from looking at Christmas light decorations on the houses in the neighborhood and then walking home to our house we saw this very bright light fly right over my house about 10 to 20 stories high.  Just me and my brother saw this sighting so clear and unbelievable we were pretty shocked.   This was just last Christmas and it was a beautiful sighting on Christmas Day.   I have seen many streaking lights in the night sky the last couple years in this neighborhood.;40.9715;-73.722
