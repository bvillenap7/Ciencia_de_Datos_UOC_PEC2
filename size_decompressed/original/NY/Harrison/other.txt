This object projected a clear shadow (exactly what it looked like) against the trees. Approximately, two minutes before it rose, I felt a sharp blow to my face as though someone threw an acorn or something slighly heavy directly to my face. I could not see what struck me.  The web was high enough off the ground as the projected image against the trees was high up.;40.9715;-73.722
