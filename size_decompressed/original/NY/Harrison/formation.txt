Vehicle sighting of 5 unknown lights above the highway.;2012-03-29 22:40:00;18 minutes;Vehicle sighting of 5 unknown lights above the highway. I was driving with my wife North on I 684. On approaching the Westchester County Airport in, Harrison, NY, I noticed flashing lights, ahead of me, above the clouds in the Northwest sky.  I assumed they were lights from the airport.  Upon passing the airport I continued to see the lights ahead of me. There was no determinable shape, or object but they looked more like wisps of smoke.  As the trip continued, we saw 5 lights, ahead if us, in what appeared to be in formation, with one brighter light in the center surrounded by 4 other lights.  My best description of this was it looked like a flying aces air show. The 4 lights would emerge with the center light and then break off again in formation.  At one point 2 of the lights were on my driver side and 2 I could see in the rear view mirror.  I thought we were finally passing them when they traveled again in front of us.  After approximately 20 miles we lost sight of them.  I am a retired police officer and my wife a r! etired nurse both skeptical of UFO's but this experience changed our view on such phenomena.;40.9715;-73.722
