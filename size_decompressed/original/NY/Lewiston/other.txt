It was white, shaped like a jet but it had 2 small wings in the front on each side slanted backwards and 2 larger wings on each side in the back slanted backwards. It was rather high up, rather large with no sound heard( we were drifting)and no vapor trail- boat engine was off.Two guys fishing over from us noticed it 1st, whistled and pointed up.I am aware there is an Airforce Base in the Falls. Could it be an existing or secret new fighter or does it match any other sightings?.I am 34, an investment banker. The boat owner is 35, an engineer.We fish the Gorge many times every year - the salmon are running now. There were at least 15/20 more boats with 2/3 per boat in the same area we were at the time. Could you let me know what you think it was?Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  Description of object is not inconsistent with appearance of a VariEze or VariViggen aircraft, designed by Burt Rutan.  Although they generally are loud when they fly nearby, if at a distance, they might not be audibly noticable.));43.1743;-79.0215
