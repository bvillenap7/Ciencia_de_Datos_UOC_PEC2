Since its only the beginning of Spring the trees haven't filled with leaves yet so I had a great view of the sky from my small backyard which is normally covered by a massive tree's leaves.  I looked up and to the south I saw what I thought were 2 of those shiny, metallic looking balloons that have helium in them.  They were very shiny and looked spherical in shape.  The objects seemed to be moving slowly and then they started doing a sort of dance, flying around within 30 ft of each other.  Then I noticed a peculiar detail about the way they were moving.  We just got through a really bad storm on Long Island and it was our first day of Sun, a really beautiful day with few clouds if any but it was windy.  The direction of the wind would have been blowing these things away but they stayed in the same general area for about 30 seconds, staying close to each other.  I turned and went to get my camera b! ut before I opened the door to go inside I took a last glance to get a reference of where they were but they started moving a bit more actively and I returned looking at them.  They started moving apart and I saw one start moving upward and forward and it just took off in an instant, there was no vapor trail or anything,  I couldn't even see what the other one did as I was fixated on the one that zoomed off.  The whole event was no more than 45 seconds to a minute long.;40.6384;-73.6913
