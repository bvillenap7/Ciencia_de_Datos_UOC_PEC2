LILCO Lot Sighting;1987-09-01 20:00:00;less than 1 minute;LILCO Lot Sighting In 1987 I observed what at first I thought was an airplane hovering above a LILCO (now LIPA) sub-station from a window on the second floor of my home.  Because it was “hovering”  I realized iy must not be a plane and continued to look at it closer.  I then noticed its 5 or 6 lights were flashing in sequence on a somewhat flat semi-circular object.   Within seconds it zipped off towards the South at a speed that no normal aircraft could travel.  I was 12 years old.   I remember telling my family, who laughed it off.  I never mentioned it again and had completely forgotten about it until about a year ago.  Not sure what triggered the memory or whay I never recalled it until recently.
