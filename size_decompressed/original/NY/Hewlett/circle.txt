2 sets of 6 large rotating white lights in Hewlett, N.Y.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights?  PD));2019-12-20 20:00:00;5 hours;2 sets of 6 large rotating white lights in Hewlett, N.Y. i was putting the trash out at about 8 pm on 12/20/19. I often look up in the sky but tonight was different. I looked up into the sky, which was cloudy. Directly overhead, I could easily see 6 large circular lights rotating clockwise. The light was white, but not very bright and shining down into the bottom of the cloud like it was coming from inside of the cloud. Just east of these, there were another 6 lights rotating counter clockwise. They were of the same white color and also not bright. There was no noise that I could hear. I went inside to call my wife and she also saw them. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. These lights were up there rotating until we went to bed at 1 am, so they were there more than 5 hours.;40.6384;-73.6913
