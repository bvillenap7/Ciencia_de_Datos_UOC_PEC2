large black sphere with smaller white light sphere orbiting larger one about 50 feet from the ground.;2017-02-23 19:50:00;4 seconds;large black sphere with smaller white light sphere orbiting larger one about 50 feet from the ground. I was driving with my roommate, when I noticed about 50 feet up in the air a pitch black sphere.  It was about 40 feet in diameter and dark like a black hole.  It had another smaller very bright white light sphere orbiting it like an electron orbiting a atom.  It was changing its orbit every time it came around.  It was very close to us and moving very slowly closer.  We watched as the small light orbited 3 times every time the light would go around the opposite side of the black sphere there was no light present refracting onto houses or anything around it was as if the black orb swallowed it.  It was as if for a second it completely disappeared and then reappeared on the opposite side of the larger dark sphere.  It lasted for about 4-5 seconds before completely disappearing.;41.8393;-74.0783
