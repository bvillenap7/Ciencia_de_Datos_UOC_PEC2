Bright orange glow with short fixed wings sighted;2013-05-20 22:30:00;3 minutes;Bright orange glow with short fixed wings sighted I spotted a single fireball (bright orange glow) with short fixed wings traveling slowly around helicopter height in the night sky.  The glow first traveled in a northerly, then northeast and finally an easterly direction.   From where the object appeared in the sky it seemed to track to the north shore of Long Island then make its turn east, probably following the north shoreline of Long Island.  I eventually lost sight of the object.  It either burned out or traveled far enough away not to be seen with the naked eye.;40.8344;-73.7008
