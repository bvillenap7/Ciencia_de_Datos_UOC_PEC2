It was sort of a football shape - it seemed to be glowing a kind of whitish yellow.  It had blinking white lights on the top and one on each side.  The bottom had a blinking red light.  It looked to have a row of black shapes (or windows) circling toward the top just under what appeared to be a dome.  The object seemed to be changing shape as it moved back and forth.  The witnesses were me,  my mother, and an older husband and wife whose names I neglected to write down. They were curious and intrigued with what I was video taping (and proceeded to tell me of their own UFO sighting.)  An official looking woman came over - asked me what I was doing in a authoritative manner and then told me I wasn't allowed to video tape on the dock. I kept filming.  Incidently, we were attending a summer band concert at Sunset Park in Port Washington, Long Island.  I want to mention when I first saw the object it was nothing but a faint glow in the distance.  At first I thought it was the moon shining through the clouds but when I zoomed in with my camera, I knew it was something else because it had blinking lights.;40.8344;-73.7008
