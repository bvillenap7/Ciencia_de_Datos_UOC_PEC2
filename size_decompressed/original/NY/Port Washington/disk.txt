My husband and I were sitting in our car beside the Manhasset Bay when I decided to take a picture of our town across the water. Just after the picture was taken in my iPhone we both recalled seeing a flash of light in the sky. Realizing that my camera may have been in “live” mode, we played it back and couldn’t believe we had gotten the incident on video. (My camera flash was NOT on when I had taken the picture). What the video revealed was 2 separate aircrafts that seemed to be traveling in synch, but not on the same level. The larger one on the right traveled extremely quickly across the sky before disappearing completely, while the seemingly smaller craft follows along but can still be seen in the video after the first craft disappears. There is a distinct “clicking” noise that can be heard just as the first craft vanishes into thin air.;40.8344;-73.7008
