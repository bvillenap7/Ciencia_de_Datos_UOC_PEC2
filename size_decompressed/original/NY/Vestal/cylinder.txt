No sound or vapor trail, no wings or tail structure. My wife and I were gardening in early evening about 12 minutes before sunset.  The sky was clear with very few clouds.  We watched as a cylindrical craft traveled from the SW to NE at a uniform rate of speed, passing overhead just to the south of us.  It had a row of very bright white lights along the side of the body, the body had a very reflective metallic appearance. The craft appeared to be at least 25 diameters in length, a very long cylindrical structure.   It was sufficiently low in altitude so that we could see that it was not a conventional aircraft, no wings, tail or other visible structures.  It progressed uniformly along a straight line path at a bearing of about 20 degrees north of East.  No vapor trail or no emission of sounds.  We frequently watch the many high altitude commercial flights that cross over this area.  This craft did not follow any of the paths usually followed by the airliners.  This craft was much lower and any engine noise should have been noticeable.;42.0754999999997;-76.0089000000006

As it turned, the sun's rays reflected from a row of at least 20 windows along the side. My wife and I were stopped at a gas station near the Vestal library when we spotted this long cylindrical object silently flying in the southern sky.  It had no features such as wings or tail structures and had a shiny metallic appearance.   It was traveling much slower than the similar object that we observed on May 30, 1999.  It was traveling to the east when we first noticed it, but it then started to make a slow right hand turn.  As it turned, it passed through the angle at which it reflected the suns rays towards us.  For a short time a row of at least 20 individual bright lights appeared on the side.  These lights may have been the reflection of the sun from a row of windows on the side of the craft.  As it turned southward along route 26, it climbed in altitude and then suddenly disappeared at an extreme rate of speed.  No sound or vapor trail was apparent.  The sky was perfectly clear.  This sighting occurred at almost the same time as the previous one, right before sunset.;42.0754999999997;-76.0089000000006
