At 04:00, in the clear night sky a diamond pattern of lights, varying from blue to green to red to white, hovering. ((anonymous rept.));2016-10-11 04:00:00;44 minutes;At 4:00 a.m. in the clear night sky a diamond pattern of lights, varying from blue to green to red to white, were observed hovering. Hovering lights very high in the clear night sky.  Observed for 44 minutes, from 4:00 a.m. until 4:44 a.m.  Lights varying from blues to greens to reds, some white lights, circular at times, often in a diamond shape or pattern, once in a great while a white light shoots from it off to the west of the hovering.  Observed to the southern sky of the New York/Pennsylvania border.  It appears there are one or two also hovering smaller lights to the west of the hovering light pattern, also high in the night sky.  It is all too close to be a satellite, and isnâ€™t moving as the space station would or a plane or helicopter could or would.  Two airplanes ascended at 4:30 a.m., but far too low and close to the earth by comparison to the hovering lights.  The smaller hovering lights to the west of the diamond pattern lights are greenish and white.  The smaller hovering lights are more concealed.  How can those lights hover for so long?  Fascinating to observe.;42.0754999999997;-76.0089000000006
