Formation of light colored orb-like crafts dance around one another, then vanish.;2009-03-22 20:51:00;15 seconds;Formation of light colored orb-like crafts dance around one another, then vanish. i walked out of my apartment complex in a shopping plaza well-lit by fluorescent lamps. i was not looking at the sky deliberately, and my gaze was attracted toward the sky at approximately 45 degrees upward and north from my position.  i saw lights moving around in the sky. they were strange in appearance - a look i can only describe as cool: i saw a group of white/cream luminescent orbs dancing around one another.  i stopped, confused. i wondered if these could be birds or something rising up from the surface. there was a formation of six or seven crafts which seemed to be interweaving. they all appeared to be moving away from me but yet some seemed to be moving backwards and sideways within this overall forward motion.  i could not tell how far away or how fast they were. within a moment, the lights became slightly dimmer and then totally vanished.;42.0754999999997;-76.0089000000006
