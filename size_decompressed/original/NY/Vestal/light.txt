Light flies over observatory immediatly after MIR.;1999-07-26 21:30:00;1 minute;Light flies over observatory immediatly after MIR. We were outside looking at MIR flying over, but right after MIR flew by, we saw a bright light fly fastly over the trees. We tried to explain the object: it couldn't be a heliocopter because we did not hear a heliocopter and it couldn't be a jet or a propeller plane because it was flying too low. Also, the object turned very sharply southeast after a minute and disappeared.;42.0754999999997;-76.0089000000006
A large, green ball of light streaked across the sky, and looked if it were going to crash into the ground;2001-04-02 00:05:00;10 seconds;A large, green ball of light streaked across the sky, and looked if it were going to crash into the ground I was waiting for the bus home from work @ approximately 24:05. I was chatting with one of my co-workers, and I happened to glance to my left. A large, bright green ball of light with a green tail streaked across the sky at a very fast pace, moving downwards at a steep angle. It looked to me as though the ball would crash into the college campus located about 1/4 of a mile east up the road. I asked my co-worker if she had also seen the light, and she said that she had, but only for a few seconds. I kept waiting for the resounding crash that I was sure was coming when the craft would hit the earth, but I heard nothing. Initially, I thought it may have been a plane that was in some sort of trouble, but then, after I got on the bus, and my co-worker and I talked more about it, I realized that it might not have been just a plane. It made no noise whatsoever, and from where we were standing, it was not that far away that we wouldn't have heard the roar of the engine if it were a plane. I have just read another person's account of a similar ball of green light shooting towards the ground 2 years ago in Johnson City, NY, about 7 miles away from where I had my sighting, and that is what has really convinced me to share my experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrected date of sighting.  We have amended the date here.  PD)) Message:  Dear Sir or Madam, I sent a report to your office via email on 5/21/01 about a green fireball that I saw streak through the sky in Vestal, NY, USA. On the report form, I accidentally filled out the event date incorrectly as 4/02/2000, when the event actually happened around 4/02/2001. I just wanted to clear up my mistake. Thank you.;42.0754999999997;-76.0089000000006
Three lights forming tight triangle hovered in the sky for about 15 mins then was gone.;2014-04-17 23:30:00;15 minutes;Three lights forming tight triangle hovered in the sky for about 15 mins then was gone. At first glance looked like a bright star but then my husband and I saw it move slightly to the right.   After watching for a few minutes I saw it wasn't a bright light but three lights forming a tight triangular shape.  It hovered but moved slightly the whole time we watched.   Our neighbors came out and watched with us a few more minutes and this same hover and sway thing repeated.   It reminded me of a boat that's anchored it had a slight bobbling movement.  Make sense?  We went inside after watching for about 15 minutes.  We came outside about 20 minutes later and it was completely gone. Also want to point out that while we were observing many airplanes were suddenly out.  As many as five at once in the same general area and direction in the sky.  Hmmmâ€¦;42.0754999999997;-76.0089000000006
