A very large slow moving triangle with bright strobes and no sound;2003-10-21 19:00:00;20-30seconds;A very large slow moving triangle with bright strobes and no sound As my wife and I were headed back to our car after having been shopping I looked up and noticed very bright and fast flashing strobes. At first I thought they were planes heading to the Albany airport but then realized they were part of a very large and slowing moving triangle shaped object. It head from East to West then banked very slowly to the southwest and dropped behind the hills and out of sight. I estimate it about 600 feet or so above the ground. During our sighting another person asked what we were looking at and when I pointed up they panicked and left very quickly. There was quite a distance between the strobes, more so than any aircraft I've ever seen. Could not make out any structure between the lights but could tell they were all afixed to the same object as they all moved with each other in one fluid motion.It also had no sound at all. The sky was partly cloudy with stars visible . It was quite interesting but creepy.;42.8111;-73.6946
