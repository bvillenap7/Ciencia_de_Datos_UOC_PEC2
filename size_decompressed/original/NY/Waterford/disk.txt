Yellow/orange orb pulsating near Hudson River in Waterford, NY.;2017-08-25 21:30:00;2 minutes;Yellow/ orange orb pulsating near Hudson River in Waterford, NY. East of Route 32, we saw a pulsating orange/yellow light in the night sky traveling westbound.   As we pulled the car off the road and exited onto the gravel, the craft moved and then stopped, continuing to pulsate, then it moved slowly eastward, disappearing behind a tree.   When I walked over to where I could see around the tree, it had totally disappeared.;42.8111;-73.6946
