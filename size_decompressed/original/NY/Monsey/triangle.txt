I'll never forget it. It was the most amazing thing that I had ever witnessed. We thought we were looking at a satellite, until we were informed that satellites are constant... do not spin nor jut. The object was triagular. It must have been huge, because we could see it vividly within the stars. It had lights all around it that only shined around it when it was stopped. When the U.F.O. moved, the arrow heard would point into the direction it was travelling to-then jut to that position. Stop -spin-lights also spinning- point into another direction ..then jut to that position. It did this until it was out of our focus range.;41.1171;-74.0685
