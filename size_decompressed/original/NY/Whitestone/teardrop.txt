I was walking my dog at that time when she started barking insanely.  then she ran away from me as if she was scared.  This was pretty suprising because my dog is a part Doberman and part pit bull. i didn't think anything would scare her.  About 10 seconds after she left, a saw strange lights that started to get bigger and bigger. And then, i saw a really nice, sleek, blue-silvery ship.  At first i thought it was a plane, but it turned out that it wasn't.  I came to that conclusion because no ship on earth,  I think, can be able to vanish into thin air, which it did about 2 minutes after i spotted the ship.;40.7852;-73.8098
