We were sitting around a campfire when one guy yelled, “What is that?!!”  Above us, in the clearing between trees, we saw a round, bright object flying above us at low plane level.  It looked as bright as and as large as a small full moon.  It looked illuminated. It seemed like there was a plane just before it and another just after it, but flying below it.  It was not a high-speed chase, more like a casual rate of speed.  We lost sight of it when it went past the trees.;43.2657;-74.2308
