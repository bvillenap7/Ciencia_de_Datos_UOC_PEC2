Glowing orange orb in the sky... Strange.;2013-09-19 20:05:00;10 minutes;Glowing orange orb in the sky... Strange We saw a bright, glowing orange orb-like object in the sky.  There were planes in the sky, too...  Very different. Clear night, stars visible.  The object moved slowly in a straight line, stopped and stayed in place for periods of time (30-60 seconds at a time). It was far away, but closer than a plane.  When a plane came lose to the object, it seemed to disappear... Went away.  The object reappeared about 5 minutes later way over to the right if where it had disappeared.  Absolutely no sound.  Moved back and forth, slowly.  Stopped and was still for about 60 seconds before ascending at an angle up to the left then disappearing again. I lined the first sighting with my phone.  When it came back, I attempted to film again but my phone froze, completely, with a strange picture of a whitish object in the blackness.  I was unable to film the second sighting and had to restart my phone...  The picture tht had been frozen on the screen was nowhere to be found.  Very strange.   I'm interested to see if any other sightings were reported that nightâ€¦;43.2657;-74.2308
