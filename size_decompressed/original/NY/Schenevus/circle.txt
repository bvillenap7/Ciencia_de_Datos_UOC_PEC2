Red, blue and white lights continuously moving on unidentified object in Upstate NY sky;2005-09-04 22:30:00;1 hour;Red, blue and white lights continuously moving on unidentified object in Upstate NY sky We were stargazing with binoculars at approx 10:30 p.m. Upstate NY. The Farmhouse we stay at is on top of a mountain and the sky was completely clear. Gazing to the North East sky, we noticed a very bright twinkling star above the treetops. At first we thought it was a satellite, weather balloon or military plane, however, after looking at it through wthe binoculars we all saw the alternating red, blue-green and white lights moving continuously around the unidentified object. While watching the object, we observed it move slowly down, then to the right, and then back and forth to the left. The object seemed as if it were being blown in the wind since it seemed to only move in the same area.;42.5888;-74.8096
