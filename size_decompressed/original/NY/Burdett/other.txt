It seemed to be moving at a pace equal to a typical jetliner, but when I got past the trees to get a real good look at it, it was completely gone.  The lights seemed to pulse rather than flash.  Mostly white but some were blue, green, and red.  The area past the trees would've given me a perfect view if it was a jet...thusly my curiosity.;42.4399;-76.8331
