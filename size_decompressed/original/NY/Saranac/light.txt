It does not appear to be high enough to be a star and it appears to make circular motions . I' I've lived here  a long time and never saw anything move like this. Probably nothing but I thought I'd  report it. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness reports here, but we do observe that stars appear in all parts of a clear sky.  Our suspicion is that the witness is observing the planet, Venus, which is quite prominent in the western sky in the early evening.  PD));44.7069;-73.7459
