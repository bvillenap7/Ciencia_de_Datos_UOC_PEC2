No sound. Too bright to be helicopter or celestial object. Moved rapidly. Spotted near Binghamton, NY. It was a bright circle of bluish-white light hovering what looked to be a few miles away from my house.  It was too bright to be a star or any other celestial object. It did not move until about 45 seconds later, in which it started moving rapidly in a westward direction.  To me, it appeared to be moving faster than any helicopter.  Also, the light on the object appeared to be too bright to be a helicopter at that distance.  The object made no noise at any time.;42.196;-75.7548
