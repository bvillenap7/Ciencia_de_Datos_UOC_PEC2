I was out for a walk on the 15th of May 2007 and taking pictures around the area of Rexford and Clifton Park, NY. I was looking at a hydro-electric dam and thought it would make a nice picture. At the time, I hadnâ€™t noticed anything in the sky. When I got home and uploaded the pictures to my computer, I noticed the disc-shaped object above the dam.;42.8524;-73.8701
