I have many more photos and two videos.  I am reporting this because friends in CA captured this orb without knowing it, as did a friend in NY and CT, and it's very obvious it's not a camera flaw, since we all have different phones.  I can't believe more people aren't discussing this - perhaps because it couldn't be seen with the naked eye.;42.8524;-73.8701
