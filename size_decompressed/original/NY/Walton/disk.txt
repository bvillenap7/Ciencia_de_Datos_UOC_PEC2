Saucer shaped craft with green lights flies across highway;2005-01-19 22:00:00;2 seconds;Saucer shaped craft with green lights flies across highway My fiance and I were driving into town on Route 10 in Walton, NY. As I was driving I glanced into my rear view mirror and saw a saucer shaped craft with green lights fly across the highway very fast. I didnt want to tell my fiance what I saw because I couldnt really believe it myself, but I wanted to see if she saw it too. She didnt. What I saw that night was very strange.  Just to clarify, I am in the medical field and do not use any illegal substances of any sort. What I saw was unbelievable, but definately something. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
