15 second sighting of 2 ufo’s in Walton, NY by 4 friends.;2019-07-04 21:00:00;15 seconds;15 second sighting of 2 ufo’s in Walton, NY by 4 friends. I was having dinner and saw the two ufo’s immediately over the mountain across The Valley around Dunk hill.  I immediately told my friend about the phenomena, because when I first saw it it was so unusual looking, that I could not mistake it for something else but an ufo. We saw them first coming towards us   They probably came around half a mile if our location.  When all of us starting to look at the ufo’s they started first going backwards towards the east and then with an incredible speed into the stratosphere that we could only see the fireball faintly, and then disappearing in a second totally.  While all this happening there was no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.1793;-75.1543
