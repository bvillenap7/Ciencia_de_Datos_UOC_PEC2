3 orange/red balls of light moving across the sky;2018-04-14 20:15:00;5 minutes;3 orange/red balls of light moving across the sky Saw 3 red/orange glowing objects moving south to north.  The first two stopped and then a 3rd one came up behind them.  They looked like fire but there was no flickering like fire.  Just a steady, bright orange/red light.  There was a plane flying from west to east that was in the vicinity at the same time.   I'm 50 years old and have never seen any thing like this.  They were moving fairly quickly and were not planes, lanterns or balloons.  They were less than 5 miles away and did not make a sound.  I could only hear the aforementioned airplane and nothing else.  Can't explain it.;42.1793;-75.1543
