As of 21:02 hrs, still located north northeast in the sky.   Multiple jets showing trails of exhaust flying through these blue crafts formation.  Most likely above lake erie/Toronto;42.6350000000001;-79.0455000000001

Multiple witnesses. 15/20 Blue, cigar-shaped, craft appeared the same location, due north in the night sky, appearing to hover and blue lights flashing the length of the crafts.  Animals in area, although normally noisy, had gone silent.   Aircraft flew around the location as if investigating.  Appearing over Lake Erie, seen between the trees in my backyard, in the same location as reported on the 20th.   Astronomical star charts are not in the same location as the 20th, which makes me believe these are not stars for a few reasons:  star locations are not in the location as previously reported, google sky maps do not show these stars as constellations or any known stars, and the colors are blue only, and move in a pattern that are not consistent with stars, satellites or faa-regulated aircraft.;42.6350000000001;-79.0455000000001
