Low hovering/flying triangular craft with flashing lights seen between Buffalo, NY and Fredonia, NY.;2010-04-17 22:12:00;1 hour;Low hovering/flying triangular craft with flashing lights seen between Buffalo, NY and Fredonia, NY. My boyfriend and I were traveling SW to Fredonia, NY from Buffalo, NY.  We were on the thruway and saw what looked like two very bright white lights with a flashing red one between them.  I thought nothing of it thinking it was a radio tower.  We approached the Angola rest stop and the lights appeared to not be attached to anything but just hovering.  We passed the Angola rest stop and actually drove past it (the craft).  It appeared to be about 10 stories off the ground.  We saw the underbelly of the craft and it was triangle shaped.  It had three bright lights on each corner of the triangle and there were two bright white lights on its belly, one longer than the other, there was a red flashing light between those lights.  As we passed it (at about 10:12 PM), I continued to look back and the craft’s front light looked like a spotlight- it had a light cone.  It rotated and then disappeared in place.  It didn’t fly away, it faded away.  Like it went into the clouds, but! there weren’t any clouds that night. As we continued to drive, I saw what I can only describe as was a flashing red and blue star in the distance. It jumped a measured distance across the sky in bursts.  It was very fast. As we approached the Fredonia Exit we saw the flashing lights move closer.  Suddenly very close.  It didn’t have its lights on anymore but it did have blue and red flashing tail lights. The underbelly of the craft looked indescribable.  It appeared to be dimly lit with a light source below it flashing slight colors.  It disappeared around 11: 10 PM or so.;42.6350000000001;-79.0455000000001
