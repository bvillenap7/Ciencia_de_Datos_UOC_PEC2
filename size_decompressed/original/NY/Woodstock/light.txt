30-50 star-sized lights moved independently in a single-file line straight across the sky  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-06-18 04:05:00;2 minutes;30-50 star-sized lights moved independently in a single-file line straight across the sky directly above us at 4 am. While camping on top of overlook mountain, (night was mostly clear with some scarce, thin clouds) my girlfriend and I both witnessed a precession of around 30-50 lights, about the size and brightness of a star, moving single file in a straight line across the sky. An absolute PIN straight line. The lights were moving independently of one another (didnâ€™t seem to be fixed to something) and were in two groupings (lines) of about 20-25 each. No noise accompanied them, they all moved together faster than an aircraft but not quite as fast as a meteor. Seemed to all be going the exact same speed. Our eyes followed them until they disappeared behind scarce cloud cover at the opposite horizon. Not sure on direction.;42.0346;-74.1106
