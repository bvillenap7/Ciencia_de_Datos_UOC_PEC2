Two fireballs flying over New York;2012-08-16 21:00:00;5 minutes;Two fireballs flying over New York Me and my friend and my relative were walking back from a restaurant to my house and saw two fireballs in the air moving very fast and they just disappeared out of no where and we were like what was that and we were shocked and after 2 minutes of standing there wondering where it went it came back but only 1 came back it seemed like the two fireballs joined together it looked bigger.  The thing was a weird color it looked yellow  or orange or red. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.0346;-74.1106
