UFO over nuclear reactor- 14 helicopters around it;1988-08-15 23:00:00;1 minute;UFO over nuclear reactor- 14 helicopters around it 4 people, driving north on Route 9, saw a large rotating circle of lights, flying over the area of Indian Point Nuclear Reactor (restricted airspace) on the Hudson River. I counted 14 helicopters flying around it. Cars were stopped all along the road to watch the incident, but we didn't stop, for some reason. This definitely happened in August of 1988, but I can't remember the exact date or time (evening). ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.2575;-73.9464
