2 triangle objects Rte 32 on Ulster/Greene county line;2012-02-10 21:00:00;20 seconds;2 triangle objects Rte 32 on Ulster/Greene county line I was driving NE on Rte 32 right about where the Ulster/Greene county line is @ 9:00pm.  Looking up at sky while driving to see if I could observe any stars to determine if I thought it would start to flurry before I arrived home (Catskill). Road is not highly populated w/homes & street lights are few and far between so it was quite dark.  I was the only car on the road.  As I looked up, 2 triangle shaped objects went right over top of my car in a northern direction (I went back next day w/compass to check this out). I was shocked at how low they were - barely higher than the trees lining the road - and that I hadn't heard their engines.  Put my window down a bit to see if I heard anything but it was completely silent - as if they were gliding. They weren't going super fast - again, just kind of gliding thru the air. One was behind the other so close they were nearly touching. I hardly think any type of planes would be flying so dangerously low or that incredibl! y close to each other. There was a light on the front tip but I cannot remember color.  On the tips (wings?) yellow lights for sure. I believe a light on the back as well but am not positive about this. Went back next day in daylight to see what was beyond the trees to my left (the direction they were headed) & if it looked like a place where 2 planes could have been gliding in for landing. It was a field but I couldn't imagine these large objects could or even would land there in total darkness.  I'm so mad at myself for not grabbing my iphone & taking a picture. But it all happened so unexpectedly the only thing running thru my head was a bunch of confusing questions and the inability to look away - I was awestruck.

Triangle of lights over NYS thruway near exit 20.;2014-07-31 21:30:00;2 minutes;Triangle of lights over NYS thruway near exit 20. We were driving down the nys thruway near exit 20 and saw 3 bright lights in the sky in a perfect Triangle formation.   At first we thought it may be a plane but the lights were stationary and too far apart.   Then we thought it may have been a tower, but on closer inspection there was nothing under the lights and it was directly over the highway.   It was hovering over the highway and making no noise.   We drove right under it.  It did not move. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.0717000000002;-73.9694999999997
