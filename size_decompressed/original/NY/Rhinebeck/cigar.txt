A dark cigar or disc descending, stopping and then going straight down;2008-06-10 00:00:00;10 seconds;A dark cigar or disc descending, stopping and then going straight down. I was 2/3 over the Kingston Rhinecliff bridge into Dutchess County.  As I scanned the horizon I saw to the ESE a craft descending at a shallow angle towards the WSW.  It Stopped for a split second and then went straight down behind the treeline of a hill 2 or so miles distant.  It appeared to be black or very dark gray and approx 50 or 60 feet in length or diameter(it could have been a disc rather than a cigar shape. There is very little traffic in that direction at that time of the morning and I doubt anyone else had seen it from the bridge.  I'm giving an educated guess that it went down about a mile due East of Rhinebeck, NY.   I drove around for a while looking for it or anyone that may have seen it but no luck. ((NUFORC Note:  There is an airport in the vicinity of Rhinebeck, NY, where antique aircraft are based, but we doubt that any of them look like cigars.  PD));41.9272000000001;-73.8888
Thin black cigar descending below treeline;2008-06-10 07:37:00;5 or 6 seconds;Thin black cigar descending below treeline I was eastbound about 2/3 over the Kingston Rhinecliff Bridge.  I saw to the ESE a black thin cigar (or disc on edge) descending at an angle then stopping for a second then going straight down below the treeline about two miles away.  I went to where I thought it went down and drove around asking everyone I saw if they had seen anything.  No one had.  I went home and called the local State Police barracks on Rte. 9 south of Rhinebeck to report it.  They were amused and said they hadn't had any other reports.;41.9272000000001;-73.8888
