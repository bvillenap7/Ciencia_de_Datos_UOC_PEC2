I stepped outside for a cigarette and heard a strange dull humming. For a second I thought it might have been the sub pump in the basement kicking on, but then I realized the sound was coming from above the trees. I looked up and thought I saw a large commercial aircraft (at least the size of a 737) in trouble (because it was so low). Then I realized I should have heard much more noise than I did, and that it seemed to be moving below stall speed for a craft this size. It looked like a equilateral triangle with three white lights at each acute angle. I watched it glide overhead and leave. About an hour and a half later, when my boss and I went to get in his car and leave, I heard the noise again. He asked me, what the hell is that and just like in a bad alien flick I said, they're back! Whoever they were, I don't know. But the object passed right over our heads, which I guessed was only 120 ft. in the air. It looked like a solid black or dark triangle. Another unsubstantiated sighting (or a folie a deux) to some, a mind-bender for me and my boss.;41.9272000000001;-73.8888
