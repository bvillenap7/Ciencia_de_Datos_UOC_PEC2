6 traveling campfires going NW to NE the night of the Full Moon 8/21.;2013-08-21 21:50:00;15-18 minutes;6 traveling campfires going NW to NE the night of the Full Moon 8/21 I was letting my dogs out before bedtime when I noticed something bright in the NW sky. I put my dogs in and grabbed the binoculars.  When I went back outside there were 2 bright orange and yellow objects that looked like flying campfires about 30 degrees above the horizon. They were flying at the same rate of speed as they stayed the same distance apart. They left my sight in the NE sky. Then I looked to the NW and saw 2 more exactly the same coming across the sky. One was a little higher than the other, but again kept the same speed and stayed equidistant apart. Now I was debating whether to run in the house and get my camera with the telephoto lens, but was worried I'd miss something. Sure enough 1 more appears in the NW sky and heads NE. It looked exactly the same. The top changed shape like a campfire would but it was basically a triangular fire with a flat bottom. This left my sight & 1 last one traveled through. I called Vassar College Observatory but no one saw it.;41.9272000000001;-73.8888
