sighting in Rhinebeck, NY 1989 Rt. 9 - Taconic State Parkway;1989-06-01 16:00:00;over 30 min;sighting in Rhinebeck, NY 1989 Rt. 9 - Taconic State Parkway Late one afternoon of 1989 I was on my way home from work.  I had an approximately 45 minute ride which took me through the town of Rhinebeck, NY.  Lots of traffic, as it was rush hour & many people were on there way home.  Traffic started to slow & it became dark, as I looked out my window I realized that the sky had gotten very dark very fast, and people were stopping their cars, pulling off to the side of the road.  I looked up and was surprised at the sight I saw.  Hovering above us was a huge, very dark  almost black, object,chevron shaped, very large and covering not only the road but buildings on both sides of the road.  The sky was completely blocked out it was that large an object and although I am not sure exactly how high up it was, nothing could be seen around it.  Dark gray/black underneath...silent, not a sound did I hear from it and moving extremely slowly.  There were some lights underneath, but I did not count them or take note of any color.  To me they were just bright, but small lights.  People were pointing up, and some were out of their cars or nearly stopped in the roadway.  This object continued moving forward slowly along Route 9 East, heading towards the Route 9G intersection, East.  It sped up a bit, but never any sound could be heard and it disappeared heading towards the town of Red Hook.  I later heard reports of it being sighted on the Taconic State Parkway heading South.
