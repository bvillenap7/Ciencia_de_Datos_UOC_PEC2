From a distance it appeared to be at least the size of a basketball and glowed very bright neon green.  No tail or streak.  Would guess it fell at 40 to 60mph didn't seem super fast.   Disappeared in the woods.   Went searching but found nothing.   Also the winter sky is oddly purple tonight and somewhat lit.
