Disc shaped or might be cone as its slightly blurred, over the hills in Ellicottville, NY on 9/26/20 at 429 pm. Got two pictures at two different angles.  Didn’t notice it until later.  Black and/or Silver, must have been moving fast as it is the only thing in the picture that is slightly blurred. There were 3 of us at the time and people in the Ellicottville Dog Park, but I took the picture on the way in, and parked a distance away from everyone else.  Based on the dimensions probably about 30-50 feet wide.  Can't believe I didn't notice it at the time, but simply didn't look up and took a long range shot.  Buggers.;42.2959;-78.6594
They're back and there's more;2020-09-27 17:55:00;1 minute;They're back and there's more Accidentally captured a picture of  a UFO,  while focusing on amazing fall foliage.

Black and/or Silver, must have been moving fast as it is the only thing in the picture that is slightly blurred.  Posted report.  Then looked at a different photo, and realized I have one an hour later with 3 uniform objects higher in the sky, which blown up show that all have highlights on the left hand side as if sun is shining off of metal or something shiny.  Actually, looking closer at the cloud cover, there is actually 7 possibly 8 that are the same size and uniform in shape.  The last photo is on the opposite side of the same ridge as the first 2 photos where one was lower and very clear in the sky.  Freaky. Way too large to be drones.  At least a mile away.;42.2959;-78.6594
