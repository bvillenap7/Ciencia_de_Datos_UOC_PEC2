Saw bright star like object during the day directly overhead.;2007-07-21 08:30:00;5 minutes;Saw bright star like object during the day directly overhead. Went outside at work and was looking up at the nice blue sky and noticed a very white intense circle of light directly overhead. It was the size of the brightest star at night but it didn't twinkle. This event occurred at 8:30am. It was stationary and when some small puffy clouds went past it, you could still see it. I tried getting someone else to witness, but it was gone after a few minutes.;42.9297;-78.7434
Bright light curves upward, disapears;2008-12-04 21:30:00;1-2 seconds;Bright light curves upward, disapears At apx. 9:30 P.M. on Dec. 4, 2008, as I was walking through the parking lot at work I turned to check that my lights were off.  As I turned, to the west, I saw a bright object streak across the sky.  My first thought was that it was a very bright meteor, when suddenly it changed direction, curved upward, gained altitude and disappeared.

Three bright orange/red distinct lights of UFO's spotted in skies in western New York on 8/12/2011;2011-08-12 22:40:00;minutes;Three bright orange/red distinct lights of UFO's spotted in skies in western New York on 8/12/2011 On Saturday, August 12, 2011 at approximately 22:40 EST, my sister pounded on my front window of my house to get my attention to come outside.  She seen a UFO!  I went out without shoes to see not just one, but three and yelled for my son, who is 21, to come outside also. The UFOs appeared to be lights high up in the sky that were orange/red in color.  Two preceded the third and third appeared larger in brightness. They seemed to be heading east though moving upward.  The two disappeared, then the third. This seemed to take several minutes. My sister took a photo with her cell phone of the first one she seen (the other two had been blocked by the trees initially) however, the photo does not look like the same as what we had seen. Also, of note was that my nephew said he and his neighbors seen one two nights earlier. It was that night and then again the night of our sighting that I noticed helicopters flying in my area well after midnight.  Even though this occurred near the Buffalo Niagara International Airport, helicopters are normally not heard so late at night.;42.9297;-78.7434
