It was like a nightmare.It was so low, on top of the trees, and you could here the swishing sound from the leaves.It made a humming sound,big size of a foot ball field.It was turning all colors bright pink ,blue,white,green.I thought this is it! we're finished! it's the end of the world.I saw something years ago twice but not this close!.I know there is something out there cause My brother and I followed it.This thing stayed in the air for at least an hour or meven more.It separated into pieces and it vanished into thin air.I never slept that night.I bet others that saw this thing in my area and here in westchester county that night...couldnt either.Like my mothers says, it's in the bible..in the last days there will be sighns in the skys.;41.1684;-73.8498
