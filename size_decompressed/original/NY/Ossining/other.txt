DRIVING IN MY CAR I SAW AN UNUSUAL FLYING OBJECT;1984-07-19 18:00:00;3-4MINUTES;DRIVING IN MY CAR I SAW AN UNUSUAL FLYING OBJECT MY 8 YEAR OLD SON AND I WERE DRIVING DOWN ACKER AVENUE IN OSSINING NEW YORK WHICH RUNS EAST TO WEST WHEN I SAW WHAT LOOKED LIKE AN AIRPLANE OVERHEAD BUT IT MADE NO NOISE.  IT HAD LARGE WINDOWS ON THE SIDE WHICH MADE ME WONDER WHAT IT WAS.  I WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED IT HAD THE ROAD I WAS ON RAN NORTH TO SOUTH.  LATER I HEARD REPORTS OF SIMILAR SIGHTINGS IN MILLWOOD WHICH IS THE DIRECTION THIS OBJECT WAS FLYING TO OR SLIGHTLY BELOW MILLBROOK.  I HAVE BEEN TO NEW YORK AIRPORTS AND SEEN PLANES IN THE SKY BUT NEVER ONE THAT LOOKED LIKE THIS.  IT WASN'T A STEALTH BOMBER EITHER IT LOOKED MORE LIKE A PASSENGER PLANE, A STEALTH BOMBER DOES NOT HAVE WINDOWS ON THE SIDE.  I WAS VERY CLOSE TO THIS OBJECT, IT WAS FLYING LOW.  MAYBE THE OBJECT BLOCKED PEOPLES HEARING.  THAT'S WHY REPORTS COME IN THAT PEOPLE CAN'T HEAR THE CRAFT.  I ALSO SAW THIS REPORTED ON UNSOLVED MYSTERIES.  IT WAS NIGHTTIME.
