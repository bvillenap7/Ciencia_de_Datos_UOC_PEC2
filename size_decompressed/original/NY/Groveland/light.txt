A bright White Light seen by 4 teens in 1988;1989-06-01 19:00:00;1 minute;A bright White Light seen by 4 teens in 1988 It as about 7:00PM on a summer night in 1988 or 89 (I was 15). Some friends and I were outside playing basket ball and it was just starting to get dark (dusk) when we noticed a white light in the sky. It looked like the sun slightly breaking through some clouds. We joked about it being a UFO and then continued to play ball. About 1-5 minutes later the light was so bright that it instantly lite up the area we were at and we could barely see above us due to the brightness, however I recall seeing a almost saucer type outline. Then just as fast as it happened, it raised into the clouds and shoot off. I could see the light as it faded and it looked like in may have landed sever 100,000 feet away, but I am not sure it landed or just faded. The funny thing was, there was no sound or wind.
