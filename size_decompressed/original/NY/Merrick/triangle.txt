The object had sharp edges which we distinct against the clear blue sky. The object was moving too slowly to be a plane or helicopter and was completely silent.  The base of the object was wide and the top was the point of the triangle which rules out balloons. Got a decent picture . Wish I could post it here.;40.6665;-73.5455000000001
