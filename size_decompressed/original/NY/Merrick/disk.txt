My friend and I were riding our bikes in North Merrick NY on October 1st 2008 at about 1:00 AM. It was a quiet day with lots of clouds, it rained later that day. We were just riding around and we noticed a large metallic disk with a rounded top just hovering. There was no sound emitted from the object. We saw it for about 5 seconds and then at gold beam shot down from the bottom of the object and then the object shot off as fast as Iâ€™ve ever seen anything go. It was like it disappeared completely in a flash. We never saw it again and we called 2 of our other friends to look for things like broken twigs or burned things. We took 4 cell phone pictures of the area were it was seen which we can not upload. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
