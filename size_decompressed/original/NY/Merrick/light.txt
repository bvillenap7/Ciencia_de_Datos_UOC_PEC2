5 orange flashing UFO's.;2014-08-28 22:03:00;5 minutes;5 orange flashing UFO's My father, my two brothers and I were leaving my uncles house after visiting a new edition to the family.   When we walked outside, I looked into the sky thinking there was a bunch of stars out but the lights I saw were flashing and gliding in a downward motion.  They were 3 flashing lights in one area, another on the far left and another in the far right all gliding through the air.   The 3 in the middle were making a shape of an upside down triangle and they kept gliding towards the ground until they left our sight .;40.6665;-73.5455000000001
Silent red light moved across the sky from south to north, changed course, and went off to the northwest.;2015-07-25 21:50:00;1-2 minutes;Silent red light moved across the sky from south to north, changed course, and went off to the northwest. I was outside watering the lawn and saw a reddish light in the eastern sky, moving from south to north.  It was silent and it moved more slowly than a plane.   As it reached an area to the north, it changed direction and moved to the northwest and disappeared.   We are college educated mature homeowners and have lived on Long Island our whole lives.;40.6665;-73.5455000000001
