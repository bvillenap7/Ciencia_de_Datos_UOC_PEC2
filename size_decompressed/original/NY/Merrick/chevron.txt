At 21:00 or so, i stepped onto my deck.  It was  crystal clear, cold night. looking up at the  stars.  I  observed a dark (BLACK) chevron shape obscuring the stars as it  moved silently and slowly, across the  cold night sky. Moving from north and traveling due south, it made no sound whatsoever. Slowly, its shape 'cranked', as the wings began to swing inward.(like variable wing  geometry type  aircraft).  Speed remained the same and  noiseless. As the  shape of the object changed, it became slightly sleeker.  I observed  a peculiar  fluorescent contrail rolled off the trailing edges of both 'wings.'   It looked like two yellowish twirling pasta noodles, (each roughly 1\3 the  length of the  trailing edge of the objects wing'), that  fell slowly away from the  dark object. These slowly grew darker, and dissapated, but kept the  twirling, rolling motion, until they were completely gone. Within about 1-2 minutes, it was out of sight and headed out over the water.;40.6665;-73.5455000000001
