Red sphere abruptly disappeared.;2020-07-26 21:15:00;45 seconds;Red sphere abruptly disappeared. Family (two adults in their mid 40s and two children ages 13 and 11) in backyard.  We all observed a bright red, spherical light moving vertically (upward) in the sky overhead.  Observed the red light for approximately 45 seconds until it abruptly vanished.  There is a fair amount of air traffic in the area (notwithstanding COVID) as we are close to JFK International Airport, however, we have never observed an aircraft “disappear” as abruptly and without traveling across the horizon as air traffic typically does.  There was no sound.  The sky was partly cloudy, however, we were able to observe all air other traffic through the clouds as they traversed the sky.;40.6665;-73.5455000000001
