Father's Day Sighting, Long Island, NY;2007-06-17 19:30:00;2 minutes;Father's Day Sighting, Long Island, NY My daughter, girlfriend and I we’re eating dinner in my backyard when I spotted what looked like a brown/rust balloon rising to the west. Then I realized it wasn’t a balloon because it was moving way to fast on a steady line eastward. It passed over my viewing spot and continued to the east. Other than an oval shape I could not make out any wings, nor was there a vapor trail. Neither of the other two witnesses could identify the shape.
