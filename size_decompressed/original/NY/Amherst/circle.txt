Four circles of white light about the size of dinner plates flying in the sky doing formations;2006-03-25 21:00:00;2 minutes;Four circles of white light about the size of dinner plates flying in the sky doing formations I went outside with my dog so she could do her business and I saw floating in the sky from the left over my neighbor's house then over my house four circles of light flying freely above the clouds.  I could tell they were above the clouds because their outlines were blurred slightly from the cloudy sky but the circles were still very bright and visible.  The circular white lights were about the size of dinner plates and were flying around independently and then all joined into one light and then split off into four again.  They did this twice in my presence.  I didn't stay outside any longer once my dog was finished because frankly I was a little spooked by the occurance and just wanted to get inside. My dog was not phased in the least. There were no visible beams as if the lights were spotlights, absolutely no noise, and the lights seemed to me to be more solid than any spotlight would be as well as very free and unbound by any movement limitations that a spotlight would have as a spotlight originates from a source on the ground.  These balls of light were very free moving.  I am a college educated, professional person who is not claiming to know what these lights are but I do know what I saw, and I know they were very strange and seemingly intelligent.
