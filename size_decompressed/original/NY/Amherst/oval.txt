They pointed out the moon, and one really bright “Star”.  It just looked odd, it had an orange hue.  Then I saw four more lights added, but two were moving, and as they came closer I saw that they were helicopters.  The helicopters seemed to be circling to see the stationary lights.   I noticed two people on a walk across the street, and they too stopped and just stared for a really long time.  That made me feel a bit better since I knew it wasn’t just me.   Throughout the whole thing, the same lights were still in the same places but every now and then it would seem to dart out a little bit, but then return to the exact same location.   Actually that movement was what really baffled me because it would quickly dart sideways and then return to original position.  I’ve never seen anything in the sky move that way.   I watched for about 5 minutes.  The only reason I stopped watching was because all of a sudden there was a super thick all-encompassing fog/cloud that took over the whole sky.  Honestly, even the cloud cover that occurred looked abnormal it was as if a thick auditorium curtain was being pulled across the night sky.;42.9966;-78.776
