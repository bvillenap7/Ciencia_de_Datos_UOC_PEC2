Bright Green sphere moving slowly west Amherst (Bailey ave.), Tonawanda.;2016-09-20 20:00:00;5 minutes+;Bright Green sphere moving slowly west Amherst (Bailey ave.), Tonawanda. I was driving to pick up my daughter in Amherst, NY, and in the sky a green sphere shaped object was moving slowly west toward Tonawanda.  It seemed quite large considering it was a good mile from me (I was near Millersport.  It was roughly at Bailey Ave) no sound.  lost sight of it, but when I picked up my daughter, she had seen it also.
