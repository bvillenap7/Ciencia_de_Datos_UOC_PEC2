Orb- brilliant white on Rt 17, NY;2002-08-22 23:40:00;5 minutes;Orb- brilliant white on Rt 17, NY I was driving on a clear dark evening (the rain ended an hour ago)north on Route 17 when I saw a giant orb hovering on the shoulder of the highway. Initially thought it was a streetlight but Rt 17 never had streetlights.  Then noticed that it was so bright white but not blinding & unlike any light I ever saw, didn't have heat/distortion waves & was a perfect, uniform brilliant white.  I was going 65 in the fast lane & there was a car 10' ahead of me also traveling the same speed on the slow lane.  Suddenly this orb shot out ahead & above us, crossing the 2 lane highway to the meridian.  Both myself & the other car hit our brakes.  While it crossed us, the orb had a puddle effect with 2/3 feet like Caspar the friendly ghost & it looked like waves undulating across its surface.  Then it shot directly up into the sky so fast it blinked out.  The other driver & I gunned our cars!;41.3280393442623;-74.1894196721312
