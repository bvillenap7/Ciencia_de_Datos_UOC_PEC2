Large rectangular object with bright lights, flying low, extremely loud, and moving fast above us.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD;2000-06-18 23:06:00;1 minute;Large rectangular object with bright lights, flying low, extremely loud, and moving fast above us. Although I do not recall the exact date, I was with another person.  I did not know how to report a sighting, so it has been unreported for many years.   I was younger, having a sleepover with a friend in which the lights were pitch black, with only the alarm clock luminous.   At about 11:06 P.M. there was an abrupt interruption to our sleepover, a noise that sounded like a large train above the house, we saw circular lights and it was flying extremely low.  It was not hovering, it was moving.   With the lights we could make out the rectangular shape of this huge object moving fast.  This event lasted for about a minute, and abruptly came to an end, with everything back to normal, as if nothing had happened.  But it must have felt like 5 minutes due to our fear.   We immediately recognized the event as a ufo.   We were extremely scared, but realized that we were lucky because we figured that more people would believe us since we were together at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  Hoax??  PD));41.3280393442623;-74.1894196721312
