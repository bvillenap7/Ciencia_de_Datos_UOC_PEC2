Flying saucer lifts off from field without a sound or trace.;1975-10-15 19:00:00;1 minute;Flying saucer lifts off from field without a sound or trace. On a fall evening, just before Halloween, in 1975 my cousin and I ages 11 and 12 years old went for a walk in my neighborhood.  There was a field that sat between the cul-de-sac at the end of my street and Route 17M. From the field suddenly lifted off a flying saucer with red and white lights about as bright as car taillights.  It shot up approximately 50ft. and hovered just above the treetops for a few seconds before accelerating at lightening speed on a northerly angle. There was no sound or smell or fumes or trail whatsoever.  We would have never known that the saucer was in the field had in not lifted off the ground. We were stunned (no, not by a ray gun) and speechless.  However, we continued on our merry way and never told anyone about the sighting.  We never even discussed it again until adulthood!

A light blue rigid disk object with dome decended in an out of control, flip-flopping pattern about a mile from my point of view.;1985-09-06 14:45:00;20 seconds;a light blue rigid disk object with dome decended in an out of control, flip floping pattern about a mile from my point of view. Approximately 1,000 feet u and maybe as much as one and a half miles distance from me I observed a light blue disk (classic saucer with small dome in the middle) falling somewhat out of control.  I would best describe it's falling pattern as zig zagging as though it was made of an ultra light material being affected by the weight of air.   It clearly had a distinct rigid fo with a dome in the center.  It had to have been at least 30 feet in diameter and mayb to 10 feet in height.  I observed it flipping and falling for about half a minute before it disappeared behind the horizon of pine trees about half a mile or more away.  I believe I was facing west as I was walking north on the highway.   My taxi had just broke down and my fair was walking down the same road ahead of me.  I don't believe they observed what I saw.

Disk with two dim red lights, surrounded by a blue aura, with a light whirring sound, almost inaudible. ~300ft in the air;2015-07-20 21:00:00;40 minutes;Disk with two dim red lights, surrounded by a blue aura, with a light whirring sound, almost inaudible. ~300ft in the air On the night of July 23, 2015, I was arriving home from a friend's house and I heard a small whirring sound, ignored it and entered my home.  I had to run out to bring my cat back inside my house, and I noticed a strange blue light all around the back part of my yard, so I try to get a better view and I see two dimly lit red lights and a blue aura surrounding an oblate disk about 300 or so feet in the air, so I instantly ran inside to get a witness, that witness being my mother, by the time she came out in disbelief, it was still there, and I tried to take a video of it but I had 4% battery life,  I was able to capture the full image of the disk but before I could save the video or stop the recording my phone turned off.  Weirdly enough, when I re-entered my house my phone turned back on but with double the amount of battery life and all of my pictures, videos, and apps deleted off my phone.  I was stunned by seeing this, I felt very strange and later on I.  The night I heard the whirring again and again but I never saw the object again.   Also to add in, my cat was no where to be found and still has not returned home, or eaten out of her food bowl we left outside that night.;41.3280393442623;-74.1894196721312
Disk with rounded top and tower-like structure on top, smaller red lights and larger greenish spot light, hovers in place for 30+ mins.;2015-07-22 23:45:00;~15 minutes;Disk with rounded top and tower-like structure on top, smaller red lights and larger greenish spot light, hovers in place for 30+ mins. The object was in the distance, late at night, not so easy to make out as to exact shape.  It basically hovered for a long time.  It seemed to be getting closer for a few minutes, but then did not appear to have actually moved.   We both thought it looked like a classic hat-and-brim shaped flying saucer, as depicted in films, with red lights at either edge and a greenish-blue larger light, almost like a spotlight directed towards the ground, in between the red lights.   My husband thought he could make out a tower-like structure extending up over the object with a red light at the top.   I attempted to shoot video with a small camera, but it was too dark object just appears as a whitish blob.  Canâ€™t rule out a drone, but appears large from a distance.;41.3280393442623;-74.1894196721312
