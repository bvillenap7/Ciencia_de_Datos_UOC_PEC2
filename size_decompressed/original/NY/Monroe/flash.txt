Ball of light flashing over Monroe, NY.;2012-03-14 23:50:00;2 to 5 seconds;Ball of light flashing over Monroe, NY While driving down Rt 6 Harriman mountain into Monroe a bright spherical flash was observed in the northwestern sky.  To my eyes it seemed like what I would imagine ball lightning to look like but the passenger in my car  (I was driving) saw more detail.   He said he saw the light emerge from behind a cloud before it exploded into into a bright white sphere.  He also perceived a bluish color to the light before it exploded.   I don't think the duration of the sighting could have been longer than a few seconds.  We kept our eyes glued to the sky and saw no signs of any plane or helicopter.   We were near an auxiliary West Point Military site.;41.3280393442623;-74.1894196721312
