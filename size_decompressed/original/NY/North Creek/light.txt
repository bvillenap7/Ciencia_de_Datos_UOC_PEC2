On Sunday August 27th sometime between 9.30 and 11pm I, my son and my nephew were outside on the deck at my moms house in North Creek New York.  We were observing the stars because it was such a clear and beautiful night.  I witnessed and pointed out to the boys that I saw a satellite moving from North to South-southwest.  It was a steady bright white light moving very fast with no sound, and none after.  At first I thought it might be the space station because I have seen that before on nights when the news reported that it would be flying over.  This seemed smaller and slightly less bright than the space station and moved just like a satellite.  The boys both witnessed this with me. As the light moved to the south of us it went out and reappeared further south a few times which was strange because there was not a cloud in the sky and stars in the vicinity were still visible.  Then it did a sudden 90 degree zig zag type move at a speed that a plane or jet, even military would not be capable of.  At least not one that I know of.  It was something out of a science fiction movie the way this light was zig zagging,  The distance and speed and angle of the turns was Like nothing I have ever seen.  After about 15 seconds of these types of lightning speed moves the light became steady again and continued south over the horizon until it was out of sight.;43.7809;-73.9891
