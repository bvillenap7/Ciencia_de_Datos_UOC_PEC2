Two unknown sets of amber lights;2012-06-16 22:45:00;approx. 4 minutes;Two unknown sets of amber lights Last night at approximately 10:45, my husband and I  viewed 2 sets of unusual lights.  He (being an ufo skeptic) was the one who first spotted them and he said they looked &quotstrange&quot. There were 2 sets of 3 amber lights flying in unison.  The amber lights were in a line with a blinking light underneath the center one.  They were directly overhead when first spotted then traveled due East. They stayed in the same position the entire sighting, one in front, the other following directly behind and there was no sound.  I observed them through binoculars and couldn't make out any solid craft but the lights were definitely amber.  We observed them until they faded from sight.;42.6468;-78.8768
