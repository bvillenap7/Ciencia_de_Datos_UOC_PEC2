Unusual bright zig-zagging lights in the Eden, North Collins NY sky.;2008-08-08 00:00:00;15 MINUTES;Unusual bright zig-zagging lights in the Eden, North Collins NY sky. While trying to get my humidity swollen porch door shut A bright white light in the sky caught my eye. It was a good distance away. It was probably twice the size of the largest star. The craft was hovering for a good 5 minutes in a erratic fashion. It was like it was struggling to stay in one place. I could see blue strobe type lights around the horizontal perimeter of the craft. Then near the bottom of the craft (about the lower third) of the craft, I could see orange/pink glowing.These did not strobe, but they did appear to increase and decrease in intensity. Next, a second craft appeared, and although difficult to see through the trees, appeared identical to the first craft. Suddenly, they began to speed up and for the next 5 minutes approx, they began zig-zagging up, down, with great acceleration. It was almost like they were chasing each other for fun. Next I heard a jet engine, but it wasn't coming from the crafts. A jet began flying toward them. Next, the 2 crafts appeared to merge into 1 craft. As the jet got closer, the single craft appeared to accelerate downward and disappeared.;42.6468;-78.8768
