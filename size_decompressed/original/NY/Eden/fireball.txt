Spherical, silent fireballs in the night sky spotted by two people driving.;2014-05-30 21:50:00;5 minutes;Spherical, silent fireballs in the night sky spotted by two people driving. While driving, we spotted 2 flickering orange (fire colored) spherical, slow-moving silent objects in the sky.  Since I was driving, I couldn't get a good depth perception.   I knew right away that they were the same things I had seen sitting on my deck a few summers ago only that time there were three and they were much lower.   I would guess that they were larger than a basketball but not bigger than exercise ball.  Both times, they were moving faster than the wind current and seemed directed. I never did figure out what they were and still can't.;42.6468;-78.8768
