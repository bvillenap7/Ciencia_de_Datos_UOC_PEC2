disks in a circle overhead;1999-06-15 20:00:00;3 minutes;disks in a circle overhead i walked to my car to get something and on my way back i noticed the five or six craft just sitting there in the sky.  they were in a circle.  the color was gold.   it was so long ago but i do remember that were police cars down the street as if investigating the incident.   they were right overhead though and i ran inside to get some witnesses but they were gone we came outside.  but, as i'm writing this, i realize my memory of the incident is not a total recall.  although it's something my mind's eye will never forget, it's hard to describe.   that weren't that far overhead, really.  i remember being in shock and awe for quite a while.
