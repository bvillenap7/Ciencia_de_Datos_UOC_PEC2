lights seen night before blackout;2003-08-13 23:59:00;5 seconds;lights seen night before blackout not a shooting star! I was sky watching when i spotted a bright light in nw sky thought i had seen end of meteor when it came on in a flash in middle of sky i looked to the west and it flashed again! i  saw a few meteors  but none as bright and none of their lights went out and back on or went across the whole sky. could this have anything to do with blackout!!!!! did anyone else see it?;42.0411;-76.6236
