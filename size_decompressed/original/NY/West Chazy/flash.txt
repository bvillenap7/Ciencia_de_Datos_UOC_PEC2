We were driving on the Highway 87, going north, and we noticed a bright white light behind us.  It would flash white every second and seemed to be following us.  The object looked like it was flying close to the road, as we saw it pass over a bridge.  We thought about a plane on an emergency landing, but it stayed behind is for too long.  We where driving at 65 miles/hour.   The object was flying close to the trees and was following the curves of the road (left to right).  We were 5 in the car and everybody saw it.  We are all sober, as,well.  It got really close to the car (100 feet), and then got further.;44.7971;-73.5055
