Bright orange glowing object that hovered, moved across the sky and down, then disappeared.;2004-12-30 20:30:00;3 minutes;Bright orange glowing object that hovered, moved across the sky and down, then disappeared. I had taken my dog for a walk on a cloudy evening.  It was dark, but you could see the clouds were low.  I was in my backyard, just letting my dog through the gate when a bright light caught my eye.  It appeared to be a large orange glowing object.  It moved in straight lines across the sky, back and forth both hovering and desending.  It had gotten smaller by the time my husband came outside and I pointed it out to him.  He ran to get some binoculars and I watched the object move away and down, then it disappeared.  My husband tried to get a look at the object with the binoculars, but it had moved too far away.  At first I thought it might be a meteorite or worse yet some type of plane crash, but there was nothing on the news of any events of this nature.  This has to be the strangest thing that I have ever seen.  When my husband first came outside I said to him you see it too, don't you?.  If I had not seen it, I would not have believed it, so I have not told a lot of people about this.  My husband and I are both in our mid-40's, we are working professionals and were not under the influnence of alchol or drugs of any kind.  I have not visited this website before seeing this object and would not have if I hadn't seen whatever this was.;42.1113999999999;-77.9422000000001
Bright fireball with a tail in daylight over Wellsville, NY.;2012-10-22 18:20:00;1 minute;bright fireball with a tail in daylight over Wellsville NY. The fireball was wide and long with a orange to white color that glowed in the bright daylight sky.  It lost the tail rapidly and turned to a small tube shape within a minute.   The speed was amazing and the sky was bright and clear to witness this object.  There was not really any sound or smell in the air as it passed over my house.  The hunting dogs were watching it as well due to the brightness in the sky.  It was heading toward Canada.  Today was a sunny clear fall day.  Amazing.;42.1113999999999;-77.9422000000001
