Unknown slow mvoing silent triangular object spotted in non-military area.;2003-07-24 22:00:00;2 minutes;Unknown slow mvoing silent triangular object spotted in non-military area. My wife and I were driving on 86 west on our way to Olean to see my parents for the weekend.  It was a warm summer night and as we were driving we saw a low light in the sky about 5 miles in the distance. As we got closer we kept asking what is that?  It was moving slowly in the direct path of the expressway.  We had the sunroof open on the jeep and looked up as we passed directly under the object.  It was probably 100ft above my vehicle.  It did not make a sound, and was triangular shaped.  We both thought it was probably a stealth but couldn't imagine it flying that low, or that slow, and why it would be in the area. Growing up in Olean I never saw a single military craft .;42.1113999999999;-77.9422000000001
