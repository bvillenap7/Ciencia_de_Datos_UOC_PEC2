Green glow cresting trees 50 yards away hovering then going away.;2009-07-18 22:00:00;10 seconds;Green glow cresting trees 50 yards away hovering then going away I was camping with my children and girlfriend  in 09 at our favorite spot, about 1 mile into the woods  far away from the other campers.  It was about 10 P.M.  I walked to the other side of the camp fire (putting it to my back) when a green formless glow came over the treeline (about 50 yards away).   As soon as I saw it I called to my kids and girlfriend to look. Who where in shock.  What we all saw was a silent formless green glow crest the trees  (I mean right over the trees not miles away) hover for a few seconds and then go back down the same path it it crested the trees.  Needless to sat I don't think anyone slept much that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));41.2006;-73.5715
