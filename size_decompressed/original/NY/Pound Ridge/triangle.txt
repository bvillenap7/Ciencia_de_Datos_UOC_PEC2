Dark gray triangular object spotted very close, saw it clear as day.;2016-01-02 17:00:00;30 seconds;Dark Gray Triangular Object spotted very close, saw it clear as day Traveling home via car saw at first hovering lights so assumed it was a helicopter flying very low.  Glanced up and saw several round shaped lights (green/red/white) far too separated from each other to be a helicopter.   I stopped the car and focused my eyes on the object which was almost directly above me, maybe 100 feet over the trees.  I saw a massive, very dark matte gray generally triangle shaped object.  It appeared to be several times the size of standard plane.  The object had wing-like protrusions on each side much like a very modern/angular military aircraft might appear.   It moved very slowly (15 mph?), completely silent, then increased speed rapidly after 10-15 seconds, again no noise what-so-ever.  My car window was open and I was very close to the object, no possible way to not hear engine noise.;41.2006;-73.5715
