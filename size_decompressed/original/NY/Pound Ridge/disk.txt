I was lying on the couch in my room when out the window I see what at first looked like an airplane, but it wasn't moving like one. It didn't move in a straight line like a plane would, but in a sort of smooth zigzag formation. In the darkness I could just barely make out it's rounded disk shape. I got up and looked out the window to get a closer look, but it had already gone/flown away. Then, however, I looked up at another point in the sky...it was a little red/white light that looked like a star, and i thought it was. But then I realized it was moving. It took awhile for me to realize it wasn't a star it was moving so slowly, and almost as soon as I realized it wasn't, it sped up dramatically and dissapeared over my house where I could no longer see it. I'm not sure if the two were connected, or maybe it was the same craft, or two different crafts.;41.2006;-73.5715
