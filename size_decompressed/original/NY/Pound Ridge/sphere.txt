It was going fast then slowed down.  blinked twice and let off a smaller sphere. I was sitting in my hot tub out side on the night of July 18th around 10:30.  I was looking up at the stars when I noticed a shooting star traveling very fast.  It then began to slow down.  I realized that it was not a shooting star, but a spherical craft with a slight glow.  it continued to slow down untill it stopped.  A light on it blinked twice and a smaller sphere flew out of it.  The larger object then flew away at an incredible speed, taking only a couple seconds leave the atmosphere.  Meanwhile the smaller sphere began to descend.  I quickly got out of the tub, ran inside and got some binoculars.  I found it again and got a better view.  It also was a sphere, it had a slight blue glow and it flew in a slow, unsteady fasion.  I watched it untill it went past the tree line.  It was pretty scary.;41.2006;-73.5715
