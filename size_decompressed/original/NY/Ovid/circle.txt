Bright orange lights moving very fast;2012-05-19 22:15:00;5 minutes;Bright orange lights moving very fast I live in central NY (ovid, ny), half hour north of Ithaca NY.  Last night at 10:15 a series of very bright orange lights moved very quickly from east to west about 35 degrees above the horizon.  They did not blink, they all moved at about the same very fast speed.  There were a total of four and I could see three at one time, two pretty close to each other from my vantage point.  There was no noise whatsoever.  They came from the east and when approx in front of me either faded or moved south - either would appear the same to me.  The tree line blocked them from time to time.  I did take a video but all you can see are orange dots (when I optically zoomed the dots became disks though blurry and I could not hold the camera steady especially at that setting);42.6898;-76.7941
