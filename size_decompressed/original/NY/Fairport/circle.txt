A circle craft being followed by two military jets which were close together and NO SOUND from the 3 of them.;2013-07-12 11:30:00;1 minute;A circle craft being followed by two military jets which were close together and NO SOUND from the 3 of them It was Friday morning, 7/11/13 the sky was milky white when coming from the East a small circle craft with a possible orange yellow light flashing around in a circle like a lighthouse going in a circle around the top. Just behind a little way behind were two what appeared to be military jets side by side that looked to be following the craft.   What made it strange there was not a sound from the military jets or the craft. I knew it was not a plane as I saw no wings or sounds.   The craft suddenly made a sharp turn to the North which really was not like any plane would ever turn.  The two jets also turned to the North in a way that any jet would turn could see them both dip down and turn North still keeping a distant from the craft.  Again no sound.   All three disappeared into the milky white clouds.;43.0908;-77.4348000000014
