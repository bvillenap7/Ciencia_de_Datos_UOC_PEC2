I was out on my usual nightly walk I take between 1am and 3 am, I had just came onto what is known as the canal path and about 20-40 minutes into my walk down the path I came upon some strange noise, like it sounded like a vacumed whistle. The sound was coming from arround the bend of the path. I crept up to the bend and stopped probally about a 200 hundred feet away from what appeared to be a  dark colored sphere like object that appeared to be hovering only a few feet above the water. It moved back and forth across the width of the canal for about 2 minutes and then all of a sudden it illuminated a flash of vibrant colors.I could only pick out white,purple,red and maybe blue also. It began to rise slowly and it hovered for another 10 or 15 seconds, then the noise it made grew louder and the sphere lit up with a yellow glow and all of a sudden another sphere rose up from above the trees and hovered for about maybe 10 seconds and then the two spheres suddenly just darted upwards and faded from sight or possibly got to a certain elevation shut the lights off. I've never seen anything like it in my life. I may be 17 but I know what I saw, there may have been others who've seen it as well but not that I know of. There is many houses arround the area and the part of the path I was on has a thick barrier of trees and then there is a housing track, as well as houses accross the canal.;43.0908;-77.4348000000014
