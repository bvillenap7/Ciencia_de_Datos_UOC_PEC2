At first thought to be a plane flying very low and quite, however they joined together to make just one circle of light, and then again split into 2...what is odd is that they were low to the ground for the size and also hovered.  I had thought perhaps I could not get a clear picture of the second one (I was trying to convince myself that they did not join together) because of tree tops and clouds in the sky.  Got to my drive way and looked up...it was one of the clearest evening skys all summer.  They just vanished into the sky as if they turned off all lights, puff and gone.
