It then proceeded to duplicate to it's exact left. The duplicate ball of light continued to glow where as the other dimmed out of sight and then the other dimmed as well then where the first ball of light was seen another brightened out of nowhere perhaps the same as the first ball of light. Each had a duration of about 10 seconds or so, they weren't really high in the sky but just over the horizon.  Then about a hour later that same night I was sitting with two of my friends who had seen the previous even as well, a bright silver-blue light hovered in the sky for a good 5 minutes making no movement but only radiating. It was similar to the size of a large star, it then proceeded to move to the right keeping on a straight path I followed it for a few moments, then lost sight of it for about 30 seconds or so because of the village buildings obstructing my sight, and it was gone.;43.0908;-77.4348000000014
