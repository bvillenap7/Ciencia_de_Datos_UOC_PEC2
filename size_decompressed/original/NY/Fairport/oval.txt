Flying orb of light casts an eerie silence.;2013-09-05 23:45:00;20+ minutes;Flying orb of light casts an eerie silence Bright oval light flying around 1 mile off the ground and between 1.5 and 3 miles in distance from my back yard, this object is easily visible.  Given the distance whatever created this light was about the size of a school bus in diameter.  This object was changing course in an instant moving at very high rates of speed also hovering completely still and always stayed within view, movement that indicated intelligent changes in direction, for example the light would gain altitude dramatically followed by a pause hovering completely still then a much slower decent, after that the object moved around from east to west in more of a diagonal pattern, the type of maneuvers no conventional aircraft could come close to, and this is definitely not an object being pushed around by wind.  It also changed colors from bright white to red/amber, the flying oval appeared to distort into rectangular and triangular shapes then quickly return to an oval, the entire time there wa! s trail of dimmer light coming down off the object like a tail or an exhaust beam always pointing towards the ground.  The object made no noise and there was a strange silence in my neighborhood no noise from the usual crickets and night time bugs that are always quite loud here at night, only the occasional passing car on a nearby road broke the silence. I brought my girlfriend outside to make sure I wasn't losing it..  she saw it as well. I attempted to record the event on my cell phone, while recording I could see the light on my screen, after when i reviewed the film there was nothing but complete blackness, another strange thing is I was talking during most of the recording( describing the object) and while there was some other random noises like me standing on some bricks to get a better view, my voice was not on the recording at all!  This thing was out there over 30 mins and it was still hovering in view when we went back inside.;43.0908;-77.4348000000014
