SHOCKING;2011-08-26 11:56:00;45seconds;SHOCKING I was coming out of my apt complex club-house gymnasium after a late workout, looked into the sky to see if it was clear hoping for a nice day tomorrow and I saw what it appeared to be a bubble on flames, moving randomly an without a pattern, I could see all stars around.  I am totally shocked!!  It hovered-like for about minute although it could have been up there before i looked, I took 2 picture with a 5mp blackberry, once pic wasn't centered into object so all i see is black sky, the other pic show a triangle shape object like a funnel with some type of lights in corner parts.  This object disappeared in a blink of my eyes, must have gone up so fast or simply went transparent in front of my eyes. I have never seeing anything like it in my life, that's 37 years.  This was no plane or aircraft, nothing can possibly move that way that fast... unless an aircraft exploded in the air tonight above upstate new york and pieces are falling from the sky as we speak.  This is the most amazing thing I have ever seeing, ever.  I intent to have my picture zoomed and cleared somehow, it's definitely a funnel-triangular shape in picture yet it looked to me like a flaming bubble.  It disappeared so damn fast I still can't believe it, it was there and then it was gone.  This object was possibly around same altitude at which planes fly or possibly higher.;43.0908;-77.4348000000014
4 red/orange lights/fireballs in sky over Fairport NY;2012-07-11 22:10:00;10 minutes;4 red/orange lights/fireballs in sky over Fairport NY On July 11th 2012 I was standing out on my driveway in Fairport NY when I saw 4 red/orange glowing balls or lights in a diamond formation.  There were fireworks in the area so initially I wasn't alarmed until I realized these 4 lights seemed to be moving in a formation, flew slowly, and were too high in the sky to be flares or fireworks.  At this point I ran in my house to grab my 2 girls who were still awake at the time, they are 12 and 14.  They too watched with me and tried to film them with our Iphones but there was too much surrounding light.  They diamond formation changed as this continued so it did not appear to 4 lights connected to 1 craft but rather 4 separate crafts or lights. after about 10 mins 1 fadded into the sky as if it were moving away from us, shortly later the other 3 did the same with 1 reappearing briefly.  There appeared to be a small plane flying directly toward the lights at one point and I would be certain they were seeing what we were.  I checked the news the following morning and saw no reports until I googled it the following morning and saw this was not the 1st time similar lights like these have been spotted in the area.;43.0908;-77.4348000000014
