UFO sighted in Carle Place with fascinating lights!;2007-08-29 21:00:00;30 minutes;UFO sighted in Carle Place with fascinating lights! My fiance and I were driving on Glen Cove Road, approaching Jericho Turnpike and I spotted an object roundish oval shape. It had blue lights on both sides-right and left sides. It had a red light on top and my fiance saw a red light on the bottom. Our daughter seen it too. It flew over us, no noise quite. Then as we headed onto Jericho Turnpike we saw it hovering over us. It was standing still in the sky at one point. Then my fiance started to chase it..we followed it and it headed towards Hickville..then it turned into 2 balls of clear colored lights and disappeared-the red and blue lights were no longer there-it changed colors. It was amazing and I never seen anything like it before.;40.7533;-73.6177
