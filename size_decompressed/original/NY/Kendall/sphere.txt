I witnessed a UFO sighting with my boyfriend, in western New York between 9:00PM-9:10PM. Description- *What I saw was spherical. *It looked like it had three parts. *The color was grey. *It had rapidly flashing lights. *The lights were the color yellow. *The lights were brighter than the street lights. *Height: Just above the tree line. *Distance from us: approximately 200 yards away. *Clear skies  *We were outside  When we looked up it was stationary and rotating.  Then within seconds it flew across the sky moving upward.  The UFO was way faster than a plane. The other witness will also be submitting a report.   Thank you for your time.  I'm very happy I found your website, we were not sure where to report.;43.3319;-78.0277
