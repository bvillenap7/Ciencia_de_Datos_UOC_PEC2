Hi I am a driver for ((brand name deleted)) and at approximately  7:35 am on June 11 me and a co-worker witnessed what can only appear to have been a UFO.  We were heading south bound on the NY state thruway (RT.87).  The saucer shape object appeared in the sky near a cloud and was still.  It was pretty high and I would estimate it was at least the size of a commercial plane.  The object was the brightest metal I ever seen.  It stayed motionless for about five seconds and simply vanished, as if it popped into the atmosphere and then popped out.  I called a local radio station and they told me that several other people did claim to have witnessed  this.;41.5333035561875;-74.0484793741117
