Huge object hovering over New York;2008-01-21 04:00:00;5 minutes ?;Huge object hovering over New York 1/22/2008  My husband is a Truck Driver. We were traveling on I-84 heading East in New York. Both him and I saw a set of four very large lights about five miles away? before the toll bridge crossing over I-87. We did'nt think much about it except that it was strange. They did not move. Than seemed right after that this THING was hovering right above us! When we got close there were a lot more lights! It seemed to be surrounded with bright white lights. The shape was that of an OVERSIXED STEALTH, maybe 10 times bigger. It seemed to span across the entire Interstate. This was nothing like we have ever seen. Since we drive a Semi Truck we could not get a better look or stop. If we could have stopped I would have taken a picture. If anybody driving that way at around that time seen this thing, could you please post it. Maybe you could describe it better from a car. It really was amazing !;41.5333035561875;-74.0484793741117
Two bright clouds fall from sky over Newburgh,NY.;2012-03-27 05:05:00;20 minutes;Two bright clouds fall from sky over Newburgh,NY. At first sight there was a glowing, bright vertical rectangle that shimmered as it slowly spread out and down from 40 degrees above the Catskills horizon.  It was so bright and strange that my wife and I got out of bed and went to the sunroom for better view.  After a few minutes I got my binoculars and continued to watch the first shape glow and writhe but not moving across the sky like cloud. At about 6 minutes we watched a slowly falling trail of sparks, like slow motion meteor, coming from above and just to the left of the first shape.  As the trail passed the altitude of the first shape it spread into a glowing cloud of shimmering particles.  The two shapes hung in the atmosphere slowly dissipating and growing dimmer until I stopped watching at about 20 minutes.
