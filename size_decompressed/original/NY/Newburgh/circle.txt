Longer than a football field. Saw it for 25min. In front of a friends house we saw a one large mass. In the sky approx one 1/4 of a mile from where we were standing. It was 200ft in the air. And looked longer than a football field. It made no noise. And it was going slow. During the duration of us observing it. It did not look like any plane i ever saw. I lived near an airforce base. So i know the thing we saw that night wasn't a plane nor helicopter!When it was moving the best way i can describe it. If you took a piece a graph paper and a pencil and a ruler. And connected the lines on the paper that's how it was flying. It turned on its lights white lights about 10 mins into us watching it. Then it shut off its lights. Then it glowed solid green. The shape of a cigar. Then it slowly went out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));41.5333035561875;-74.0484793741117
Fight paths  were unnatural and closer than planes would safely fly near each other no sound of engine;2005-11-09 04:50:00;20 minutes +;Fight paths  were unnatural and closer than planes would safely fly near each other no sound of engine 1st craft streaked left and down at a 33 degree angle with a bluishgreen white streak, then dipped down and back up in a u shape (path resembling a knitting needle) then rocked back to front as a ball would if dropped in a bowl.  Craft then hovered.  We pulled the car over to make sure craft was stationary.  It hovered and spun from right to left with a ring of white,green and red lights on bottom.   We proceeded in the car and the craft soon darted horizontally a short distance then remained stationary.  2 IDENTICAL crafts joined from the right the 3rd semi circling the 2nd one closely.  the 2nd craft then moved toward us silently and then started to move ahead of us.  we followed it and as we sped up to stay with it it would speed up also, as if it were toying with us!  Needing to get to work we had to cease following.;41.5333035561875;-74.0484793741117
