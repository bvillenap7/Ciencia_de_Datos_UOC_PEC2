What my husband and I observed was a large ball of light similar to a shooting star (although it was 10 to 15 times larger in size than your average shooting star)moving East to West as we were traveling home on Saturday May 6, 2006 at 10:20 PM.  We were approaching Rtes 32 and Rte 300 in the Town of Newburgh, NY when we spotted the sight.  I stared at the light (once I spotted it) following it for approximately 30 seconds before it shot up now in a northerly direction, disappearing leaving a tail at the end that eventually vanished also.;41.5333035561875;-74.0484793741117

Strange lights in photograph. lights not seen by naked eye prior to taking pic;2014-10-08 06:02:00;1.6 seconds;Strange lights in photograph. lights not seen by naked eye prior to taking pic On the morning of Oct 8, 2014, I was photographing the lunar eclipse from 0515 hours until 0620 hours.  I took approximately 80 pictures.   Upon inspection of my photos I noticed an object in just one photo.  The object was two red lights with a very bright white light in the center.  The three lights are connected by what appears to be a line of light roughly resembling a sign wave with brighter spots in the upper apexes of the wave.  You can see no solid object connecting these lights.   The rest of the picture is well focused with no motion blur or lens blur.  This object is in one picture only of the 80 I took so it is not a piece of hair on the lens or light leaks in the camera.  I would like to submit this picture just to have it analyzed and get a possible answer!  Itâ€™s very strange.  The object in the picture was not seen outside of the picture by naked eyes;41.5333035561875;-74.0484793741117
