15-20 tiny points of light moving over Newburgh, NY.;2010-12-08 21:20:00;3-5 min.;15-20 tiny points of light moving over Newburgh, NY. I observed 15-20 dull yellow color objects that at first glance appeared to be stars. After a few seconds I realized the points of light were moving together in a loose formation. First they were moving in a sort of V formation but as they moved over me the formation was moving and changing shapes. It almost seemed as though they were moving around eachother but they were moving around eachother way to fast to be any kind of aircraft I've ever seen. I saw them 3 times within a few minutes. The first time I saw them they were moving from the north to the south. The second time was east to west and the third time was very far off from the south west to the south. The weather conditions were very dark and cold, 25 degrees. The sky was very clear. There were other aricraft in the air as there normaly is. Nothing else seemed out of the ordinary.;41.5333035561875;-74.0484793741117
