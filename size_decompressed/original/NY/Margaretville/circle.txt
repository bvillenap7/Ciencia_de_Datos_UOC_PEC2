On Sunday, October 28, 2007, sometime around 11:15pm - 11:30pm, I saw (for about 3 seconds) a green glowing spear falling from the sky in Central New York State.  It did not come straight down, but rather at an angle.  There was no tail to it.  There was no beam leading to it like from a search light.  It was not transparent.  It was as though there was a pulsing to it around the outside edge of it.  From my vantage point it looked as big as a fifty cent piece.  It came down more than half a mile away.  I can not say if it came down on my side of the mountain or the other side since my view was obstructed.    The state police say no one reported anything.  I need to know if anyone else saw this.  I would like to know exactly where it came down.;42.1859;-74.6217999999999
