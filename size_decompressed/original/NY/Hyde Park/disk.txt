flat saucer-multiple white lights on the bottom,going on and off,one at a time, in rotation. light in center of disc (red?) altitude es;1976-07-15 14:00:00;5-10 mins;flat saucer-multiple white lights on the bottom,going on and off,one at a time, in rotation. light in center of disc (red?) altitude estimated at no more than three or four hundred feet,heading due south at approx thirty miles per hour. At the time,there was a sound very much like a diesel locomotive taking a slight strain.. Unfortunately, there were railroad tracks with a slight grade a half mile away. I believe,however,that the sound came from the UFO. This object was seen just off Route 9, from an apartment complex directly across from the Roosevelt mansion in Hyde Park,New York. The day was bright and sunny. Yes,I know,this was 29 years ago. I had never believed in saucers until I saw this one. The next day,I got a book on the subject and saw a sketch of the exact UFO which I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
