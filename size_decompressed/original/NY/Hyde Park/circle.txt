Small, flashing, moving light over hyde park;2010-02-08 00:00:00;unknown;Small, flashing, moving light over hyde park It was about 12pm ((sic.  12:00 a.m.)), and my dad happened to be looking out the window when he was going to bed, when he saw something. He called me in and told me to look out the window in the sky.  We live in the country so there is not a lot of light pollution. There was an object that looked to be a star, but slightly larger, and not sure how exactly far away.  It would move in a small area around it, in a zig-zag motion, and it went up and down, and in circles.  It was also flashing colors slowly, such as pinkish purple, red, green, and blue.  It wouldn’t move all the time, but every so seconds it would move.  I know it couldn’t have been a star because of the way it was moving, and just the colors were very vivid.  It seemed to have move up quite a bit from when we first started to watch it.  There was a couple planes, I believe that have also been in the sky, but this was no plane.  It was a very strange sighting, but also a little difficult to see because of the distance.;41.7868;-73.9063000000001
