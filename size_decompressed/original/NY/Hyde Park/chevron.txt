My sister was in her back yard when she heard a whooshing sound, very loud.  She turned to see the B-2 bomber (Stewart Air Force base is just across the Hudson River from her location, so military planes are not unusual) hovering motionless for at least two minutes.  It was very low (maybe a few hundred feet), had no lights at all, and made a whistling, whooshing sound.  She ran into her house to grab her camera, and when she returned to her yard it could be heard, but not seen.   An hour later she saw it a second time, this time moving unnaturally slowly, but not quite hovering, as it made it's way east.  She took pictures which are yet to be developed.  Three days later the local newspaper ran a picture of the B-2 supposedly taken over Hyde Park, N.Y. (my sister's hometown) with a short blurb about the bomber flying over the town.  This is the first I've heard of the plane being able to hover.  My sister was absolutely sure of this, as she witnessed the craft at very low altitude, less than quarter mile distant for at least two minutes. The B-2 is exactly the shape as the Hudson Valley U.F.O. from the early 80's, and is entirely similar to countless reports of boomerang, or chevron shaped sightings.  I believe this is significant.  I have never heard of the B-2 being able to hover, yet my sister is a sober and sane person, I believe her story completely.;41.7868;-73.9063000000001
