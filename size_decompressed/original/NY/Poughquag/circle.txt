Fast moving saucer like object over Dutchess County.;2001-01-20 09:53:00;5 minutes;Fast moving saucer like object over Dutchess County. I saw an object which appeared to be red in color from the bottom and was moving from a north westerly direction heading south east. The object was moving very fast and was shaped like a saucer. The object was moving very fast and suddenly took off with such speed it vanished from sight within an instant. I have seen aircraft and used to be a pilot and have never seen anything like this nor have I ever seen an object just vanish from sight just as quickly as it appeared.;41.6253;-73.6808
