At first I thought it was  plane but the light got closer.  I jumped up,looked through the window and saw a large triangular shaped object slow and make a long swooping turn,almost as if were gliding.  It was dark, but I saw 3 or 4 lights on the object. The lights were steady not flashing and were red,green and white. This object was way to low to be a plane in my opinion.;41.6253;-73.6808
