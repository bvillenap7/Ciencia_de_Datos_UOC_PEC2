I was driving on the Taconic State Parkway North Bound. About a quarter of a mile before the Beekman exit I noticed lights in the sky.  As I approached the exit I kept staring at it.  The object was very low to the ground but yet it was moving very slow.  When I got off the exit I pulled over to take photos of it but I couldn't get a good angle to shoot it.  The shape of  looked like this using the lights as a line connection:  O blinking red | O----------O----------O very bright steady white | O blinking red   The object made no sound at all.;41.6253;-73.6808
