Then we noticed flashing lights red, green and white (or yellow).  Object was stationary for about 45 minutes and then seemed to slowly drop slightly in the sky and then again become stationary.  Through binoculars we could see the lights clearly flashing in a clockwise pattern, and at times seem to speed or slow up.  Object also seemed to turn to face different directions, at least it appeared to as it looked like the lights sometimes were aimed in different directions.  There was no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the sighting is not inconsistent with the many reports we receive of celestial bodies, principally twinkling stars.  However, a celestial body in the northeast sky would not descent, it would appear to rise and move to the right slowly, as the Earth rotates.  Without triangulation, or a star chart, however, this is only a guess.  PD));41.6253;-73.6808
