NO SOUND UNTIL IT WAS  OUT OF VIEW. CAUGHT AN AIRCARFT  IN THE CORNER OF MT EYE THIS AM.  BRILLIANT BLUE CLEAR SKY. nOTICED IT WAS FLYING EXTREMELY FAST AND LOOKED STRANGE.  ON STUDY IT  HAD NO WINGS.  iT HAD NO SOUND UNTIL AFTER IT HAD GONE FROM SIGHT.  IT LEFT NO VAPOR TRAIL.  IT APPEARED TO BE STAINLESS STEEL AND WAS HUGE AND QUITE WIDE.  I WOULD GUESS  AT LEAST TWICE THE LENGTH OF A FULL SIZE PASSENGER AIRLINER AND IN COMPARISON MUCH WIDER. IT WAS TRAVELLING SO FAST THAT I HAD TO TURN  180 DEGREES APPROX TO FOLLOW IT'S PATH WHICH APPEARED TO BE FROM THE EAST FLYING DUE WEST.  IT DISSAPEARED FROM VIEW WHILE I WAS WATCHING IT JUST GONE.   NO ONE I HAVE MENTIONED IT TO  SAW ANYTHING RESEMBLING THIS.;42.1607;-77.7916
