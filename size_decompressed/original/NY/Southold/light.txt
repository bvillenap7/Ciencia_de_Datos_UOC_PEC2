Fast moving, flashing bright blue light seen on eastern Long Island;2019-07-05 23:15:00;2 seconds;Fast moving, flashing bright blue light seen on eastern Long Island I was lying in bed, looking out the window (although I was NOT half-asleep) when I saw a bright blue light (much brighter than a plane) flash twice, then disappear, then reappear and flash another two times, and then it left my field of view. It was moving fast, much faster than a plane.  My guess is it would traverse the entire sky in 10 or so seconds. I would think it was a meteor, but meteors don't flash multiple times at the same brightness, and I would think it was something like the ISS but the ISS was not visible from my location at the time.  Maybe some sort of secret SpaceX launch?  Anyway, I'm not super sure this was an alien craft, I just wanted to put this out there in case anyone in the area saw something similar.;41.0551;-72.4288999999999
