Sightings at Peconic Dog Park on Long Island New York;2015-10-21 17:00:00;10 minutes;Sightings at Peconic Dog Park on Long Island New York. At the Peconic Dog Park with dogs when I saw a metallic brown object the size and configuration of a brownstone building slowly moving north over the trees from the Hamptons.  Flew under aircraft flight paths.  Slowly advanced silently, I tried to get others to see it but they couldn't.  I watched as a red dome light went on and it turned left (or east) and slowly continued until it was gone. There have been previous times when I have seen pale white oblong objects traveling west very fast in flight paths.  These have been observed with me at least once with two other people.  All of these sightings took place at the Peconic Dog Park in Southold New York.;41.0551;-72.4288999999999
