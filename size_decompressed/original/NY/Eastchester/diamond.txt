Diamond shaped in broad daylight.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting by police officer, with video footage.  PD));2002-03-17 11:20:00;5 min+;Diamond shaped in broad daylight I am a Police Officer and was on patrol the above date, during a crossing detail when I saw an object hovering in the sky, in broad daylight at about 11:30am. I watched it for about fifteen minutes, thinking it was a hovering helicopter in the distance.  I zoomed in on it with my mounted dash patrol vehicle video camara and saw that it was a diamond shaped 'craft'.  I turned on the video and taped it for about five minutes, zooming in and out.   I had to follow it as it now began to move, so the video turns on and off during the five minutes as I re-focus and move.   Don't know who else to tell.;40.9541;-73.8085
Diamond shaped, mid day I videotaped it.;2002-03-17 11:33:00;3:32;Diamond shaped, mid day I videotaped it. I am a Police Officer and was patrolling on 03/17/2002 at 11:32am in Westchester NY. I saw something in the sky and videotaped it with the ‘In Car Video system that we just had installed in our patrol cars.  I used the magnification of 128 on the camera to see what it was.   When I realized it wasn’t anything I had seen before, I started taping it. The object was diamond/top shaped, and I followed it, moving my patrol vehicle several times to get a better picture.   The actual video lasts 3:32.   At one point a commercial plane flies past in the back ground.   I have had the video transferred to DVD and have taken pictures of the images from my screen so I can send them out as attached files.;40.9541;-73.8085
