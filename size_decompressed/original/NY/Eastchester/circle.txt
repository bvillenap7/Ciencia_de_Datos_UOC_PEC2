Staring out the window towards the east I had seen a small light travelling west.  Suddenly the light changed direction and traveled straight up and shot off towards the south in a matter of seconds.  It also appeared to have another light shoot out from it. I am curious if there were any other witnesses or if any of the local airports picked anything questionable up on radar.;40.9541;-73.8085
