Hovering UFO is observed multiple times in Slate Hill, NY.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star.  PD));2016-10-06 00:00:00;5 days;Hovering UFO is observed multiple times in Slate Hill, NY. I have been watching this thing on and off for several days.  At dusk, and sometimes late into the evening,  I have been observing a very bright light that seems to pulsate from white to red.  With binoculars, it is clearly a spherical glowing white orb or disk encircled by rotating red lights.  It hovers in the sky Southwest of my house, for 20 minutes or more, then disappears.   Last night I observed it, and watched it with my binoculars on and off for a hour.  It hovered in place, with the red lights rotating.  Some evenings it seems closer to my house, but last night it was the furthest away I have observed, yet the binoculars were able to pick up details and shapes quite clearly.  When I went to look later, it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star.  PD));41.3739;-74.4871
