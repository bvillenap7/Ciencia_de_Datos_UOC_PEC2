Shaking light that flew into the sky from an empty field;2000-11-11 05:00:00;2 minutes;Shaking light that flew into the sky from an empty field I was hunting and it was pitch black outside.  A white light across the way lit up.  It started to shake and then move forward.  The shaking and movement got quicker and then it lifted into the sky and was motionless.  You could still see the lights though.  The sky was clear and the stars were out and i was in a clearing in the woods.;41.3739;-74.4871
