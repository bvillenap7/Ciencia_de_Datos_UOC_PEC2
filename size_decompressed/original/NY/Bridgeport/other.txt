Luminous object tracking aircraft;2007-09-20 18:50:00;5 min;Luminous object tracking aircraft STATEMENT  At approximately 6:50 PM EDT on September 20, 2007 I was walking west on Hitchcock Point Road, about 75 yards east of where Chittenango Creek feeds into Oneida Lake in Bridgeport, NY.  I saw two large aircraft in the air, one traveling northeast, and the other traveling southwest.  They were in my estimation at about 35,000 to 40,000 feet in altitude.  Both were leaving heavy con trails, illuminated by the setting sun. I noticed a luminous dot at what I would estimate to be at least 1,000 feet in front of the aircraft which was traveling southwest.  At first I thought this was a star, but as I watched, I noticed that it maintained a fixed distance from the large aircraft, and tracked its position very accurately until both disappeared behind the tree line.  The luminous dot was slightly to the starboard side and in front of the large aircraft.;43.1551;-75.9717
