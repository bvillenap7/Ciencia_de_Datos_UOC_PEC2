After getting out  of my vehicle and looking up I saw green and red lights.  At times it was moving in a  circular fashion, then zig zag, then shooting up and down.  Its pace was like a happy being in the sky.  It also appeared to have a white light on it.   I went inside and grabbed my binoculars and came out to see more.  There it was still looking like a  star but far to twinkly and moving.  I moved my position to the back yard (where it was darker)and proceeded to watch for any change.  I see it appear to be dancing and changing shape into an ancient harp or a circular shape, then dancing again..... I don't know, the sky is very clear tonight with a crescent moon.... Go out and look.;42.9785000000001;-78.6260000000002
