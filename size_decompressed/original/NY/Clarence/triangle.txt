UFO seen going over Harris Hill Road in the town of Clarence, NY on the night of 09/03/2014, around 9:30pm.  I was driving toward an intersection and stopped at red light. Bright white light in distance was brighter than any planets, but not as large as moon. Upon starting to drive from red light, I noticed white light approaching pretty fast until trees on side of road obscured it.  Then as I drove, I saw a flat-triangle-shaped (point facing up) object that was larger than a plane would be, flying relatively low to ground, about as high as the highest treetop and then a little higher. Red and yellowish/white lights (2 on each side of middle point) blinked in a radiating pattern outward toward sides.  Object passed diagonally at a 45-degreeish angle from one side of road over and was then obscured by trees on left side of road.  Not sure of sound as my vehicle is loud.  No other witness in car (I was alone.);42.9785000000001;-78.6260000000002
