Balloon shape object, that appeared to have flames glowing within, traveling over Clarence NY 8/29/12;2012-08-29 21:40:00;1 minute;Balloon shape object, that appeared to have flames glowing within, traveling over Clarence NY 8/29/12 It was traveling about the speed of a plane in flight. It appeared to be like a balloon shape or bubble, and it clearly appeared to have flames burning within ...glowing flames within the body, I have never experienced anything like this in my lifetime.  We see planes all the time, we live within a few miles of the Buffalo/Niagara International Airport.  The object was traveling just to the North of us, heading East. This was not an aircraft.  This was something very strange.  Glowing light, that appeared to be glowing golden flames...I cannot believe I saw this.  It did not even appear to be that far away, not that high in the air.;42.9785000000001;-78.6260000000002
