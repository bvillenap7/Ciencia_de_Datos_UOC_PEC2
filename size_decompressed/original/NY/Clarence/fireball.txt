I woke up at 6:45 AM from my alarm clock, getting ready for the day. I was going to hit the snooze button, but all of a sudden I saw  a brilliant, bright light coming from a spacecraft or something that looked like the sun and that I had never seen before.  I was filled with panic and curiosity.  The object was hovering above the tree line of my forest. It was as big 50 full sized moons, and it looked as though it was very close to me, hovering, pointing at me! It couldn't have been the sun because it was bigger than I had ever seen the sun and as we all know the sun rises in the east!  After figuring this out I ran to the other side of the house and saw that at the east the sun had not even come up yet! I figured that I was just seeing things and I went back to bed. I woke up again at 6:52 ish, and dashed to the window.  I saw a few lights from where they were before, like something was there, but then as it went completely away.  Then, the shadow of the house came up showing that the sun had finally come up.;42.9785000000001;-78.6260000000002
