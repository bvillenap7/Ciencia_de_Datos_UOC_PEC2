Two lights similar to planes move erratically & rendezvous.;2016-02-14 18:30:00;20 minutes;Two lights similar to planes move erratically & rendez vous. My family was on our way home from a shopping trip to nearby Queensbury, NY. I was stargazing like I normally do when I get to ride home.  Everyone else was distracted with driving and video games. We were in between the Chestertwon, NY, and Pottersville, NY, exits on I-87 North.  I looked up and saw what at first appeared to be a plane judging by the flashing lights.  After watching the craft fly for a while it was obvious that it was not a plane, or a plane with new flight technology at least.  It appeared to flit like a moth would, erratically, almost as you would imagine a craft might appear if it were time traveling, punching a hole in reality from point a to point b.  I watched the craft for around 5 minutes, and saw another appear far to the right.  The first craft flew to the other one (they both flew in the same manner) and I lost them in the treeline.  I have seen these same crafts for years. I believe most people wouldn't look watch what appears to be a plane for more than a few seconds so they are probably often overlooked.   I will try to get a video asap since I see these so often.;43.7281;-73.8094
