As we got closer to Waterville we noticed this really big bright light just above the radio towers, (dont know how long it was there before we seen it) that are in between rt 20 w and 12s some what near the first set of wind mills, it looked. as we kept watching for about 10 mins, as it got lower and lower.  Then disappeared below the tree line.  This light was absolutley, not a plane or a star at all!!  We could not tell the shape with the naked eye.  Just a huge and extremely bright light,slowly going down.;42.9354;-75.3859
