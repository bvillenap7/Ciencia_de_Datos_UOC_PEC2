I was helping them take suitcases out of the trunk when I saw lights far away in the distance moving really slow. I figured it was something I just never saw before and I pointed to it and asked my grandfather (retired army guy) 'Grandpa what is that??  pause.... Well that would be a UFO  completely deadpan.  It was low in the sky and was approaching very slowly.  Dogs started barking all over the neighborhood.  We stayed outside and watched it pass over.   It was very large and oval and had multicolor lights around the edges that slowly rotated as it moved forward.   It very slowly went off into the distance (I think we watched it for a long time) and I ran inside and called the police (more because I was hoping they would say what it was) and the dispatcher said he was getting tons of calls and he was assuming everyone had a lot to drink this St. Patrick's Day.  The next four hours the sky was full of helicopters with searchlights.  The newspapers reported the next day it was likely ultra lights in formation.  I have no idea what it was but you could see the solid bulk of it as darker against the night sky.  It made no noise either, and the lights weren't in plane formation.  My grandfather read the papers the next day muttering obscenities to himself the entire time.  He was quite annoyed that the there was no reliable explanation.;41.0991;-74.0079999999999
