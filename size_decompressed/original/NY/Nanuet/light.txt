As I was walking the dog I saw a large object in the northern sky moving from west to east.  I was just above the tree line.  It was very large.  As big as a bus.  It was bright white.  The shape was round in front and round in back.  The front was larger than the back.  I saw it for a second and it was gone.  The height of the object was 1/4 the size of it's length.  It had no tail.  There was no noise.  It was not burning red.  It was bright solid white.  It was a clear night with stars out.  My first reaction was,  what was that.  Maybe it was comet, or space junk.  But it only appeared as a quick flash.  I called the police department to see if anyone else might have reported it.  Can someone tell me what I saw?;41.0991;-74.0079999999999
