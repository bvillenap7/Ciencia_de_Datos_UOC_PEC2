The object was getting closer when it sort of turned 90 degrees left and turned to its side and continued across the sky in that direction.children immediately went to get other witnesses such as my self for they knew this was definitely no plane!!! when i ran out side no noise was to be heard and the object was silver/crome and move at a great smooth way with no sound yet it left no trail as a plane or jet may.While watching this object with awe i could see what the the other witnesses were speaking of when they said the light was twirling and it did just that it was twirling not flashing.we watched the object continue out of sight and we began talking about the sighting.wishing we had thought to get the camera we watched around the sky for about 3 min. when we saw the same object again going in another direction coming from the direction we saw it leave and then leave in another. this was my first sighting in daylight and i was floored.;42.2744;-75.8469
