Craft hovered in place about 50 or 60 feet above the next parking spot, noticed a dark horizontal port (viewing?) on the upper portion of the bubble.  May have just taken off. Was returning from a relaxed trip to store on a nice sunny fall day. Stopped vehicle engine about 15 feet from parking spot and opened the driver's side window to listen, did not hear anything. Then I opened car door, but do not recall anything after that until I awoke in my living room chair with my glasses still on. No reports were made to law enforcement due to local disbelief & stigma. Was unable to obtain photos w/ digital camera as felt in a 'frozen' state This report made after possible 2nd visit by the creatures was made at 0130 on 26 Feb 09, am scared they may be coming again.
