PD));2018-08-30 21:15:00;15 minutes;Stationary Hovering Bright Light I had let my dog out in the yard and spotted a very bright light hovering low in the southeastern sky.  It had a reddish white glow and no blinking lights.  It never moved during the 15 minutes I watched it.  I went back into the house wondering what I had just seen.
