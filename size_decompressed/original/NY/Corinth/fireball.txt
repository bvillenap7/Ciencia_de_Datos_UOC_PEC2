Round Plasma fireball (orange/red) object moving in a north/north west direction, suddenly disappeared.;2014-08-20 20:30:00;3 minutes;Round Plasma fireball (orange/red) object moving in a north/north west direction, suddenly disappeared. My wife had stepped out for a smoke.  She started yelling for me to come quick.  So naturally I responded promptly.   Coming from the east and heading in a north/northwest direction was a single fireball object.  It was round in shape and orange/red in color.  It appeared to be actively burning. Almost like plasma or liquid fire.  It was lower in the sky than airliners cruise and moving slower than a meteor.  Then it stopped for a few seconds and disappeared.  It appeared larger than planes do even when they are landing at near by Saratoga airport. It really freaked my wife out.  Being a skeptic, she could not explain what she saw.  I on the other hand thoroughly enjoyed the sighting.   I believe I have seen other unidentified objects in the past.  Neither of us are a trained or active observer.  That will change, I'm sure.;43.2397;-73.8385
Orange Glowing Lights without any sound.;2014-09-22 19:30:00;5-7 minutes;Orange Glowing Lights without any sound. My wife and I were just next door at my mother in laws house.  I came home first, when my wife frantically called for me to come outside.   I believe there were 6 orange glowing lights in all.  We observed them looking south, and they were traveling towards the east.  They seemed to be following each other.   The first light suddenly stopped, and dropped straight down out of sight.  The remainder of the lights headed in the same direction as the first one, but then headed up and out of sight.   The entire episode lasted between 5 to seven minutes.;43.2397;-73.8385
