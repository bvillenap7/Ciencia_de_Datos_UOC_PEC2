After stopping the car, while using power lines as a reference the lights appeared to move in an outward direction, and finally disappeared.  The initial formation when we saw them was like the big dipper, with a hooked tail on the end.   At first, while driving, I thought it was the big dipper, but it was too low.  They slowly moved away from each other and disappeared.  There were no blinking lights, or white lights eminating from the yellow/orange lights.  It was a clear night with good visibility and when the lights moved away from each other, the light just faded away.
