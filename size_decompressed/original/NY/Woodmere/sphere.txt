video taken- flickering red orange spheres;2011-11-01 20:32:00;8  minutes;video taken- flickering red orange spheres I was inside a pizza place and saw several people outside looking at the sky.  I ran outside about 1 minute later and saw about 8 round bright red and orange flickering objects hovering in the sky about 1/2 a football field away from me.  They made no sound.  They looked like glowing balls and the closest ones moved away pretty quick. Other people took out phones for pics or videos. I ran to my car and got my video camera and proceded to take 2 videos ( 1.5 minutes and 22 seconds, decent quality ).  They look less red in the video then what my naked eye saw, so I mentioned while taking the video that they were red. 2 more caught up and they followed the others leaving in the same exact direction. I believe they were the size of a car. Here is a link to the video http://www.youtube.com/megahobbytube#p/u/6/FUBJ_kBYJ7s;40.6358;-73.7147
