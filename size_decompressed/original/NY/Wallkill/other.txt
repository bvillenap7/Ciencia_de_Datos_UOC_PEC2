Low flying, standing still above tthe trees bowtie unidentified flying object seen driving home from work;2010-11-11 17:00:00;4 minutes;Low flying, standing still above tthe trees bowtie unidentified flying object seen driving home from work I was driving home from work and in a hurry to get home when a car in front of me dropped down to less than 5 mph on my road.  I was annoyed by his speed and was wondering what the heck he was doing when I looked in the sky down the road and saw this object very low in the sky.  I was watching it ahead of me by a mile down the road until the car ahead and I were directly under it as it was not moving.   This object was a bow tie shape and very low right above the trees and completely silent.  It was just holding still above our cars over the trees and road with teal lights on one side and white lights on the other.  It was a charcoal metal color.  The car ahead of me and i actually stopped in the middle of the road and were actually dumb founded.  It never moved for five minutes.  I am a thirty one year old mother and an active member of the community and never thought I would have ever seen anything like this in my life.  If I wasn't so scared, I would have ! taken a picture. As it began to move again, completely silent, I spead to my house less than a mile down the road and sreamed for my husband to come outside to get me.  I ran hime up to the road to see what myslef and a fellow driver had just seen.  I would love to know if anyone saw this as well.;41.616;-74.1439
