a seemingly wedge shaped craft (isoceles shaped presumably) with bright white lights at the points and another in the center.;1999-06-11 22:40:00;15 minutes;a seemingly wedge shaped craft (isoceles shaped presumably) with bright white lights at the points and another in the center. i was driving home with my girlfiend when i saw two bright lights in the sky. at first i thought they were just planes comming into the local airport from out west. as we got out of the car to go inside, another just above the lower light appeared, forming the outline of the formation (isoceles in shape with longest point heading north), shortly another light appeared in the center of the other three. i recalled other sightings in the area over the years of these wedges so my girlfriendand i rushed inside to wake my mother and get a camera. when we got back the center light was gone and the wedge appeared to turn towards the east and us and back again. i snapped off about 7 or 8 pictures from various angles and magnifications. shortly after two points broke away, lowered in altiude and moved off moving parallel with each other to the south. one was close enough (1 or 1.5 miles) and 200-300 feet in altitude, where i saw two red lights set back from the main white one and a small blinking white one behind those. the object appeared to be moving at approx 250-300mph with no sound of even trail of sound that would indicate a farther distance. the third light which remained in place dimmed slightly and brightened again. i went inside to make a quick diagram and note the time. i also changed out of my work clothes and spoke to a friend about it on the phone. i went back out about 30 minutes later and the light was gone. later i noticed all the local radio stations which usually come in loud and clear were scrabled substantially.;41.616;-74.1439
