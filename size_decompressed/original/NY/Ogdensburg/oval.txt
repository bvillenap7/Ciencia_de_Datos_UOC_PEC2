Moved from west to east paralleling the St Lawrence River (but not over it ). I followed it until it was lost behind trees and houses. No noise was noted,  I waited for a minute in case it was higher than it appeared.  I was moving very fast compared to aircraft  I have seen int the area.  I was facing roughly SSW when I noticed it and it appeared south of me but very close to over my head.  The Elevation was approx 75-80deg, traveled in a straight line and I followed it for approx 90 degs.  The Object's size was approx the size of Â½ sized full moon.
