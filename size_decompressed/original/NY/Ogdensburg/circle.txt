Then just zipped off di We were out spotting deer,about a mile from home, all the sudden my husband shut off his spotting light and asked, did I see that?  He pointed out 3 spheres circling each other -at fast pace like they were playing about 3 ft. off the ground.  On his side of the car about 50 ft from center of the road in the field.  Then just spead off north west.  WE were about 3 miles from the St. Lawrence river.  We have asked many neighbors, family & friends and the only one that had seen something simalar was my brother _he'd seen around his farm (where I grew up) down the road (towards were the balls headed when we saw-same discription as us about the size of soft balls)  He said Dad (I knew he'd seen some wierd stuff over the years while in woods cutting trees,working fields and while in Navy, he passed away the same year we saw lights so didn't get to discuss with him)had told him about seeing same around the farm.  This has really bothered my husband and I.  Who can! one talk to about when see...wish had camera.  You my contact us if wish.   Thank you for letting me get this off my chest.  BELIEVER NOW FOR SURE! ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));44.6890000000001;-75.4811000000003
