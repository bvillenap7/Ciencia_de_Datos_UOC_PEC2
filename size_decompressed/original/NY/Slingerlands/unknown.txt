UFO.;2013-08-22 03:00:00;3 minutes;ufo The area I'd lived in at time was not close to many houses, the street was surrounded by woods and behind my house was a highway.   At 3 am I remember waking up for no reason and i couldn't fall back asleep.  My room was in the attic and i could open my window and look out and see nearly everything in the sky.   I did this, and you couldnt hear a single thing outside, it was dead quiet.  I noticed a bright light in the sky maybe 2 1/2 football fields away, not very high up, while i was smoking a cigarette out the window.   It began coming closer.  Moving like a helicopter could, stopping for brief seconds, til it was nearly over my house.   I honestly freaked out and hid under my covers.  It was the strangest night of my life.
