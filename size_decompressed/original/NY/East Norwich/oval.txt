High speed object with bright green light over Nassau County NY;2009-01-03 23:35:00;< 1 sec;High speed object with bright green light over Nassau County NY I was driving eastbound on Route 25A in Nassau County New York and observed an object proceeding at what appeared to be a high rate of speed, and which was oval with a crescent of metal/silver/white surrounding a single extremely bright green light. Its trajectory seemed to be from west to east and possibly proceeding downward slightly. There was no sound. It was in my vision (through a clear windshield) for probably less than 0.5 sec. The light extinguished suddenly and completely while it was high in the sky. It was a very clear night, very dark, and with a yellow crescent moon practically on the horizon. I was driving on a dark stretch of road with no street lights and no traffic lights. As I continued driving home, I searched for any further signs of activity, but found none. For the record, I do not drink or take drugs. This is my first and only sighting of a UFO;40.8485;-73.5258
