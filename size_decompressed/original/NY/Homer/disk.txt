I was coasting to a stop at the corner of Stanford Drive and Route 281, when I looked east northeast, and saw a very bright, flaming orange disk floating in the sky 250-2000 feet above RT. 11, or the hills to the east of RT. 11.   Motionless for a few seconds after I spotted it, it slowly descended vertically until it disappeared  behind some trees or homes.   I judged the object's size to be the diameter of a large house or a bit bigger.  It had  a perfect disk shape, like a cat food tin.     I heard no sounds or experienced any other sensations.  However, my car's windows were all closed.   I was very curious, and wanted to drive closer, but I was already late for work.   I turned up Rte 281 heading north, and tried to catch another glimpse, but did not see it.;42.6726;-76.1878
