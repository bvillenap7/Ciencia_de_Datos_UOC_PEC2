It was pretty clear out I was star gazing.  I'm pretty sure the first object I seen was a satellite.  Then about 20 minutes later from the opposite direction. Going counter clock wise I seen what looked like the same satellite. A huge burst of light came out of the side of it and then I realized it was rotating with the one light coming around every few seconds that's what it looked like, I could not see any shape to it but it looked like a small star floating across the sky until it started this rotating and shining of this huge light which I could see going outwards from the object like a flash light being turned on a foggy night.   I want to also make a comment, I believe something is happening and that there is going to be a major event soon.
