Was sitting outside my house, stargazing.  I live in a pretty rural area so the sky is really clear and easy to see on cloudless nights.  I heard what I thought was a helicopter flying pretty low and I didn't pay attention to it until it more into my line of vision.  I noticed there were three lights and I figured, for a second, it was three flying in formation, BUT I kept watching and the lights stayed completely equidistant the entire time.  I went to our back porch to get a better look and I saw the barest hint of a triangle silhouette.  I watched the lights disappear behind the hills, the lights stayed totally equidistant and did not change (not at all like the brigades of helicopters I've seen flying together, even at night).  One of them was red.;42.7504;-74.191
