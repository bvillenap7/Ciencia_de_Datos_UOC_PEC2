I was driving home, when I saw an oval, almost eye-shaped orange, glowing shape in the sky. It caught my eye, and I immediately found myself trying to find a logical explanation for it.  Unable to find one, I just kept looking, and it seemed suspended in the air.   The object was rather large, and I saw another small one off in the distance, but this one was far enough off to not have much of a shape.  It just looked like another star, but orange.   At this point, I started to pull over to attempt to get a picture, but before I even came to a complete stop, the larger of the two objects disappeared into the distance at a speed which seemed to be an extremely high rate.;43.1723000000001;-76.1031999999998
