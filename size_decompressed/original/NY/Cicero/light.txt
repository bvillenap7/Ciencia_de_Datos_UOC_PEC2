3 orange/red lights gliding across sky.;2015-12-24 20:45:00;5 minutes;3 orange/red lights gliding across sky. Saw 3 orange/red lights gliding through the sky, at an approximate equal distance from one another.  Heading south at first, then they changed course and traveled east.  They then disappeared.   Movements of lights did not appear to be similar to the movement of an airplane or helicopter.  No noise, either.;43.1723000000001;-76.1031999999998
SIGHTING #3:  Bright white pulse of light, quickly diminishing to star intensity, moving.;2016-09-21 20:30:00;15 minutes;Bright white pulse of light, quickly diminishing to star intensity, moving 21:30  To the NNW, there was a very bright white pulse of light, brighter than any star, for about one second.  As the pulse diminished, a white object could be seen, moving NNW, quickly diminishing to the intensity of a star, and then invisible. 21:45 To the North, another bright pulse of white light, but could not detect any movement. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite responsible and sober-minded.  PD));43.1723000000001;-76.1031999999998

Very fast moving light going across the sky.;2020-10-08 20:45:00;10 seconds;Very fast moving light going across the sky As i was getting out of the hot tub (outside) i was looking up in the sky when is seen a fairly bright light moving east to west at a rate of speed that is not a airplane or a satellite...as i followed and wondered what that was, on the same path there were 5 of the same shape/light following, almost looking like a string of pearls. Never seen something moving that fast.Almost every night out in the hot tub star gazing and or watching them (tracking via app) air planes, but never seen this before;43.1723000000001;-76.1031999999998
