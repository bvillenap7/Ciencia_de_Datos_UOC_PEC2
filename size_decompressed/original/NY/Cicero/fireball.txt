We were both standing on our back deck and it is 9:30 at night so it is dark and all of a sudden we looked across the road and there was a big ball of what seemed to be a ball of fire with a steady glow.  There was no sound and it just hovered over and was just drifting over us.  We tried calling our neighbor out and the instant she opened the door and looked up in the sky it just shot into the air poof gone!   Wow...I have two videos and some pics but cell phones stink when it's dark !  Wow.;43.1723000000001;-76.1031999999998
Glowing Orange/Red lights - Central NY;2012-07-21 21:30:00;5 minutes;Glowing Orange/Red lights - Central NY Approximately 930pm one of my sons went to a second floor window facing south and said he saw two lights.  Thinking they were stars or planes (the Syracuse airport and NY National Guard base is about 5 miles south) I went to the window and saw two large glowing orange/red orbs heading very slowly north.  After a minute or two they I noticed a very faint orb much higher than the other two.  The orbs then appeared to stop and rise slowly, fading out within the next couple of minutes. Altitude was hard to judge but a guess would be about 2000-3000 feet with the third much higher. The objects made no noise detectible from our location.  They could have been chinese lanterns or similar however the timing of fading out and differing altitudes and brightness when they we no longer visible didnt seem random. I really dont know what they were but they were observed by my wife, 2 children (10 & 8) and myself and I can saw were the strangest thing Ive seen in the sky.

5 orange orbs hovering around Cicero, NY.;2014-05-10 20:00:00;5 minutes;5 orange orbs hovering around Cicero, NY. I was on my way to work to pick up my check. As soon as I pulled out of my driveway and turned onto Backstretch Path I saw about 5 glowing bright orange orbs floating around past Lakeshore Road.   I pulled the car over because I was simply baffled by the sight. I then turned around, pulled back up into my driveway and proceeded to get my family and show them the orbs.   The orbs all moved in the same direction and they wavered a little up and down.  Sometimes one or two of them would move really fast and then suddenly slow down again.   a couple minutes after that they moved out of sight.;43.1723000000001;-76.1031999999998
