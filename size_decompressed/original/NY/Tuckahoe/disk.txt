RED/WHITE LIGHTS REVOLVING AROUND DISK SHAPE.  3 WITNESSES.;1976-11-01 18:00:00;30 minutes;RED/WHITE LIGHTS REVOLVING AROUND DISK SHAPE.  3 WITNESSES. 3 OF US WERE COMING HOME FROM BASKETBALL PRACTICE, ME AND 2 OTHER GUYS.  ONE GUY WAS NOT A CLOSE FRIEND, BUT SOMEWHAT OTHER GUY NOT A FRIEND AT ALL BUT THE TALLEST GUY IN SCHOOL WELL OVER 6 FT.   WE STOPPED 2 HOUSES UP THE STREET FROM WHERE I LIVED.  THE 3 OF US WERE LOCKED INTO A MIND GRIP, I GUESS YOU CAN CALL IT, WITH A SPACE SHIP LITERALLY LESS THAN 50 FEET AWAY HOVERING ABOVE A TREE.  I WOULD GUESS IT WAS ABOUT 50 FT WIDE.   AT THE TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS THERE FOR 5 MINUTES THAN LEFT, BUT YEARS LATER, I REALIZED THAT WHEN WE GOT THERE IT WAS LIGHT AND WHEN I LEFT IT WAS DARK.   I WAS FROZEN SOLID PANICKING INSIDE MY MIND THEY WERE COMMUNICATING WITH ME.  I THINK THEY WANTED ME TO DO SOMETHING BUT THE MORE THEY PROCEEDED TO COMMUNICATE, THE MORE SCARED I GOT.  THEY FINALLY GAVE UP AND WOOSHED AWAY.  I SAW THE RED WAKE AS IT SPED AWAY.  I RAN HOME, AND MY FRIENDS WERE TALKING TO THE POLICE EXPLAINING THE WHOLE STORY.;40.957;-73.8246
