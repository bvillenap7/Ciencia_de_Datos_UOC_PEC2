I was out on a star watch when I noticed an object appear out the corner of my eye about..not to high off the ground. To be brief about this as possible, I could not tell if the object had any shape but it had 2 red lights ( one of which faded on and off)1 green light and 1 white light. Now I was about to dismiss this as a plane except for 2 odd factors. I stared at the object through my 12x50 binocs, noticing it was going up and down while traveling. I thought it was just me shaking the binos till I saw it better with my eyes and noticed it was infact going up and down :-). Now I thought this would be weird for any object I've ever seen. The other factor was the NO SOUND that came from it. A brief second after I spotted it, I looked up and saw a jet flying HIGH up, over 30,000 that made a loud noise but this object I was staring at..made NO SOUND. So I thought it was odd, So I just followed it for a while till it almost dissappeared over a concrete wall but then it stopped for a moment, so I continued to stare at it, then it stareted to hover up a bit and travel some more ( What was odd about it..was it stopped when it was almost out of my view twice, as if it didn't want me to not miss it!) It eventually dissappeared over the horizon after making a few zig zag patterns and stopping a few more times.;44.4502;-75.6727
