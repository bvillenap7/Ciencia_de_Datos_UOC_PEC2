Then i saw a bright moving star (light) moving very fast to the right.. it stopped then made a very sharp turn straight up. No plane can make that sharp of a verticle turn. It continued going straight up then slowed down then sped off fast again to the left this time.;40.7606;-72.9844
4th of July sighting of 6 stange  pairs of moving red lights in sky;2009-07-04 23:00:00;20 min;4th of July sighting of 6 stange  pairs of moving red lights in sky They came in pairs of 2, in about 2-3 minute intervals and crossed the mile within 1-2 minutes. So for a solid minute we watched them pass. They were Orange/Red lights that were circular I believe?? More a blur or fuzzy light. At first we thought jets, but they were way to close together and moving at such a strange pace, almost dragging. They were also only light- there was no clear shape. Then...they just dissapereared into the sky. they were there one second then one by one they dissapeared. It was so strange and i was too scared to take a video. one girl got a picture, but no videos, we were all just too shocked. A few were screaming, scared, thought maybe commets. Anyway I just read some articles and saw video clips of others and that is EXACTLY what we saw. Strange and I wish I knew more!;40.7606;-72.9844

It did not look like anything we have eve seen so we pulled over and got out.  They looked like stars flying in formation.  They flew at a slow rate of speed and each disappeared as they passed.  The lights were up high, no sound.  The light were mostly a light orange color.   They were heading in an eastward direction flying over Bluepoint Ny, which is right next to Patchogue.   I'm wondering which it could have been either military or UFO's.   Please let me know if anyone else has reported our sighting to your hotline. Thank you,  ((name deleted));40.7606;-72.9844

To the right of it there was another light formation vertical lights just like the other one but it was moving. This one passed over me.  It was silent but I could notice some type of propeller.   When I lost visual contact I looked to see if the other one was still there and it remained stationary.  I went inside.  Kind of spooked!;40.7606;-72.9844
