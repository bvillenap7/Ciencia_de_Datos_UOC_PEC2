One red-lighted craft slowly rose in the air like a firework, but continued to rise to about 1,000 feet above the highest firework.  It hovered and moved in all directions and was able to stop on a dime. This craft was soon joined by a second identical craft.  The lights on both crafts turned green.  Each craft had multiple lights.  Eventually, after the fireworks performance ended (around 10:20 pm), the two craft slowly headed North until they couldn't be seen again. We could only see the lights of the craft.  They could have been drones.  If so, they were expensive (high tech) ones.;40.7606;-72.9844
