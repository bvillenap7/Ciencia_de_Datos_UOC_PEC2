Red Orb like lights, appearing and disappearing abruptly.;2015-07-04 22:00:00;20 minutes;Red Orb like lights, appearing and disappearing abruptly I live near a lake in North Patchogue so the area is often clear enough to see fireworks on July 4th.   My sister and I walked a few blocks, arriving there around 10pm.  As soon as we got there, we stood in front of the lake, facing north, and watched the fireworks until 10:10.  Around that time I pointed out a glowing red circle in the sky.  It wasn't any plane or aircraft I have seen before.   The red circle was still and not blinking like a plane or helicopter does.  It moved from the northeast were I spotted it, across the north and after looking at more fireworks, moments later it suddenly disappeared.   We saw 4 or 5 of these lights before leaving.  They all appeared and disappeared without notice.  There were some clouds that night but after watching these orbs disappear behind the clouds they never reappeared on the other side, but instead disappeared abruptly.  They were high up in the sky but were very bright and we did not hear any sounds coming from them.  Each orb appeared in the east/northeast direction and moved North/Northwest.  The most of these orbs I saw in the sky at one time were 2, one in the East and one North.  We left around 10:30, with these orbs still appearing in the sky as we were leaving.;40.7606;-72.9844
