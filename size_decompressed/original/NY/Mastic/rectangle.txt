Rectangular object floating above trees.;2008-02-26 01:00:00;15 min;Rectangular object floating above trees. It was around 1am & my husband was working.  I heard a squeaking noise outside and looked out the window.  There was a rectangular object hovering above the tallest tree in my neighbors house.  It was quite close & pretty much I was frozen in my tracks.   I initially thought it was a helicopter (medivac type that is rectangular).   I opened up the back door quickly to get a closer look.   However, it was NOT stirring up any wind – especially being so close, and it didn’t sound like a helicopter at all.  It made a squeaking sound pretty much like a squeaky wheel.  It was hovering completely stable unlike a helicopter remaining perfectly still.  I tried calling my husband on the cell (it is what I grabbed first), but the call failed multiple times.  I retreated to my bedroom where I peeked thru the blinds of a darkened room.  I had closed the blinds at one point & looked out again and it was gone.  I then saw & heard a “obvious” helicopter roaming around with a search light.  The sound very unlike the first object I had seen, and also a different shape (smaller oval helicopter).  My only regret is I didn’t grab my camera or camcorder.  I was too much in shock & too frightened to even make a move past the windows.;40.8091;-72.8564
