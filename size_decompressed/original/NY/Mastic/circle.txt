Bright circle object with dark spot in the middle very fast.;2012-01-31 18:25:00;Less then 5 seconds;Bright circle object with dark spot in the middle very fast. Both me and my friend saw this U.F.O. (Unidentified flying object not some round thing with martians in it) it was just after dark between 5:20- 5:30.  We both happened to glance at the sky at the rite moment.  It was traveling in the same direction I was so it passed over me(not directly over a few feet over my head but up in the air over me) and flew in a straight path until it wasn’t visible, which was about less than 5 seconds It was going very fast there wasn’t anything to get in my field of view so it flew until I couldn’t see it which again was less than 5 seconds.  It was a round in shape I’m not sure how maneuverable it was it flew in a straight path.  The whole circle was white but not colored it was a white like it was radiating light around the bottom until the middle of it which was just a dark spot.;40.8091;-72.8564
