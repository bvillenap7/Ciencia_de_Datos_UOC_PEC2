We both saw a bright white light traveling in the sky.  It was moving too slow to be a meteorite,  and way too fast to be a plane.    After traveling parallel to the horizon  it stopped mid flight for approximately 5 - 10 seconds.  It then suddenly accelerated very rapidly away from us, and to the left and seemed to be gaining altitude.   Within a few seconds it was gone.  The whole sighting took less than 15 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates a morning sighting.  We suspect that he means a sighting during evening hours, but we cannot be certain.  We will attempt to clarify the point.
