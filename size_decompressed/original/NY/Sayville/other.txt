The a;2010-09-26 04:30:00;20 seconds;Looking to the sky on a very clear night we saw a glowing object that was reasonably close maybe 1-2 miles in the sky east of us.  The aircraft was flying at about a quarter mile high in altitude and was moving at a slow pace southward.  The shape of this object was very odd, it seemed to have a very slow moving vertical helicopter blade in the back that was glowing, and a sphere shaped body in the front but was large.   We could not hear any noise from this object but it just hovered right along its path until it was out of our sight. we considered following it but it was too late in the night.;40.7434;-73.0761000000001
