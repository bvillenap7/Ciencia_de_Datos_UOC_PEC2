Im awake, watching TV as usual, because of course I can never sleep, and I have a very large picure window in my living room. I happen to see something that would resemble an airplane, except for the speed and the color of the lights. The lights were amberish and the speed that this object flew across the sky was faster than any airplane that I have seen. I often to see airplanes in the same area, but they are more distant and distinctly airplanes. This seemed almost close, and the speed of it was quite fast. It went into the western sky, towards what I would guess the Rome area. It was quite odd, enough to where I got up to see what it was and where it was heading to.;43.0697;-75.2819
