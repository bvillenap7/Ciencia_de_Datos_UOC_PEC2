Cyclicly-varying brightness white flashing point-light with 5-second rate and 30-second period moving slowly west-to-east at night.;2019-06-02 23:30:00;~4 minutes;Cyclicly-varying brightness white flashing point-light with 5-second rate and 30-second period moving slowly west-to-east at night. First spotted (through window) near Alcor-Mizar in Ursa major (very high in sky) as a single bright point flash of light significantly brighter than any nearby stars.  Flashes continued at about 5-second intervals each with longer duration but diminished brightness until after 3 flashes duration was about 1 second and substantially dimmer than original flash.  The flashes then increased in brightness and shortened in duration until approximately identical to first flash.   Cycle was seen to repeat at least 4 times until too near zenith to keep in sight through window. Object appeared to move-drift almost due-eastward at approximately 10 degrees per minute - MUCH slower than ISS or Iridium satellites that I enjoyed observing until satellites were recently de-orbited.  MUCH slower than any commercial high-altitude aircraft.   No dimming or obscuration of neighboring stars observed.   Sky-conditions unusually clear, dark and cloud free.;43.1404;-77.2871
