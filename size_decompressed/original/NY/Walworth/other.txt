Possible Iridium satellite flash and then a high speed object approaches and makes turns then disappears.;2013-03-05 20:55:00;<30 seconds;Possible Irridium satellite flash and then a high speed object approaches and makes turns then disappears On the evening of March 5 around 8:55 PM Eastern I was admiring the clear night sky from my outdoor hottub near Rochester NY.   In the sky nearly overhead and slightly west of the Big Dipper I glanced the dimming of what appeared to be a star about the brightness of Jupiter.  I thought it may be an Iridium satellite flash that I have seen before so I kept looking at the area to see if I could find which way the satellite was heading. Within about 10 seconds of the flash I saw a fast moving object approaching from the south-southwest glowing a dull reddish color â€“ barely visible.  It was travelling much faster than a satellite and perhaps half the speed of what I originally thought was a meteor. When the object got into the general vicinity of the original flash, it slowed and a made U-turn and then another before it disappeared, all within the span of several seconds.  I did not see any further trace of the satellite or the mysterious object.;43.1404;-77.2871
