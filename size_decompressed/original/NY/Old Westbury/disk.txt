It had a band of flashing lights through the center of it and it was traveling faster than a blimp would. It was saucer-like shaped, did not change shapes, and had a bright, illuminating glow of white as its color. As stated before, I was at my home in my room when I witnessed an unidentified object gliding across the sky in front of my house.  It was large in shape (saucer-like), white in color, had a band of flashing lights through the center, and traveled faster then a blimp would.  The sighting lasted about 3-4 minutes.  Three people witnessed it. There was only one aircraft traveling across the sky.  The night sky was very calm that night, with no obstructions of what we had seen. I was able to take a picture of the object as it felw by.  The aircraft did not make any loud sounds. This occurance happened between 12:30 and 12:40 am on October 15, 1999.;40.7894;-73.5855

The craft was really low, a little above the height of a tall tree.  The space ship was parallel to us while we were driving, but eventually we got away from it and it was no longer in our field of vision.;40.7894;-73.5855
