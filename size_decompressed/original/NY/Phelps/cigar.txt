two large cigar shapped odjects chased off by police helicopter;2008-04-29 14:30:00;20-30 sec;two large cigar shapped odjects chased off by police helicopter I was on the bus at 2:30pm and I looked out the window then the radio went out and saw two dull black cigar shaped objects. They were about 800ft away and 10 degrees hovering stationary in the sky above a farm field. They appeared to be the size of two school buses long and two high.There was no sound and were hovering stationary apart 200ft from each other  on a windy day.After ten to fifteen seconds of observation a helicopter[New   York State Police] flew over the bus about one hundred feet off the ground heading for the craft.The helicopter got about six hundred feet from the objects,then both of them  vanished in a blink of an eye.Then the chopper did a few circles and the radio came back on.I am an aircraft enthusiast and never have seen aircraft look or act like this.;42.9579;-77.0455
