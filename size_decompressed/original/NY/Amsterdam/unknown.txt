The occupant I was with recorded a video of the object, but the clarity of it is poor, only showing a white object.  However, it was glowing bright red, but would dim slowly to orange, then return back to red.  It did this repeatedly throughout the experience.  Its movement was quite slow, and there was a lack of sound accompanied by the object.  It was traveling in an Easterly direction.  Elevation was roughly 1,000 to 1,500 feet in the air.  I lost visual when the lights dimmed completely out roughly 3 to 4 miles to our West.  The skies were clear with stars visible.;42.9607644927536;-74.1669557971018

She had called me over and I had saw what didn't look like a star nor doesn't sound/look like any air craft or tot craft I have seen.  It was hovering in one area.   No noise coming from it.  It flashed yellow, red, green, and a possible orange like color of lights.  The green was mainly shown on the sides from my point of view.  Where I was in my location, the width was about 1cm and the height was about half a centimeter.   It started to fly away north of my direction.  As it did, a quiet humming sound came directly from it.   I don't know what I have saw.  But it is truly my first time witnessing and unknown flying object, a UFO. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I am sorry, I mean January 28, 2016.  Again, sorry for the mix up Sent from my iPhone ((END ADDENDUM));42.9607644927536;-74.1669557971018
