I look up to see a ball of light which at first glance looked like a star.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-07 05:50:00;5 minutes;Me and a friend woke up to go get breakfast and were walking down to the store.  I look up to see a ball of light which at first glance looked like a star, but I noticed that it was moving, along with another dimmer ball of light adjacent to the brighter one.  One was an even dimmer, barely noticeable if you weren't looking at it.  It was either low flying or very large in size, it was too dark out to really tell.  The triangular shape object disappeared shortly after we spotted it.  It moved at a slow rate, almost like a drifting.;42.2767;-73.8175
