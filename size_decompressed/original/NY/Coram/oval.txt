Took 2 videos of these oval red lights patrolling from West to East over fireworks.  One red oval stayed hovered above the moon for nearly an hour.  The red ovals when I would film and talk about it, one slowed down over me than moved lightening fast to the east.  There were also about 5 fast moving white UFO's that were NOT planes or drones.  My friend works as a flight control tower at Islip Airport in NY and knows about them.  My camera battery went dead after it zoomed away and it was fully charged.;40.8879;-73.0087
