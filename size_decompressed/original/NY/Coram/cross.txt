It was almost pitch black with just a slight ray of light coming over the horizon as the sun was setting.  I was coming home from work when out of the corner of my eye I saw something that looked like it was flying like a plane but it was moving too slow to be a plane and too fast to be a drone.  However, I noticed there were no green or red lights underneath the ufo like how a plane or helicopter would of had them.  Considering it was almost pitch black it would be strange to not have the lights on at 9:05 pm.  I also noticed there were two white lights on each side of the vehicle that didn’t blink.  Another thing I noticed was that the vehicle was completely silent and made absolutely zero noise in the night sky.  The lights were too close together to be a plane and too far apart to be a drone.  Let’s just say if it was a drone it would’ve been a massive 20 foot wide drone which I don’t think anybody in my area owns.  I couldn’t make out too much of the sh! ape but the two bright white lights on each side makes me think it had wings.  The ufo flew above the trees almost too close to them to be a plane and too high to be a drone.  Where it was flying wouldn't have made sense for either purpose.  It flew in a straight line for 20 seconds before it was out of my field of view.  Only one flying object was observed.;40.8879;-73.0087
