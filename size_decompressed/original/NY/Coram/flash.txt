It would reappear in a different area and then reappear half way across the sky from its original position.  Then we noticed a few more flashing lights moving around the original one, all doing the same thing.  Flashing, disappearing and reappearing.   We have seen similar things twice before during this past July and August but I can't give accurate dates or time. That's why I wanted to report this sighting while its fresh in my memory.  After a few minutes the lights went south east and past our line of view behind the trees.  These were not known helicopters, airplanes, Chinese lanterns, laser lights or remote control toys.  The lights were high up, they looked like stars that change from white to pale blue. We had clear skies when we saw the lights, so I don't believe they were objects alter! ed by clouds or atmospheric gases etc.   One more thing, we didn't hear anything either.
