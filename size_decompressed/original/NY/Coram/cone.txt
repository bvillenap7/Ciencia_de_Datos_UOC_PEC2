Coram Red glowing/flickering....something...what was it?;2013-07-13 21:00:00;~5 minutes;Coram Red glowing/flickering....something...what was it? I am sure there is a explanation that can be confirmed 100%.  I went out at 9:00 last night and was blown away by this ..ok,  I don't believe it was from outer space, just, the brightest red cone shape with an oval yellow/orange base to it.  It was moving slow enough that I wished I had run in and gotten my camera but was too afraid it would be gone… I watched this glowing/flickering red that was a gorgeous color and it seemed to move around as it was going through the sky.  I ran to the front of the house to continue watching it until it was too far away to make it out anymore.  No sound to it at all… I literally froze in awe the first minute… I would love for someone to tell me the rational explanation as to what this was.;40.8879;-73.0087
