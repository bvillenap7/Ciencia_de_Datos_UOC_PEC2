If anything the object was pyramidal in shape and towering into the sky.   It was just on the other side of the overpass, to the right of the highway and starting to cross over, I drove under the overpass and slowed my car and pulled to the side of the road, just underneath the object.   It was 5-10 feet above my head and my sunroof was wide open,  If I stood up It felt like I could touch it.  I turned off my car and sat there in amazement. First I noticed the almost lack of sound, but that’s not it, there was like a hum (not my engine fan) or almost a vibration to it, a heavy feel. It was moving at a slow pace and spanned the width of the highway which was 6 lanes with median and was triangular from the bottom, so it was like a pyramid. The lights on it were not bright, meaning there were no spotlights on, or headlights, more like little lights – LED like, it was definitely metal and had detailing beyond my vocabulary to describe, but I will try flat metallic-almost grey-black- it seem almost circuit like with lights, and grooves  at least at the  outer perimeter–edging the pyramid with sharp corners.  But it wasn’t deep grooved almost flat like.  The center seemed more flat and less lit. (ok to give the best reference from todays’ sci fi- like a far away view of a borg cube)   But my best view was what was above my head. It passed over the highway and some of the trees and I couldn’t see it anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.8879;-73.0087
