Eight pulsating balls of light witnessed.;2015-07-11 20:30:00;30 minutes;Eight pulsating balls of light witnessed Eight silent pulsating orbs of a fire or amber color were witnessed by my friend & I. This sighting took place on Saturday July 11th, which was the following Saturday after the 4th of July.  People in the neighborhood were still setting off the last of their fireworks.  The reason I mention this is because the lights seemed to be attracted to them, as they all headed in that direction one after the other.  The first of the eight orbs even came to a complete stop for about five seconds as I was recording it from my phone.  The flashlight on my phone was on & my friend said he thought that it could see me.   At that point I started to shake my phone back and forth to signal to it.  After the five seconds it resumed its direction towards the fireworks only a few blocks away.  All of these objects moved like they were on a track, the were floating steadily above the neighborhood.
