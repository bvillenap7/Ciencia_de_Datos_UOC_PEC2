We went outside on a decently clear night.  There may have been a light overcast, but we saw three red and orange spheres moving quickly through the sky.  Comparing them to the average speed of a plane, they were moving at least five times as quick.   They then went behind the tree line, and when they emerged again, they seemed to become one larger red and orange sphere.  The spheres moved north very quickly.  After that, and within 10 to 15 seconds, they were no longer in range of sight.   Note that the average plane in the same area would be in range to be seen for at least 15 minutes for a passenger jumbo jet, and 3 to 4 minutes for f-16's that fly overhead every once and a while.;40.8879;-73.0087
