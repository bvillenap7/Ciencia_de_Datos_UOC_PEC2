I spotted a bright light outside my living room window, that looked like a very bright star, more like a blinking star. Its coloring was a gleamering blue green white . I watched for about 10 min. went back again to the window for another 5 to 10 minutes, there was no movement, it just seemed very bright, and unusually bright. Their were other stars in the noght sky, very vivid, this just didn't seem like a star. I started almonst feeling very uncomfortable, almost eiry. Again I went to the window and it was gone. Not a glimmer. Just sky, the stars were still visible, but this star or seemingly star disapeared. The object was located based on my orientation on long island, it would be west. Have their been any other recent sittings in this area. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a star or planet.  Witness does not say what direction he was looking.  PD));40.8675008474576;-73.4093737288138

Hoovering over Main street Huntington, NY.  Continued to go over Finely Middle school hoovered over it for about 5 minutes then went up into the clouds and disappeared.   It was moving not like a plane or a helicopter.  It was moving in different directions first low until it continued to make its way up slowly into the clouds really far but the light was still visible.   I took a video when I was able to stop my car, but the craft was too far and my phone camera quality is not good.;40.8675008474576;-73.4093737288138
