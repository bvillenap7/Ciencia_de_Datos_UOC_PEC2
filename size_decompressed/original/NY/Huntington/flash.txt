Flashing light, not an aircraft or shooting star. Rapid directional change.;2011-06-07 21:29:00;4 seconds;Flashing light, not an aircraft or shooting star. Rapid directional change. I was taking photographs of the stars, long exposures, at night.  I saw what I thought was a shooting star in my peripherals, and just like a shooting star, it came and went in about a second.   Then, I saw it flash again, and again, in a straight line.  I thought it was a plane, the average light flashing.  However, it was moving at an amazing speed.  I noticed it didn't have red/green lights. Just one white light.  When it flashed again, it had changed course by about 30 degrees in a span of time nothing of my knowledge could have done.  It changed course in between flashes.   Then, it stopped flashing and disappeared.   It was my first sighting I'm sure of.
