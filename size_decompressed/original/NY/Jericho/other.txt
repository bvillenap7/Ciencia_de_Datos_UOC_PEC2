Gosh, you freek'n idiots. for everyone that thought this was a U.F.O. Duuuuugh... It was the space station you idiots. Heading East well passing planes in speed. I was lucky to see it on my telescope.-Awesome. It crossed the Entire U.S. and did not blink. If you say that you saw its shape you're lying unless you have 20/20 vision. If you thought it was a shooting star, keep wishing. Nothing else was in vision aside from stars and the moon so you cannot say that this is not was you saw, like I know you will.  -------Yes YOU!!

This came from the south and was at first a gold light it had flashing lights, not constant, but flashing faster than an airplanes and had no pattern. Also, they didn't make much noise. At first I thought they were choppers, but they were too silent for choppers. They seemed to be in a chopper shape though or airplane shape. The only other possibility is a government new-aircraft. I saw what was clearly a gvt plane fly after one of the things, but it was dark and I'm unsure of all of this. I saw an at least regular airplane right after so I knew it wasn't one.
