CHANGING COLOR CIRCULAR UFO - Dutchess County  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus is in the western sky, currently.  PD));2020-04-20 09:16:00;Hour;CHANGING COLOR CIRCULAR UFO - Dutchess County Unlike Venus who shines the brightest in our Eastern sky, tonight my wife and I witnessed, photographed and videoed a circular object in the western sky, it was changing colors rapidly and quiet beautiful. I thought the first 20mins of observing/shooting that it wasnâ€™t moving but then after going inside then back out an hour later I observed it moved East but maintained same height in sky.  Also side note, 2 planes traveling in the direction of the object flew quite low.;41.5404;-73.8979
