Round burning object moving across Fishkill 8/2/14.;2014-08-02 21:45:00;1 minute;Round burning object moving across Fishkill, 8/2/14, I was heading north on route 9, and I had stopped at the light on route 9 and route 52.   I watched a moving round burning object moving slowly over Fishkill heading in a northern direction.  I saw it outside my drivers window.   This lasted about 1 minute and then just disappeared.  It definitely wasn't a plane or helicopter, because it was too low for a plane and didn't move like a helicopter.   I also listened for any sounds of a plane or helicopter and I didn't hear neither.  I took a picture and video but it didn't come out too well on my camera phone.;41.5404;-73.8979
