Orange glowing object stationary in sky over Beacon, Newburgh, NY.;2014-10-12 19:00:00;3 minutes;Orange glowing object stationary in sky over Beacon, Newburgh, NY. Spotted a reddish orange light Due West over Newburgh NY area as I was driving down my street.  Somewhat stationary.  Glowed with slight pulse.   When I jumped out of my truck as I parked in my driveway I had to run down the street to see between the trees.  It was quite high up.  I had seen it from maybe 2 plus minutes then the red glow faded from a round shape, to a triangle shape, with 3 sections like looking at an airplane prop.  To a dull orange then went out.  If I had to draw a comparison the light looked like a flare, a highway flare glow.  Maybe it was a balloon with a flare attached, of a parachute flare but I never seen one this high in the sky as I am familiar with flares.  Witnessed by my friend in the truck.  I know aircraft, I know meteors, this was something odd.  No time to take a photo. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date.
