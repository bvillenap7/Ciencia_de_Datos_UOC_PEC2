Unidentifiable object flying across the ski;2015-05-22 23:00:00;1 minute;Unidentifiable object flying across the sky. My husband and I walked out of the house and saw an illuminated round object flying across the ski.  It was round and orangey red glow.   We watched it fly or glide across the ski till we couldn't see it anymore.  I was frightened and wanted to leave quick.  Wondering what we saw but I could say a ufo because I'm not sure what it was.  Don't want to see that again!!!!!!!!;40.8785;-72.9538
