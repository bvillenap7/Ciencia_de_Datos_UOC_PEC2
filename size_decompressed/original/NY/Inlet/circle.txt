Wednesday August 10, 2011 9:50 PM I witnessed in the east sky approximately 35 to 40 degrees upward, an object which I cannot identify.  It had one Red Circle in the center and was surrounded by smaller circles.  (Just like the numbers are positioned on a clock).  I think there may have been 10 smaller circles.  The center circle was about 5 times bigger than the smaller ones around it.  It was moving slowly eastward very steady.  (I captured it on video but it would not stay focused and I was moving the camera which makes the item look like it was moving all over but it was not).  There are many split second spots in the video which shows it pretty clearly at the size I saw it.  I stopped videoing after my friend told me he thought it was an emergency flare, but the item did not distort or grow in size at all.  It stayed perfectly concentric and was moving slowly eastward.    I watched for approximately 2 minutes more until it disappeared into the horizon behind the clouds just like the Sun does.  I am trying to believe there is an explanation of what it could be.;43.7509;-74.7818
