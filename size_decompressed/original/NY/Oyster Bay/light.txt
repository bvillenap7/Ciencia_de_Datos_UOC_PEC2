Looking at the sky over the bay Teddy Roosevelt Park, there was a light very very high up in the atmosphere, roughly the size of a star, but much brighter. It traveled across the sky at an incredible speed, perhaps 15 minutes from one horizon nearly 75% to the other.  It moved with no sound or trail.  It appeared to almost wobble as it moved across the sky.  As it reached about 75% across the sky (relative to our perspective) it slowly vanished.  The light just dimmed until it was gone.  About 5 minutes later we saw another light moving in the same direction.  Both lights were coming roughly from the North West moving towards to the South East. This location where this occurred is about 20 miles from Laguardia Airport, and so as the lights moved across the sky, there were aircraft present also in the sky. It was easy to contrast the speeds, apparent heights, and light from the aircrafts as significantly different from the 2 lights observed .  Leaving the park, I believe I also saw something bright streak across the sky much brighter than a shooting star. This event was so quick that it was difficult to see, as by the time I turned my attention to it, it was gone. The lights, on the other hand, moved across the sky for about 15 minutes each so I was able to very clearly see and remember them.;40.8638;-73.5306
