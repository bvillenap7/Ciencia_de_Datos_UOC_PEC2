Larg triangle seen in the sky early in the morning.;2008-05-06 06:30:00;30 seconds;Larg triangle seen in the sky early in the morning. At around 6:30 A.M. i woke up early with my dog to take him out.  I got into the yard and my dog started going to the bathroom.  I saw some thing high in the sky. It was hard to see how high it was but it was about level with the clouds.  It looked triangular with very bright lights at each point.  It was much larger than a plane or helicopter.  There was no sound apearing to be coming from the object.It stayed in the sky for about 30 seconds before quikly turning into a haze and disapering into the west.;42.4867;-76.2881
