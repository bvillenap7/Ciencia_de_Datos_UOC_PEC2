My friend and I were at a bonfire at their house and she told me to look up and I did.  My friend asked me if I saw what she did.  I asked my friend if it was like a flash/circular thing in the sky. My Friend said yes.  We sat there watching the figure and finally there was 2 then 3, 4, 5 and then 5th one followed the fourth and they circled and came closer.  We got scared and ran into the house.  My friend's sister did not believe us until we got her to come outside to see for herself... she was scared.   She called her father and he had said not to worry.  We went back in.  My friend and I went back outside and sat there for a while watching the objects in the sky.  This time... about 5 again lined up in a line and darted forward.  We didn't want to stay out any longer so we went and sat on her porch... finally we got tired and just went inside.;42.1553;-79.0959
