Adult female witnesses 8 bizarre objects in the night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  See other reports from siblings of witness.  PD));2011-07-13 21:40:00;20 minutes;7/14/2011 At the intersection of Route 227 and Route 79 from Watkins Glen to Ithaca, NY, I saw a large stationary glowing yellow-white object in the sky, approximately 3 telephone poles high.   I stopped my car to get a better look, it was completely motionless for over a minute, then started to move to the right, soundlessly and smoothly.   I got in my car and followed it as I called members of my family to join me.  The object flickered as it moved, the faster it moved, the more rapidly it flickered, yellow, white and gold.   It ascended very quickly until it looked like a moving star, and I saw it join up with three others just like it, then several more appeared.   Another orb appeared on the horizon line in front of me and seemed to be headed right for me, but it also ascended and joined the others far ahead of me, very high in the sky,  I counted 8 all together.  They were all yellowish white, occasionally one of them would throw off what looked like and orange flare.!  They circled each other fairly slowly and asymmetrically.   At that point I got in my car and continued to try to follow them as I stayed in communication with my family and they reported seeing the same thing.   When we finally met up they were gone.   This took about 20 minutes from my sighting of the orb to the multiple orbs disappearing. ((NUFORC Note:    PD));42.3771;-76.9031
