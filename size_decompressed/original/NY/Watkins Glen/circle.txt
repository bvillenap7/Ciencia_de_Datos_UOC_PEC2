I told my husband it wasnt a star at all.It had green, red, blue, and yellow, white lights on it. I wasnt sure what it was at first, I asked my husband to get his banoculars out of the truck, and then we could see it even better,I ran in the house to get my children thinking we would never have the chance to experiance it again. The lights were realy bright at first, then it disapeared for about 20 seconds, then it came back again it was there for about 45 minutes until we got cold and went inside.;42.3771;-76.9031
Orange defined circle with interior slow burn flame passes slowly E to W following Glen Creek above tree canopy Watkins Glen NYS.;2014-08-23 21:30:00;1 minutes;Orange defined circle with interior slow burn flame passes slowly E to W following Glen Creek above tree canopy Watkins Glen, NY. Looking up through trees of campsite, (Tuscarora Village N. side) Watkins Glen State Park, husband and wife observed orange red circle moving silently slowly in west direction up Glen Creek (East to West).   The object was orange in center and had a red fire like ring on the peripheral circle, which had fire like licks or prongs emanating into the center orange portion, similar to looking straight up into the base of a rocket outlet, but flame going inwards to center and flames were slowly intermittent like a dying ember not a fast burn.  The object moved slowly west (visible intermittently through the tree canopy) and did not appear to be relatively high, I.E. lower than commercial jet aircraft and about as high as local prop aircraft).  The shape was definite perfect circle not rough like mold burn. Lost track through tree canopy.
