Similar to descriptions before...  8 amber colored lights coming one by one after each other from one direction and once they all disappeared there was one flashing light in the area were they disappeared.   It could not be a plane because there was a plane in the opposite direction and it was moving much faster then the objects in the sky!!!!;40.7282;-73.1805
