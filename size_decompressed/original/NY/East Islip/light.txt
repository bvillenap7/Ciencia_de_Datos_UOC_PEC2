Incredibly fast moving bright light in an oscilloscope-like path;2004-12-17 00:30:00;5 seconds;Incredibly fast moving bright light in an oscilloscope-like path I was merging onto Sunrise Hwy going eastbound when I looked up in the sky and immediately a bright white/bluish light that was moving extremely fast caught my eye.  I alerted my girlfriend and was able to get her to look quick before it went away she was able to catch it as it went fast across the sky and dissapeared.  It wasn't moving straight across the sky but it went up and down 3 or 4 times in an oscilloscope-like path before taking off in a straight line.  The speed was incredible. The object did not slow down as it changed from downward to upward motion. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD));40.7282;-73.1805
4  Orange lights in formation of rectangle in sky/ no sound;2013-09-22 23:45:00;20-25  seconds;4  Orange lights in formation of rectangle in sky/ no sound While stopped  facing south on Connetquot Ave in East Islip,  both people in the car saw 4 Orange lights in the sky moving from  Southwest  to East/ Northeast.  The 4 lights were in the formation of a small rectangle moving together at the same speed.  they dimmed out for 2 seconds then returned at the same time almost as if paying through a cloud.  It was late at night but the recently full moon was lighting up the sky pretty well,  and it's a fairly clear night as  well.  I've never seen anything like this in my life.  We DO  have an airport local,  however this made no sound (all planes over here fly low enough to hear loudly),  plus these lights were TOO  low to be any  planes.  Very interesting!;40.7282;-73.1805
