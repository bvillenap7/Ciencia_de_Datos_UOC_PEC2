I saw 5 red lights flying in a v-formation with two additional lights following behind.  They were flying west to east.  The lights were bright red.  There was a single light on each.   The lights were not blinking they were steady bright red.   There was no sound that I could hear.  I only saw them as they flew over. I am a Certified Financial Planner and I was working in my office, on my computer when I saw them.  I have a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Minnesota.;43.2167;-77.5583000000002

They all exhibited the same characteristics:  Flashing, multi-color lights and at a great distance and altitude.   They were so high they appeared to be stationary until we noticed that they were moving to the west.  We witnessed through binoculars which showed the lights changing.   Initially, I chalked it up to low orbit satellites reflecting the sun but discovered a video on youtube shot in San Francisco the same evening showing one of the exact same objects we viewed - link here https://youtu.be/DVNhpxKjULg;43.2167;-77.5583000000002
