Cylinder Aerodynamic Object with 6 Glowing White Lights Seen Over Irondequoit, NY!;2010-08-29 16:00:00;40 Seconds;Cylinder Aerodynamic Object with 6 Glowing White Lights Seen Over Irondequoit, NY! UFO Sighting  Sunday August 29th 2010  Irondequoit, New York  U.S.A. Sometime between 3:32 - 4:00PM  Eastern Standard Time  Duration: 40 Seconds  Angle Measurement As Distance Traveled in the Horizon from right index finger to left index finger: 3 FT 8 Inches Or:  44 Inches. Sun Size Measurement:  2    As 2 Sun’s next to one another  Color:  Brown... As Brown as a Brown M&M !  Shape:  Cylinder, with a sharp pencil point for a nose, 2 thin arced cylindrical / flat bladed wings, with a tail end shaped like a vertical rectangle with three spaced out stacked rows glowing with two sets of bright white lights powering it.   Like so:              ** ** ** * = the lights! 6 in total white glowing orbital lights!  The wings reminded me of wings seen on a wind powered one seater maned glider plane but not even remotely exact. The ONLY Man Made Plane that came remotely close, but no where as sophisticated as this object is the USAF / NASA  X-15 !  The Object Made ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND !  The WHY Not A UFO Answers:  1.  A North American  X-15 Would Have Made Noise!  2.  No Glider planes are able to fly around this area. Glider planes can’t go extremely high and need to be near a landing strip to land safely. 3.  A remote controlled toy aircraft would have lost frequency at the altitude the craft was seen at. 4.  A Bird would have been flapping it’s wings even when catching Big Air. A few bursts of flapping now and then when doing so! 5.  Only Myself & Two Other Family Members saw the object. The Two Significant Others Want NO Involvement & Plan To Remain Silent ! Thank you for Understanding. The Only Thing they will comment on is: “We both saw something and don’t believe it was anything important.”  Report in Detail  I was in the pool floating on a raft. My sister is also on a raft. My father is on the deck reading a book. Their is not a cloud in the sky except for some puffy ones to the west. Sometime between 3:32 PM and 4:00 PM Eastern time I’m laying on the raft facing the SouthEastern Sky. Out of thin air this brown object appears. I’m not frightened but puzzled. The object approaching from the SouthEast after clearing the tree line by my family’s pool dose a very smooth and graceful pitch & yaw towards the east and louses some altitude. As it cruses eastward for a bit it all of a sudden dose the unthinkable! It abruptly moves in a straight horizontal line in a flash northward, and I am now dead on, squared, straight forward, looking at the back end of this sucker. It is massive, and is now Four houses ahead in the sky over the backyards of where I am in the pool. As I look over the fence that is parallel with the hight of the pool the object is heading Eastward. It seams to ! be powered by 6 white lights in groups of 2, in 3 neatly stacked rows inside a vertical rectangle. The object makes no noise the entire time over the course of the viewing. While the craft is heading eastward it now decides to yaw left towards the NorthEast in a diagonal line pattern. As the craft travels NorthEast the back end lights are now separating off the back end of the craft and are rapidly creating a pulsing light dance around the craft, like electrons dancing around an atom. The balls of white lights are now pulsating rapidly to the point where they are looking like they are giving off static electric shocks and light bolts. While doing this the craft so elegantly yet very swiftly fades away into oblivion. The duration of time felt like an eternity to me, but sadly I later estimated the event to ruffly 40 seconds a minute was way to long. This is my testimony to what I had encountered. It is up to you my Friends to make of it what you want. As for the other witne! sses to the event, they ether saw bits and pieces due to obstr! uction o f view from the trees, or they hardly caught the last few seconds of the event. I hope you the enthusiasts have enjoyed reading my first and hopefully the last encounter that I will ever endure.;43.2167;-77.5583000000002
