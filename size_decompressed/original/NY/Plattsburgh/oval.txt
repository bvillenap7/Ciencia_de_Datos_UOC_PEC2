Translucent white/gray oval hovering over Lake Champlain.;2015-10-24 18:30:00;2 minutes;Translucent white/gray oval hovering over Lake Champlain While driving along Route 9 South an oval type object was seen hovering over the water of Lake Champlain about 1/4 of a mile off Wilcox Dock.  The object was a translucent white/grey in color and had a series of lights on the top of it.  The lights were Red and orange in color.  The object hovered over the water at about six feet above the lake.  As I drove to get a closer look it simply took off into the sky at a significant speed.  It did not make a sound.;44.6914156424579;-73.4647562383621
