Mysterous object sighted in sky.;2001-08-10 05:00:00;90 seconds;Mysterous object sighted in sky. I am a 61 year old retired teacher, and never experienced any unusual sightings or events before.  I do not know if what I saw was a UFO, but it diplayed unusual abilities.  I woke up shortly before 5AM EDT, to use the restroom, I had been sleeping since 11PM, there were electrical storms in the area at that time, but none directly overhead.  I was looking out the bathroom window at the cloud to cloud lightning coming from the west, the window faced west.  I noticed to the northwest what I first thought was a star or planet, but it kept moving in a west to east direction, and as it got closer I believed it to be an aircraft trying to out-run the approaching storm.  I saw what I believe to be wing red and green lights on the object which I took as wing markers.  All of a sudden the object turned south and dove very rapidly toward the earth, I thought that it was going to crash.  It stopped its rapid dive , turned to the north and rapidly climbed into the approaching storm cloud and disappeared.;44.6914156424579;-73.4647562383621
