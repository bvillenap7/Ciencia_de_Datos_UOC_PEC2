It moved from the northwestern to the southeastern sky from where we were. It was at an extreamly high altitude and was moving at a speed covering about 30 miles of sky in 1 min. My freind is a pilot and this is how we came to the conclusion that this was not a man mad craft( the we have ever heard of). It also did not have a tale ruling out a shouting star. Nor did it have any flashing lights. It was a constant white glow. This was followed shortly by the apperance of 2 fighter jets that usualy dont fly paterns this time of nite. ((NUFORC Note:  We first suspected that the sighting might have been caused by the International Space Station, but it was not in the vicinity of New York at the time indicated.  Several minor satellites might have been visible, but at least 13 minutes earlier than the time indicated above.  The sighting probably was not caused by a satellite overflight.  Sourc elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));44.6914156424579;-73.4647562383621
