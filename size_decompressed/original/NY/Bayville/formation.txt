3 orbs in a tight triangle formation.  ((anonymous report));2018-01-19 18:50:00;5 seconds;3 orbs in a tight triangle formation Saw 3 dark orange-brown orbs in a very tight triangle formation, although at one point one of the orbs leap-frogged another one.  Initially, I thought it was lazer beams pointed at the sky, however their were no clouds, thus nowhere for the beams to shine on.  It hovered above my head for a second and then flew across the sky at such incredible speeds that it vanished beyond the horizon in a matter of seconds.
