Red fireball resembling distresss flare steadily moving 500ft. above the ground.;2014-08-17 20:00:00;2 minutes;Red fireball resembling distresss flare steadily moving 500ft. above the ground Three of us all witnessed what appeared to be a meteor distress Flare at first however it did not rise or fall but remained at the same approximate altitude of 500ft. above the deck. It was bright red, noiseless, and moved over our heads and across the night sky.  It very much resembled a flare except the center seemed to emit a yellowish glow like a flashlight would.   One of the observers said he thought it was a small UAV and had seen one at an event the weekend before where they hover around shooting video.  It is possible this was one and the lights were LED, however this was very bright, made no noise, did not flash, change altitude or course.   We live and I work on a nearby Military Air Field and am very used to seeing/hearing aircraft flying VFR and IRF over our house to it and this certainly was not one.;43.8022;-76.0485
