2 unidentifiable flying objects passsed over our home in Kerhonkson , NY;2009-11-16 20:00:00;15 min;2 unidentifiable flying objects passsed over our home in Kerhonkson , NY Looked like a bright golden star off in the distance, seemed to hover and then rise straight up.  The star then seemed to fly in a slight zig/zag pattern.  As it got closer there appeared small rectangular shapes at the bottom of the object- these rectangles had a blue/grey hue to them, and there were two small flashing lights- a white one at the top and a red one at the bottom.  It flew off and disappeared.  About 15 min later another golden star was spotted (North over Kerhonkson and heading south).  This one flew in the same zig zag pattern, as it passed by we snapped some photos.  Did not see any rectangles on this one.
