Bright light illuminates daytime sky over Kerhonkson, NY at funeral for elderly witness to at least 2 UFOs;2005-07-13 16:00:00;2 seconds;Bright light illuminates daytime sky over Kerhonkson, NY at funeral for elderly witness to at least 2 UFOs In town for a funeral, several of us were leaving Humiston's in Kerhonkson, New York  when a bright flash occurred in the daytime sky lasting only a second or two.  There were no streaks in the sky, no trail left behind.  It all seemed to occur in one small spot, miles up in the sky. Family members immediately attributed the flash to the work of our deceased relative.  Though a meteor might explain the bright flash, the fact that flash occurred in only one small spot in the sky casts some doubt, as does the enormous intensity of the flash of light.  And, that doubt is what makes this flash of light unidentified.  I did not see the sky myself, but I did see the flash of light reflected on the ground and buildings, similar to a lightning strike, brighter than the sunlight which was bright that day.  It should be noted that the elderly relative whose funeral was in progress, was a witness to at least 2 UFO sightings, one in the 1970's and one mass sighting in the mid 80's, both of which she forever refused to talk about, taking the accounts of those sightings to her grave.
