Hudson Valley UFO, summer late 1980s;1989-08-08 20:00:00;2 minutes;Hudson Valley UFO, summer late 1980s It was somewhere between 1987 and 1989.  I was around 7 years old, living in the Hudson Valley in New York.  It was around 8pm  (I know because that was our bed time).  We faced West, South/west and the object headed south (I think)   As my parents were putting us to bed we noticed something to the south.  We lived beneath the landing path of the planes at Westchester Airport, so we always saw planes landing.  This was not a plane. This thing was miles away and, recently, my mother told me it was like a floating stadium.  I remember seeing, what I believe, was a single row of different colored lights.  I think the lights kept changing colors either that or they did something my mind could not conceive. The object moved very slowly.  I think it floated over the Saw Mill River Parkway.  Because of our location, we looked down towards the Saw Mill River Valley.  This object took up a decent portion of the sky and it did not move fast at all. We ran to my sister's room to get a better look at it. I was young and greatly impacted by this thing.  The one thought I remember was who is flying that thing?  I felt like I could look into the windows to see who was behind the wheel. Were there windows?  I don't know.  I do remember the eerie feeling that someone or something was watching our world from the inside of that ship. Years later I came across a picture of what might be the craft.  When we saw it, the craft was not tilted on its side.  It was completely horizontal.;41.1696;-73.7692
