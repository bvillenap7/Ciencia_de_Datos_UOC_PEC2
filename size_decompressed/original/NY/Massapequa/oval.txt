Had Binoculars, as I was looking for the Leonids a night late, and the objects were long and thin, horizontal.  Objects moved at a steady pace until they dissappeared out of view behind a house, moving lower on the horizon.  These did NOT appear to be meteorites at all.  The formation and objects remained unchanged for the 15 or so secodns I saw them moving and they appeared to be in the very upper atmosphere or out of it completely.  Frickin' weird looking, and a bit eerie, basically because they were so nondescript and moved slower than meteorites I've seen, but faster than jets I've seen.;40.6673;-73.4593000000002
