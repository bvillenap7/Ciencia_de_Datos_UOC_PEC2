It seemed to crawl across the sky.  It was daytime. A large reddish pink cylinder appeared overhead, much larger and further away then any of the planes flying in the area.  The cylinder seemed to be going in and out like a caterpiller.  It was East/West then it turned North/South.  It hovered overheard for what seemed like and hour.  We looked at it through binoculars, but the glare was too strong, since the sun was out.  We called several neighbors to come see, but no one was around.  We also contacted the local radio station.  We have never seen anything like this.  Eventually it moved slowly across the sky until we could not see it any longer.  At one point when it was almost gone it looked as though a fighter jet flew past it.  We didn't know where our camera was,none of us wanted to leave to go find it. We just wanted to stare at it and see what it was going to do. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.6673;-73.4593000000002
