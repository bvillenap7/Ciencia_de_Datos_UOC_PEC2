flashing ball of colorful lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star.  PD));2006-10-08 23:00:00;4 hours;flashing ball of colorful lights Its was around 11:00pm on one of the clearest nights I've seen here in NY.  I live on the south shore of Long Island.  I'm out on my deck smoking a cigarette, east southeast into the sky, flashing ball of light changing colors really fast.  Even though the object seemed really far, you could still make out that it wasn't a star, it was something I've never seen before.  The colors were incredible....It stayed in one spot, didn't move.  I went to bed and it was still there. I did try to capture it on my digital camera avi, but I doubt it will be clear.  If it didn't change colors the way it did, and if it didn't flash, I would say their was a possibility of this being a star, but I've been looking at stars since I was a kid, this did not look to be a star.  I hope its there again tonight. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star.  PD));40.6673;-73.4593000000002
