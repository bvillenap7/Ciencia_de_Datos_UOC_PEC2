single light in sky, very fast, and also hovering, and changing direction at 45 degree angles, and twinkling;2010-04-29 03:00:00;5 minutes;single light in sky, very fast, and also hovering, and changing direction at 45 degree angles, and twinkling in the early morning of 4/29/10, at approximately 3:00 (am), I went outside in my yard to have a cigarette, and let the dog out.  I was looking up at the stars, and noticed what I thought at first was a star.  it was kind of twinkling.  nothing strange at all.  until i realized that this light  was moving.  it was headed in a west direction, then went south, at a 45 degree angle.  then just stopped.  and remained there for about 2 minutes.  it then moved again north at a 45 degree angle, then west.  for about 30 seconds, then again, headed west. It gave off one last twinkle, then I could not see it anymore.  like I said, I thought it was a star, because thats what it looked like. ( size, shape, brightness)  Until i knew it was most definately moving.  from its distance, i could not tell where it was as far as location, somewhere over the south shore of nassau county, or perhaps over the water?   But, it WAS there.  i know what I saw.  my yard is dark, so ! at night, I have a beautiful view of the sky, and it was amazingly clear out, and a bit crisp.  I live close to an airfield (farmingdale), and at that time to my knowledge, there are no small craft flying, or weather ballons.  There is also a major air port (MacArthur) about 20 minutes east of me, but this was not a commercial airline, nor a small craft.   And at the angle at which it changed, its distance, and its speed, related to that distance.  there were no blinking lights, unless you would ascertain the twinkling  as such. did not leave a trail, and no sound.  I just thought I should tell someone outside of family and friends, well because of the obvious reactions.   I swear this is true, not a hoax, and accurate to the best of my ability.;40.6673;-73.4593000000002
clear sky, 2 light objects high above, joining each other, then shooting off towards the west. third sighting. first time;2010-06-01 01:00:00;45 seconds;clear sky, 2 light objects high above, joining each other, then shooting off towards the west. third sighting. first time for 2 to get ok, i have seen thislight for the third time now.  it looks like a star, rapidly moving, kind of a twinkling/dimming, followed by a brightness, then it disappears. the first time I reported this.  the second time I did not.  now the third time i am again, only because there seemed to have been two of them.  one travelling from east to west, very high in the sky, the ohter travelling north to north west, and meeting with the other light   it seemed to become one but then looked as if they were both very close together. this lasted for about 45 seconds, until at which one point, it just flashed, and shot out of sight, almost like a shooting star.( which it definately was not).  there is definately something going on in the skies above long island.   I have seen this on several occasions over the past number of years, but never reported anything.  but with the frequency of these sightings.   I am convinced there is something up there.

Six flying objects flew over Long Island together in formation very fast almost like 6 shooting stars in formation 8 pm.  Oct 6, 2015.;2015-10-06 21:00:00;1 minute;Six flying objects  flew over Long Island together in formation very fast almost like 6 shooting stars in formation 8 pm. Oct 6 2015 I was looking at the sky there seemed to be lots of movement in the stars I saw want seemed to be the a few stars/ lights almost visiting each other one would fly to the next.   Then I heard a siren from the firehouse and that's when I saw 5 or six ships flying together appear to cross overhead and head west.  I noticed they did not make a sound I was shaken by what I saw.  I wanted to call someone to tell them but who would believe such a crazy thing. I alway look at the sky at night I have never seen anything like this it was as if they where in a military formation I would say it was like seeing 6 mini fighter jets shooting through the sky at lightening speed.  So high in the stratosphere to be a jet plane flew in a smooth motion disappeared so fast like 6 shooting stars in a flight pattern formation.
