Circular orb in the sky covers great distance in short 30 seconds without breaking sound barrier on 7/4/13.;2013-07-04 22:30:00;30 seconds;Circular orb in the sky covers great distance in short 30 seconds without breaking sound barrier on 7/4/13. All six of us had noticed a yellow, circular orb in the sky.  Luckily we noticed it right away and we were able to see it travel the entire sky in 30 seconds.  In our estimate the object must have been 5 - 10 miles up at a minimum.   For the object to travel across the entire sky with out any sound barrier being broken befuddled all of us.  We were able to determine that it was not space junk or an asteroid due to the direction it was taking.  It went clear across the sky in a straight path, and not in a parabola direction.  First time any of us had seen anything like that.  Some people were scared, while others were just confused.  I thought it was really cool.;40.6673;-73.4593000000002
UFO sighting.;2015-11-14 23:00:00;5 minutes;UFO Sighting. The sky is extremely clear out tonight.  At first I thought it was an airplane until another appeared and they stood near each other and the flew off.  They had red and white flashing lights.   Then another 2 appeared over Burns Park and they crossed each other in an X shape and slowly flew in the sky back and then forth.   I know that there isn't an airport near Burns Park in Massapequa and the 2 that crossed look like they came from that area.;40.6673;-73.4593000000002

Large Bright White Light Moving slowly high above my house, no noise, then Stopped.;2017-04-12 21:00:00;15 minutes;Large Bright White Light Moving slowly high above my house, no noise, then Stopped Myself and my Wife witnessed a large bright white light moving slowly from the North West, to the South East.  It passed high over my house, and at first I thought it was a helicopter, but there was no noise coming from it, and it had no green or red flashing lights, just a large bright white light.  I though it was one of those bags with lite candles inside, to make it lift, but it was too white and too bright and it stopped, after it passed my house, I watched it for at least 15 minutes more and it did not move, and just looked like a very bright star?   I have been an engineer for many years, so I tried to rationalize what it could have been, but I cannot come up with any explanation of what it could be, I got up this morning and ran out to see if it was still hanging in the same location.  It was gone.;40.6673;-73.4593000000002
