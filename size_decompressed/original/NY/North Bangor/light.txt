After a few moments the object was beaming a ray of light off and on.  This went on for a few minutes.  My first thought was that it was a helicopter looking for marijuana crops, but thought it was odd to be looking at night for them.   After several minutes, a fighter jet from the west raced to its location flying low and circled for about 45 minutes afterwards.  The light had disappeared with the arrival of the jet.   For the next hour after that, I watched doughnut shaped chemical trails blow across the sky.;44.8542;-74.4139
