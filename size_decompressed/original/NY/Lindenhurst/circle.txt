Yellow/orange orb shoots across sky in Lindenhurst, NY at approximately 9:00pm edt.;2013-07-07 20:59:00;1-2 minutes;Yellow/ orange orb shoots across sky in Lindenhurst, NY at approximately 9:00pm edt. On the evening of July 7, 2013, about a dozen people were gathered on a patio in Lindenhurst, Suffolk County, Long Island, NY.   My husband grabbed my arm just as I stood up & told others to look up.  There was a large, circular yellow-orange orb shooting through the sky.   It traveled straight across the sky and slowly faded & disappeared from sight.   We are all in agreement that this was something out of the ordinary.  It was not a plane, not a shooting star.   We believe, based on other recent sightings, that this may have been a UFO.;40.6914;-73.3728000000001
