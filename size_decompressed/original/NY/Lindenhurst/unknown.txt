The satilight went south to north and kept the same constant speed. Then 5 min later what appeared to be another satilight stopped in flight and became very bright, it was the brightest thing in the sky for five to ten seconds. Then the object moved on and stopped again and the light came back the same way. That same scenario happen for about a minute and a half, and the object was moving from side to side then vanished.;40.6914;-73.3728000000001
