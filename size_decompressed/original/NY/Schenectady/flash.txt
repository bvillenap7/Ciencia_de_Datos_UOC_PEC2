PD));2013-01-25 06:02:00;10 seconds;While driving to my job on Friday morning, January 25, 2013, I witnessed what I thought was a shooting star or firework.  There was no sound at all.   No sooner then my mind could make any sense of this, a huge greenish flash illuminated the wooded area around me. I looked up at what appeared to be a greenish ball of light that appeared to fall downward.  Everything from a plane to a helicopter crashing ran through my mind, and I anticipated a boom after this bright flash of light, but there was no boom. I sped onward toward my job which was right down the road.  My instinct was to just get away from whatever this was.  The event left me shaking.;42.8011755918368;-73.9326240000005
Flashing blue object traveling at high rate of speed over Schenectady, NY;2014-10-14 20:35:00;10 seconds;Flashing blue object traveling at high rate of speed over Schenectady, NY I took astronomy in high school and have been an amateur star gazer ever since.  I am an avid watcher of science programs about the universe and stars and all things pertaining to the study and science of space and the bodies in it.  I also live close to two airports that have both civilian and military aircraft both fixed wing and helicopters.   What I saw was a flashing blue light traveling at a very high rate of speed.  It appeared oval in shape. There were no other lights other than blue.  It traveled from the North West to the South East.  I observed it for approximately 10 seconds before it was out of sight;42.8011755918368;-73.9326240000005
