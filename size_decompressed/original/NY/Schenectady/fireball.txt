9/12/12  Rotterdam, NY fireball 20:30  Six fireballs floated over residence uiformly spaced  7min. 9/14/12 14:20;2012-09-12 20:30:00;5-7 minutes;9/12/12  Rotterdam, NY fireball 20:30  Six fireballs floated over residence uiformly spaced  7min. 9/14/12 14:20 Leaving for work(night shift)saw light orange colored objects at about the altitude of a small aircraft. They were traveling south to north right over my residence as what seemed like individual fireballs moving at about the speed of an aircraft would. My home is in a flight path so I see small planes flying almost every night leaving at same time. But these were spaced about 20 seconds apart.  There's a street light in front of my house so I went to the rear of house to get a better view,also asking my wife and son to observe what I saw.  These objects made no sound. i mentioned this to a co-worker and he stated that there is an annual hot air balloon show but that doesn't start until Sept.20.Also didn't think  Hot air balloons would travel at night if not necessary.  Just curious if there were any other people watching the sky on that clear night.  Sincerely,Dan Shields;42.8011755918368;-73.9326240000005
