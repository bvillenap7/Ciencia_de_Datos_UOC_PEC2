All three banked around and the two domes were in front of the Airplane when the two took separate directions, upwards in a V to what appeared to be out of the Airplanes way.  When we reach our house I called the Albany Airport and spoke to the Air Control tower and explained to him what I just witnessed, he did advise me that there were 2 blimps on radar that he could not explain and the offer me Peter's Davenports number which I called and to my amazement Peter Davenport was in Albany that AM>....?? Weird....I Sent Peter A hand drawing of my sighting and that night the local New Station was interviewing me for the 600 news....  I do believe that we are not alone. I guess someday we will all be on the same page, but for now only a few at a time. One last memory of this, it was as if I were looking through a vertal blind and someone was rasing and lowering it very quickly. like the old Vaudeville movies in black and white. ((NUFORC Note:  I remember having spoken to this individual, despite the fact that it has been over six years since we spoke.  I was impressed with his sincerity, and he submitted a wonderful written report with an illustration.  PD));42.8011755918368;-73.9326240000005
2 red objects in a diagonal form.;2012-11-30 22:20:00;10 minutes;2 red objects in a diagonal form. At approximately 10:20pm I had just got home from work.  Looked into the sky to see 2 Red Dots in a diagonal form that seemed to keep the same distance apart.  Moved relatively slowly.  About 10min later vanished. I would have taken a photo but did not have a camera at the time.;42.8011755918368;-73.9326240000005
Massive 6 bright white lights in a line, slightly arched, then changed into reddish orange light ball and disappeared.;2016-11-16 22:15:00;1-2 minutes;Massive 6 bright white lights in a line, slightly arched, then changed into reddish orange light ball and disappeared. I was driving to get something to eat @ 10:15pm.  When I was about to turn the corner in the opposite direction, I saw out the corner of my eye, what I thought would have been the moon-I saw 6 distinct bright white lights in a line, slightly arched...stretching from the South to the North miles across one part of the sky wayyyyy to the other side.  A dark shadow also could be seen behind the lights.   They were moving West.  I started to follow them in my car.  My radio was staticy.  Then within 30 secs of following-they changed into 1 reddish orange light.  The white lights never moved or changed positions or faded out.  It was just all these white lights, then the reddish orange and then it was gone.  No sound, no streak of light.  A little flicker from red to orange.  It was just there so massive and then gone.  The cell phone battery was no where near dead, but as soon as the camera opened the phone died.;42.8011755918368;-73.9326240000005
