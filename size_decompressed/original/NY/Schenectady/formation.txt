Line of equally spaced ornage lights moving at an incredible speed, over Schenectady, New York;2003-07-25 23:00:00;3-4 seconds;Line of equally spaced ornage lights moving at an incredible speed, over Schenectady, New York My girlfriend and I were sitiing out in the backyard from about 10:15pm onwards, looking at the stars and what I still presume were the moving lights of sattelites up very high. At around 11pm I was talking to her and looking up at the sky when I noticed an orange blur racing across the sky. As I fixed my eyes on it, I saw 5 dull orange lights, all spaced the same distance apart, in a line, moving across the sky at an INCREDIBLE speed. I yelled out to my girlfriend, who also managed to see them (describing them to me afterwards). They were all the way across the sky in a matter of seconds. In comparison to planes we hade watched heading over to and from Albany International, these lights seemed to be not too high up.There was no sound. The speed was incredible. If you did not happen to fix your eyes on them, I'm sure you would not even notice them.I ESTIMATE the direction was east, following the line of Route 7 and other roads that head over to the Latham (North of Albany) area.;42.8011755918368;-73.9326240000005
