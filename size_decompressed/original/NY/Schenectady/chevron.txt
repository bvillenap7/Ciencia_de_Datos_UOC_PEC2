There was no movement.  Those traveling on near by road pulled over to join others and no one spoke.  All they did was stare into the dusk night sky and stare at this large craft with various colors, lights, flashing. The strange thing about this, no one reported it to the press, news, etc., and even though those who stood near their cars were in some sort of trance, those in the family, still do not speak about it.  When something comes up, they ignore the entire situation.  They do admit it happened, and once ran into the living area when a craft resembling the one hanging in the sky, still and quiet was shown on TV. So, a family sees this craft and others, and no one reports on the situation.;42.8011755918368;-73.9326240000005
