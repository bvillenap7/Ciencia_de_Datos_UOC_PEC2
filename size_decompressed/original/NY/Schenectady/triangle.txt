very high speed object;2008-10-07 23:00:00;2 seconds;very high speed object flew by north to south noticed directly above and it shot straight across then simply vanished. bright white light with red light around it. Was not one of the following.  comet. no trail and it had a light  airplane. only if we have created a plane that flies that fast  satellite. see them all of the time it it was not one  space station. we watch this fly by and I have ruled it out due to lights  When the space station flies by you see it fade as it passes by. This went by at an altitude that was lower than a commercial plane and it covered the visible sky in a matter of two seconds;42.8011755918368;-73.9326240000005
