UFO sighted in Schenectady County 02/28/2014.;2014-02-28 18:00:00;5 minutes;UFO sighted in Schenectady County 02/28/2014. My boyfriend and I we're driving home when I looked West and noticed 5 vapor trails coming from Jets in different directions.  We both thought it looked really cool but knew that the air had been cold making the vapor more visible.  Suddenly I noticed an object triangular, and then round (seemed to change) and come in and out of the trails, it was darting back and forth through the vapor, it was silver with a red light on the bottom, but then would change to very dark gray or black.   It was moving so quickly that we knew it couldn't be a Plane and the fact that the shape and color seemed to change was very odd.   We also noticed that at times it would just hover for a moment like it was waiting for something?   We tried to follow it as long as we could but we're driving north west on a highway and had to intersect so we lost it.  It amazed both of us and I have not stopped thinking about it since.   Have there been any other sightings in our area such as this?;42.8011755918368;-73.9326240000005
