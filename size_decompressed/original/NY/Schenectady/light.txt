On september 11 after the national tragidies, when all air traffic was banned, I was lying in bed looking out my open window into the sky, when i saw a flash of light scream across the sky.  It took seconds to go in and out of sight, but it wasn't a meteroite.  There is no photographs or anything, but i thought i would just send my thoughts in. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness remains anonymous.

Cloud dwelling lights in the sky;2003-10-18 21:00:00;1 our;Cloud dwelling lights in the sky My father was the first to notice them, he called me out to my front lawn. In the sky were to different lights moving around in the sky. The odd things were that they only appeared in the clouds, not in the sky, and they changed direction. After about twenty minutes another one joined them. My mother and two brothers came out to see them. All three were spining in an oval, and would disapear once they left from the clouds into the sky, then they would reapear once they entered there part of orbit that was in the sky. About twenty minutes later a fourth one joined them. Thats when there orbit changed. It spined counterclockwise in a circle, and after completing a few rotations the lights would cross and end up on then continue spinning. Then as the clouds floated away, we lost visual of them. I called the airport to see if they new anything about it, and they didn't. I took a picture of them when there were four, I could only see two of them in the picture, then I enhanced it, and I counted seventeen. This whole occurance lasted about an hour ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been observing a spinning advertising light.  PD));42.8011755918368;-73.9326240000005
Bright Light over Schenectady.;2008-08-02 17:53:00;30 seconds;Bright Light over Schenectady. On Saturday, August 2nd, at approximately 9:53 PM I saw what appeared to be a VERY bright light moving across the sky. It was a bright, white light that was moving in a east/southeast direction. About 2/3rds of the way across the sky, it STOPPED, did what I would describe as a reverse S , then it stopped again. It remained in one spot for about 15 seconds, becoming dimmer and dimmer. When it was almost totally dim... It winked in a southerly direction. When I say winked, it looked like a tiny streak for a split second.Total elapsed time was about 30 seconds.

Circle of Light Seen In Morning Sky;2008-10-03 08:13:00;1 Minute;Circle of Light Seen In Morning Sky On October 3, 2008 at approximately 8:13 am I was driving southeast on Lishakill Road in Colonie, New York when I looked up very high in the morning sky to see a bright light in between trees.  It was moving at a quick rate of speed and I only saw it for approximately one minute because the trees were in the way.  At first I thought it was a search light, but then I thought I saw what appeared to be fire on one side of the circle.  It was a very cloudy morning and I do not believe it was the sun.  I noticed in my rear view mirror the car behind me was driving in the middle of the road and down the road on the left was a Colonie police officer blocking a side street.  When I arrived at work at approximately 8:25 am I told my coworkers of the experience.  Less than 40 minutes later my coworkers and I saw a fighter jet took off from Albany International and it circled around and headed in the direction where I had the sighting.  The article in today's Times Union newspaper (October 4, 2008) states that a Hornet fighter jet did take off from Albany International and circled around RPI in Troy, New York.

Extremely Bright Ball of light streaming downward from sky behind tree tops and to the horizon around midnight in upstate NY.;2013-01-21 00:00:00;2.5 seconds;Extremely Bright Ball of light streaming downward from sky behind tree tops and to the horizon around midnight in upstate NY. At approximately midnight last night (January 21, 2013), I was in bed watching television when in the window just to my left, a very bright light immediately drew my attention to focus on the window.  The light came from the sky above traveling sort of straight down in path not unlike large bright fireworks coming down out of the sky downward.  The color was mostly bright white and I think I detected just a hint of yellow and maybe some blue - again it looked almost like a bright ball or stream of light heading downward behind the treetops and into the horizon. I awaited a boom or was expecting to feel the impact it was so bright. It was kind of unnerving thinking it was a missle or somthing. But nothing, just silence.  No vibration from impact. So I assumened it must have been very far away. The direction for my viewing point would have been roughly facing South East.  The path of the bright ball or stream of light took about 2 to 3 seconds to travel from sky to horizon and out of site behind the trees as viewed through my bedroom window.  Again it was so bright that I thought is was fireworks landing in the woods 50 yards behind my house.  I got up, startling my wife, and stared out at that part of the sky and woods for 10 minutes or so, but not a trace of any other type of activity accept twinkling stars.   That's it. I searched the internet today and did find where a number of other sightings in upstate NY and PA were very very much like mine at the same time of night. It was relieving to see others had seen what I had seen apparently.  Thank you for having this forum for describing such experiences.;42.8011755918368;-73.9326240000005
