Bright green-white light flying soundlessly overhead;1998-09-23 04:50:00;15 seconds;Bright green-white light flying soundlessly overhead I'm an 8-year veteran police officer. While leaving for work on a crisp, cold, clear, starlight morning I stopped before entering my jeep. Above, against a starlight night, I saw a green-white orb traveling southeast through the sky. It was twice as bright as the North Star, soundless, and traveling half as fast as a shooting star--much faster than any plane I've ever seen. There were no other navagation or strobe lights on it. I was alone and thought it odd. I felt no strange paralysis or anything like that I just watched it fluedly traverse the sky in one straight, quick, silent slash then I went to work. I only saw this one object. It seemed far away, high in the sky, much too bright to be a star, and much too fast to be a plane. I'm a well educated person and a realist. I don't know if there are any spooky grey beings out there or what our government is testing. But I know I witnessed something I've never seen before and I thought you should know about it.;42.8011755918368;-73.9326240000005
