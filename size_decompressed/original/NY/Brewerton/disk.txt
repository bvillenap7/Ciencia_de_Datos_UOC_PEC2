A U.F.O. landed in my small suburban town.;2008-12-02 21:00:00;30 Seconds;A U.F.O. landed in my small suburban town. I was at work headed between two building when I looked up at the sky and saw a what I believe to be a flying saucer.  It was no larger than a single story house and couldn't have been more than 12 feet tall, it was saucer shaped.   The U.F.O. had a flat bottom with walls roughly 3 feet and then a steadily rising roof, finally coming to a point when it rose up like scoop of ice cream.  It had very few lights on the outside of it, but it appeared to glow white.   The saucer was circling lower and lower like a bird until it dipped below the tree line out of my sight.  I got out of work about ten minutes later and walked down the rail road tracks to investigate but found nothing.   The craft was only in my sight for roughly 30 seconds at exactly 9:05pm.  At the same time my relatives less than a mile down the road from my work saw bright lights outside the living room window, they assumed it was a police helicopter but now recall that they did not hear any noise.  The craft appeared to land, and I did not see it take off again.;43.2252;-76.1351
