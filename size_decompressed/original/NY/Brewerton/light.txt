It was suspended above a field at the end of dark road near my house. At first I thought it may have been a distant planet, but then realized it was hovering within our atmosphere.  As I drove down the road toward the open field to get a better look, the orb began to shimmer and starburst, splintering in all directions. Just as I closed in on the end of the road where the field opens up, I realized the orb was much closer to the ground, approximately a thousand yards.  At that moment the orb, within seconds, became pixelated and dissolved before my eyes.  My adrenaline had been pumping, but I had trouble recalling the moment before I drove down the road to get a better look. It was hard to discern if I had been watching for 30 seconds or 10 minutes. I would say the event lasted between 5 and 10 minutes in total.;43.2252;-76.1351
Very bright white and orange swirling stationary orb.;2021-02-24 05:35:00;5 minutes;Very bright white and orange swirling stationary orb. Around 5:30 am, I saw a shimmering light hovering in the early morning sky. Earlier this month, I witnessed the same shimmering, hovering light behaving the exact same way, in a different location near my neighborhood. The light orb glittered and would starburst so bright it almost appeared to change shape. It was a swirling ball of white and orange. i watched it through the trees for about 5 minutes until I walked further into the road to get a better look. I lost sight of it, and upon returning to my original vantage point, it had disappeared. (within 30 seconds) The light I saw earlier this month appeared to be above a swampy pond. This time, based on my positioning, I surmise it was hovering very low above Oneida Lake, a large body of water roughly 2 miles from where i live.;43.2252;-76.1351
