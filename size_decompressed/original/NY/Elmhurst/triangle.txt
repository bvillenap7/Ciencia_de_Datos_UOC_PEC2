large low altitude motionless and brightly lit triangular object appearing in overcast dawn sky over Elmhurst, NY;2007-12-14 05:30:00;30 minutes;large low altitude motionless and brightly lit triangular object appearing in overcast dawn sky over Elmhurst, NY I had come home just before dawn and noticed an extremely bright object hanging motionless in the sky as I was walking in my parking area.   At first I thought it was a star or satellite but it seemed oddly low and much too bright in an overcast sky. The few stars I could detect were extremely faint in comparison.  I was transfixed by the object which dominated the sky and appeared to be triangular in shape and stood watching it for about 15 minutes. Finally, a neighbor was leaving for work and she also agreed it was an unfamiliar object. I called the FBI but I think they dismissed me as a crackpot. The weird thing is that about 11 hours later a manhole cover exploded on my street and we lost power for a little while. It's just one of those eerie feelings you sense when something is out of context in the world as we know it.;40.7356;-73.8711
