I was 17 at the time and I was camping in the woods with a group of friends.  It was about 3am and we were all laying on our backs talking and getting ready to go to sleep.  We had a campfire that was lighting up the canopy of the trees.  There was no wind and the forest was very quiet.   Suddenly a small disk shaped object about a foot across and about 10 feet off the ground flew directly over the fire and traveled out of sight in a perfectly strait line.  The only sound it made was a swhoosh as it passed.  It appeared to be metallic and about an inch thick, it had no lights or anything else -- very plain looking. My other friends saw it too and they were as stunned as I was.  There was no reasonable explanation for it.  The forest was covered in dry leaves and if this thing was thrown, we would have heard it land, not to mention heard the person who threw it. It was moving at about 15mph and I was able to see it for about 100 ft before I lost it in the darkness.   The fire was bright and we all got a good look at it, it was a very bizarre event.
