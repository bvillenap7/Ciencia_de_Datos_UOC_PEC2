green fire ball seen in the sky 3/4 the size of the moon.;1998-12-10 03:19:00;3seconds;green fire ball seen in the sky 3/4 the size of the moon. i saw a green fireball for about 3 seconds looking east.It was moving from the 2o'clock position to the 8o'clock position. The fireball was about as big as 3/4 of the size of a full moon.There was redish gold fire around it with a tail that was 4 times it's length.The tail was silver and it sparkled and glittered like fire works. I have seen shooting stars a lot of them and this was like none i have seen before.I drive a truck at night 21:00 hr.to 06:00hr. so i spened alot of time outside in the dark. thank you!;42.9678;-77.2283
