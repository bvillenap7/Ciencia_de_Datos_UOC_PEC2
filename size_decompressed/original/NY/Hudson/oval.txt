Objects were spaced apart by 1-2 minutes, with at least 12 visible at one time across the sky.  The Stream of Orange glowing lights lasted about an hour and a half. The objects seemed to go to a higher altitude, almost disappearing, when an airplane approached its path, and then descended and returned to previous altitude.  There was also a considerable amount of regular airplane traffic at the time at which did not seem to be affected.  Time of first sitting (sic.  sighting) was between 9pm and 9:10pm and lasted till just after 10:30pm Eastern daylight Saving Time.  The orange objects were greatly larger than any airplane seen in the air at the time.  The speed of the objects crossing the sky from my view was about the rate of conventional aircraft, 3 to 4 minutes to cross the sky until fading out of view.  The motion seemed to be as smooth as silk, compared to watching a conventional airplane.  Have never seen anything like this before ever.;42.2478000000001;-73.7539999999999
