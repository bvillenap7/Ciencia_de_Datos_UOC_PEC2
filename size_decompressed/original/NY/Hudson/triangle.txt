Large triangular object hovers thein streaks across sky.;2004-07-03 23:00:00;2 min;Large triangular object hovers thein streaks across sky. very bright light observed north west horizon. Ihave a boat on Hudson river.light was 10 times brighter than jupitor.Iasked my wife what that could be.picked my binoculars up to look at it. It seemed to ber stationary for acouple of minutes. It started to movetoward our location at avery high rate of speed.A jet liner travels through the sky at 600mph. this object moved at least 10 times that speed. It coverd the whole visble sky,north to south in about 10 seconds.As itwent over head Iwas looking at it with binoculars.Icould see the bottom of it. It was a perfect triangle, with a dim row of lights under each edge.It was very high up.Judging by the size of it at that distance,It must have been very large.;42.2478000000001;-73.7539999999999
Blinking red, constant green, and glowing white lighted triangular aircraft above Hudson, NY on 4/11/10;2010-04-11 21:00:00;10 minutes;Blinking red, constant green, and glowing white lighted triangular aircraft above Hudson, NY on 4/11/10 As I was star gazing from my balcony on this night, I noticed a red flashing light in the distance.  I watched it for a few minutes and then called my roommate out to the balcony to watch with me because the blinking red light was not moving as if it were the lights on a plane.  There was a constant green light that was always directly in front of the blinking red light.  The blinking red light moved to the left as if it were flying in that direction and then as if turning, started moving right.  As it turned, the red light turned bright white.  After the turn, it began flying to the right again and the light again became a red flashing light.  This same pattern occurred for about 5 minutes until it seemed as though the object shot something off of it to the left, which was a white light (kind of like a small white spec or star).  After this occurred, the object went slowly straight up in the sky.  It then started to slowly fly in our direction and ended up ! flying slowly directly overtop of us.  It was then that we noticed the triangle shape....the constant green light was to the left, the blinking red light was to the right, and a bright, glowing white light was above the two other lights.  It flew directly above our heads, but there was no sound.;42.2478000000001;-73.7539999999999
Dark, triangle-shaped craft with shimmering, moving light & five fixed lights, seen over Hudson, NY;2017-05-15 02:30:00;6-8 minutes;Dark, triangle-shaped craft with shimmering, moving light & five fixed lights, seen over Hudson, NY At approximately 2:30am on Monday, May 15th, 2017, I went out into the backyard to take out the garbage. It was a clear night, so I sat down on the porch and leaned back to do some star gazing. A few minutes in, I noticed that some of the stars were moving, in tandem.  I focused in on that area, and there were 5 “stars” in a V-formation.  I realized that it was a fairly large triangle-shaped craft of some sort, because I could see the dark shape blocking actual stars from view, as it passed overhead. It appeared to be quite low in the sky, was quiet, and moved slowly.  A shimmering light passed all over the bottom of the craft several times, independent of the five V-formation lights.  I watched it cross the sky until I couldn’t make it out any longer.  I’m not far from Stewart International Airport (public/military), and suppose it might have been a military plane. Of note, the street lamp on the corner went out while the craft passed over, then started glowing slightly until it reached the normal light, seemed to get brighter than usual and orange-tinted, and abruptly went out again.  The lamp remained dark afterwards.  The bulb probably burned out and the timing coincidental but it was odd, so I thought that I’d mention it, in the case that anyone else had witnessed a similar coincidence.;42.2478000000001;-73.7539999999999
