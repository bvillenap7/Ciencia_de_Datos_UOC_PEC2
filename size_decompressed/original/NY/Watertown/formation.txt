Five Objects Seen in Sky over Watertown, New York;2003-12-26 13:30:00;6-7 minutes;Five Objects Seen in Sky over Watertown, New York Sky was clear blue, with very few whispy clouds very high up. I saw 4 objects in the sky directly over Watertown NY below the level of the clouds (background blue sky). I was wearing sunglasses, and could see them clearly while I looked through my glasses, when I looked without them they became alomost impossible to see. The sun was reflecting off of them, and one was distinctly V shaped. They were metallic, as they reflected the orange glow of the sun. They appeared stationary at first, but as I stood there, I saw they were moving south. One by one they seemed to wink out Before the last one winked out, I saw a large, slow-moving white streak approach it, as it flew past it, the v shaped object winked out. I watched this long white streak move very slowly across the sky, it left no kind of vapor trail at all. I watched it for several minutes before my view of it was obscured by buildings. Again, you could only really see it with sunglasses on. When I removed my glasses, it simply blended in with the sky. It did not appear to be an airplane, it was far too long in shape, and it left no vapor trail. Neither did the 4 other objects. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
