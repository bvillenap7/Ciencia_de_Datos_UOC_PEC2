Last night me and my girlfriend were watching a meteor shower, as we were doing that we noticed red and white flashing lights in the sky which was pretty far away towards the south as we kept looking we noticed another one which was west and another one which was north they were all far away so we just kept watching the meteor shower and seeing if the objects were coming closer or not. Than my girlfriend pointed and said “Look there is another one” and as I looked it was flying right over my house and over my head going west and we were looking east and when I seen it from the front it looked rounded and as it went over I could not tell the shape of it but there was multiple lights under it flashing red than white than red again.  And eventually it disappeared in the sky.  We also live out in country with not many buildings around us so I knew that the other objects could not be a radio tower or anything.;43.9747379310346;-75.9086758620685
