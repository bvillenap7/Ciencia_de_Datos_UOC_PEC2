Black triangular object scene in Watertown New York.;2011-11-15 21:30:00;1 minute;Black triangular object scene in Watertown New York. A friend and I were testing out my new telescope at Thompson Park and around 21:15, I decided it was too cold to keep going and started packing up.  This park has very little lighting and no lighting along the paths to get down the hill.  As we walked down the path, I noticed a large black triangular object hovering above some woods. It appeared that the sky was missing but a couple of seconds later it moved in my direction swooping over my friend and I and then it flew very quickly out of sight.  I told my friend what I just saw and he didn't believe me.   Up until that point I didn't believe in UFOs and I did not believe in Intelligent life from beyond Earth but this small and short event changed my mind.   I haven't seen anything since then but I havnt been to the park at night since then.;43.9747379310346;-75.9086758620685
