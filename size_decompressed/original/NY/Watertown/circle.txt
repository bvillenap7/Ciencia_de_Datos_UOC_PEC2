Two lights traveling in sync dissapeared behind the moon.;1998-06-07 23:00:00;2 minutes;Two lights traveling in sync dissapeared behind the moon. Two lights in the sky flew over our heads vey high and fast in the atmosphere. It was a full moon night and we watched as they flew over head. They were very high so we assumed either an airplane or satelite. The only problem is that they were in a course with the moon. They flew in to the path of the moon but never came out of the otherside. I was currently at this time enlisted whith the New York national guard. I was some what injured at the time and just wrote it off to being satelites, but now I am a little curious to what it might have been. I have no real proof other than a handful of soldiers and my-self were watching. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));43.9747379310346;-75.9086758620685
Very fast moving lights that showed a circular formation red and sometimes orange and white.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star?  PD));2010-05-30 10:30:00;2 hr;Very fast moving lights that showed a circular formation.  The lights were red and sometimes orange and white.  The objects moved with a very fast zig zag path never straight unless it was stopped and then it appeared to be hovering.  We live near an army base so at first thought it could be manuevers until the objects became more numerous.  They were directly moving from the east to the west.  The lights appeared to be moving around in a circle simultaneously while the entire object zig zagged it is very hard to explain without seeing it.;43.9747379310346;-75.9086758620685
