4 lighs in shape of box over city;2011-09-01 20:30:00;30 seconds;4 lighs in shape of box over city My fiancee and I were driving into Watertown from Watertown Center.  I think it was a Sunday.  This is the first Watertown Exit when approaching the city from the south via Interstate 81.   We were about a half a mile outside of town and rounded the bend with the guardrails, before the straight shot to Washington St.  Upon rounding the bend there were 4 large lights in the sky above the city.  The lights themselves were circular with almost the same hue as a street light but you could tell they were significantly larger than a street light.  They were definitely at a distance and in the direction of Fort Drum.  Without knowing the size of the lights I cannot determine if they were over Watertown or much farther north.   The lights formed a rectangular pattern. 2 on top. 2 on bottom.  Upon rounding the corner all were fully visible. I probably looked at them for a good 5 seconds before asking my fiancee are you seeing this?.  She did as well see them.   Immediately, the top two lights began to fade out and then disappeared. Immediately following that, the bottom two lights completely disappeared with no fade at all.  It was extremely bizarre and slightly unsettling.  Even more bizarre was a news announcement the Friday before that the military would be testing Fighter Jets and to not be alarmed by the noise.  I can assure you these were not fighter jets. Unless they somehow could fly in a perfect box pattern miles apart and were outfitted with extremely large lights.   Lived here 20 years. Right next to drum and have seem hundreds of military flares, helicopters, transport planes.  All the usual stuff.  But I have never seen something like this.   I finally decided I should share it as we couldn't have been the only ones to see it.  It was HUGE! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
