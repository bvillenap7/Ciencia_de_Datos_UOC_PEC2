My son and I were looking for galaxies through our telescope in the constellation Leo when suddenly we noticed an object moving directly across it to the North.   At first I didn't think anything of it because that night we had seen three planes and five satellites crossing the sky in the same area.  This object flashed a strange bluish-white light that gave off a sharp triangular appearance.  I soon realized that it couldn't have been a plane because those give off repetative rythmical flashes.  This object's flash was not like that.  It would flash, pause a second, flash two or three times, pause a couple seconds, then back to one flash, then one long pause, then flash again.  It just repeated like this, very unrandomly for about 7 or 8 secs.   Then suddenly and without warning it made a sharp and quick 90% turn west, flashed again, then was gone.  I also noticed that when it wasn't flashing, the object seemed to have a grayish-metallic spherical appearance to it.    I don't know what I saw, I just know I've never seen anything like it before. I should also probably mention that an aircraft came to the exact position of this object.  It arrived only seconds after it left.;43.9747379310346;-75.9086758620685

I had stepped out on our back porch to smoke a cigarette and I looked up in the sky and saw, what I thought at the time was a shooting star.  Then I saw one more and then another and by the forth I yelled into the house for my family to come and see these “moving stars”.  Everyone came out and saw them I looked at another part of the sky and saw four more as did everyone else.  At this point my stepfather who is an active duty military officer had stepped out to see what was happening.  He too witnessed the lights.  It was partly cloudy but we were still able to see the stars and the lights and tell the difference between the two I witnessed about twenty-five myself.  My mother saw about 12 and my sister saw about 15. My stepfather caught the last of them and says he saw 5.  I thought at first it might have just been a meteor shower but all of the lights we! re moving in the same direction at what seemed like the same speed.  They were all roughly the same size and shape.  I checked the charts for meteor showers and it said that the last shower was May 6, and the next isn’t until August 12.;43.9747379310346;-75.9086758620685
