We observed 3 objects with multi-color lights which were stationary over our house for 3  1/2 hrs.;2000-09-06 22:00:00;3.5 hrs.;We observed 3 objects with multi-color lights which were stationary over our house for 3  1/2 hrs. At around 10:00 p.m. on 09/06/00, my husband and I were driving home and noticed an  UN-MOVING, star-like object in the west sky that had RED, GREEN and WHITE blinking lights. We stopped and also saw an identical object in the east, also stationary with consantly blinking lights. They were sized like a pea at arms length. After arriving home, we watched them with binoculars in the clear starlit sky for 3 and 1/2 hours, one on each side of our property. After 2 hours we saw a third identical object, though a bit dimmer or at a greater distance from us, that was located a short distance (about 1/2 inch) NW of the eastern-most object. Though I think we may have observed unusual objects or events a couple times before, this is our first report. We are college-educated, rational but curious about these events. We also had observed many PARALLEL and CROSSED CHEM-TRAILS over our area that same afternoon and early evening. ((NUFORC Note:  The report of multi-colored objects, stationary in the night sky, seems reminiscent of twinkling stars.  We will invite the witnesses to look at the night sky again to confirm.  On the issue of chemtrails, we do not understand how witnesses on the ground could distinguish between normal contrails, of which there are many, and the alleged chemtrails.

Repeat sighting of 9/6/00, with 3 stationary, star-like objects in a triangle formation constantly blinking red, green and white lights;2000-09-13 21:00:00;3 hrs.;Repeat sighting of 9/6/00, with 3 stationary, star-like objects in a triangle formation constantly blinking red, green and white lights Exactly 1 week later, they've come back! On 9/6/00, I reported a sighting to you of 3 stationary, star-like objects which were constantly blinking red, green, and white lights lasting a period of 3 1/2 hrs. over our area of Williamsville, NY. I've watched the skies for a week now and last night (9/13/00) they were back. My husband and I saw the first object last night at 9 p.m. in the clear SSE sky. Tiny and un-moving like a star, but visibly blinking red, green and white lights. We searched the sky for any other objects and found 2 identical objects at the NE and WNW sky. We watched these objects fixed in this triangle formation for 3 hrs. until they were obscured by overcast clouds. Except for their position, these objects were identical to the objects seen 7 days ago and like last week's sighting, there were an unusally high number of other aircraft flying about them. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably twinkling stars, or other celestial bodies, we feel.  PD));42.9685000000015;-78.7492000000012
Hovering light seen over Williamsville, NY;2004-10-11 23:15:00;9 minutes;Hovering light seen over Williamsville, NY On Oct. 11, 2004 at approximately 11:15 PM, I looked out my bedroom window again as I was going to bed to make sure there were no sign of unknown individuals taking building materials from my development, since it happened twice this summer.  While looking at the South-western sky, I noticed a steady, unblinking light hovering approximately 5 degrees over the tree line.  While I watched the unmoving light, another light appeared to approach the hovering light from the south-east (left) at approximately 2 degrees above the tree line, at times passing behind the branches.  This light moved relatively fast and appeared to veer back off to the left before reaching the hovering light.  I'm not sure if I saw red and green aircraft warning lights on the bottom of the moving light, as it dissappeared behind the trees and I was focusing mainly on the hovering light.  I briefly walked away from the window to fully shut off the sink faucet in the bathroom across from my bedroom so as not to wake my parents up, and when I returned to the window the hovering light had appeared to have shifted to the left by a few degrees, although I could have been standing at a different portion of the window.  As I continued to watch, a plane came over the trees to the left of hovering light and passed over my neighborhood, banking and showing it's distinctive red and green belly lights as I heard the usual airplane sounds.  After the plane dissapeared to the south-east, the light continued to hover for maybe two more minutes, and I had begun to think it might be a light on a cellphone tower or something, before it slowly began to drift to the south-east (left) passing behind the trees, and appearing to stop and move back a short ways to the right before resuming it's course to the left.  Also, as the light began moving, it changed in color from a bright white to a dull amber color.  After that, I lost sight of the light and checking the time it was 11:24.;42.9685000000015;-78.7492000000012
Four UFO's sighted over WIlliamsville, NY;2004-10-22 21:15:00;9-10 minutes;Four UFO's sighted over WIlliamsville, NY While talking to my friend on the phone at 9:15 pm, I glanced out my bedroom window towards the southeast sky and noticed a light moving slowly across it to the left.  Figuring it was a plane, I grabbed my camera just to see how well the zoom would work at that distance, and lined the light up near the center.  When I lowered the camera, two more lights had appeared to the right of the first light, with one being distinctly further back, forming a triangle pattern.  The first light moved behind some trees, while the two newer ones remained hovering for a few moments.  Then, the one that was more distant that had been at the center of the triangle began moving to the left as well, before disappearing behind the same trees as the first one.  The third and rightmost one had begun moving as well, and I managed to take some photos of it as it moved to the left.  As the final light flickered behind the same stand of trees as the first two, a fourth light suddenly appeared near where the middle light had been.  This light only hovered for a few seconds, a minute at the most, before it vanished as suddenly as it had appeared.  This was at approximately 9:24 pm.  The entire time I described what was happening to my friend, and continued to talk to him for approximately ten minutes afterwards, at which point I began writing this report.  All three of the lights were a dull orange color the entire time, with no change in intensity or shape.;42.9685000000015;-78.7492000000012
Three red lights in the low sky over Williamsville, NY.;2012-07-06 23:30:00;2 minutes;Three red lights in the low sky over Williamsville, NY. I was simply driving down the road on my way home when I saw what looked like three red candles in the sky.  I slowed down and turned off my headlights to get a better view and before I knew it my car was directly underneath the lights.  They seemed to be more independent moving than of a single object. I spooled myself fairly quickly and drove away looking back over my shoulder to see if I was in fact putting distance between myself and the lights.  While looking back I thought I saw a fourth independent light in the horizon.  They were all noiseless (at least from the car) and low enough to the ground that I lost them from my sight when enough trees were in the way.;42.9685000000015;-78.7492000000012
