It was about 11:30 p.m. at night, I was sleeping and my dog at the end of the bed by the window awoke me with a bark. He was looking outside so I decided to see what it was. At first I thought it was an airplane, but then I thought that it was much to slow to be an airplane. It was incredibly low to the ground, only 20 feet above my house. It was a giant triangle about 75 feet on each side. There was a light on each point of the triangle and mabye one in the middle but it was too faint to tell. It hovered above my house for about 20 seconds until it disappeared into the night sky. It looked like it was searching for something.

Orange-yellowish, hazy lights in the shape of a triangle.;2009-09-17 21:10:00;15 seconds;Orange-yellowish, hazy lights in the shape of a triangle. Living in the immediate area of the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport, actually in the flight path of the alternate crosswinds runway, I enjoy laying outside on many evenings watching the stars and flight paths of jets/planes.  Also do this at property in Springville, New York which is approximately 35 miles south of Buffalo. On approximately this night, my daughter and I went outside at 20:50 hours to hopefully see a satellite that the local news stations had said was to pass over the Buffalo area around 21:00 hours and be visible with the naked eye. I have always read that a visible satellite was pretty much a constant moving white light that would move across the skies. If I remember correctly, I believe the news reported that this satellite was to move from the NE to the SW or vice versa. Not positive at this point, but I believe this is what they had indicated. It was to pass over at approximately 21:05 hours. As my daughter and I waited and watched, we apparently missed seeing this or just were not looking in the correct direction. We continued to stay outside and enjoy the night sky above. At approximately 21:15 hours my daughter first noticed the following and then I did. We are not crazy and we both know what we saw. What we saw came across the night sky, curving from the NNW to the SSE. In the shape of a triangle were 3 hazy, dull, orange-yellowish colored lights moving/gliding in a quiet, peaceful motion slightly rotating on its own axis. It appeared to be only, say, a few hundred yards above us and well below the night stars in the sky. It was no aircraft, no helicopter, no weather balloon, no satellite, no military crafts, etc., etc. And funny thing is, its path of going to the SSE was basically going just west of the airport, over the Cheektowaga area. My daughter and I looked at each other in excitement and somewhat disbelief with what we both saw. We know we saw something and we are convinced it was an UFO. I for one have always believed in UFOâ€™s and been very much interested in them for years. We did not report this to the Town of Amherst Police or any other agency. There was nothing in the media outlets, papers or radio in the following days after that I am aware of. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
