At first, we were confounded as to why such an object was so high and would be flying in daylight. We then took out binoculars and discovered that all 5 of us could see the same thing and to make sure, we each went into seperate rooms and drew what we thought we had seen. In awe we discovered that we all had the same sketch. After we had finished drawing we returned outside and saw the same basic shape dart across the sky extremely high up at speeds unknown for known aircraft. We did not have the binoculars at this time and were unable to see if it was the same ufo as we had seen before. Roughly 30 minutes later we saw a helicopter at pitch black at night coming across in the same pattern the ufo had traveled. We thought this was very suspicious because helicopters rarely, if ever fly into or within 10 miles of where my house is. This my be irrelevent but is an extreme coincidence and could have been a mercy flight.;42.9685000000015;-78.7492000000012

In clear skys my daughter captured an amazing photo of a UFO On Sept 10th at 2:30 p.m. on a sunny, clear skied afternoon with very little cloud cover my daughter was sitting on the couch looking up through the skylight when she first noticed the object from far way.  She had asked her little Brother “What is that”?  As she pointed toward the object that was far away, small but approaching her Brother was too busy playing to look at the object. In a matter of seconds the object got bigger and bigger as it got closer and as it directly passed above her view in the skylight it was very large and she realized this was nothing she had ever seen before. She started yelling upstairs to my wife “What is that”?  My Wife thought the “thing” my daughter was franticly referring to was a bug and didn’t think too much of it and called from upstairs “no”. Knowing this was something out of the ordinary my Daughter then grabbed the camera off the kitchen counter ran to the front bay window and snapped a picture of the Unidentified Flying! Object.  She than became a little frightened and ran to get my Wife. She didn’t see where or how the object had left the area but when she returned a few minutes later the object was gone. My wife then looked at the picture and was amazed at what my Daughter’s picture had captured in the sky. We have included the picture she had taken from our window and we are working on sketches that we hope will show scale to help figure out the altitude, distance and size of the item. Any help you can offer in ways of an explanation would be greatly appreciated. Although we feel the picture speaks for itself!!;42.9685000000015;-78.7492000000012
