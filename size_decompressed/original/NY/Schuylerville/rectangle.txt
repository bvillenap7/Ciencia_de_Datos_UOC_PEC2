Large rectangular object w/ windows and circular lights in the sky, descending quickly;1991-07-01 23:00:00;1-2 minutes;Large rectangular object w/ windows and circular lights in the sky, descending quickly While driving on State Route 29 from Greenwich NY to Saratoga Springs NY on a summer night and at approximately 23:00 in 1991, my then girlfriend and I had just passed what was then Bullard’s Apple Orchard (now Saratoga Apple). Suddenly 3/4 of our visible sky was what appeared to be a rectangular object with several windows and several circular white lights. The lights were constant, not strobing or flickering. The object appeared to be descending quickly. It was silent. No noticeable wind or environmental disturbances but there was a noticeable energy / current. I couldn’t drive. I stopped. I wanted to get out of my car but couldn’t. My girlfriend immediately began sobbing. I immediately had flashbacks (very vivid) of my childhood sexual abuse that I had suppressed as a child. The object was present for maybe a minute or two. I was a part time police officer then. My girlfriend’s father was a Sgt w/ the New York State Police at that time. Upon getting to he! r house in Saratoga we immediately told her father. He used every available LE resource and contact he had in an attempt to find a reasonable cause but no logical explanation was found. The event was life defining for me. Also, I feel that we were incredibly close to the object.;43.0911;-73.6039
