Erratic low flying silent single orange light.;2015-07-05 21:30:00;2 minutes;Erradic low flying silent single orange light. This was a large orange light moving erradically from the west before moving to the east/northeast. It looked like it wasn't very high in the air and it was silent.  It almost looked as if it was aflame.  I watched it for about 2 minutes before it disappeared.;43.0911;-73.6039
