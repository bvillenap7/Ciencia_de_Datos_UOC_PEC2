Two oval-shaped craft over the river in Bismarck.  ((anonymous report));2018-06-10 01:37:00;~5 minutes;Two oval-shaped craft over the river in Bismarck Two oval shaped brightly lit craft passed very low over the river, low enough to create a wake in the water below.  There was a loud and low hum which grew in intensity as the craft went along the water way before turning sharply upwards at an almost 90 degree angle.  They went up pretty high and sort of hovered for around 30 seconds before vanishing entirely. Lots of dogs barking until they disappeared.  My fiancee and a couple we were entertaining all witnessed this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact  information.  PD));46.8098275720165;-100.774545267489
