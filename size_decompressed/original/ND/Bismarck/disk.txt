silver disc shaped object flying extremely fast at a low altitude;2009-04-11 11:20:00;3 seconds;silver disc shaped object flying extremely fast at a low altitude I was having breakfast with my wife at a local restaurant.  Our table was located right next to a large picture window, facing North at the end of Main Street.   As I looked out, I noticed a small Cessna airplane flying slowly on its final approach to the Bismarck airport.  Just as I was losing sight of the Cessna, I looked back to my right and spotted a silver metallic object flying extremely fast in a straight line from East to West.   The object appeared to be disk shaped, similar to a double-convex lens if looked at from a side view.  The object was approximately 1/4 mile to the North and appeared to be flying at a lower altitude than the Cessna had been, I estimate about 300 to 400 feet above ground level.  I believe the airplane would have been moving at about 80 knots, therefore, I would estimate the disk shaped object was moving at between 500 and 700 mph, as I lost sight of it within 2-3 seconds.   The object appeared to be a little smaller than the airplane, approximately 18 feet in diameter. I am an amateur radio operator and trained weather spotter.  I have taken fixed wing flying lessons and have built and flown R.C. model aircraft for many years.  I am familiar with most types of aircraft and I have seen anything in the sky like this before.
