On Sept 29th 2011 I was in my backyard just thinking and pacing around, while I spend my time outside I often look at the stars.  While I was looking up this time (I was looking west) I saw 3 dim yellow dots (they looked like average stars) in the form of a slight obtuse triangle.  They were not blinking like strobe lights, they were solid dim lights.  These dots were in perfect form flying the exact same speed (which was about 3x as fast as airliners usually fly).  They flew NW until I could no longer see them due to trees and houses.  The whole encounter lasted 8-10 seconds and had heard no sounds of jets or planes, all was silent.;46.8098275720165;-100.774545267489
~7 Orange lights in a triangular formation moving silently across the entire sky in about 4 seconds before disappearing into the night.;2012-04-25 23:30:00;5 Seconds;~7 Orange lights in a triangular formation moving silently across the entire sky in about 4 seconds before disappearing into the night. As I was Star gazing, I saw a light which turned out to be about 6 or 7 Orange lights in a large triangular formation moving swiftly across the sky from East to West,  Shortly after the object appeared in the eastern sky it disappeared toward the west.  The craft made no noise and it seemed a lot larger and a lot faster than any aircraft I am familiar with. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
