Nat. Weather Serv. empl. sees a small, circular, distinctly flame-orange obj. in the S sky.  Brighter & larger than brightest star.;1996-11-24 18:07:00;60 sec.;A meteorologist for the National Weather Service called to enquire whether there had been any other reports about a burning orange light in the southern sky.  It was about 65-75 degrees above the horizontal plane, and he wondered whether it could have been the space shuttle.  It appeared between broken clouds.  It was brighter and larger than a bright star, and smaller than the moon.  He said that if a person had seen it, he could not have missed it or mistaken it for a naturally occuring object. Its color looked like the orange (?) swirling flames that come out of the space shuttle when it takes off.  He added that he was looking through broken clouds that were drifting, but he had the distinct impression that the object was moving.  I;46.8098275720165;-100.774545267489
A small light slightly bigger than the surrounding stars darting to and fro for about ten minutes.;2000-07-01 02:30:00;10 min.;A small light slightly bigger than the surrounding stars darting to and fro for about ten minutes. I stepped out of the garage about 2:30 in the morning to have a smoke.  As I always do, I looked skyward to see what could be seen.  I spotted a light slightly bigger than the surrounding stars darting back and forth...moving to the left, hovering, then moving to the right.  It would hover there, than move to the left again.  Rather than a straight to and fro motion, it's path had kind of a circular jog at 9am and 3pm.  It was like it was circling around in a very tight arc instead of going in reverse, if this makes sense. It repeated this pattern over and over again the whole time I was watching it.  It was not exactly regular though, the time it hovered at opposite poles varied slightly.   As I recall, the light was comprised of three smaller lights, red white and green side by side, perhaps slightly triangular.  It randomly glittered but was not blinking.  It didn't seem to always return to the same place...it would dart rather quickly to it's next position, seem to hesitate momentarily, then move back again.  Because of it's dimunitive size, it was hard to gauge it's distance.  I could think of no earthly object or reason for this manifestation.  I finally became cold and went indoors.  I went back outdoors several times in the next hour to see if it was still there, and it was.  I finally fell asleep around 4am and that was the last I know of it.  Not very spectacular, but that's the way it happened.  The thing that most stands out in my mind is that I could think of no rational reason for this to be occuring in the middle of the night in the middle of North Dakota.  I did look for it several nights afterwards and did not spot it.;46.8098275720165;-100.774545267489
green spotlight and 3 lights;2010-06-04 22:00:00;30 min;green spotlight and 3 lights Driving south on Hwy 83, we were north of Bismarck.  Sky had just gone dark, so the sky was slightly light.  There was a skinny storm cloud stretching across the sky- you could see the whole perimeter of it.   I was watching it closely because the tail end appeared to be trying to drop a funnel cloud.  Then I saw green light shining down.  I thought it had to be some strange lightening, but there was no other lightening in the sky.  It was shining through a spot in the clouds exactly like a spot light.  It was clearly very green in color.  We tried to capture it on cell phone camera, but it would not show up.  When we watched the video the screen flashed white a couple times. That was probably about ten miles north of Bismarck on hw 83. On approach to Bismarck we saw three amber/orange/red colored lights above town.  They would move around independently.  I thought they moved like a fly.  Sometimes they would sort of fade away...then light up again on a different end of town.  They were more difficult to see from in town, but we still saw them and again tried to take a video, but the phone would not go onto video mode. People were obviously looking at the lights from their vehicles too. I would really like to know what this is about.  I searched the internet for reports of it, and found this website.;46.8098275720165;-100.774545267489
Light moving from SSW to NNE over Bismarck;2013-08-05 23:15:00;3 minutes;Light moving from SSW to NNE over Bismarck I stepped out onto my deck about 11:15 at night when I noticed what I thought was a bright star.  As I watched it I noticed it was moving in a north north easterly direction. It was a bright white and moved pretty rapidly, crossing to the east of my house and out of site within 2 or 3 minutes.  It seemed to have a dull red glow at the back end and kind of looked like it was moving side to side a little as it was moving.  I didn’t see any flashing lights at all and didn’t notice any sound, but the neighbors central air was running so if it was quiet I wouldn’t have heard it.;46.8098275720165;-100.774545267489
Bright light traveling east turned south and then appeared to remain motionless for no less than a minute before disappearing.;2015-08-13 22:30:00;2 minutes;Bright light traveling east turned south and then appeared to remain motionless for no less than a minute before disappearing. My son and I where having a fire.  We live on the edge of town and noticed what at first site appeared to be a bright airplane flying at cruising altitude.  This bright light was Northwest of our location when first sighted and traveling east.   The light then began to make a relatively sharp turn to the South.  The brightness of the object as well as the turn it was making was enough to capture my focused attention.  The light turned South and then stopped, when the object stopped it was South East of our location.   The object appeared to remain motionless for at least a minute.  The brightness of the object did not seem to substantially change from the moment it was spotted until it was last seen.  It did seem to pulsate but the relative brightness remained the same as far as I could tell from when it was NW of our location to SE and appearing motionless.   I regret to say, I looked away at the fire for about 5-10 seconds, if that, and my son exclaimed, It's Gone!.   I looked up in disbelief, since I was just looking at it and it was so bright, and it was gone no sign of it whatsoever.;46.8098275720165;-100.774545267489
