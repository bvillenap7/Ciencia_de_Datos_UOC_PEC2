5 white lights in formation;1996-10-11 16:00:00;6;5 white lights in formation Rough date- Definately a Friday or Saturday night in October of 1996.   While overlooking the Missouri river from the north side of Bismarck in a stagard V formation, 5 lights (not sure if one object or 5 objects) were noticed in the north sky and completely crossed the sky in 6 seconds.   Other witness saw it first and say that it was redish for a split second but all 6 seconds I observed it they were white lights.   No trails behind lights and no sound.   Amazingly fast but could never have been satellites or shooting star. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));46.8098275720165;-100.774545267489
October 1996 V-shaped formation of craft at exceptional high speed over Bismarck;1996-10-11 22:00:00;6 seconds;October 1996 V-shaped formation of craft at exceptional high speed over Bismarck North Bismarck over looking the Missouri River looking to Mandan “skyline” lights at night. May have happened the following Friday October 18, 1996.  Formation of 5 or 7 white lights were seen  due north at first, traveled straight overhead and were out of view to the south within 4 or 5 seconds.  The object OR objects made no sound and completely crossed the sky faster than any known aircraft known then or now at the time of this report in 2020.  This Formation appeared almost like very very bright satellites but moved far too fast. They left no trail of light as a meteor could.  We’re in perfect v formation. If this craft was closer to the ground than appeared it produced no sound.  Formation traveled faster and further than any known craft then or now without sound.  Witnessed by two people at same time.;46.8098275720165;-100.774545267489

Flashing Stationary Object for 18 minutes over the Western skyline;2015-09-18 22:47:00;18 minutes;Flashing Stationary Object for 18 minutes over the Western skyline A light in the sky over the WNW not far above city horizon, but it looked far away.  Light was at least twice the size of a large star. Was flashing white, yellow and briefly other colors, and not at any patterned intervals. Had light arms off of it toward the north that were also flashing.  Did not move from its position for 18 minutes.  Did not come closer, get farther away, or move side to side.  Just was flashing. Called someone on the other side of town to look at it.  They initially thought it was a helicopter, but then looked through binoculars and said “it’s not a helicopter, it looks like fire, looks like it’s moving through binoculars, but not when I look without them”. We both agreed that we had never seen anything like this in our lives, which equal collectively, about 85 years. When I went in to get my long range lens, and came back outside, it was gone. There were two planes on the other side of the sky briefly at the beginning of this, and they looked much smaller.  Nothing on the news yet about what this is. We are both very practical, scientific, analytical people, and this was very weird.  I am very curious to know what this was.
