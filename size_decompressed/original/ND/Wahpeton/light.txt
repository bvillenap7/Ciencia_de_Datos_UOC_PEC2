Came down quickly but then moved about slowly... I was outside with my dog and noticed random lights scattered around the sky that had a similar appearance as the stars.  Yet, the look of them seemed off some how.  While looking at them, one started to appear like it waz coming down out of the sky directly at me.  It came down close enough at me, I was able to record video of it until it moved off and I lost sight of it behind some trees.  It was a mostly circular light (had some slight variations in shape) with some slight color changes to it.  It is a similar type light used on some of the drones I see out.  Lots of suspicious drone activity around here.  And, now even more suspicious that some of the drones (if thats what every flying object I see is?  As I also saw a larger triangle shaped flying object few weeks later) have lighting that appears similar to these light orbs.  After recording the light orb, I immediately started showing my video to other people... some of whom told me they had seen similar light orbs elsewhere.  I want to know what these light orbs are, why some of the drones are using lights similar to these light orbs and why the orbs and some drone lights look similar to the stars in the sky?  This, in addition to the fake looking clouds and weird sunsets etc, I have been seeing.  I have tried getting answers through people at local airport, geo-engineer staff, city workers... and just get different answers from everyone....which tells me someone is lying or noone seems to know what is happening.  Went to the radio station as well.  Also, since I show people my video. and pics, I am having more people approach me to share stories about light orbs they are seeing... and all within past few months... aaahh.  Anywho, I am nearing 40, have multiple college degrees, have always enjoyed observing sky... grew up in Montana, aka the Big Sky State.  And, have noticed different looks to the sunsets, clouds, and color variations in the sky here... not sure what up. Thank you for your time and this site. P.S. i would email you my video of the light orb yet data size obstructs me from doing so, az i have tried sending to other people...if you know way that works, would gladly do.  Thanks!;46.3692428571428;-96.7225178571428
