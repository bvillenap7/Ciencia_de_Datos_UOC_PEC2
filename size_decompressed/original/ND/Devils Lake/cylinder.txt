Photograph of rod or cylinder shaped object;2010-07-13 13:00:00;75 seconds;Photograph of rod or cylinder shaped object At approximately 13:00 on July 13, 2010, I took a photograph in the vicinity of Lake Lumber in Devils Lake, North Dakota.  I took the photograph because of an unusual looking cloud but at that time did not see an unknown object. When I had the film developed I was surprised to see a rod or cylinder shaped object in the picture.    There was also an object that I believe to be an f-16 fighter in the distance on an eastern tangent from my location. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
