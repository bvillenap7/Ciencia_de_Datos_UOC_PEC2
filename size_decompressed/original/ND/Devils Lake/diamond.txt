There was  one small white light on each corner, that would flash simultaneously every 3/4 of a second. I was only able to see the lights no outline of the craft. The craft was at a very high altitude such as a comercial airplane. The object was moving in the same direction as us at a fast pace, ahead of our truck on the right side of the road. The craft began to move across the sky over to the left side over the road at a very fast pace such as a military jet, except it didn't move like any plane i knew, instead of flying in a straight line it moved in a stagnant criss-cross action that was differnt everytime, every time the light blinked off it was in a diffrent position either a little above or a little below the normal line of flight. After about a minute of flashing and moving on the left side it proceded back across to the right side of the road in the same stagnant unpredictable pattern. After about another minute of chasing it was getting to far to see and was soon gone, but not before we stopped the car and got out of the car making sure it wasn't just some bizarre glare off the windshield. My friend and I witnessed this event for about five minutes;48.1127;-98.8676
