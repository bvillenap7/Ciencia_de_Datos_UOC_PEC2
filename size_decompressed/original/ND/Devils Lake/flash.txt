It was not like any shooting star i have ever seen the object appeared to go up rather than down.  The part that was so cool about it is that it left a blue tracer that stayed lit up for about 5 secs.  It kind of reminded me of a light saber that was blue.  I watch the sky every chance i get for years now and never had seen anything like it.  I was alone however phoned my ex girlfriend and she answered you will not believe what i had just saw.  Her and a friend of her saw the same thing that i did.  Sorry no spell check.;48.1127;-98.8676
