I was coming home from a party that had lasted quite late, and I must admit I was a little intoxicated. However, there is no mistaking what I saw that night. A huge, completly silent, fiery ball of light silently hovered over head as I drove buy. Me, and another car behind me(I apologize for I never asked for his name) stopped and gawked for a few moments at this beautiful sight. It hovered silently for roughly five seconds, then, without warning, the ball suddenly zipped off into the night sky. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed in my life. Feel free to give me a call to talk about the experience.;48.2544435754189;-101.301189944134
Green fireball near Minot, ND;2004-11-09 06:20:00;5 seconds;Green fireball near Minot, ND I was driving on Highway 83 North to Minot, ND where I work.  As I was driving I thought I had seen a shooting star out of the corner of my eye.  I turned to look but it was a big green fireball moving East.  It appeared to be arcing downward and the green light had burnt out.  But yet I could still see an object falling.  While I was driving there were about five other cars around me and they all had to have seen because they all slammed on their brakes when it occured. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
