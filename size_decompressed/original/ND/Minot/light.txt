I saw what looked like airplane lights moving from east to west (facing south), except the light traveled half way across the sky in ~2 seconds and then vanished.  About one month ago, I witnessed this same event and had convinced myself that I was seeing things.  But tonight (I smoke outside which is why I am outside a lot), I know what I saw.  The first time it happened - one month ago, the only difference was the light traveled from west to east (facing south). I am anxious now to know whether anyone else saw this.
