Large rectangular object hovering over Minot Air Base, ND.;1979-06-01 00:00:00;3-4 mins;Large rectangular object hovering over Minot Air Base, ND.  I was age 5 or 6 so the details are a little fuzzy.  Woke up around midnight to use the bathroom and upon my return saw a huge rectangular object floating in the sky through the bedroom window.  Object was roughly the size of an aircraft carrier.  Mostly rectangular in shape although with other angular features.  Lights were scattered about the surface of the craft although I don't remember any specific colors.  Here's the kicker - after viewing the object for a minute a pair of doors opened on the craft.  Doors retracted into the top and bottom of a rectangular space in the craft.  The doors were much more wide than tall.  A second craft emerged from the rectangular space, moved away from the first craft, angled slightly and moved out of sight.  I only remember the second craft was disc shaped, I don't remember the color or if it had lights.  The doors from the first craft closed and it remained hovering in place.  No sounds were emitted from either craft.  After watching this unfold over 3-4 minutes I went back to sleep thinking this is too unbelieveable to be real.  However I did pinch and shake myself to make sure I was really awake.  Told parents about my sighting the next day and a base policeman stopped by to file a report.  The policeman dismissed my sighting as a kid having a dream.  It was all too real for me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));48.2544435754189;-101.301189944134
