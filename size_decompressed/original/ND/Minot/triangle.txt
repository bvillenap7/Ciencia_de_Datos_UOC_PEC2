I was the first to notice the unidentified flying object above us. I was resting on the ground after a big dinner, looking upward at the stars. I said to my wife, Hey look at that!! There is a UFO flying above us. She immediately looked up at where I was pointing. Our nephew jumps out of the backseat of the van and saw the same thing we were witnessing. It flew over us going slow like it was a gladder or something that goes that slow. It didn’t have any flashing lights or make any sounds. It did have mirrors or something that reflected the lights of the city on the bottom of it. It went behind some tree and the sighting was over in about 20 seconds. We all agreed that we had seen the same thing. That was the first time my or the nephew had ever seen any thing like before in their life time;48.2544435754189;-101.301189944134
Obj. with 6 lights,triangular in shape with a tail, moved from the S area in the sky to the N and then just hovered.;2008-10-19 01:00:00;2 Hours;Object with six lights,triangular in shape with a tail, moved from the South area in the sky to the North and then just hovered. Hello, my name is ((name deleted)) and I am a member of the ((deleted/military)).   I believe I saw a UFO in Minot ND, early Sunday Morning, 19 Oct, at about 1am.   I was standing with a friend outside a meeting house when she noticed, then I saw, a figure, which looked like a Triangle with a Tail.  It was pretty far up, but differed from the surrounding stars.  It was moving from South, towards North.       I tried to call the Minot Airport Tower, but no answer.  When observed with binoculars, the object arrayed its lights as blurred, while the stars surrounding were bright and cleared.   While we were watching this object, a USAF Jet flew under it and left a Chem. Trail.   Also, we observed at least five shooting stars through the 2 hours of observing this object.   I tried to take a picture with a digital camera, but it didn’t show up on film.  Have there been sightings of UFO’s that are Triangular, with a tail?;48.2544435754189;-101.301189944134
3 orbs in triangle shape passed over an airplane, headed NW across Minot, ND.;2009-08-13 23:00:00;5 seconds;3 orbs in triangle shape passed over an airplane, headed NW across Minot, ND. My wife and I were having dinner, and I decided to finish the night with a drink and a smoke. I went out side and looked at the stars to see meteor shower that were supposed to be visable tonight (last night 12Aug09 I saw 6 of them). I was laying down and noticed an airplane flying across the sky (to the point were the red and blue flashing lights were completely visable from the two side (wing) lights. Around 23:00 3 orbs traveling together like a triangle passed over the sky headed NW. The triangle of orbs passed over an airplane traveling the same speed and keeping the same distance. The orbs (each) were 3 times bigger than a commercial airline (like the wings and the under light mesh togeather) at high to maximum altitude. I rushed downstairs and told my wife and upstairs roomates what I saw. Not more than 5 minutes later we spotted a satilite traveling the same orbit that the 3 lights were headed the same direction.;48.2544435754189;-101.301189944134
A triangular shaped group of approximately 20 intensely bright lights appear and disappear.;2014-05-23 01:30:00;3-5 seconds;A triangular shaped group of approximately 20 intensely bright lights appear and disappear. I and my wife were on our back deck to observe a meteor shower.  While looking up, a triangular shape group of approximately 20 intensely bright oval lights appeared heading east to west at a rapid speed at about a 100 foot height.   As we got to our feet for further observation, the lights vanished.   The object at its widest point was about 75 feet and 75 feet long.   The lights were spaced evenly throughout the entire object, not just along the perimeter.;48.2544435754189;-101.301189944134
