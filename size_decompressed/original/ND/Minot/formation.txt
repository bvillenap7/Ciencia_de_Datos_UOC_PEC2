Fleet of unknown fast moving bright objects.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-22 03:20:00;5 minutes;Fleet of unknown fast moving bright objects Went out this morning to look for meteors and wait for the 4:12 am Passover of Starlink. From the south shot roughly a dozen fast moving objects.  They were white and bright but moving too fast to make out anything other then an orb shape.  Lower then a satellite or plane. The 1st group had two.  The 2nd following had 3. The 3rd group was two. The 4th group had three and the final group appeared to have 4. They all were closely grouped back to back. Moving far too fast to be birds. The final grouping evaporated in this air. Iâ€™ve been watching for meteors in the skies here for over 22 years. These were not meteor as they were not high enough.  They sped up, slowed down and sped back up before disappearing. I observed several satellites, 2 airplanes, two geese flying from north to south,  a few atmospheric flashes that I presume were meteors and I counted 15 Starlinks before I stopped and went inside. The other objects are a mystery to me.;48.2544435754189;-101.301189944134
