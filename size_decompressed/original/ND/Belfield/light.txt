lights moving in perfect formation together.;1997-07-17 23:00:00;15 minutes;lights moving in perfect formation together. My friend and I were by the little dam south of town,and we were star watching. WE noticed a bright light to the west,it seemed brighter than a star so we kept looking at it then it seemed to drop suddenly lower, then it moved, but it was so fast that we didn't know where it went, we looked to the east and it was there,then it looked like there was another light next to it and that one moved to the south, then another one apeared and movede to the north, then another to the west. It made a perfect diamond shape in the sky, then all four lights, switched positions at different times, (ex: the west light moved to east and east to west and so on and this took place for about 5 or 6 minutes,the movement of the lights was blink of an eye fast. then I called the city police officer with my cell phone, and he came out to check it out, and I asked him what it was and he said he had never seen something like that before, but a farmer north of town had reported lights to him about a week before that. the whole episode went on for about 15-20 minutes then they just disappeared.
