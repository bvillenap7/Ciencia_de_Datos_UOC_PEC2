It appeared like a normal bright evening star until it started to waver!  I stopped my car to look at it.  It then divided into 3 or 4 lights ( I can't remember) They flew uniform distance apart.  I kept looking for blinking lights, as an aircraft would have, but saw none.  The three or four lights were not as bright as the original one star I first saw.  They were more of an even glow, no real color that I recollect.   I heard no sound. They appeared to be flying closer and closer towards the earth until they turned and flew to the north and then they just disappeared.  They seemed to be flying extremely fast.  Distance is so hard to judge with light, so I have no idea how far away they were. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in September 2000 is approximate.  PD));46.821;-103.1293
