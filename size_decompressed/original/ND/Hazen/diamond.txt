This sighting occurred on 8/11/13, at approximately 2330 Hrs, while viewing the Perseids meteor shower.  My son and I were watching the night sky, and suddenly a diamond shaped object appeared, traveling from a south to north trajectory.  As it passed by the Milky Way Galaxy, it blocked out the stars as it flew by.  The diamond shaped object had a charcoal gray color to it and on all four corners, it had dim white solid lights.  Its speed was very fast, as we were able to observe it for about only 7 seconds.   The object was silent, and the size, at best guess, was if you held out your thumb out at arms length, it would cover it.  So it was very large in size.   About two minutes later, a commercial jet liner came into view, traveling west to east, but the speed was nowhere even close to what we witnessed.  The sky was clear, no moon, no wind.  The speed it was moving, it would be very difficult to photograph.    Thank you for your interest in this subject.  Hopefully ! soon this mystery can be known.;47.3243;-101.6181
