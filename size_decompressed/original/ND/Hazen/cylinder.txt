Big and huge and very silent ,with dim lights all around it;2008-08-07 23:00:00;10 seconds;Big and huge and very silent ,with dim lights all around it We were on our deck on the east side of our house and these lights came into view and at the tip of the craft was one single light and then as it got closer I could see the out line of the craft made the front of it a triangle and as it passed over ,I got a real good look at the size of this thing.I gave a shout to my wife and her friend that they needed to look up and check this out and they jumped up and we all watched it pass over ,very silent and very huge,it didn't make a sound and the lights were dim ,kind of like they were coming from the inside of the craft,like it had see through windows on the side of it,about six of then down the side and then the end of it was the same shape as the front ,with a light at the point. I would say the craft was at about 1000 feet up and moving at over 100 MPH,I can not tell you if it was square or round ,but I did get a good look at the width and length and it was huge,and very silent.I did not have time to get to my digital camera and that sucks.I did report this to the Mercer county Sherifs office and made contact with the local city police today and they said nobody else called in with the sighting.
