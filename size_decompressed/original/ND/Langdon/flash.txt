An orange, glowing shape followed me in my pickup causing it to die and interfered with my phone outside of Langdon, North Dakota.;2008-11-14 21:00:00;5 minutes;An orange, glowing shape followed me in my pickup causing it to die and interfered with my phone outside of Langdon, North Dakota. I was driving back from my farm on November 14 2008 at about 9:45 p.m. and it was dark and I was driving and I got a weird feeling in my stomach and my pickup started to act up like it was dying then it would work fine again but I was by a patch of trees and all around me is just fields an that patch of trees, so I was coming around this curve and I seen a orange blurry glow in the field so I thought some farmers were just burning fields cause I seen a mist so I thought that was the smoke but then when I got around the curve there was no mist or fog so I was like that’s kind of weird then my pickup started to die an my phone was blinking and lighting up randomly and I was like whatever so as I was driving I looked behind me and there it was the orange glow hovering above the ground eye level with me behind my pickup and it would make a wooooom wooooom noise and every time it did that my pickup would want to die so at that point I knew it was a ufo and I was freaking out so I kept driving as fast as I could go then I looked behind me and it wasn’t there then when I looked forward again it was like boom right in front of me so I hit the brakes then it flashed really bright then it was gone but then when it flashed my pickup died so I sat there panicking so I called my dad but it took me a while to get a hold of him cause my phone was making a ticking sound but then I got a hold of him after 4 tries so my dad towed my pickup to a nearby farm and we drove back to town and I didn’t sleep at all that night but then a couple nights later I woke up sitting on the edge of my bed looking straight out my window and I realized what the heck am I doing so then I fell back to sleep so I don’t know if they were trying to contact me some way through my sleep. an that’s it. I’m telling the truth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
