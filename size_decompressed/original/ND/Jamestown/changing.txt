Dear peter,     I remember talking to you the night that I reported this, you had just been on Coast to Coast I think a night or two before.  This is the first time I've checked out your website and I'd like to thank you for the wonderful job you are doing here.  Unfortunately I noticed an error. the report is copied below: Occurred : 2/26/1997 07:00 (Entered as : 6:30 - 7:30) Reported : 1/2/1997 01:03 Posted : 3/7/1998 Location : Jamestown, ND Shape : Changing  SUMMARY: The object was around the size of a small car it changed shape and light color and pattern as it moved. it was silent. 15-20mph 1 object that was moving between 15-20mph andfrom 10 to 80 yards off the ground.

If you notice, it says that the event occurred on 2-26-97 and was reported on 1-2-97,  now if that were true it would be almost as fantastic as what I saw!!  :) In actually the event itself occured on 1-1-97.  Please check your records and make the appropriate changes.   Thanks again for all your work. If you need verification of my identity just reply my e-mail and I will be happy to provide any info you need. Thank you, ((signature deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date corrected.  PD));46.9208;-98.745
