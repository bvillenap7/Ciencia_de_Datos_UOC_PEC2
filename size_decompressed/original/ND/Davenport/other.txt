Family of 5 saw many questionable shooting stars going in all directions north to south, south to north, east to south, west to east, lost track after 17.  At least 3 of said objects had comet like tails.   One light northeast of us did a u-turn.   We also saw 4 distant objects that hovered then would cross the sky at such an amazing speed, that best described by our eldest teen bested the Blue Angels, and disappear among the stars.   One of the comet-tailed light seen appeared to be 3 lights clustered.   After 75 minutes we realized our 9 year old was no longer comfortable and quite overwhelmed, and had to stop so not certain the activity stopped.;46.6968;-97.0871
