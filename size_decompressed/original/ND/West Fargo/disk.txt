Orange orb travels across night sky.;2015-06-13 01:00:00;1 minute;Orange orb travels across night sky. I want to report because my friend and I have never seen a flying object like this. We saw an orange orb that looked nothing like a plane.   We watched as it almost looked on fire but seemed to travel fairly fast along the night sky.   The object was somewhat high in the sky but a recognizable shape and color absolutely.   We could not explain what we saw and phone camera quality was not able to capture the phenomena.;46.8907;-96.9258
