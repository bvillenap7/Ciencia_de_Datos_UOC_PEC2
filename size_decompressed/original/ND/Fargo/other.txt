A brief background of myself, i am 36 years old. and have livein fargo most of my life. all except for the time i spent in the air force. from 1983 to 1992. my friend that was with me is 30 years old and has been a close friend for the last five years. on the day of the sighting we were walking outside when i looked up and noticed an airplane flying at high altitude leaving a short contrail behind it. it was high enough so that i really couldnt see the plane but knew it was there because of the contrail. directly behind the plane at a close distance, im not sure how close, it was hard to judge because of the high altitude but i would say within two miles. i saw a single object. i knew it had to be much larger than the airplane since i could see the shape and color. it was very long and         skinny. almost pencile like. and very light in color. i would say like a white light. it stayed at a constant distance behind the plane for most of the time i was  watching.  but at the end of the sighting , the plane kept going in the same straight direction and the object turned more upward at about a 45  degree angle and seemed to speed up rapidly only to dissapere in the distance.the interesting thing to me about the object was that it left no contrail whatsoever. which confirmed for me that it wasnt just one plane following another.;46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
2 luminescent glowing forms criss-crossing across the night sky.;2009-05-17 04:05:00;15 seconds;2 luminescent glowing forms criss-crossing across the night sky. 2 glowing shapes flying across the sky at super speed, but very low to the ground.  It wasn't lights but more of a luminescent glow that was very dim.  There was nothing flashing, no blinking lights, just the 2 glows.  I couldn't really tell any shapes of a spacecraft, only the glow.  They were going very close to the ground, maybe 30-50 feet up.  As they passed above me, they crossed each other like they were swapping places...right glow to the left, left glow to the right, and just speed off across the sky.  They were absolutly silent as I remember hearing nothing but the grass crunching under my feet as I stared at them in awe.  I've seen hundreds of airplanes cross the sky where I was, and have never seen anything that you couldn't tell was a plane by the blinking colored lights and visual shape of the plane.  Not to mention it was far to close to the ground.;46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
