At first we thought it was an airplane but as it approached we noticed it had no lights (green and red on the wings).  As it flew over our house we it emitted four points of light out of the front.  The lights extended out in front of the object and came to a distinct end at which point the light became very focused.  These were on for approximately 3-5 seconds.  They turned off as the object continued heading north.  The object was a bright orange and had very fuzzy edges.  Object was much brighter than the ISS and other orbiting objects and was easily the same brightness of Venus in the winter sky. Father is 42 - Son is 8. We are avid aviation fans and have studied many aircraft over the years.;46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
