Update on bright flare...;2006-08-19 05:13:00;15-20 seconds;Update on bright flare... Update: I did a bit of internet sleuthing after reporting the bright flash in the sky I witnessed the other morning. Apparently what I saw was the Iridium 54 satellite, which was scheduled to be over my location here in Fargo, ND at 05:12:09 on the date I had my sighting - Saturday, 19 August 2006. As I mentioned in my initial report, the flash of light I saw was almost alarmingly bright, and the chart I found on the website pegged Iridium 54 at a brightness magnitude of -7 on the logarithmic scale that measures light intensity. I'm assuming that the bright flare I saw a week or two back was the same object.;46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
