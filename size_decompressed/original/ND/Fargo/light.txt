Very bright object flares even brighter.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting or Iridium 54.  PD));2006-08-19 05:11:00;15-20 seconds;Very bright object flares even brighter. I arrived home from work early this morning, and as is my habit looked up at the sky after exiting my vehicle. I love to look at the night sky, and this morning the sky was unusually clear and crisp.  The *dark* side of the moon reflecting the bounce light of the earth was plainly evident - an astronomical phenomenon that until recent years was fairly rare, even here in the relatively unsullied skies of North Dakota - but now for some reason it is a very common sight. (Something very odd going on in that department!)  Anyway, almost as soon as I looked up and almost directly overhead, I saw what I at first thought was a very bright planet - until, that is, I realized it was moving quite slowly on a roughly north to south trajectory. And very quickly after that realization the object swiftly flared brighter and brighter until I became rather alarmed - I would estimate its lumens quadrupled - and then suddenly its intensity dropped off as though somebody had thrown a switch, but it was actually still faintly visible via peripheral vision.  In other words to still see it after it flared out, I had to look slightly to the side of its trajectory.  I'm thinking it was a satellite of some sort reflecting the predawn sun as it rolled in orbit - it seemed to be at satellite height - but at the same time it seemed to move too slowly to fall into that category.  The brightness of the object when it flared was astonishing.  This is the second time I've seen this object (or something similar) flaring overhead. About two weeks ago, I witnessed pretty much the same event, only I believe it was a couple hours earlier in the am, and both times the event occured almost as soon as I'd looked up into the sky! Talk about coincidence… ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting or Iridium 54.

Update: I did a bit of internet sleuthing after reporting the bright flash in the sky I witnessed the other morning. Apparently what I saw was the Iridium 54 satellite, which was scheduled to be over my location here in Fargo, ND at 05:12:09 on the date I had my sighting - Saturday, 19 August 2006. As I mentioned in my initial report, the flash of light I saw was almost alarmingly bright, and the chart I found on the website pegged Iridium 54 at a brightness magnitude of -7 on the logarithmic scale that measures light intensity. I'm assuming that the bright flare I saw a week or two back was the same object. ((END));46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
A very bright light just appeared and did a semi-circular swoop and disappeared into the distance.;2011-08-06 22:50:00;3 seconds;A very bright light just appeared and did a semi-circular swoop and disappeared into the distance. I'm a 27 year old woman and have never seen anything like this before.   My boyfriend is interested in UFOs and after telling him what I saw he told me to file a report.  I initially thought it wasn't a big deal and that there must be a logical explanation... because people like me don't see UFOs.   So here goes:  A bright oval light appeared out of nowhere in the sky in front of me as I was driving in the city of Fargo.  It just seemed to appear in the sky in front of me like a 1/4 mile in the distance.    It appeared and then did a semi-circular swoop and zoomed off in the matter of second or two and disappeared into the distance.   It was a circular light that was at least 4X brighter than the brightest star you typically see in the sky.

Light in the sky swiftly stopped then slowly crept out of sight.;2019-07-28 01:30:00;15 minutes;Light in the sky swiftly stopped then slowly crept out of sight. A few nights ago I got up to let my dogs out.  While waiting for them to do their business, I noticed what I thought was a plane flying swiftly through the sky.  Its direction seemed to be heading north-west.  But then, all of a sudden, it stopped.  As you can see in the video it appeared to be hovering slightly westward.;46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
Multiple lights flying across the night sky.  ((Spacelink satellites));2020-03-07 20:30:00;15 minutes;Multiple lights flying across the night sky. My son & I were outside by my garage when I happen to look up and noticed a light that I thought was from a satellite traveling from the South West going to the North East. When I pointed it out to my son, he then said that there were a few more lights traveling along the same orbital path. But as we watched the lights, we noticed that there were even more lights flying across the sky. It took the lights about 12 seconds to fly across the sky from where they appeared to where they disappeared. In all we counted 27 lights traveling across the sky.;46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
Bright Red light spotted over interstate.;2020-06-01 00:30:00;30 seconds;Bright Red light spotted over interstate. Early in the morning of June 1st, 2020 I was laying in bed when I looked out my window and through a break in the trees I saw a red light that one would see on top of a radio tower.  It had to be over I-29 or even I-94, but it was up about the cruising altitude of a commercial jet that people would take to travel. Anyway, I was laying there and I saw this beacon light almost, but knowing the area there's no tower that I can see from my bedroom window.  It was a bright red light and it hovered in the sky for approximately 30 seconds and then gradually increased speed from a dead stop within one to two seconds, shooting off to the south west.  I'd never seen anything like this in my life and it scared me.;46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
