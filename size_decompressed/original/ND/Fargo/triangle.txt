Glowing triangular object, composed of smaller triangles, floated silently across sky from NE to SW.;1978-07-15 23:00:00;1 minute;Glowing triangular object, composed of smaller triangles, floated silently across sky from NE to SW. Summer night in Fargo, ND. Wind unusually calm. Cloudless sky. Year was approximately 1978. Sitting alone on the deck about 11 pm, I saw A triangular-shaped glowing object, composed of smaller triangles, floated silently from NE to SW over the roof of my house. It went in the direction of the triangle's point. I ran to the SE corner of the house to see it emerge from the other side of the house but did not see it again. Could not tell how high it was if it was within 50 yards of the roof, it was about 30-50 feet long if it was higher, it was much bigger. My background: college graduate, never have done any drugs, never smoked anything, very light drinker. Always have been interested in aviation/ aerospace. At the time I was in my mid 30s with a husband and two young children. My son, also always interested in aviation/ aerospace, is now a pilot for a regional airline.;46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
We saw a light in the sky that was hovering and moving too oddly to be a terrestrial aircraft.;1998-09-22 20:00:00;Unknown;We saw a light in the sky that was hovering and moving too oddly to be a terrestrial aircraft. It was about at 8:00 at night. 2 of my friends, my brother, and I were out on our bikes and we were going around our neighborhood. We were not to far from my home when we saw 3 lights in the sky. The lights were connected by a red beam, and kept hovering from place to place in odd directions. One of my friend and I, after watching it for a while, turned around and rode AT TOP SPEED back to our house. My other friend and my brother followed us after about 10 seconds. I myself must confess that I am somewhat of a UFO buff, but my other 3 companions are not too knowledgeable about UFOs.;46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
Brief horizon to horizon motion by three inter-weaving craft.;1999-04-23 02:30:00;three seconds;Brief horizon to horizon motion by three inter-weaving craft. At 2:30 am on the night of April 23rd, 1998, I was lying on the ground outside of my college dorm building staring at the night sky. My body was lying feet to the west, head to the east. The cloud cover for the sky was patchy but at about 40-50%. That night there must have also been a bright moon because I clearly remember a particularly intense luster to the clouds. I was talking with a friend when I noticed out of the corner of my right eye (to the north) movement that really only registered consciously but not so that it drew my attention. I did realize that the motion was extremely fast and for some very puzzling reason, I felt compelled to look to the south in the night sky as if I knew that it was moving so fast that to attempt to turn my head and look at it would mean missing it and instead I looked south to allow it to travel through my field of vision where I could track it with my eyes as it entered. What I saw, albeit brief, to this day is the most profound event I have ever witnessed. I was able to see the objects for no more than three seconds in the sky. They entered my vision heading south at what I would estimate at between 800-1000 mph based on the change in degree of my field of view and the time in which the change occurred. The objects were as follows: there were three light blue or grey light triangles with only the borders illuminated. That is to say that the objects looked like isoscelene triangles made of flourescent light bulbs. The objects appeared to be dodging in and out of the clouds from my vantage point. I can not, however, state with any certainty how far away they may have been or if they were above or below the clouds. It was especially difficult to tell because the illumination of the objects was not unlike that of the clouds in intensity. But, not only did the objects appear to be moving in and out of the clouds but they moved as though they were completing repeated figure-eights with each other at a very constant rate. I remember being scared deeply by the exact nature in which the objects moved with each other. I guess it scared me because I had never seen anything as geometric, fast, or precise in motion any where in the natural world around me. These certainly were not birds or aircraft. Any aircraft moving this fast would have created at least a sonic boom not to mention either a contrail or engine noise. Almost as soon as the event was recorded in my sight, it was over. I jumped to my feet and started swearing quite loudly and asking anyone of about six people within about two feet of me if they saw that. I was struck dumb with disbelief having seen something that to this day has left me with no logical answers. Here is some important info about the area. Fargo is, apparently, no stranger to the sighting of aerial phenomena as I had found out after checking out some other reportings and found that North Dakota itself is a hotbed. The area of Fargo itself where I was when I saw this event occur is not more than one mile south of the 119th Strategic Bombing Wing and an Air National Guard base. Grand Forks, ND is just 80 miles north and is home to one of the largest air bases in the United States. Often in the area, one can see large aircraft landing, committing touch-and-go's, taking off and rolling flight patterns over the area. I am not, however, even going to begin to kid myself into believing that what I saw was military aircraft or any kind of commercial aircraft. The speed was simply astounding not to mention the risk of flying three aircraft in a weave-pattern in and out of each other at ANY speed. And finally, background on me. I graduated from that college (NDSU) in 1999 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Archaeology with a specialization in cartography and linguistics. My minor degree was Psychology. I am an accomplished Martial artist and guitar instructor and I have a very well paying job working as a systems analyst in Minneapolis. I am not any sort of cuckoo or permanent day-dreamer. I have nothing to gain by reporting this event. I apologize for waiting over a year and a half to report this event but the very mention of the phrase I saw something last night I can't explain... got me glances from the wierdest of my colleagues. I hope that this report helps your efforts. God Bless and take care... A Believer. PS Due to the nature of my report, I hope that you understand my reluctance to transmit my address and name. You can, however, contact me via the email address below and I will respond as I am possible. Thank you...;46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
triangle shaped with no noise;2000-10-04 01:57:00;3 minutes;triangle shaped with no noise I was up late doing paper work for my business, when I decided to take a break and have a cigeret. I opened the patio door and stood in the thresh hold looking to the eastern sky about a minute later I was in pure shock the object I sean was a v shaped object it was very low and moving slow about 5000 feet and 130 knots. I must explain that I am a pilot and love airplanes I know and can identify almost any air plane ever built. Like I said, this object was a v shaped triangle the front was flat and so was the back the bottom was also vary flat and smooth I could see panel seams on the bottom, there was dim gray lights on all pointing down one light in front and four more on each side going back along the edges no other lights where present  the most eary thing is that there was no sound none. I can not explain what I say but I can tell you that I am not a lier and I swear to god this is the truth. ((NUFORC Note:  We received a report from several hunters for 27SE00.  Please see report for that date from Idaho.  PD));46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
Three extremely bright lights north of  NDSU appeared and disappeared quickly.;2012-04-20 00:43:00;0:45;Three extremely bright lights north of  NDSU appeared and disappeared quickly. The sighting happened about 5 miles north of NDSU campus, I was out driving with my friends when we noticed 3 lights up in the sky which appeared to come out of no where.  We noticed them right away because they were extremely bright and looked to be about 200 to 300 feet above us and off to the right.   It was hard to tell how big it was, but my best guess is about 30 feet and it was shaped like a triangle.  It sat in the same spot for about 40 minutes and then disappeared quickly.;46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
Orange glowing triangle crafts unmoving above a corn field.;2013-07-04 21:00:00;Unknown;Orange glowing triangle crafts unmoving above a corn field. July 4th, between 2011 and 2014.  Two orange, glowing triangles stationary in the sky.  I was in the back seat of the car with my mother.  I looked out the window and saw the objects.  They weren't the typical three-light triangle craft, but the entirety of the crafts glowed orange.  I watched them for as long as they were in view.  They did not move the entire time.  No buildings were in the area, and the objects were floating above a corn field.  No lanterns or fireworks bear resemblance to the crafts. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
Was in the backyard hot tub looking up at the sky and looking for shooting stars, when a triangular figure appeared.;2016-11-07 18:20:00;5-8 seconds;Was in the backyard hot tub looking up at the sky and looking for shooting stars, when a triangular figure appeared. Was in the backyard hot tub looking up at the sky and looking for shooting stars when a triangular figure that appeared to be brownish in color moved from North to South directly over Fargoâ€¦  I would guess at an altitude of 5,000 to 10,000 feet...no sound.  First thought was a plane taking off from Hector but no lights, blinking or constant were seen...just the outline of the triangle.  Never have seen anything like this, never reported anything before....wondered if it was a B2 flying from Grand Forks....who knows?;46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
