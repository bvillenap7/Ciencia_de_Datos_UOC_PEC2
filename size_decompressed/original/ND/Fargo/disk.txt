Besides me, my sister, her friend, my then-fiance, and his buddy, I remember other people outside watching it as well. I was 18. Believe me, I could make a verrry long story out of this. I'll try not to. Here goes,... On June 26, 1976, I, my sister, her friend, my then-fiance, and his buddy, went to a wedding in Morhead, MN.  I just recently found out the exact date of the wedding.  I was thinking that it was in '75.  So then I decided to try '76, and whallah!!  Found the bride and groom's wed. lic.  I know it was that night because, we went over to Fargo, N.D., right across the river.  That's where we saw it.  A huge silvery disk.   It hovered over us for about, and this is where the old memory would come in handy,..I can't remember exactly.  I just remember it hovering, and it had lights running clock-wise on it's edge.  Or rim,..the lights were all colors.  Red, blue, green, yellow, white, and for some reason I even remember a pink.   It was so close!  I remember, as it was leaving, I believe, to the east, I saw the structure of it underneath.   I know it sounds weird, but,I remember seeing like, rivets.  You probably won't publish this, I know I sound off the wall, but, after all these years, I just need to report it.   I have done research and noone has.  Maybe some else who was there, will see this, and come forward. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
