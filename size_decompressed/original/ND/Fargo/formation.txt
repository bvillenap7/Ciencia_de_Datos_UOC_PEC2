Six pairs of side by side amber lights moving in a V formation.;2010-04-10 22:00:00;10 - 15 seconds;Six pairs of side by side amber lights moving in a V formation. I was at work and on a break when I witnessed six pairs of dark amber colored lights, in a V formation, moving from SSE to NNW.  One pair of lights would be described as being two straight lines side by side similar to an equal sign, “ = “. This = seemed to be one craft. They were moving fast, with no sound, and were at an altitude of maybe 500-600 feet.   As there was no sound, I did not see them until they were almost directly overhead.  As I watched, the sides of the V crossed over each other and then “swirled” together.  At that point, they separated out again and they either increased speed and disappeared in the distance or just blinked out.  I really couldn’t say which it was.  I am a veteran police dispatcher and can honestly say I have always been a little skeptical when I took calls reporting this same type of report.  Never again.;46.8584776190476;-96.8258885714287
Cluster of fast moving lights traveling in a straight line.((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of cluster of Space Link satellites.  PD));2019-05-25 00:13:00;25 seconds;Cluster of fast moving lights traveling in a straight line. We were sitting outside near downtown Fargo and we looked up and saw a cluster of 25 to 30 individual dots traveling in a straight line from west of southwest to east of northeast. The cluster gave off a white haze and behind the cluster were 5 or 6 stragglers that followed the exact same path. They moved a little bit faster than a satellite in the night sky and had no visible blinking lights. Maybe unrelated, but after the lights were unable to be seen a neighbor's dog barked for a few seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of cluster of Space Link satellites.
