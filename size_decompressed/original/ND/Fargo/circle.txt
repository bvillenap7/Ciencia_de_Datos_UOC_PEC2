Lights over North Fargo, ND.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-05 11:24:00;7 minutes;Lights over North Fargo, ND. Went outside on apartment patio to view weather.  Which is hot and muggy, and see flashes of lightening off in the distance.  We are suppose to have a thunder storm of sorts.   When I looked up to the south of the sky I viewed what seemed to be a star which wasn't moving at a fast rate than being a plane.  Color was white but from seeing it move fast it turned into what was a circle or ball of red.   Saw one and seen 2 more others do the same thing, there were low clouds and when the clouds were moving they seemed to move past them and then disappear.   Stayed outside for about 15 minutes to see if this was a plane but it was not. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.
