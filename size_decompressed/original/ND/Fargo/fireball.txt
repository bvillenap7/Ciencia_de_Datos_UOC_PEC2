8 glowing red balls the size of quarters weaving in and out of each other, heading SW.;1998-01-15 20:30:00;3-6 seconds;8 glowing red balls the size of quarters weaving in and out of each other, heading SW. First off, the date is an EXTREMELY rough estimate. I was coming home from confirmation, there was snow on the ground. While walking from our backyard driveway to my house I saw 8 glowing red balls in the sky weaving in and out of each other as they flew past. They were heading SW. I don't know how far up they were, it looked to be about 20 or 30 feet above the trees and were the size of quarters.
