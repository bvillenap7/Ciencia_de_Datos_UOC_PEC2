It was the summer of, I believe, 1970 I was six years old. My mother and I were driving home to Lidgerwood, in southeast ND, from Fargo.  We were driving down state highway 46.  I looked out the passenger window into a field and saw a large glowing light, moving silently throught the field, pacing the car.  I asked, Mom, what's that? At such a young age, I was merely curious, completely unafraid.  I had no idea what a UFO was.  When my mother looked over at the field and saw the object, she was visibly frightened, and punched the accelerator of the car.  I remember looking at the speedometer and noticing we were driving 85 m.ph., which confused me.  Seeing my mother frightened began to make me feel a bit scared, too, and I kept looking at this glowing object as it stayed with us, approximately 100 yards into the field.  As I was so young, and all of this is a bit foggy in my memory, I can only give rough estimates.  I would say that the object was perhaps 50-60 feet long, it was difficult to see how wide it was.  It glowed brightly, and made no sound.  After a bit, i seem to have fallen asleep, I really can't remember how it all ended.  All I know is that we arrived home safely, and whenever I have asked my mother about the incident, she is reluctant to talk about the sighting, usually dismissing it as swamp gas.  As an adult looking back at what I saw, I find it hard to believe that we witnessed swamp gas glwong and pacing our car at 85 m.p.h.  Somebody regress me!!!! I want to know what I saw!!
