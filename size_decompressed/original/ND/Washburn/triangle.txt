A bluish triangular object moving in a clockwise direction.;1995-11-21 23:30:00;20 seconds;A bluish triangular object moving in a clockwise direction. I was driving north between Bismarck and Washburn when I saw a triangular object moving eastward. It appeared to be facing me, but turning in a clockwise direction. I couldn't tell if it was flying on it's side or if I was just seeing one side of a multi-dimensional object, and it's edges appeared rounded instead of sharp. It was light blue, almost white on the outer edges of it but had a darker blue glow to it until it turned to black in the middle. It may have been very big but I couldn't tell its distance from where I was. It was pretty low because I could still see the road and fields when staring straight at it, so I don't know if it was very large yet far away or smaller and closer to me. It wasn't going too fast because I got a good look at it and then it went out of my view accross the windshield (I was driving). I then just continued driving when something caught my eye to the right and I looked out the passenger window where I saw the object continuing it's path in an eastward direction over the fields. There was snow on the ground but it was such a clear crisp night and I should have stopped and at least woke one eyewitness but it all happened so quickly and I had 2 more hours of driving to do.
