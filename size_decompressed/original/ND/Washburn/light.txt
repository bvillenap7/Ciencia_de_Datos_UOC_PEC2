Slow Moving Light West of Washburn.;2014-01-25 23:30:00;10 minutes;Slow Moving Light West of Washburn On 1/25/2014 at approx. 2330 hours I observed a light in western sky.  It was at a very high altitude.  The light was brighter than any stars in the area and it moved slowly.  It also would come to a complete stop and hover.  When it was moving, a bright light would appear on to extend from the light.  It would move in the opposite direction from the side of the light extended out from.  I suspect I was observing some sort of thruster being utilized when I observed this.  However, I was not close enough to make that determination. The light came to a stop and hovered for about 5 minutes.  It then rapidly began gaining altitude until it was no longer visible.  I videotaped a few minutes of the phenomena however the video is of poor quality.  The total time I observed it was approx. 10 minutes and light did not return while I was out in the area once it gained altitude and was out of sight.;47.3114;-101.0116
