Lighted object on the ground in an empty snow covered field;2008-01-15 21:00:00;@ 1-2 Min;Lighted object on the ground in an empty snow covered field I was just reading Filers Files #31 2010 and came across a report of what my wife and I saw a couple of years ago while driving from Fargo ND to Wahpeton ND on I29. The craft was on the ground @ 1/4 to 1/2 mile east of I29 putting on a light show! In any case, we have never told anyone about it, partly because we did not see it flying, but more so that we could not really describe the shape .... in this Filers files  is a report fron Baton Rouge LA, and the decription is perfect! It was a saucer shape but made of rectangle shaped panels all around the sides flashing bright colors, as they described white, blue, yellow , red and green. While basically round, it had a 'jointed' look to it. This was in the winter on a clear, moonlit night, and it had snowed recently, so the colors and craft were highly visible. In this area we have long tree rows which divide fields, and some of them are miles long. The object was sitting on the north side of one of those. I have always had the feeling that it is odd that we did not stop, but it was almost like something was telling us to 'move along'.... very strange behavior for me. But we had a fairly long time to view it as the field it was in was in our direct view for several miles, with no obstructions to the view. Anyway, just wanted to share that! My wife will be blown away when she reads the report in Filers Files! ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date is approximate.  PD));46.4574;-96.8737
