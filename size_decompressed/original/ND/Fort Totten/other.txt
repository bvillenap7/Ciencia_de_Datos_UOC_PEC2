moving objects in the sky;2001-07-22 23:00:00;1 hour;moving objects in the sky Okay we were sitting outside having some tea because it was so warm out. All of a sudden my auntie seen something behind us and I looked back and I seen two star-looking things going in unison towards my right. I couldnt beleieve that I was actually witnessing something because I always try to keep an eye out for unsual activity in the sky. anyway we sat there for an hour watching these move around in the sky all over. At times there was also a flashing one in which the the others seem to go towards. I know for a fcat they were NOT fighter jets or planes or falling stars and even satelites.;47.9811;-99.0264
