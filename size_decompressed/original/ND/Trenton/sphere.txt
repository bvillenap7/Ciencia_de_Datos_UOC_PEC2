Small reddish-orange flickering sphere/ovoid object spotted moving south from Trenton, North Dakota.;2014-09-13 22:08:00;4 minutes;Small reddish-orange flickering sphere/ovoid object spotted moving south from Trenton, North Dakota. I was driving east on highway 1804 heading towards Williston, North Dakota, when I spotted an object flying south to southeast across the highway.  I pulled over where highway 1804 approaches the northwest corner of Lake Trenton to observe.  I took a video using my iPhone.  It was too dark for the video to be of any use, but it did provide me with accurate location, time, and duration of the sighting. The object was approximately 100ft in the air and 200 ft from me when I pulled to the side of the road.  I flashed my head lights at it, but got no response.  I exited my vehicle and watched it continued to travel silently, perhaps fifteen to thirty miles per hour, away from me at a consistent altitude until disappearing out of sight.  The object had a reddish orange flickering light at its center.  It was roughly the size of a large trash can and spherical to ovoid in shape, but the central light made its boundaries diffuse and hard to definitively make out.;48.0681;-103.8341
