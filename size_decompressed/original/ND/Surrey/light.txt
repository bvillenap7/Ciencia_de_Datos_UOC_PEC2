I was driving North on a gravel road, the object(s) were very low to ground three simultaneously blinking blue lights heading East to West, traveling faster than anything I've seen.   I saw it from as directly above me as I could see and was out of sight within a matter of seconds.  By the time I was able to comprehend what was happening the object(s) were gone.
