The falling stars somtimes stop;2012-04-14 06:00:00;5 minutes;the falling stars somtimes stop since 2004 a great number ufo have been entering our airspace but they either slip into a cloud or very quickly take off at light speed each time followed by a fighter jet or silent helocopters.  This town is a chippiwa indian reservation and has no airport and is very close to the canadien border. Any way the first sighting was in 2004 above the trees behind my house it looked like a shooting star but it was traveling sideways and not down and then it stopped and stayed in place untill two silent helocopters surrounded it and shinned their flood lights o it the ufo shot strait up and was gone.2012 my girl came into the house screaming about a ufo I looked and saw the object being followedbuta jet.
