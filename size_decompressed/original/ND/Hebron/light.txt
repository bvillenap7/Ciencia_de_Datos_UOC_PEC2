I was traveling East on I94 approx. 2200 hrs. It was a clear night yet I could see the outline of the horizon.I was between Hebron and New Salem ND. I noticed directly ahead of me on the north side of the interstate, a bright white light just stationary above a hill. I assumed it was part of a radio/communications tower, but it grew brighter as I approached it. There are few curves to this road so I was really interested in what I was approaching. I got to about 1 mi. of this light when it suddenly shot upwards at an increadible speed at a 45 degree angle away from me eastward. I observed it getting smaller as it sped upwards until it simply vanished due to its distance away.;46.891;-102.0325
