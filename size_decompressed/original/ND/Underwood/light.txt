4 white lights at high altitude;2005-07-03 23:00:00;2 hours;4 white lights at high altitude 11 pm central we were near Underwood lighting firewoks. As soon as our last artillery shell went off 3 of us saw a single bright white light shoot across the sky just above where the firework went off. One hour later while driving past Washburn we saw a single bright light wobbeling across the sky heading east, several thousand feet up. At 1 am two more bright lights were seen near Bismarck, one traveling faster than the other, racing towards the north northwest. I made two attempts to photograph the wobbling light but it was too dim for the camera to pick up. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));47.4602;-101.1898
