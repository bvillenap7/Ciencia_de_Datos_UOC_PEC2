sighting in western north dakota;2005-02-25 22:20:00;45minutes;sighting in western north dakota On Feb. 25,2005 at about 10:20 p.m. i was leaving a bar in Glen Ullin, nd and heading home. Directly south of the area i noticed an unusual light in the sky at what looked about 4500 feet in the air and what looked to be about eight miles south of where i was, overa local lake. i watched for a few minutes and noticed the light get very bright then dim a few times. it was sort of blue white and remunded me of a search light on the bottom of a helicopter.  while watching i noticed another light (not the same color, almost slightly amber)come towards the first light, then stop moving. i knew that this must be a ufo and callled the people in the bar(5) to come see. we watched a couple minutes during which time a small plane flew almost between the object and us, then went back into the bar. one individual said he had seen ufos many times before.  after a short time i decided to drive home (about 35 miles north) during the drive i watched the light through my rearview mirror. after about 23 miles i stopped, got out of my truck and notice the lights again. they had risen in the air to approx. 10,000 feet and moved about 25 miles further north. by this time i could see an outline of the crafts shape (Chevron) and that the craft was in my estimation about three times the size of a 747 jet. (if i had held a quarter at arms length it would not cover the object) I continued my drive the rest of the way to the town i live in and after that the object was still in the air, only a little higher and further north. the drive took approx. 40-45 minutes.  i went into another bar for about an hour and when i came out the object was gone.;46.8218;-101.8256
