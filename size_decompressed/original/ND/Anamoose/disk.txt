Starting at 6 pm we watched 5 of these donut like spinners above heads and smaller bright ones coming out of them then would fly in a line and vanish.   At 11:15 pm I went back outside and there was one huge one even with the naked eye full of color, spinning  these have been out here every night for the past month. The ones from earlier that were emitted from the larger ones had moved across sky, stopped hovered together then a flash of red and white and took off.;47.8703;-100.2529
