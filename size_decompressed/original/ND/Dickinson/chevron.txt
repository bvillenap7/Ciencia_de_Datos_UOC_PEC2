Grey V shaped craft gliding silently over town. It was dark around 9 P.M MST. Object appeared dark grayish color. ((anonymous report));2018-11-09 21:00:00;10 seconds;Grey V-shaped craft gliding silently over town.  It was dark around 9 P.M mountain time.   Object appeared dark grayish color (again it was dark) but hard to be certain.  Was maybe 600-1000 yards up.  Hard to tell.   There was a cloud layer as well.  The clouds were fairly low that night.  Only reason I even saw it and was able to make out its shape.  I was standing outside and staring out into the sky as I do many nights.  The flying V just happened to cross in my field of view and caught my attention.  It was visible for about 10 seconds before I lost track of it in the dark.  No lights at all at any point, and no sound! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));46.8069925925925;-102.756955555556
