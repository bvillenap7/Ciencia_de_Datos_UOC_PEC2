Lights in Dickinson, ND.;2011-07-04 21:00:00;10-15 minutes;Lights in Dickinson, ND After working my night shift at the airport 4 miles south of town, I started heading back north towards town on Hwy 22.  It was a warm, clear night and shortly after turning on to the highway, I noticed two separate lights in the sky with the furthest north one seeming to be just south of town. I slowed down while driving to get a better look at them, thinking that since it was the 4th of July they might be wish candles.  Neither of them appeared to be moving however and it was then I noticed two more further south.  All four of the lights seemed to be in a perfectly straight line extending about 30 miles or so to the southwest of town. I called my wife to let her know I was off work as I kept driving into town.  As I was about parallel to the furthest north light, I mentioned the lights to her and she said they were probably the wish candles.  About that time, I saw lights on the northern object start blinking like an aircraft. I hung up the phone and sped through town to get a better vantage point on a high butte.  By the time I got up there though, I was unable to see any of the lights.  I kept this whole incident to myself until recently I was looking online at videos of UFO's and I noticed a comment from a user (on a video on UFO's in Dickinson) that he had spotted the same thing two days earlier.;46.8069925925925;-102.756955555556
