I immediatly spotted a couple satelites and then about five minutes later looking to the Northeast I spotted three points of light forming a triangle gliding across the sky in a southeast projection staying on it's course with all three lights at the exact same intensity! I was able to view it for a full two minutes as it earily glided across the sky. I tried to see if I could see stars in the background but couldn't although it did not seem to be on a path where you could see a lot of stars and as it came up to one bright star the left light in the back lined up with that star perfectly so I could still not make out if it was a solid object! If it was a solid object it would of had to of been huge! the lights moved together as if it was one object! It appeared to move slower than most satelites I have seen and if I would of been looking North a little earlier I probaly would of gotten to view it for four minutes. This is the third time now I have seen this formation in the last three summers or years! It still is very earie to watch! I was so mesmerized by it,I failed to take the binoculars off to see if you could see it with the naked eye! I believe though that if one would of been looking I think they could of been seen! This thrird time now I noticed it was on pretty much the same course as it was last year when I saw it! I watched it until it got to far east and then the lights just faded out! ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the three U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellites may have been the cause of the sighting.  Please see other report from Ontario, Canada, for an explanation.

Triangular UFO with lights on the exterior;2003-12-01 05:00:00;10 seconds;Triangular UFO with lights on the exterior This ufo was a triangular shape with (flashing)lights. I think it may have been a blue color. It was moving in a fast motion and in weird ways it seemed to be moving further away from me and then I went to call for someone and when I went outside again it was gone. I can't remember the size but it was big but not as big as a plane.;46.8069925925925;-102.756955555556
