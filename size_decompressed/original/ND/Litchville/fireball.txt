Bright Burning Fire Ball Very Large Black Dark Contrail leaving our space.;2017-12-29 17:32:00;2-3 minutes;Bright Burning Fire Ball Very Large Black Dark Contrail leaving our space. On the 29th of December 2017, at close to 5:32 pm, I saw a Burning object skirting across the southern sky at about the 4 o'clock position flying above a cloud bank that was on the edge of the North and South Dakota borders.  I live about 40 miles north of the South Dakota Border and Skies were clear.  I was watching a few deer I feed in my farm yard and it was dark enough only to see them closely with a pair of good Binoculars.  As I was watching them, I noticed a burning object in the top of the lens flying across the sky what I thought was about 30-40 miles away and left the most large contrail I have ever seen dark like the clouds it was flying over.  It had a flame that looked like a burning oil well fire like you lit a farmers match but real black contrail.   At first I thought it was something burning up coming into our atmosphere and coming or flying in a North East Direction, but it was flying parallel to the clouds then started to fly upward in a north east direction and once it got up in the sky the object turned into just a bright light no flames I could see any more.  It flew up to a tiny spec and then was lost in the stars that were just coming out to see at an 11:00 position looking south.  I could not tell any form. It was just luck I had seen this but was quite a thing to see.  I live on a farm in a very remote area and have no light pollution.  I reported this to a local radio station and he read my email on air.  I wanted to see if anyone else had seen it and there were no responses.  This would be my 3rd object I have seen over the years I have lived here.  Always looking for our visitors in the skies.;46.6569;-98.1941
