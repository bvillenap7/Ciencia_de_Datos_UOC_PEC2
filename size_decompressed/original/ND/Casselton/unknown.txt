The object is NNE of the Casselton area. The object sits in one place and does not move. It is not an aircraft, but imitates the lights on aircraft red, blueish, and amber.  It is in the sky every evening, just blinking lights.  There is a smaller one north of it, with the same colors.  There is also one in Moorhead, Minnesota, same exact flashing lights  There are others in the same area, but are further away, but can see thru my binoculars, the red, blue, and amber flashing lights.;46.8964;-97.2156
