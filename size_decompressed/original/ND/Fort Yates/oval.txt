One day we will meet.;1978-05-15 23:00:00;multiple;One day we will meet. These sittings where viewed in four stages, around Christmas 1975, my grand father with family and a friend following him, sighted a large light along side traveling 1806 north they stopped viewed that light for about 15 Min. until this light darted off into the stars like a blink.   Then again me and the two friends where headed for  South Dakota about 12:00 am central time May 1978, when we hade to go to the ditch to relieve, my friends were place around the car we could see the town clearly , the sky was clear also.  then it happened, a huge large disk shaped lighted craft was just above us and the REA lines about 15 ft. stood there for about 1 min. then disappeared, us seeing stars once again.  Again July 4th 2017 around 12:pm, we were sitting out side my trailer, we could see Fort Yates, North Dakota about 5 miles as the crows fly   We realized a bright red ball light was just above the town it moved away stood still and 3-lights came for no where all 3 lights lined up under the red ball then want another directions, the red ball continued to come our direction went between our large hill to the east and my trailer about 40 ft. stood still for about 5 min. then headed south and gone.  I moved to South Dakota , one night we came home around 1:am, my wife went home to the trailer and I walked home closing my gates.   I seen a lights come from south west at a high rate of speed, stopped just above me about 50 ft. and continued slowly east.  I feel these crafts are following me or keeping an eye on me because I have a spirit given to me by four Medicine Men that are my grandfathers, gone now, but maybe other sightings will continue until the finial meeting of both parties.  I just hade to get this off my chest and tell your department these sittings gone through , thank you your attention.;46.0935;-100.6476
