Missing Time;1975-10-15 18:00:00;5 Minutes;I was approximately 8 years old. My sister was driving us home, located towards the north end of town. It was an overcast day, slightly misty, but not so much so as to impede visibility to a large degree. We were alone on the road, and I noticed some objects to the left of the car, very low to the ground, pacing our car. I recall my sister being frightened, and I was scared as well. I recall her speeding up to try and outrun the objects, but they stayed with us. Interestingly, the next thing I remember is being on my front step, and it was now very dark, and much later. The whole missing time thing. I've never spoken of this with my sister, and now, so many years later, I am not really sure about how to bring it up to her.
