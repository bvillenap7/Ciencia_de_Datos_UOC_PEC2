Strange craft may have caused shorts on rail road tracks;2012-03-01 03:00:00;15 minutes;Strange craft may have caused shorts on rail road tracks I worked for the railroad and was called out on a trouble call early AM in the mourning.  The trouble call was that the two tracks had a short for several miles. This was unusual because to do this it would cause four circuits to go bad at the same time.   Each circuit running through the track has its own back up batteries and it is unheard of for all four to short at same time.   I got on the track with my high rail truck and headed west  inspecting the track as I went.  About half way I noticed a flash of light coming at me at a high speed.  At first I thought meteor.  It startled me and I slammed on my brakes.  By the time I stopped  a blue light hovered about 20 ft away from the front of my truck.  I tried to back up and it shot to the rear of my truck forcing me to stop and go forward again.  It  then shot in front of my truck again. I stopped again  the craft then hovered around my truck making  quick moves right to left.  This lasted several minutes.  I finally got my wits back and  took several pictures with my cell phone.  Shortly after I started taking pictures it shot off to the south at high speed and was gone.  I have the ability to monitor the shorts on the track with my laptop in real time.  Within minutes of the craft leaving the shorts went away.  I cleared the trouble ticket  as problem cleared on its own.  Later I told my supervisor and manager and showed them the pictures.;48.2078845238095;-103.645198809524
