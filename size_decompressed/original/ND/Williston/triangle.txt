Three orange dots in a triangular shape over ND;2008-08-31 01:10:00;4 - 5 Seconds;Three orange dots in a triangular shape over ND My friend and I were outside having a cigarette. My friend stated UFO! and pointed in the sky.  I looked up and saw three orange dots traveling northeast to Southwest. The dots were in a triangular shape traveling at a high rate of speed faster than a shooting star.  The dots were spaced evenly as they moved.  Just before we lost site of the shape the bottom two dots broke formation and headed in opposite directions as if the shape were expanding.  The dots picked up speed and we lost site of them.;48.2078845238095;-103.645198809524
triangle sighting that was in the same spot for over 4 hours only moved in figured 8 ways  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably not a UFO.  PD));2010-07-24 01:00:00;over 5 hours;triangle sighting that was in the same spot for over 4 hours only moved in figured 8 ways, the craft was a triangle it was staying in the same area just moving slightly it could move from side to side back to back and never had to turn around it had no lights but u could see it threw the clouds,  It coverd the north star several times  I called the cops at about 1:45 or so at about 2:50am they showed up they all seen it and hed no explanation, one said it may be a kite but theres no way a kite could be that high and be in the same spot for over 4 hours and cover the north star. Needless to say i didnt get any sleep and by the time the sun started to come up it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably not a UFO.  PD));48.2078845238095;-103.645198809524
