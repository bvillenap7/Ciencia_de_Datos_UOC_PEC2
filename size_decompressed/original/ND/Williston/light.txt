Driving at night, saw a blue light, all electronics suddenly shut off;2006-05-01 22:00:00;Unknown;Driving at night, saw a blue light, all electronics suddenly shut off Conditions: clear night sky, dark, no weather. I was driving eastbound on 1804, east of Buford, heading towards Williston. I was driving a 1998 Lincoln (great condition) and had 3 children with me, 2 of whom were sleeping.  My oldest child (12 yr old) was awake and recalls the event as well. With peripheral vision, I noticed a bright blue light traveling above the tree line, about a mile away, at the exact speed we were traveling (65 mph).  This took place over about 30 - 40 seconds, until I recall turning my head to get a better look (by now I had ruled out almost everything else that could be doing this).  I can remember gazing at the light briefly (it was definitely above the tree line, and there was sky noted between it and the earth, with nothing holding it up) before EVERYTHING 'electrical' in my car shut off briefly before returning to function as though it never happened. I'm talking headlights, every dash light,stereo, cell phones, hand held video games, MP3 player...everything. I don't recall the engine ever sputtering. Afterwards, I noticed that the light was no longer following us. I was so calm, almost as though it were no big deal I'm the type of person whose heart usually stops beating at any driving 'close call'. Talking with my son later, he said it was almost dream like in recollection (he normally has impeccable recall). I also recall getting to our destination later than expected and wondering why. (This doesn't need to be included with the report, but it is interesting) Almost 10 years later, an MRI of my brain showed a perfectly square abnormality that only appeared in one imaging slice, which means that it was extremely thin. Neurologist said he'd never seen anything like it and joked about it being an alien implant.);48.2078845238095;-103.645198809524
