High altitude (or low orbit) light moving at extreme speeds in a zig-zag pattern. Lake Ashtabula (10 miles N of Valley City, ND) I had been stargazing and watching a meteor shower with my girlfriend and my grandparents on this evening. Around 11:30pm, everyone started heading into the cabin to go to bed but I decided to stay by the fire for awhile longer. As I was about to get up,  I saw what at first looked like a satellite, however it moved at extreme speeds in a zig-zag pattern.  It appeared to be at high altitude or low earth orbit.  People know me as a space nerd so when I saw this and told my girlfriend, she believed me when I said it was not a satellite or spacecraft.  It may have been blinking but I cannot remember for sure.  I am also an aircraft pilot, so I know it was not an aircraft.;46.9232;-98.0056
