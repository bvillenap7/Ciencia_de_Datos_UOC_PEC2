I kept my eyes on this dark grey mass for several minutes until I stopped the truck to observe what I was whatching with our binoculars, when I first looked at the mass I was expecting to see a large group of waterfowl a mile or so away however what I saw was a tear-shaped dark grey object that was almost stationary,  Both my wife and I whatched it for several minutes before it began to head off to the east and then southeast, once the object started moving we watched it several more minutes moving beneath clouds as it first began to head east it was redish in appearence then once it turned more southerly it turned a bright yellow a reflection from the sun I assume.  Both my wife and I are certain and have come to the conclusion this was not any type of conventional aircraft for several reasons including the fact it hardly moved for sevral minnute, how long we observed it, the fact we watched it with binoculars as long as we did and never once did it look like a conventional aircraft.  I have spent a great deal of time watching the sky and have never once seen anything I could not identify, plane move accross North Dakota every day and somtime you watch them wondering were they are going and from were.  I can't even imagine how many times sitting in one of my duck blinds I have only aircraft to watch flying overhead if the ducks are not flying.  I truly hope someone else had seen what we did to get a second prespective of what it was  E,;46.0962;-100.212
