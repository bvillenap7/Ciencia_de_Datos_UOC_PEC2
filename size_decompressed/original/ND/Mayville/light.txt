Slow moving Ball of White Light with several different other colors attached above small town in ND;2011-12-20 18:45:00;15 MIN;Slow moving Ball of White Light with several different other colors attached above small town in ND The town of Mayville is approximately 4 miles WSW (almost West) of my house as the crow flies. My driveway is .2 miles straight and the entrance faces Mayville. At 18:45 I went to walk to the mail box. Above the grain bin lights of Mayville, I noticed a Ball of White light with Red, Blue, and Green intermittent lights which weren’t blinking, just appearing then disappearing in a seemingly random pattern. At first I thought it may have been a Helicopter, no noise, it was just hovering. I then noticed 3 single engine prop planes (used extensively in the area for crop dusting). These 3 planes were coming from different directions. You could hear their engine noises. Their flight pattern suggested there was a destination – one was heading North, one heading East, the other heading South. Their moving lights and sound suggested they were close to Mayville at the normal altitude. The light I saw was moving slowly toward the West and in comparison to the Prop plane! s was extremely bright. After ruling out a helicopter, I thought it might have been a star. A star cannot move and the cloud cover was at first above the light then the light went into the cloud cover. You could see a ‘glow’ from the clouds. This was ruled out when it disappeared into the low flying clouds.;47.5049;-97.3166
