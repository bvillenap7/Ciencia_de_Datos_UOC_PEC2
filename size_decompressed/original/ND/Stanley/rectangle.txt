Large object, resembling a flat iron, sat motionless off the highway.;2021-01-15 12:04:00;10 minutes;Large object, resembling a flat iron, sat motionless off the highway. We were hauling a load of heating oil, eastbound from Stanley, on RT 2, when my partner called my attention to an unusual object on the north side of the highway. The object resembled a dark colored flat iron, approximately 75’ wide, and close to 100’ long. From top to bottom, I’d say it was 30', and it appeared to be sitting on hundreds of points, or legs, which kept it between 15’ and 20’ off the ground.  Weather at the time, about 12:04 PM, was 19 degrees Fahrenheit, wind blowing from the north at 16 mph, gusting 23 mph, and the skies were overcast.  I radioed the police department, back in Stanley, back at City Hall, and let them know what we had seen. They said that another caller had notified them about the object, and that a deputy was in route to the location.;48.3458;-102.4185
