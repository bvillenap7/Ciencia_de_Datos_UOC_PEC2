Multiple objects over Eastern North Dakota.;2011-04-07 01:40:00;10 seconds;Multiple objects over Eastern North Dakota. I was outside smoking when I looked up at the sky looking at the stars.  After a few minutes I noticed dim high flying objects that moved from south east to the north east.  These objects moved at a rapid pace no sound and in sort of a V shape.  At first I thought it was birds probably geese or pelicans, but the height at which they were flying was far above that of a nearby jet that flew over shortly after.   As I watched there was one lead object followed by the others in which the followers had moved and changed places rapidly.  After about 10 seconds they just vanished.  I know that any type of local bird moving through the area cannot move that fast or fly at that height.  The formation was that of what appeared to be a v type but the objects were moving while flying in a straight line.;47.9123949275363;-97.0813166666666
Firework- like balls of light dart and merge into a swelling ball of light.;2012-09-03 03:03:00;5 minutes;Firework- like balls of light dart and merge into a swelling ball of light. That night I was outside smoking.  It was 3:03 am.  I saw some flashing light that looked like firework balls- only they moved very fast- they would fade and almost disappear, then rush back into view again.  They would move out and away from each other- then merge together again- quickly.  They began merging and then would form a glowing ball of white light, which would grow in size. Then it would break apart and repeat.   I grabbed my phone, and recorded it.  My dogs were unusually silent- they stood still next to me.  Then the last time, it grew to be so bright and huge,  It almost like it knew I was watching or something.  I then clicked some photos instead of video- but when it merged and got brighter and bigger - it was like it was coming towards me.  So, I got scared and went back inside quickly. The video was not on my phone any longer. The pictures were still there though. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
