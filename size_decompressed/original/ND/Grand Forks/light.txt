The sky turned green and electricity went haywire!;2006-01-04 05:00:00;3 seconds;The sky turned green and electricity went haywire! The sky lit up all around, like daylight. Unlike daylight, it shone mint green.  Other observers from a 60 mile radius reported the same thing on a radio station. Apparently alarm clocks quit working, but microwaves and other appliances stayed on. At least 3 other radio stations in the area were knocked off the air.

Satiellite looking objects about to intersect when one changed its direction of travel.;2007-04-14 22:40:00;10 SEC;Satiellite looking objects about to intersect when one changed its direction of travel. My first UFO Sitting: Just minuets ago while looking for satellites I observed an object that was very similar to a satellite Traveling from N to slightly SW in a straight line, steady speed, white in color and the same size and traveling the same speed as a satellite While watching the path of this satellite looking object  I observed another satellite that was going to intersect with the path of the first at about a 30 degree angle,  but they didnâ€™t intersect as they approached the intersecting point they spread back apart to a very noticeable distance then began to intersect again. As they were about to intersect they then moved back apart again then traveled along side each other till they disappeared. Not much to confirm but I know the angel that they both  were to intersect at was not the angle that one of the objects were on when they both disappeared.

Bright light in eastern ND sky.;2014-07-25 23:00:00;10 minutes;bright light in eastern nd sky I went out to have a smoke at 11:00 pm.  Looking up at the stars i noticed one bright light that I thought was a plane.  It was a bright white light with no flashing lights.  It seemed to turn, and as it did, it turned into three bright lights for a few moments and disappeared.   I watched for it to reappear and it never did;47.9123949275363;-97.0813166666666
