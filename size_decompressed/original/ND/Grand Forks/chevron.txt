Large rounded V shaped craft moved silently from South to North.;2020-07-12 00:00:00;5-10 seconds;Large rounded V shaped craft moved silently from South to North. A friend and myself were sitting on my deck watching for the meteor shower. While we watched, I saw a large V shaped object appear and start moving from S to N. The corners were all rounded. It moved straight with the rounded point of the V in the front. It had no individual lights. It was grey/metallic and seemed to either be reflecting the city lights or the entire craft was dimly glowing. It made no noise and moved slower than an aircraft. As it went over my house, I stood up so I could continue watching and at the same time my friend yelled “I saw that!” We tried to explain it away but could not. The skies were crystal clear, there were no events happening with big lights or anything. We have an airbase nearby but it didn’t look like anything I’ve ever seen. It was a boomerang/rounded V shape. No tail, nothing inside of the V. I would say at the very least as large as a 747, but was much lower in the sky than they fly. Very strange.;47.9123949275363;-97.0813166666666
