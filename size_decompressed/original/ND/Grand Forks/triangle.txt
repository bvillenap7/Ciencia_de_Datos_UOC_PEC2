Triangle shaped UFO with 3 dots in each corner no lights, sphere and worm like object in sky;2009-08-13 11:56:00;3-5 seconds each time;Triangle shaped UFO with 3 dots in each corner no lights, sphere and worm like object in sky We were standing  on top of the parking ramp and watching the meteor shower on Aug 13 and we looked up and there was a triangle shaped  object that was flying lower than airplanes do so we knew that it wasn't an airplane. It had 3 dots on it in each corner where it looked like lights should of been but they were off. It had no lights on it which made it more strange. Right away we started freaking out cause it was unbelievable and we both were saying We werent just seeing things. It was scary and unlike anything we both have ever seen. It was like it appeared out of no where n flew slow above us for a second and it started to go faster and then we don't know where it went. It must of been silver but it looked like a brownish color and was lighter than the night sky. It was so crazy that tears just started rolling down my face. Me and my friend both were freaking out and got scared. We both are not the type of people to lie . Right after it happened I calle! d my boyfriend and he came with 7 people and we went back to the parking ramp because we were scared to go alone and we were even scared to look at the sky after that.  After we got there and told them about it we felt like they didnt believe us except for my boyfriend because he is into UFO stuff. A little later we saw this sphere that looking things that looked like it was turning in the sky. There was no lights on it or anything and most of us saw it. It was moving fast and then disapeared it was also the same color as the triangle ufo. We didn't know what that was because again we never saw anything like that. A few minutes later we saw this worm looking things. Everybody saw that one. It would move like a caterpillar and shrivel up then stretch out. Each time it would shrivel up different though. It was long maybe 30 feet, thats just an estimate. I thought it was something falling out of the sky or a shriveled up blimp but as we kept looking we realized it wasn't anyth! ing like that. It was moving kind of slow and it disappeared a! fter abo ut 4-5 seconds. I couldn't believe it because that was the third strange thing we saw that night. After that everyone believed me and my friend that we saw  that triangle object. The triangle object was the most weirdest  thing out of all of those. SO was the worm like thing because none of us have ever seen anything like that and the next day I tried to look it up and couldn't figure out what it was. None of these objects had lights on it. The triangle ufo looked like the lights were just off. That experience opened my mind up . All of the things we saw were all silent and wouldn't of been able to be captured on camera.;47.9123949275363;-97.0813166666666
I spotted a large trinagular shaped craft travelling slowly over the southside of Grand Forks while stargazing in fall of 2009.;2009-10-09 21:30:00;5-10 minutes;I spotted a large trinagular shaped craft travelling slowly over the southside of Grand Forks while stargazing in fall of 2009. It was about 9:30 on the night of October 9, 2009. I was in my backyard stargazing through my telescope.  I was initially looking to the south and went to point my scope to the south east, whereupon I noticed a large triangular shaped craft moving slowly and silently across the sky towards the southeast. There were no clouds that night and only a slight breeze.  The object moved silently and had no noticeable lights.  Initially I thought it might be a small plane from UND or perhaps a military craft from the nearby Air Force base.   However, I ruled these out when I noticed no red or green wing tip lights, and because the object was so large, moved slowly, and without sound.  I watched the craft move slowly across the southeast side of town before it disappeared in the distance. The shape of the object was somewhere between a triangle and curved wedge shape similar to XR-900 (http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/XR-900_Geopelia) from Ace Combat 3. I know that sounds a bit strange but that is the closest thing I can describe the object/craft to.   While there were no lights there appeared to be a dull orange glow around the back edge of the object/craft.  I tried training my telescope on the object but because it was so black (aside from the trailing edge) I could not discern any additional details.   This sighting very much scared me and after I was hesitant to star gaze for a couple months.   I got a bad feeling while watching the object.;47.9123949275363;-97.0813166666666

Black triangle UFO hovering East to West over a University Campus;2016-06-28 09:00:00;5 minutes;Black Triangle UFO hovering East to West over a University Campus I observed a UFO while I was walking out of my apartment building.  I observed it at about 300 feet AGL.  It was black and was in the shape of a triangle.  It seemed to be piloted.  It was not in the normal shape of an unmanned aerial system.   The wind was reported to light and variable at the time of the sighting.   The UFO was also seen by multiple people I talked with that were in the area.  It had no detail to it.  It was solid black.   It moved across the sky East to West slowly.  Winds are predominantly from the North.;47.9123949275363;-97.0813166666666
