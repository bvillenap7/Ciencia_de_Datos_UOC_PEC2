US-2, Just past Rugby, ND.;2015-04-03 21:15:00;5 seconds;US-2 Just past Rugby, ND. US-2 Westbound Just past Rugby, ND.  There were a bunch of people pulled off the side of the road looking upward.  I stopped and right as I stopped this thing flew overhead about 100 feet in the air, fumbled for my phone but got the shot off thru my sunroof.  The object was rotating and about the size of a round type water tower.  Probably 200ft across in diameter..  There were three of these light things under it.  The actual object was triangular and was so big as it passed over the other people stated it blacked out the stars in the sky and was silent. Photo:  ((deleted by NUFORC.  Spam?))
