We were sitting in our living room at about 9:15 p.m. when a strange light caught my husband's attention.   He jumped up & went to the window & called me to look at what he saw.   It was a bright orangish/red oblong burning ball or at least something that looked like it was on fire.  It came over the top of the trees, but we could not tell how far it was away from us, or even how large it was.  It made no sound.   We dashed outside to get a closer look.  We watched it for about 30 seconds to a minute & then it turned & slowly moved away from us in a northwesterly direction.   We yelled for our neighbor to join us & he was able to see it, though by that time it was much further away & then disappeared out of sight.   The total sighting lasted approximately 3 minutes.;47.3574;-102.3365
