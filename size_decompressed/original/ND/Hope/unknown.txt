I was laying in bed looking out the window at the stars to the north and I suddenly noticed what looked like a very large star.  As I was watching it I realized it was moving toward me to the south.  I got out of bed and went to the window.  The object was moving very fast.  It was orange but I could not distinguish a shape.  All of a sudden it turned green and changed direction moving to the north and quickly disappeared into the black sky.;47.3202;-97.713
