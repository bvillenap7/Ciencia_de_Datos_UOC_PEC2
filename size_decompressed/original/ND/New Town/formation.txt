My husband and I were driving and in the distance in front of us looked like a very small tornado or &quotdirt devil.&quot My husband and I argued about what exactly it was. That was on our way into New Town, ND from Hwy 83 traveling on Hwy 23.  We stayed in New Town for 15 or so and on the way back down 23 we spotted it agian.  The sky is clear!! No clouds!! Then we realized there we more than one. There was another one behind us.  They would fade in and out.. I know this sounds really crazy but at one point it looked like the Eiffel Tower was infront of us!!  Like a hologram!!!   My husband and I are both from Texas and have seen a funnel cloud or dirt storm (or a funnel cloud of dirt) but this was different.  We both of sound mind and do not drink or do drugs.  Our eyesight is great!   We can't figure out wether it was something in the atmosphere playing tricks on oxp wether it was something that cant be explained.
