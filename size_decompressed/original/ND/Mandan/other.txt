My view was blocked temporarily by a stand of trees, but seconds later, having passed the trees, I saw the formation again.  It was headed into the river and one by one the luminescent balls of lights went into the water. There was no other traffic to cause a reflection.  No planes were flying overhead. Upon arriving home, I immediately made notes and a drawing of what I had seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));46.8298;-100.9111
