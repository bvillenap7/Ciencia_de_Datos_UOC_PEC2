It looked like lights were flashing all around the object The first fifteen minutes the object stayed in one place with small, quick movements. The object had flashing white lights that blinked often. I was able to capture several pictures on 35mm film. It also emitted a small beam of light similar in shape to a lighthouse's light with a circular rotation around the aircraft. After the fifteen minutes, I decided to check out UFO websites for reporting. When I came inside to do this the object was in the same place as I originally saw it. I had to go back outside to see if it was still there when the form asked for a duration period. The object had changed its position. It had moved farther away to the northwest by approximately 7 degrees. As of 0100 hours I can no longer see the object. I only observed 1 object. I am employed by a construction supply company. I am 34 years old with two children.;46.8298;-100.9111
