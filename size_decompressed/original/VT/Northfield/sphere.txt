bright white,silvery ball of light, soft ball sized in backyard;2005-07-19 22:30:00;5 seconds;bright white,silvery ball of light, soft ball sized in backyard I was outside with the dogs in the backyard and out of the corner of my left eye I started to see a bright light.  When I looked up, I saw a soft-ball sized or slightly larger ball of light that was silvery and white in color, fairly bright, travelling pretty fast, maybe 50 - 60 mph.  It was against a black night sky and dark trees because it was night time.  It looked like it came out of a treed aread overhead, passed between another tree and near the roof of the house.  It was maybe no more than 20-30 feet overhead.  There was no sound.  It passed by within a second or two.  There was no sign of it after I went and looked around the corner of the house.  When I saw it my first thought was that I was seeing a shooting star.  But, then I realized that it was so closes overhead that it wasn't a shooting star at all, and it wasn't arcing, it was going in a straight, linear direction from my left to my right, in a perfect straight line, no arcing.;44.1496;-72.6544
