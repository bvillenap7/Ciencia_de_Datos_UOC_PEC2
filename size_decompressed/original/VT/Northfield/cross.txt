Multiple cross shaped lights zig zagging in sky;2020-04-02 20:00:00;30;multiple cross shaped lights zig zagging in sky Was driving on the road and pulled over to look at the stars, looked up and noticed the stars were zig zagging and moving across the sky, I knew no plane helicopter or aircraft can move the way they did, some of them looked like they were coming and going, they all seemed spread out in some sort of grid, first time seeing something like this with my own eyes. tried to take a video but the night sky was just pure black because of my phone camera.;44.1496;-72.6544
