Fast Moving UFO's over mountains of Vermont.;2010-04-13 21:00:00;2 mins;Fast Moving UFO's over mountains of Vermont. While standing outside looking up at the amazing number of stars myself and two friends witnessed 5 objects moving at an extreme speed that was faster then any jet or plane.  The objects did not have any noticeable blinking lights and had but one bright cream colored light which seemed to have surrounded each of the crafts.  They all headed East from where we were standing and were about 30 seconds behind each other all in the same flight row. The observers, one in the medical field, and the other two are in Marketing and Advertising.;44.1496;-72.6544
