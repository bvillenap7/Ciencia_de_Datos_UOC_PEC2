I was driving south on Pine Street in Burlington, VT just before coming to the Home Ave. intersection at approximately 6:08pm on Friday 12/11/20 and saw a bright light shoot up very quickly into the sky. I thought it was a flare of some kind first, but then it came to a complete stop in the middle of the sky. I observed it for approx 2min and by the time I could park and look up again it was gone. It may have been a drone with a light on it, but it shot up into the sky at a very high rate of speed.;44.4835779816514;-73.2236981651377
