3 fireballs seen over Burlington Vermont;2011-12-19 20:00:00;2-3 minutes;3 fireballs seen over Burlington Vermont Saw two fireball looking circles in the air traveling parallel to each other and slowly northeast. They did not make any sound at all and were very steady. They were orange in color with a slight yellow hue tailing them.   After a minute or so they seemed to go too far in the distance to be seen.   Then right overhead a third fireball came overhead and it seemed a lot closer, though followed the exact same pattern of the other two.  It was orange with a slight yellow hue following it, as if it were fire. It moved slowly in the exact same direction as the other two and made no noise whatsoever.  Then that also disappeared as it moved farther and farther away.  I have never seen anything like it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
