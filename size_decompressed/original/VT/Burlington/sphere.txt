three red orbs views from the ethan allen tower.  ((anonymous report));2018-01-20 01:00:00;30 seconds;three red orbs views from the ethan allen tower was walking with a friend up at the Ethan Allen tower. once we got the top, we both saw three red orbs equally spaced and high flying silently up the lake. maybe a half a mile high. high speed.  I've worked with commercial, private, and military aircraft, this was none of those.no blinking lights, perfectly round, and no noise. eventually flying out of view. unfortunately left my cell phone at the house.;44.4835779816514;-73.2236981651377
