We live in Burlington, VT near the Winooski river. I was inside the house when my son who was outside yelled loudly Dad come outside. I ran out onto the deck to see my son pointing up in the sky what is it? My wife who was in our yard with our dog was looking up in the sky too said It's a UFO. First I thought they were joking until I Looked up and to my amazement saw a flying silver metallic disk navigating in and out of the clouds, it was turning upside down then right side up. I said that's a flying saucer. We had a visual on it for no longer than 1 minute at which time it disappeared in the clouds headed east over Colchester. Too bad I didn't have enough time to get my camcorder. I wasn't at all scared but my heart was beating fast from the experience. I called the airport air-traffic control and reported it to them.;44.4835779816514;-73.2236981651377

A cylinder came over the lake, with lights all the way around it as if the lights were shining through windows.  It also had smaller red lights around the circumference.  It was flying much lower than a usual airplane, and was quiet.    About 10 minutes after this, we saw another flying object taking the same flight pattern.  It had a large bright rectangular light in the front, and was just as low and quiet.  But as it got closer, we could see that the entire underbody was lit up, and that it was more the shape of a normal small plane.  About 15 or 20 minutes later, there was another flyijng craft.  This was an airplane, and was noticeably louder, higher (even though landing), and taking a different flight pattern to reach the airport.;44.4835779816514;-73.2236981651377
