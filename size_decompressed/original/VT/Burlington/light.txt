After I located the origin of the noise below my open window, I raised my eyes to look west, out over Lake Champlain which lies between New York state and Vermont. I saw what appeared to be 2 wingtip landing lights from a heavy jet aircraft, such as a Lockheed C-5A Galaxy, yet steady and no noise was heard. I quickly ascertained that the lights were far too spread apart and far too bright to be aircraft lights. After approx. 10 seconds from initial sighting, the 2 lights began to converge, left light moving toward the right light. At 15 seconds the 2 were very close together and began to head in a northerly direction, left to right from my westward looking viewpoint. However, during the last 5 seconds (approx.), the lights became smaller and smaller, then completely vanished at approx. 20 seconds from initial sighting, both still moving left to right. Detailed Report--This sighting occurred while in my 3rd floor studio apartment in my city of residence, Burlington, VT, on or about May 20, 1998, at 22:40.  I was drawn to my window (western side of building) by some noise on the street below.  About 15 teenagers, were skateboarding southbound on the street I live on, producing a low pitch roaring sound on the pavement below.  After watching them for a couple of minutes, they were nearly out of sight.  I raised my eyes toward the western horizon, looking out over Lake Champlain which lies between New York state and Vermont, I saw 2 steady white lights at an elevation of 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon, and 5 times the brightness of the star Sirius, at approx;44.4835779816514;-73.2236981651377
Bright Orange/Reddish Object moving slowly over Lake Champlain;2009-04-29 21:00:00;10 min;Bright Orange/Reddish Object moving slowly over Lake Champlain I went outside and overheard my neighbor telling someone on the phone that she was looking at a UFO.  I looked up and saw it out over Lake Champlain.   It was very bright, orange/reddish (the color of a flame), a little bigger than a star, and was moving slowly.  First it went north, and then it turned south.  It was at about a 40 degree angle from my viewpoint.   It appeared to flicker and also fluctuated in intensity (sometimes dimmer and sometimes brighter).  I called my friend who lives about a mile or so away, and she went outside and could see it as well.   It did not have blinking lights or white headlight type lights and thus did not resemble a plane (in fact, there was a plane near it in the sky for comparison, but it was impossible to tell how far away the plane or the object were from myself and/or from each other).  Eventually the object moved south and I could no longer see it because the trees in the yard were blocking my view.;44.4835779816514;-73.2236981651377
Formation of flying incandescent dots sighted;2011-06-17 23:45:00;5 minutes;Formation of flying candescent dots sighted From a central Burlington city park, I sighted a formation of four candescent dots in a linear formation.   They appeared below cloud level on an overcast night.  The incandescent dots appeared flying from south/East to north/East at a steady speed.   Each dot suddenly disappeared at the same location, possibly going into the cloud cover eastward.   The dots were clearly discernable and had the candescent look of sparks.  The final object slowed down or hovered, and appeared closer.  I could barely make out that it resembled Saturn to the naked eye or with binoculars.  It seemed to have a characteristic that looked like a disc around a globe.  It also suddenly faded into the east.   As the dots appeared smaller untill disappearing they appeared reddish.  The dots appeared to be miles apart. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.4835779816514;-73.2236981651377
2 bright orange balls of light in sraight perpendicular formation moving away at great speed.;2012-01-01 00:15:00;2 minutes;2 bright orange balls of light in sraight perpendicular formation moving away at great speed. I went to bed around 10:30 New Years Eve and spent a couple of hours trying to get to sleep. At about 12:15 amon Jan 1st, I glanced out mysouth-facing bedroom window to see 2 round orange balls about a foot apart in a straight perpendicular line. I could not figure out what I was looking at....perhaps some reflection of the streetlights? As I moved to look better, they appeared smaller but still in same formation.  I thought maybe they were large orange planets in the sky in a formation and came to ask my son-in-law if any planets/stars were sposed to be in alignment that night, New Years Eve.  He and my daughter then came to see and as we watched, these orange balls of light became smaller and smaller very quickly as they seemed to move away and eventually they seemed to come together and disappear.  It was a very short time beqween when they appeared tennis-ball-sized right out my window to disappearing  higher in the sky.  I am a 51 year old mother.  Nev! er saw anything like this before.;44.4835779816514;-73.2236981651377
2 orange lights moveing northward viewed by 3 residents;2012-01-01 00:15:00;5;2 orange lights moveing northward viewed by 3 residents There were two orange lights about 70 degrees from the horizon when we first noticed them. It was my mother-in-law, my sister-in-law, and myself. We were at the window looking to see if it was snowing when we noticed the lights.  We were inside looking northward.  A little beyond us are 2 small trees and another house.  When we first noticed them we thought they were planets due to their stationary look, however it was too cloudy to see any stars behind the lights. The weather was around 32 degrees and a bit cloudy. What makes this unusual, however, is their sudden movement northward.  The lights appeared to move independently of each other.  They would move far apart and then one circle back on the other.  The pattern was non-sequential and lacked any distinguishing pattern of movement. Then would speed up and slow down as well. Eventually, the lights rose above the clouds in a circular pattern and vanished from sight.;44.4835779816514;-73.2236981651377
Red orbs.;2013-10-08 02:00:00;30 seconds;On my way to work at 2am and saw 2 bright red orbs in the sky a few miles from the airport.  One was higher then the other one but they were pretty close together.  The lower orb had a little bit of white light showing on the right side of it barely visible.  These werent aircraft lights and to be sure I checked my flight radar app on my phone to see if there was any known commercial air traffic in the area and there was none.;44.4835779816514;-73.2236981651377

Almost as soon as i looked at it, it began to get brighter and brighter white.   It than started to move directly towards earth, i noticed trails as if it was a comet heading directly towards me but very far off.  It than seemed to loose the trails behind it came to a stop.   Then it shot northward and dimmed slowly as it streak across the sky and out of view.   Very scarey and makes my hair stand up thinking about it.;44.4835779816514;-73.2236981651377

Three groups of istant successive fast moving lights in formation traveling from E to W.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));2019-05-27 22:15:00;5 minutes;Three groups of istant successive fast moving lights in formation traveling from east to west, each light flashing one after the other. On the night of May 26th at 10:15-10:30pm, over Burlington, I saw a string of lights high up in the atmosphere. At first, when I saw only one light, I thought it could be a satellite (it looked like a distant star), but it was going too fast. But then I saw another, then three, then four lights in a row information, flying from east to west. The first one would flash, then the second, then the third, etc. I followed them with my eyes until they were out of sight. Then another formation started from the exact same location, doing the same thing. And it happened a third time. It took about five minutes for the whole show. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.
