Large Black Triangle High Altitude.;2013-11-24 22:10:00;1 minute;Large Black Triangle High Altitude. Black Triangle, no indicator lights.  Traveling at high altitude.   Object was darker than night sky and visibly blocked out individual bright stars as it passed over head.  In comparison to a large passenger airplane traveling at 50,000ft it was about a half inch nose to tail end.  Which would make it much larger than a 737.  Traveling two to three times faster than a passenger aircraft crosses the sky.   I grew up near Burlington International Airport I have had 29 years of observing planes flying over head.;44.4835779816514;-73.2236981651377
I noticed several small white lights, all in equal luminosity.    ((Starlink satellites??));2020-03-01 22:30:00;10 seconds;Driving on route 279 north in Vermont on 3/1/2020 at about 21:30 I noticed several small white lights, all in equal luminosity, in mid sky.  At first they resembled several aircraft in an airport landing pattern. I  then realized there were 8 uniform lights in a huge triangle.  They were all moving at the same speed and were in perfect alignment.  I  watched for about 6 seconds and saw 7 of the lights went dark at exactly the same time.  About one second later the 8th light went dark.  The sky was clear and there were no clouds in the sky.  I donâ€™t know how far the lights were away from my car, but judging from the spacing the object was very large.   As a former pilot, I tend to think these lights not flares, helicopters, military craft  or any aircraft I can think of. The shape resembled that of the Stealth fighter, only much much larger.  Thank you for your time and interest.;44.4835779816514;-73.2236981651377
