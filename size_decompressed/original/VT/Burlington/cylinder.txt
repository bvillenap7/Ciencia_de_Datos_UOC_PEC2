a self propelled pentoid or cylinder shaped object that looked light brownish and it moved like a plane.;2002-08-08 13:15:00;a minute at least;a self propelled pentoid or cylinder shaped object that looked light brownish and it moved like a plane. I spotted the object out my window at work and called one of my co-workers over to view it.  We definetely see alot of airplanes from this window as the airport is not far away.  I saw the shape as somewhat pentoid but 3 dimensional with a small blinking light.  My co-worker described it as a cylinder with definete edges and again with the light.  We called a third person over to see it but she could not spot it as it was disappearing from our view and probably going higher. I thought it was the color of a paper bag the light was white and intense.  The wind is blowing in that direction today but to us it looked self propelled as it left our field of vision fairly rapidly. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness and found her to be exceptionally sincere and lucid in her description of the event.  Daytime sighting.  PD));44.4835779816514;-73.2236981651377
