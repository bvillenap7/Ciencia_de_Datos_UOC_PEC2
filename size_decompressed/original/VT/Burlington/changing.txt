three sightings, one time very close, second time boomerang shape very high up, third time triangle shape two witnesses, burlington vt;2004-10-27 09:45:00;5 seconds, 3 times;three sightings, one time very close, second time boomerang shape very high up, third time triangle shape two witnesses, burlington vt So we were outside, watching the skies for the lunar eclipse, and then not near the moon, we spot a very dark massive object flying quite low over our heads, maybe 200 feet, it was like a sideways mcdonalds arch but the arched parts were wider angles - hard to describe, but no lights at all. moving pretty slowly too however it was making no noise at all, very creepy and then it disappeared into the sky. The second sighting was 20 minutes later, it was much much higher up in the sky, we saw it in a boomerang shape, again no lights no sound, it just seemed like the city lights were making it visible and there was no top light due to the lunar eclipse. it seemed to have a dot on each wing. The third sighting was about 30 minutes after that and it was in a triangle shape, flew over our heads and then did this amazing maneuver in the sky, it turned while the dots rotated, a bit mind blowing to see an object do this. then again it faded into the night.;44.4835779816514;-73.2236981651377
One Orb splits into Four. One massive object? or four small orbs traveling in unison?;2013-11-24 22:11:00;30 seconds;One Orb splits into Four.  One massive object? or four small orbs traveling in unison? After witnessing a blacked out triangle cross the entire sky in less than a minute.  My eyes went back to the right of my vision (North).  Literally out of nowhere, a ball of light appeared in the distance.  (Almost like I watched it form into creation) than it started moving fast to the left.  Split into four individual smaller lights.  Not much brighter than the stars that make up Orion's belt.  Appeared to be traveling in unison, at an angle than seemed to do a banking maneuver to the objects right.  My direct front.  Which is West over upstate NY.   Then the lights faded out.  If this was a single object it was massive.  After the lights split into four and they stopped expanding there was about an inch gap in between each light and Lake Champlain is about 900 yards from my position.  If it was over the middle of the lake, it would be easily three C-37s wingtip to wingtip in width when it banked away over NY.  The object didn't have a form to it though.  Which is why I'm confused as to if I saw one or four objects come from the starting orb.   About five minute after known aircraft w/ flashing indicator lights were seen for the rest of the night over the mountains in NY and following the path direction the large object had followed.;44.4835779816514;-73.2236981651377
