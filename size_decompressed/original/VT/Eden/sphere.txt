On Saturday, August 15th, at approximately 9:10pm, from the NW where the Big Dipper was I noticed a bright light coming toward me from the two bottom stars that make up the base of the Big Dipper Pot (hope that makes sense).  The object was bright like a massive orb with no sound whatsoever.   I know it wasn't a plane cause a few flew over with their standard red and green lights and the sound of jet engines.  Jola (my wife) was inside the house and I was calling out for her, but for some reason she couldn't hear me even though most of the windows were open.   I ran inside to call her as a witness calling out to her and she still didn't hear me (almost like my voice was muted).  I grabbed her camera and snapped these photos.  I'm not tech savvy, so I don't know how to zoom them in.  You'll have to do it manually. This is exactly what I've been seeing for the last couple of years and I FINALLY got pictures!!!  I saw a large bright orb but the pictures tell another story almost like it was alive!!  I would say it was approximately 5,000 to 8,000 feet above.  Even though I zoomed in the pictures still came back small.  I am sending pictures via email.;44.7354;-72.5879
