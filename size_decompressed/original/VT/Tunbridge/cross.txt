Multiple objects in sky that changed color and moved in a different manner than any satellite.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible stars?  PD));2012-09-23 21:00:00;3 hours;Multiple objects in sky that changed color and moved in a different manner than any satellite. Started with one object that was moving like a helicopter would.  In all directions.  The center changed colors.  Blue, green, red, yellow.  My daughter who is five and my husband and I all saw it through our binoculars.  More appeared after a while.  Some would just hover and others moved.  They would blink, get bright and then fade.  They almost looked like a line of windows with the colorful changing light thing in the middle.  The middle would make a triangle at some point and other shapes.  VERY COOL!!!..and strange.  Never seen anything like this.  Tried to get a video but the camera wouldn't pick up any stars in the sky....only black.;43.913;-72.4791
