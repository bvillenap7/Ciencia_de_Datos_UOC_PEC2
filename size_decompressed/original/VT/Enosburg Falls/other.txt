4 red lights in the sky.;2015-07-06 22:10:00;5 minutes;4 Red lights in the sky. I went to my kitchen sink and saw two round red lights side by side a small distance from each other in the sky that came from south east direction from just behind a tree in my back yard.  I told my husband to come see them then two more appeared from the same direction but not together as the first two had been.  My first thought was those lanterns that you see floating sometimes in the summer evenings, but these were going too fast to be that.  They just kept on floating out of site towards Montgomery, Vermont.;44.8938;-72.789
