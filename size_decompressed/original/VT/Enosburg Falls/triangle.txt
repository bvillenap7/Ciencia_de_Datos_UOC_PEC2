Silent Dark V shape outlined with small white lights;2001-08-15 21:45:00;5 Minutes;Silent Dark V shape outlined with small white lights The sighting took place on an open hilltop in a dark, quiet rural area.   I looked up on a clear starry evening and a movement caught my attention.  At first I thought it was a plane of some sort, but something about the size and movement didn’t make sense compared to a normal aircraft.   I also realized there was no sound which I would expect from a jet of such size flying so close: it appeared about the size of two fingers held at arm’s length.   I stood still for several minutes watching and waiting to hear the roar of jet engines, but nothing.  The speed seemed peculiar as well, at first going very slowly overhead, then progressively faster as it got toward the tree line. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date is approximate.
