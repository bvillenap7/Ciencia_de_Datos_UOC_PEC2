Teardrop contrail seen in west southwest sky in Vermont  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the object was a contrail.  PD));2004-10-07 18:45:00;5 mins;Teardrop contrail seen in west southwest sky in Vermont Headed north on Route 89 in Vermont between Swanton and Highgate I noticed an object in the western sky, slightly south of west, just above the treeline, not sure of the exact distance, but it appeared to be very far away / high up.  Appeared to be an object entering the atmosphere, producing a teardrop shaped contrail that dissipated a short ways behind the object.  Object appeared to be entering at approximately a 30-35 degree angle, unable to determine velocity.  About 10 minutes later, the object disappeared behind the trees and I was unable to track it.
