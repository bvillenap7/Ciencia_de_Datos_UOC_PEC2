My father saw the craft outside and I ran out.  It was huge and dark colored it looked rectangular but round and long.  It had two bright lights that changed from red to yellow.  It was about ten times the size of a plane and was low right above the trees.   It was hovering for a while and then slowly turned and lowered.  It was soundless.  It looked as if it was landing and the two front lights looked about 6-10 inches apart.  The ship looked somewhat transparent in spots.   After the craft dissapeared we noticed two other planes that looked like human planes flying near it.  We don't know if those planes saw the aircraft.   I have seen this craft once before but this time it was much longer and closer.  Both in Starksboro Vermont.   Once on 116 rd and this time right outside my house on mason hill rd.;44.2274;-73.0207
