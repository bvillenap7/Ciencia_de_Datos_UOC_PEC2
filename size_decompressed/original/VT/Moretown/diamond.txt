As I approached Moretown, heading north on Rte 100 I saw a yellowish light in the distance.  At first I thought it was the top of a radio tower on top of a hill somewhere.   As I got closer to town I realized there is no tower anywhere close by.  I was getting closer to the object and I could make it out better as I kept driving.  When I got into Moretown, I could tell that the object was moving very slowly through the sky, only about 300 feet above the ground.   I started driving up the hill to my home and when I got to the top and the view wasn't obscured by trees I pulled over and opened my window.  The object was flying very low yet I could not hear any noise.   The shape was almost diamond-like or trapezoidal.  It almost looked like 2 helicopters were flying one in front of the other, really close, but I would have been able to hear them so close to the ground.  It was a big dark object but it had several yellow lights underneath and also a red light.  It kept flying and eventually flew over the area of my car.   Soon I lost sight of it over the trees.   I got home and searched online and someone reported a similar sighting about a couple days ago over interstate 91.;44.2625;-72.7459
