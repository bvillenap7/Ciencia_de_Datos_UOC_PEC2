Two Silent Bright Lights Move In Formation;2011-09-25 20:55:00;2 min;Two Silent Bri ght Lights Move In Formation It was two, bright, orange-ish white lights spaced an equal and close distance apart in horizontal line. It was traveling west-east from Hyde Park to North Hyde Park It was perhaps just a few miles (if that) away from us and was quite low in the sky. The lights were traveling slowly. It turned north heading in our direction (towards Johnson) and then slowly turned to the south at which time the two lights began to get closer to each other until they become one and dipped below the tree line. It was strange because for being so close and so low in the sky there was no noise AT ALL!  From reading another Johnson post, I would like to add that this object(s) was seen from the top of the hill near the reindeer farm.
