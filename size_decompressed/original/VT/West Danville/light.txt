3 faint objects in wedge formation travelling very fast, high  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of U. S. Navy NOSS satelites.));2000-08-10 22:30:00;3 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness may have observed the three satellites frequently reported to NUFORC, which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy NOSS satellite surveillance system.  PD)) Three faint objects in wedge formation travelling very fast and very high I stepped out to smoke a cigarette, like I have done many times before.  I was living in a rural area, and light pollution was almost non-existant.  It was a crisp and clear night.  I was looking at the sky, as I always did, spotting satellites and meteors, etc.  I then saw three very faint lights, in a isosoles triangular formation, travelling from north to south.  There was one light in the front of the formation, and the other two were behind to left and right.  They travelled in a straight line like satellites do, and made no sound.  Their brightness remained the same the entire time I saw them.  The strange thing was that at certain times, one of the two trailing objects would start to lag behind the other two, and then suddenly accellerate to catch up, to make the formation a perfect isosoles triangle again.  I was unable to tell the altitude of the objects, but it seemed they were in earth orbit.  If they were in orbit, the three objects would have been separated by several miles between each other.  I thought they might have been fighter jets from Plattsburg AFB, and if they were they would have been flying very high.  However, they covered the sky from horizon to horizon in about 3 minutes, and as I said they were very faint.  My second guess was they were maybe SDI satellites, due to the triangular formation, maybe used to triangulate an incoming warhead?  I thought I would report this anyway, hoping maybe someone could answer this.;44.444;-72.2236
