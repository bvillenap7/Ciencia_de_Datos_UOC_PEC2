Unexplained lights on otherwise dark road;2015-01-21 18:30:00;1 minute;Unexplained lights on otherwise dark road I was driving on Route 15 in West Danville, VT, headed east going between 45-55 mph due to road conditions.  I have driven this road thousands of times, so I know it pretty well.   I noticed some large yellow lights just over the tops of the trees (it was hard to say how close or far they were from me due to the darkness) and thought it strange as there are no street lights or tall towers in this area that would warrant lights on the tops.   I passed to a section of the road where the trees were a bit thinner and saw three lights with another blinking on.  The three lights were in a rough triangular arrangement, with the fourth slightly lower and to the left of the group.   I drove by another clump of trees and could not see them any more.  The section of the road that I was on does not curve significantly enough for me to lose the lights due to the road.   I have no explanation for these lights.   The sky tonight was relatively clear (I could see stars) and the moon is almost full. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
