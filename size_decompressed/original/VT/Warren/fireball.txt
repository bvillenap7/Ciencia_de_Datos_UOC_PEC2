meteor like object flashes upon impact with earth;2000-12-26 18:30:00;5 seconds;meteor like object flashes upon impact with earth I was driving on Route 89 North, around Exit 13, at 6:30 PM on 12/26/2000.  I saw a glowing object move into my field of vision from the right (east).  It seemed to catch fire and glow very brightly, while rapidley moving down and to the left (west).  The object had a tail of flames (like a meteor).  The object moved over the tree line to the left and out of my field of vision.  There then was a green flash, apparently caused when the object impacted the earth. ((NUFORC Note  Please see other reports of same event.  PD));44.1083;-72.8575
