Well,  a frind and I were sledding in my back yard with a clear view of the ski area,  just above the mountain about 1k off the top was a very bright light.  No wings no exaust and no propeller.  It stayed still for about 10 sec and then drifted behind the mountain so we couldn't see it anymore.   It looked like a mirror was in the air reflecting light straght at us.  Very Bright.  Total view time abot 30 sec then it was gone.  I would have thought that people @ the ski area would have seen it too because that is what time the mountain closed.  Lots of people getting in their cars.  but so far I guess it was just us that saw it.  I have spent a lot of time up on my hill and have seen all kinds of planes choppers and gliders,  This was none of the above.;44.1083;-72.8575
