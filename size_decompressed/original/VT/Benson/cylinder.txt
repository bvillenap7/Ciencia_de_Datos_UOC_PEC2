April 17,2014 @ 9:50pm I noticed a bright object in the sky, it was green, red and yellow.   The object kept changing back and forth with different colors.  It had looked like a circle, ad it was moving around.   It also looked like something was coming out of it my fianc√© and I had watched this for about 15- 20 minutes, I took several pictures before it vanished.   My dog was also growling and whining, and ran into the back bedroom.   The photos I took are original with no editing or cropping, also if you zoom in you can see these red objects in the photos as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star?  PD));43.6848;-73.2953
