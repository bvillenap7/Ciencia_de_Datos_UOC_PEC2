Multiple orange glow with a dark.;2017-06-27 21:45:00;15 minutes;Multiple orange glow with a dark. I saw these out in the distance.  I see a dark floater to my right and they make way over my house.   I go outside and listen and hear nothing.  Out in the distance, I see an orange glow.  Way out in farm land.  I assume must be a big fire maybe embers from it.   Then it rises and floats over my house I recorded it bad footage but got it and you can see it pass a start as it moves, then gone.;43.6848;-73.2953
