this was not a plane,hellicopter,star or the moon;2006-01-01 21:30:00;unknown;this was not a plane,hellicopter,star or the moon driving home from springfield MA i was 91 north in vermont at about 9:30pm, when i saw a brightly lite object in the sky.what caught my attention was the fact that it was a clowdy night and the stars were not visible.i took the brattleboro exit of 91 to get a better look.  i pulled into a plaza and got out my video camera.i zoomed right in on it and it had a interesting shape to it.it looked like an X with a ball on top. it even changed it's shape to a orange ball and then back to the x.i wintnessed it for about 10 min. before i left and got back to the highway.as i was on 91n i seen it dissapear behind the clowds.i don't know what it was,but i know what it wasn't. jason from williston,vt;42.8575;-72.594
