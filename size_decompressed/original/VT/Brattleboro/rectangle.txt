Bright lights hovering low in west brattleboro/marlboro.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus?  PD));2013-10-22 19:08:00;30 minutes;bright lights hovering low in west brattleboro/marlboro I was observing the sky from my backyard in my usual manner when I saw a very bright light which I knew to be out of place.  I looked at to see if it may be an errant airplane.  The object seemed to remain stationary, changing position only slightly but with no regularity.   The light was low and to the west from my position in West Brattleboro, seemingly over Marlboro or the Sunset Lake Area.  I showed my child's nurse with a binocular and she confirmed my observation and stated she had seen a similar object a few days previous.   This object is still present as I write this report and I can see it out my window in the sky it is a white light with maybe some coloring on the outside edges orange.  And I think I just saw a smaller object circle it and disappear near it. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD));42.8575;-72.594
