Bright White Solid Light Observed by Police Officer in sky over southern Vermont USA ((NUFORC Note:  ISS confirmed.  PD));2012-02-01 04:45:00;20 Seconds;Bright White Solid Light Observed by Police Officer in sky over southern Vermont USA I AM A 20 YEAR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.  I KNOW WHAT I SAW. I was walking my Canine at 0445 Hrs. In the town of Brattleboro, VT.  I look to the sky frequently as the lack of ambient light allows seeing falling stars very often.  As I looked into the sky A VERY BRIGHT WHILE LIGHT MOVED ACROSS THE SKY AT A FAST BUT STEADY SPEED.  IT WAS WHITE, NO OTHER COLORS, NO FLASHING AND JUST VERY BRIGHT WHITE.  I observed it for a period of 20 seconds and then, as it moved Northwest to Southeast the sky above had cloud cover and precluded me from observing it any further.  I have been looking at the night sky for 50 years . . . No one No one is going to tell me that I saw anything other than what I believe I saw.  It was not the belly of a chrome jumbo jet flying so incredibly high that the sun in Australia was lighting it up from 3/4's of the way around the world.  It was NOT a weather balloon with a 98 million candle power light bulb.  Save all the hokie pokie stuff.  I know what I saw and that's final.
