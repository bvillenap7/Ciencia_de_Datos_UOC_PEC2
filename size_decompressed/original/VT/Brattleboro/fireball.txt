Me and a friend saw them as we were going to go play in the snow with a car pull donuts and stuff.  Our first thought was that they were lanterns falling back to earth but then they just stopped.  Flew at us not hostile like at all just flew over head and then turned back to the town note there a river that runs between us and the town at least 150 feet wide so there's wind always blowing at the town they stopped at the edge of the opposite bank of us turned in to the wind flew at least 100 miles an hour for about 50 yards then stopped abruptly came together and in a blink of an eye they shot back up into the sky and were gone.
