UFO in background atop Black Mountain in Vermont;2012-05-06 12:45:00;?;UFO in background atop Black Mountain in Vermont We did not witness the UFO in person.  My girlfriend and I asked a stranger to take a picture of us on top of Black Mountain in Brattleboro, VT.  It wasn't until we later inspected the photograph that we noticed something strange in one of the photos.  In total there were three photos taken in quick sequence.  In one of the photos, you can see a very bizarre anomoly above my head.  It's difficult to discern what it is, but it certainly resembles some kind of flying craft.  There were a lot of black flies up there, and my girlfriend says maybe it was a fly in front of the camera.   I think that explanation is plausible, but the UFO does not resemble a fly in any way that I can tell.  Look for yourself, here is a zoomed up picture that I swear to you, is not doctored.  I have the original file, but it contains my girlfriend and I, and I'm not so sure I want to disclose our identities to someone I don't know... ((NUFORC Note:  We cannot identify the object, but the lack of symmetry to the object suggests to us that it probably is not a genuine UFO.  We suspect that it may be a bird, with its wings folded, while in flight, but we cannot be certain.  PD));42.8575;-72.594
