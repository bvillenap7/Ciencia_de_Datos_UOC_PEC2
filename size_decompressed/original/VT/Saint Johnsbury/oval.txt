A greenish fireball shot across the sky.;2007-03-25 22:15:00;1-2 seconds;A greenish fireball shot across the sky. In St. Johnsbury, Vermont, on March 25 at approximately 10:15 PM I had just gone to bed and turned the bedroom light out.  I was facing the bedroom window that faces the east.  The blind was up.  I saw a green fireball streak the window moving east but slightly northeast.  The fireball was in a slight oval shape with the front point a light green, the middle section darker Kelly green, and the back tail, orange yellow.  It moved across the window within 1-2 seconds and disappeared behind trees while never losing altitude.  My feeling was that it was both very large and high up, out of the earthâ€™s atmosphere, or about the size of a small plane and flying at a higher altitude a small plane would fly at.  It was really hard to say how high it was because it was dark and it moved so fast.  I immediately wondered if it was northern lights or a meteor.;44.4224;-72.0118
