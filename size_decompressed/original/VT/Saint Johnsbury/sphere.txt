It was traveling from east to west.  Then 5 mins later, one (1) other of the same object came behind.  They were both round and bright white with no sound what so ever.  And never blinked. We both had also witnessed the same object back in June of 2015 as well.  But this one was coming from the north going south.;44.4224;-72.0118
