Driving south on 91 just after exit 22 for St. Johnsbury I saw 4 reddish orange lights appeared one by one, then disappeared one by one.  Appeared to be headed northeast. Very short duration.  Each light was on for maybe 1 second before disappearing. Very large. Seemed to be quite close.  Equivalent to the size of the planet venus as seen on the horizon that night.;44.4224;-72.0118
