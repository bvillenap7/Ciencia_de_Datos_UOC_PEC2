It was just before 7:00 pm as I was headed for a library board meeting in my town.  I turned out of my driveway onto our dirt road and saw what I thought was a low-flying plane flying directly over our road which is straight.   I thought this strange and when it continued toward my flying low over the road, I got out of my car to watch it ffly over me.  I still thought it was an aircraft of some sort.  When it was pretty much directly overhead, I saw that it was not a plane at all, but an oval shaped craft with lights on the bottom.   I felt I was seeing something out of the ordinary and had a horrible thought that I might be somehow beamed up.  I jumped back in my car sped to the library.   The craft continued flying low but made a 90 degree angle, which I am sorry to say I did not see, but the craft was headed in a perpendicular direction when I finally looked.  I cannot remember if I heard any sound coming from the craft or not.  I am a primary school teacher and not prone to flights of fancy.  When I got to the library, I told them that I thought I had almost been abducted by aliens and they good-naturedly laughed.   The story came up at a family party this weekend with people who were encouraging.  This is the reason it has taken so long for me to report.;44.8353;-73.2778
