A formation of lights breaking the sound barrier and doing odd manuevers.;2009-05-21 22:00:00;10 min;A formation of lights breaking the sound barrier and doing odd manuevers. I was awaken by a loud rumble. I assumed a plane may be in distress.  I immediately looked outside and saw what appeared to be the lights of a low flying commercial airliner flying directly toward the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant, less than 1 mile from our house.  Then, it split into three separate lights, all of red, doing manuevers that airplanes aren't capable of. They all appeared to be breaking the sound barrier.  They continued, after doing manuevers, to travel east toward Hinsdale, NH.  Within minutes, there where several airplanes flying that same direction.  I, as a volunteer firefighter, turned on my radio and listened for an extensive period and never heard any reports of any crashes in our area.;42.756;-72.506
