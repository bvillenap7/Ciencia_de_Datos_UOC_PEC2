watching and studying a failing engine on a ufo;2007-02-28 13:30:00;10-15 minutes;watching and studying a failing engine on a ufo My friend and I were sitting out on the back porch it was the first sunny day we have had in awhile. That was when she pointed up to the sky and we saw then what looked like a silver ball floating down from the sky like a leaf. She ran inside to get binaculers and the ship turned over with the binaculars we could see so much of this equipment...The metal was very shiney and smooth as if molded..we could see what looked like 5 or 6 engines all spinning in different directions in side those tubes were more tubes spinning in the opposite direction as the big tube..instead of fire coming out of these it looked more like lava or coals being sucked into these tubes.... the engines or what not seemed to stop spinning from the inside tube first then the outside one would stop. it then again appeared to turn and you could see the saucer shape..it fell behind 2 mountians the smoke trail was gone within 10 minutes..
