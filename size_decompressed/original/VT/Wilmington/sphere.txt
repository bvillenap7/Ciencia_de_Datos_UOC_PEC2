Glowing sphere, hovering and then dissipating in close proximity to human beings;2012-06-20 22:00:00;1 minute;Glowing sphere, hovering and then dissipating in close proximity to human beings A single craft was observed when I was sitting in a field outside my friends home.   We were playing a game of man hunt and my partner and I decided to hide in the field directly in front of his house.  As we were sitting in the tall grass, a bright blue glowing sphere about a cubic foot in size appeared about 10 feet in front of us and 40 feet above the ground.   This sphere emitted a low hum, that seemed to shush the atmosphere around it,  The owls, the crickets, and the frogs that had all been previously making noises stopped abruptly as soon as the sphere appeared.  The sphere hovered for a mere 3 seconds and then quickly dropped 20 feet and dissipated into nothing 20 feet above the ground.  My friend and I were in complete shock and have no idea what we have seen, but the owner of the home we were at says that once or twice a year the same spheres appear, hovering and then dissipating.
