Oval spacecraft seeing at night over Vermont mountains. First thought as an antenna, too high above surface to fit in.  Stationary white light, changing to red.  Suddenly became 2 lights flickering between red and blue, still, as watched from a cliff, started to move slowly to the right as if scanning a place until it disappear fast in the night sky.;44.0303;-72.5974
