Observed a round object with a red dot in the middle proceed across the sky in a straight line.  It did not appear to be an aircraft.  It's altitude did not appear to change.  We noticed it on the horizon and it seemed to travel from the west to the north.  I've never seen anything like it.  I've read about weather ballons with lights, but I assume those would change altitude, right?  My girlfriend, myself and two friends were watching fireworks in our neighborhood, it was before the show at dusk.  Unknown if anyone else saw it, there were hundreds of people in the area.  My friend took a video, I've been trying to get him off his butt to transfer it to the computer.;44.8098708333333;-73.0914208333333
