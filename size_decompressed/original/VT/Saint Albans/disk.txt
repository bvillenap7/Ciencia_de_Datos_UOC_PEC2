COMPLETE VISUAL SIGHTING.;2013-05-06 22:00:00;2 minutes;COMPLETE VISUAL SIGHTING Observer 1 pointed out a cigar shaped light moving/floating at a consistent speed at what seemed to be a low altitude.   As we viewed the light move in front of us across the sky, our visual perspective changed and the light curved into a flying crescent.  It seemed to move IN A COMPLETE STRAIGHT LINE, meaning the light/object did not appear to visually come off the horizon and it disappeared straight into space;44.8098708333333;-73.0914208333333
