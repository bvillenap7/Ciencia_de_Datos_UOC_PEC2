I was sitting out with my telescope.  These orange craft approached from the north one at a time came into view.  No sound at all. We have border patrol helecopters and planes that I see (I go out almost every clear night, we are near the Canadien border) but these were different. They were bright orange, Halloween orange.  Going slow. They were swept back triangular in shape.  Each one crossed to the south and then at a point nearly out of my sight they flashed, very bright.  Each one did this at the same point in the sky.  I couldn't quite see if they disappeared, but that is what I thought, or changed.  Trees blocked the view, but it was a very bright flash each time.;44.8098708333333;-73.0914208333333
