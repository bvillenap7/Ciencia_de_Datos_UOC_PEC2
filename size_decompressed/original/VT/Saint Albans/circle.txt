2 bright orange orbs silently flying through the sky.;2013-11-14 18:45:00;5 minutes;2 bright orange orbs silently flying through the sky. Two bright orange orbs larger and brighter then the biggest star in the sky were flying over St. Albans city.  They were traveling side by side then changed directing abruptly and continued their flight one in front of the other.  There were moving slightly faster and at a lower altitude then the average air plain we usually see in our area.  After several moments the two orbs once again abruptly changed direction, this time flying straight up into the sky.   In a matter of seconds they disappeared one directly after the other.  We could visibly see them fade.  They became smaller and dimmer before completely disappearing into the night sky.  There was complete silence in the sky.  These orbs made no sound.;44.8098708333333;-73.0914208333333
