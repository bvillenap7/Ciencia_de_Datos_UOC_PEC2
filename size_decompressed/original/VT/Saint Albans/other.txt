Driving to dinner.  Crossing bridge to Alburg, saw 5 orange colored lights over the tree line in a backwards “L” shape.  Directly over tree line in line of sight crossing the bridge.  Not normal lights for that area, know it wasn’t a plane going to the local airport. 6:30 12/2/17 Rte. 7 St Albans, VT.  Driving home from dinner, we saw same, or similar, 5 orange lights over fields.  We watched these 5 lights for a few miles heading north towards Swanton.   We turned onto Comstock Road and stopped by the railroad tracks.  We got out of the car and watched these 5 lights change from an “L” shape to a back semi-circle to a line.  We watched as the 5 passed over us.  One seemed to fall, but not by gravity, but a calculated descent.   The “4th in line, stopped, then “caught up” to the other 3.  We watched the first three lights fly over us and climb and eventually disappear.  The 4th followed the same route.  There was no noise, as an airplane would emit.  There were no blinking lights, the normal red/green.  As we turned onto County Road and saw a light like the ones in the sky, in the field in front of the tree line, we watched it “bounce” along the field.;44.8098708333333;-73.0914208333333
