Looking up in the NW sky we first saw one very bright star that appeared to be flickering.  Upon further inspection with binoculars, we saw that it had Blue, Red, (?Green), and yellow blinking lights.  Looks as though the yellow - white light is in the middle and the other colored lights surround it.  Examing the rest of the sky we see 3 more of the same.  One in the NW sky, one in the NE sky, one in the SE, one in the SW.  The moon is almost full.  There are a lot of planes as well in the sky tonight, but these lights are stationary, and they don't blink like an airplane. I saw the first one at about 20:30. Now at 22:42 all 4 are still in the sky. What are they?;44.9647;-72.9008
