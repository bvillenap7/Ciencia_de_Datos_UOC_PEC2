They began to shoot through the woods, flicker, change colors but the light always stayed projecting towards us.   The light intensity was unlike anything I know of, many other small blue and red lights were scattered across the mountain as well.  We watched it shift from one set of peaks to another at an unbelievable rate.   As we looked in the sky above we noticed another bright light and it began to shift in zig zags and circles hovering around the night sky, as we looked around we could see a ring of these blue lights that all were moving in the same behavior unlike any of the other stars, or shooting stars in the sky.   As we watched them, a bright orange orb appears from the ridge on our property and followed the tree tops till the end of the ridge, then zig zagged and shot off into the night sky.;43.4314;-73.2035
