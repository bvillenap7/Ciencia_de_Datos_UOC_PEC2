I was so excited so i called my sister 30 miles away. and before I could say anything,she interupted me about a big white light in the sky. My daughter and her boyfriend told us they were the same lights they saw 2 nights before near our home but not in the same area. I didnt pay much attention to her the other night, because I believe in ufos but still am a little skepticle when hearing from a teenager.Not anymore!!!!;44.0039;-72.1436
