We where in parking lot of the Country Market, near old Fort Ethan Allen, Colchester.  Object was big and very fast. Left no smoke trail. Stange black thing with green glow:  very high and fast coming out of southwest over White Face Mtn., and New York side of Lake Champlain.  Last seen passing to Northeast.  We where standing in parking lot just out side of the Flag Store on Essex, side of Road.  My younger son, 19 and in college was remarking to other kids to look at what was coming.  He thinks it was strange because it was changing speed and jumping all over the place.  We had two Japanese students with us and they also say it was strange.  We had radio and car running and both acted up for about ten seconds:  radio went dead and car stalled.;44.5355;-73.1937078947369

While delivering newspapers about 6:00 am, I saw in the Northern sky what appeared to be three bright stars fairly close together.I then observed one of the lights starting to movein a perfectly stright and steady line to the East. The light had about the same intensity as the other actual stars.In the early morning light,I could faintly make out what looked like some sort of craft behind and to the right of it.( The light actually looked like an aircraft headlight but the light was emitting from it's side rather than the front.)Therewas also no sound or flashing lights as are typical on most aircraft.The craft continued on a perfectly straight course to the East and off into the horizon.;44.5355;-73.1937078947369

At approximately 23:30 on 4/4/20, I proceeded outside to walk my two dogs.  While out in the yard, facing East, I noticed a very bright Orange/Red glowing object in the sky, traveling North to South. I observed the Light for a moment before I realized that it was NOT a Plane or Helicopter.  I hooked my dog to the gate of my fence and went back into the house to retrieve my Wife to both verify what I was observing and to allow her to observe something I felt was highly unusual..;44.5355;-73.1937078947369
