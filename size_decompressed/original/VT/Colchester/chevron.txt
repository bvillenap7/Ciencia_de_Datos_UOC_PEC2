Orange light arch in Vermont.;2011-05-06 23:20:00;3 minutes;Orange light arch in Vermont. We saw an orange sideways arch in the sky.  We first thought it was the moon but it was a weird orange color and abnormal looking.  The left side was a round darkened area and the right was glowing orange.  The lights throbbed, and then dipped down on the horizon to the left.  They then moved upwards again and got brighter before dipping back down again below the horizon.  We had no further sightings.;44.5355;-73.1937078947369
