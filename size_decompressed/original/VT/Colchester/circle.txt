It was about 1:04 in the morning.;2009-10-27 01:04:00;5 minutes;It was about 1:04 in the morning. I was getting home from the late shift, and near the northern sky, I thought I saw a plane with very bright lights. But as I looked closer at the object, I saw a somewhat circular shape of lights going in a circular motion, with a red, orange, and white pattern change. It was at about 3,000 ft in the sky, and by the time I had got home, I looked into the same direction into the sky, and it had disappeared. It was a weird sighting.
