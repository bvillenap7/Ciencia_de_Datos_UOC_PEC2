One was stationary at the 12 o’clock position while the other was at the 9 o’clock position but moving north.  The stationary object started to climb continuing in the 12 o’clock position.  A tear dropped object, a bright golden white, with a tail seemingly much closer to me came flying by heading in the same direction of the 9 o’clock object, super fast and seemingly much closer to me.;44.5355;-73.1937078947369
