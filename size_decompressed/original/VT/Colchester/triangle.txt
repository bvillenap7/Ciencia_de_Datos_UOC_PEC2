I told my friend to turn around because he was driving, and we went back to where we saw it and it was gone. We searched the sky for about 5 minutes and we didnt see it. I don't know if this is connected, but i live near where we saw it and i keep hearing what sounds like gun shots in the woods behind my house, this is unusal since it is 1130 at night right now. ((ADDENDUM FROM VISITOR TO THE UFOCenter.com website.  PD)) gunshots are not uncommon hearing gunshots in the vermont woods at night isn't unusual. it probably was someone jacking deer.;44.5355;-73.1937078947369
