Bright red moving light in the NE sky;2012-08-16 20:45:00;2:00 minutes;Bright red moving light in the NE sky At about 2045 local time several of us spotted an extraordinarily bright red/orange light in the Northeastern sky.  Moving slowly in a southerly direction, then slightly westerly.  It then seemed to slowly fade away.  In total, the travel probably covered 30 degrees of arc in the sky.  The quality of the light was fluctuating like a flame and it seemed really far away - up very high in altitude.  The whole thing lasted about 2 minutes.;44.5355;-73.1937078947369
