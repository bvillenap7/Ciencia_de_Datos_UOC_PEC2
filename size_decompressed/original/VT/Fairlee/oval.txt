Three pairs of two bright orange discs low in the sky that would change luminosity, and were all connected to each other by a tail.;2016-03-04 18:15:00;5 minutes;Three pairs of two bright orange discs, low in the sky that would change luminosity, and were all connected to each other by a tail. There was a bright orange light in an oval shape, low in the sky at dusk that flamed and got brighter.  It almost looked like a comet, but was not streaking.  It was stationary.  Eventually, this light started to fade out and when it did, it streaked across the sky with a tail, and then another orange oval appeared at the end of it.  The original orange oval reappeared and there was two orange ovals connected by a tail.  It looked like two wheels and an axis.  Then this larger shape faded away.   About two minutes later, I saw the same thing a couple of miles down the road, except this time, when the initial orange colored oval appeared, and burned brightly and then faded into the tail action, two other orange oval shapes popped up in the sky as well simultaneously in different locations.  They both streaked across the sky and followed the same pattern as the initial shape.  So, there were three large shapes in the sky, each one had a an oval shape with a tail connected it to another oval shape.  Three sets of wheels (six wheels) with three sets of axises scattered low in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
