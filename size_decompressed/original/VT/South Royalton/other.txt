I have  original photographs if they need to be documented. Listen, it could have been dust on my lens. But in two of the photos, there is not dust specs all over. But there is a big spec in each of the shots. I do not necessarily believe in UFO's, but I'm open to the possibilities. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested a copy of the photo.  PD));43.8089;-72.5232
