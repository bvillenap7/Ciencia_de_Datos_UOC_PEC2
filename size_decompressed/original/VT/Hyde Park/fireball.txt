Glowing green ball skirting along grounds of house;1997-09-23 20:00:00;15 seconds;Glowing green ball skirting along grounds of house As I was on the back of my father's 3 wheel 'track' vehicle in Hyde Park Vermont I looked over my shoulder and saw a glowing green ball skirting erractically over the ground.  It was approx. 15-20 feet away, several feet from the side of my father's home. After watching it zipping around for several seconds, the glowing green ball 'leapt' over a pinetree - approx. 20 feet high. I was able to see that it was descending once clearing the top of the pinetee. I use the term 'leapt' because that is what it appeared it do -  quite quickly & deliberately as if it did not want to be seen. The ball was florescent green (like a traffic signal at night), perfectly round, about the size of a cantalope, without a 'tail.' It did not leave a trail or make any noise.;44.6205;-72.5963
