I saw very bright white lights that looked like three lights very close together. They were brighter than a star or any other light I had seen in the sky.These lights were staying in one spot and did not move as I was driving towards them. It was as high in the sky as a plane would be and after about 30 seconds of watching them it suddenly disappeared.;44.6205;-72.5963
