Green flying lights over wooded area in Milton.;2015-05-01 21:30:00;2 seconds;Green flying lights over wooded area in Milton. Myself and three friends were having a small fire in my backyard. I looked up into the sky and saw four green, glowing lights moving south to north.  The four lights were moving very slowly when I first saw them, as I pointed them out to a friend they increased speed and vanished from sight.  The lights seemed to be part of the same craft.  Soon after seeing the light multiple owls (2 or 3) started hooting and screeching.;44.6483;-73.1317
