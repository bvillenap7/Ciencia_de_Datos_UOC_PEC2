Two bright white flashes seen in the S/SE at around 35-40 degrees above horizon from Milton, VT.;2005-03-27 20:26:00;1.5 seconds;Two bright white flashes seen in the S/SE at around 35-40 degrees above horizon from Milton, VT. From the south/southeast came two bright white flashes within the span of a second and a half.  Not like an explosion with residual flame/fire/debris, but more like the loud boom fireworks they display on July 4th.  However, there was no percussion heard for the five minutes I waited afterward.   Estimated elevation from Milton, VT, was around 35-40 degrees from horizon and distance is unknown so it could have been towards southern NH or Eastern MA. There was also a large jet flying in that direction not 30 seconds afterwards and flew almost directly over my location.  The only reason I know it was large was due to the marker strobes displayed.   I don't normally like to report these things because of the nature of general thought on UFO's but these were definite and unmistakable white flashes in an area relatively void of these sorts of things.;44.6483;-73.1317
An irrational noise in the middle of the night.;2011-07-07 05:30:00;1 Minute;An irrational noise in the middle of the night. My wife woke up at 0528 hrs., as she usually does right as the sun is rising.  I felt like I was wide awake and couldn't fall back asleep, so I watched her return to sleep.   A few short minutes later, I started hearing a noise I have never heard before.  A noise, which I would expect from a SCI-FI movie.  It was an interesting whopping sound, which I could not correlate with any man made noise.   I told everyone I knew about the sounds I heard and the feelings it gave me.  I am a former special operations Marine with plenty of experience and had no still can not place a finger on the noises I heard.   I just want my story to be told.   I don't feel like I was abducted, but I wouldn't count out the possibility.;44.6483;-73.1317
