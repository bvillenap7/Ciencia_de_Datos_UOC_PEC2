Small silver object landed, and took of leaving goo on the grass.;2012-02-15 13:00:00;60 seconds;a small silver object laned, and took of leaving goo o the grass. 	I was only 13 when this happened. That day I was home from school that day I had a fever and was puking badly. It was noon to one-ish, and I was a sleep on the couch in the living room and the tv was on. There was a loud bang, that came from the window in the kitchen almost like a shot gun blast outside the wall. 	I got up to see what it was. As I went to the window I could see something out the window, so I went to the self and got my motherâ€™s camera because mine was upstairs in my room. I went to the window and took three photos of a craft that looked like a spudnik with 3 legs, and a strip on the center but the bush was blocking the way so I went out onto the deck of the house. 	And I had saw that the craft, it was hovering up about a foot off of the ground. A took another picture, then the craft moved straight up into the air, making no sounds what so ever, as I tried to take another photograph the ship had gone up past the clouds. 	As I walked down to the spot the ship had landed. I saw that the grass was burnt in the spots the legs of the craft were at, there was also pressed down grass in the center with a white goo on the grass, I took some photos of the circle, I went to go touch the goo and when I did my hand became cold, and num. so I went back into the house then. 	One day later, at the same time I had saw the craft, turkey valtures circled the mark, there was about 20 of them. They were there for about 60 seconds and then the were gone, in seconds and I can not tell you were they went. They just left.  email me if you would like to see the photo graphs- i don't trust people seeing them after a flash drive holding the data was stolen from my house, when better flash drives weren't ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
