Two circular orange fireballs over northeastern Vermont;2011-07-31 22:30:00;approximately 3 and 1/2 m;Two circular orange fireballs over northeastern Vermont At approximately 10:30 pm on July 31st 2011, I walked out of my front door to the sight of two orange glowing circular lights in the west (southwestern) sky.  I would describe the size of each light as being similar to a softball. (The size was slightly smaller than the midway point between a star and the full moon)  These balls of light appeared at a diagonal angle from top left to bottom right.   The distance between the two lights started as similar to the two stars that make up the bottom of the ladle Ursa Major.  Neither was stationary at any point.  The movement of each began as top to bottom (becoming closer to each other) and shortly after from left to right becoming closer still.  When the two lights were as close together as slightly less than the diameter of the moon, they appeared to move directly away from my viewing point(the bottom right retreating and fading slightly sooner than the other) The two circular orange lights disappeared at almost the same time.   This sighting took place in about 2 and 1/2 minutes.  The movement of the two lights towards each other took about 1 and 1/2 minutes and the retreat took about 30 seconds. I heard no sound that I could attribute to these lights.  I have never seen anything even slightly similar to these lights.  I have no explanation as to what these lights might be.

2 Orange fireballs floating quickly down rte 5;2012-10-16 21:00:00;1 minute;2 Orange fireballs floating quickly down rte 5 Two orange glowing star like objects observed by a passenger and I in the sky while traveling rte 5 headed to Burke VT.  Upon coming closer they appeared to hover for a moment and looked more like balls of fire.  It was cold,dark and wet outside. The two objects looked like they were fireballs, and were traveling North.  Looked to be floating, but moving quickly.  I thought maybe they could possibly be two hot air balloons, but it was 9pm and 30 degrees and rainy!!  Maybe paper lanterns????;44.5483;-72.0717
