Each seeming to have it's own motion and light. One would appear.  Then disappear.  No visible craft.  No audible sound.  Another, would appear, in a direction opposite from the motion of the prior light.  Each light only visible for approximately 5-10 seconds.  Elapsed time 2 minutes. Not fireworks.  Not an aircraft.  Not a flare. Witnessed by two college educated individuals who are indifferent to the idea of UFOs.  But, in the name of interest, google searched after the incident to see if anyone else saw them, and found that similar reports had happened in the area. Interesting.;44.5483;-72.0717
