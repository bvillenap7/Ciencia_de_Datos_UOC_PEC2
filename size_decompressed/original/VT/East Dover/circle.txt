I looked out the window to see what the weather was doing. I saw a light in the sky. Thinking it was a plane with it's head lights on, but I didn't see any blue or reds on the tips. Also at this point I relized it wasn't going foward or away.It wasn't a helicoptor. It was dead silence outside. Now I was curious, so I kept staring for roughly five minutes. I watched it go from one side to the other in the sky. Then it went up and down. When this bright orb would go from one side to another it would disapear for a sec then reapear to a different part of the sky. Don't know why I waited so long to say something to some one. Also the following week I saw military chopers in the sky. One cargo looking one and a tiny one. That following week I saw something in the day time - a black sphere speeding through sky. I have never see anything move that fast befoere. This isn't the first time I've seen things here in Vermont. I guess cause of the view I hav. It's over 100 miles and crystal clear skies. That helps for stuff like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
