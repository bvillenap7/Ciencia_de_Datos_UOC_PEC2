PD)) I'm a coast to coast insider and heard Peter's report this morning from last night's show. The sighting was from Jericho Vermont. Last night (08.08.2013 9:00 pm â€“ 9:11PM) I went out to watch the International Space Station for the 3rd  time this week. The sky had scattered clouds but was clear in the path of the Space Station. As Station was about half way through the sky when I noticed a small dim object following the Station. It was traveling at the same rate  of  speed slightly behind it off the station's port side. It was a dim redish brown color. I continued watching both till they disappeared over the horizon.  Here is the info from my NASA e-mail on the ISS position at the time of the sighting. Thu Aug 08 9:02 PM, Visible: 6 min, Max Height: 68 degrees, Appears: WSW, Disappears: NE;44.459;-72.9552
