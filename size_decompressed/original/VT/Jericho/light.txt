Two fiery orbs traveling one after the other across the sky, second larger than first, both totally silent then disappearing mid flight;2013-08-09 23:15:00;4 minutes;Two fiery orbs traveling one after the other across the sky, second larger than first, both totally silent then disappearing mid flight I saw a glowing ball moving along the sky in what appeared to be a southwest to northwest trajectory. It was about 45 degrees above the horizon (ie not low on the horizon, and not directly overhead).  It was moving along at the speed you'd expect from a plane, but it was bright red like fire with no flashing lights or discernible shape. I grabbed my wife (more of the skeptic type) and at first she was like, it's a plane.  But then she was like what is THAT!  Behind the first object was a second, same intense fiery color, following a similar path/speed/height but this one was larger.  After watching this travel across the sky for about a minute it slowly faded out and disappeared.  It was a clear night, you could see stars.  There were no other lights or flashing lights on either object, and both were completely silent.  We have a lot of fighter jet activity out here out of the Burlington airport for the National Guard, so we're used to that type of noise and activity.;44.459;-72.9552
