Floating fire changes to 3 triangular lights and speeds away;2013-08-12 11:15:00;2 minutes;Floating fire changes to 3 triangular lights and speeds away This occurs often, appearing many Monday and Thursday nights at 9 pm, if not more often.   What looks like a floating cylinder of fire appears over the field behind the Fields restaurant when I get done my shift at work.   Upon watching this fire-like object for a time it will hover, dim and brighten, and finally the object will dim completely to reveal three blinking lights in a triangular formation.   Once the triangular lights appear the object will speed away.;44.459;-72.9552
