Orange fireball over woodstock vermont following route 4 then turning on to route 12;2012-01-19 19:30:00;5 minutes;orange fireball over woodstock vermont following route 4 then turning on to route 12 Was driving eastbound on route four throught the village of woodstock.  I saw a light in the sky that was to high to be atop of any village structures...as I got down town I realized it was a fire like light. I pulled over and shut off my car. the object made no discernable noise and I though it might have been a hot air balloon... but in a snow storm in January????   It also moved against the wind slowly then turned at about 90 degrees... but seemed to follow route twelve out of the village and eventually out of vision...  I've never seen the like...  it appeared to be a fire orange in colour uniform in shape not wavering in the wind like a candles flame. It stayed the same size relative to distance from me. meaning it neither grew bigger or smaller or changed shape..  was silent too...;43.6178;-72.5354
