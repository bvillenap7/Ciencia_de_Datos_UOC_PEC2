((anonymous report));2018-06-21 00:00:00;10 hours;To the southern side of the sky at midnight me and 4 of my friends and my parents saw this light that we thought was a dying star but then it moved in and out and disappeared when two airplanes came near it.  It is still going on and is terrifying us because it's making noise now. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact  information.  PD));43.6178;-72.5354
