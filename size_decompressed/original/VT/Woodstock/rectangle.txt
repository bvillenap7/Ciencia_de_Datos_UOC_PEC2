Enormous, long, low flying ship flying Westbound over Woodstock, Vermont.;2020-08-05 21:20:00;1 minute;Enormous, long, low flying ship flying Westbound over Woodstock, Vermont My son and I were in our backyard last night on Wednesday, August 5, 2020 at 9:20pm stargazing. I saw what looked like a giant military, C5 transport plane coming directly overhead, from East to West.  The plane was lit up, so we could see it easily, but we also noticed that there was more to it, behind the plane. I had my binoculars and I could see it was very long.  Well behind the plane there was another plane partially lit up.  It was about the same size as the monster transport plane in the front.  As it went overhead, and started to pass toward the west, we could see that they were connected by a large, long middle, as if it were one, large long ship like in the beginning of Star Wars movie.  It was actually quite quiet considering how close it was, and how large it was, but it did sound like a plane, but far, far away.  The object, or ship just continued westward.  It didn't do anything crazy or anything, so I suspect it was a man-made object, but I've neve! r seen anything like it.;43.6178;-72.5354
