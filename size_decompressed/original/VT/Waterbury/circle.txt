Red/orange ball moving then disappeared.;2012-12-24 19:00:00;5 minutes;Red/orange ball moving then disappeared. Upon exiting my place of employment I noticed what looked like a round orange/reddish colored object in the northwestern sky that was moving slowly in a straight line.  The object then stopped and began to move as if to make a half circle then stopped again.   After staying motionless for about a minute the object began to fade until it completely disappeared. No noise came from the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.3431125;-72.775975
