I noticed two bright glowing objects parallel to each other in the sky that appeared to stay stationary throughout the night, however they had disappeared by early morning and were not present the following night. At first I thought they may have been stars, but they were abnormally bright and large.  Fog wasn't present.  It was rather dry. Another person in my household (my father) has told me about these two bright objects he saw the same night, so I can confirm there was something there out of the norm.;44.3431125;-72.775975
