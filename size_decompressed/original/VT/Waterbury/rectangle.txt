Counted 6-7 airplanes in the vicinity at the time. My husband and I saw a craft with large lights on it.  It was at night, but we could tell that it was more rectangular or blimp-like in shape.  It almost hovered and moved slowly across the sky.  At the time we spotted about 6-7 airplanes in the vicinity.  Observing the airplanes, we could tell that this craft definitely was not moving like a plane, was much larger (even for a low-flying plane), and the lights were non-blinking.
