Bright stationary light.;2013-10-05 07:30:00;15-20 minutes;Bright stationary light. We drove from Stowe to Burlington, so I'm not sure exactly where we were, but we saw a bright light above a cloud, too bright to be a star and too stationary to be an airplane.   It hovered for at least 15-20 minutes.;44.6925;-73.0271
