Five red flashing lights in the sky in a configuration over NW Vermont.;2021-04-10 21:00:00;minutes;Five red flashing lights in the sky in a configuration over NW Vermont. On this evening I was going to close the front door when I noticed red flashing lights in the sky directly off to the northwest.  At one point there were five and they were all spaced out, then two dropped out of sight and three remained.  They would blink red, then disappear.  I have a video of this.  My husband also witnessed the event.;44.6925;-73.0271
