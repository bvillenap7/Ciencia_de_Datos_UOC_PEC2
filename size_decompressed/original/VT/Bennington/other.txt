Huge ship with lights everywhere.;2000-06-30 20:00:00;5 minutes;Huge ship with lights everywhere. What I saw was nothing like what you hear.  It was huge, almost octagon shaped.  I saw the bottom of it.  It had lights all over it, including a red light in the middle going in a circle.    was the only noise comming from the ship.  It was so low i could of thrown a rock at it.   It flew over my head and dissapeared.;42.8848;-73.191
bright shooting light, slowly fades away.;2007-08-03 00:00:00;10 seconds;bright shooting light, slowly fades away. My boyfriend and I were outside sitting when we started staring at the sky. We were looking at the sky and just talking. We both looked up and we saw a bright orange/tan light, and at first we thought it was a plane. All of a sudden, the light zoomed ahead, and slowly dimmed. We looked for it with binoculars, but could not find anything. A short while after, it came back, getting closer to us, but not as bright. It then moved again and just slowly dimmed. We couldn't really determine a shape of this one object.;42.8848;-73.191
