saw triangle over head lights on points, whirring sound;1983-01-21 18:00:00;10 minutes;saw triangle over head lights on points, whirring sound My UFO sighting occurred in January of 1983 or 1984.  There was snow on the ground.  I believe it was between 6: 00 or 7:00PM.  The location was Taylor Drive in Springfield, Verrmont. I had eaten dinner with my parents and as I walked through the garage and onto the driveway I stopped in my tracks.  Over my head was a large object, triangular in shape, with colored lights on the points of the triangle.  I wanted to run back into the house to get my parents but I couldn’t move.  I was totally engrossed, enthralled, in awe  I don’t have the all-encompassing adjective to describe what I was seeing.  The object seemed to be stationary and was making a low whirling noise, not loud just constant. I don’t know how long I stood there but I believe it was a little less than a minute.  The object started to go straight up and began moving in a circular motion with the lights blurred.  At this point I was able to move and I ran into the house to get my parents.  They saw the object flying away.  We watched as it flew in a northerly direction.  As it flew, the snow turned orange beneath it. After we had somewhat calmed down I left to go home.  As I pulled onto the street, a very big fireball went past me and kept going in the direction of the original object.  It also caused the snow to turn orange beneath it. We called the local police and they referred me to a place in Denver.  I left a message but no one got back to me.;43.2994;-72.4781
Two unidentified crafts following each other slowly.;2011-01-11 19:45:00;5 minutes;Two unidentified crafts following each other slowly. I was working second shift in a work assignment that had me in a small pickup truck, driving the perimeter of the facility I work at.  I noticed a small craft slowly flying overhead. I stopped my truck, and stepped out to get a better look.  It was then that I noticed there were two crafts.  The first was smaller having only two red lights on it, that were on each side, it was hard to tell because it was dark, but it looked triangular/oval shaped.  The craft following it was moving at the same speed.  Neither of the crafts were making any sound that was audible to me.  The second of the two was much longer, and shaped almost like a wide cigar shape.  It had six to eight lights on it which were appeared to be all along the bottom in pairs of two.  The crafts slowly moved along the sky, keeping the same distance apart the whole time.                        END OF REPORT;43.2994;-72.4781
