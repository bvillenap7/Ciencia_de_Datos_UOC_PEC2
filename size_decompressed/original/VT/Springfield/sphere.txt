Flying orb seen in night sky;2012-11-16 23:00:00;30 minutes;Flying orb seen in night sky At about 11 pm at night, I went outside to see a meteor shower that was supposed to be happening (Leonid Meteor Shower). I sat on my porch, looking at the stars, when I noticed a blinking star. I looked closely and it was blinking red and blue, very bright in color. Then I noticed that it was moving all over the sky, right, left, up, down. I ran inside to get a blanket, and ran back out and it was still there. It would get closer at times, and it would occasionally stop and hover. I could see that it could be a spear shape, with the light in the center and coming from the center there were long lines, as if connecting on the outer rim. I wasn't sure what I was seeing, and kept watching it for an hour, going around the sky, getting closer then further away. When I did get to see it, it looked like some sort of craft, honestly. I don't know how to describe it. It was dark and I could only see so much. I did see a plane fly by and pass by it. I waited for somet! hing to happen, but it continued for an hour before I decided I was freezing and had to go inside. All I know is that I have never seen anything like it before.;43.2994;-72.4781
