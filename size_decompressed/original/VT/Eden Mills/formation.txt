Both witnesses ran outside and saw an object that looked something like a mobile with loosly attached parts, perhaps four or five black rectangles and several shiny objects held together by a fragile frame. The object proceeded Northerly at a relatively constant speed of perhaps 40 miles per hour. We were able to watch it until it became too far to see.All the time It was below white clouds.
