Cylinder, lights were square with some round lights. colors of lights transitioned not in a pattern.;2017-11-19 20:00:00;3 minutes;cylinder, lights were square with some round lights. colors of lights transitioned not in a pattern. On Sunday November 19th, 2017, my kids and I were heading home back to NY on route 4 when we noticed a large object hovering just south of us on RTE 4 heading west.  We just drove though the city of Rutland and we were in the South Western part of the city.  It was cylinder shape.  Almost like a yo yo.  It had two stacks of lights.  Some were square and some were spherical.  The lights changed colors mostly, almost like a color wheel.  There was some overcast so the colors would dissipate in the clouds.  My daughter had made and I had seen an object like that when I was 10 or 11.  Now I am 50.;43.6171;-72.9636
