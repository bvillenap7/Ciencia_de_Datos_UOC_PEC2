Red and green lights hovering and disappearing;2018-05-16 20:35:00;2 minutes;Red and green lights hovering and disappearing My youngest and I were reading in my bedroom, and she said “look, green lights!”  We all looked out and saw green lights moving so softly at first, hover then turn red.  Disappear for a moment, then zoom a little, hover, changed colors four times.  Seemed to be in a small area for 2 minutes.  There was no sound, but it looked fairly close.  When it disappeared, it was so fast that I knew it was not a helicopter,  It was amazing.  My son was ecstatic to have seen something like this.  I’m 35, active in my community, weary of UFO sightings, but certainly not a skeptic.;43.6171;-72.9636
