It caught my eye because it was unusual in sight but also because of location in the sky. Definitely wasn’t an airplane or helicopter & it was moving slow or hovering. I finally pulled over to try & take a picture or video but it’s pace picked up & it was gone.;43.6171;-72.9636
String of Lights In The Sky;2021-05-17 00:00:00;3 Min;String of Lights In The Sky May 17 2021 It was around 12:05AM when I saw a string of small,moving lights in the sky. It seemed as if they were following each other at a slow,steady speed,with no sound. They moved straight at first,and then began to rather act like a snake or centipede. The lights stayed together about 3 minutes and faded out of my view. We could not get a good photo of the object on the cell phone. This has happened once before around the same time of year. The last time I saw them was in July, there were around five bright lights, and more defined. I would like to know what these are, they seem strange to me.;43.6171;-72.9636
