Bright orb witnessed moving back and forth then vanishing, by 3 people in Vermont 1/10/15 16:40;2015-01-10 16:40:00;30 seconds;Bright orb witnessed moving back and forth then vanishing, by 3 people in Vermont 1/10/15 16:40 1/10/15 at 16:40 facing due west, myself and 2 others witnessed a highly luminous orb moving back and forth quickly in the clear almost dusk sky.  My friends saw it first, then texted me in my vehicle.  Text was orb to the left.  Easy to visually acquire because it was the only thing in the sky.  Very bright, almost pure white light.  It was 45degrees in sky from our POV. Witnessed for 25-30 seconds, then completely vanished.  Hard to tell altitude and distance because object size unknown.  Pretty obvious what it was.;43.6171;-72.9636
