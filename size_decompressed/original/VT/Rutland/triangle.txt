The light the triangle shape no sound, even a hotair bollon make noise;1985-09-05 02:15:00;80 sec;The light the triangle shape no sound, even a hotair bollon make noise I wood say the craft huvered 150FT off the ground, about 3 telephone poles hight.I was about 400FT from it!!! I wood say the craft was not longer than 30 FT, maybe only 25FT. color was dark like blueing on a gun. The light under the back was as wide as the hull's width, the light went around (or rapped up) the back of the hull (or transom),The light was as brite as (or glowed as) 100 colamen gas lantern. Not a sound as it fluw off slow, No wings No roters No bollons NO SOUND (NO SOUND) Yes it did have a aura or haze around it, almost an alumnation. It was flat on it's top and flat on it's bottom. But (one thing) the cockpit (glass) was much like a fighter jet from the late 50s. I know what I saw was real, But who made it? My background, I'm a nobody, just a guy liveing in Vt, a home lathe machinists. And I do beleave!!!!;43.6171;-72.9636
Triangle with three lights sighted in Vermont;2010-04-12 21:40:00;3 seconds;Triangle with three lights sighted in Vermont The sky was cloudless and starry.  I looked up from my driveway to see what I first thought was a night bird, but as my eyes followed it, I could see it was a horizontal triangle with three lights.  Because the night sky was filled with stars, I could see the shape of the object as it blocked the starsâ€™ light.  The triangle appeared to be about 200 feet up, moving easterly in an almost-straight line, wobbling slightly, not always quite level.  It moved at the pace of a soaring bird, coasting through the air.  It seemed to be about five feet wide.  Three round lights were evenly spaced in its corners, the same color as the stars, pale bluish-white, with indistinct edges.  The triangle itself appeared to be grayish, though that may be only because it was against the dark sky.  I noticed in particular that it made no sound.;43.6171;-72.9636
