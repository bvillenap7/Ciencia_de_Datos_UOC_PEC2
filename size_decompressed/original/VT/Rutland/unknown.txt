2 red lights and 1 white in a triangular pattern on an airborne craft that was neither plane nor helicopter;2007-03-13 00:00:00;4-5 minutes;2 red lights and 1 white in a triangular pattern on an airborne craft that was neither plane nor helicopter I noticed a light outside my window around midnight and thought it was a helicopter, because it was lower in the sky and did not follow a direct flight path like a plane. When it got closer, I noticed I couldn't hear it, it wasn't loud like a helicopter, and I couldn't make out it's shape. When it moved closer I saw three lights in a triangular pattern, 2 red and 1 white blinking randomly. I couldn't tell what side of the aircraft I was looking at because it was very dark, but the lights seemed to be in the center of whatever side I saw.
