extremly low in the sky streaking horizontally leaving a long trail behind itself and eventually exploding.;2010-11-02 19:18:00;3 minutes;extremly low in the sky streaking horizontally leaving a long trail behind itself and eventually exploding. Very clear night sky on the cold side with vibrant star viewing I noticed a bright light streaking across the sky.  It was extremely white and crisp in its color, almost star like.  It zoomed horizontally about 25 feet above me and about a half a mile in length.   I pulled over and open the window to see it more clearly and it exploded and seemed to evaporate into the air.  What struck me funny was the extreme intensity of light and the long trail it left as it streaked across the sky only 25 feet above me.   I have never seen such a sight.;43.6171;-72.9636
Light/Fireball heading towards earth, 9 PM, Rutland Vermont, Whitish-Green streak of light behind and no explosion.;2012-03-05 21:30:00;10 seconds;Light/Fireball heading towards earth, 9 PM, Rutland Vermont, Whitish-Green streak of light behind and no explosion. Around 9:30 PM I happened to glance quickly out a large widow that faces southwest, when I suddenly saw a fireball/light streak across the sky.  It looked to be relatively high up, to be honest I thought it was a plane crashing when I first saw it because there's an airport nearby.  There was no noticeable noise being emitted. It was bright white and left a long whitish-green streak of light or vapor behind it which dissipated about 10 minutes later.  I didn't see or hear any explosion, I also could not tell where it landed because of how dark it was outside.  It was definitely not a meteor either, I've seen many meteor showers and this did not look like one at all.;43.6171;-72.9636
