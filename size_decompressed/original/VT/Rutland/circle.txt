I was out side star gazing looking up and a saw a light moving not a plane all the sudden the light got very white bright.   I called my daughter and looked back up and the white bright light had receded to the norm and was gone than i saw a plane coming fast and closing on another light that was heading west turning south. In middle of turn bright lights streached back twards both wings and looked like a triangle but we could still see the plane tail lights. All the sudden, i noticed a plane coming north right towards it than the lights disappeared and the plane tailing it kept going south and the other passed it to the left of the plane still heading north.;43.6171;-72.9636
Circular points of multi-colored flashing lights.;2015-01-09 23:30:00;2.5 hours;Circular points of multi-colored flashing lights. Four of us viewed a circular display of multi-colored flashing lights in what appeared a close orbit above the earth's atmosphere.  The shape of the points of light evolved and rose in the night sky.   Between 22:30 and 1:30 a.m., we studied them in a small Celestron telescope.  They remained together but the shape shifted slightly as time elapsed.   Curious if others have seen this phenomena?;43.6171;-72.9636

Round dark silhouette with bright orange light moving different directions;2021-06-20 21:52:00;5 minutes;Round dark silhouette with bright orange light moving different directions I was driving up West Street, in Rutland, VT, around 9:45pm, and a bright orange light shot across the sky, right in front of me. It wasn't very high up, lower then where a plane would be but MUCH higher then where a kite would fly. Instantly, I pulled over because I could see the bright orange-ish light (a round silouette shape) hovering right in the sky. I pulled over and was just so blown away by what I was seeing. The UFO quickly would shoot up, hover slowly, then go down, hover slowly, then shoot diagonally. The light would hover down at first, making a kind of blur because it moved so fast.  Then slowly hover back up.. I realized I need to video this! So I pulled my phone out and took a video of it.  The round orange flying object would slowly hover up, then over.  at this point it was moving alot slower. This had gone on for about 5 minutes since I had pulled over. And then all of a sudden, it just took off and flew away.;43.6171;-72.9636
