I was sitting in my living room with my husband, who is a chef.  We were drinking wine and talking when I suddenly got an urge to look out side.  I looked into southern sky and low and behold there was something there.  It was like a mass of lights all bunched together.  I couldn't tell the shape of the craft, and the lights were all different colors and blinking.  I looked, couldn't figure out what it was, and sat back down.  Then I got up a couple minutes later and looked again and it was still just sitting there.  I didn't tell any one except my dad, my husband hates talking about that stuff.  I would say that it was above the tree line a lot, but I can't tell how high that is.;44.3944;-72.5609
