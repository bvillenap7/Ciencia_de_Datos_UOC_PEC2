I work for a radio station in northern Vermont and what I saw I will describe--it not that big a deal really.  There is a comet forgotten the name to lazy to look it up but a comet or fuzz ball like or bigger than the 7 sisters that I saw in the eastern sky. This fuzz ball was moving over so slowly but in odd directions to the rotation of the earth not making any sense.  A friend of mine alerted me to it and said hey go outside and check out the comet. I did and went out several times only to find that it had moved to odd positions and in weird trajectories that a comet would not normally follow.  My only conclusion is that it was man made perhaps a urinal dump that caught the sunlight similar to when you can the ISS or other satellites at night but then why would it move into the different positions over the course of the next hour and half.  It is the erratic nature of the movement. The sighting  took place this evening in mostly clear skies with good clarity on a cold winter night with temperatures in the 20s.
