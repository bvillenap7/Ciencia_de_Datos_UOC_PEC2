A rel;2000-07-20 01:30:00;six minutes;See the Barre-Montpelier Times Argus daily newspaper of 7/21/00 Talk of the Town column.  Several people called in the report.  A reliable friend of mine, 18 years old, going home at 1:30 in the morning saw this bright light goin up and down in the field off Rt. 2 near the Marshplain Inn.  It was over Charlie Bickford's field.  She was driving and says she never saw anything like it.  Then suddenly if completely surrounded her car.  She was crying and shaking and thought she was going to die.  When she got home, she couldn't find her housekey, and rang the bell incessantly for her mom to get up and open the door.  I spoke to her mom, who informed me that her daughter was shaking and crying.  (Her mom has to work at 7 in the morning, and this kid would never wake up her mom for no reason!  Then I saw the report in the Times Argus today.  It is an exact description of what the girl reported, only by a tourist from Arizona, who pulled off the road to watch it.
