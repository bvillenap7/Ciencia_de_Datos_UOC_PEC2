Very bright light in sky that turned orange before dimming out;2008-04-07 16:00:00;7 minutes;Very bright light in sky that turned orange before dimming out We saw a bright, white light hovering over a mountain in the east from a view at our house.  The light was so bright that it caught our attention from inside our house (we have windows that look out towards the view).  Airplanes normally travel north/south in our area.  The light was white then dimmed and rebrightened to orange.  It was like a huge spotlight in the sky shining straight horizontally towards us.  My husband said he could see it was going down vertically very slowly.  When it became orange, it shined for a minute or so and then dimmed out until it was completely gone.  It did not reappear.;44.2034;-73.2423

The last occurance was still further down the road it was a transparent green orb about 6 feet off the ground against a snow bank.;44.2034;-73.2423
Light in the sky.;2016-11-19 16:00:00;30 seconds;Light in the sky Thought it was a plane flying in the day time.  The sun looked like it was reflecting off the  plane.  It was really bright, I got out of the car to see closer.  The light stopped flashing or reflecting of the plane.  The plane then disappeared and I didn't see it again.   Lasted 30-45 secs.  Could have been there longer but I'm not sure.;44.2034;-73.2423
