Witnessed by one man taking a walk at 330 am I came out to take a walk at 330 am with my dog and was looking at the stars when I noticed a white light moving SWtoSE and was way to low to be a jet and also there was absolutely no sound.   This object seemed to just glide across the sky and then was simply gone.  This whole event took approximately 5 minutes.;44.5542;-72.6002
