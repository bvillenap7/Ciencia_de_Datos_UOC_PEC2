It was moving slowly from west to east then stopped and pulsated with a red, orange, and yellow glow.  After stopping for approximately two minutes, the orb started moving from south to north slowly and the light went out.  As the orb moved slowly across the evening sky, I could see it moving slowly out of site silouetted against the evening sunset.   There was no wind and the object made no sound.  It was not an aircraft;44.5542;-72.6002
