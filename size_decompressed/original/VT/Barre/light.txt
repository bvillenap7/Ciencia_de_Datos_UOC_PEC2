Bright orange lights fading in and out in a perfect diagonal pattern over Barre;2009-11-17 19:30:00;1 Minute;Bright orange lights fading in and out in a perfect diagonal pattern over Barre Driving on the south end of Allen st we saw a two bright orange lights toward the north east that didnt look like it was much more than 100 feet high.  The two lights where in a diagonal pattern.  The Bottom light would fade out and a new light would appear in a perfect diagonal pattern at the top.  The the original top bright orange light would become the bottom and it too would fade out and a new one would appear in line above the one light left.  It gave the appearance that the lights where walking but never actually going anywhere.;44.1968;-72.4976
3 reflecting objects seen in day sky in formation.;2013-05-03 08:30:00;2 minutes;3 reflecting objects seen in day sky in formation 3 lights in close proximity where witnessed on route to work at 8:30am.  The lights resembled stars you might see in the night sky.  The formation was that of an upside down L.  The sky at 8:30 was very bright with the sun shining reflecting off the three objects.  The objects where semi-stationary.  When observed using a building top as reference it could be seen that they all did sway slightly left-to-right and up-to-down.  The only explanation I can come up with is 3 super large silver balloons strung together.  The 3 objects where not hard to see, as would be ballons high up in the sky.  The objects clearly reflected sunlight and after a minute disappeared.  The sky was cloudless.;44.1968;-72.4976
