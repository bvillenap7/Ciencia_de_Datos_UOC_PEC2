This 58 year old observer is prior military Seaman/U.S.Coast Guard/ ANT (Navigation Technician) technician trained to search for lights with many nighttime missions at sea in Maine and Canada.                                         I was walking home at night and made my usual stop to catch my breath at the top of the hill before my home, a cleared area where I look to the east towards Maine and look at the stars on clear nights.  I observed one star far off in the distance that seemed unusually bright and looked closer at it to observe anything different.   When I focused more attention it immediately began to move across the sky and then directly towards me at first a moderately rate, then faster, and then suddenly silently stopped in front of me approximately 100 yards away and 500 feet elevation.  It made no sound.  The sphere shaped object appeared to be approximately 120 ft. in diameter and was clearly honeycombed with dimples like a golf ball, bright white light with goldish fluctuating tint.  It appeared to be observing me as I just remained calm and stared up at it.  This lasted about 5 minutes.   Suddenly what appeared to me as clearly some type of unusual flying craft, took off slowly over my head to the west then increased its speed to warp speed or mach speed and just disappeared off in the distance without a sound.
