1 Orange fireball not moving;2012-05-30 02:04:00;4 minutes;1 Orange fireball not moving My dad and I woke up for a few mins to smoke a cigarette and he said, what is that?! So I looked in the direction he was pointing and seen an orange fireball in the sky.  We could see it at level to the tree lines through the trees in the sky.  It was a round fireball.  It was not moving, just sitting in one place and did not move as far as we know.  It may have been there for a while longer we just noticed it as we woke up.  Then after looking at it for about 4 mins it just went out, nothing.  Like it just blinked out.  We live on a hill and it was facing out through the trees overlooking the town.  Before this happened a few weeks ago, have been seeing other strange things, hearing strange noises, and all different types of strange occurances.;44.1968;-72.4976

There appeared to be fireball type objects moving across the sky in groups from the east. First there appeared 4 in a diamond formation that came overhead and tailed off to the left and faded out.   Then about 8 orange fireballs came overhead and again tailed off to the left and some appeared to fade out and others kept moving out of sight.   Finally a couple more came overhead, appeared to slow down, and then proceeded to the west.   The objects were silent and appeared to glide.
