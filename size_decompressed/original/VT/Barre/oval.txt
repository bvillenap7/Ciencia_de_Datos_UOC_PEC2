Bright light/disk shaped ship  with 5 windows hovering for at least 45 minutes near exit 6 I-89;2013-11-13 17:50:00;40 minutes;Bright light/disk shaped ship  with 5 windows hovering for at least 45 minutes near exit 6 I-89 I came home from work about 1800.  My wife told me she could see a strange bright light in the western sky.  I told her it was probably the satellite that we have always seen in the western sky.  She told me to take a look anyway.   I went out in my yard and this very bright object (about 10x a bright star) was  hovering more south and lower in the southwestern sky.  My wife had said it was slowly steadily dropping in altitude looking up to exit 6 ramp to I-89.   I figured to look at it from my bedroom window with binoculars to see above the trees obscuring my view.  When I looked out my bedroom window, I had a perfect view of this light just over the apartment building across the street.   I estimate the distance to this light 1-2 miles.  Maybe less. maybe more.  Very hard to tell the distance but it was quite bright.  When I looked at this light with my binoculars it looked light a disk/oval ship with 5 windows that I could see.  It was like pulsating!  The aura of bright! light all around it.  I shouted for ((name deleted/wife)) to come confirm this as I really could'nt believe my eyes.  I gave the binoculars to her,looked up and it was gone.  No trace.  Almost like it knew I spotted it.  It was very strange but my wife asures me that this object was airborne and not a land based object on the hill.;44.1968;-72.4976
