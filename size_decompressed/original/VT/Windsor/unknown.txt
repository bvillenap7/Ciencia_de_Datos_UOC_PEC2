GREEN AND RED FLASHING LIGHTS IN WESTERN SKY OVER VERMONT FROM EASTERN VERMONT.;2016-09-06 22:00:00;22:35;GREEN AND RED FLASHING LIGHTS IN WESTERN SKY OVER VERMONT FROM EASTERN VERMONT. MULTIPLE RED AND GREEN LIGHTS, WITH AN OCCASIONAL WHITE LIGHT, WERE FLASHING IN THE WESTERN SKY - IT STAYED IN THE SAME PLACE FOR APPROXIMATELY 35 MIN. AND THEN IT APPEARED THAT A WHITE BEAM OF LIGHT CAME OUT OF IT AND THEN IT STARTED TO MOVE OVER THE HORIZON IN THE WESTERN SKY.  WE TRIED TO USE BINOCULARS TO SEE IT - THE LIGHTS BECAME MORE VISIBLE, BUT STILL COULD NOT DETERMINE THE EXACT SHAPE.  AT FIRST WE THOGUTH THAT IT MIGHT BE A SATELLITE, OR THE SPACE STATION, BUT WE LOOKED THAT UP AND THEY WERE NOT ANYWHERE IN THIS REGION.;43.4723;-72.4088
