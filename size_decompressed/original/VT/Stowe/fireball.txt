Fireball above rt 100 and Moscow rd in pouring rain;2011-08-11 23:15:00;10 minutes;Fireball above rt 100 and Moscow rd in pouring rain It was at 11:15 pm. Raining, thunder and lighting. We were driving home to Stowe on rt 100 at about a half a mile south of Moscow rd we started to see a fireball in the sky, we stopped and watched it, then it started to move north along rt 100. We proceeded to follow it to Moscow rd where it seemed to stop so we parked. We stood there and watched it along with another couple who had also stopped to watch. It zig zagged around the sky until it just disappeared. It made no sound, and appeared to be below the clouds because it was raining so hard. Never seen anything like.
