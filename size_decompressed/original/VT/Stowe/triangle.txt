Triangular green and red flashing lights seem over Mt. Mansfield.;2019-02-20 00:30:00;20 minutes;Triangular green and red flashing lights seem over Mt. Mansfield. Thought at first I was viewing a shooting star, but the trajectory of the ufo was too linear, and it seemed to be moving from high to low elevation, instead of across the sky.  It had a long white/yellow tail and a glowing red head but then once it got to a certain elevation everything went dark and there weâ€™re a series of green and red flashing lights in a triangular pattern that remained and moved slowly away from my viewing point.   The lights hovered over Mt. Mansfield for 20 minutes and I could clearly make out a blinking triangular pattern.  Then the lights vanished, as if a switch had been flipped, and the ufo was gone.
