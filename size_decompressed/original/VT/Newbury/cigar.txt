UFOs caught by accident on cell phone while photographing an iridescent cloud formation.;2015-06-08 13:30:00;15 minutes;UFO&quots caught by accident on cell phone while photographing an iridescent cloud formation As a passenger in my friend's car in the afternoon.  I saw a very cool looking iridescent cloud, so I took multiple pictures with my cell phone as we were driving.   We pulled over and I took more outside of the car.  I did not discover the UFO's in the pictures until I got home and viewed the photo's of the cloud.  There appeared to be  sliver cigar shaped ones that split into a red one and a blue one, they stayed stationary then split into several again.  They also appeared to instantly move to the opposite sides of cloud.   It was pretty exciting. I posted them on you tube and circled them in red, stop the slide show and zoom in to get a close look.   Go to YouTube Newbury, VT, UFO's caught by accident.
