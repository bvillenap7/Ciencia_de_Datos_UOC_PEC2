White Pulsating Light With Red;2013-09-29 19:30:00;10 minutes;White Pulsating Light With Red I was sitting on the front porch when I observed an extremely bright light to the west at the 2 o'clock position.  The area of sky around it was reflecting some of the light.  I grabbed my binoculars, and could see a distinct red light flashing at the top.  No metal was observed, just the brilliant white pulsating light.  It descended slowly and disappeared below the tree line.  I would guess the distance to be about 20 miles away.
