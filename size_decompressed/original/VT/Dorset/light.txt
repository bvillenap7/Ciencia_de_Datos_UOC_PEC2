Husband and wife witness approximately 7 red-orange orbs over route 7.;2013-12-25 19:00:00;5 minutes;Orbs over route 7 My wife and I were driving northbound on US Route 7 between Manchester and Dorset, VT. We rounded a turn to a clearing overlooking a valley and spotted approximately 7 brightly lit red-orange orbs about 700 feet off the ground in a fairly random formation.  No sounds were audible from said objects.  No flashing or other light features they were a solid, even color and brightness. They appeared to be stationary initially, but after we passed the area I checked my mirrors to see if they were still there and they were over the road, so evidently they were moving quite slowly.  We thought maybe they were the beacons atop radio towers at first but realized that towers are generally lit down their masts as well, not just the top.  My wife was watching them out the rear window of the car and eventually they passed over the road and disappeared over a hill.  The whole experience was over in 5 minutes or less. We are familiar with airplanes, hot air balloons and helicopters but the lighting looked nothing like any aircraft we've ever seen, and that's saying something because we live 2 miles from an airbase and major airport.;43.264;-73.0808
