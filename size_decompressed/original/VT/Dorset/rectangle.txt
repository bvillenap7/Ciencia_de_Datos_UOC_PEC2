String of white lights moving slowly in formation.  ((Starlink satellites??));2021-05-27 21:20:00;3 minutes;String of white lights moving slowly in formation Took my dog out and noticed a straight line of white lights in the sky moving toward the southeast. I would estimate at least a dozen lights or more. The light appeared slightly wavy.  I would describe it as if it were a plane pulling a banner of white lights, but I could see no plane, heard no sound, and the lights stayed in formation.  It gradually faded into the southeast over the course of just a few minutes.  It did not appear to be traveling fast and was not very high in the sky. I was a clear night, but I could not make out the outline of any craft.;43.264;-73.0808
