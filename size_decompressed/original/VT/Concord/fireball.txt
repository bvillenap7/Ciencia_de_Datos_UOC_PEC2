On Friday night around 7 pm I saw orange things that were round.  They would quickly light up and there was 3-5 in a row.  Then they were gone for a minute.   Then they came back in a different part of the sky.  Blinking and disappearing, almost like fire but very round and in a line.   Sometimes there was one other times several.   These were not a shooting star.  What were these things?  No noise at all and it lasted about 5 minutes.  It did not look like anything from this world.;44.4461;-71.8676
