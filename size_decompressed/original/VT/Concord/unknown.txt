Golden orb light that becomes three, and then six lights hovering over the trees.;2015-01-08 17:55:00;1-2 minutes;Golden Orb light that becomes three, and then six lights hovering over the trees. I was driving along Route 2, headed west to a basketball game.  Right before I came into the town of Concord, I notice movement in my peripheral vision, to my left.   I quickly slowed down and pulled to the side of the road.  For a split second I thought I was seeing fireworks, because the light was rising over the tree tops.   I next expected to see it burst into a pretty display.  But I quickly realized the orb of golden light I was seeing were no longer in motion.  It appeared that the one golden orb, quickly split into three, spaced a short distance apart.  That quickly became 6 orbs, 3 in each group.  They were in a line completely even with each other, but hovering over the tree tops.  It was dark out, so the lights were very bright, but not extremely large.  Then they disappeared as quickly as they had formed.   I am an outdoor photographer, and have never seen anything like this in my life.  I have driven this road everyday for over 5 years, and sporadically before ! that for over 15 more.  I still can't process what I saw.  I have told a few people and they suggest that maybe it was a drone, seems those have become so popular lately.  But the lights were spaced at least the distance of a midsized car.  I am at a loss, and have no explanation for what I saw, so I figured I would report it to you hoping someone else saw something similar.;44.4461;-71.8676
