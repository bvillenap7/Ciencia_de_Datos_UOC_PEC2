My daughter and I were driving down Rte 5 going North coming from Dummerston Vermont to Putney Vermont.  We were probably about 1/8 of a mile from the Sunoco Gas Station in Putney when we saw a very bright white light in the sky that was standing still.  I said that is too bright to be a star so the farther we got down the road, it became appparent that this thing in the sky was a UFO.  We immediately pulled over to the side to the road (someone else pulled over too) and I looked up and the object was trianglar in shape with a rectangle at the horizontal end of the triangle.  There were 3 white lights in the triangle, one on top of 2 and red and green lights in the rectangle (red and green and red and green).  It was very close to the us and flew right over our heads going South.  Then it went East very quickly and went out of sight.;43.0361;-72.5078
