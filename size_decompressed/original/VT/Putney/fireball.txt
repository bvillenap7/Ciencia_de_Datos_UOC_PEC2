Not blinking, possibly rising, disappears after a minute of observation. Red light near eastern horizon. Not blinking. Brighter than a planet or typical airplane. Seemed to rise slightly over the course of a minute, but I could have imagined it. Got somewhat dimmer about twenty seconds after being noticed, then returned to original brightness, then after another ten seconds faded out over 1-2 seconds. I looked through binoculars, and it was in focus at the maximum focal length, implying to me that it was at least farther than a few hundred feet away.;43.0361;-72.5078
