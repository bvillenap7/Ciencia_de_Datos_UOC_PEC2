Reddish-orange orb that moved noiselessly from east to west, about 1,000 feet up, then suddenly shot straight up until it was no longer;2014-06-28 20:30:00;2-3 minutes;Reddish-orange orb that moved noiselessly from east to west, about 1,000 feet up, then suddenly shot straight up until it was no longer A group of us was sitting outside camping.  One of our group said, “I wonder what that is?”   We looked up and saw a larges reddish-orange orb moving toward us (east to west). It was glowing like it was lit from inside.  The colors appeared to be moving, with even a hint of blue visible – much like a fire.  It did not make any sound whatsoever.  It was about 1,000 feet up and from where we stood it looked about the size of a dinner plate.  It continued to move toward us. It definitely was not a plane, helicopter, weather balloon, hot air balloon, flare, Chinese lantern, or anything else of the sort.  It stopped almost over us (probably about 200 feet from the shore of the lake).  It stayed there for a moment or two and then suddenly shot straight up, very fast.  It kept going up in a straight line until it looked like one of the many stars (it was a clear night).  We kept watching and then it became smaller than one of the stars until we could no longer see it.;44.1298;-73.2756
2 bright reddish-orange fireballs seen flying in a unique flight path not seen by usual aircraft.;2016-07-19 21:15:00;7-10 minutes;2 bright reddish-orange fireballs seen flying in a unique flight path not seen by usual aircraft. I was driving home from work at approximately 21:15 hrs on 7/19/16, when I saw a bright reddish orange fireball.  I thought immediately that it was a burning Chinese lantern.  I saw it quickly for a few seconds, but had to keep my attention to the road and traffic.   I was almost home at that point and quickly parked so I could relocate it in the sky.  I was amazed as I looked over towards town and saw 2 of them in close proximity of each other. One started traveling southerly towards me and the other one travelled east ward, separating from each other.  The one that came towards me was like a fireball, kind of shimmering as if it was on fire. Its speed slowed to almost a stop as it turned 45 degrees and headed due east.   Airplanes in my area come out of the south and travel north or come from the southeast and travel northwest.  I have never seen an airplane or jet fly north to south or fly towards the east.  A very unusual flight path.  From the time I first saw them! until they were gone was about 7-10 mins.;44.1298;-73.2756
