Two supposed spacecrafts with one big light, and 2-3 small lights flying, and shooting up.;2018-08-20 23:32:00;45-50 minutes;Two supposed spacecrafts with one big light, and 2-3 small lights flying, and shooting up. At the Vergennes Job Corps center, my friend (_null_) and my roommate were all talking about UFO sightings and the Rake that they’ve claimed to see.  (_null_)’s roommate, who is in the room right next to mine, comes running in, exclaiming to look out of the window.  We look out the window, and (_null_) returns to his room to see, since there are only two windows in my room. 	I see right above the trees, a light that my three friends have seen before.  A small bright light, that is just close enough for me to see that there are multiple lights one big one up top (thinking it’s the front), and about 2 to 3 in back (lower than the big one.  Depth wasn’t present, but it would make sense). After about five minutes of staring at it, it seems the clouds are covering it slowly.  It dims, then fades away.  Meanwhile, there is a dim plane with green and red lights flying with a trajectory that goes just under the big light(s).  It too disappears into the clouds, but get this: what I thought was the original light, appeared right where the plane vanished, and it started moving the direct opposite direction the plane was moving.  It kept moving at a decent speed.  Not fast, but not super slow either. After that disappears behind the side of the building, we see the original light again. I kept staring at that light for about another thirty minutes, as it faded, and came back a few times, even when the clouds that I could kind of see, weren’t in the way, but that is questionable.  It shot upwards, looking like a shooting star, and was completely inaudible. My thought, is that if it is a non-human spacecraft, it was a remote observer.  Scanning, observing, et cetera until enough information was received, and flew to the next observation point.;44.1298;-73.2756
