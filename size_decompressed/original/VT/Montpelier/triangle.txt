Saw a ufo in montpelier.;2012-11-10 20:25:00;10 minutes;Saw a ufo in Montpelier Walking down court street toward main.   To our right near town there were 3 orange red dots.  The dot closest to us moved upward and then we noticed all 3 dots seemed to go in the same direction.  It banked left and disdapeared over what I could say may be Berlin or barre.   Object was silent and moved slowly.  Like it was observing. It was weird. And then this mist that smelled like woodsmoke was over the town.  Toward Hubbard and Barre streets.   So weird.   Did anyone else report this? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.2654;-72.5764
