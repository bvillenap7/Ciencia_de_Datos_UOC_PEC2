Witnessed a blinking red light.  At first I thought it was a plane.  However the object was accompanied by zero sound.   The light appeared to move on fluid and zig zagging motions.  Often the light would stop and hover before moving.  At times the frequency of blinking became much more rapid.  The light was also accompanied by a white blinking light that appeared to be attached to the red light.   Object lingered for about seven minutes before moving slowly away to the east out of sight.  Weather:  partly to mostly cloudy.  Light wind.  Some visible moonlight from full moon.;44.2654;-72.5764
Red single light object, stationary with quick changing travel patterns to other locations.;2015-07-03 21:50:00;20 minutes;Red single light object, stationary with quick changing travel patterns to other locations. Red light that hovered above Montpelier downtown during firework celebration.  Seen from the top of National Life building.  It hovered in place for 1-2 minutes, then would move to another random spot at a fast speed and hover again.   No pattern or clear direction in movement, almost a zig zag pattern.  But when it traveled it was a direct path.  The only real visible shape was a round red light, same color as an airplane but not blinking and seemed to be very far away.   At first observation, we thought it was a beacon on top of the building until it moved.  After a time of about 20 minutes and prior to the fireworks ending, it simply flew away very fast heading northeast.  There was no sound.;44.2654;-72.5764
