It was moving very slow going from west to east.  As it moved closer overhead it then appeared reddish-orange before disappearing just above a low cloud mass to the west.  I tried taking a video with my iPhone, but it was too cold and I couldn't get it to work.  However, I did snap 2-3 photos and when enlarged appear to show what I describe as a can-shaped object. My 8 yr old daughter witnessed this as well, but only after I called her out of the house.  I would guess the total time I watched it was roughly 4-6 minutes.  It made no sound that we could hear and anything that seemingly low in the sky should be able to be heard.  I can't quite make out the full detail when I crop the photos on my iPhone but can tell it is a shape that does not look anything like a plane or helicopter.  I can send pics but I need an email address.;44.2654;-72.5764
