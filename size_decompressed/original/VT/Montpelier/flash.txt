I tried to play it off as fireworks or maybe a transformer blowing, so I slowed down trying to hear it cuz we had the front windows down.   Maybe 20-30 seconds later another red flash just as bright light the sky again.  Finally, I pulled over so I could put my head out the window and investigate further but that was all that happened.  No noise at all, other cars in front of Mt were reacting as well.;44.2654;-72.5764
