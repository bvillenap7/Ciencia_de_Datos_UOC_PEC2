I Was Driving my grandmother Home.  We Were On The Bridgewater Center Road Headed Toward Route 4 When We Saw A Bright, White, Shimmering Object That Was far Too Large To Have Been A Star.  It Was Silent,   We Pulled Off The Road To Observe The Object, And Put Our Windows DownTo Listen.  It Never Moved,  But After About 2 Or 3 Minutes, all At Once,  It Just Disappeared.  It Did Not Dim, It Just Disappeared. This Sighting Lasted For 3 Minutes.   After Dropping My Grandmother Off, I Returned To The Exact Spot We Had Observed The Object From.  The Object Was Gone But Two Planes Could Be Seen And Heard Flying In The Same Section Of Sky Where We Had Seen This Huge Orb Of Light.;43.599;-72.6711
