My friend and I were running our hunting dogs in Arlington, Vt, off of Kelly Stand Road at 5pm in late August of 1976.  We started out in the woods about a half mile in, we came to a mountainess valley, and let our dogs off the leash to run.  After a few minutes, we happened to look into the sky and saw a large dish shaped object, dark grey in color, against a green mountain background so we could really see it clearly.  It was about three quarters of a mile away and looked very large to us.  As we looked at it in awe,two smaller objects came out of the rear or side of the large object.  This object made no sound or had no lights or windows that we could see.  Whe we witnessed this, we called our dogs in and ran back to our trucks.
