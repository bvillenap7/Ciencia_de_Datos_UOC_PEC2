Bright orange lights moving slowly in formation.;2011-09-03 21:00:00;10 minutes;Bright orange lights moving slowly in formation. While in the front of my home, I spotted several very bright orange lights, originating from the north east, traveling very slowly in a triangle pattern.  It was highly unusual and I went into the house to have my wife verify the sighting.  We then saw approximately 5 additional lights traveling in a similar manner.  There was absolutely no sound, they abruptly changed direction and gained altitude and faded out.  I estimate the lights were about 1000 ft altitude before moving off.  I am an avid plane spotter and these craft were not like any I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.5068;-73.0884
