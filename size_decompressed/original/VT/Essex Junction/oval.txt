Yellow/Green oval seen over Essex Junction, VT.;2013-05-01 21:43:00;15 seconds;Yellow/Green oval seen over Essex Junction, VT I was driving my car but my friend in the passenger seat pointed it out to me.  There was only one, shaped like a large oval it looked like it was arcing down slightly, bright yellow in the very center, but green on the outside. I thought it was a shooting star at first, but it was way too big and, I think, flying too low, at about a 45-degree angle to us. The colors were constant, no blinking or flickering, and there was not a cloud in the sky!;44.5068;-73.0884
