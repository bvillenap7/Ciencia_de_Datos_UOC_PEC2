Fast bright moving light came out of nowhere;2012-02-20 01:45:00;5 seconds;Fast bright moving light came out of nowhere Saw a VERY bright VERY big ball of light. It came out of nowhere.  Didn't see it raise up, it was just there all of the sudden very low in the sky.  Within a second or 2 after it appered it took off EXTREMLY fast in a downward directon.   I have never seen ANY object in the sky move that fast or be that bright.  I've just never seen anything like that in my life.  I stood there in shock for a good 45 seconds before running back inside.   I could not see any type of aircraft body because the light was just so bright.  It just looked like a extremly bright white light in a perfect circle.   When it took off it lost the perfect circle shape.  It kind of looked like a tadpole (except MUCH bigger), round head with a tail coming off of it.;44.4346;-73.0962
Stationary diagonal line of white lights NE of Williston, above horizon.;2013-02-06 17:50:00;5 minutes;Stationary diagonal line of white lights NE of Williston, above horizon. Sighting corroborated with 3 independent witnesses at different locations. A line of 5-7 bright lights in a perfect horizontal line (approx. 45 degree angle) was observed low over the horizon northeast of Williston, VT.  The sky was clear (cloudless) and in the twilight, the lights were significantly brighter than the faint stars behind them. The row of lights were stationary in the sky and the relative position of one light to the next did not change for the minute I was able to observe it.  Some of the lights appeared brighter than others, but the overall intensity of each light remained the same.  All lights were white and there were between 5 and 7 of them. As I was watching, the lights simultaneously faded away, but the stars in the background remained visible, so this was not simply due to a passing cloud or fog.  There was no sound.;44.4346;-73.0962
Neon blueish flashing light moving around sky.;2019-07-04 21:30:00;30 minutes;Neon blueish flashing light moving around sky. Just before the fireworks, looking west we saw a bright flashing, almost neon blue light moving across the sky.  At first we thought it was a plane until it stopped mid air and hovered for 20 min. or so.  It then reversed direction, disappearing and reappearing.  Several times it increased its speed going much faster than a drone or airplane.  It disappeared again only to reappear seconds later in the eastern sky.  No sound what so ever.
