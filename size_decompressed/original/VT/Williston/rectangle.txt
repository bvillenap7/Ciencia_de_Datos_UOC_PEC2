Block of extremely bright pure white lights similar to baseball stadium/flood lights.;2014-07-19 21:10:00;10 seconds;Block of extremely bright pure white lights similar to baseball stadium/flood lights Sighted a block of pure white extremely bright lights.  The object was very high in the air maybe just below the clouds.   The object looked to be far away but still came across as very large (maybe the size of 3 single-family homes)   It sat stationary in the sky and the lights gave a large bright white star shape luminance.   The object looked almost exactly like baseball stadium lights except much bigger and much higher.   I lost sight of it when I went behind the tree line and when I drive by again it was gone.;44.4346;-73.0962
