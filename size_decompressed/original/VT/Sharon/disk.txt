Saucer w/ ring of white lights hovered very low and made no sound in Vermont;1994-07-15 23:00:00;5 minutes;Saucer w/ ring of white lights hovered very low and made no sound in Vermont My sister and I were playing a board game on the living room floor when I noticed very bright light outside the window. We went outside on the front lawn to check it out and saw a saucer like object hovering only about 75 to 100 feet in the air almost directly over the house. It was very dark out but I believe it was black or grey colored. It had a ring of very bright white flashing lights that wrapped around it. I would guess that the craft was about 20 to 30' in diameter. The object just hovered there for a couple minutes while we stared at it. It made no sound whatsoever. Then while we were still looking right at it the object dissappeared in thin air. We turned around 180 degrees and saw the object again hovering about 100 yards from where we were standing. We never saw it actually move, it just dissapeared and re-appeared in a different area. It did this several times and moved further away each time until it was gone.;43.7745;-72.4213
