Fast moving bright white object and other flashing red and green light object.;2017-09-18 23:00:00;10 minutes;Fast moving bright white object and other flashing red and green light object. I first saw a fast moving, bright white light object that streaked across the sky,  My only explanation in that instant was that it was an asteroid ,but it didn't behave like one:  no tail, no streak.  My view was obscured by the mountain to see where it went.   I immediately noticed to the left of where  a red object/craft in the sky which changed colors.  It went from all red to all green.   I pulled over a little ways down the road for a better view of it and watched it head south through the valley.  It moved straightforward and at a constant speed.  At first glimpse it appeared triangular in shape.;43.3562;-73.1436
