Delta or Vee shaped, silent, travelling west to east from Lake Champlain towards New Hampshire;2005-08-18 19:45:00;2 min;Delta or Vee shaped, silent, travelling west to east from Lake Champlain towards New Hampshire The shape was either triangular or Vee shaped- it varied with the angle of viewing.  Craft was flying high ( a plane from Burlington Int'l Airport took off below it).  The color changed from a whitish silver to having distinct dark lines along the left edge of the craft.  Sometimes it looked like I could see thru the craft.  At some points it seemed camoflaged or invisible against the sky and clouds.   There was no engine noise that I could detect.    The craft was flying east to west along a cloud front that I was observing for signs of scalar patterns.;44.4891;-73.1871
