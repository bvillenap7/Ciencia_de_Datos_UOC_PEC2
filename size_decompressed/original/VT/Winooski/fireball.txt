Over winooski VT 10:17pm 7/9/2014, 2 witnesses. Object looked like a giant fireball. Just appeared at random in the sky at 10:17pm 7/9/2014 over Winooski, VT. 1 object, No noise coming from flying object. Looked exactly like an orange fireball about 1/4 the size of the almost full moon. Watched it move very quickly directly across the sky (never went up or down, just across). It lasted 2-3 minutes and then just disappeared. 2 people saw this. Appeared out of nowhere and disappeared the same way. It was low to the ground, not as high in the sky as an airplane or jet and had NO noise at all. Not even a little bit. I'm scared to death! I never believed in aliens before but now I'm wondering..I already know we sound crazy!  I just hope more people report this sighting.;44.4891;-73.1871
