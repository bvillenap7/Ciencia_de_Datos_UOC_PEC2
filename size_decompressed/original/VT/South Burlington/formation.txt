5 pulsating lights in a line at a 20 degree angle high in the sky over South Burlington.;2013-02-06 17:55:00;2 minutes;5 pulsating lights in a line at a 20 degree angle high in the sky over South Burlington When driving east in South Burlington, all of a sudden I could see 5 lights in a line at a 20 degree angle high in the sky.   As I watched each light took a turn getting brighter, one at a time:  the first light got brighter, then the 2nd, then the 3rd, then the 4th and finally the 5th.  After the 5th all 5 lights immediately disappeared.  I had pulled the truck over to watch and put the window down to listen for sound of engine or aircraft.  There was no sound.
