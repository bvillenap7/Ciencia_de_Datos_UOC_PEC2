flashing light in sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius?  PD));2008-12-25 20:45:00;30 minutes;flashing light in sky We saw the same thing as described below -- facing to the south. We were going to bed and suddenly saw this light.  We watched it for about 30 minutes -- mostly through a set of high-quality naval binoculars. It seemed to be mostly stationary although it also moved slightly. We're on the flight path of the local airport so we know what that sounds like. Additionally, both my wife and I are familiar with military and commercial aircraft.  This was not an aircraft on a approach pattern. It was also about 10 degrees, clear, good visibility. Occurred : 9/17/2008 20:30 (Entered as : 09/17/2008 20:30)  Reported: 9/18/2008 7:59:48 PM 19:59  Posted: 10/31/2008  Location: Franklin, VT  Shape: Unknown  Duration:current Flickering stationary light in sky, upon looking with binoculars also has red, blue, (?green) pulsating lights.  Looking up in the NW sky we first saw one very bright star that appeared to be flickering. Upon further inspection with binoculars, we saw that it had Blue, Red, (?Green), and yellow blinking lights. Looks as though the yellow - white light is in the middle and the other colored lights surround it. Examing the rest of the sky we see 3 more of the same. One in the NW sky, one in the NE sky, one in the SE, one in the SW. The moon is almost full. There are a lot of planes as well in the sky tonight, but these lights are stationary, and they don't blink like an airplane. I saw the first one at about 20:30. Now at 22:42 all 4 are still in the sky. What are they?;44.4537;-73.1773
Yellow Orange light seen in sky in South Burlington.;2015-04-10 19:50:00;100 seocds;Yellow Orange light seen in sky in South Burlington. At about 7:50 pm (19:50) on Firday April 10th me and my girlfriend were heading back from University Mall in south Burlington.  We had just gotten on interstate I89 South via Exit 14-E, it was dark enough were everyone had their headlights on, but not quite enogh to see stars yet.  The treeline was black but the ski was a deep blue.  About 5 minutes after we merger to the interstate I saw a yellowish light low in the sky at to the left of me at about 10 o'clock.  At first I thought it was Jupiter because it was so vividly bright compared to the rest of the sky, and it looked like the first start out.  After looking at it for a second more, I realized it was too orangey yellowish and too bright, and almost seemed to be getting brighter.  After about  30 seconds I can see its perspective changes making it seem like it is much closer than a star, and seems alsmost fixed in the sky over the ridge line maybe three miles away, andaune about 5,000 feet up.   At this point I wake my girlfriend up in the passenger seat and say babe what's that?. She looks at it for a second and says A light on a tower like an airport? but it was not blinking or flickering, was very yellow and Orange, not red like an airport.  Also there was only one light and it was so bright there was a little halo of yellow in the clouds around it so you could see there was no tower below it, and there is no airport south of Burlington. After about abother minute of watching it, it is directly left of us, 9 o'clock, and it just sort of zooms away from us. It appeared to move due east at extreme speed. Seemingly no acceleraton period,'an disappearing over the horizon as quick as you could snap your fingers. I would guess less than 0.1 seconds. That was the last of anything strange I saw on my 2 hour drive south that night. I was watching the sky carefully cause I was so unsettled from what I saw. Me and my girlfriend are both 17 year old highs highschoolers who were in Burlington for the day. Neither of us drink, do drugs, smoke or take any medication. We both felt fine all day and when we saw it, other than my girlfriend just woke up. I have an intrest in UFOs because they raise compelling questions and involve ideas I am interested in, but I have no real knowledge other than a few things on the internet, and convorsations with my Physics and Chem teachers. The only thing I could think of that would be helpful would be that the light was the same exact color as old High Pressire Sodium street lamps. If you know or think of anything that could be helpful or interesting, please contact me.;44.4537;-73.1773
Big blue light above Shelburne Rd. maneuvered in a 90 degree angle then disappeared.;2015-04-21 22:54:00;1 minute;Big blue light above Shelburne Rd. maneuvered in a 90 degree angle then disappeared. Driving to work on Interstate-89 South Bound on the Rutland/Shelburne Rd Exit.  A few cars were in front of me, but I was driving slower so they disappeared over the hill to the point where it was completely dark behind and in front of me.  The brightest blue light I have ever seen appeared out of thin air, fairly high in the sky.   It was a cloudy night and you could not really see any stars so this big blue ball of light stuck out.   Then it shot really fast to the left (my left) abruptly stopped, then fell straight down and disappeared.  It moved so fast in a 90 degree manner that it looked like it had a tail but it was just the light moving so fast that there’s no way it could have been a plane or a shooting star.  I worked at the Burlington Airport for over 3 years no way I can explain what I saw.   Come forward if you saw it, too.  It’s almost surreal.;44.4537;-73.1773
