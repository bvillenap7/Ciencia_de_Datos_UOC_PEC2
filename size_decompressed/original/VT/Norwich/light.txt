Group of lights seen over Thetford, Vermont.;2013-11-20 17:50:00;3 minutes;Group of lights seen over Thetford, Vermont. I was driving north on I-91 when in the direction of NNW I saw four very bright and large lights (I thought it was a meteor) disperse.   They then gathered back to a small, faint blinking light.   Five seconds later, they dispersed again, then vanished.  The faint blinking light began to travel southwest.  I'm guessing the craft was over or near Thetford Center, VT when I saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the correct time might have been 5:50 p.m., 1750 hrs..  However, source of report chooses to remain anonymous, and provides no contact information.  Hence, we are unable to contact the person.  We have amended the time above, so the report conforms to the time of the many other sightings from New England on this date.  PD));43.7389;-72.2967
