To the left another of the same kind of very bright light appears..there were three total and kept appearing then fading away for maybe 30 seconds total.  Few minutes later driving north on Rt 5 Thetford looking left into sky over field, same lights no particular pattern but very bright, appear then fade.   Slowed car to really look, window down, couldnt see anything and there was no sound.  Minute late, what looked like a series of military heat flares dropped down in succession, transponder lights off in distance heading north.;43.7389;-72.2967
