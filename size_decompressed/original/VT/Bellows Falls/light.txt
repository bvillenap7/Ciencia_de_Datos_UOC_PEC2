A star-like object appears close to the sun;2005-03-30 07:30:00;5 seconds;A star-like object appears close to the sun I was sitting on my porch (second floor) watching the sunrise and drinking tea. There were no clouds in the sky and it was about 35-40 degrees F. The sun had been above the hills for maybe an hour when I looked up from my cup of tea and saw a bright white star below and a little to the right of the sun (about 1 inch below the sun from my perspective). It must have been very bright indeed because it was  close to the sun and I was wearing sunglasses, and yet, it was still very visible. It was not moving. After 1.5 - 2 seconds the light faded quickly(it didn't just Blink off, but it still faded very fast). At first I thought it might be a passenger jet that was reflecting the sunlight, but after it disappeared I saw no jet or airplane, there was no white trail, nor was there any sound. About 2 seconds after the first light faded another light appeared (it sort of faded in instead of out) farther to the right of the first position. From my perspective the two object's positions were roughly 2 inches apart in the sky. The second light was just as bright as the first, at the same distance above the horizon, and it was also motionless. It lasted around 1 second, and then faded just like the first one. Again I looked for any sign of an aircraft but there were none. I've lived in this apartment for almost three years, and I sit on the porch with my tea almost every day (except during the winter) and I have never seen anything like this before.
