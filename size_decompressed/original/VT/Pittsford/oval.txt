Large oval light from south traveling off into space;2009-01-18 06:35:00;1 minute;Large oval light from south traveling off into space bright white light very low my son thought it was a jet at first but it was coming accross the horizon level from the south to the NE. It kept a level flight and when it was over the local hills it went straight up until the large white light dimmed out of sight and was off into what appeared to be beyong the stars into space.;43.7124;-73.0174
