Band of 5-8 bright lights tilted and stationary in sky without any dimming, then just gone.;2013-02-06 18:00:00;15-30 seconds;Band of 5-8 bright lights tilted and stationary in sky without any dimming, then just gone. I did a double take of a band in the sky tilted on a slight angle.  It was 5-8 bright lights all stationary and each brighter than the stars that had just come out.  I couldn't fathom what it was but I was driving so I kept glancing at it and it just stayed in position.  I first thought it was a meteor breaking up but there was no dimming of the lights or any sign of a trail- just bright stationary lights.  When I pulled over at a brightly lit gas station, I tried to see it but it was no longer there.  Spooked me.  Felt like a dream.
