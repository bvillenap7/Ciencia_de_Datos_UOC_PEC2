It was fully dark by 9:30 PM and the sky was mostly clear.  I was standing outside, looked up and saw a large, glowing, light greenish, object traveling across the sky off to the south, and my right side.   Immediately, I thought the object was a meteor, but then it was too large and it had no tail.  I have been a sky watcher for a long time and have seen many tremendous meteor showers, but never a meteor this large, if that’s what it was.  It scared me because it seemed to be just above the tops of the pine trees, it was traveling silently and had no tail.  It went over my head and then over the house, traveling toward the north.   Then it seemed to dissipate and there were orange colored sparks behind it or around it, but that’s the only thing that could be called a tail.  The half moon going down in the western sky may have already set, or was behind a cloud, and it seemed almost as large as the half moon, but slightly smaller.   The object was not perfectly rounded in shape, I would call it a smooth blob shape, and there was no sound at all.  I would say the whole episode lasted  approx. 7 to 10 seconds and the object passed over my head so it was directly up in the sky and not close to the horizon at all.;43.1699;-72.8515
