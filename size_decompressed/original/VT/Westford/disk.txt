summer of 98... saucer shaped ufo with bright blue lights sighted;1998-07-10 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;summer of 98... saucer shaped ufo with bright blue lights sighted i was laying in bed ready to pass out. i was on my side and my eyes were half shut. suddenly the room started blinking on and off blue. confused i looked out my window with the fan in it thinking perhaps it was the moons rays reflecting off it... or something.. that was the only half ass explaination i could come up with at the time. Then i turned to the slider glass door... and there in the sky was a disk shaped u.f.o with blue lights flashing around the rims of the craft. About two seconds after i looked at the thing... it shot back really fast behind the tree line and disapeared out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));44.6172;-73.0058
