There was a bright strobe type light emitting from the bottom of the craft onto the forest floor.  I went into the house to call my son to see it and when I came back it was gone.  I saw this same craft the week before in the middle of the night and in the same area and it lasted over ten minutes before it suddenly disappeared from sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she seemed quite certain that she and her son had witnessed something unusual.  We do not know what they saw, but it does sound intriguing.
