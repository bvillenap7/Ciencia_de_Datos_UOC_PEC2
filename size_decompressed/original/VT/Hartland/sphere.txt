((NUFORC Note:  Probable twinkling star.  PD))  Red white sphere.;2005-06-23 02:00:00;1 hour;red white sphere I spotted what looked like a red and white star just over the top of a mountain several miles away. Over a period of one hour it seemed to rise up slowly almost undetectably further above the mountain. It may be that I've stared at it too long or it could actually be moving from side to side. I am currently watching it as I write this. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable twinkling star.  PD));43.5668;-72.4172
