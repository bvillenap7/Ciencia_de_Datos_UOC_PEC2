The lights were also too bright to be any star.  The lights turned red and flashed.  Then it started to move at a high speed that no airplane could match.  Nearest airport is small and would not have airplanes of this size.  If it was a bigger plane heading to the biggest airport in the area, it was heading far more east than the airport.  Too fast for a drone or helicopter.  We opened the car window, if it was a plane or helicopter we would be able to hear it.  But it was quiet.   Also, it was flying really low.  We saw it for about twenty seconds before it flew out of sight.;44.1489;-72.4962
