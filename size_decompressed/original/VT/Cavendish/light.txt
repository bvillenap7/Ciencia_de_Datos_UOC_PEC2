While camping with very little light pollution, object seen crossing the sky from S to N.  Three equidistant white lights moving at the same speed, faster than an aircraft at that height. Watched until we could not focus on the lights anymore (too far and too dim.)  Took about 3-5 minutes to pass.  Other aircraft were visible, and colored lights were visible on those.;43.3763;-72.61
