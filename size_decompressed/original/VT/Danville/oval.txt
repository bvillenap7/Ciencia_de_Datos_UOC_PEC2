Sunday night I watched a slow moving object with a line of lights approaching my house as I stood outside on my front porch.  It was low in the sky and silent.   As it came overhead three of the lights underneath were like the points of a triangle and there were several other scattered lights among them in a variation of colors.   It was gone in a flash and made a brief noise at that point.;44.4361000000001;-72.1107000000003
