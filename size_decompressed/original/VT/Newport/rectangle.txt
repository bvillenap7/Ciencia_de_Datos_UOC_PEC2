Slow moving 30-60+ amber lights heading northeast of Lake Memphremagog.;2014-08-16 22:58:00;5-15 minutes;Slow moving 30-60+ amber lights heading northeast of Lake Memphremagog. To the northeast of Lake Memphremagog my fianc√© was driving home and said that I should come outside.  She told me that she had observed all of the floating amber colored lights for approximately 5 minutes before she arrived home.  I went outside and saw the drifting to the northeast with others entering from the horizon on the northwest.   There were dozens of the amber colored lights and their altitude was below 5000 feet, as it is very cloudy and a little foggy outside.;44.9399;-72.2111
