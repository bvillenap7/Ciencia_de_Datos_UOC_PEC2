Glowing Manta-ray Shaped Object Flies Over Kaysville on a Southwardly Course Parallel to Wasatch Mountains;2002-06-11 00:20:00;10 seconds;Glowing Manta-ray Shaped Object Flies Over Kaysville on a Southwardly Course Parallel to Wasatch Mountains Just after midnight on a clear cloudless night, as I faced east towards the Wasatch Mountains, a dimly glowing manta ray-shaped (or perhaps sideways football-shaped, as it was a bilaterally symmetrical, twin-lobed shape--like two apple seeds glued together with the points facing out) object moved across the sky towards the south. The object had no discernable light source on its surface, and the glow may have been the reflection of city lights. Its air speed was faster than any airplane that I've ever seen to traverse that same distance. >From my vantage-point, as I sat on the ground between two trees, the object flew in a straight line south. It appeared to be the  same size as a pea held at arms-length. Its altitude seemed to be slightly higher than the peaks above Kaysville. This was a quiet evening with little wind, and the object made no noticeable sound. Fifteen minutes later, a passenger jet flew by the same area and jet engines were distinctly heard, even though the jet appeared to be farther away from me than the unknown object had been.;41.0396;-111.9361
