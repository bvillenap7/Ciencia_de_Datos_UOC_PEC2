Highly reflective object floating downward.;2020-04-03 15:45:00;10 seconds;Highly reflective object floating downward. April 3, 2020 I was checking out the rising moon using a spotting scope at around 17:45 on 04/03/20. I have a Visionking 100X30-90 mounted on a tripod that faces East out my picture window toward Francis Peak in the Wasatch Mts. The moon had risen and I was looking at it using 30X when a strange object reflecting light floated in front of the moon and continue to drop toward the horizon at about a 10 or 15 degree angle. When I took my eye away from the scope I could not see it. I watched it drop toward the horizon for about 10 seconds. It was highly reflective. I tried to readjust my scope and then lost it. At first I thought it was a parachutist because it seemed to have something above it and something very reflective below. The moon was at a pretty high altitude, ~ 45 degrees above grade. I have been skydiving before and I cannot believe that someone could have been skydiving at such a high altitude.  Another reason that I thought it was not a skydiver was how reflective it was. I have watched skydivers many times where they jump from the Ogden â€“Hinckley Airport and this was something very different. The object did float downward as if it was connected to a parachute, but that was the only similarity. I do not know what it was but it was very strange. It was not like anything I have ever seen in the sky before. Yours sincerely, JP;41.0396;-111.9361
