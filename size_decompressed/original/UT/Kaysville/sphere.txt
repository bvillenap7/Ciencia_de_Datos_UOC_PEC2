I woke up around approximately 4:42 am, I knew that a snow storm was going to hit sometime this morning so I looked out my window.   There was a round illuminated white sphere hovering in my back yard by my apple tree.  It seemed to hover there for what seemed like 30 seconds before flashing once and then illuminating again.  Ran to tell my husband who was in the bathroom and by the time we ran to the window the sphere had disappeared.   There was no noise.
