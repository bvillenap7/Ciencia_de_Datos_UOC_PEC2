Fighter jet repeatedly flying low and fast over the city of Kaysville around 11:15 pm.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-03 23:15:00;20 minutes;Fighter jet repeatedly flying low and fast over the city of Kaysville around 11:15 pm. Lots of noise, didn't bother my dog in the slightest. My dog started barking around 11:25 pm, so I went out back to see what was amiss, and an unlit aircraft the size of a car and about the same noise level as a small car flew over the neighboring house and out across the fields towards the Great Salt Lake.  It was at a height of about 50-60 feet above ground, moving at maybe 40mph. Hard to make out shape but it looked about like a sedan with arched wings of the middle of both sides.  It was visible and audible for about 30 seconds.  No lights whatsoever on the aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
