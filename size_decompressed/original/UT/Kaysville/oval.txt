2 oval objects in formation traveling at the same speeds.;2020-05-31 18:00:00;30 seconds;2 oval objects in formation traveling at the same speeds. Looking east at the Wasatch mountain range from my backyard in Kaysville, Utah I noticed two silvery jellybean oval shaped objects travelling north at approximately 18:00. They were moving relatively fast compared to a jet liner.  Both were travelling at the same speed judging by the fact that they maintained the same distance from one another as they moved along.  They were separated and offset by a good distance.  I would estimate maybe a mile.  I have never seen anything in the sky that resembled these objects.  Their altitude was very difficult to estimate but was quite high also.  From the distance that I saw them they were both about a Â¼ inch in length to my eye.  They disappeared into the north after watching them for 10 -15 seconds.;41.0396;-111.9361
