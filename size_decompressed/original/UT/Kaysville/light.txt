I live a few miles away from Hill Air Force Base in Utah so hearing jets are a commen occurance.  I was in my kitchen when I heard 2 jets fly a little lower than usual so I looked out the window and sure enough I could see the lights of the jets moving North - North West of my house.  I thought it might be another drill or weapons training that takes place often in the west desert in Utah but further watching them I could see that they must have been following something because of some sudden movements they were making which told me this wasnt a drill, nor an exercise.  I continued to watch when I lost track of the 2 jets and could see a red or reddish orange light sitting in the sky.  I thought it might have been a star because it was fairly small but the night was cloudy so that was out of the question.  The light was just sitting there, very still.  It wasn't growing or shrinking so I knew it wasnt moving towards or away from me, it just stood still.  Then it started to veer south fairly slow and as I could hear a jetcraft in the distance, the light got a little bigger, big enough I could see it changed colors from red to blue and then to yellow.  It started to move a little faster south and started flashing yellow.  I then found the jet moving in from the north behind it and the flashing light dissapeared as the now lone jet moved in a south to south west direction behind my neighbor's house.;41.0396;-111.9361
