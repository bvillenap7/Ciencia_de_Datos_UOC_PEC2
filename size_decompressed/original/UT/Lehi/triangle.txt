Faint, fast moving triangular object with three red lights at each corner over Lehi, Utah;2006-09-23 20:40:00;6-10 seconds;Faint, fast moving triangular object with three red lights at each corner over Lehi, Utah I was outside in front of my house tonight, looking up at the stars and I noticed a very, very faint triangular object with 3 very faint, soft, red lights at each corner of this triangle.  It was moving silently from the South East right over my house to the North West of my position toward the southern corner of Salt Lake City.  I had my wife come and look (who was outside with me), but she could not see it.  It was very faint, but very there. I am still jazzed. This is the first UFO I have ever seen.  There was no way this was a conventional aircraft it was high and moving fast.  No noise...very faint, very fast flying right over the Southern approach pattern of incoming commercial jets bound for Salt Lake International.;40.3938336065574;-111.848722131147
Multiple triangular flying objects seen changing colors and going great distance;2015-04-24 22:00:00;30 minutes;Multiple triangular flying objects seen changing colors and going great distance Around 10:00, we saw a brightly colored green triangular object zoom past our house.  As we watched it, it quickly would zoom in one direction, change direction and go back.   As it flied south-west, it interacted and spun around a red object that looked just like it and the green one then turned red.  The original red one flashed from red to white to yellow as the new red one circled it.   The object in the center then seemed to descend while the other shot off super quickly towards the mountains.   While watching it, on top of the mountain, we saw a huge ball of white lights followed by three more red lights.   One of the red lights shot off into the sky and disappeared while the other ones zoned around in weird patterns around each other. We watched until they all faded away.;40.3938336065574;-111.848722131147
