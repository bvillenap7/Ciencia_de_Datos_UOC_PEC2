Clear , Jellyfish type object;1983-04-30 09:00:00;15 seconds;Clear , Jellyfish type object I was riding in the back of a car with my mother and aunt. I observed something in the sky going very fast and flying very low(about 100 feet). The strange thing about this object was the way it looked. The best way I can describe it is as a jellyfish type thing. It was probably moving at about 70-90 MPH. We didn't get a very good look at it. All I know is it was not something I had ever seen or something I have seen since. I would estimate the size as about 100 feet long and 60-70 feet wide. It could have been a ship of some kind. It was either clear or it was distorting the air around it. I use the term jellyfish loosly because it didn't look like one, that is just a good way to describe the exterior. My mother and aunt looked at each other and asked did you see that?, what was that? and also turned to me to see if I had seen it. Very strange.;40.3938336065574;-111.848722131147
2 UFO's Over Lehi, Utah.;2013-08-22 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;2 UFO's Over Lehi Utah Not sure what I saw... Around 11:00 PM, I was in bed and happened to glance out of my bedroom window to the South and saw what I first thought was a normal aircraft.  As I looked closer, it seemed...irregular.  There was a bank of bright red, blue and green lights on the craft.  There were approximately 6-8 lights, all arranged in a horizontal configuration with a slight triangular positioning.  It passed slow from North to South and slowly banked to the North. Approximately at a height of 700-1500 feet high. While watching it proceed to the North, I noticed a second craft with similar lights, stationary to the East.  The first seemed to be approaching the second.  I opened the window and there was no noise I could discern from either.  I went for my camera, changed the lense and headed outside.  By the time I got outside, both were gone, but a singular white light had begun approaching from the distant North.  I waited and it was identified as a normal commercial Jet.  The lighting was not similar to the previous two. Two years ago I saw and reported on another site a very large, translucent triangular craft moving from the South to the North in this same area over our home...so I keep my eyes open. Our home is just North of the new NSA center in Lehi, and there is a nearby Helicopter base so I am familiar with the distinct differences in the types of Aircraft that overfly this route.  There are helos in the area and they make very audible noises and the commercial jet route also tracks directly over our home or also West of us from North to South or South to North, those are also audible.   These, whatever they were, were clearly different...;40.3938336065574;-111.848722131147
