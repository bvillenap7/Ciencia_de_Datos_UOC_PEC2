On Jan 26, 2011 I walked out of my garage and noticed 3 red lights above my house, slightly SE, and at an altitude that appeared to be above some thin clouds. Each light appeared to be made up of 3 lights in a triangle shape.  The lights were not flashing and were moving away from my location very slowly.  During the time I watched these lights, (About 10 minutes), there were bright white lights dropping from them at irregular intervals.  The white lights would drop approx. 1/3 of the distance between the red light and the ground, and then disappear. There was no sound associated with the red lights or the falling white lights.  These objects eventually moved South, far enough that I could not see them.;40.3938336065574;-111.848722131147
