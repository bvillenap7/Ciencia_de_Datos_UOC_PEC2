Circular light seen over mountains in washington county.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-15 22:00:00;10 minutes;Circular light seen over mountains in washington county I was traveling north on I-15 around 10pm when I saw what looked like a shooting star falling straight down from the sky, but it was brighter and had no tail.  Then the circular light stopped suddenly right above the mountains north of Toquerville.  It hovered for about a minute then started flashing red and blue lights as it got dimmer.  I could see it was in front and lower the mountain ridge.  As I got closer I lost sight because of some trees.  When I did see it again it was moving a rapid pace flying north toward Cedar City.  I observed it for a total of about ten minutes and finally lost sight because of the hills. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
