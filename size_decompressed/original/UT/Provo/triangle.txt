details above;2006-01-05 17:35:00;6-8 seconds;details above triangular object with white lights on each side and what looked like an after burner glow in the rear moving very fast going over my house in Provo Utah.  It was going toward the mountain and then quickly made a sharp turn upward and all the lights went out completely.  There was no sound with this object.  At first I thought it might be a helicopter, but it was moving too fast and there was no sound.  I live near an air force base and suspected that they were testing some new aircraft.  ???  I couldn't track the shape after the lights went out.  It is as if it just disappeared.  I called my friend who is a private pilot and asked him to call the Provo airport tower to see if they tracked this flying object.  They did not have knowledge of this unexplained aircraft.  I have never seen anything like this ever before.  The speed and the ability to make a verticle climb so quickley and then the lights cut out at the same time hiding its presence.;40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
