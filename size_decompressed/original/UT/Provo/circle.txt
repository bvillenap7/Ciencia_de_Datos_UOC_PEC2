White Floating object in Utah County;2001-10-05 13:30:00;15 minutes;White Floating object in Utah County It was a clear day.  No clouds.  I was looking East out of a high rise building.  I saw a white object moving in front of a mountain range.  It was the size of a small plane or helicopter.  The object went up above the mountain and hovered in place.  I had two co workers look to see if they could see it.  We decided it was a balloon.  The only problem was it was not moving.  Then it veered off the the right and then went back to it's original position.  I continued to watch.  The object disappeared then reappeared in the same spot.  Eventually it decended on the back side of the mountain and we couldn't see it any more.  This is the second time we have seen a similar type object.  A few months ago a white object came down a canyon then cased the mountain in a v pattern.  It went up the next canyon then back down.  It stared floating in a straight line and disappeared on the front side of the mountain.  Again, both of the occurances were in the afternoon.;40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
4 'fire balls' over Provo Canyon, Utah.;2013-04-12 17:40:00;90 seconds;4 'fire balls' over Provo Canyon, Utah I was driving home and noticed 3 orange colored balls in the sky.  They looked the color of fire. They were located north east of where I was, almost like they could be over the mouth of Provo Canyon.  It seemed as though they were rising.  From my perspective they were bigger than Chinese lanterns I’ve seen.  The top one ‘burned’ out and the other two started to fade, then another appeared below where the other three were.  After approx 30sec that last one winked out.  They were about twice the size of a star in the sky.;40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
Circle object over Provo Canyon;2020-08-26 05:20:00;30 minutes;Circle object over Provo Canyon At approximately 5:20 am, I got a text from my daughter.  Her husband had taken their dog outside when he noticed the neighbor's dog and theirs barking at the sky. She said to look out the window.  I got up and went outside.  I saw a bright light over Provo Canyon.  At first, I thought it was Venus but saw the light move right and back left.  It had two large shafts of light coming from it, but the circle was also very lit up.  I woke up my daughter to come watch it with me. At one point, the light went completely out but no clouds had passed in front of it.  It was obviously not a star or Venus because it was much larger.  It lasted until 5:50 am and we had taken photos and video.;40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
