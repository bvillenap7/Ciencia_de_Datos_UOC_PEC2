G;1999-01-19 19:05:00;1 - 2 seconds;Observed bright phosphorescent greenish tinted object fall in downward direction behind Maple Mountain which is east of Provo, Utah.  General direction from view point was south east-east.  Object size appeared larger than brighest planet or star.   Size closely approximate to @ 1/16 B-B held between thumb and index finger at arms length.  Duration of event was less than 2 seconds.  I listened for possible impact explosion type noise to get idea of distance but did not hear any impact explosion sound.   The object was probably a shooting star or meteorite, - not anything that could be construed as a UFO. Object probably a falling star.  Color was bright phosphorescent greenish.  Like the brightness of an electric arc only with a greenish tint instead of a bluish tint.  Observer is 51 years old, a college graduate in 1972.  Worked as a welder for 8 years.  Currently works as a non-destructive testing engineer.;40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
