At one point it elongated itself and moved one point to another almost instantaneously. At 00:25 am on May 10, 1997, I was getting into bed and glanced out my bedroom window and noticed a large white 'star' with a yellowish hue to it with a background of the black sky and other stars.   I remarked that I have never seen such a large 'star' before.  It didn't twinkle as the other stars did, which make me even more curious.  Its shape wasn't circular, but rather more a square with concaved side.  (Discription of star shape:  Place a square on one its corners, and its axises both vertical and horizontial, take the circumferencial straight lines and cause them to become concaved towards the center-point where the axises of square meet. )  This was the shape of the 'star'.After looking at the star for about ten seconds, it disappeard.  It reappeard several seconds later to the left of its original position.  The color had changed from the yellowish white to blueish white.  The size had also changed, it resembled more like a regular star size.  Intermittenly the blueish light would flash, although not at regular intervals.  Occasionally (two or three times), a small red light flashed (but not as frequently as the 'white' light) This red light was also irregular in its flashing.  No blue light was ever seen as in regular aircraft lights.The light moved from its '9 o'clock' position to the 'center of the clock' position' and immediately perform a 90 degree turn to the '12 o'clock' position. in a fraction of a second.  There was no gradient climb from the '9 o'clock' to the '12 o'clock' positions, even in the other movements mentioned below.It remained for several seconds in the '12' position, and performed a vertical descent to the '6 o'clock' position.  (No red light flashing)The light continued this movement between the above four points, but never, while I viewed it, move to the '3 o'clock' position.At one point in its movements, from the '9' to the 'center' positions, the object seemed to elongate itself and be at both positions at the same time for only a fraction of a second, and then repositioned itself  from the '9' to the 'center' positions.I decided to get my video camera, and after a quick search of two rooms, found it and returned to the bedroom, but unfortunaltely the light was gone, so I did not get it on video.Total time was about a 1 minute to a minute and a half.;40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
Strange light sits above mountain, and disappears;2001-06-05 03:30:00;10 minutes;Strange light sits above mountain, and disappears It was late at night in Provo, Utah. I was traveling in the passenger seat of my cousin’s car on the way back to my other relatives house. It was a relatively clear night out and there were plenty of stars to be seen. On one side of the road was the Provo Valley, and on the other side the mountains. I could see one star in particular which sat relatively right above one of the highest mountain peaks. It shined very brightly. I figured it was an airplane or helicopter moving towards us from over the mountain. It did not move however. As I sat watching, the star appeared to get brighter but still it did not move. Suddenly, almost as if “it” knew I was watching, the light did almost a complete 180 degree turn and disappeared behind the mountain. It executed this move so quickly that I almost didn’t see it happen. I am absolutely positive it was something not of this world.

Large Orange light gave us chills;2003-10-13 21:00:00;15 minutes;Large Orange light gave us chills My experience: Sighting Event Details: My friend and I were holding an astronomy group for some boys that we work with.  As we were scanning the skies for something worth while to point our 8 and 10 dobsonian telescopes at, my friend noticed an extremely bright light in the western horizon.  We knew it wasn't a planet, as mars was to the south and east of us at the time. At first, we thought it might be an aircraft approaching us and we were just seeing the landing lights. But, the light seemed to hang in the sky south of West Mountain(western side of Utah Lake), so we knew we weren't seeing the various transmission towers on the mountain. The object appeared to hang near or above the area where the town of Eureka is located. My friend trained his 8 telescope on the object, and what we saw gave us chills.  When viewed through the eyepiece, the object appeared to have 6-10 orange lights.  The lights appeared to be arranged in an ellipse. The excitement built between us, and we kept watching the object for a few minutes longer.  After about five or six minutes, the object proceeded north above the western most mountains of Utah valley.  The object moved slowly, and maintained its intensity.  After about fifteen minutes total, the object grew dim, as if it were heading northwest from us, and then disappeared from sight entirely.;40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
White light, glides silently across the night sky…  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a satellite??  PD));2007-01-26 19:40:00;30 seconds;White light, glides silently across the night sky... Family was returning home from dinner, and my husband and I looked up at the stars, because it had been a very hazy day, and it cleared up beautifully, when we both, almost simultaneously, noticed a white light, silently gliding across the sky.   We have seen the same thing before in Mesquite, NV, and Lancaster, CA, and quickly pointed it out to our children.   We were all watching it go across the sky, in a south-easterly direction, as it faded and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  The description seems to us to be consistent with that of a satellite.  However, the ISS did not pass within sight of Provo on this date, according to www.heavens-above.com, so it may have been some other orbitting object.  PD));40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
We saw a mysterious light in the night sky that we cannot explain.;2011-08-20 21:00:00;1 minute;We saw a mysterious light in the night sky that we cannot explain. At roughly 9:05 P.M. Saturday evening, August 20, 2011, two of my friends and I were lying on my front lawn.  One of us spotted a light in the sky.  We all watched it curiously.  It ascended slowly at first like an aerial fire work in slow motion.  It was as bright as a star but more of a yellow-orange color, like a street light.  However it was as big as a helicopter.   My friend, a pilot, even suggested that it was a helicopter with just it’s under lights on, however the lights were not flashing as they usually do.  Then it stopped its ascension and started to fly south, toward us.  It grew brighter and bigger as it got closer.   A minute later it stopped flying south and began again to ascend higher and higher, getting further away and harder to see.   Eventually it was only a shimmer in the night sky, until it vanished into space.;40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929

I yelled to my family to come see and they say the last 30 seconds of it flying across the sky when as fast as it appeared it disappeared.;40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
White light appeared, and disappeared.;2015-07-04 22:00:00;10-12 minutes;White light appeared, and disappeared. A light appeared and hovered in one spot and flashed.  The light was white.  It would disappear and then reappear in another spot in the sky and do the same thing then move back to the other spot.

Astronomical anomaly witnessed in Provo Utah.;2017-05-30 23:25:00;5-10 seconds;Astronomical anomaly witnessed in Provo Utah. I was walking my dog at the condominium complex at approximately 22:25 where I live and saw in the eastern sky what appeared to be a stationary star that started to glow with increasing intensity and brightness for 10 seconds then quickly faded until it was no longer seen amongst the other stars in the sky that night. I wonder if there were any telescopes that captured this anomaly in the eastern sky that evening? ((NUFORC Note:  Heavens-above.com indicates that no flare from an Iridium satellite should have been visible, at the time, and on the date indicated by the witness.

Numerous (23) Lights in the night sky spotted traveling along same patch at high altitude and speed. ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-03 21:27:00;7;Numerous (23) Lights in the night sky spotted traveling along same patch at high altitude and speed with equal spacing. We were oUt for a walk and noticed several bright lights in the upper atmosphere traveling from the SouthWest to the NorthEast at very high speed.  Lights brightness stayed constant indicating self illuminating as sunlight hitting a surface would cause it ot dim once your vantage point changed as they passed overhead, they made NO noise or course changes. Lights traveled in the same direction on the same course separated by 5-10 miles best guess.  A search of Flight tracker at the time showed NO aircraft in the area on that course or altitude.;40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
