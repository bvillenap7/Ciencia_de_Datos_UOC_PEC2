Strange bright cloud moved with car for several miles, then zipped off as silver saucer.;1972-06-16 18:30:00;several min.;Strange bright cloud moved with car for several miles, then zipped off as silver saucer. 1972, moving from Illinois to California. Going south out of Provo, Utah on a 2 lane highway. Notice a strange, bright cloud up off my right front. Seemed close, maybe 1/8 to 1/4 mile. It seemed to tag along for sevetal miles and I started to take more and more interest. All of a sudden this thing takes off, turning into a perfect silver saucer. I couldn't believe it! When I came to my senses I got my camera out of the glovebox and started shooting in the direction of the craft, still driving. The saucer zipped across the desert and way to the west I could see the late day sun glint off the object as it now hovered over mountains in the distance. When my pictures were developed I only had one photo with a glared fuzzy object in it. I am currently looking for someone with digital enhancement equip. to look at it. Now for the final words. I know what I saw.;40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
1972,Utah-small bright cloud,I'm driving south realize cloud is moving,suddenly cloud turnsinto silver saucer and shoots across desert.;1972-07-01 19:00:00;20-30 min.;SUMMARY:  1972, Utah-small bright cloud, I'm driving south realize cloud is moving, suddenly cloud turnsinto silver saucer and shoots across desert. July, 1972, few miles s.of Provo, Utah.  I'm headed south,moving from Illinois to Calif,before dusk,on 2 lane highway,notice small bright cloud up off my front right fender.(1/4 mi.?)  I,m watching it for miles,realize it's moving,  suddenly it shoots off,now it's a silver saucer, up and to the west across the desert.   Some of my family are in a truck ahead of me.  I flash my lights,no use.  I remember a camera is in the glove box.  I'm driving and snapping pictures. Way off in the horizonis a mountain range. The craft stopped and is hovering over the mountains.  It's a long way but the sun is reflecting off from it. The craft is at a 45 degree angle.  I was stunned. When I got to L.A., I got the film developed, had 1 picture with a fuzzy  saucer in it, took it to a photo lab and had them enlarge the fuzzy saucer.  Well, they did not have digital imaging back then and I am leery of releasing the articles.  That was 24 years ago and I still think about it as if it were yesterday.;40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
I realize that it has been 30 years since our sighting (my wife and I)but. hopefully it will be of use to you... we drove to Provo cany;1978-08-15 18:00:00;20 seconds;I realize that it has been 30 years since our sighting (my wife and I)but. hopefully it will be of use to you... we drove to Provo canyon on our way to Provo from Orem (800 North) as we turned south from the canyon intersection we proceeded down the road for about 500 yards when the U.F.O. flew towards us as if it were an approaching vehicle about 100 feet in the air.  the U.F.O. was approximately 50 feet in diameter and was 15 feet tall, gray in color, with lights of differing color around the exterior, it rotated slightly as it flew at a speed of maybe 30 miles per hour. As the craft came directly over our vehicle i was shocked to find that it gave off very little noise, just a pleasant humming sound. There were two vehicle coming to a stop on the opposite side of the road so, i know there were other witnesses to the sighting. I thought of stopping also to observe but, shortly after as i looked up and out of my window, the craft flew straight up and out of sight in the blink of an eye, again, without noise as you would expect.;40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
I was driving Southbound I-15 between Provo and the first Springville exit by myself talking on the phone.  I looked up and out my wind;2010-07-15 10:00:00;5 seconds;I was driving Southbound I-15 between Provo and the first Springville exit by myself talking on the phone.  I looked up and out my windshield and about 50 feet above my car there was an object (much bigger than a bird, but smaller than an airplane).  It was a saucer, kind of like a half oval shape.  There were two or more bright blue lights and it was glowing slightly.  I saw it really close to the freeway (way too close for it to be an airplane), but suddenly I couldn't see it anymore.  I looked in the direction it was flying and I saw something in the very far distance, but I'm not sure if it was the same object or not.

Hovering object during a thunder storm and rain.;2010-08-04 22:00:00;10 seconds;Hovering object during a thunder storm and rain. On the evening of the UFO sighting, my boyfriend and I had just gotten back from picking up a family friend from the airport  (We live an hour and a half away, this UFO was NOT a plane).  Our family friend had told us all the flights were delayed or canceled  because of the thunder storm and severe rain we were having.   While we were standing outside his house in the drive way he saw a really bright light. He said, Come here and look at this.  I was standing where tree branches were blocking my view so I couldn’t see what he was pointing at.  When I stepped closer to where he was standing and looked into the night sky I saw a bright hovering disk (it had a disk like shape but the light surrounding it was rectangle).  It was very bright and looked far away, yet the whole craft was brilliantly lit. It emitted a yellow/golden light in color.  We both stood looking at the flying object until it flew straight into the clouds.  During the short amount of time we saw the UFO, it maintained the hovering position, not moving anywhere, for about 5 seconds.  Then went up a few feet in the air (from our perspective) and back down to the original position.   After this the UFO flew straight up into the clouds at a super fast speed.  It looked like it disappeared. There were no more lights emitting from the craft. This is my first encounter with anything to do with UFO’s or aliens. I can’t explain what I saw. I don't know of any kind of aircraft so bright, has the same shape, can maintain a hover thousands of feet in the air, go at a fast speed straight up and all this during a thunder storm.;40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
I saw a white dot floating in the sky, I came closer I saw a saucer shaped craft flying by with golden or yellow lights and windows;2015-11-20 22:20:00;10:20-10:21 PM;I saw a white dot floating in the sky, I came closer I saw a saucer shaped craft flying by with golden or yellow lights and windows On November 20th, 2015 at 10:20 PM, I was heading home from work on the road in Provo past Arby's with the road that curves and goes to the light, when to the south I saw a white dot moving slowly in the sky.  I wondered if it was a U.F.O or a helicopter but the lights did not blink like a helicopter normally would.   As I drove to it, I had to head east to find somewhere to park with the object appearing and reappearing as the buildings and trees were in front of it at times out of my view. It appeared to be flying ether north or north west.  As I slowed and came closer to it and I saw this weirdly shaped saucer flying slowly by.  The lighting was golden light or lighting that a yellow light bulb would look like.  There were square windows on it going around the craft and it appeared to have these lander things on the side of it.  It went behind another building or tree as I was driving and then I finally parked and saw the white dot of it again flying and it flew in back of a tree.  I drove to a parking lot to try and find it again, but it was gone from my view.;40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
