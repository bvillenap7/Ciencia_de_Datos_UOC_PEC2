Rapid strobe-like flashes behind clouds in the night sky.;2010-07-09 22:00:00;~1 hour;Rapid strobe-like flashes behind clouds in the night sky. Around 22:00 MDT a lightning storm began. At around 22:40 MDT, rapid flashes in the sky started to appear that I could see from an east-facing window on the second floor of my home.  It looked like flashes of light in the clouds, blinking extremely fast like a strobe for a few seconds then stopping, at 3-4 minute intervals between flashes.  They seemed to be behind the thick layer of clouds that covered most of the sky.  I noticed that the television screens in my house seemed to become fuzzier during the rapid flashes.  I spoke to my companion who was on the ground floor who had also seen these flashes from her west-facing window. The rapid flashes slowly got more rare, and came to a complete stop at around 23:30.
