At approximately 12 am on the 2nd of March 2021 I saw a potential craft with a very bright light as it approached coming from the West and approaching to the East in a rising motion.  It approached toward my home in Provo, Utah. Soon then after as it approached I saw the stomach of the object and shape which was a circular/ oval shape with lights running down the middle of it as it appeared to be grey everywhere else. It was big and it flew over the mountain above my home. The sound of it was of 3 motor cycles together. I was surprised that it did not have more sound as of a plane or a helicopter.;40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
