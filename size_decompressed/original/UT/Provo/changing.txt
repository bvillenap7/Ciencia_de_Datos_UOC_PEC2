It did not move away from its spot or position in the sky for the hour I watched.  There seemed to be what looked like other objects coming and going from the orb. It looked like glitter faintly being shot out and sucked back into the orb.  Was not consistent.   Couldn't make out a number of lights on the orb because it seemed to change shape.  The lights would change colors that were on the orb.  Orange, red, yellow, sometimes blue and green. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star, we suspect.  PD));40.2415504424779;-111.653681415929
