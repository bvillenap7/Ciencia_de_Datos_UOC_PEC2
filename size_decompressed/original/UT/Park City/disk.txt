The disc object with bright lights came from the North and disappeared over the mountains to the North;2016-10-20 21:00:00;30 minutes;The disc object with bright lights came from the North and disappeared over the mountains to the North This is a revision per our conversation, 10/25/2016, of a sighting of last week. My grand daughter was in her upstairs bedroom around 9:00 pm.  She was looking out of the north window of which she looks out of every night.  Suddenly a disc object flew past the window about 1/2 mile in the night sky.   She was so startled she didn't take a picture, but screamed for me, her grandmother.  I ran in and saw the back of the object go by my bedroom window.  I ran outside, but only saw the object faintly through the trees.  I ran back inside and stood on my bed and watched it leave the area. We then ran down to the car and drove trying to catch up to it or at least get closer.  We live in the mountains and lost it as it went over the mountains to the North. There was no noise.  A plane and helicopter make a noise. Again, it was a disc, bright lights.  It was not an airplane or helicopter. Just about every night we see lights in the North.  Bright lights.  The object we see just sits still and smaller lights fly up to it and then disappears.  We've sat on the front porch with binoculars for a very long time watching this happen and just are in awe. It was a very weird day.  the sky was covered with chemtrails and they were still in the sky that night, which made it very eerie. I will be submitting my information as my grand daughter, ((granddd=aughter's name deleted)), is a minor.;40.6950285714287;-111.536418367347
Bright lights, Disk, Hangs in the North and East sky every night, White light,;2016-11-03 23:00:00;all night;Bright lights, Disk, Hangs in the North and East sky every night, White light, Peter, I reported seeing this craft along with my grand daughter last week.  The object hangs in the North sky with shining lights.  It is not a star!!!  Last night the light faded and then it shot out a bright white light towards the direction of the window of the room we are in.  It faded again and then shot out a bright white light again.  I tried looking at it with binoculars but it's not good sighting when I'm shaking.  I'm going to try to get a telescope to get a better look.  My husband got involved with the siting last night and agreed it is not a star.   After about an hour I walked into my bedroom and saw the light through the window facing East.  The window is a trapezoid window and high, so I had to climb on the headboard to look out.  The light was there and then looking a little below I saw another one.  This is not our imagination!!!  This is what my grand daughter and I chased last week and it does move.  It is not a plane or helicopter.  This is not a drone!!  Remember my grand daughter saw the disk as it flew past the house.  What we are seeing is real, but God knows what it is.   We are not crackpots!!  My husband is in his 70s, I'm in my 60s and my grand daughter is 18.  We are not weird people!!  We are very normal people who happen to see weird lights in the sky.  What can we do?  Are we the only ones seeing this phenomenon?  I have no photos, but not for trying.  The camera on my phone does not pick up the lights in the dark sky.;40.6950285714287;-111.536418367347
