Very low flying, completly silent, lights flashing, in the middle of town and able to hover perfectly in one position.;1997-06-01 22:00:00;10-20sec;Very low flying, completly silent, lights flashing, in the middle of town and able to hover perfectly in one position. I was sitting on the playset at my sister's friend's house, sitting in sleeping bags and staring up at the stars. It was silent, and then out of nowhere a huge circular object appeared above us, only about 200 ft or so. It stopped and hovered in the same place directly above us, multicolor lights dlashing around the outside edge of the disc and making no sound at all. We all screamed and ran inside, alerting her brother of the news. But when we came out, 30 seconds or so later, it was no where in sight. I still wonder if anyone else in town had seen it, but just hasn't said anything. I now beleive. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Bright laser type lights and a craft in my backyard area last night.;2010-08-26 00:00:00;2 minutes;Bright laser type lights and a craft in my backyard area last night. I was sitting in my hot tub when I saw very bright beams of blue/green light off in the distance zipping around the ground very quickly.   My daughter came outside and I asked her if she saw it.   Then another beam of light appeared directly in front of us.   I told her to go in the house and look out the front window and see if she could see where it was coming from.   She came back out and said she couldnâ€™t see anything.  Then a few minutes later she spotted a round craft in the sky and asked me if it was coming from there.   I looked up and saw the craft and it moved away very quickly.;40.6950285714287;-111.536418367347
