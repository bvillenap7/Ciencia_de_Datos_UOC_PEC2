We saw what appeared to be a white or bright reflective capsule hovering in place.;2017-06-09 14:30:00;30 seconds;We were in a Lyft car, coming up Bonanza Drive, pulling up to traffic light at Deer Valley Drive.   Approx 5 degrees right of our direct view near the peak of the mountain range, we saw what appeared to be a white or bright reflective capsule hovering in place.  We took it to be a helicopter thought noticed immediately that there was no rear tail extension...only what could have been the passenger/pilot cabin.   We discussed for 20-30 seconds, and then the object disappeared in an instant. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides little contact information.
