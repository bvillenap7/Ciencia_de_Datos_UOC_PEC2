Three groups of lights, one had three orange globes in a row, one was binary (two), and one was single, over Park City, UT;2012-08-11 21:45:00;5 minutes;Three groups of lights, one had three orange globes in a row, one was binary (two), and one was single, over Park City, UT My mother, girlfriend, and I were driving home from a dinner out.  As we left the restaurant, I looked up in the sky and saw a grouping of lights that looked very strange.  There were three separate groups of lights.  The most prominent, and unusual one, was a series of three glowing orange spheres, parallel, and seemingly spaced evenly across.  Not far from this first light was a second group of two lights, both yellow-orange.  To the left of this one, there was a third single light. I pointed these lights out to my girlfriend and mom, and we spent some time talking about what they could be.   At first, we thought they could possibly have been on a mountain, but as we continued driving closer, we realized that they were likely too high to be on one.  As we drove, the single light disappeared.  Then, a few moments later, the group of three orange lights also disappeared.  My mom commented that there was only one &quotgroup&quot of lights too.  Suddenly, they too disappeared.;40.6950285714287;-111.536418367347
Flare birds.;2012-08-26 19:30:00;3-5 minutes;Flare birds I was in my inlaws condo and saw a storm approaching.  Underneath the storm clouds about a quarter mile away there were these lights in the sky that were flying as birds fly.  My wife and I could see wings on them that were black but the body part was as bright as a flare but was the color  of a flame of fire.  We were on the second story of our condo and there was a lady walking below.  I asked here if she was from park city and she said she was.  I then asked if she had ever seen anything like that and I pointed to the lights.  She stood looking in amazement and said she had not.  Next one shot across the sky and then went back with the other ones and they disappeared not really in the distance but in thin air.
