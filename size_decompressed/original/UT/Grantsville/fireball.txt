Green Ball with a trail of fire behind it.;2000-08-16 22:50:00;10 Seconds;Green Ball with a trail of fire behind it. There was a green ball with a trail of flames behind it. It appeared to be going down then there was a flash in the sky. I went to get abetter look ans saw that there was emergency vehicles heading towrds where it appeared to have gone. I also saw several airplanes flying around, I would say there was about 4 to 5 different aircraft flying around. This happend in a small town about 40 miles from Salt Lake City. It was weird. Very big compared to the shooting stars you see once in awhile.;40.5985;-112.4591
