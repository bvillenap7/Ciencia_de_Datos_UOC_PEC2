Craft hovered and then fled south-west where it ascended.;2018-08-16 20:38:00;8 minutes;Craft hovered and then fled south-west where it ascended. At 20:38 while sitting on an overlook at Dry Canyon park in Lindon, Utah, my companion alerted me to a black object sitting high in the sky over the city.   Initially, we questioned whether it was a powered hang-glider, but it was hovering in a way that was abnormal. The craft was hovering and rotating but not moving in an particular direction.  It seemed to be diamond shaped, but was too far away to tell for sure.  Its altitude was far higher than planes that we saw passing after.   After hovering for roughly 3-4 minutes, the craft headed south-west over the lake for another 3-4 minutes, when it ascended and disappeared in the clouds.;40.3409;-111.7159
I saw it very low like about 20 ft above the light pool, with a lot of lights on the bottom.

It followed the same path as mine around about 2-3 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.3409;-111.7159
