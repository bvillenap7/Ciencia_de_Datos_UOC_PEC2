The light, which appeared in the southwestern sky moved slowly, the way a passenger jet moves across the sky.  After about 30 seconds the light suddenly got brighter as the object broke into two pieces.  It was like witnessing a crash.  At that point both pieces appeared to be burning up with a red and orange color as the object broke apart into tiny pieces.  The best description is a firework in slow motion.  It was something breaking up as it entered the atmosphere, like a satellite.  Over a period of 50 seconds, the object broke apart trailing red light as it moved across the sky in an Eastern direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Chinese rocket re-entry.  PD));40.3409;-111.7159
