They appeared from out of nowhere in the sky and reach approximately 1,000 ft.  They travel in an eastward pattern for about 5 - 10 minutes then disappear.   They don't appear to be floating because they sometimes change directions a bit as they go. We saw the same objects about 4 years ago over Sandy, Utah.;40.3409;-111.7159
