Meteor or fire ball falling from the sky just north of Mona, Utah;2014-03-24 21:30:00;4-5 seconds;Meteor or fire ball falling from the sky just north of Mona, Utah I was driving north on the 15 fwy just out of Mona, Utah, late tonight, and witnessed what I thought was burning debris falling from the sky toward the ground on the west side of the fwy.   It fell fast and the flame was visible for a good 3 to 4 seconds, then it burned out.   I suspect it may have been a meteor as the area is known for them, but it seemed to be rather large.  I hope there wasn't anything on the ground where it struck.;39.8413;-111.8472
