5 white orbs cover distance.;2014-10-02 13:30:00;1 hour;5 white orbs cover distance A total of five white orbs, lined up in half-circle, were seen above the point of the mountain just about mid-day in clear, blue skies.  They would slowly increase distance from one another, and remain still again.   They were either moving far away from us, or left/right.  They did not move up or down.  Continuously moved further apart from one another.   We are very close to the NSA building.  Hmmm. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
