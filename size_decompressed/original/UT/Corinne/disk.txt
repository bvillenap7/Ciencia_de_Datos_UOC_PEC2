As I looked outside from my bedroom window, the sun was derectly above the roof overhang.  From the West came the very bright object that moved quicker than a bird to the east. It clearly was not a bird nor a plane as it moved up and down as it moved east.  It disappeared from sight going in an upward arch.;41.5471;-112.1469
