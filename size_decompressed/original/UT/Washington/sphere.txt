Mirror sphere being pulled smoothly across the sky;2020-04-19 01:07:00;6 seconds;Mirror sphere being pulled smoothly across the sky Sphere shape with dark mirror like reflection in the center of the sphere. We saw it move exactly South to North across the sky. Approximately .25 miles to .75 miles above the ground.  It had light reflecting and bending across the front of it while it seemed to be pulled smoothly in the direction going northward.  We recently purchased a telescope and we were stargazing watching the Lyrids meteor shower looking near the star Vega.  It came above our roofline and we saw it because of the light bending across the front of it and thought it was a shooting star but watched it move smoothly across the sky for about 5-6 seconds until it disappeared across another roofline.  It was smaller than an airplane about the size of a car.  No noise was made.  No flashes were made, just reflections around a perfect dark sphere.;37.1325;-113.5041
