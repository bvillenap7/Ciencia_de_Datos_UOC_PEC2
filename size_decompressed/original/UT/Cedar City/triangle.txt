It was long getting larger from front to back, black,50 feet up and made no noise.;1977-06-15 13:00:00;15 sec;It was long getting larger from front to back, black, 50 feet up and made no noise. About six of Nat. Guard Hellicopters were going on a fishing trip in the high mountains of Utah during our 2 weeks and I was going up stream from the other guys, we were on the ground now.  The stream was lined with trees so my view was quiet limited.  A craft passed in front of me a hundred yards or so right on the deck {50 feet off the ground}, It was black and made no noise at all. It was long, 100 feet atleast, like a dart.  I did see this and you can take it or leave it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.6771;-113.062
