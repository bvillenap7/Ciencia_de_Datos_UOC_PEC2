It passed over north of Cedar City, UT after dark and streched from the north east all the way across the sky to the north west moving slowly in that direction. I was in a quiet location and could not hear any noise. After the event I called a friend on the local Police Dept. who said he also witnessed the event and he said there was lots of calls into dispatch reporting the event.;37.6771;-113.062
