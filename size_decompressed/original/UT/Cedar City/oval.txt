Not sure what we saw however are  curious as to what we have seen. We do have video of three the first night 03/15/2013.  I went out on to the front porch at my parents house to let the dog out, I saw a strange light moving across the sky, it appeared to be on the mountain road but did not turn where you would have run out of road.  I had my dad come to look at it as it was flying he caught the tail end of the first one, and my brother came to see what the commotion was about. it had disappeared to the north sky.  As I was describing where it had came from another appeared out of the same area and we also caught it on video, looking at the video run time was 40 plus seconds and it was out of sight south to north, then the third appeared and was as described.  The next night was the same exact thing except that the time was 21:00 hrs, and there was only one at the time. We were talking  on the front porch ready to leave and heard a rumbling boom, there has been l! ots of these boom and rumble for weeks, and my brother said to us look there it is again!! same as the night before south to north.  The objects were all orange ball shaped or oval bright orange and traveled at a high rate of speed no sound except for the second night as described, the only time you could hear jet sounds was when there we jets flying in the sky. It was a flying object because the mountain behind the object is snow covered and then past the other mountain ranges. but was as low 7500 feet to be seen in front of the mountain ranges.;37.6771;-113.062
