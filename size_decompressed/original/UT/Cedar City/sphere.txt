Bright Orange sphere. The location of sighting was 6 miles west of Cedar City, Utah.   On the evening of February 11, 2014 between 23:45 and 24:00 hours, I observed very bright orange spheres appear and disappear 270 degrees west about 10 degrees above the western horizon.  The first 6 objects were about the size of a tennis ball.  They would appear and disappear at the same spot above the horizon.  They would appear and disappear about 1 to 2 minutes apart and within 5 degrees of each other.  They did not rise and fall like throwing a ball into the air.   They appeared 7 different times.  The orange objects appeared to be very far away (50+ miles).   During the middle of the appearances I heard and felt a sonic boom.  It shook our house.  That was the only noise I heard. The last time the bright orange light appeared it was much closer and 20 degrees above the horizon and moving slowly Southwest to Southeast.  It first appeared about 235 degrees in the southwest.  This time I could see behind the bright orange sphere a long tail of orange embers trailing behind.  The embers didn’t appear to be falling but they just trailed off directly behind the object sort of like a comet.  This time the light was pulsating for 10-12 seconds and then it went dark.  It was about the size of a basketball thus it appeared much closer and brighter than the first 6 sightings. I called the Iron County Sheriff’s office to report it and see if anyone else had seen it.   Apparently I’m the only one who observed it. Almost exactly an hour later at 1:48 Mountain Standard Time two jets flew over one directly behind the first.  They came from exactly where the first 6 orange lights first appeared to the west and flew directly northeast on a 45 degree bearing.;37.6771;-113.062
