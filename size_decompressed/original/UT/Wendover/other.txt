The;2012-02-16 07:45:00;20;2 black objects were seen seen hovering several miles north of I-80 eastbound in the early hours on Thursday, February 16th, 2012.  They appeared to be about a mile apart, and the same shape.  The shape appeared to be similar to a zeppelin with the rear end of a conventional aircraft's tail section.  They did not move at all.  In relationship to distance, these objects were much too large to be a twin rotor helicoptor, and too uniform in shape to be clouds.  The same object was also documented on 02/20/12 in almost the same location at 3:15 pm.  The same exact shape and never moved.  Was seen for about 30 minutes by two witnesses.;40.7346;-114.0404
