Black object in sky over lakeside military area in Utah.;2011-10-14 20:30:00;17 min;Black object in sky over lakeside military area in Utah. Driving west on I-80 to Wendover, to the north by lakeside military area we observed a black object in the sky that changed shape.  No lights and was stationary.  My boyfriend and his mother and myself observed it as we drove along for about 17 minutes.  This was the second time in two months that we have seen this same object in the exact same place at about the same exact time. First time was august 26 2011.  I am retired and my boyfriend works for a union.;40.7346;-114.0404
