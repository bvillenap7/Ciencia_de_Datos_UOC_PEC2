Huge dark Triangle in West desert sky;1998-06-01 21:30:00;10minutes;Huge dark Triangle in West desert sky I don't remember the exact date, but it was summer of 1998. My friend had come for a visit to Salt Lake and my boyfriend and I wanted to take him to a casino out in Wendover, NV (appox 120 miles west of Salt Lake). IT was a dark night with a semi full moon in the south east sky.  WE passed the Aroginite Exit on I-80 and we saw lights in the distance coming towards us. Same side of the freeway as the moon. As we got closer we all started making comments, like What the heck is that.  It was huge and dark, but had 3 very big bright white lights on the front that went on and off. The lights where in a row, spaced apart pretty far. The 2 at each end would go on for a few secs then the middle one would come on. It was so weird.  My boyfriend wanted to pull over and take a look at it.  Me and my friend said do not stop the car. We were very freaked out.  Other people on the freeway, I know, saw what we saw. There were truck drivers and everything. My friend was in the back seat and had the window down as we passed.  He said it was the shape of a triangle.  Whatever it was it was huge and kinda flat. I will never forgot the lights and how they turned on and off in a strange sequence. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));40.7346;-114.0404
