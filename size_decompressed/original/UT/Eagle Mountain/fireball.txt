Walked out of the Holiday/Chevron gas station in Eagle Mountain (the ranches) when my friend and I saw 2 glowing orange/red balls of light in the sky to the west of where we were standing.  Possibly about a mile or so distance between us and the lights not really sure it was hard to gauge the distance.  The floating light's were moving upwards and slightly north but after a few minutes we started to drive away from the Holiday and we lost sight of the glowing balls of light.;40.3833;-111.9895
