E.T. in orb form?;2015-09-03 22:14:00;1 second;E.T. in orb form? I was in Meditation in an attempt to invite Extra-Terrestrial beings while in my meditation I heard small footsteps and almost like a tap on the fence which was about 6 or 7 feet away from me accompanied with a very deep breathing that was a bit different from what humans typically make even when attempting to breath a bit deeper.  A swoosh of air went over me I could barely feel that is when I heard the breath one last time and at the end of the breath I heard my motion activated night vision camera go off. The camera was about 5 feet away or so.  This camera will only go off on its own when an object is within 20 feet or less with the settings I had on. It is in three round burst mode which is why the first three are within seconds of eachother. The fourth picture is the orb a little closer and for the fifth I edited and put a selective focus on the features at the top of the orb.  Opinions on what you see are welcome even if you see nothing! It may appear to some it could be! a celestial orb however, I disagree simply due to the fact when a celestial being appears the face or certain features appears to be inside the orb.  I personally have not seen anything like this before though so maybe I have something misconstrued within our spirits as human beings.;40.3833;-111.9895
Single light zipped across the sky;2019-10-28 07:10:00;20 seconds;Single light zipped across the sky Myself and another party saw a single, small light (with no sound) coming from the North, heading South, high up.  It passed in such a short time across the entire skyline from North to South in about 20 seconds.  It seemed to keep the same speed and direction with no variation.;40.3833;-111.9895
