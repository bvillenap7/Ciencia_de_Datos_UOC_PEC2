Floating silver object over Utah.;2007-08-18 17:00:00;5 minutes;Floating silver object over Utah. While driving on my way back from Bryce, Utah, the sky was unusually blue and cloudless and needing to take my eyes off the monotonous road for a few moments, I looked up at about a 30 degree angle so I could still keep an eye on my driving. I spotted a silver object hovering in the sky. Taking it for a plane, I returned my focus to the road. But within a few seconds, I glanced up again to see where the plane had moved to and it was still in the same spot. I watched it with full concentration, thinking perhaps it was a plane flying toward me, so it would soon get bigger as it approached. But it didn't. It stayed in the same exact spot. As I observed it longer, I noticed it was round in shape, not long and thin like an airplane and bright silver against the sky. I had to return my attention to driving again but when I returned my gaze, thinking the unidentified object was probably gone, it was still there. This charade lasted about five minutes. I literally blinked and it had vanished. I searched around the sky as thoroughly I could but it was nowhere to be seen.;37.3216;-112.6011
