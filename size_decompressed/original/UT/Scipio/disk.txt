Circular disk blinking very brightly with a bluish tint sighted next to I-15 just north of Scipio, UT;2006-11-22 19:30:00;60 minutes;Circular disk blinking very brightly with a bluish tint sighted next to I-15 just north of Scipio, UT My friend and I were traveling North on I-15 somewhere between Scipio and Nephi when we say a very bright blinking light with a bluish tint to it.  The light was approximately 50 feet in the air, just to the left of the side of the oncoming traffic, and was stationary.  As we approached the object I could see that it was a circular disk and that it had a light running around the circumference of the disk, about halfway between the center and the exterior of the disk.  This light in some places had both blue and green colors in different locations.  After we passed the object I continued to watch it in my rear view mirror until it was out of sight.  As we were approaching and leaving the object it would separate into two and sometimes three objects.  The separated objects would also blink in unison with each other.  After only about a second at the most these separated objects would then instantaneously combine back into one object again.  As soon as that one was gone we both sighted another object similar to the last one, only this object was much higher in to sky and we were unable to see much detail.  This object was also blinking and was not moving.  After we passed this object we sighted another one, and continued sighting more as we moved along the freeway.  I'm guessing that we sighted around 10 of these objects, but it could have been more.  We did not take a picture of the first object, but my friend did get some pictures of the other objects. The pictures were very blurry, but we could make out a circular disk in the images.;39.2497;-112.1114
Single Saucer flying over highway in Utah.;2020-11-25 06:00:00;5 min;Single Saucer flying over highway in Utah. Driving south on I-15 about 5 min south of Scipio, Utah. Saucer traveled from west to east over highway,  about 200 ft above the ground. It had a single row of bright lights around the center. It appeared for about 5 min before disappearing over the mt range. Saucer was seen by my 13 yr old daughter, 6 yr old son and myself (36). I have been an aircraft maintainer for 17 yrs in the Air Force. This was not a military or civilian aircraft.;39.2497;-112.1114
