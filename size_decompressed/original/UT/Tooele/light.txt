saw a light moving in random directions.....;1999-08-06 04:00:00;3 to 5 minutes;saw a light moving in random directions..... Me and 2 other friends went out west to Tooele to watch a meteor shower. We had already been there an hour or so. I was looking straight up at a cluster of stars. A couple minutes had passed when finaly I had saw it. It was a white light about as bright as the stars. I saw no shape just a light. Too far away. It was moving in different directions kind of like a fly. I then told my 2 friends to take a look and then pointed in the objects direction. One friend thought it was possibly a satilite untill he watched longer. The weirdest part was the movement it moved in almost a figure eight. If I remember correctly. The I went to get my binoculars to see if I could get a closer look. By the time I got back it was gone. Not sure what you want for backgound info. but:I'm 23/Male lived in Utah all my life. No illnesses. I'm not on any medication or drugs. I work at nights for a film developing company so paying attention to little details is my job. No religion preference...

My 9 year old son was looking out of our kitchen window and asked me if I had seen the lights that had passed by the window, and I did;2015-08-04 21:30:00;2-3 seconds;My 9 year old son was looking out of our kitchen window and asked me if I had seen the lights that had passed by the window.  I did not, but he described them to me as 7 yellow lights grouped together in two groups, each light was shaped like pentagons and grouped in the shape of a pentagon.  He said they were bright yellow and one group passed and then another right after.   He was very scared.   It only took a few seconds for them to pass.;40.5452;-112.2973
Flashing, color changing lights in the sky witnessed from Tooele, UT.;2018-02-23 22:30:00;Current;Flashing, color changing lights in the sky witnessed from Tooele, Utah I sat down in my garage to have a cigarette, when I noticed a bright, rapidly flashing light in the sky over Butterfield Canyon (possibly further East) that was moving at about the speed of a plane headed Northwest.  I immediately knew that it wasn't a plane or helicopter because the color of the light was changing between white, red, blue, green, orange and possibly purple.  I also noticed 3 white flashing lights one on each side and one above the main light described. I ran thru the house to my front door, stepped outside and attempted to capture video, but wasn't able to capture what I was seeing accurately.  By this time the craft had stopped moving, hovering in one place and the 3 surrounding lights were no longer visible.  The main light continued to flash and color change rapidly, showing a bright red roughly every 30-45 seconds.  It then began to dim and seemed to be slowly moving East.   I yelled for my fiance, who also witnessed the strangeness of this craft. We watched together for about 15 minutes but decided to go back to the garage where we watched it until it changed direction again, now moving Southeast until it was hidden from view by a large tree.  We went inside to go to bed. I've never witnessed anything like this before.  I'm positive it wasn't anything of human origin because of the movement, colors and total lack of sound as it moved and hovered.  I'd certainly love to know what it is though!;40.5452;-112.2973

((Starlink satellites));2020-03-21 06:37:00;Morning;On the morning of March Twenty One 2020 I had woken up at 6:35 in the morning I had walked outside and look in the sky and I seen what look like the space station like moving from north to south as I watched the light I thought it was the space station the light was traveling a lot more faster than I normally seen the space station travel I watched it move across the sky towards the South I look to the right and saw another light moving across the sky as the Frist one I was immediately suspicious then when I seen the second light so I watch them both move across the sky towards the South I looked towards the right and seen another one so now I'm watching three lights move towards the cell I live in Tooele so they were moving from the West I'm looking to the West thing and then I look over to the right and I see a fourth of fifth of six I watched a total of 32 of them what was bizarre it was that the last two that I seen were extremely close to each other tra! veling from north to south I watched him for approximately 10 minutes Watch32 lights travel across the sky this morning it was absolutely mind-boggling and I know that they we're not the space station and it wasn't just a satellite it was something else when I seen the eighth one I ran into the house and woke my wife up to have her come witness what I was seeing so we both watched it it was unbelievable;40.5452;-112.2973
