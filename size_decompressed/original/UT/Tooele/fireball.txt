Ball of light with helicopters in persuit.;2002-07-10 01:30:00;1 minute;Ball of light with helicopters in persuit. A friend and I were camping out near a local resevoir named Settlement Canyon when we seen what we at first thought was a shooting star. It was not very big and was a deep orange/red color. It suddenly halted directly above us and we heard helicopters coming over the mountain behind us. The ball turned left and headed west very quickly with 3 or 4 helicopters right behind it. They headed off into the distance and we lost sight of them behind some trees.;40.5452;-112.2973

Outside jumping on tramp and witness1 said Look three shooting stars!, then witness2 said No thats like fifty! Look at the shape! Then it dissapeared after 5-7 seconds. Witness3 just watched and said how cool it was. It was very high and very fast, higher than any airplane and we could see it from the ground. It was almost exactly over the house, and was way out of sight within a couple seconds. The approximate shape was: .... .    . .    . .  . ..;40.5452;-112.2973
