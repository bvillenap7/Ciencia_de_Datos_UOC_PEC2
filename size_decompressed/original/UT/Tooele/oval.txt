Blimp shaped craft near I-80 west of Tooele near Lackside/UTTR.;2012-04-06 17:00:00;10 minutes;Blimp shaped craft near I-80 west of Tooele near Lackside/UTTR. As we wre driving west bound on I-80 toward Wendover Nevada my friend and I spotted two craft northwest of the Lakeside Military complex.  One appeared to be lighter in color than the other.  They were in the shape of a blimp and were approximately the same size other than the back end appeared to be more square than a blimp.  They moved very slowly.  Eventually we could not see them anymore.;40.5452;-112.2973
