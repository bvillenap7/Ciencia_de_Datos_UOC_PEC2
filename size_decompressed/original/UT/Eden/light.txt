Lights taht lokked like stars.;2014-04-14 22:00:00;20-30 minutes;Lights taht lokked like stars I have been working swing shift for about 5 months, for the past 3 weeks I have noticed there are not as many stars visible and it seems much darker on my way home from work 130 am. Tonight I stayed home from work, when I looked out the window around 10 pm, I saw 9-10 bright stars, 3 of them were in a row formation.  I looked at them for a minute or two, and noticed they were flashing and moving slightly. I yelled for my daughter and husband to come see.  The outer lights were flashing periodically blue and white.  a few were flashing orange.  One flew through the sky flashing slowing with a bright white light-looked like lightning.  My husband said it was a plane, both me and my daughter said a plane does not flash that bright, nor fly that in that manner.  The lights were all above mountain-but looked like they were far away.  With the brightness of the moon the sky was brighter than I expected, more like early evening. I honestly thought it look like those lights were an outline of something invisible, like a ship- or webbed together.  It also appeared that the webbing was becoming smokey clouds.  After twenty minutes or so they faded away and the sky  became darker than dark-again, even with the bright full moon.  We tried to video tape with my daughters IPAD, it just looked like blurry lights.  My husband looked through his binoculars and could see them flashing.  Makes you wonder if they are protecting us, watching us or if its our imagination. Just very strange and I am not sure what to think as Im writing this I looked out the window a saw a flashing orange and white light go straight up then awkwardly continued upwards like wiggling.;41.3329;-111.863
