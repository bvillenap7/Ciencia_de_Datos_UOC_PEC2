This sighting was in the western sky. The second sighting was made by all of us.  We were admiring the beautiful stars in the very dark sky.  We stopped the car when we noticed 4 blinking lights in a square formation.   These were not stars as they proceeded to change shape into 4 blinking lights in a straight line.  We observed the awesome sight and thought it best to get back into the car and move along as it was very dark and we were in the middle of nowhere.  We were traveling close or in the Dixie National Forest.  This UAP was above what an airplane would be able to reach, so we don't believe it was an aircraft.  This UAP was in the Northeastern sky.;38.1812;-112.2321
