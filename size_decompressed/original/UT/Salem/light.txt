3 orange lights over Salem, Utah.;2014-12-28 19:10:00;5-10 minutes;3 orange lights over Salem Utah I was outside using my snow thrower, when I observed 3 orange lights traveling south, then abruptly they turned east in unison, they were under the clouds.   At my location we are approx. 6500 ft, the cloud cover was below the mountain tops of approx 8500-9000 feet.  They were traveling at a very slow speed, appeared to be coming from elk ridge/Payson area.   They reach about and 85 degree angle when all three climbed above the clouds as if to clear mountains.  I had shut off my machine, and there was no sounds.   As they were almost overhead they were the same glowing orange light, but had grow large in size.  There were no navigational lights as required by FAA regulations, and no bright landing lights, only a glow that showed equally not directional.;40.0072;-111.6031
