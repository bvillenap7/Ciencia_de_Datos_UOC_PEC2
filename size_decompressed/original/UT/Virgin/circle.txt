Round Bright light over the Arizona Strip.;2016-10-27 06:30:00;20 minutes;Round Bright light over the Arizona Strip. We saw a bright light, that seemed to be a circular shape, in the South-West sky, Arizona Strip area.  The light was very bright compared to any planet or stars.  As we watch the light it would fade to almost nothing then come back to full brightness again.  This is the second time we have seen the light.  The first time was a week ago, and the sky was completely overcasts that night.  We took some pictures and video however they are not good.  Camera is just not good enough to capture what we see.;37.202;-113.1841
