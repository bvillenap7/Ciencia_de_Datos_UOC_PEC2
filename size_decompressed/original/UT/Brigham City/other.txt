VERY LARGE GLOWING OBJECT HOVERED TO THE WEST OF THE SALT LAKE DISAPERING AFTER ABOUT 3 MIN;1997-10-15 03:00:00;3 MIN;VERY LARGE GLOWING OBJECT HOVERED TO THE WEST OF THE SALT LAKE DISAPERING AFTER ABOUT 3 MIN MYSELF AND A FREIND WHO WAS WITH ME AT THE TIME WERE TRAVELING WEST FROM LOGAN UT TO BRIGHAM CITY THROUGH THE CANYON. AT THE MOUTH OF THE CANYON ON THE WEST SIDE WE CAME AROUND A CORNER WHERE WE COULD SEE ACROSS THE LAKE. AS SOON AS WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THE LAKE WE ALSO NOTICED A VERY LARGE OBJECT HOVERING IN THE AIR WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING I STOPED THE CAR AND TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS AND WE WERE BOTH AWARE THAT THE OTHER WAS SEEING THE SAME THING WITHOUT TALKING TO EACH OTHER. WHAT WE SAW WAS A VERY LARGE OBJECT THAT WAS GLOWING ORANGE IN COLOR WHICH WAS APX. ABOUT 1/2 LONG AND APX. 100-200 FEET TALL AS WE WERE WATCHING THE OBJECT HOVERED FOR ABOUT ABOUT 2 MIN THEN SLOWLY AND WITH CONTROL LOST ALTITUDE UNTIL IT WAS GONE BEHIND THE MOUNTIANS TO THE WEST OF THE SALT LAKE AND ALL THAT WAS LEFT TO SEE WAS THE AORA OF THE GLOW FROM THE OBJECT FOR ANOTHER MIN OR SO THEN WAS COMPLETLY GONE. AT THE DISTANCE I WAS AT FROM THIS OBJECT AND THE SIZE IT APPEARED I ESTIMATED IT TO BE ABOUT 1/2 TO 3/4 OF A MILE LONG.;41.5073000000001;-112.0167

Me and my brother were out parkouring when I noticed 2 red light going around in a circle.   We continued watching as the moved in the air for about 3 minutes then stopped.   We then noticed 3 more bright orange lights come from the bottom of the mountain going straight up and fast.  Then one by one they proceeded to fade out from our view.;41.5073000000001;-112.0167
