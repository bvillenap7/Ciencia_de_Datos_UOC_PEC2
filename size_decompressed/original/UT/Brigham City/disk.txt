This report may be long overdue but I can recall it as though it occurred last summer.   It was mid August 1975. I was watching over and taking care of chores at my stepfather and Mothers 22000 acre Beef cattle and Quarter horse ranch.  My stepdad had gone to our summer range at Greys lake Idaho to ride through the herd at that place.  The ranch where this event occurred is a remote Desert mountain ranch in northwestern Box Elder County, Utah.  There is not, nor ever has been any electricity at this Fort ranch.  It is isolated and even now quite primitive.  The 15th of August 1975 was very dry and very hot.  It was about 90 to 95 degrees F. at just before 12 midnite.        My mother was home, 80 miles to the east of where I was, she at our Logan Utah guest ranch, located on the Logan river..  The crickets at the Promontory Fort Ranch were chirping very rapidly outside the Bedroom window.  One can calculate about how hot it is by the speed that crickets chirp. that and I had inside-outside thermometers.   I was laying on the bed in the houses only bedroom reading a book.  The ranch cowdog  a Border collie was plopped down right next to me on the rug to the side of the bed.  I was reading by the propane powered lamp on the wall above my head.    I was 22 years old at the time,and I had 20/10 vision in both eyes.  This ranch is located 20 miles south by southwest of Thiokol Chemical Corp, where several stages of Intercontinental missle boosters and their propellant was made for the United States air force in support of continental defense/strategic Nuclear weapon systems, and later on, the NASA space shuttle solid rocket boosters. (1950 to 2005)  Now known as ATK space  systems and related subsidararies     The crickets stopped chirping.  The dog started fidgeting.  The dog started whimpering then whining this eerie mournful, pitiful cry, it got intense.  The poor animal began to exhibit terror at someone or something that was approaching. absolutely panic stricken.  Then, it started to paw and dig into the wallpaper and plaster of the rooms corner.  It tore clear through to the lath and was frantically pawing to get through even that.  I could not hear any sound, except for the freaked- out dog.   Then the horses started to act up and they became terribly agitated.  The horses whinnied and snorted.  They squealed and stampeded around the round corral that they were in next to the barn.  The barn was south of the ranch house and slightly below the main house about 20 yards away from me.   There were four saddle horses all of them geldings.  All of them gentle, with no previous signs of skittishness or jumpiness.  These working cow cutting horses were about as Bombproof, bullet proof dog-gentle-reliable as a mount could get.  At least before this incident.   They were desperately trying to get out of the corral and could not quite jump over the tall fence made of upright railroad ties.  I remember thinking that a rocky Mountain Cougar might be stalking my horses, so I retrieved all of t! he ranch weapons from their cache, loaded them and lay them squarely on the bed.  I short time earlier, maybe two months, a bobcat had been on the tin roof of the barn and had to be shot off, lest he sprang on the peafowl and chickens   That was another thing, none of the ranch chickens or peafowl seemed to be anywhere around and I didn't see the black cat that was usually hanging around the porch.   Then there was this light.  The light was a  bright red orange.  It was more than bright, it was intensely bright, it was shining in from through  the west window.  I went over to the window to look.  I was nervous and had a vague feeling of apprehension about the situation up to now, but then I saw it.  It was a saucer.  A FLYING SAUCER!  the damn thing was positioned a little over a block to the west of the house.  It shone bright red orange.  The light was just glowing right out of the steel skin or whatever metal it was.  This thing was hovering about four hundred feet in the air.  It floated silently. there were no rotors. There were no propellers.  There were no jet engines, no rocket thrusters or any visible means of how it moved.  I estimate that the craft was 300 feet in diameter.  It was fifty feet high and believe there was a dome or protrusion on top. I did not see any beings or creatures. there were no windows or portals visible. It looked exactly like the shape of two tin pie pans hooked together into classic science fiction  Flying Saucer shape.  The strong light that it emitted cast shadows from the cedar fence posts , the fence line, the sagebrush and the greasewood all around and under it.the entire desert alkalai floor was lit up bright as day under and around it .there was a large alfalfa haystack near where I first observed this ship .The haystack cast a large grotesque shadow by this things light.  Again, it made no sound, but its presence and possibly whatever emanated from it scared the hell out of the dog ,the horses and me! I was crying, sweating profusely , and ready to pee my pants all at once. what wa! s most terrifying to me was, as I looked upon it   I suddenly knew it was watching me and it was aware that   I was there. THE best description of what it was... and this is deeply ingrained upon me a living machine. It didn't just strike me as being evil IT was evil. Malevolant not friendly or here to help mankind. also I just knew this thing was capable of killing with no qualms. I just knew this and other things about it, it communicated via telepathy , and I didn't like it. I didn't like it trespassing or being there at all and the living intelligent saucer read my mind enough to know that I would fight and resist  if I could. I may have been abducted . I do not think I was but I might have been. I don't know how long I stared at it maybe  a few minutes. suddenly it floated over the house and as it did, the tin roof on the barn and bunkhouse rattled and so did all the dishes in the pantry then it shot off to the southeast end of the ranch to the pasture we call the ros! ebushes .it is a boggy wetland of marshes cattails and deed we! t and dr y sand .     many wild rows of rosebushes grow there.it is on the shoreline of the great Salt Lake located on the north end of one arm of the lake. this Craft hovered above the rosebush pasture twelve mile southeast. It moved from overhead to the rosebushes in much less than half a seconds time. The next development was two U.S. Airforce Jets approached from the Northwest.  these two jets in formation flew over the house at 1210 a,m. so low that the jetwash stirred up dust in the yard after they went by.  Probably didn't help calm the horses down any as they passed either.  They were F-105 thunderchief Fighter bombers,  nuclear capable. before these heavy bombers got much past the house,  not even within 11 miles of the saucer, it shot right straight up and winked out. It didn't fade off into space, like you could see it fade away with distance, it reached  a speed around ten thousand feet above ground level and disappeared.  The fighters continued on around the west side of th! e lower promontory peninsula and drose up in altitude curving around the point toward Salt Lake City  or Ogdens Hill Air force base,and they too were gone.;41.5073000000001;-112.0167
