It appeared to be twice the size of a star with the light fading in and out.  We watched as it slowly moved in a circular motion and went in all directions, and appeared to travel great distances in a short time.  Then a second object appeared within a minute of the first.  Both were identical in shape, movement and flying patterns.  They looked as if they were dancing about, playing with and chasing one another.  We observed both objects for approximately 12 minutes before they went straight over us to the north and then disappeared.   They returned into our vision a minute later and continued flying at alternating speeds with lights fading and brightening every few seconds.  The objects did this 4-5 times before we lost track of them completely.  We were able to view both objects for a total of about 18 minutes.;41.5073000000001;-112.0167
