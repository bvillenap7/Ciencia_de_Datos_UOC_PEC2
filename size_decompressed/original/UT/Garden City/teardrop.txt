Formations of bright orange lights over garden city, utah;2016-05-14 21:15:00;2 minutes;formations of bright orange lights over garden city, utah i was in my driveway, facing south when i saw 3 bright orange lights coming from my right, one ahead of the other 2. They all came to a stop and hovered in front of me, distance was hard to estimate, at first I thought they might be helicopters from the way they moved, but could hear no engine noise. 2 moved upand started moving away at a high rate of speed and disappeared very quickly.  The last stayed for a few seconds longer, then slowly moved upward until it also disappeared.  Soon after, 3 more came from the same direction as the first 3, one out in front, other 2 following.  All 3 stoped and hovered for a few seconds, then 2 left just like the previous did.  One remained and seemed to move slowly toward me, then stoped. It was closer than any had come, then it moved slowly upward and disappeared.  All were very bright orange and circular, maybe pear shaped and blinking.;41.9376;-111.4092
