Whitish orb changing shape hovering over Bear Lake.;2015-01-05 18:00:00;4 minutes;Whitish orb changing shape hovering over Bear Lake. The second time I seen the object was on 1-5-15 at 18:00. I was just coming up the hill to the shop and just passed the gate I noticed the same object at what looked like the same spot I had previously seen it so I stopped the truck and grabbed my phone hoping to get a picture before it took off again,  I took 4 or 5 photos then a short video, when I stepped out of the truck it took off again towards the east, faster than anything I have ever seen.;41.9376;-111.4092
Whitish orb hovering, moving erratically, then hovering again, same spot.;2015-01-19 19:00:00;10 minutes;Whitish orb hovering, moving erratically, then hovering again, same spot. The third time was on 1-19-15 around 19:00 hours. I let my dogs out and lit up a smoke and looked towards the east off my deck towards the lake and there it was at first it was just hovering sitting still then it dropped and moved forward and returned to its original position, it did this a couple times and I went back in the house for my phone and a camera and my spotting scope, got in the ruck and headed a block to the edge of the hill where I could get a better view.   By this time it had moved north east quite  ways and had gained altitude.  I took some more photos and some with my spotting scope it quickly moved off to the north end of the lake and out of sight.;41.9376;-111.4092
