((NUFORC Note:  The source of this report also has submitted each of the reports described below as separate entries.  They can be found for Garden City, UT, for the respective dates.  PD)) 1-24-15:   The first sighting I had was on Dec 31, between 22:00 and 23:00 I came out of my shop that sits on a hill above Bear Lake, turned out the lights and locked the door and turned around towards the lake and seen something hovering over the water and it seems like it was maybe a couple hundred yards away, I knew it was out of place , it was below the east shore mountain line, I didnâ€™t think to take a picture I hurried to  my truck and got in started it, all the while watching the whitish amber colored object, then it changed shape and headed off to the east really fast. The second time I seen the object was on 1-5-15 at 18:00. I was just coming up the hill to the shop and just passed the gate I noticed the same object at what looked like the same spot I had previously seen it so I stopped the truck and grabbed my phone hoping to get a picture before it took off again, I took 4 or 5 photos then a short video, when I stepped out of the truck it took off again towards the east, faster than anything I know of here on earth. The third time was on 1-19-15 around 19:00 hours. I let my dogs out and lit up a smoke and looked towards the east off my deck towards the lake and there it was at first it was just hovering sitting still then it dropped and moved forward and returned to its original position, it did this a couple times and I went back in the house for my phone and a camera and my spotting scope, got in the ruck and headed a block to the edge  of the hill where I could get a better view, by this time it had moved north east quite  ways and had gained altitude, I took some more photos and some with my spotting scope it quickly moved off to the north end of the lake and out of sight. Cont-  I have several pictures that make no sense to me, I sent you some pics in an email on 1-23-15, I tried to send a video but postmaster at hot mail undeliverable, I will try and send it again in a zip file or some other means.;41.9376;-111.4092
