Amber orb hovering steady over Bear Lake changing to white triangular shape;2014-12-31 22:30:00;2 minutes;Amber orb hovering steady over Bear Lake changing to white triangular shape The first sighting I had was on Dec 31, between 22:00 and 23:00.  I came out of my shop that sits on a hill above Bear Lake, turned out the lights and locked the door, and turned around towards the lake, and seen something hovering over the water and it seems like it was maybe a couple hundred yards away. I knew it was out of place, it was below the east shore mountain line.  I didnâ€™t think to take a picture.   I hurried to my truck and got in started it, all the while watching the whitish amber colored object, then it changed shape and headed off to the east really fast.;41.9376;-111.4092
