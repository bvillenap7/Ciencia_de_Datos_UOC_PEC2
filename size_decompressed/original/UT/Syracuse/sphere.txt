Blue Orb UFO spotted flying over northern Utah.;2013-09-11 00:45:00;6 seconds;Blue Orb UFO spotted flying over northern Utah On September 12th 2013 I was up late working on the computer and I decided to take a break and let my dog out.  Seeing a clear sky outside, I walked out with him into the front yard to check out the stars.  As I looked back down to check whether or not my dog (Aussie) was doing his business (He’s a faker sometimes), I caught a blue light to my right in the corner of my eye. I live near the shore of the northern end of the Great Salt Lake and I was facing south when I the light caught my attention.  I immediately looked to the west and  noticed a blue orb rapidly approaching from the west and heading due east.  The orb was bright blue like a ball of plasma and had a glow around it. It appeared to be pretty high but still large.  It took what I felt like 6 seconds for it to pass overhead a little to the south and cross over the rocky mountains to the east. I’ve looked into how far my viewing distance was from my vantage point and It was roughly 50 miles. The 6 second fly over time would suggest an incredible speed.  From the cirrus clouds that sparsely skiffed the sky that night, I would speculate that the orb was at 60k feet or more when It passed over and it made no sound.  The light from the orb did light up the cirrus it passed over slightly but it appeared to be much higher than their level.  I have no clue what it was and this was the first time I’ve ever spotted anything you could call a UFO.;41.0799;-112.0481
