Nine orange lights ascending into western sky over Antelope Island.;2013-01-12 00:30:00;8 minutes;Nine orange lights ascending into western sky over Antelope Island 1/12/13 at approx 1230am I was on my back porch looking up at the stars.  It was partially cloudy with several clear spots.  South west from my location a large orange light ascending straight up into the sky caught my attention.  After several seconds, it seemed to flicker out.   Just then 2 more came from the same spot as the first.  When the fourth came up, I ran upstairs to wake my husband.   I opened the blinds just as the fifth and sixth came up.  Then three more, one after another appeared, traveling the same path.  They all came from the same place, ascended straight up, then either disappeared into the clouds, or just disappeared. The objects initially looked like a rocket being launched from the ground.  They never went back down, just up.  I could not make out the shape other than maybe round or oval, they were just large, bright, very orange lights traveling at a fast and steady speed. They clearly came from the exact same place. The objects seemed to have come from the area of Antelope Island, maybe even south west of that.  I heard no noise coming from them when I was outside, and I have never seen planes or jets that were bright orange and silent.  I donâ€™t know what they were.  I only hope someone else may have seen them too.  Maybe there were more than the nine I saw?;41.0799;-112.0481
