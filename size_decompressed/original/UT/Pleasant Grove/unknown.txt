Saw what looked to be several points of light moving at differing speeds in a circle formation. ((anonymous report));2017-07-23 02:00:00;2 minutes;Finished watching a movie and remember I had not locked my shop outside.  So I went outside and glanced up at the sky and saw what looked to be several points of light moving at differing speeds in a circle formation moving slowly towards mount Timpanogas just above it.   They the disappeared over the mountain, as they went into clouds above the mountain.  The circle formation they were in was rather spread out but not even.  I have never seen anything like this before.  I was so surprised, I told some of my family members the next day.
