Witnessed blue glowing Chevron craft in the sky over Tremonton Utah.;2014-10-10 21:00:00;25 seconds;Witnessed blue glowing Chevron craft in the sky over Tremonton, Utah. My husband and I stepped on to the back patio of our townhouse while he smoked a cigarette.  We both were admiring the stars when we both witnessed a blue glowing light in the shape of a Chevron in the sky. This was not an airplane and was very high in the sky and was very, very large.  As a former member of the US  Air Force I'm very aware of what planes look like in the sky.  Also as the daughter of a Navy Seal I am very much aware of what planes look like and sound like.  It hovered in one spot for about 20 to 25 seconds above the mountains before disappearing out of sight.  It made absolutely no noise like a normal aircraft would.   I was six weeks pregnant at the time and miscarried the very next day.  It was something we had never seen before or since and have never forgot.  I had three more miscarriages after this always in the first trimester.  I have often wondered if this encounter affected my fertility somehow after having three completely normal pregnancies.  All of my miscarriages were exactly six months apart from each other which I found very strange.  It's strange to go from having all healthy pregnancies to losing one after another after this sighting.  Eventually I h! ad my tubes removed after the fourth to prevent any future miscarriages or pregnancies.  My doctor was unable to tell me why I miscarried because I was healthy and had no fertility issues. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
