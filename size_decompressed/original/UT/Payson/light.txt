I went to my front door and there was an object relatively low in the sky moving in circles and from left to right and up and down.   What was most noticeable was that it was flashing a bright white light (like LED bright) but more of a pulse.  You could see there was two lights (like headlights) and when it would face away you couldn't see the object.   Then it would face us and get super bright. We watched it for a good five minutes.   Then I tried to capture it on my cell phone video camera.  You can see it move on my phone but its just a tiny dot.   About a minute after I started filming it moved in a straight line down towards the mountain and we couldn't see it after that.   My husband said it initially started out by our house and moved northwest to the location where I saw it.   All I know is that it wasn't a plane or helicopter or anything I've seen before.  The way it moved was unlike any aircraft I know of. I still cant stop thinking about it.  It was so crazy.;40.041;-111.7316

Every single night around 2:30am till dawn while watching the stars we see what looks like a staring the sky moving very fast,  they have to be traveling at thousands of miles an hour.  And we own a powerful laser pointer and each time we shine it it will disappear and then reappear in a different spot in the sky, or they will up here to come closer and then turn on a 90 degree angle and move away out of sight very quickly.  And then it will not be long before we will see another one, that will act the same way with the laser pointer.  This happens every single night and is quite impressive.  And sometimes they just fly past very fast but certainly under intelligent control.;40.041;-111.7316
