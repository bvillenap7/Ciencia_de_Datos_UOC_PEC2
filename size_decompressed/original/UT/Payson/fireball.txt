ORANGE BALL OF FIRE.;2012-11-10 18:20:00;12 minutes;ORANGE BALL OF FIRE Orange in center Yellow second layer with Red on the third layer barely visible outer perimiter layer, looked like it was on ball of Fire with the flames etc as it headed toward us, as it passed over, it seemed to be close it would hover and come to a complete stop, without any kind of a sound and then change directions or speed up suddenly as it headed toward North (toward Spanish Fork?).  as it completely disappeared far North (the light seemed to suddenly turn off, just before it was completely out of eye sight, when we turned around or looked up it would be instantly back again just either right south of us headed toward us again, or suddenly right over our heads, until it disappeared again, and then this process repeated again three to four times...it looked quit different from the back and not as bright flatter with three spaced out circles the middle being the largest of the three.  From the back the lights flashed on and off once in awhile, but when it flashed it flashed to a red or to an orange (from the back only) the front always stayed the same looking like a ball of fire. It made no sound and the last pass was unusually close overhead.;40.041;-111.7316
