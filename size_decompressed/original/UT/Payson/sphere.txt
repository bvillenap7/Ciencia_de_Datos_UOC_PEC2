Large mirror-like sphere observed streaking across the sky south of Payson, Utah;1999-09-17 16:30:00;8 seconds;Large mirror-like sphere observed streaking across the sky south of Payson, Utah On the above date and at the approximate time I was driving south bound on Interstate 15 in the vicinity of Payson, Utah. I was observing the landscape to my left (east) when I observed at my 10 O'clock position a spherical object that I would estimate to be approximately 5 to 6 miles east of my location. The spherical object was traveling from southwest to northeast. The object appeared to be decending in an curved trajectory. I observed the bright mirror-like sphere pass in front of a cloud formation, then pass behind another cloud, and then back into view before it disappeared behind the mountain range peaks 5 to 6 miles to the east of my position. The sphere was perfectly round in shape and cast a pale greenish reflection at it's edges. As the sphere passed it appeared to have a faint vapor trail feathering off it's trailing edge/side which was a little bit more greenish in color. The sphere's primary color was an overall mirror-like silver. The speed of the sphere (as it passed) was faster than a falling object as it appeared to be propelled. I had a clear and unobstructed view of the object for approximately 7 to 8 seconds. The weather conditions were bright sun with some scattered clouds to the east of my location. At the distance I viewed the sphere it was as large as a 5 cent coin (if I held a nickel at arm's length it would have covered the sphere. This is my only unexplained sighting.;40.041;-111.7316
