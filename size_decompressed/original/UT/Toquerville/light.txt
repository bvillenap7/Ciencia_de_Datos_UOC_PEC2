I noticed am object appearing on the horizon due southeast of our home.  We live in an open area with a several large windows facing east.  The body of light was an orange glow with what appeared to be green, blue, and red flashes around or within.  The object didn't move in unison with other stars and did not move as the satellites we frequently see.  The lights were very vivid and appeared closer than any other star in proximity to the object.  After a short cloud bank covered our view for about 4 minutes, it was gone.  The rest of the night sky was still exactly as before.;37.2529;-113.2796
