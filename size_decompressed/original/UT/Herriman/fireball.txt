Orange flame light over Herriman, UT;2011-05-30 21:00:00;5 mins;Orange flame light over Herriman, UT A little after 9pm I saw an orange light in the sky as I happened to be walking past a window in my house.  We live around 5000 West and 134th South.  I saw it from the East and it was traveling North West.   It appeared to be low in the sky at about the same altitude as military helicopters that fly during the day/evening.  Unlike the the helicopters, this made no noise, had no flashing lights and had the movement of a floating balloon (non straight line, variable speeds).   The light was orange, almost like a flame, but no fire was visible.  It also produced a big halo and was fuzzy, almost out of focus looking (not a crisp direct light found on planes).   It was first traveling West kind of slowly and bopping up and down kind of like a balloon.   Then the light started traveling North and within a short amount of time, the light appeared far away disappearing in the background.  It didn't have the appearance that it was traveling fast (no streaks of light or anything). At first my wife and I thought it might be a meteor, but it didn't travel in a fast straight line.   After reading a few entries on this site, it sounds similar to story on 7/27/2010 in Salt Lake City.;40.5153;-112.0316
