Red, white, and blue flashing light on a hovering object that we observed for over 90 minutes.;2005-11-22 22:30:00;90 min;Red, white, and blue flashing light on a hovering object that we observed for over 90 minutes. It was a very clear night. The stars were very clear. I was looking eastward out of my window and saw a red/white/blue/green brightly flashing light about 45 degrees above the ridgeline of the mountains. The area around it was undisturbed. The object did not seem to move for about 30 min.  But, after careful observation with our binoculars and 90 minutes, it definitely moved southeastward.  It moved very slowly, so we could not tell it was moving at all.;40.6437;-111.259
