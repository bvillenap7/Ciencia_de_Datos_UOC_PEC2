It was a very bright white, long object. The sky was black at the time. Here in this part of the state there are relatively no mountains in the background. In fact, on any given day the desert can be seen clearly without any obstructions from trees or buildings.  We live near a very small community so there were no buildings obstructing the sighting.;39.4029;-110.809
