I noticed what looked like a bright star. Never seen a bright star at 1330 in the afternoon. I noticed it was moving from West to East. It was just a small dot of light but would get about four times brighter then fade back to a dot of light.  I pointed it out to my neighbors but no could see it. It was rather small and was moving perty fast.;41.1315;-112.0469

Me and my neighbors were outside BSing and having a smoke in my driveway. I was facing East and noticed some red and blue lights coming from over the Wasatch Mountains.  I thought it was an aircraft but all of a suddon the lights made an impossibly tight S turn and then shot back over the mountains. No major airliner nor the F-16s on the Base can do that.  I tried to get my neighbors to see it but by the time they took me seriusly it was gone.;41.1315;-112.0469

I thought it was a plane at first but the white lights I saw started doing independent maneuvers from each other so it couldn't be a plane.  It looked like they were dancing together across the sky in kind of a snake-like configuration.  I asked my boyfriend if he was seeing what I was seeing but by that time the lights had been obscured by neighboring trees.;41.1315;-112.0469
