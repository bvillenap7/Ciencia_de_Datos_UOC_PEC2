Two orange spheres hovering over Clearfield, Utah;2013-03-31 00:00:00;5 minutes;Two orange spheres hovering over Clearfield, Utah I was inside the house when my girlfriend yelled for me to come outside to the balcony.  I looked up and 2 bright orange spheres were slowly moving through the sky.  One was very close and the other a bit further away.  They were moving towards the same direction to the southwest and moving upwards into the sky.  The way they moved was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen before as they completely stopped in the distance, moved back in the opposite direction for a minute, then the first just suddenly disappeared.  No fading into the distance, just gone in a split second. Seconds later, the other one disappeared as well.;41.1315;-112.0469
