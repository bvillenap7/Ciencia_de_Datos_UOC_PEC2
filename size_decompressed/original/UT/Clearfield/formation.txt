Each group to;2000-04-20 21:35:00;3 to 5 min.;Formation of small lights flying from South to North -- first two groups of 7 followed by 3, another of 14 and last of 7. Each group took approx. 3 sec. flying at 80 to 90 degrees across the sky. Watching from a parking lot, we observed small lights in a semi-circle which we first thought were geese.  Of course, it was too dark for geese and this formation moved across the sky in about 3 seconds.  We continued on to my car and another group of 7 appeared in the sky about 15 sec. later. We stopped this time wondering if it was the same group having returned but another appeared after the same 15 second interval with 3 which invalidated that premise.  My friend commented that the skies were alive tonite as we turned back to the South and awaited another group.  Much to our surprise, a group of 14 flew over.  These were not in a perfect semi-circle formation and were more scattered. By this time we had ruled out a search light and airplanes which were flying slowly by comparison in the area.  After another group of seven which flew directly overhead, the show was over. There were not sounds whatsoever, and it was smooth sailing from one end of the sky to the next.  Very spectacular -- incredible!!! ((NUFORC Note:  We received a telephoned report from both parties who witnessed this event.

Two white objects flying north and then south below Francis Peak.;2008-09-20 16:00:00;30 seconds or so;Two white objects flying north and then south below Francis Peak. I was in the passenger seat driving south on Interstate 15 and I looked over to the west at the mountain (Francis Peak) with the radar dishes on it and saw two objects flying south below it. My guess was that they were going about 60-70 miles per hour and they seemed to be flying below the two radar dishes. They were white in color and I couldn't make out a definitive shape. They appeared to be flying in formation, very close to each other. I watched them go into the clouds but didn't see them come out. A few minutes later, as we neared Layton and Kaysville, I saw them again, but very quickly. They were in the same area, only going the opposite direction. They were going north this time, below the radar dishes. I lost track of them as we continued heading south and I could no longer see the mountain.;41.1315;-112.0469
