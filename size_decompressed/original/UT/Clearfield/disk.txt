But I wanted to report it now, because I'm compelled to. I spotted a disk looking shape craft flying high and fast. I even saw windows. Jets fly at an angle so as to approach the runway. This object was moving straight up until gone. The way I figure it. Aliens were visiting, Hill Airforce base, for some reason or another that day, I tried hard to forget, because I don't want to dream about it any more.  I lived in Utah at the time.;41.1315;-112.0469
