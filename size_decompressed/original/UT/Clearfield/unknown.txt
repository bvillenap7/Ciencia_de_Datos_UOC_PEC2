I was on my way to school and saw one flashing green light fly down the wasatch front mountains.  It was flying fast and was gone in 2 or 3 seconds.  A second one followed shortly after travelling just as quickly.  I looked over towards Antelope Island, and saw one craft hovering, same flashing, light green, maybe blue light.;41.1315;-112.0469
