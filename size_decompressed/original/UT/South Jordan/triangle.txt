At approximately 1:30 AM, I took my dogs outside to potty prior to going to bed.  It was very clear outside and it was very quite.  I usually look up at the stars everynight when I take them out.  As I looked up I seen this triangular shapped object, similar to a boomerang but with sharp corners coming over the top of me.  It was moving in a South East to North West direction.  It appeared to be just above telephone pole height.  It blocked out the stars as it passed over me.  It appeared to be approximately 150 feet accross and 50 feet wide.  The front appeared to have a 140 degree angle.  It was moving slow enough that a runner could keep up with it.  It was completely silent and it omitted a ripple type of a heat wave similar to what you would see coming off the road pavement on a hot day.  There were no lights yet the heat rippled and gave a distinct shape.  I was amazed by its presence and just watched it as it went out of sight, probably about 300 feet away it just disapeared.  I wish I could draw it for you on this site because I will never forget it's shape.  This object was not from this earth! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Triangular shaped object with orange glow moving very slowly.;2012-01-01 00:15:00;8 min;Triangular shaped object with orange glow moving very slowly. We went to wach the fireworks for the new year.  A couple minutes after the fireworks stopped my two children and I noticed a triangular shaped object with an orange spherical glow in the center. It moved very slowly and made no noise.  It was headed east and we could see it from a side view.  After a couple minutes it turned north. From behind you could just see the orange glow. My husband came and saw it for a minute. He ran to get the video camera and by the time he returned it had vanished.;40.5565615384617;-111.930161538462
