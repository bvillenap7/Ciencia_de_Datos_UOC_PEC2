Large Circular Object Appears and Disappears 'Into Thin Air';1999-06-01 01:00:00;1-2 seconds;Large Circular Object Appears and Disappears 'Into Thin Air' The week my friends and I graduated from high school, we were outside on one of our friendsâ€™ front lawn on a clear summer night at about 1:00 am in the morning. The moon was crescent that night and setting in the southwestern part of the sky. We were talking all night to one another about our future and summer plans as we decided to call it a night and return to our respective homes. As the seven of us were outside ready to leave six of us, including myself, caught a glimpse of an object in the northern sky that made all the girls in our group scream. The object seemed to appear out of nowhere and moved at an incredible speed. It appeared in the northeastern part of the sky and moved in the shape of an arc or bow toward the northwestern part of the sky and disappeared 'into thin air' very quickly. It was circular in shape and was only slightly brighter than a full moon and had the same type of brilliance, size, shape, and likeness. It did not make any sound. The object appeared to be relatively far away from us however our judgment deciding the approximate distance of the object from us could not be determined. Exactly two weeks later at approximately the same time of night, my friend and her boyfriend reported to us that they saw the same object in the same part of the sky complete the same maneuver.

Saw 18 large orange lights in night sky move forward and up until just a pinpoint white light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Comm. pilot rept.  PD));2012-05-20 22:35:00;15 minutes;Saw 18 large orange lights in night sky move forward and up until just a pinpoint white light I was taking a walk alone in a park just south of my residence. There were no other people in the park that I could collaborate my sightings. At approximately 22:35 I was facing to the northwest and sighted 6 large orange lights moving slowly towards me from the northwest. They were traveling in what seemed to be formation in two by two. I could not distinguish their shape, size or altitude except to say they first appeared to be lights 5 to 6 times the size that satellites shine in the sky.  The two closest to me looked like they changed their forward motion to moving straight up in altitude.  I analyzed their motion to be this because the lights got smaller and smaller until they were the size of a small star.  Their color also changed to a white and sometimes bluish white and then disappeared. I then noticed that the other lights were changing motion the same as the first had but not in the same sequence. At this point the elapsed time must have been 4 or 5 minutes. As I was trying to watch the complete disappearance of the first 6 sightings another 7 lights appeared from the northwest traveling in the same direction and in what seemed to be takeoff formation. These 7 followed the same path of travel as the first 6. There were then 5 more lights that appeared and disappeared the same way. The total elapsed time for all these sighting was approximately 15 minutes. I am a licensed pilot with a commercial, multiengine and instrument rating and can state without any doubt that these lights were not fixed wing or rotorcraft flights.;40.5565615384617;-111.930161538462
Circular disk with blinking lights scares two sisters!;2012-09-09 20:52:00;10 seconds;Circular disk with blinking lights scares two sisters! Me and my sister saw a huge unidentified flying object with multiple lights, we cant recollect how many. It was in the shape of a perfect circle made of six triangles, one of which was blacked out. It was around 90 ft from the ground and we could hear the wind passing by as it moved about 40 mph.  Me and my sister both ran inside after realizing what we had seen, then went back out after about four minutes shaking.;40.5565615384617;-111.930161538462
Unexplaned huge red/orange ball over Sandy, Ut traveling horizontally and suddenly dropping out of sight.;2012-10-20 22:20:00;2 minutes;Unexplaned huge red/orange ball over Sandy, UT, traveling horizontally and suddenly dropping out of sight. As my wife took our 2 dogs out side at approximately 22:20 hours to potty, she noticed a red/orange ball making no sound traveling across the valley going north approximately the same altitude a small plane would be flying 1 to 2 thousand feet.  She hurriedly came into the house to alert me.  I immediately grabbed the binoculars and went out to the deck and viewed the object which was about 11 miles away.  It was going very slow and was emitting a red and orange glow within this ball.  It appeared to be huge based on the distance from our view.  The orange glow seemed to be contained within the ball and there seemed to be some kind of a curved line on the outside going through the center of the ball separating the red from the orange.  There were no other distinct features outside of the ball that could be identified.  As I watched the ball going north on a horizontal line it suddenly stopped for approximately 5 seconds and then dropped straight down.  I fol! lowed the ball dropping until the trees obstructed my view.  The bright red/orange form did not change nor did it leave a heat trail upon its decent.  WOW!;40.5565615384617;-111.930161538462
