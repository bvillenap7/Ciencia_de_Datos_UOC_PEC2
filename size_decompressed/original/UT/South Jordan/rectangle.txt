Black object moving silently from South to North over Salt Lake City.;2016-04-06 20:45:00;2 minutes;Black object moving silently from South to North over Salt Lake City. I observed a rectangular shaped object fly from South to North (west of me, at approximately a similar west coordinate of Herriman or West Valley) with a small non-blinking light at the front.    The object itself was solid black and could barely be seen as it was dark. I only saw it because there was a slight illuminated haze behind it.  The object was silent and was either extremely large if flying as high as a plane or smaller and hovering low over the ground.  At this same time, airplanes were flying in the same direction (South to North) toward the airport slightly East of where the object was flying.  The planes are very loud and easily discernable.  I felt the object could be a military plane.  The next night I observed this same object, this time with no light at all moving in the same direction, at the same location at approximately the same time.
