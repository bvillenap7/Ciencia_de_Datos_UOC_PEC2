Red flashing lights in circular motion flying fast!;2016-02-27 00:25:00;5 minutes;Red flashing lights in circular motion flying fast! Smoking a cigarette on my balcony, and saw a very bright red flashing light in the sky.  This is usual in my area with the airport not far.  It looked a little strange with only red color flashing lights flashing very quickly and in a sort of circular motion, but I didn't think much of it once it start looking like it was heading into the flight path for the final approach to the airport.    As I was watching it it quickly started looking very strange with lights getting brighter and flashing in a pattern I've never seen before.  Then, right before my eyes, it turned right out of any of the usual flight paths planes take and started flying east very quickly.   I went inside to get my spouse so she could help me figure it out.  She was just as shocked as I was (which is funny because she doesn't really believe in UFO's) seeing a craft with flashing lights in a circular motion.  It was closer at this point and flying very quickly with no noise and it started an upward motion and quickly disappeared from our view.  We talked for a minute and we then saw a usual plane flying into the airport and that's when my spouse was convinced we saw something totally out of the ordinary.  Definite cool sight.;40.5565615384617;-111.930161538462
