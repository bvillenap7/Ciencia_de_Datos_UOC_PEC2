((anonymous report));2018-04-18 21:00:00;Continued;Twinkling flashing horizontal/lengthwise lights over Wasatch Mtn Range, North Salt Lake, UT Seen east over the Wasatch Mtn range high in the sky...could be saucer shaped or cigar. Has flashing lights with an occasional red flash...has not moved in an hour.  Star like twinkling but seems lights are flashing horizontal/lengthwise (so not like a star). Also, a misty angled long flash appeared next to it lasting only a split second. Saw flashes of pin lights surrounding it. Has only moved slightly wast from its position over the last 1 1/2 hrs. We are out on the deck every night and have not seen this one before.
