4 red lights that can not be explained!;2011-02-05 20:30:00;25 min;4 red lights that can not be explained! My home is located about 2 miles above the city up on the east bench of the Wasatch front mountains.  After picking up some dinner I was returning home with my girlfriend to my home when coming up the hill I noticed 4 distinct red lights in a unique formation not too far above the top of the mountain.  They looked like a red/orange light.  It caught my attention because I am in to astronomy and look at the night sky very often and having lived in that same home for over 17 years I have never seen any lights like this before.  As I pointed out the lights to my girlfriend I called my brother who was waiting for me at the house.  I told him to go outside and look at the lights.  As we are pulling into my drive way I noticed that the lights had dimmed and could only see one.  My brother was in the drive way when I parked in the garage and started yelling at me to get back out here.  I got back out and 1 bright red light had just become visible and it was rising ! in altitude!  As it was rising very slowly it reached a certain point in the sky and stopped and then starting to fade away in distance!   My brothers friend also witnessed this whole thing and having all of us lived in this area for at last 15 years and never have seen anything like this before!  this was truly an amazing sight to see.

A bright light appeared and shot towards the horizon at an incredible speed but went out before reaching the horizon.;2012-10-06 21:30:00;10 seconds or less;A bright light appeared and shot towards the horizon at an incredible speed but went out before reaching the horizon. Yesterday, on October 6, 2012 at about 9:30 p.m. MST, I was driving on I-215 northbound on the west loop.  While driving, I saw a bright white light appear in the sky that I thought was a plane or something.  However, the light was bigger than the other planes in the area.   Then, the light shot down towards the horizon at an incredible speed but before the light reached the horizon, the light went out.  The whole experience was about 10 seconds or less.  Maybe, it was a shooting star.;40.8446;-111.9191
Bright circular object that emitted strange lights and raised in altitude;2017-05-23 04:45:00;20 minutes;Bright circular object that emitted strange lights and raised in altitude Date: 5/23/17 time 4:40-5:00 two witnesses.   Appeared East from NSL over the mountains several kilometers away, object was circular in shape, emitting light that varied in intensity and shape.   Object began emitting light rays that varied from spiky to wavy.  After 7 minutes of doing this, object appeared to raise in altitude very quickly, and began emitting light rays again, after repeating this for approximately another 10 minutes, object disappeared suddenly without a trace or sound.  Light behavior was very strange, almost as if object was being manipulated.;40.8446;-111.9191
