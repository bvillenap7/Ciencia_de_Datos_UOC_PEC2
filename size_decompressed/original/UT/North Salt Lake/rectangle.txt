Rectangular unidentified flying object with possible surveillance vehicle nearby.;2014-10-14 05:20:00;3 minutes;Rectangular unidentified flying object with possible surveillance vehicle nearby. Around 5:20am on October 14, 2014, a black SUV with tinted windows was parked facing west in a “No parking zone” in front of my residence.  As I traveled East, I kept thinking that it looked like a surveillance vehicle but as I turned north I realized the vehicle was facing  to see a flying object at about 100 ft above the ground that seemed to be floating. The object had intermittent white lights forming a line.  The body of the object seemed to be rectangular in shape.  It was dark so the lights were the only guide to size and shape.;40.8446;-111.9191
