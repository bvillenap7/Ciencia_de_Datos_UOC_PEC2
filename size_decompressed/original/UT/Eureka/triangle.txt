It was a little past 22:00 hrs. last night.  I was outside letting my dog use the restroom before I put him into his pen.   Something caught my eye in the sky.  It seemed that it flashed that is what caught my attention but as I finally focused on it, it was black looked kinda triangular was silent and didn't move like a bird.  Was very steady not very high in the sky at all and was moving southwest.;39.9578;-112.1195
Black triangular with (larger than normal aircraft) 3 red lights 1 at each point of the craft Locally known as military operated.;2017-09-20 21:00:00;30 minutes;Black triangular with (larger than normal aircraft) 3 red lights 1 at each point of the craft Locally known as military operated Black triangular with (larger than normal aircraft) 3 red lights 1 at each point of the craft Locally known as military operated Delta craft by not formally disclosed.  They seemed to fly in a circular pattern around the area low and very slow almost hovering at times.  The apparently mobile makeshift landing and takeoff zone was located in a narrow valley between the city of Eureka and Silver City.  There were orange light balls falling from very high altitudes (resembling meteors) the Delta's would dart towards these objects and circle them in close proximity.  I observed one of the Delta's actual collide with one of the objects knowing it off course. ((NUFORC Note:  We are not convinced that this is a serious report.  PD));39.9578;-112.1195
