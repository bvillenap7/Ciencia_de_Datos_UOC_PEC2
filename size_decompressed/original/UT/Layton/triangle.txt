Noticed a off grey triangle shape object moving from south to north just above horizon.;2000-04-30 22:00:00;60 seconds;Noticed a off grey triangle shape object moving from south to north just above horizon. Noticed a off grey triangle shape object moving from south to north just above horizon.  Object had faintly illuminated corners almost as if reflecting surrounding city light. Area between corners was dark but yet a different hue than the surrounding sky.  As object passed in front of stars or mountains it blocked them out. Object was traveling approximately 4-6 miles away in a line that appeared to be over the wasatch mountains.  It was traveling fast but not at break neck speed.  It moved in a straight line and made no sound at all.  I lost sight of the object as it passed behind a small group of trees.  It did not come out the other side of the trees.  There is a small canyon that is in a line behind where we were standing and the group of trees.  I figure that it must have turned up the canyon or changed direction fast enough that we would have been looking in another area than where it actually was.;41.0853364583333;-111.958801388889
Black triangle shaped object, red and blue strobe-lit, two and-a-half miles east of HAFB, hovering at an altitude of 150-200 ft.;2000-09-28 20:00:00;5 minutes;Black triangle shaped object, red and blue strobe-lit, two and-a-half miles east of HAFB, hovering at an altitude of 150-200 ft. The object was first observed as brilliant flashing of red and blue strobe lights above a viaduct at the hill crest, two-and-a-half miles east of Hill Air Force Base. The object was visible through the windshield of my car as I approached the crest of the hill from the north on Highway 89. When I drove under the viaduct I slowed my automobile to about 20 mph, and was directly underneath the apparently hovering object. This object appeared to have a similar size to a that of a small conventional aircraft. The object seemed to have an altitude of about 150-200 feet. As I looked at the hovering, strobe-lit object from out the window of my moving vehicle, it appeared to have a solid black body in the shape of an equilateral triangle. As I pulled to the side of the road and brought my automobile around to face the object, it began to move north. Its pace was slightly faster than that of the northbound traffic below it, on Highway 89. Soon it was out of range as it continued on a northern course.;41.0853364583333;-111.958801388889
