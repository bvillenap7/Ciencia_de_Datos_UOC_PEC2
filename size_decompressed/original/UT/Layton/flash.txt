One very bright strobe ufo.;2016-08-18 22:30:00;10-20 seconds;One very bright strobe ufo At approx 2230 hours, myself and my nephew was on our porch, facing west, and all of the sudden, my nephew looked up into the sky and was freaking out.  He could barely speak, he was so excited!!   At seeing this craft which was strobing very brightly and the colors that where changing very awesome to behold!!  The colors that where seen was silver blue red and yellow and green.  Interesting to note that when we where looking at the object and talking about it, the craft then proceeded in a northern direction towards Hill AFB, which is less than five miles from my house, and disappeared very quickly.  No sound at all.   Where this craft was in the sky would have been close to civilian air traffic corridor for flights in bound to SLC, Utah.  The overall sighting didn't last long about 20 seconds.  It was like it was saying hello, here I am, and zip...gone.  Most amazing sight I have ever seen!!;41.0853364583333;-111.958801388889
