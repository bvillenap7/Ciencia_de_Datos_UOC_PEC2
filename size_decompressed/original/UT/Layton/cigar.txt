2 massive cloaked craft over Layton, Utah.;2016-04-11 22:00:00;~20 seconds;2 massive cloaked craft over Layton, Utah. Myself and a friend were star gazing in my back yard, when an object crossed the sky.  There was no light coming from the object but light from the moon refracted around it.  The object appeared massive as there was a commercial Jet that flew below it. It was closely followed by a second identical craft. My friend noticed the craft first, and at her excitement, I Looked to where she was pointing in the sky and saw both Craft as well.  There was no sound emitted from the craft. The craft traveled northwest across the sky.;41.0853364583333;-111.958801388889
