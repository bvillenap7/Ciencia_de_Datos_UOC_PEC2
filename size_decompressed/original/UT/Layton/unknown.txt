Weird and Strange lights;2002-06-30 23:00:00;variable;Weird and Strange lights I recently submitted a report this morning for another incident in NJ, but when I was stationed at Hill AFB UT.  One of the shifts that I worked was 5a-5p and during the 2001-2003 time period as if you were to face north at the Wasatch mountains every night there were lights that appeared on the mountain at the top.  I am not aware of any roads in this area but there is a ski resort on the other side of this mountain but about 30-40 minutes from where thee lights were seen.  There would be lights anywhere from 1-7 and thelights would be present for several minutes turn off, come back on. Sometimes they would stay on for 30 minutes or so.  The distance between the base and this location is about 15 miles and these lights are extremely bright.  I went onto google maps and zoomed into the area where these lights came from, a ridge line, there aren't any roads. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It was very dark out, an overcast of thin clouds with about a 1500 foot ceiling based on the commerical airliners landing at Salt Lake International airport at the south end of the Great Salt Lake.  As I took out my car keys from my jacket, I happened to look up to the north end of the valley and saw several aircraft on final descent to the airport. As I was watching them for a moment, I also noticed what appeared to be three lights (white, red, and another white) horizontal to each other skipping between the landing aircaft.  The unidentified lights traveled from the north end of the valley to what appeared to the the airport in about 10 seconds or less and I estimate the distance to be about 30 miles or so in that 10 seconds.  It did not fly in an straight line, but seemed to hop skip a little above and below as it traveled horizontally.  I think the pilots making their approach may have seen this event as it seemed to be in their line-of-sight.;41.0853364583333;-111.958801388889
15+ Lights seen on the Wasatch mountain range;2012-01-01 00:15:00;20 Minutes;15+ Lights seen on the Wasatch mountain range Was driving home from a friends house on new years when I noticed 3 orange/red lights floating up and down on the side of the mountain.  I called a friend to ask him if he could see them too and another 15-20 lights started appearing and rising up, all throughout the range, and over the mountains dissipating on the other side.  He saw them and realized as I did that they were reappearing and sinking, then continuing to rise up again until they completely disappeared around 12:38 AM;41.0853364583333;-111.958801388889
Lighted UFO zig-zagged across the sky.;2018-08-08 02:36:00;3 minutes;Lighted UFO zig-zagged across the sky. A flashing lighted ship with red, greens, whites and yellows appeared in the Northwest sky and moved in a zigzagged line from West to East over the Ogden, Utah, area, disappearing over Snowbasin Ski Resort.  It was moving faster than our local fighter planes, it moved up, down, closer and further as it went across the sky, and there was no sound accompanying it.;41.0853364583333;-111.958801388889
