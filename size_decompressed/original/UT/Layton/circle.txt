Flashing/darting light in the sky over an hour;2015-12-02 22:00:00;90 minutes;Flashing/ Darting light in the sky over an hour Last night 12/3/2015, around 10:45 ish, my husband and I were going to bed.  we noticed a light, brighter than a star.  It was far away and it appeared to be east, below the little dipper.  It was flashing and sputtering around and at times would dart across the sky and then back again.  Sometimes the light would get brighter then dim again and seemed to go a slight green color and an orange color.  At one point it actually disappeared and then came back.  I called my brother who lived south of me to see if he could see it as well.  He said he could but it was further South of him.  WE didnâ€™t know where our binoculars were so I got my phone out to see if I could zoom in on it to see if I could see it better.   With the naked eye, through my phone, it appeared to be circular (like 6 small circles connected with each circle lit up). The phone only captured the light in the distance darting around.  We watched it for about an hour and I decided to go bed as it late.;41.0853364583333;-111.958801388889
Bright  white circle with a darker center.;2017-11-14 13:00:00;30 minutes;Bright  white circle with a darker center Report of my encounter I was out on the the golf waiting  to tee off on the 7th tee block, as I was waiting to tee off I looked up and  I saw this bright white object it looked like it had a dark spot in the center. At first I tried to match it with any aircraft  I might know but the way it wasn't moving  the shape and the color it didn't click in my memory, I tee'd off and walked to where my ball landed, again I had to wait to take my stroke so I looked up it was still there, there was a wispy cloud it looked close to the object and the cloud was dissipating but the object remained the the same. the way the sun was hitting the object it looked like it was venting something  off the north edge, I took another  shot and I walked to where the ball landed, I looked up it was still in the same position I chipped up on the green after I seen where the ball landed I looked up there was no trace of it, it as just  gone it didn't wake a sound. I live by an Air Force Base, I retired from the base after 38 years, as a civilian I spent  28 years  in the Air Force Reserve, and the Air National Guard I retired as an E-8 in Supply and Logistics, I have been around Helicopters, all different types fighter air craft foreign and domestic, and transport air craft, I have been up close and personnel with the SR-71.
