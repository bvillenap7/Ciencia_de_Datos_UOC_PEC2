Tiny pinpoints seen moments apart, moving North at a steady, unwavering rate.;2003-06-28 23:30:00;1 minute;Tiny pinpoints seen moments apart, moving North at a steady, unwavering rate. It was around eleven at night and I was outside with a pair of binoculars, taking advantage of the good weather by stargazing. It was a warm night, there weren't any clouds in sight, and the light pollution was low. I was looking for Polaris, the North Star, by following the stars Dubhe and Merak of Ursa Major. I was having difficulty finding it, and I blamed this on a stray cloud, even though it was a clear night. Suddenly, something caught my right eye and I realized that a small pinpoint of light was moving across the constellation Bootes toward the area I had been searching earlier, to the North. At first, I thought it was a shooting star, but I continued to watch it and it did not fade or disappear. I knew it was not an airplane, either, as it was far too high in the atmosphere. It was about the size of a small star, and had a reddish glint to it. As I watched, it made its way across the sky, then disappeared from my view once it got too low to the horizon. I shrugged this off, and continued to stargaze. But it hit me as a real shock when I realized that there was another one, following the same Northern path in the sky. I watched this one, and then a third, for it appeared shortly after the second. They were all tiny pinpoints of light that required my binoculars for a clear view, and all three followed the Northern path, disappearing once they came too close to the horizon.

6 bright orange lights to the East over the Wasatch Mountain Range;2011-11-26 21:00:00;15 minutes;6 bright orange lights to the East over the Wasatch Mountain Range Approximately 9 pm, saw 6 bright orange lights rising to the East over the Wasatch mountain range.    At first, there were 5 lights were rising in a column which then separated, spreading out in different directions.  All but one blinked out after only a few minutes, and the last one remained stationary for another minute or so.  As that one blinked out, we noticed another rising below it.  This final light was the brightest, and we were able to watch it for nearly 5 minutes as it rose upward then sat stationary for about 30 seconds.  It flashed red and blinked out, also.  We noticed that the object was still faintly visible.  It appeared white and travelled to the north for several minutes, where we lost track of it. We live just a few miles South of Hill Air Force Base, and we are accustomed to seeing objects in the sky.  These were not jets, helicopters, or any other aircraft that we are used to seeing.  There was no sound.   I initially thought perhaps they were flares, but the objects moved upward, hovered, and changed direction.  Also, the lights were orange and round/symmetrical.  The odd way the last light flashed red before blinking out was unlike anything I have seen before.  We watched the news for some kind of report, but there was nothing.  Surely, there are others who saw this!;41.0853364583333;-111.958801388889
5 orange red lights moving over Layton, Utah;2012-02-06 19:45:00;10 minutes;5 orange red lights moving over Layton, Utah Driving east on Oak Hills Drive around 19:30 on Feb. 6, 2012 I saw 5 lights against the mountains to the east.  At first I thought it might be 5 hikers spread out in a long line on the ridge south of Adams Canyon.  But the lights were too bright to have been flashlights at the apparent distance, so I wondered if they could be 5 camp fires.  Then I noticed the lights were moving slowly.  When the top one went above the top of the mountains, I realized they were flying.  The group was moving west or slightly south west.  It was dark, the sun having set around 6:30 or so. The lights were an orange red color.  I figured it must be 5 people in ultra lights or helicopters.  But the lights were not blinking they were steady. I live near the top, east end, of Oak Hills Drive.  When I got home, I stood outside to watch them.  I called my wife out to see them.    There was no sound coming from them.  They stayed somewhat together as a group for a while, but started to drift apart.  Each one either moved at a moderate speed, or appeared to hover for a while.  Several individuals went towards the west, and then circled to the north and back east into view.  Then 2 headed out of view towards the south, south west.  Then 2 more moved out of view in that same direction. The remaining one came back from the west, and appeared to be coming east towards me, but it gradually grew dimmer and dimmer until it disappeared overhead.  It appeared to have moved up in altitude until no longer visible.;41.0853364583333;-111.958801388889
1-5 orange stationary lights observed over Layton, Utah;2015-03-08 21:45:00;5-10 minutes;1-5 orange stationary lights observed over Layton, Utah At 9:45PM, on March 8, 2015, I observed one orange light in the sky over East Layton, Utah, for a period of 5-10 minutes.  Weather conditions were clear and calm, few if any clouds – stars clearly visible over most of sky.   From my vantage it appeared to hover in area approximately 2000 feet above the FAA RADAR station atop Francis Peak.  The light was brighter than any star in the clear night, pure orange in color, and was not dimming or growing in intensity.  The “orange object” did not exhibit any green/red/white blinking aircraft navigation lighting.  My first thought was that it was an aerial flare, but it was stationary, and did not shimmer or produce visible smoke. My 24-year-old son reported seeing 5 such lights as he drove home 10 minutes earlier.  And independently, my daughter-in-law was outside that same night on a smoke break at work and also saw 5 orange lights above Layton, Utah. My son listens to Weber and Davis County police dispatch while he drives about.  He says that there was some chatter on both dispatch channels about these orange lights, but that they moved the discussion off to a non-monitored channel. I am 53 year old father and grandfather, my occupation is in the High-Tech field.;41.0853364583333;-111.958801388889

The light did a quick turn around going in a southeastern direction until it disappeared behind the clouds.  Then it reappeared going in the northwestern direction again and did another turn around to disappear behind the clouds.  It lasted about 10 to 15 seconds.  The sky was light but it had not been light long.  There didn't seem to be any noise associated with it.  The light remained at the same intensity.  The speed seemed to change as it moved.  The angles of its movement were not very smooth.;41.0853364583333;-111.958801388889
