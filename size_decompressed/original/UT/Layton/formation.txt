Several lights making formations seen north of Layton, UT;2014-03-07 18:52:00;30+ minutes;Several lights making formations seen north of Layton, UT Entered the city of Layton close to 7pm when I had noticed a formation of lights while entering the city from the Antelope Drive exit.  At first I thought it might have been just a bunch of helicopters or something of that sort, until I realized the lights were not moving nor flashing. As I drove through town towards the Layton Hills mall, I noticed that the lights I had seen moments before were now shaped differently than before. They went from a 55 degree angle, to 40 degree angle, to a 70 degree angle within moments.  When at 70 degrees it was curved at the top (completely mind blowing)   As I left the city it was almost as if all the lights completely scattered and spread out.  There were 6 to 7 of them with the exception of one disappearing and reappearing in different spots.;41.0853364583333;-111.958801388889
