Daytime orb being followed by helicopters.;2010-06-04 11:56:00;1 minute;Daytime orb being followed by helicopters. On 06/04/2010, I was at my visiting my mother at her home in Price, Utah.  She was in the kitchen making lunch, and all of a sudden, I had a very strong premonition to go outside with my camera.   I picked up my camera off the couch and went out into the front yard and in a very short amount of time, notice a white orb like object moving across the sky at a very high rate of speed.  I quickly put my camera up towards it and took a quick picture.  I was worried that I might have missed it, but got lucky and captured it.  This object was moving south and had two military helicopters following it, which seemed to be having problem trying to keep up with it.   The orb like object moved very fast and I had only enough time to take one quick picture of it.;39.6087;-110.7995
Mars like object traverses night sky.;2013-12-29 18:00:00;5 minutes;Mars like object traverses night sky A red orb that I first mistook for Mars appeared directly over head.  it seemed to be mars, but I knew mars was not in that part of the sky.  I watched it move very slowly and I actually had to find a stationary object in the foreground to verify its movement and direction.  I assumed it to be a very bright satellite or even the ISS, however it continued on an approximate magnetic heading of 160 or south by southeast.  it traversed the entire sky until it was seemingly gone over the horizon.  no detectible change in speed or heading was observed.
