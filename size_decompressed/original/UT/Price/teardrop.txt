Six hovering lights above price, utah.;2006-11-22 01:00:00;30 min;Six hovering lights above price, utah. My husband and I were out stargazing together after the children were tucked into bed.  Watching the sky intently we noticed a shooting star.  Then another one.  Then another one.  Then another one.  Then another one.  Finally our glance darted to the last shooting star.  Wow. We thought to ourselves.  There most certainly are a lot of shooting stars out tonight.  The stars however didn't fade into the distance.  They were hovering.  Hovering right before our eyes.  They looked like little sad teardrops that the moon had just recently cried.  Like he had just got dumped by his girlfriend venus.  We suddenly panicked and ran around screaming.  My husband ran into our barn wall, broke his femur, and peed his pants.  When I looked back into the sky they all darted away, even quicker than they had come.;39.6087;-110.7995
