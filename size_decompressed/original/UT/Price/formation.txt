Formation of 8 flashing orange lights moving slowly across the southwestern sky, Carbon County,  Price, Utah.;2018-12-09 21:30:00;8 minutes;Formation of 8 flashing orange lights moving slowly across the southwestern sky, Carbon County, Price, Utah. Approximately 9:30 pm on 12/9/18 my daughter said come outside quickly, my wife and I ran outside and looked up in the southwestern sky to see a formation of 8 bright flashing lights, orange in color in a flat formation traveling very slowly across the sky.  Thought maybe it was a squadron of aircraft, but it made no sound.   Also the last light in formation suddenly turned a very bright white then seemed to disappear.  I have never seen anything like this in my 54 years.  Again, I believe that this wasn't any type of aircraft.  My daughter and wife tried to film it on their cell phone, and I with my slr, but didn't get any good images.   Several other people were standing outside their vehicles trying to video the event also.  Again this occurred over Price, Utah, southwest sky.   Trying to find some news reports regarding this event.;39.6087;-110.7995
