4 white supersonic crafts chasing what aeemed to be a giant triangular craft;2014-09-24 21:30:00;10 minutes;4 white supersonic crafts chasing what aeemed to be a giant triangular craft first i seen a craft what i thought to be a airplane but as it got closer i seen that it was much much larger than that it had a pulsating white light at the front and red green and blue light down both wings ill call them. it took about 2 min to cross the sky moving at a pace slower than a plane. after the craft dissa peared about 8 minutes after tthat i noticed 4 crafts moving at outrageous speeds that had white pulsating lights and the bottom of the craft was lit up bright red they were traveling about a football field between each other in the same trajectory as the first craft i seen except these ones looked much much smaller and moving at what i would describe as super sonic speeds.... all the while no sounds whatsoever during the whole 10 minutes;38.7416;-112.0731
