bright blue light that turned night into day;2003-01-10 10:00:00;5 min;bright blue light that turned night into day I walked outside with four friends to my car and all of a sudden we heard a sound and saw a blue fire ball going from one side of the horizon to the other as it came closer and over us the night turned to a blue day...  then as it passed the bright light went with it... literally the night was day with a blue hue.... weirdest thing i have ever seen. I'm from California and the locals that i was with seemed un bothered by the event and said to me while i freaked out stuff happens out here all the time... also the claimed to wake up in the middle of the night unable to move because they believed skin walkers Indians stood over them and and cast spells and what not... whole town believed in them if you say skin walker in a crowd.... everyone stops talking and looks at you like shut up we don't want em coming here.... strange people... strange beliefs ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I saw a fireball in the sky moving too slow to be a meteor;2003-08-15 23:30:00;5 seconds;I saw a fireball in the sky moving too slow to be a meteor While driving home, a fire ball came into my line of vision over the top of my truck. It was traveling east to west, and dissappeared over the mountain. My first impression was a plane on fire, but this object had a distinct ball shape. It was traveling too slow for a meteor. There were Flames visible around the object. Just after the object dissappeared over the mountain, I saw a flash of light, but the local airport beacon light was on at the time so the reflection of that may have been what I saw.
