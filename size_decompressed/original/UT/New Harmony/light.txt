Very bright light seen hovering over mountains.;2013-02-06 22:45:00;Unknown;Very bright light seen hovering over mountains. Myself and 3 others were traveling Northbound on I-15 just south of New Harmony, UT. We came over the crest of a hill (what is referred to as the Black Ridge by locals), and immediately saw a very bright light which appeared to be hovering in place over the  mountains East of New Harmony.   We watched it for about 5 minutes as we passed through the area, and it never moved.  There were no strobes or blinking lights that we could see either, it stayed bright and clear until we were no longer able to see it as it was too far behind us.;37.455;-113.268
We saw several, 20 plus, bright white lights materialize from the sky and move in a straight line headed north. ((Starlink satellites));2020-09-14 05:40:00;1-2 minutes;We saw several, 20 plus, bright white lights materialize from the sky and move in a straight line headed north. We were walking in the early morning about 5:40 am while it was still dark. We saw two bright white lights high in the sky heading north following each other. Then another light appeared, and then more lights appeared one after the other. We looked to see where they may be coming from, and realized the lights materialized from the north side of the Milky Way. All bright white lights appeared to be the same size and brightness.  After counting about 14 lights materialize from the west-northwest moving in a straight line following each other headed north we lost count because we could not figure out what we were seeing. The lights stayed in a straight line and moved farther away until we could not see them any longer. There was no sound. We were on a rural road, there are some houses spaced apart and it was dark around us. The sky was clear.;37.455;-113.268
