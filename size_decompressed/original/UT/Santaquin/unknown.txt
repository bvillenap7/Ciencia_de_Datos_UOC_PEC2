They looked like a satellite one would see on clear stary night, but a bit brighter. They would probably be mistaken for satellites, except they moved in exact formation. We spotted them to the North and they moved South, SouthEast. They moved a bit faster than a satellite would. We saw them for about 20 seconds.  Some personal observations:  They certainly could have been satellites, but I know of no satellites that fly in formation (again, both my wife and I notice specifically that they moved together without the slightest separation, at least that can be seen with the nake eye.)  Though its hard to explain, you could see that the objects were a great distance just by the look of the lights. The only thing I wish I would have taken note of at the time was whether any stars were visible inbetween the lights, thus indicating some sort of solid object.  More than anything, I would like to know if there is a reasonable explanation. If there is someone who knows what this might be, or if this a common occurance. Of course the other interesting thing was that it was on the fourth of July. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the U. S. Navy NOSS satellites, which orbit in formation?  PD));39.9705;-111.8129
