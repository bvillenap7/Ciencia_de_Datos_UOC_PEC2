Stadium looking lights in sky.;2018-11-06 17:36:00;3 minutes;Stadium looking lights in sky Was driving south on I-15 towards Santaquin and noticed what I could describe as stadium lighting in the sky.  Bright LED lighting.  I'd guess 6 individual sources of light.  Couldn't see a body or anything with it, just the lights.  The brightness of the lights is what caught my attention and the size.  I initially thought wow, those are the brightest and most lights I've ever seen on an Aircraft.  But then I noticed it wasn't moving.  It was just still in the sky.  So after watching for a few minutes, I decided to grab my phone and attempt to record it.  As I did so, it was gone.;39.9705;-111.8129
