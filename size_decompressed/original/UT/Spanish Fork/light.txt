Strange changing lights in mountains and moving lights in the sky over Spanish Fork, Utah.;2013-06-11 23:00:00;10 minutes;Strange changing lights in mountains and moving lights in the sky over Spanish Fork, Utah. Iâ€™m a security guard and we are taught and trained to be vigilant while on duty.  I have had several sightings of lights around my truck gate I work at during night shift.  Even as I stopped typing this report to check a truck in, I saw another light.  The sightings are usually during dusk to midnight and usually happen every night.  They are usually seen near the top of the mountain that over looks highway 6 and the valley, and this mountain is located just north of our truck gate. When I came in to relieve the guard before me, he was telling me about these lights he has seen, and right when he did, outside on the mountain, a light started shining right where he says he usually sees it.  He left and I continued to watch this light as it turned on and off, faded from red to blue, dimmed and got brighter then occasionally shut off and turn back on and go through these phases randomly.  The light did not more or change positions. Later as I was watching the other side of the night sky and I looked up and saw a bright white light, silently and slowly move across the sky.  I was looking up at about a 70 to 80 degree angle from ground to sky.  All of a sudden, it dimmed and dimmed, then disappeared. I think it would worth investigating these mysterious lights in the Utah mountains.;40.1027;-111.6449
Three clustered bright red lights slowly descended and disappeared.;2013-11-13 20:00:00;30 seconds;Three clustered bright red lights slowly descended and disappeared. My husband and I were driving south about to enter into Spanish Fork City.  Approximately to the southeast we observed 3 bright red lights clustered closely together about 100 feet in the air.  The light moved slowly straight downward for approximately 30 seconds, not reaching the ground, and then just disappeared.;40.1027;-111.6449
