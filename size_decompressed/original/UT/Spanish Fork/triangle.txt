I was coming home from work, I looked up and saw a dark object. At first I thought it was a black kite, but as I continued to look at it I could see two or three revolving objects that revolved above it and realized that it was some kind of machine. I was driving south and the object was to my right (west) about 150 feet in the air, hovering silently.  I hurried home and told my family, my wife and 2 of our children witnessed it, by this time the object had moved further away(south west), we took turns looking through binoculars. My wife thought it looked like colored balloons revolving around the top of the object. We called the police department and no one else had seen it at that time.  It was a triangular shape at the bottom, maybe about 20 to 25 feet in diameter, but it's shape almost seemed to fluxuate, with rotating objects above it. It was not floating in the air current, it was definately intelligently controlled. After about 10 minutes it darted off north west into a cloud and with in 2 minutes a jet came out of the cloud close to where it had been.;40.1027;-111.6449
