Curiously suspended lights in Box Elder County, UT;2010-09-06 20:15:00;3-5 minutes;Curiously suspended lights in Box Elder County, UT To whom it may concern:   I called in to the KSL TV station at about 8:50 pm and spoke with a gentleman who gave me the station's email address to report something unusual in the sky in Box Elder County, UT at around 8:15 pm MT tonight,09/06/10  I called in to inquire if anyone else had reported seeing what I saw. I have been trying to find out how to inquire what would have been in that airspace at that time of night that matched the description of what I saw, which is two bright lights suspended in midair over Willard Bay, just west of I-15, past the Flying J gas station.  The lights were suspended only a few hundred feet off the ground.  The suspended lights did not match the physics of any known aircraft that I am aware of.  In other words, they were not moving in any one direction and they did not make any sound. I passed my cell phone to my wife and asked her to take video, using my Blackberry's video camera, of what we were seeing.  We were only able to obtain about 30 seconds worth of video footage.   As we passed them, I did see some structure to the lights, but I could not see much, as I was driving at about 70 miles per hour on the freeway.  Upon passing them, my wife and I looked for them in our rear-view mirro! r to continue watching them, and at that point, we were both unable to see them again. I am not seeking anything, other than a rationale explanation of what the lights could have been.  Sincerely,  Curious in Box Elder County, UT;41.3991;-112.0264
