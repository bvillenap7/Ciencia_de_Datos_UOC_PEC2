Time:  Sunday Evening, 10-23-05, about 11:00 PM  Place: Somewhere along Hwy. 30, Northern Utah, west of Hwy. 84 around Park Valley  Event: UFO Sighting   My two sons, 24 & 30 yrs. old, one of their friends (asleep at the time) and I were traveling back home to California from Preston, Idaho.  I was driving at the time along a very dark roadway (clear skies with a waning partial moon) looking for the correct turn toward Wells, Nevada, when the 3 of us that were awake saw an object above the truck. I was wide-awake, for we mandated that a ‘co-pilot’ always stay awake to keep the driver alert and it was still the early part of the trip.  ((name #1 deleted)) was the co-pilot while ((name #3 deleted)) and sleeping ((name #2 deleted)  were in the back seat.  ((name #3 deleted)) was helping us navigate correctly (extremely minimal highway signage in that part of the country).  ((name #3 deleted)) could also see the object while sitting in the back seat of the 4-door pick-up truck.   The truck we were in is a 2005 Chevy with a lift-kit, thus the headlights (on high beam at the time) shine higher than a normal truck and are very, very bright covering a good distance and a wide, high area.  I don’t believe that we would have seen the object if the headlights operated as manufactured.  The surrounding countryside was devoid of anything except relatively flat land with low brush and the roadway.  All three of us saw the unidentifiable object in the lower sky, traversing relatively fast from left to right.  I’m surmising South to North or SE’ly to NW’ly.  It was sometime between 10 PM and midnight.  My rendition of the sighting: I recall the object traversed a visible distance of maybe 1000 feet and was seen for about 4- 5 seconds.  It appeared to be about 300-500 feet in front of us (about 1/2 the distance of the traverse or less) and at 200-300 feet in altitude (about 3 times the visible length).  For some reason at the time it reminded me of a ‘flying boxcar with windows’, I don’t know why but that’s what I sensed it looked like.  The definitely-visible portion of the object was roughly rectangular in shape and hazy around the edges (long-ways parallel with the ground) with several (4 - 6) dimly lit ‘windows’ along that length.  The ‘windows’ seemed more square-like in shape as I recall, rather than round-like.  At each end of the object was a roughly-visible indistinct area that was darker-than-the-sky and about 1/2 the definitely-visible length, or more.    A distinct outline of the entire object wasn’t evident and it seemed there was no distinct bottom.  Again, as previously stated it appeared to look like a flying boxcar with windows or to a lot lesser degree a passenger train car, while sensing at the time the feeling that a massive, heavy object was traveling in the wrong place, the sky.  The light intensity reflecting off the object was similar to watching a car maybe 20-30 feet away drive through the beam of a fixed flashlight held horizontal.  The visual clarity was slightly dull with no sort of glowing or trailing evident.  I definitely recall the object was absolutely silent and colorless. I believe that I can judge distances fairly well because I like to hunt upland game & waterfowl and am also a licensed land surveyor.;41.8551;-113.3478
