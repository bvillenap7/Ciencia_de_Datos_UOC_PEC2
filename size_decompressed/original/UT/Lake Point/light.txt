Lights near  Lake Point/Grantsville, UT;2005-10-11 16:36:00;about 12 mins;Lights near  Lake Point/Grantsville, UT I was traveling Westbound on I-80 approx Mile Marker 98, looking up into the sky and I saw something that I was thinking was an aircraft near Dugway, but this was odd.  I grew up on military bases and this seemed odd.   What I saw was a bright lite going just a little into the clouds, but it seemed unusally bright for reflection.  I watched and it made several quick changes in alittude and course corrections-way to maunverable for military or civilian aircraft that I am familar with.  It moved in a WSW direction and took off at a great speed and then noticed a second one..both very bright-white.   The first one speed off toward the mountains just to the west and north of Grantsville, Ut.  The other I lost sight of for a minute as it went just over the lip of the mountain then it was back...very bright against the mountain then it changed to a black color.  As I got closer (about MM 87), I watched it, it looked like it had a shape-like a upside down pie plate (I hate saying that-everyone sees that) but black in colour.  I watched it moved south then suddenly gain altitide then drop.  I lost sight of it as I continued west.   I am a Professional Truck Driver.;40.5452;-112.2973
