We live in a very remote area in the Uinta Mountains.  A bright white light filled our bedroom waking my husband approximately 10 seconds before it woke me.  The light got brighter and bigger before shrinking to one point and disappearing.  The power went out to our entire canyon for 8 hours. 30 minutes after the light disappeared two military type jets flew low through our canyon traveling West to East.  We were both too nervous to be able to go back to sleep.;40.7243;-111.2456
