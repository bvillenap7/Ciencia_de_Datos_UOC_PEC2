I was out taking photos of some property in Oakley, UT and I noticed a disk shaped saucer in one of the photos that was taken around 15:30 on 4/27/2004. It was kind of blured like it was moving at a very fast speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Source forwards photo, which shows blurry object in upper left hand corner of photo.  Shape of the object is not inconsistent with a rooster pheasant, or perhaps a chukar partridge,  in flight, we believe.  We are unsure what the object is.  PD));40.7243;-111.2456
