Crescent shaped object approx size of a van moving west to east 60 feet in the air approx 30 mph.;2008-08-10 22:30:00;30 seconds;Crescent shaped object approx size of a van moving west to east 60 feet in the air approx 30 mph. I was  out running at about 10:30 pm when I noticed what appeared like a white flock of birds to the west of me, as I watched it come closer. I realized that it was not birds but a uniform shape. By this time I had stopped running and was standing still when that object passed over head at a height of approximately 60 to 70 feet it moved west to east at a reasonable speed(I would estimate it at a speed of  15 to 30 mph)  and it was completely silent. It was crescent shaped and what I thought was a flock of birds was actually a reflection of ground lights on the object. After it passed to the east I lost sight of it.;40.6566;-111.8907
