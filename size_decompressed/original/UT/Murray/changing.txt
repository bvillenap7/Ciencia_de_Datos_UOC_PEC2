The four of us were sitting outside on my front porch talking, we had been out there for two hours before we all saw something in the sky.   We all went silent because all four of us were trying to figure out if we were seeing things but the object was flying from north to south, when we saw the ufo it appeared to be in the sky above about 4800 south and it flew south and disappeared at about 5900 south.   When we first saw the ufo it was some what of an oval shape and had alot of very small very dim white lights (at least 50 or more).  Then, as it was flying across the sky, dead silent,  Right before it disappeared the lights multiplied to probably a few hundred and was about the size of two cars put together and each light was moving and the shape changed to a circle like shape that looked like it was pulsing.  I have never seen anything like this and I don't have any idea what it could have been and all four of us saw itâ€¦;40.6566;-111.8907
