3 alligned blinking white lights moving in same direction;2012-05-20 02:45:00;1min;3 alligned blinking white lights moving in same direction Clear cool night sky, not a cloud in sight.  Looking towards the north  sky, i a bright white flash  (a bit brighter than a airplane light also a tiny bit bigger as well.)  I saw one light blink, then behind flash of light then a second light flashed. Then the first light flashed again but this time it flashed more towards the east then again the second flash of white light behind the first light.  Then a very very dimItseemed likedim flash of light between the other two but a little bit closer to the 1st flashing light.  It was as if this was one big craft moving very slowly towards the south east.  There was no sound no other lights nothing else.   As soon as i stood up to really examin this in the sky, it simply stopped.  I saw the lughts flash about 4 times each and the dim light flash twice all in the span 2 min.

Bright green light lit up the sky.;2012-12-09 02:45:00;3 seconds;Bright green light lit up the sky Me and my friend were driving, and to the side of the freeway we saw a huge greenlight that lit up the sky. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS) No way it was a meteor. It was emmiting from the ground. I thought maybe a generator but we drove around where it was from and saw nothing. ((END ADDENDUM));40.6566;-111.8907

It began to moving down and gradually to the right.  After about 20 seconds it dims. Then the lights goes off, you see nothing, then comes back on at the dim level twice before vanishing.  Another one came about 30 seconds later doing roughly the same pattern. About 10 minutes later another appears.  This time the light moves up and down gradually moving to the right, same light patterns.  A fourth and finally a fifth light appears.  All moving up and down, with the last 2 veering further to the right, near where the first two vanished.  It wasn't long before several obvious airplanes flew across the sky in the same vicinity.  And since I have heard regular helicopters in the sky, still until now at 23:30. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.6566;-111.8907

The color changed to white triangle lights and went left to right again across a small area of sky.  Then one side light was red, other white and again went left to right in a sideways straight line Ina small area over Murray.   At one point the side by side, triangle shaped lights separated, changed from red to white and moved side to side like nothing I've ever seen, and I have always been a late night stargazer!
