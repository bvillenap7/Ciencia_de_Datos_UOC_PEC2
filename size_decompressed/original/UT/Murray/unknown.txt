True account of abduction.;1981-08-11 18:49:00;1 hour;True account of abduction. I remember a beam of light that took me out of my bed. I was a full grown man at the time. I had a wife named ((name deleted)) and 2 kids, ((name deleted)) and ((name deleted)). This is all I know. I went up into a space craft. Two beings greeted me with open arms. They showed me secrets of the world such as cold fusion, splitting the atom, and the advancement of computers. They were not threatening in any way and actually tried to comfort me. They put peaceful thoughts in my head. They also showed me what would happen if we did not stop nuclear weapons. I was feeling very sad at that time. I then blacked out or something. Only to find myself as a new born baby. I can remember being born. I know it sounds crazy but it is very true. I just recently explained my birth to my mother who was dumfounded and speechless. I have always had the feeling that I am supposed to find my original self and I have been searching ever since. I have since been contacted by the beings 3 times since my birth. They have contacted me twice in dreams and once in the night as I was driving down a deserted highway. Everytime they just show me the horrors of nuclear war. The horrors are trememndous. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not post all reports of alleged abduction/interaction, but we have elected to do so in this case.  The source seems serious-minded to us in his assertions, but that is solely a subjective evaluation on our part.  PD));40.6566;-111.8907
