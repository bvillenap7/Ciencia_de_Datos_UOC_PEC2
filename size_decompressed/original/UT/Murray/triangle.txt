Its a  eye opening thing when you see a craft like that when it makes no noise has no lights,with no exhaust,and is triangle shape,blk, like no other thing I have ever seen in the sky before.One thing we would like to say we've since moved from Murray Ut, and now live approx 12 miles from Murray in West Jordan, Utah ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
