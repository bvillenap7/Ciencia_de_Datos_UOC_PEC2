I saw a white, pill shaped object at roughly 1,500-2,000ft traveling at slow speeds heading south down 13th east.  I'm familiar with all flying commercial drone types as well as aircraft that are flown in the area and this matched none of those.   It was pill shaped with what looked like a clear area in the center of the craft, the middle section was completely invisible, or it was some kind of glass type material.  It looked about the size of a large sedan, completely shiny and white.   I followed it on its path for 10 minutes asking bystanders what they thought.  No one I asked had any idea as to what it was at all.  This object also made no noise at all.   I have frequently within the last 2 years seen Apache helicopters frequently performing dive bombing maneuvers above Salt Lake City.  The choppers will fly back and forth performing what look like faux attack runs, only with much more exaggerated movement than what I have previously seen in a normal operation.  There are also a number of mysterious black military choppers that fly over the city every once in a while due to Hill Air Force Base being within close proximity.;40.6566;-111.8907
White oval object zooms toward the mountains;2020-09-29 22:55:00;5 seconds;White oval object zooms toward the mountains I was on a FaceTime call with my cousin and I randomly open the door to my backyard porch. We were talking and I felt a presence over me, I looked up in the sky and I saw a white sphere, slightly pressed in the middle but not quite an oval, over the tree at our neighbors house. As Iâ€™m looking up and see it I feel like many eyes looking at me, almost like a pressure on me. The instant that I see the object it zoomed away, toward the East mountains with a white/light blue line of light. It was so fast and it made no sound. It shoot in a straight line toward the mountains in such a speed.  As it got close to the mountains it disappeared immediately. It only lasted a few seconds but it was very clear and bright. It was mind blowing!;40.6566;-111.8907
