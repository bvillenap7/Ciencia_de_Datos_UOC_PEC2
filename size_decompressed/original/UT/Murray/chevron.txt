Chevron shaped craft irregular shaped with spheres all along chevron;2012-08-03 01:30:00;10 seconds;Chevron shaped craft irregular shaped with spheres all along chevron This is the second time I've seen this... A chevron craft? About the size of a small plane hovering silently over the night sky.  My friend saw it after I pointed it out the first time last month.  Tonight I actually saw two of them.  One was going a lot faster than the second.  At first appearance it looks like a bunch of balloons but they don't waver while flying.  It's really hard to see since there were no lights on the UFO.  Not sure what they are.;40.6566;-111.8907
