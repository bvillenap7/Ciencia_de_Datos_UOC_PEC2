I was getting my 7 month old son out of his car seat I just happened to look up towards the K hill and I saw this enormouse green ball of some what looking flames. But yet the green coming offf this ball left behind light pink trails .I have seen objects in the night sky before that I had no explantation of. But this one I was so close to I watched it land ,crash, fall not exactly sure, but it looked like it went right into the K hill. After it desapaired I jumped in my car I had to go tell someone what I had seen and see if they saw it to. I dont know how thw whole town didnt seeit . The next day I was talking with this guy who worked with my husband. I told him about what I had seen the night before.
