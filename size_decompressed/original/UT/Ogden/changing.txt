Erratic movements, shape and color changing craft.;2014-11-29 21:00:00;15 minutes;Erratic movements, shape and color changing craft. The craft was making erratic movements.  I thought it may possibly be a remote controlled plane or drone, but it seemed to also change color and shape.   I viewed it from behind a water tower.  It dipped below the tower, then a few minutes later it rose again, so I ran into the house to get my dad so he could see it to.   I caught a small glimpse of it again through the trees when we first went back outside, but that was it.  It never came back up.   Oh, and the colors it changed from were white, red, and a blue or purple.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
