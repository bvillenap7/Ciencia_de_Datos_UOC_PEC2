Past Ogden exit, hw-82 going east. Saw Ufo above trees on our right about 3,000 yards away.;1998-07-20 01:00:00;15 minutes;Past Ogden exit, hw-82 going east. Saw Ufo above trees on our right about 3,000 yards away. After passing Ogden exit at 1:00am or so my husband saw a disc shaped object hovering above trees in the sky about 3,000 yrds. away from Highway 82. He commented There are no blinking lights from this object which is unusual for a flying object at night. I stopped our van off the side of the highway. We saw a disc with lights all around it glowing from inside. We saw the shape of it very well maybe from city lights or moonlight. The left and right side of the disc shape was not a pointed shape as in most photos. The shape of the disc had sharp corners more like rectangles, yet it looked like a disc. It hovered above trees for a few minutes and moved toward the right behind trees. So then I moved the van a few feet and saw it hovering again. The disc was close to the trees, did this once more, and we followed again to be able to see it. And then it went behind trees one last time and it disapeared from our vision. It did not spin or glow, it just hovered in one place for a few minutes at a time and slowly went behind trees toward our right. I had never seen a Ufo before. My husband saw one in 1978 while on duty at Fort Dix, New Jersey, 04:30am with 250-300 hundred other soldiers. As for this recent sighting this July 98', the oddest aspect to him was that there were no blinking lights, no apparent motion at times, and that the shape was large and seemed cigar shaped to him. We drew pictures of what we both saw. And what we saw was very similar. The best and frankly the only way to describe it was to draw a picture of it. And on a side note we noticed that there were many military bases nearby. We are from Wa. and we were driving to Pa.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
