They were flashing back and forth and then they would flicker and then go out and then repeat the same patern over again. On march 3 2k 22:20 I was at work ((deleted)) In ogden utah, gathering carts when I happened to see two lights in the eastern sky.  What caught my attention was the lights were flashing back and forth kind of like strob lights.  They would do this for about 4 seconds and then flicker and then go out completly for about 5 to 8 seconds before coming back to a real bright lumination.  The lights seemed to be hovering well over the wasatch mountians.  I quickly phoned my aunt and uncle and they did see the same thing about 6 blocks away.  No one that I know of saw the lights even at the store.  Do you think these could be earth lights?;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
Four lights witnessed in West Weber county;2005-06-29 22:25:00;30min;Four lights witnessed in West Weber county Were heading north on I-15 in Layton and witnessed 4 lights in the north west horizon about 5 miles away two of which had disappered.  We continued to follow the other two lights one was bright and the other small.  The big light kept blinking different colors and the small one was moving parallel to the big one.   Over time they both slowly lowered into the horizon until they eventually disappeared.  One thing to note - 15 minutes after watching these about 7-8 F-16's headed rights towards them.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836

Setting on my front porch at or about 5:30 AM looking at the morning sky,when I seen a flash of light that came from the Big Dipper that was in the N.W. sky . It looked to be a white light that was about the size of a small pin hole . It was moving S.E.at a fast speed and then turned S.W. for a few seconds and then it turned to the N.W. I followed it until it was out of sight . I then looked back at the Big Dipper and spotted another little light that was going in a broken circle and then disappeared in about the same spot the first light was seen at .;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836

A peculiar feeling came over me which caused me to look up to the southeast. I noticed a bright white light at perhaps 10,000 feet altitude. Its was a single bright light which I took to be an airplane at first. But as I was watching, somehow I knew that the occupant/s knew I had seen them. I sensed great surprise from whatever it was I was seeing. Immediately after this the craft slowed to a still hover at which time I assumed I was a looking at a helicopter. Then the light morphed so that it appeared as a star. And then it immediately shot straight up and away from the earth at a tremendous rate of speed. It faded from view and was gone. All this took place very quickly.  The whole encounter was about 20 seconds. I was born in Kingman az. My mother later revealed her own encounters and how she was directed to wreck her vehicle with me inside during the early 80s. Luckily we survived. I! believe some of my involvement has to do with me being an 11 master number according to Hebrew numerology.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
10-20 orange spheres of light viewed by 8 witnesses from Ogden, Utah in the evening .;2010-03-12 21:23:00;approx  18 min;10-20 orange spheres of light viewed by 8 witnesses from Ogden, Utah in the evening . I was in downtown Ogden, Utah, coming out of a building to the parking lot where several other people stood very excited about something in northwestern sky.   As I looked up in that direction I saw at least 8 spheres of orange lights.  One man was attempting to film this with his digital camera (which was unsuccessful).  He was looking through the zoom lens and said they looked really big in relation the foreground.  The men present also said there had been at least 15 lights earlier but  some had already dimmed. As we watched, we saw a small plane heading south to the Ogden Airport.  The lights appeared to move up and spread out more.  They all moved in a horizontal independent motion with no sound.  One of the men who was there first stated he saw them pour out of a spot in the sky 10-12 minutes earlier. As I studied the balls of light I could see that the orange glow was of nothing like I have ever seen.  It seemed to have an organic quality with a rich color and no pulsing. All of us felt we were being watched. Then to our amazement the lights snapped into geometric star formations.  Most of them drew into the Orion constellation. The remainder of the spheres spread out over our heads.  When they moved in this way, we all felt uneasy, as it was such an intelligent action. At that point all of them started to fade their color and with the naked eye you could see a dim metallic surface on the spheres like the way the dark side of the moon glows.  Within two minutes they kept fading out to be barely visible and then it was stars in their place. Note:  There are another group of witnesses who reported this occurrence which was posted that evening.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
Light in Utah sky moving erratically.;2010-06-23 03:00:00;1/2 hour;Light in Utah sky moving erratically I was looking out my bedroom window as I do every night hoping to see shooting stars.  It was overcast and all the stars were faint.  Except one in the western sky.  I was looking at it and noticed that it was moving, so I suspected that it was a plane, until I noticed the erratic way that it moved.  Up, down, left , right, sometimes in a semi circle.  Then I noticed the lights.  It seemed as if they were rotating and every once in a while you could see a red light.  I called in my son and his friend and we all watched it.  They left after about 10 minutes and I continued watching it for another 10 minutes or so.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836

Orbs sighted in mountains east Ogden;2011-07-04 22:40:00;10 minutes;Orbs sighted in mountains east Ogden Sighted large blue orbs, one was stationary another was accelerating downward as if falling down the mountain at a very quick pace.  I would suggest that the object was moving a few hundred yards in just seconds.  Also spotted an orange light near stationary orb.  Stationary object suddenly moved briskly in direction opposite of previously mentioned falling orb, the two orbs quickly moved toward each other then all three lights vanished.   Sighted about 10 minutes before lights vanished.  Objects were to high into the mountains to caused by human activates and were too close to the mountains to be aircraft.  Very strange how two orbs were so close together then appeared to be one half of a mile apart within such a small time frame.  I have experienced this type of sighting more than one time.   My only possible explanation would be extraterestial or paranormal.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
A strange, color-changing light, zigzag movements, ejecting three small lights, mimicking airplanesâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2012-07-24 22:00:00;one hour-ish;A strange, color-changing light, zigzag movements, ejecting three small lights, mimicking airplanes... We were sitting somewhere on the Bonneville Shoreline Trail intending to watch the firework displays. Soon we noticed a light that wasn't flying in any particular direction. It was zigzagging back and forth, and changing colors - red, blue, and white/yellow. I noticed when airplanes were near, it would change it's light patterns to mimic an airplane.  Eventually it ejected three small white glittery lights that fell slowly to the ground. A few minutes later and further in the distance another one did the same thing, but we didn't pay much attention to it after that.  When the original one began flying away toward the south, we decided to walk back to our cars so we could keep watching it.  It eventually flew out of view behind some mountains.  Almost to our cars, we turned around and saw a large bright light hovering in the air.  It was getting closer and closer until an airplane flew by. The bright light then switched into blinking airplane lights and began flying away in the same direction.  It even sounded like an airplane as it flew over us, but I could make out its faint disc-shaped body, and I am convinced it was not just a helicopter or an airplane. I have always been a very skeptical, critical person.  There is a military base 20 miles-ish away, so it could have been some secret machinery. Who knows? ((NUFORC Note:  Star??
