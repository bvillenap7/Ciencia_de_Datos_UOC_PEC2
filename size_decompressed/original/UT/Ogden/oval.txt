A description of the phenomenon. While driving north on 1900 West stopping at the light at 1200 South Ogden, we in the front seat were attracted by the sudden movement of an oval object looking similar to liquid mercury, being silver in color.  The object was approximately 5 miles to our North and traveling from East to West.  The  object traveled approximately 4 miles  in 2 to 3 seconds. The object was descending on a 30 degree angle and disappeared into the ground. It was too difficult to estimate the size but it was not extremely large. Your actions and reactions before, during and after the incident?  Driving north on 1900 West stopping at the light at 1200 South Ogden, UT  The event was too short to react.  As the object was obviously going to hit the ground we expected to see an explosion of some kind but nothing happened.  Only the 2 of us in the front seats saw the object   How you lost sight of the phenomenon?   The object was descending on a 30 degree angle and disappeared into the ground somewhere near Farr West or Plain City.  No farther than 4000 North nor closer than 2700 North.  West of the Freeway I15. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
