It was a clear dark night.  I saw a bright green flash it was a oval shape but it looked like it had petals all around it.  Something you would see on a flower, there was no tail of any kind.  I happened to be at the right place and the right time at the right second.  It only lasted a second.  In a blink of a eye it was gone.   From where I was at it looked huge.  I know it wasn't a shooting star or anything like that.   I have never seen anything like it.  It was very exciting.  I wasnt sure what to think.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
