The lights were really bright then they went really dim.....and dimmer....and dimmer;2007-01-19 23:45:00;3 minutes;The lights were really bright then they went really dim.....and dimmer....and dimmer Well I was taking a little drive up the canyon cause I had gotton in an argument with my girl-friend I went into Snow Basin, and as I was driving I saw something that looked like a tear-drop, I thought well that cant be any ordinary star, so I drove closer to it. It was maybe 5 ft tall and maybe 2 ft in diamiter, there was about 3 windows going diagnal at 1st the lights were very bright, but then they got dimmer and dimmer, then I thought I saw someone in there and they must have saw me becauase the object zoomed of straight up into the sky REALLY fast. The lights were still really dim though I could barley see it going up. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax?  PD));41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
