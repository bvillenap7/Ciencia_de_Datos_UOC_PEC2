Moved 3 miles in approximately 5 seconds. While looking at the star lit evening my wife and I suddenly noticed a very fast moving craft that sped across the sky and covered 2-3 miles in approximately 5 seconds.   The craft did not have lights but was rather a solid substance that appeared to be slightly lighter than the surrounding stars.  A good description is like when you see a jelly fish in water.  It is difficult to see the outlines but you can tell that there is a substance there.   The craft moved silently, and quickly with no sound and was probably only able to be picked up due to the fact that there was a bright quarter moon out also.  It originally reminded me of a batman movie when there was the bat signal in the sky.  Delta shape with softly rounded corners, no flashing lights, but only can be described as a disruption of the space around it.   Perhaps a cloaking device was enabled but one could still make out the speed and shape due to the disruption around it;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
