I was setting on my front porch looking up at the stars when I noticed two points of light that looked like one following the other.The direction of travel was from NW to SE.I could not hear any engine sound like from a airplane,thy made no sound at all.I had enough time to call my daughter outside so she could have a look.The whole thing took about 2mins. I'm 45yrs. old and have seen aircrafts at night before but none that remained lit up from horizon to horizon.They were to high and the black sky made it impossable to see a shape our color other then the white light.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
5 large lights hovered above Ogden, Utah, before disappearing one by one.;2016-04-06 19:55:00;1 minute;5 large lights hovered above Ogden, Utah, before disappearing one by one. So at this time of year in Eden, it's still light outside, but the sun has gone under the mountains, so it's brightest around the rims of the mountains and fades darker as it gets further from the sun.  Basically dusk.  This type of lighting makes it very easy to see airplanes that typically fly over Ogden, because of the nearby SLC International Airport. I had just walked upstairs and sat on my bed, and I have a direct view of the mountains separating Ogden and Eden (Eden being where I was.)  There was a plane flying right over the North Ogden Divide, so I looked up from my laptop for a second to look at it for a moment. It was then that I noticed a strange formation of lights to the right of the plane. There were 5 lights, each one about a half of the size of the plane.  They were in a slightly curved formation.  Three of them were in a straight line, and there were two slightly lower than the others on either side of the three. It was so large I feel like it spanned about a mile, because it hovered over an entire mountain peak.  Each dot was completely unmoving.  The color of each dot was indescribable, and I'd never seen the color before.  At a glance it was white with a reddish hue, but then it was also blue or purple if you looked again.  It was as if it was all of those colors at once. Within a minute of me spotting it, it started disappearing one light by one, before it was gone completely. I'm not sure if it was a single craft or 5, because it was only seen as multiple lights. It was very bold and I noticed it the moment I looked up. It was just so bright and bold that I was surprised I wasnâ€™t getting fearful texts from my friends and news stories breaking out everywhere.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
Formation of bright non-flashing lights hovering too large to be a plane.;2016-05-22 23:43:00;1 minute;Formation of bright non-flashing lights hovering too large to be a plane. As I was coming down 4600 towards Harrison Boulevard, I saw a vertical row of 3 large white lights flanked by 2 or 3 smaller lights.  When I saw it, my heart almost stopped because I immediately thought a commercial plane was flying too low.   It wasn't until I slowed my car down at the corner of 4600 and Taylor Ave that I saw no movement with the lights and that it wasn't at all close, it was just the size of the lights that had made it appear low flying.  They weren't flashing, but I immediately assumed it was an airplane or a jet from Hill Air Force Base, until I processed how incredibly large of a plane it would have to be and that it wasn't moving at all.   I turned and continued driving a block north before deciding that even if this was a plane, it wasn't one I had ever seen before and wanted a closer look so I turned back down to Harrison and it was completely gone.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
Dragon-like wavy orange and red streaks seen in Ogden.  ((NUFORC Note:  Chinese rocket re-entry.  PD));2016-07-27 22:45:00;10 seconds;Dragon-like wavy orange and red streaks seen in Ogden My wife and I were driving around on 40th towards Harrison Blvd trying to put our son to sleep, when we saw dragon-like wavy lights on the right in the southeast.  At first we thought we had seen fireworks  but the lights panned a very big stretch of the sky. They moved from S to SE.  It was a wavy formation with bright orange and faint red streaks. It seemed to cover a very long distance very quickly.  The wavy formation disappeared as it reached far SE corner of the sky.  While we are willing to consider this as a UFO phenomena, our rationale was that it might be fireworks or drones that the local Air Force Base maybe flying around. It just moved to quickly, silently and strangely across a very big span.  I'm hoping the others in the area saw it too. ((NUFORC Note:  Chinese rocket re-entry.

Bright orange objects above Salt Lake.;2018-02-03 19:30:00;8 minutes;Bright orange objects above Salt Lake.   Walked outside my house facing due west over the northern part of the salt lake 9 bright orange lights super bright almost like fireworks roughly 4 to 5 inches above the horizon.  Almost instantly apon observing the objects some seem to break apart and others seen to merge all while not necessarily falling to the horizon but also not ascending. Withing 35 seconds all but 6 where left.  That's when I started recording. I have recorded 4 bright lights hanging in the sky above the horizon.  As the most northern one started to disappear another began to what seem like rise.  Between 5 to 8 minutes after the last object disappeared from view you could hear jets scrambling from hill air force.  I have almost 5 minutes of credible film similar to the Phoenix lights tape.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
