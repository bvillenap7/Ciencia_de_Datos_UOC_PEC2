I saw a blue ball of light and it flashed approx. 2000 ft in the sky.  It was bright, and it did not move.  Then it got really dim and it then turned back on for about a second or two and moved about 2 seconds or so to the right from my perspective.  There were no military jets or plane lights nearby so I know it was not a plane or a flare or a spotlight because I know where the spotlight here in Ogden is and I was not close enough to itâ€¦;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
