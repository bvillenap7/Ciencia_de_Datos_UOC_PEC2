It was very very high, reflected light like a mirror, we could see it with the naked eye.  It moved slowly to the north and faded out of sight over a period of about ten minutes.  When we first saw it, it was directly over head. I thought maybe it was the ISS but I checked NASA's website and the ISS was no where near where we were looking.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
