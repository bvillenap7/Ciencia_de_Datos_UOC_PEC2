It is hard to describe because it was inside a cloud. It had an outer ring of triangular lights that were bluish white. They fashed one at a time around in a circle, sometimes faster sometimes slower. It had an inner ring of lights that moved as if it were opening and closing sort of like jellyfish do when propelling themselves forward. It did not move it just hovered there for hours, Gradually getting higher in they sky as the sun rose. I stood under it and so did my kids and neighbor. It didn't make any sound. It was reported in our local paper and policemen had seen it ect.  Hundreds have seenit but we do live by a Air Force Base and so most of us just figure that it is a new plane or something. Many witnessed it moving from Ogden area to the Layton area , to my area.  I would like to know if anyone else saw this and could explain what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  However, it has been reported to NUFORC that there is a laboratory, run by either a university or a company, that frequently uses a high-energy blue-green laser in the night sky.  We do not know its location.  This may have been the cause of the 3-hour sighting.  PD));41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836

Strange round object flashing multicolored lights, moving very slowly, coming to complete stop for several minutes.;2005-11-22 23:45:00;30 minutes;Strange round object flashing multicolored lights, moving very slowly, coming to complete stop for several minutes. We were outside smoking, we saw a strange round object flashing multi-colored lights, moving slowly, stopping, changing directions.  Very high, well above the wasatch mountains.  We took some video tape of the object on our video camera as well as on our digital camera. I can't imagine what it could be, possibly a hot air balloon??? I checked I would like to be contacted, but if there is a known explanation for this object, please don't worry about contacting, or just drop a short email, if you want I will email the footage we took.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
