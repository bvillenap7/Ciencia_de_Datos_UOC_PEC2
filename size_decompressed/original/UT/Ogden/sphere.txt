Large spherical craft with 2 lights rotating around the object;2008-12-31 09:15:00;5 minutes;Large spherical craft with 2 lights rotating around the object On December 31st, 2008, at approximately 9:15 A.M., I watched an object, originally thought to be a balloon, drift from the NW sky to the SE sky over Ogden, UT.  As the object moved slowly toward my location, itâ€™s shape and detail became larger and more visible.  It was spherical, orb-like in shape.  It had 2 visible bright lights that appeared to go AROUND the object, 1 red, 1 white.  I watched this object for about 5 minutes before it instantly disappeared.  Soon after the sighting, military jets were witnessed travelling in the same sky area as the object.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
Spherical orb over the mountains in North Ogden Utah;2009-05-31 17:00:00;5 MIN.;Spherical orb over the mountains in North Ogden Utah Walking to work on Sunday Memorial Day Weekend.  Walking down Hwy 89 past Ben Lomond Golf Course.  I saw a spherical object up over the mountain far to the right side of Ben Lomond Mountain.  I thought it was a familar vintage helicopter I've seen before.  It had a bright flashing light which I now believe was sun reflecting off one part and it rotated.  However, it was stationary only slightly moving either towards or away from me.  It started traveling upwards and then did so at a constant velocity.  It went up and up for a very long time until I could no longer see it.  Then a big silver military plane flew over the mountain area at a very high altitude.  No sounds or emissions of any sort.   Someone else here in Ogden saw something exactly the same as this  on 1/10/2009.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
Fastest thing I've ever seen--unbelievable!;2013-11-02 01:25:00;1 second;Fastest thing I've ever seen - unbelievable! Woke to helicopter sounds.  Looked out south window and saw an orange ball with no flashers that travelled from Ogden, north to south, towards Salt Lake City in about three seconds.   It was followed by low flying, big helicopters, with flashers, thereafter.   Holy cow that thing was flying fast!  No sound to the object.  Supersonic with no sound!  Perfectly quiet!;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
