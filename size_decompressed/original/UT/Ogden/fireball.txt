Brilliant fireball seen near Ogden, UT.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2005-11-15 19:37:00;2 seconds;Brilliant fireball seen near Ogden, UT Returning home from an errand, we (my 15 year old daughter, who did not see the fireball, my 12 yo son and myself) were eastbound on a neighborhood street and saw a fireball to the north of us.   Airplanes were in the area, as we are in a congested area, with a major international airport to the south of us, Hill Air Force Base only about 3 miles north of us and a smaller airport about 3-5 miles north of that.   At first, I thought this was just normal landing lights which are seen frequently, but because of the speed, direction and brilliance, this caught our eye.  Our location at the time was in east Layton, UT and the fireball appeared due north of us, or (given the visibility that night) approximately due east of Ogden, UT, and appeared as if it were directly over the mountains.   The fireball traveled quickly, was very bright (considering there was a full moon out, the object was very brilliant) and its line of travel was approximately NNW.  It traveled about the same speed as other meteors I have seen (i.e., quite fast) although the direction (a bit west of north) was unusual.   Less than a minute later, planes (distinguishable by their navigation lights) could be seen making their routine turns in their approach to land in Salt Lake and elsewhere, but this was no airplane.  A meteor, yes, but no airplane. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Taurid meteor??  PD));41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
