Large Triangle space craft seen from Northern Utah Traveling South out of the North sky 10-12-07 at 12:20am;2007-10-12 00:20:00;10 seconds;Large Triangle space craft seen from Northern Utah Traveling South out of the North sky 10-12-07 at 12:20am Tonight sitting in my hot tub,looking at all the night sky at aprox 12:20am I saw a Very Large Triangle shaped space craft with white lights.1 on each corner and 1 about 1/3 from the front in the center.  All lights were a fused white not a bright white.  The craft was not in the earths atomosphere as there was No vapor trail it was traveling very fast across the sky out of the North.  It traveled directly South it took aprox 10 seconds from first seeing until it was out of sight.  It was the biggest Thing I have ever seen. The craft was a solid triangle it blocked the stars from view as it went past.  I have seen all that our space program and Military have to offer and this craft was not from this planet.  Hopefully someone else witnessed it.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
low flying silent triangular object with no lights.;2013-05-16 22:10:00;15 seconds;low flying silent triangular object with no lights. I was leaning out my door calling my dogs in when something caught my eye above me to the west. I saw a triangular object moving from south to north.  It didnt have any lights and was absolutely silent.   I didnt have any lights on in my house or outside but could see it because there is a park and baseball field about 200 yards away to the south of my house.  The lights at the baseball field light up the sky very well at night and i could see the underside of the craft.  It appeared metalic by the way the light reflected off of it.  It's hard to say the size of the craft.  It was flying low enough to reflect the light from the ball fields so i cant imagine it being any higher than a 300 hundred feet above and it appeared fairly large at that distance.  It was out of my sight in about 10 seconds.;41.2410492063491;-111.970135978836
