Bright light flying out of our atmosphere above Yuba Lake, UT.;2011-06-25 00:00:00;5 seconds;Bright light flying out of our atmosphere above Yuba Lake, UT. Camping at Yuba lake with several family memebers, we decided to star gaze.   The light came from behind the mountains, slowly picking up speed and the eventually dispersed and was no longer visible.  There were no signs of it being an airplane as it was a constant light.   My first thought is that it might be a shooting star, but it had no constant speed and drifted off course several times.  There were three shooting stars shortly after the light was gone, flying in the opposite direction of the object all in the same general area.   Nothing else was spotted the rest of the night.
