I was riding with my mom back to her home in central Utah from the Salt Lake City area late at night. We were chatting and I was looking out the passenger-side window toward the mountains to the west as we headed south on Highway 28 just south of Levan. I saw what I initially thought was a helicopter hovering in the distance with a bright spotlight apparently searching for something. There’s not much over there except for fields, I-15 and then mountains. I turned to my mom and said, “Look over there at the helicopter. What do you think they’re looking for?” She turned to look and was about to respond when the object zipped toward us in a second and the bright light that had been moving around the fields in the distance was now “looking” right at my mom. The object hovered just outside my passenger window and matched our speed as we drove about 65 mph. After 2-3 seconds the light turned to “look” at me, and I started to ask if my mom was seeing this when it q! uickly turned back to the west and in a flash was gone. I could see the light speed away over the mountains. I repeated my question to see if my mom saw what I saw and she confirmed. We kept asking each other what we thought it was for the rest of the drive.  The object was hard to see in the dark and behind the bright light, however, it was about 3-4 feet wide and 2-3 feet tall. It may have been either circular or disc shaped. The light looked like a helicopter searchlight in the field and then was not as intense when it shown on us from just outside the window. There was no discernible sound coming from the object.;39.5239;-111.9456
