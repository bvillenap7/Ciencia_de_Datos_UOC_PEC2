My wife and I were in the pool in the backyard.  We were commenting on how we could see the milky-way that night.   I noticed a shadow pass in front of the stars.  I asked my wife if she could see what I saw.   The shadow appeared to be triangular in shape and had a faint florescent green light in the center and the same color halo around it.   From it traveled from the south horizon to the north horizon in approximately 45 seconds.   There was no sound and no other indicators of the object other then visual.;39.9539;-111.9059
