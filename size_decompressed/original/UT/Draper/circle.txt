Up high, down low, over the mountains.  They didn't move together but separately.    One remained bright green while the other one changed from bright white to blue to red.  They moved VERY fast in various directions.  They would disappear then would suddenly reappear.  It was wild! Two adults, two teenagers, and one ten year old witnessed this.;40.5084000000001;-111.8838
Large round light descending out of the sky onto Draper Parkway onto the cars and disappeared.;2010-12-16 18:40:00;2 minutes;Large round light descending out of the sky onto Draper Parkway onto the cars and disappeared. Driving east on Draper Parkway (12300 South) and approximately 4th East, my neighbor who was in the car with me, asked what the large round light was up in the sky straight ahead of us to the east.  I had been focusing on the traffic since it was dark and I was driving, however, I glanced up and saw what she was talking about.  It was descending from the sky and was about to land on the traffic ahead of us - slightly further east.  I pulled off to the side of the road as it looked like it was going to collide with the traffic on the busy road just ahead of us.  We were amazed that there was no collision and it just disappeared.  We're sure that other people must have observed this and are bewildered as to what it was.

Driving saw a bright light above the car and a circular round plate looking object;2012-03-09 00:45:00;15 seconds;driving saw a bright light above the car and a circular round plate looking object My Girlfriend and I were driving down from Suncrest Utah to Draper Utah along the way it's a winding canyon road in front of us was a small car and another car in front of that. we were going about 30 mph down the road when I noticed a white bright light.  I first noticed it from the upper left of my front windshield.  It was very bright and white like that of a L.E.D. light but a lot stronger it was about 50-100 feet above us it lit up the road and the car in front of us, then all of a sudden the light was gone and it flew into the canyon, as it was flying off I followed it with my eyes it was the shape of a plate round and for the most part flat. I could only see the shadow of it.  At the same time it had flown off into the canyon the car in front of me sped off really quickly.  My girlfriend at the time saw the light she did not see the object as she states, I was too afraid to look at it she at first thought it was a bird or a helicopter, I do not believe ! it was a bird or helicopter as it made no noise whatsoever. My stomach dropped and my heart raced as soon as I saw it.  I know it was a UFO I have seen videos and pictures online since I was young and this is what it was.  The car in front of me unfortunately did not slow down or anything I wish we could have discussed what that was with the individual in that car.;40.5084000000001;-111.8838
