I was on my lunch trying to take a good photo my the flapping flag. I didn't realise I'd caught the sighting until I later viewed the pictures. I took 2 pictures - 10 seconds after and the image wasn't there! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness forwarded two photographs.  One object has an unidentified object in it, which appears to us to be a seagull.  It has a which head, and gray on the side visible to the viewer.  There are seagulls in Utah.  PD));40.5084000000001;-111.8838
