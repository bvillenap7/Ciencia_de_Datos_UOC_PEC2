Green flashes with booms in the night sky.;2007-08-11 22:30:00;1 minute;Green flashes with booms in the night sky. My 2 friends and one of my friend's neices, and I were in her backyard. We were laying on her trampoline looking up into the sky. We noticed that there were shooting stars. About a minute after we sighted shooting stars, we looked to the Southeast sky. Greenish-bluish flashes started occuring. There were about 6 flashes. They were in one area of the sky high up. They lasted about 30 seconds Then the flashes stopped. The sky went dim over there. About 10 seconds later, we heard 2 booms in the area of the flashes. Then everything went quiet.;40.5084000000001;-111.8838
2 bright red lights heading south, vanishing over south mountain.;2014-02-24 21:00:00;7;2 bright red lights heading south, vanishing over south mountain. A good friend and I had just got back from the store and were walking to my door when something caught our eye to the north.  We looked and saw 2 very bright red lights, brighter than jupiter which was directly overhead at the time.   The lights were heading south, they were apart from each other and had no flashing lights on them like an airplane or helicopter would, they made no noise and seemed to be moving much like a satellite would in space until they were over south mountain when one vanished and the other faded a bit and then was heading due east toward Alpine and then vanished.   I know my stars and my aircraft and I have never seen anything like this in my life, no explanation, no clue what it could be except something from another world. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.5084000000001;-111.8838

Three glowing yellow orbs.;2015-01-11 20:40:00;5 minutes;Three glowing yellow orbs followed each other with less than a mile distance between each, from the Little Cottonwood Canyon area, and began a slow climb to the south along the Wasatch range.  Each disappeared at a time into overcast approximately 4,500 feet base near the east end of Suncrest.   My son, wife and I all observed this from our driveway in Draper.   None of the objects had any aircraft type navigation lights or beacons on them.;40.5084000000001;-111.8838
Parade of lights high altitude, evenly spaced, no variation from the first to the last that I saw.   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-01 05:15:00;ABT 10Min;Parade of lights high altitude, evenly spaced, no variation from the first to the last that I saw. 10 I went out to sit in the hot tub at about. 5:00 am.  I finally looked up and saw this parade of lights at high altitude going from NW to SE. They were traveling far enough where I could see 3 at a time.  When the first one would fade away I looked for another.  And there was.  I don't know if I saw the beginning or not but I got up to 10 and could see no more.  Evenly spaced out, Straight line.  No variation from one to the next.  It seamed like they were spaced out 35 seconds.  But whatever it was, it was consistent from one to the next.;40.5084000000001;-111.8838
