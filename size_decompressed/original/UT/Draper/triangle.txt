Triangular, shadowy, silent shapes moving south across the Draper sky;2008-08-28 21:20:00;30 min;Triangular, shadowy, silent shapes moving south across the Draper sky Around 21:30-22:00, a few friends and I were sitting on the lawn of a condo talking when one of them pointed out a high, dark, triangular shape moving south across the night sky. She and I watched it for a while until it disappeared. The others we were with thought maybe it was a bird or something. It was large and completely silent. No lights, just a dark shape. We didn’t think about it much until tonight when the same girl who spotted it before and I were sitting at the park and I was looking at the stars and saw the same shadowy shape moving in the sky. The same as before, it moved south and kind of faded away. They kept coming and coming, sometimes lower and sometimes as high as before. When they were close they were so big that I thought maybe it was a hang-glider. When they were closer they seemed to have some lighter colored spots on them, but I’m not positive. They are exactly the same as some of the posted entries for Sandy during the summer of 2007. Scared the hell out of me.;40.5084000000001;-111.8838
Triangular, translucent object seen in Draper sky;2013-07-27 21:10:00;3 seconds;Triangular, translucent object seen in Draper sky My husband, children, and I were driving home from the store when both my son and I noticed a triangular, translucent object in the sky.  It was translucent but still had a definite shape to it.  It was yellow-green.  It had two dim lights.  Not like search lights.  More like ones you would see on a vcr.  The top light was a darker teal/green and the bottow light was lemon/lime in color.  The object seemed to be sizeable and appeared to be two blocks from where we were at.  It disappeared quickly.  When my son and I saw it, it was sideways.   I think that is why it left our view so quickly.  Like the side view was invisible if that makes sense.  It didn't hover like a frisbee, it was perpendicular to the horizon and looked 3 dimensional.;40.5084000000001;-111.8838
