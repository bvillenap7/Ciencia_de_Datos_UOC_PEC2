We were traveling south on the old Medina Road which is approximately 5 to 6 miles from Enterprise Utah.   To the west, in the Escalante Mountains, were 5 rectangular shaped lights in an uneven row.  There was no horizontal or vertical movement.   They were yellowish orange in color and had a pulsating movement to them.  On each side of the group of 5 were a bright, bluish-white light.   The rectangle lights lasted about 9 to 10 seconds and went off one by one, left to right.  The bluish-white lights lingered on after the yellowish lights went out about 5 to 6 seconds longer.;37.579;-113.6854
