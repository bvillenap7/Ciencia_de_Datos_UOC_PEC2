A green light descending from the sky;1992-09-21 22:00:00;several minutes;A green light descending from the sky I have experienced three sightings of UFOs in my lifetime.  The second sighting was in September 1992 in Western Utah.  I was traveling west on U.S. Highway 40 to Salt Lake City with a friend.  It was around 10 o'clock in the evening.  It is VERY dark in this remote area of the world with no street lights.  We saw a very bright green light that was descending from the night sky at a very slow pace.  As I drove I was watching it for several minutes in disbelief as it silently approached the ground.  It was probably 2 to 3 miles away.  Remember, this is the American West where views can be 50 to 100 miles.  And we had unobstructed views of the valley.   What was most memorable about this sighting was the slow rate of descent.  Amazing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));40.1687;-110.403
Orange light making strange turns.;2020-11-18 23:15:00;2 minutes;Orange light making strange turns. My wife and I were outside around 23:15 on 10/18.  My wife pointed out what appeared to be a satellite moving from northeast to southwest.  It was only a dull orange light. We couldnâ€™t see any of the craft or hear any sound.  At first, it was going in a straight line at a speed that was faster than most of the satellites we see . It then made an extremely tight 180 degree turn without slowing down.  It went northeast for a short distance before turning north and making a series of strange turns.  It then turned and went west before going out of site.;40.1687;-110.403
