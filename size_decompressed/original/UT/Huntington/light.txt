I'm 15 and this happened over a year ago and I just found this place to submit this.Me and my friend were sleeping in my backyard when a green light streaked halfway acrossthe sky and then just disappered. The whole thing only lasted about 5 or 6 seconds. Then about 5 minutes later we saw it streak by again then it dissapered again and we've never seen it again.;39.3266;-110.9642
two lights adjacent to each other going from west to east, looking light two pieces of space debris;2001-07-27 23:45:00;2 minutes;two lights adjacent to each other going from west to east, looking light two pieces of space debris My 11 year old son and I love to look at space debris floating overhead in the night sky. We were following one piece going from south to north at either 10:45 or 11:45 in a campground a mile or so upstream from the power plant in Huntington Creek canyon in Central Utah. Suddenly, two pieces caught our eyes that looked about a mile or so apart from each other, but were both going the same speed from west to east.They traveled the same speed as the other stuff we see. What was that?! I can't be sure, but once in a while I thought I saw a third light in front of the two lights, forming a triangle of sorts.;39.3266;-110.9642
