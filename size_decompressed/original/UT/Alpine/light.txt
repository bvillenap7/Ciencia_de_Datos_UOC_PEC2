Cluster of 50-60 moving lights in the night sky over Alpine, Utah.  ((anonymous report));2019-03-29 22:15:00;15 minutes;Cluster of 50-60 moving lights in the night sky over Alpine, Utah. Looking out of the window at the eastern night sky, my husband saw a cluster of 50-60 lights that looked like stars, move westward over the mountain towards us.  The cluster moved slowly and silently.  We went outside to watch them as they stopped then moved north, the cluster shape changing.  They slowed, then one by one the lights started moving south in a single file.  The whole process took about 15 minutes until the lights were out of our line of sight.
