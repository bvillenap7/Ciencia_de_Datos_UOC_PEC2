While walking up Alpine Cemetery to go sledding, a group of us saw a flashing light in the sky. It was too close to be an airplane, so we all thought it was a helicopter, and it was just going around alpine for New Years Eve. The light started to dim and then quickly got bright and flashed throughout the sky.  Right after this happened we saw a few more lights quickly moving in multiple directions and then shooting off into the distance, there were a few flashes during all this.  There seemed to be a tint of green in the light.;40.4599;-111.7752
Disc flares and disappears over Mt. Timpanogos, UT 4 Sep 12;2012-09-04 20:30:00;5 seconds;Disc flares and disappears over Mt. Timpanogos, UT 4 Sep 12 A friend and I went camping Tues 4 Sep in what's known as the Alpine Loop in the Wasatch Mountains. About 8:30pm Mountain Time, as we started looking up to see the stars,  I noticed what I originally thought was a planet - in the NW sky about 45-55 degrees from horizon (I'm no astronomer so I don't know how to describe the coordinates any better than that). This &quotplanet&quot flared suddenly and brightened and grew considerably - I would estimate at peak it appeared the size of 2-3 Venuses. Magnitude was what I'd expect if Venus grew that large. The flare turned a  pinkish color - to the point it looked like a &quotmini carnation&quot flower in the sky. It faded to nothing within 5 seconds or less. Sky condition was completely clear - esp. so as we were at an elevation of 7100 ft. I wrote to a sky phenomenon web site - their best guess was an Iridium satellite flare but none were visible in UT at that hour and date. I'm wondering if anyone else has reported seeing this phenomenon - we know we both saw something - but it defies any description.;40.4599;-111.7752
