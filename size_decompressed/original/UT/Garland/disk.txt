Two V-shaped patterns of discs in broad daylight.;2018-09-16 13:35:00;5-10 minutes;Two V-shaped patterns of discs in broad daylight. Day time sighting – Garland, UT.  I was sitting outside in my lawn chair and noticed a “V” formation of white objects coming slowly from the North West.  At first I thought they were birds until they were in a direct North position.   I went in the house and grabbed my 10-30X60 Zoom binoculars and went back out to take a look.  Observation:  A “V” shaped pattern of 20 craft moving slowly to the South East.  Through the binoculars I could see that they were Disc shaped and very reflective, I observed them until they crossed the East Mountains and went out of sight.   I turned back North and observed a Very Large jet moving slowly in the same direction, once again, with binoculars, I could see that there were no markings at all, it was pure white, had no windows and made no sound.  While observing the jet, another formation of 20 craft was coming from the north.  I watch as they slowly turned South East in the same direction as the first group and the jet and watched until they too went behind the East Mountains.   The entire event lasted between 5 and 10 minutes.  Unfortunately, no video or camera was available.   Others must have seen this, most of the event was visible to the naked eye.;41.7384;-112.1552
