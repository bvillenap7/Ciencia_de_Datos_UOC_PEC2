Bright bold flash of a space craft fly down and out of the sky in Utah.;2020-01-04 02:19:00;7 seconds;Bright bold flash of a space craft fly down and out of the sky in Utah. My Girlfriend and I were driving down the street for a late night run to the grocery store.  Barely left the house haven’t even exited the street.  Us both starring out the windshield East towards the Wasatch mountains noticed a huge bright green/blue orb streaking downward into the sky and then blasted outward vanishing right in front of both of our eyes.  Mind you this is at 2:19 am he stopped the car and we got out to look at the sky and we were in just disbelief of what we just saw.  It was all pretty fast.  It blasted downward for like 4 seconds it was such a bright bold flash of faint blue and then zoomed up and we could both see the front of a ship/disk-like craft flash out of the sky.  The back of craft seemed like it was cloaked to the night sky but also had green lights around it.  Overall it was in the sky for about 5-8 seconds.  We both saw a faint trail after it vanished.  It definitely looked like it hit light speed and was gone.;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941

I came outside to see and she pointed at a cloud against the night sky and clearly a u shaped grayish object with a black center was zig zagging like a snake through the cloud then it disappeared.  I would think this object was pretty big being that it looked large in the clouds and the clouds were at least several thousand feet in the air.  minutes later to the south of us I noticed 3 stars in the sky get blocked out by what looked like a stationary or slow moving cloud until the cloud dove straight down towards the ground and evaporated before my eyes and the stars that were blocked out were back. minutes after that that same cloud was over my house and moved to the west faster than a cloud moves and once again disappeared. shortly after this with in 3-5 minutes that cloud formation which was roughly the! size of a bus moved over my house quickly again and heading south and evaporated not before my daughter and I witnessed 5 or six glowing lights within the cloud.  until it disappeared over my neighbors house.;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941
Three witness White and red sphere that changed shapes near army base;2021-07-04 21:50:00;51/2 minutes;Three witness White and red sphere that changed shapes near army base At approximately 21:50 on 07/04/2021 I noticed some clouds glowing, so I asked a friend of mine if she noticed it. Soon after bringing it to her attention a glowing object appeared. It was moving in  different directions, at first it looked like a small glowing ball then grew in size. I then yell for my mother to look to make sure I wasn’t just seeing things. All three of us could see it. At first my mom made a joke about it being aliens, then it started flashing bright white then red. First I thought it could be a drone but then it changed shapes. My friend made a comment that it reminded her of a jellyfish. A plane flew right under it and the object was much bigger than the plane. It would go up then straight down and back up while changing colors and shape. This lasted approximately 5 1/2 minutes until it flew down and we could no longer see it passed my neighbors home.;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941
