This happened on July 20th, 2019 in West Jordan, UT. I was in my backyard about 7:10 pm, reclining in a lounge chair. I was staring up in the sky thinking of my deceased mom.  I suddenly became aware of a bright light extremely high up in the sky. I could see it was reflecting light but I could tell it was way too high for an airplane, and a helicopter can’t go as high as this was.  I was watching it and realized it wasn’t moving, but just sitting there. Suddenly 3 more lights appeared, moving and took a formation around the first light, to the left. They all sat there for several minutes when they All started moving and changed formation, then sat there several more minutes.  This went on and on, them moving and taking different formations, then sitting, for about 20-25 minutes. Then they all seem to back up and just disappear.  I did get photos of these lights in the sky.  I watched for about another half hour and they never reappeared, so I started to relax and play with my dog.  I kept glancing up, and about the 3rd time I glanced up, I about died of shock. There, right in front of me, flying over the backyard right next to mine (to the east) was two UFOs. They were flying fast, and were perfectly aligned, like a mirror image. They were white, and they were cylindrical shape. They were completely silent, no sound, no vibration.  I could see them perfectly as they were very low. I was just telling myself “Study them, Study them!” There were no windows. They each had an extremely light bright circling around each one of them around their center, and meeting in the middle of the two, which were what looked like a few feet apart from each other.  They glowed exceedingly. They flew over her yard, their roof, and then they were out of my sight. I jumped up and looked for them but they were gone. I didn’t see where they went but I couldn’t see them  anywhere.;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941

I guess the approximate altitude about 20,000 feet. The object moved north and hovered in one spot for the duration of the sighting. It appeared to the naked eye as a small bright white light.  When I viewed it through binoculars, the shape was cylindrical with two small cylindrical objects the the each side. Half the the length of the main object.  It was grey in color and the two objects on the side are either engines or reflectors.;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941
