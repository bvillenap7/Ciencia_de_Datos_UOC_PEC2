Dark, teardrop shape without light, moving faster than normal planes, made no noise;2006-09-30 23:30:00;20 seconds;Dark, teardrop shape without light, moving faster than normal planes, made no noise We were sitting in the hot tub at 23:30.  I said there's a shooting star, then said that's not a star, look.  We estimate that the object was over the city of Murray or Midvale which is directly east of us by about 5 miles.  There were no obvious lights on the object but it appeared quite large.  It was shaped similar to a teardrop, my wife compared it to a someone attached to a parachute. The object moved very quickly to the north, much faster than the airlines that fly in patterns over our home daily.  It appeared much lower than normal flights of planes.  The shape was a gray or dark outline without obvious lighting.  It moved north, then west, then was lost from our sight. The object made no noise.;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941
