Bright blue flashing towards the top of the Wasatch mountains;2013-12-20 22:00:00;5 minutes;Bright blue flashing towards the top of the Wasatch mountains.  We were quite a distance away and it was very bright and the blue light looked like it was very large.  It wasn't lightning and was similar to a transformer blowing but larger and brighter and it was up in the mountains.  My husband, my 16 year old daughter, & I all saw it.  My husband has a degree in computer networking and I have gone to school for medical assisting.  My daughter is in high school and is a pretty level heading young lady.;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941
