Triangle object seen for approx. 8 minutes west of  Mount Olympus near Salt Lake City, Utah;2009-07-08 20:43:00;8 minutes;Triangle object seen for approx. 8 minutes west of  Mount Olympus near Salt Lake City, Utah I was taking pictures of the mountains in the distance at sunset and as I zoomed in on the mountains this triangle shaped object became visible. The object is seen in 7 different pictures in 7 slightly locations. The 8th picture was taken 6 seconds after the 7th picture and the object in not visible in the 8th picture. I was miles away from the object so no sound was heard. In one picture it looks like a vapor trail can be seen. The pictures are still on my memory card.

Though a former military air traffic controller, I've never seen anything like it.;2017-07-28 16:00:00;30 seconds;Though a former military air traffic controller, I've never seen anything like it. I watched as a silvery triangular shaped craft flew overhead.   Though unsure of its size, I estimate an altitude of 10,000 ft.  The entire craft seemed to pulse a bright white light at about one second intervals.  It tracked a course of due north at approximately Mach 2, but gave off no noise at all.;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941

We saw about 3 of them at different times.  One was going towards the stars then disappeared and then it was really close to us, and then again we saw the same shape flying higher above us.;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941
