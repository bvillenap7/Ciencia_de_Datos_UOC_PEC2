Bright stationary light above Oquirrh mountains – seen for 30-40 minutes;2011-12-25 18:45:00;30-40 minutes;Bright stationary light above Oquirrh mountains – seen for 30-40 minutes My family and I were driving from Herriman to our home in West Jordan on the benches of the Oquirrh Mountains.  As we drove west up 11800 South (west of Herriman High School) toward Bacchus Highway, I noticed a large light in the sky. I wondered at first if this was an airplane, due to its brightness, however the object didn’t appear to move. It remained stationary in the sky, slightly elevated above the top of the mountain range.  I pointed it out to my spouse who could clearly see it. I watched the light the entire time during our drive back home, about 15-20 minutes. The light was still visible by the time we arrived home. I quickly went inside to get my small video camera and went out onto the stairs behind our house. I was able to film the object for approximately 5-6 minutes. I am not very talented when it comes filming, so the video is shaky. I had to zoom out and in several times, but once I was able to locate it in the viewfinder I saw it fairly clearly. I watched the object as closely as I could. It appeared to grow larger and smaller, possibly brighter and dimmer, but always quite bright. When it appeared larger, I could just make out a smaller ball of more concentrated light in the center. I was able to film what appeared to be something solid moving across the front of the object from left to right, which obstructed the light. It reminded me a bit of a lunar eclipse, but the dark form blocking the light in front of the object wasn’t as big as t! he object itself. After watching the object for about 5-6 minutes on camera, it gently dimmed and vanished. I waited with the camera rolling for about one more minute to see if it would come back, but it was cold and I decided to go inside without seeing it again. I checked outside several times that night to see if it had re-appeared, but I never saw it.  I have been looking for it every day since, and I haven’t seen it again.  I know there is other amateur video on YouTube of a strikingly similar object hovering over the same mountain range, yet filmed from Tooele, which is on the other side of the mountain range from where I filmed my object. The skeptic in me says it was some sort of extremely bright light they use at Kennecott for mining, but I’m fairly certain it wasn’t touching the mountain and I haven't seen it before in the five years we have lived out here. I would like to send in the video I shot, but I'm not sure how to do that via email.;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941

As this light moved eastward in turned off, it did not dim but turned off. The night before we were driving on the east side of the Salt Lake Valley, in Cottonwood Heights and observed two (2) more lights of the same intensity travelling northbound.  These two lights were travelling one behind the other in a distance of about fives miles apart on the same flight path and altitude. UFO activity in the Salt Lake Valley has been increasing.  The last two weeks have been very interesting, on Sunday July 28 at about 1900 hours (7:00 PM), there was a thunderstorm coming in from the southwest, the ceiling of this storm was about 8,000 ft AGL.  Just above us we observed a black object that had a red light below it.  This object travelled north over Redwood Road from 7000 South and maintained a steady course and flight path.  The winds were blowing about 25 miles an hour from the north.  This was witnessed by 10 people and a few customers that in 7-11.

I noticed a large white light in the sky.  Brighter than the lights on the radio towers.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2020-03-22 22:50:00;~30 minutes;My wife and I were out on our apartment porch, 3rd story so good view of the Western sky. I was mid way through a cigarette and looked out at the sky when I noticed a large white light in the sky.  Brighter than the lights on the radio towers on the neighboring mountain skyline.  The light looked like an incoming 747, but the light stayed in the same spot for 30 min.  Mid way through it began slightly changing color.  From Green to red to blue, and it would dim or brighten as well.  At about 11:10, it vanished from view.  It was in the Western salt lake valley sky, and was definitely not on the mountains.  It appeared to be over Tooele;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941
