12-15 Orbs in the sky just before a small storm;2007-07-17 19:30:00;30 seconds;12-15 Orbs in the sky just before a small storm I was not feeling good, so I had been laying down and listening to a storm coming in over the mountains. I got up and went to my deck door to see the cat and look up at the storm clouds coming in. There was a really dark huge cloud about 75-80 degrees up from my view. I noticed some silvery white orbs things moving around, and at first I thought they were seagulls. As I watched and looked closer there were no wings. There were about 12-15 of them moving around (even thought there was a storm, there was no wind). I looked at the trees to see if they were moving at all and the leaves were not moving. It was a slow moving storm. But the things I saw were moving as if they were floating around dodging each other. Then a few went into the high dark cloud and then the rest did. I watched for 10 more minutes but nothing ever came out. It's like they all disappeared into the cloud. It was strange and I didn't tell my husband who was downstairs painting. I was going to yell for him but he wouldn't have heard me. And I didn't want to leave and miss out on what I was watching.;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941
