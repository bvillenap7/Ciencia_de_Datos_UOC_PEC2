4 red orbs over West Jordan, UT. on Christmas Eve 2011;2011-12-24 20:00:00;5-10 mins;4 red orbs over West Jordan, UT. on Christmas Eve 2011 On the evening of Christmas Eve, 2011, my husband and I, along with our 2 young children, were driving to my parents’ home to celebrate the holiday.  We were about 5 minutes from their home when I noticed a diamond shape of 4 red orbs in the night sky.  They were much farther away than planes or clouds, but much closer than stars.  I pointed the orbs out to my husband and both of us were confused about what we were seeing.  We arrived at my parents’ home, watching the red orbs during the entire drive.  When we reached their driveway, my husband ran inside to get my parents to come outside and look at what we were seeing.  I pulled out my phone to take pictures and got out of the car for a better look.  As I pointed my phone toward the sky I realized I couldn’t see the red orbs on the camera of my phone.  When I looked away from my phone and back at the sky, one of the 4 orbs was gone…there were only 3 left.  I decided to stare at the orbs and watch what they! did, rather than try to take pictures.  As I was staring at the orbs, each one faded out to black – they didn’t move around the sky, they just “turned off,” so to speak.  My husband and parents did not make it outside in time to see them…they had disappeared by that time, in a matter of maybe 2 minutes. I’ve been searching the internet for answers since this happened, but didn’t think to report the occurrence until I heard Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory on 06/20/12, when he discussed this happening more frequently across the country since June of 2011 – and he was describing something very similar to what we saw. Thanks for your time.  I look forward to an explanation…if one ever comes.;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941
Red Horizontal Lights in the Sky;2011-12-25 07:22:00;5 minutes;Red Horizontal Lights in the Sky First orb came across sky in a horizontal direction from the east moving south. Then directly behind came the 2nd one.  As the first light ascended upward a 3rd red light appeared directly behind the 2nd at which point the 2nd moved upward and disappeared then 2 more appeared and were within equal distance from each other moving across the sky in a horiztal pattern  These light moved, stopped, then disappeared into the atmosphere.  The last one came into view this one was hot pinkish kind of orangish red which moved in the same pattern and disappeared.;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941

I look up and I thought I saw a shooting star because I see a big ball with little lights coming from behind it.  So I turn to my husband and I ask him if he can see what I'm seeing. We are stopped and we are just staring at it and it's so big and bright and not moving.  There is no way it could be a plane.  So we are looking at it trying to figure out what it is and then all of a sudden the little lights behind the big ball of fire just turn off one by one and then it just disappears.   We tried to search for what we saw in the sky but we couldnt find it again.  It was so big I want to know if anyone else saw what we saw or can explain it.;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941
Strange fireball like objects in sky, 5 witnesses.;2020-05-09 09:10:00;10 seconds maybe;Strange fireball like objects in sky, 5 witnesses. 2 round, bright white, yellow/orange fire like objects flew in a horizontal line (going away from us) even looked like it went upward and within 7 to 10 seconds was just gone. Disappeared. 5 witnesses.  We saw multiple satellites throughout the evening, but this was nothing compared to anything I've ever seen in my life.  I caught the tail end of the object disappearing in a video, but the video doesn't do it justice.;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941
