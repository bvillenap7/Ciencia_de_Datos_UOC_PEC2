UFO seen in West Jordan, UT;2009-01-27 14:53:00;A few seconds;UFO seen in West Jordan, UT Saw a saucer shaped object very low to the ground, moving west to east. Appeared to have a bluish tint. The object was only in my field of view for a few seconds before moving below trees and buildings. I was wondering if anyone else saw the object and can confirm whether it was actually a UFO or other known object.;40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941
Possible early morning unusual flying object sighting in residental area of Utah.;2009-08-06 02:15:00;10 minutes;Possible early morning unusual flying object sighting in residental area of Utah. My eighteen year old son had been out with friends prior to the sighting.  He doesn't drink or take drugs, but he called me to come visit to show me some pictures, so this is a second hand report.  (I live in Salt Lake City, and he lives 12 miles south of me.)  He explained, the moon was up and he went into the house to get his camera and take picture of the moon with his Pentax Digital SLR 6 MP camera, with his 70-300 telephoto lens.  As he was taking pictures of the moon, he noted a dark object slowly moving and hovering about 30-50 feet in the air toward the northeast, adjacent to an elementary school about an eighth of a mile away.  It was dark, and he could barely see the object, but noted it was slowly moving. He directed his camera toward it an got some picture. This evening, the 7th of August, I finally met with him and he showed me his pictures that he downloaded to his mother's laptop.  The picture quality was poor, but his pictures did appear to show a saucer shaped object, with some sort of a glow or reflection below it.  He said when he saw it, it gave him a 'chill,' and felt like he was dreaming, he could not believe what he was seeing.  It was slightly above the trees, and the pictures did show that it had gained some altitude, but still was hovering, with no sound.  He managed to get several pictures.  Since this is a residental area, except for the large fields around the school, I would estimate that the disk or object, was only about 30 feet or so long.  He went back into the house, and didn't see where the object went, except that it was no longer there.  This may be something else, like a balloon, but even the pictures, as poor as they are, seem to show something unusual.  This may be nothing, but perhaps others saw it also, and perhaps worth reporting it to you.  I served in the military as a pilot. (I got off active duty and became a part time civilian flight instructor and worked for the Fire Department in SLC, which I still do.) One clear early morning about 02:30, in July of 1983, over the starry night skys of Utah, my student and I did witness an unusual craft within 50 feet. I remember the craft or object had a very unusual 'belly.' It was a chilling experience, and never dared report it. My student never flew again!);40.6053799999999;-111.998132352941
