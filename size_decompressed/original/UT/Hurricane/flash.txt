Bright erratically flashing white light in sky above mountains;2016-03-02 20:05:00;15 minutes;Bright erratically flashing white light in sky above mountains At approximately 8:05 PM, my daughters and I were sitting outside looking to the south towards the mountains south of Hurricane.  Above the mountain line, we noticed a rather bright white light, most definitely in the sky, in a seemingly spherical shape, (I made sure of this, as my first reaction was to perceive that it was on top of the mountains), flashing in an erratic way, no rhythm or pattern to the flashing whatsoever like you might expect from a plane or other aircraft.  It would flash several times, then seemed to disappear, then reappear after a few minutes elapsed and do something similar as it had previously done, again with no discernible pattern to the flashing.   We watched this occur on and off for at least 15-20 minutes while we sat there.  We then left the area to go home and did not notice it again.;37.1457;-113.3615
