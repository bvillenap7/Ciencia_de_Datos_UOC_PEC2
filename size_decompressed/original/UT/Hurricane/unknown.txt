Straight line, string of flashing lights East to West in So. Utah.  ((anonymous report));2017-12-09 22:00:00;~2 minutes;Straight line, string of flashing lights East to West in So. Utah. Just after 10:00 PM, I observed a string of 8-10 flashing lights, spaced pretty far apart, which appeared to be lights on commercial jets.  The altitude appeared similar to spotting an airplane at night, but I did not observe any red flashers. The lights traveled east to west, across my line of sight, while I was driving south on 700 East in Hurricane, UT.  They traveled approximately the same speed as a commercial airliner would travel relative to my perspective. The lights appeared to be practically uniform in altitude, travel speed, direction, and distance between each.  This seems uncharacteristic of typical aircraft travel, but I wonder if anyone has any insight as to what this could be or why (if commercial or other type jets) they would travel in this ‘straight-line’ pattern.;37.1457;-113.3615
