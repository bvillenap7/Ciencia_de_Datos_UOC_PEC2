Neon green saucer with white trail falling rapidly at 45 degree angle over mountains west of Hurricane, Utah;2008-02-16 20:20:00;3 seconds;Neon green saucer with white trail falling rapidly at 45 degree angle over mountains west of Hurricane, Utah Saturday, February 16, 2008  At about 8:20pm, as my husband and I were driving thrugh the town of Hurricane, in southwestern Utah, I saw a large bright green saucer-shaped object falling from the sky at a 45 degree angle in the distance, to the West of the town, over the mountains. It was followed by a bright yellow-white streak, like a comet.  My husband was driving and talking on the phone, so although I pointed at it and exclaimed, he did not see it before it dissapeared behind the mountains. It was moving rapidly, as if it were falling out of the sky, and it appeared to actually have a green ring of neon light around the edge like some sort of fair ride gone horribly wrong.  I saw it for 2-3 seconds, perhaps, and all I could think, was what in the HELL is that? I don’t really believe in UFOs, but…what was that??? It was, for me, at least, an unidentified flying object. I kept watching the western horizon for as long as I could, but saw nothing else strange. We stopped for dinner shortly thereafter, and after we ordered, police and fire trucks went by with sirens blazing, and I couldn’t help wondering if they were headed for the UFO crash!;37.1457;-113.3615
