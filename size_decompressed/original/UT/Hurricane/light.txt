A brilliantly green streaking fireball.;1997-08-01 22:30:00;2 secs;A brilliantly green streaking fireball. My wife and I were outside (around 10:30, summertime)talking to her mother when my wife ran back in to get something.  My mother-in-law and I saw a brilliantly-green fireball go through the sky.  Thinking it was a meteor, I shrugged it off.  But after hearing all these stories about green balls of light and UFO's, I thought I would add my own experience.;37.1457;-113.3615

I went outside to take the garbage out and looked straight up and slightly to the north. There were two red lights that were a steady glow (not blinking and without shape other than looking like a star).  They were hovering together.   After a few minutes the one on the right slowly moved North and faded out about 10 seconds after moving, and the one on the left slowly moved South and faded out about 15 seconds after moving from the hovering location.   My wife came out in time to see the one moving South.;37.1457;-113.3615

Then raised straight up, fast, to a very high altitude in the sky and turned bright blue.  I compared height pictures from drones and this was well over the limit of a drone and at least 1,000 feet up, probably more. It was an overcast unusually foggy night for our area.  It remained blue then dropped straight down at a controlled descent in which it turned red again once reaching the same altitude where I first saw it.  It then continued to go down towards the ground until I could not see it. VERY BRIGHT.  I have looked at pictures of Drones.  They are not bright like this and I do not think could have raised elevation straight up and down so fast.  I was sitting on my deck looking South toward's Molly's Nipple, a local landmark.;37.1457;-113.3615
