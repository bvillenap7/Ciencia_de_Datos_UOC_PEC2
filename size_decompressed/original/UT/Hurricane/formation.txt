Long line of twinkling lights. 20+ objects.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible military exercise?  PD));2018-12-08 22:00:00;~15 minutes;Long line of twinkling lights. 20+ objects Noticed the stars twinkling a bit more one evening and stood and watched a second.  Immediatly noticed a loooong line of twinkling white lights moving across the sky.  The size of the stars more or less.  The amount of them were able to stretch as far as i could see in both directions.  Looked like a line of stars moving east to west.  Towards St. George.  Flying super close and low for how many of them there were.  No sound.  Noticed a report from almost exactly a year ago of the same sighting.  What's up with this?  Seems pretty explainable, but cant find any info on it..  Still plenty weird.  Thank you! ((NUFORC Note:  Possible military exercise??

18 UFOs in line w/quite a bit of space between them going N/E.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-03 21:23:00;14 minutes;Hey Everybody We R stargazers and live in Hurricane. Sunday (May 3) we came out @ 9:25 p.m., & began seeing 18 UFOs in line w/quite a bit of space between them going N/E coming from the W!!!!!  Something strange or unique is happening in our Universe! These objects could have been happening before we came out. We've been doing this nightly in the Spring since we moved here. This is another 1st for us! We have seen singular UFOs going E, S, W, blinking ones, ones which shut off & on like a flashlight, ones which all of a sudden it comes on like a dim flashlight & gets brighter & brighter then goes out.... then shows up at another spot in the sky doing the same thing. It gas been very entertaining. Unusual, but entertaining. One night 2 started doing antics like they were playing a game or putting on a show for whoever was watching. That was a 1st. Tonight was another. I mean, it really got us to wondering WHAT IS GOING ON????!!!!!;37.1457;-113.3615
