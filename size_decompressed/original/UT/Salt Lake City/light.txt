Light streaked across the horizon faster than any jet aircraft.;1975-07-01 03:00:00;5 or 6 secs.;Light streaked across the horizon faster than any jet aircraft. I don't know the exact date this happened but it was in 1975. I was touring as a guitar player with a country music act coming back to Nashville from a show in New Mexico. I was riding 'shotgun' and the bass player was driving the bus across the Utah desert. The land was very flat. Approximately 3am I saw a light streak from left to right across the horizon. Through the large bus window it was a spectacular sight. I said nothing and the time. About 10 minutes later the driver said, did you see that? and I said, what was that? He said, I don't know but there ain't no planes that can go that fast. We never talked about it again but I have recounted the story many times over the past 29 years. It was not a shooting star because it was going horizontal. Shooting stars fall. This was not going down it was going left to right across the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The light(white in color)then zig zagged North to South about one mile in legnth over the mountainside just east of the oil refinery. it did so in about 2 seconds.it then went straight up in the sky at an extremely high speed. I was with two friends sitting in a car and they saw it also.we looked at each other in disbelief & said Did you see that?.it was almost as if our attention was drawn to it as soon as it appeared over the refinery.we were only 3-4 miles away from the object so it probably was about the size of a car. it just seemed like a very bright star. I would like to know if anyone else had seen this. I realize it is an old report. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Cylinder of motionless lights in the sky seen over mine;1994-08-04 19:00:00;1 hour;Cylinder of motionless lights in the sky seen over mine Up on the hill by the mine there were several lights in a cylindrical shape.  They were visible after nightfall and remained there motionless.  I saw them from my office window, and I ran outside and notified some residents close by.  I sped home to tell my family so we could go and investigate the matter.  My wife called 911, but they claimed they were something to do with the mine.  I rounded up the kids and we drove out to meet them.  Two of my stubborn daughters would not accept the fact, so me, my wife, and our believing kids began driving over toward the huge lights off in the distance.  By the time we got to the mine, they had disappeared ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness describes self as student.  PD));40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

After 1 minute, they became dimmer, until we could no longer see them. Saw two objects at 2240 hrs. above approximately 5300 South (Central Salt Lake county).  My friend told me to look up at a satellite.  They obviously were not satellites.  They looked like they were at an extremely high altitude.  They both were strobe lights.  They would blink on, go out for approximately 5-6 seconds, blink on again, go out for 5-6 seconds.  They were very bright.  Eventually the lights eminating grew dimmer, we watched them blink dimly 3-4  times, then they vanished.  I would assume that they were headed straight up.  The sky was clear.  They were way brighter than satellites.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Above cloud layer radical course change.;2001-04-28 03:20:00;seven seconds;Above cloud layer radical course change. I had awoken and decided to step out side for a cigarette. I steped out the back door and glanced up at the sky and noticed that the the sky was about 60% overcast with wispy clouds, I turned to look to the north west and all of the sudden I saw a round light about the size of a silver dollar at arms length showing through the clouds, moving from approx 290 degrees heading southeast. As I turned rapidly to follow the path visually, it seemed to alter its course approx 10 degrees ( this was not an arc correction but almost a bent angle) My brain could not accept what my eyes had just seen. There is no way to estimate the altitude or speed of the object, as it was above the cloud layer. I have given this very deep thought for 3 days before attempting to write this down, as the whole episode has been very unsettling for me.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

No other reports from Salt Lake of the event for the time period indicated by the witness.  PD)) Object w/bright flashing colored lights observed over Wasatch Mtns. 6 days in a row. Saturday, August 23, 2003 Sighting: 5:00-5:30 am:  Saw twinkling star in southeast sky over Wasatch Mtns. in Salt Lake City, Utah that was flashing red-orange, blue and white lights.  Got binoculars and saw that it was some sort of object that was very, very bright.  The flashing lights seemed random.  When I squinted, the lights were in line with each other.  At one point, the lights went into an arc, then flattened out again.  Observed it for approx. 2 hours.  At one point, the object seemed to move from side to side.  Then, as the sky was lightening with the impending sunrise, the object started to slowly rise upward until it could not be seen.  6:00 am:  Got husband and he observed object also.  We watched it for another hour.  Sunday, August 24, 2003 Sighting: 5:00 am:  Object not there. 5:20-5:30 am:  Object there, flashing red-orange, blue and white lights.  Again, at sunrise, object slowing began to rise until it could not be seen.  Observed for approx. 1-1/2 hours.  Monday, August 25, 2003 Sighting: 5:30 am:  Object there, flashing red-orange, blue and white lights.  Observed for approx. 1-1/2 hours.  Tuesday, August 26, 2003 Sighting: 5:00 am:  Object in southeast sky just a pinpoint in the sky.  Noticed another object in northeast sky over Wasatch Mtns.  Through the binoculars and with naked eye could see the same flashing colored lights.  This object was not as large as object in southeast sky on previous mornings.  5:30-6:00 am:  Was watching object in northeast sky.  Object in southeast sky seemed closer because it looked bigger.  Within a few seconds as I was watching the northeast object, I looked again at the southeast object and it was directly over the mountains and big and bright again.  The object in the northeast sky started to go upwards and became smaller until it was no longer visible.  The object in the southeast sky was very bright and seemed larger than previous mornings.  This object could still be seen even after the sky had lightened enough for the other stars in the sky to disappear.  Between 6:30-7:00 am, it moved upwards until it was no longer visible.  Wednesday, August 27, 2003: 4:00 am:  Cloud cover, object not visible. 6:00 am:  Cloud cover, object not visible.  Thursday, August 28, 2003: 5:30 am:  Object in southeast sky over Wasatch Mtns. very bright.  Seemed the flashing colored lights were even brighter than before.  Also saw object in northeast sky, smaller and seemed to be moving away. 6:30 am:  Object in southeast sky higher and moving away.  No longer visible at 7:00 am.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

The object stayed stationary in the sky and the lights continued to flash.  The moon rising from behind the mountains was approximately a quarter moon and was very bright, eventually diminishing the otherwise bright red blue and other colors of the object.  The sighting occurred on Wednesday August 8, 2007 and during the sighting a plane was sighted flying in the direction of the objects from the northern sky, which could have been from a local northern Air Force facility.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

It stayed in place for a few seconds -- then moved at an increasing rate North from its location and disappeared.  As the object moved it picked up speed and once it was moving rapidly it left a golden trail of light.

It was moving in ways not within the capability of any aircraft of which I'm aware.  It was making 90 deg. turns, very tight circles, and sometimes came to a complete stop then sped half-way the length of the Salt Lake valley in a couple of secs.  I watched it for approximately 15 mins. At 20:45 I observed the same object again over the valley.  This time it spent most of the 30 mins I saw it over the Salt Lake Intl Airport.  On both occasions today the object looked star-like most of the time, but then it would turn a red color still faint and star-like. I'm a retired Chem. Eng. I worked for Hercules Aerospace for 15 yrs in the Design and Analysis Dept. of Product Engineering.  In the Army I served in Vietnam with the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile).  I'm very familiar with fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. Sincerely,   ((name deleted));40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

The light moved across the sky at about the speed of a plane, but then suddenly moved vertically and the light started to fade and then disappear.  It happened within about 10 seconds.

30+ orange-colored orb-like objects;2012-11-24 19:30:00;~20 minutes;30+ orange-colored orb-like objects Witnessed a minimum of 25-30+ orange-colored objects arise from behind the wasatch mountains. Not sure if the first one I saw was the first in the series.  This continued for about 20 min, 1 after another rising, at some instances 2 or 3 rising at once.  The first one 1 saw I believed to be Betelguese as the color was extremely similar although they seemed much brighter. Even brighter than the star would be on a crystal clear day.  Perhaps as bright as Jupiter would appear as they came from behind the mountains.  They were moving in an imperfect arc from the mountains south-east of the Salt Lake Valley turning west then possibly either toward south or upwards in altitude.  They also caught the attention of at least 5 of my neighbors so I am sure there are many other reports to be heard and seen throughout the southeast valley and hopefully pictures and video.  They were moving about the speed of regular aircraft and even passed at least 2 actual airplanes (as noted by the normal light colors of aircraft).  As they reached about perfectly south of my current location they gradually seemed to fade away from either light direction or distance.  I was able to point out other high flying airplanes at the time.  They seem to be very similar to the orange orbs seen in the June-July series of orange orbs worldwide.  However they are questionable because of the near-airplane speed they seemed to maintain, with the exception of one orb that stopped after raising from behind the mountain as 2 other passed it before it continued on its was.  The distance between the orbs was fairly equal but did vary as just noted, and the arc of the flight path was slightly varied between each orb.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

They were in a triangle formation.  They hung in one spot for a few seconds, so we thought they were helicopters.  The U hospital is in that direction so it seemed logical.  Then the lights began to ascend straight upward.  Two more lights of the same color appeared below the first three.  For a few seconds the five lights glowed together.  We watched in wonder trying to figure this out.   The original three soon ascended more and one-by-one became more faint until they disappeared.

Orange Orbs or Binary Pair + Fake Plane over SLC;2015-04-23 21:00:00;19:00;Orange Orbs or Binary Pair + Fake Plane over SLC Similar lights to the 03/06/15 report. I noticed an orange light hovering over SLC to my south, similar to the ones I saw previously.  I was close to where I saw the previously mentioned formation and so was it.  I decided to let it be, as it wasn't moving, and wasn't really behaving all that interestingly. I came back to my previous line of sight after about 5 minutes and it was still there, and was in the process of being joined by a second, dimmer, orangish light from the southwest, slightly higher than it.  They formed a binary pair for roughly 45 seconds, the new light making a roughly 15 degree rotation in a clockwise northeastern motion around the first.  The new light then proceeded to reverse that motion halfway, and made a course change toward the west.  It lazily drifted out of sight behind a building, while the original continued to hover in it's spot. After roughly a minute, the original made a sudden, similarly slow shift to the west and followed the 2nd's path.  A plane was heading to the east at this point, it appeared to be south of the object.  The orange object produced a small orange flicking light that would blink almost white similarly to the navigation lights of the plane headed against it's course, assuming a fake plane form.  It finally was lost behind the same building as the light that joined it before. These lights appeared to be the same type of orange orb seen on 03/06/15. I will try to capture video the next time I see these orbs, as this is the 2nd time I've seen something that fit this description that has behaved notably.  I've seen similar looking lights multiple times since my previous and convincing encounter.  However, most of the time they just hover for a bit before either disappearing or I am drawn away from watching them.  I saw a similar looking light on 04/03/15 from between some buildings but trees obscured what I was looking at so I didn't report it.  I did however capture some very poor quality video of that sighting that is unfortunately only proof that there was a light in the distance.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

I saw a series of odd lights in the sky above the Salt Lake City airport.;2015-10-09 07:25:00;10 minutes;I saw a series of odd lights in the sky above the Salt Lake City airport. At 7:25 am on Friday, October 9, 2015, while heading north on HWY 215 I began to notice some bright lights in the sky near the airport.  This is not uncommon, but the lights themselves were!  I compared them to what were obviously planes coming and leaving from SLC Airport, and noticed several differences, which lead me to conclude that these might be UFOs. The lights in question were absolutely stationary.  There was not a strong wind at the time, but planes do inch along in the sky, and there were conventional aircraft doing just that.  The navigational lights of the planes were strong and steady, while the unknown lights I was witnessing scintillated like stars.  The radiation of their lights was inconsistent they pulsated rhythmically, and seemed to alternately glow very bright and get larger, and then diminish in luminosity and size to the point of disappearing.  Then they may – or may not – reappear!   These UFOs just hung there in the sky above the airport absolutely still while passenger planes came and went.  I didn’t think to count them at the time, but I now estimate there were between 5-8 such lights positioned at various points in the sky.  Some were as far east as to be visible in front of the mountain range just north of the city, while others were much further west.  The westernmost light was observed to get very low to the horizon in a slow, vertical descent, which made me wonder if it was landing!  There was the main grouping of lights, which formed a line of three in a diagonal. For the most part, they just seemed to hang there in the sky, with the exception of the one that moved down slowly toward the horizon.  I had to park my car at work and go in to start my day, but I did snap four pictures with my old school “dumb phone”, but even with computer enhancement later I can detect no trace of the UFOs. In one photograph, I believe the descending UFO may be visible, but I cannot be certain.  My photos reveal nothing, but even if they had, they would just be pinpoints of light in the sky above an airport so what?  The lights my eyes saw, however, were twinkling like stars, pulsating and changing in brightness.  They were absolutely stationary. I feel fairly certain that I was witness to an early morning display of extraterrestrial craft over Salt Lake City.  Then again, they could have been something sent up by Hill Air Force Base, but they certainly caught my attention because of their odd qualities and behavior.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

At first, I thought it a flock of white birds [geese, swans, etc.] heading north, but then I noticed that there was no formation and they were milling around not heading anywhere in particular.  The brightness of the light or reflection was on then off, all of them doing so at the same time. I continued to observe them when they drifted towards the recently created contrail which was fairly fresh and not dispersed when i noticed they were behind the trail meaning they were above it.  I'm no bird expert but, I don't think birds fly above 30,000 feet.  At the moment that thought entered my mind the entire flock disappeared.   I studied the sky for another 5-10 minutes and saw no trace of them again. I might add, I am 74 years old and have always been skeptical of UFO sightings and have never seen one but, I know what I saw, and this is no April Fools story. ((name deleted)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS--During a telephone call, the witness estimated that he had witnessed at least 70 objects, and perhaps as many at 100.

The intensity of the light(s) was the same as a halogen headlight.  The size of the light(s) was about a quarter inch in diameter. I work at the airport and while sitting in my vehicle, facing east I saw one bright light above and east and to the south of Ensign Peak (elevation 5,417 ft) and at first assumed it was a car at first glance. So, I turned on my spotlight and shined it in that direction.  Flicking it on and off four times.  The light dimmed to an intesity of a car headlight of a distance of approximately 3 miles.  I was able to determine the distance based on Beck Street, which is below Ensign Peak. As I watched the light it disappeared and then reappeared to the north of the peak.  It then turned off. This is not the first occurrence of this or these lights.  I first noticed them in April of 2006. A large bright light, very bright would appear west of the airport, at the north end of the Oquirrh (pronounced oker) Mountains at about an altitude of 10,000 feet.  And fly directly over the airport. This altitude was determined by a FedEx MD-11 that departed and called out his altitude of 10,500 ft.  And fly in the area and was dwarfed in size by the light. These lights travel west to east and fly directly over Ensign Peak at a speed similar to a Cessna 182.  As the light flies over in begins to descend in a straight down path approximately 10-15 miles east of the peak. This is a monthly event. These begin over the Keennecot smokestack and the do not have any identifiable type aircraft lights.  Just a solid white light. I am very familiar with aircraft.  I grew up on or near Air Force bases (father was in the Air Force and I was a member of the Civil Air Patrol.  I currently work law enforcement (27 yrs) at this location.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Bright white light moving really fast.  ((anonymous report));2017-05-26 03:00:00;30 seconds;Bright white light moving really fast I woke up at about 3:00 in the morning was sitting in bed {with the window open to get some fresh air} looking at my tablet when a bright white light in the sky caught my attention and I remember thinking what the hell is that because it was too bright (I would say 3x as bright} to be a plane and it had no other flashing lights on it so I got up and went to the window to get a better look and realized this thing is scooting along pretty well it was hauling ass for a plain. When I first saw the light {my window faces south} it was traveling from the west heading east you know California to New York and as soon as It was almost above me it started heading south-east for about 5 seconds and then turned south heading away from me until it diapered behind some clouds.  It travelled that distance in about 30 seconds.  I realize now that the brightness of the light never changed even when it was traveling away from me and only dimed when it went behind some clouds.  I live near an airport and see planes come and go all the time.  I used to work at that airport and so what I am saying is I think I know planes fairly well.  What I saw was definitely not a commercial airliner. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Daytime Object in Geosynchronous Orbit;2017-09-26 08:30:00;4.5 Hours;Daytime Object in Geosynchronous Orbit On September 26, 2017, at approximately 0830 MST, I was entering the building where I work as a security guard, and I looked up into the sky to the West of my location.  I observed what looked like sunlight reflecting off of a plane very high up, probably at least 100,000 feet altitude.  It was above the wispy cloud layer.  I observed that the  object  that appeared to be reflecting was not moving and just hanging in the  sky. I notified another guard and he also witnessed the object in the sky.  I notified an additional guard, and at least three employees also were notified and observed the object. I checked my star and planet finder app on my phone and there were no stars or planets in that section of the sky.  I attempted to look at the object with binoculars and could see it since it wasn’t moving, but it just appeared to be a white light. The object stayed in the same location in the sky for roughly 30 minutes, then when checked periodically appeared to drift very slowly to the north.  The object was in the sky in fairly geosynchronous orbit for over an hour.  From 0830-0930. I took several photographs of the object with my phone. I notified another guard at a different facility, approximately 10 miles to the Northeast of my facility and asked him if he could see it.  He later advised me that he and at least one other guard at his facility did see the object, but not until 1300.  This guard advised me that he saw the object to the NorthEast of my location, and possibly higher since it was harder to see than the photo I’d sent him.  This guard advised me that he’d seen the object  for about 30 seconds before it  did a “J loop” and shot off to the Southeast.  This guard advised me that when the object left it appeared as if a shooting star or a comet, similar to the objects photographed and video-taped over  Salt Lake City between 09/15/17 and 09/17/17. I had work to do inside the building so I wasn’t able to observe the object after 0930.  When I was next able to check at approximately 1020, I could no longer see the object, apparently because it had moved to the north and east of my location.  This means the object remained in the sky over the valley for 4.5 hours. A little about my background.  I was a police officer for 9 years prior to becoming a security guard.  I also have a military background.  I do consider myself to be a trained observer with a lot of experience.  The other guards who witnessed have varying levels of experience, one has military experience, the others are experienced security officers and also trained observers.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Bright red/orange lights moving in Salt Lake City sky December 17, 2017;2017-12-17 19:20:00;10 minutes;Bright red/orange lights moving in Salt Lake City sky December 17, 2017. At 720pm 12/17/17 I exited my apt building and immediately noticed a brightly glowing red/orange object in the sky due west at an angle of about 45 degrees.  Simultaneously noticed an object to the WNW at an angle of about 30 degrees, identical to the first, but not as bright. First (brighter) object began to move slowly east, the glowing aspect becoming brighter and sparking.   Attempted to take video with my camera, but as I was attempting to film, the object dimmed and faded from view when reaching about 90 degrees of angle (almost straight above my head.)  Sighting lasted no more than 30 seconds.  Later, at aprox. 725pm, noticed an identical object due west in the sky at an angle of 30-40 degrees. Immediately told my friend to come observe it. It was bright, same red/orange glow, as we watched it moved due east slowly for less than a minute but more than 30 seconds, then the light faded rapidly to a very dull glow of the same color, then changed direction from due east to either due west or down from our perspective.  Watched it moving down or due west for aprox. 30 seconds, it's glow barely visible to the eye.  Friend and I stopped attempting to observe any more at 730pm.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

It went behind trees, I got up, my girlfriend and I watched the light move quickly down the sky as it later flashed in and out.  We were in big cottonwood canyon.  As we left the canyon we saw the light above the mountain ridge just sitting stationary.  We watched it for a couple minutes.  Maybe 2 or 3 minutes but, despised to leave. .  It was a little frightening ..;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
5 large balls of light in a diagonal line, not moving in the sky, disappeared one by one.;2020-03-05 21:09:00;10 minutes;5 large balls of light in a diagonal line, not moving in the sky, disappeared one by one. Around 9pm MST I was lying in bed watching TV when an extremely bright light entered the room through the crack in my curtains.  Mind you my lights are off with a bright TV blaring in my face.  This light was bright enough to catch my attention.  I went to the window and saw 5 large balls of light in the sky, extremely bright, over the Oquirrh Mountains.  They had an orange/red color, at times appearing white in a diagonal line. Further up in the sky more towards the North I could see Uranus or Venus according to my star locator, I don’t know which one as they are showing side by side on the app and I live in the city so only one is visible. But the planet has been extremely bright the past few nights, these 5 lights were even brighter and slightly larger in size. It’s common for planes to be seen flying North to South and South to North in this area but these lights were coming from the West and were much brighter than any planes I have seen in the sky.  They also weren’t moving or blinking.  It started with 5 lights in a diagonal line, then the one to the far right disappeared leaving 4 lights.  Then the next one to the far right faded out leaving 3 lights.  These 3 lights stayed for a longer amount of time, again not moving, until all 3 at once faded away.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

The sky was dark and a little cloudy at that time so the orange was noticeable in the distance.  I kept seeing it as I headed west (going to State Street) and wondered why it wasn't moving at all if it was indeed a helicopter. I started to constantly watch it, while keeping an eye on traffic.  It did not move, it was hovering in place.  I don't know what shape the object was but 2 distinct orange lights, not blinking, just constant.  I looked away for about 10 seconds as my view was blocked suddenly.  When I looked again it was gone.  I searched the sky for it and couldn't see it anywhere.  There were other cars on the road.  Not sure if any of them noticed this or not.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
