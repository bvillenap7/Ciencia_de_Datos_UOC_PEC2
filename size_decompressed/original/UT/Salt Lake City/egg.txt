The late nite sighting;1993-06-01 00:00:00;a few seconds;The late nite sighting One nite when I was about 8 years old I woke up and there was circular lights twirling around my room. I got an urge to look out the window and I saw a ufo spinning around in the street. It had lights like the ones in my room. then it just kind of faded. Half asleep I just kind of thought whatever and went to sleep. Then the next day I started to think about what happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Source is anonymous.
