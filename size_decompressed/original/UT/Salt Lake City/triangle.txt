Red flashing lights in triangle formation about 1 mile long.;2016-06-01 19:00:00;10 minutes;Red flashing lights in triangle formation about 1 mile long. Craft was about 1 mile long, with red lights flashing in ordered form with no movement in gap in lights in the whole siting, and a visible edge connecting the lights in person. No airspace reports in the area sighted “above big cottonwood canyon moving north” I’m a nut about airspace records I would have known if it’s the air force base. https://youtu.be/VnOSuW_dcD0 Video of craft through 3rd party and myself.  I’m not sure what month, but I posted it the day I saw it.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
