Lights like string of pearls dance across Utah sky.;2009-08-20 22:25:00;15 seconds;Lights like string of pearls dance across Utah sky. A string of lights waving and dancing across the sky like 8-9 pearls fluttered across the sky in dancing formation.  It came from the Northwest and headed Southwest.   Approximately 2 minutes later a helicopter following the same path went across the sky.  Ten minutes later the helicopter came back over the same path.   It was truly the weirdest thing I had ever seen.  I don't know what it was. ((Name withheld, too embarrassed.))

Unusual formation outside of Salt Lake INT airspace and flight patterns.;2011-01-01 00:55:00;2-3 Minutes;Unusual formation outside of Salt Lake INT airspace and flight patterns. Although there was heavy cloud cover, there were 3 perfectly aligned bright lights forming the right side of a triangle.   A fourth light was to the bottom left of the others, forming the base of the triangle, and had a slight strobe [possibly due to the cloud cover].   The objects were over the eastern skies of Salt Lake City opposite the airspace and flight paths of Salt Lake INT.  They were low and clouds started to set in.   A fifth light seemed to approach from the Davis County area where Hill AFB is located, but the clouds were thick at that point and I could only see the very top of the formation well, by the time we could get a clear view all lights were gone.   I called Fox 13, and several other local stations to see if anyone had witnessed this but no reports were filed.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Two horizontal rows of 4-5 shimmering spots or lights in formation  - it rumbled;2011-02-12 09:00:00;4 - 5 minutes;Two horizontal rows of 4-5 shimmering spots or lights in formation  - it rumbled Saturday 2.12.11 between 9:00 am and 9:15 am  I was returning from the grocery store and had parked in my garage.  I was waiting for my husband because we had both vehicles.  I heard a louder than usual rumble from what I thought were jets, so I stepped out of my garage and looked up at the sky.  We live close to our Intl Airport and within 1-2 miles of our Natl Guard, so jets are common in our part of the city. I looked up but didn’t see anything at first.  Then I caught a glimpse of something shiny.  While I was focusing on the shiny object, several more became evident.  There were 4 -5 shiny/shimmering spots in a horizontal row.  While I was watching 4-5 more appeared, also in a row, but quite a distance from the first row.  In the shape of a rectangle.  You could see the sky between the rows, but the spots were not well defined. The noise sounded like a regular military jet, but much louder.  It reminded me of the rumble of the battle cruiser in the beginning of Star Wars. By the time my husband pulled up they were almost completely out of sight.  He never did see it, but he could hear it in the distance. 1.  The sky was clear  2.  There were two rows of something shiny or shimmering. 3.  It sounded like a rumble from the battle cruiser. 4.  I watched it/them for 4-5 minutes  5. The direction was from West to East  this is unusual because our jets take off from North or South. I suppose it could have been military jets, but I’ve never seen them fly in a row like that.  The shape of each shiny thing (light or reflection) was not well defined.  They didn’t appear to be planes, no wings, no exhaust, no contrails etc..  Just shiny spots.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

I pointed out the window and said, Look way out there... Are those jets?  They literally looked like 6 planes (bright lights) all lined up in order to land at the salt lake airport.   My wife saw them and said, Yea, those look like planes lined up to land somewhere  They look like the handle of a soup ladle.   Well this went on for some 15 minutes before we realized they hadn't moved at all.  Then in between the gaps of the lights, another light would appear the same time as another would disappear.   So it was hard to determine if there were 6 lights lined up or 7 lights.   Every few minutes the shape of the line would move around like they were lights hooked to a string.  Very fascinating and they were not airplanes!!!!!!!    Not sure what to think!

21:30 formation of 5-6 pale objects over SLC.;2014-07-02 23:30:00;5 seconds;21:30 formation of 5-6 pale objects over SLC Formation of 5-6, light grey colored objects in a V-type formation, all going at same speed, from south to north.  No sound of any aircraft.  Moving at a brisk speed, faster than a normal airplane, but not excessive like a jet.  Not reflective or shining in any way.  Was at around 11:30 PM mostly clear sky, partly cloudy.   The objects seemed to be the same color as the clouds, just a bit more dim or not as light.

Intelligent light formation over SLC.;2015-03-06 18:50:00;:10;Intelligent Light Formation over SLC. I was out enjoying some exercise when I noticed a series of large, bright, spherical, red-orange lights floating south over the mountain/valley.  There were 3 in an obvious triangle formation, and a 4th floating West on this side of the mountains.  The triangle slowly grew in size and shifted, increasing the angle until they formed an arch in coordination with the 4th.  As this happened, the lights grew brighter until they were illuminated a golden color. During this process of lining up, there were many planes flying in normal formation southwest toward the airport.  They looked obviously like planes, with landing lights blinking in red and white.  These orbs were MUCH larger, despite being further away at first. As the Arch lengthened and became more equidistant, I observed a 5th light come out from behind the mountain (or from the surface of it?) and join the line.  Not long after the 5th showed up, a 6th appeared, blinking into existence or appearing as though it had come very quickly from the south.  The 5th slowed down and allowed the 6th to join the formation before proceeding.  They all lined up in an arch and proceeded westward at an equidistance.  At one point they were flying in front of a plane at the same altitude and an object flew directly in front, obscuring it.  It disappeared (?) as the craft crossed its path. Each object was perfectly spherical, starting red orange, intensifying to golden yellow as the numbers increased.  Eventually several in formation seemed to begin emitting bright yellow flickers like a bright spot in an welding arc. They looked like they were heading toward Tooele over Chipper Peak.  Line of site was lost with most of them behind a building before I left to go tell others about the event.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
5 orange orbs in diagonal pattern fade to black.;2016-05-15 21:00:00;~5 minutes;5 orange orbs in diagonal pattern fade to black. 4-5 orange orbs, flying in a diagonal formation, ascending to the left (south) seen to the west of SLC over Kennecott Mine/Oquirrh Mtns at dusk.  Orbs seemed to be slow moving/hovering at the time.   I was driving along 215 facing north at the time of the spotting.  I the time I saw them the lights started to fade out eventually to nothing starting with the lowest orb, then the second lowest, before I lost sight of them.

Constant speed lights moving NW on 9/20/16;2016-09-20 20:45:00;10 minutes;Constant speed lights moving NW on 9/20/16 We were at a concert at Red Butte Gardens in SLC.  At about 8:45, my friend pointed out some lights in the sky.  They were about 50.  They were in a loose formation that resembled birds flying in a flock.  They weren't blinking or flashing.  However, they were dimming and brightening at regular intervals.   The color of the lights was a blue-white and made me think of glow in the dark.  The reason I say they weren't blinking or flashing is because the way the lights dimmed and brightened looked like something was alternately blocking and then not blocking the light.  It looked like birds flapping their wings.   The lights moved slowly but at a constant speed.  When a helicopter flew in to the University hospital, it appeared to startle the lights, because the stragglers moved a little faster and the lights in the middle of the formation moved faster and clumped around the lights in the lead.  The lights continued on a straight northwest path until they faded from view.  The whole thing lasted about 10 minutes.  We didnt lose sight of them becuase of the hills behind the concert venue. We lost them because they went beyond the horizon.  They weren't planes: planes do not fly in formation that close and these lights had no blinking red lights.  They weren't birds becuase they were flying too high and this is the same reason they weren't balloons.  Also, they were too many and the sun had set over an hour earlier.  People around us were all trying to get pictures but the distance and low lights made our phone cameras useless.   After the concert, I asked the two officers at the exit if they had seen the lights as well. They both said yes, that neither of them had ever seen that before, and that they didn't know what it was either. We discussed this with our friends as we drove home.  We concluded that it couldn't  be remnants of the Chinese rocket because they weren't falling toward Earth but appeared to be traveling around it and the lights never sh! ot like meteors. Although we don't  believe in UFOs, due to the dearth of information on this phenomenon in local news, I am exploring all possibilites.  I found this site because of the 8/6/16 sighting in Layton of what sounds like the same thing we saw last night.  I wish I had a picture.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

At first I thought it maybe a blue fire work over i215 between 1300th and 7th east.  It was not it was a series of about 15 to twenty blue lights or orbs traveling eastbound.  As I passed under them no sound was heard other than the car.  They where a errie luminescent blue.  They where definitely all at different altitudes.  By the time I got off and flipped around at state St. they where gone.  They all had a depth to the lights as opposed to being just firefly's or aircraft.  The lights did not flicker or change color.
