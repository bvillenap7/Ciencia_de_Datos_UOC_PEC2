3 separate fleets of light in the sky in 1 night.;2021-05-05 21:42:00;~8-10 minutes each;3 separate fleets of light in the sky in 1 night. The first sighting approximately 09:42pm started as my son and myself looked up and saw a slow moving what looked like a fleet of solid bright lights movong from north west to south east that lasted for four minutes and completely stopped. Looked to be not that far apart from each other. The second event that was a matter of minutes after, 09:58pm after was witnessed by my Father,mother, my two sons ages 14 and 18 and my Boyfriend, along with myself moving from west to east. Looked to be coming from a point we couldn't see, moving more quickly than the first and multiplied in a very straight row. What seemed to be atleast 80+ then dissapeared. The third event happen on the complete opposite side of the sky South west direction from us approximately 10:18pm the same night, looked to be very fast moving light that headed straight up into the sky, very clustered together and started separating as they seemed to dissappear.  Bright balls of lights like the other! anomalies and very circular in shape. Clustered together.  The difference to this one was as I said seemed to be moving directly up into the sky.  3 events, completely opposite sides of the sky, and very different formations.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
