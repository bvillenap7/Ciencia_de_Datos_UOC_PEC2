Shocking soft green lights floating in my yard.;1973-07-13 23:00:00;15 min;Shocking soft green lights floating in my yard. I was up late reading in my kitchen. We lived on a secluded acre of land among pine and aspen. My husband had gone to bed. When I got up for a bowl of cereal, & closing the refrigerator door, I looked up and saw 3 green lights in middle of window. Our secluded house only needed tie-back window drapes. I kept looking around the room to see if lights could be a reflection. Our only neighbor’s house, 2 blocks across the street, was dark. I finally decided I couldn’t figure it out and went back to reading. I had barely sat down when I got very curious. I went back to window. Lights still hovering. I put my face up to window. Lights immediately went out. At almost same instant, most horrible sound came from our schnauzer, literally scared to death, trying to bark. He wouldn’t leave throw rug, 3 ft from screen door. He was jumping up and down, looking up at the screen. Les and I decided lights were flying saucer and why lights so small. When waking up, Les asked what terrible sound was, saying it was the most god awful sound he ever heard. We shocked at great difference in intelligence. Saucer flew over flat roof in less than a second.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
seen about 1 mile away.  had blue/white chaser lights at the bottom with a big red light on very bottom;2000-03-06 03:30:00;2 mins;seen about 1 mile away.  had blue/white chaser lights at the bottom with a big red light on very bottom The object flew in a easternly direction from over the Great Salt Lake to where I was working in about 15 to 30 seconds.  Once it got to where it stoped, it stopped suddenly and hoovered in the same spot for about 1 to 1 1/2 mins.  Then it slowly went over the horizon of a hill directly in front of me;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
The ufo appeared to wobble in the sky moving very slowly North bound. I'm not sure how large the craft was. but it was a donut or ring ;2000-07-09 18:00:00;13 mins;The ufo appeared to wobble in the sky moving very slowly North bound.

Two Cloud like Oval objects came out of the Clouds over the Wasatch Mountains, Salt Lake City, Utah!!!;2007-07-13 20:00:00;<2 minutes;Two Cloud like Oval objects came out of the Clouds over the Wasatch Mountains, Salt Lake City, Utah!!! About 8:00 P.M. cooking hamburgers on my porch and my friend noticed something above the Wasatch Mountains and I looked up and could clearly see a Oval Cloud like structure moving around left to right and up and down.  From my vantage point it was slighlty above a whispy thin cloud.  As the object moved around it would change from the same color as the cloud below (which was white) to a dark gray (looked like a storm cloud color), but remained mostly white during the 2 min.  After about a minute and a half of watching this object and trying to make sense of what it might be another object, the same size but slightly grayer color came out of the cloud that the original object was floating over.  They both continued to move left and right and up and down for a few seconds and then they headed South over the Wasatch Mountains behind a tree in my view and I couldn't see them anymore.  All I know is my burgers were burnt and my Wife, my Best Friend and I could not believe what we were seeing and I have spent all night looking for some explaination of waht we had seen.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
OBJECT AT FL200 MASKING IN A CLOUD PACING AIRLINER;2008-04-26 20:45:00;10 minutes;OBJECT AT FL200 MASKING IN A CLOUD PACING AIRLINER Delta Flight SLC-SAN FL200/CLIMB. I WORK FOR AN AIRLINE BUT FLEW AS A PASSENGER ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. FLIGHT PATH OF AIRCRAFT NORTH TO SOUTH. SETTING SUN TO THE RIGHT CLOUD FORMATIONS ON HORIZON LOOKING THIN AND SCATTERED. THE CLOUDS LOOKED THIN AND DARK BLUE AGAINST AN ORANGE SETTING SUN THAT WAS ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT.  NOTHING UNUSUAL, JUST CLOUDS, UNTIL I NOTICED A SMALL HEAT SIGNATURE OR ATMOSPHERICAL DISTORTION BEHIND ONE OF THE CLOUDS.  THIS CLOUD WAS TWICE THE SIZE OF THE PLANE AND SEEMED TO BE GOING SLIGHTLY FASTER BUT PARALLEL TO OUR FLIGHT PATH.  WHATEVER IT WAS, IT HAD NO LIGHTS. IT WAS MOVING BUT SEEMED TO MASK ITSELF AGAINST IT'S SURROUNDINGS. I COULD CLEARLY SEE THAT THERE WAS DIRECTION AND A THIN CIGAR SHAPE OF SOME KIND AMONG THE CLOUD MASKING. OVAL HEAD WITH LONG THIN CLOUD TAIL/ NOT A CON TRAIL, JUST A THIN DARK BLUE CLOUD SURROUNDING THE OBJECT. THIS WAS MOVING IN A BACKDROP OF OTHER THIN DARK BLUE CLOUDS AGAINST THE HORIZON. THIS OBJECT WAS THE CLOSEST CLOUD APPROX 3000 FT TO OUR RIGHT  THIS CLOUD STARTED TO ACTUALLY OUTPACE AND CLIMB SLIGHTLY/ THEN STALLED IT THEN TURNED, BUT NOT LIKE AN AIRCRAFT/...LIKE A LAP SWIMMER AGAISNT A POOL EDGE....IT DID A 180 IN THE OTHER DIRECTION...WAITED FOR OUR PLANE TO GO PAST AND PAST BEHIND US. WHEN THIS THING TURNED LATERALLY, (LEFT,RIGHT) IT DID NOT TURN LIKE A PLANE IT PIVOTED, LIKE IF YOU STOOD ON THE BACK OF A SURF BOARD. IT ACTED LIKE IT WAS IN WATER. IT DID NOT WANT TO BE SEEN, BUT IT WAS MOVING AND CHANGING DIRECTIONS. WHEN I SAW IT DO THE 180 I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING, BUT I FELT FOOLISH.  THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY CLASSIFY AS A PHYSICAL SILVER SAUCER/ IT WAS DIFFERENT...DIFFERENT LAWS OF PHYSICS/ FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS. NO LIGHTS/ CONTROL SURFACES./SEEMED TO HAVE A LOT MORE ATMOSPHERICAL CONTROL THAN ANY PLANE THAT I HAVE SEEN.  IT ALSO TRIED TO BLEND INTO ITS ATMOSPHERICAL BACKROUND SURROUNDINGS LIKE AN OCTUPUS. VERY STRANGE/ BUT IT HAD A OVAL HEAD/ IT HAD DIRECTION/ I ALMOST WANT TO SAY THAT IT WAS WAY TOO ADVANCED TO BE CALLED A MACHINE AS WE KNOW IT. IT IS ALMOST TO HARD TO FIT THIS KIND OF THING IN YOUR BRAIN, BECAUSE IT IS NOT A CONVENTIONAL THINKING OBJECT.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
I work next to the airport and noticed a floating orb bouncing slowly around the airport.  ((NUFORC Note:  High-altitude balloon?  PD));2019-06-20 12:30:00;7 minutes;I work next to the airport and noticed a floating orb bouncing slowly around the airport.  Other planes were flying around it, but I could only see it with polarized sunglasses.   The sun was reflecting off of the metallic top of the craft.  It drifted around and was heading north toward Ogden.   It hovered around the mountains, and then slowly went straight up until I couldn't see it anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  High-altitude balloon?
