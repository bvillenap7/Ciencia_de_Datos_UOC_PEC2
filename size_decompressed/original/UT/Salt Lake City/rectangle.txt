Rectangular Glowing ufo above Salt Lake City enters lightspeed;2018-09-16 23:00:00;10 seconds;Rectangular Glowing ufo above Salt Lake City enters lightspeed Was up neffs canyon near holladay utah 9-16-2018  late at night with friends around 23:00 I noticed something appear in the sky that was maybe 20-45 feet long hard to tell because it was so high up. I could only see the bottom of it but it looked rectangular with the lengths of the aircraft were slightly curved inwards. The bottom was glowing a bright greenish blue but it was changing colors so fast my brain couldn’t even realize that it changed colors if that makes sense. I would be looking at it and it would change colors and before my brain could process the change it would change over and over again. It was in the air for maybe 10 seconds before it left. It started accelerating picked up speed and vanished. I didn’t see it go over the horizon or past my field of view it started going and completely vanished in less than a second.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
