Odd flash of bluish-green light;2007-02-13 22:30:00;1 min;Odd flash of bluish-green light I went outside and sat down for a cigarette around 10:15 p.m.. There was nothing unusual about the night. Low clouds were moving in with the stars still visible through the breaks. I only say this because there was no storm brewing (ie. not lightning). A car was driving by and there was (what appeared) a flash of light which illuminated things around me. I figured it was a reflection and paid it no attention. Then it happened again. At that point I went to the railing to see where the flashes were coming from and just at that moment I saw a bright bluish-green flash to the south of me with a very distinct rod-like center. It was just a single pulse that lasted only a second. I stayed outside for another few minutes hoping to see more, but nothing happened.  I spoke with a meteorologist the next day about the possibility of it being lightning, but he said that under the conditions, it probably wasn’t lightning.  I’m an artist by trade and have always been open minded to alternate possibilities. Plus I have always been prone to witnessing strange things.  I’m attaching a sketch of what this looked like. In reading some of the other posts, it would seem that I’m not the only one who has seen this sort of thing.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
We saw the flash and we expected a loud explotion but there was nothing.;2012-12-11 10:30:00;10 seconds;We saw the flash and we expected a loud explotion but there was nothing. At 10:30 pm mountain time, we saw a flash that lit up the whole sky but it mostly was southwest. It lasted about 7 to 10 seconds we didn't hear any crash or saw any sparks around the area. And at the time the sky was covered with clouds, but now at 10:55 pm the clouds have a wavy pattern in them this was in downtown west valley city 84119.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Bright green flashes.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible power failure, possibly caused by an exploding transformer??  PD));2013-12-19 20:00:00;1 second;About 3 bright green flashes with about 3-5 second spaces between each flash over salt lake city.  Almost resembling lightning in the clouds but its the middle of a snow storm. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible power failure, possibly caused by an exploding transformer??  The witness reported that half the neighborhood where the sighting occurred lost power at about the time the flashes occurred.   PD));40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
