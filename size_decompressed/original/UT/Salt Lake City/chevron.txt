Black bat-shaped object flying low, and slow, and silent, with no lights.;1998-05-20 22:30:00;4 seconds;Black bat shaped object flying low, and slow, and silent, with no lights. I was relaxing in a hot tub with two friends, when I laid my head back and was looking up at the night sky.  I was facing north, as was one of the other guys.  The other friend was facing south.  I noticed the object to my left.  It was mat black, made no sound, and was about the size of a small plane. Flying north at about 30 mph. It was only about 40-50 feet off the deck.  The bottom was visible because the street lamp illuminated it.  It was that close.  I could've hit it with an arrow. I pointed at the thing and said look.  The man next to me saw it, but by the time the other guy turned around to look, it was no longer visible from our position. We decided not to discuss it until we went inside and drew what we saw.  We then compared drawings, and they were the same.  They showed a black boomerang shaped craft with bat like wings.  What struck me the most, was the absolute silence and slow speed.

Moving and silent V-shaped formation of lights in binocular field of view while stargazing;2020-07-12 22:30:00;10-15 seconds;moving and silent V-shaped formation of lights in binocular field of view while stargazing At 10:30 on the night of 7/12/2020, I was in my backyard on the east part of the Salt Lake Valley stargazing with my 10 x 50 binoculars.  I was looking at about 75 to 80 degrees from north, so almost due east and about 45 degrees up from ground level in the east (well above the mountain skyline).  I notice movement across my field of view and quickly moved to find it.  I tracked it to about 130 degrees from north.  At that point I lowered my binoculars to see if I could see it with unaided eyes and could not see it.  I tried to find it again with the binoculars without success.  I estimate the time viewed in the binoculars was 10 â€“ 15 seconds. I immediately had the feeling that I was seeing something unusual.  I had no perspective of how far away it was as I was looking into stars and blackness of night.  It could have been several blocks away or several miles.  I also could not discern the size of what I saw.  I did not even see a solid shape.  It was just the V formation of lights and moving south.  The object fit into approximately 50% of the field of view of the binoculars.  Added to the strangeness of the event was that there was no noise.  It was very silent.  To me, it was a surreal sight and nothing I have remotely seen before.  I am always looking to the night skies and that night gave me a moment I will not forget. The first impression I had upon seeing it was that it resembled the formation of a flock of geese flying In a V formation.  But this was definitely not that.  It was a moving formation of lights that did not vary from formation or direction.  Once I realized I saw something unusual, I went inside to tell my wife who was in bed.  Due to my reaction, she did not question that I had seen what I saw.  I only hope to know of others who may have seen this or something similar.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
