08/16/00 22:42 hrs fireball from south to north salt lake county;2000-08-16 22:42:00;3-5 seconds;08/16/00 22:42 hrs fireball from south to north salt lake county i was traveling west on 4800 so and saw a brilliant white light plumeting through the partially clouded sky. holding my thumb at arms length, the meteor or whatever it was would have been equal to the size of my thumbnail. it streaked in and out of the clouds at a very quick pace, traveling and descending from south to north. it was in what appeared to be one of the popular landing approaches to the salt lake intl airport, however at a steeper descent and a greater speed than even a crashing plane would have achieved. due to the fact that i saw it go in and out of the clouds i feel reasonably sure it crashed somewhere near I215 and I80. the light did disappear before it would have contacted ground. ((NUFORC Note:  The object was witnessed from as far away as Medford, OR, and from multiple points around the Pacific Northwest.  PD));40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Fireball across the top of the wasatch Mountains in Salt Lake City,Utah USA;2002-08-17 01:06:00;6 seconds;Fireball across the top of the wasatch Mountains in Salt Lake City,Utah USA Was standing in my driveway at around 1:00 am, having a smoke, I was looking east towards the wasatch mountains from around 3600 west 4300 south area and slightly above the tops of the mountain peaks coming from the provo area going north almost horizontal along the Mtn tops at about twice the speed of a incoming airliner, the main part of it was about the size of your thumbnail at arms lengh. It looked like a sparkler moving across the sky, with spark trails falling from a short tail and also the main body, it went in & out of a few small clouds and dissappered into the mountains behind the the university of utah. also seen the same thing again 2 nights later in almost the same area about 2 hours earlier,it was big and have never seen anything like it before, was very bright and litt the east part of the sky like a arc weld or a sparkler, a very big sparkler, was not a falling star or meteor, it moved horizontal for to long, the distance of the Salt Lake Valley.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

Just wanted to report UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) sighting over SLC with a extremley bright orange aura. I know the sound of chopp;2011-01-01 00:07:00;~ 5 min;Just wanted to report UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) sighting over SLC with a extremley bright orange aura. I know the sound of choppers and planes. I also know light patterns that these aircraft must use. There were no blinking lights and no green lights in the this sighting. I am a beleiver of outsiders but of course i dont fear them, but it was very interesting seeing this object flying upward (vertically), not horizontally. Afterwards, I saw 3 choppers scattered around the valley make their appearance shortly after my sightinging. Then I saw a superfast object with blinking lights (green and red).... either a jet but im thinking it was a sattelite trying to pickup the trace. I saw it above the northern part of SLC. Not sure if it came from Wasatch Mountains or from the city itself. When I stepped outside seeing it at the beginning of my sighting I would estimate it's altitude from the ground at ~ 5-7k feet up. I noticed it as I headed to the front door! and heard the neighbors making racket of the new year (which i dont mind). I'm 20 years old and I have had 1 OTHER EXPERIENCE where i saw a UFO 30 feet away from me. Take in mind not to associate UFO with aliens but with an unidentified object. Never been so scared and startled in my damn life from the previous experiece. But thats another story... -------- So the facts are: -Very Bright orange aura ~ 5-7k feet above ground when i first saw it -Had no blinking lights at all but a strong solid orange glow! -Was heading upward with slight zig zag movements at one point then went straight up -I never saw a speed increase but it's hard to judge at that distance -I watched it until it left the atmosphere.... I have very good eyes and i watched it until i could not find it in the sky. -3 hellicopters appeared around the valley( I'm from delaware and i know choppers)... They wernt regular news choppers or anything. I'm thinkin military but THAT is just a GUESS -saw a very fast moving object with blinking light ~ 5-10 min afterwards move right past where the object was moving. I beleive this to be a satellite high in the atmosphere scanning. -------- I saw something of great importance but email me back or call me if u find anyone else that shares the same sighting. Pardon my sloppy typing, for I am a lazy typer but i did get my message across.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Bright orange fireballs east of Salt Lake City, UT;2012-06-10 22:20:00;10 minute;Bright orange fireballs east of Salt Lake City, UT My daughter and I witnessed four deep orange fireballs above the eastern side of the Wasatch front mountain range, just east of Salt Lake City, Utah.   The event lasted about 10 minutes.   We spotted them from our balcony, and they seemed to resemble aircraft flairs becuase they appared at a height that is typical to aircraft and drifted downwards.  After observing them drift downwards for a few minutes, two of them faided out of sight.  The other two began to float upwards and hovered for about two minutes, then down again behind the mountains.   Within about one minute, one drifted up from behind the mountains, then hovered, and faded out of sight.   I managed to take about one minute of video of the event.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Large red bright orb releasing a smaller red orb towards the ground.;2014-02-07 20:50:00;1-2 minutes;Large red bright orb releasing a smaller red orb towards the ground. Large solid bright red orb coming down out of the clouds.   Location was east above the mouth of Parleys Canyon and slowly moving further east toward east canyon area.   Another smaller red orb dropped down from the larger one toward the ground a little farther east of the east canyon area. This is my third UFO sighting in the past 4 years around this area.

Orange balls in formation over Salt Lake City Valley.;2014-02-17 21:15:00;1 minute;Orange balls in formation over Salt Lake City valley. 02/17/14 We were coming into the Salt Lake Valley out of Parleys Canyon.  My wife, my 2 kids, and I saw 6 orange balls of light moving in a formation over the valley.   Some broke out of formation, and one ball went lower and released another ball of light slowly toward the ground.  The ball that was released and moving toward the ground, disappeared, but the original 6 remained.   The balls of orange light continued to moved around in formation until they very quickly just disappeared.  They were not planes or helicopters.   I've lived in Utah for 30 years and have NEVER seen anything like this.  It caused me to pull over on a busy highway, at night, to try and get pictures.   My kids were very scared as they knew it was very obvious from the movement of the orange balls that they were not planes or helicopters or anything we've seen.   I was certain of this when I saw the one ball break away and release another dimmer, yet still orange, ball toward the ground.  Please explain to me what I saw.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Flickering orange object moving slowly and steadily like a plane.;2014-07-07 22:40:00;2 minutes;Flickering orange object moving slowly and steadily like a plane It was about 10:40pm on Sunday 7/6/14.  It was moving slowly like a plane that was leaving the Salt Lake airport and heading south.  It also looked like it might be heading east (towards me) as well.  It appeared to be moving, but very slowly.  It was very steady as well. Much like a plane.   It was orange and it flickered.  It would alternately look larger and smaller as the orange glow flickered and it looked just like a fire.   It continued to move slowly and flicker for well over a minute, maybe two minutes.  I watched it for a while and even tried to take pictures and video the resolution is poor on my phone’s camera.   Then, after a while, it just winked “out” (quick but not instantly) and then I could barely see it. It now looked like a tiny white dot like a plane that’s very far away.  The white dot could possibly be a star directly behind where the orange object had been, but it looked like a plane in the distance.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Huge bright orange fire ball appeared, moved southwest, hovered, then disappeared.;2015-02-07 18:20:00;2 minutes;Huge bright orange fire ball appeared, moved southwest, hovered, then disappeared. At dusk 8:20 p.m., 2/7/2015, looking at the State Capitol from northwest Salt Lake, saw a bright orange fire ball moving from east to southwest, at approximately 2,000 feet.  There was no noise and its size was large enough to show it clearly as a fireball. At this same time, a small general aviation airplane was flying west from SLCIA area to southeast at a slightly higher level northeast of the object and about 1 to 2 miles apart. In less than 30 seconds of travel, the fireball appeared to hover approximately above 900 West and about 400 South, then resumed moving south.  Once moving, the fire ball dimmed and then totally disappeared in less than 3 seconds.  The weather was clear, no wind. I have lived near the airport since 1957 for the most part.  Worked in aviation arena for 22 years.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

10 to 15 slow traveling fireballs that faded into darkness. ((NUFORC Note:  Chinese rocket re-entry.  PD));2016-07-27 22:45:00;2 minutes;10 to 15 slow traveling fireballs that faded into darkness My wife and I were driving from west valley eastward and saw a number (10-15) of what appears to be a cluster of burning fireballs in a trailing like pattern in the sky.   What was also strange was the velocity at which they were traveling.  They were moving fairly slow, especially when compared to shooting stars.   They travelled for about 2 minutes from the time we discovered them until the faded or burned out into darkness. ((NUFORC Note:  Chinese rocket re-entry.  PD));40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Orange orb, bright like flickering fire and hovering.;2019-01-09 19:32:00;35 seconds;Orange orb, bright like flickering fire and hovering. Orange orb, BRIGHT like flickering fire.  It hovered in place, then moved very slowly to the north, then stopped and hovered some more and slowly faded out and disappeared over the course of about 30-35 seconds.  I wish I would have had time to shoot it with my DSLR but at night shooting a bright object is almost impossible.  I did shoot video with my phone but it's not very useful.  All I can tell you is that it wasn't an aircraft, meteor, drone or chinese lantern. It was well above the clouds, extremely bright, intelligently controlled and totally silent.  Absolutely bizarre! No doubt a UFO by definition.  The only thing the video I shot on my phone really captures is my amazement and lots of cursing from me.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
