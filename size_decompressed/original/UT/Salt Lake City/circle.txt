The rate of speed was quite fast compared to the jets in the sky and the altitude appeared to be approximately 2000 ft.  I it dissappeard over a small mt. range to the west.  No sound as we were in the car.  The size approximately 4 times the size of a jet at that altitude, although it seemed lower and appeared to be decending slightly.   Duration of sighting was approximately 3-4 seconds.  There was no trail of color or anything behind this object. My husband and I were traveling home from Salt Lake county to Utah county on 12-25-98 as I was watching the incoming planes from the south enroute to Salt Lake city airport I saw a round (Full moon shaped) blueish-green glowing object streak across the top of us headed west south west.  It dissappeared over a small mt. range east of Tooele Army Depot.  The duration was only 3-4 seconds, not sound was heard.  My husband didn't see it as he was driving and watching traffic.  The size appeared to be approx. 4 times that of a jet at that altitude.  It was lower than the clouds and the jets.  It crossed right in front of 1 jet, but lower and seemed to be decending as it went by.  This was the first time I have ever witnessed anything unexplained in the skies.  There seemed to be a aura or haze around this object. There were not blinking lights or other lights on it.  It was just one big glowing sphere.  Thats all.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

Shortly after noticing this, the lights vanished (as if you turned out a light) and was followed by 2 short bursts of light on the ground. On Wednesday March 17, 1999, after leaving Wendover Nevada, we were heading east to Salt Lake City on I-80.  At mile marker 28 all occupants in our vehicle noticed 4 circular shapes with very bright yellow lights.  Shortly after noticing this, the lights quickly dimmed - as is you were to turn out the lights.  Within seconds, two short burts of light appeared on the ground below. I have not been one to firmly believe in UFO's but after seeing these lights, I will not doubt them.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

It was much large;2004-09-30 23:10:00;2 seconds;I was standing on a balcony and was facing north/east.  I saw a circular shape to the upper right side of my vision.  It was much larger than a star, and was a very vidid, white light.  As it got my attention, I focused on it.  Just then, after being stationary for a very brief moment,  it darted from being in the upper right of my vision to the lower left.  Initially I thought I was witnessing a falling star, but I automatically knew that it was much too large.  The speed at which the object left the upper right side of my vision and darted down to the lower left was way to fast to have been any type of aircraft.  Also, the intensity of the light never changed.  It was if it moved from the upper right to the lower left within a second and then just disappeared or blacked out.

Salt Lake City 3 Saucers Of Yellow Blue White Light;2006-08-25 00:47:00;8 Minutes;Salt Lake City 3 Saucers Of Yellow Blue White Light At approx. 12:47 am I was awoken by my Jack Russel Terrier companion, ((name deleted)).  I noticed his barking was not usual for this hour and I feared there was an intruder of my household. I went to investigate the commotion to make sure there was no intruder. After noting that the house was safe, I decided to take my dog out on a walk to help calm him down.  It was just only after walking 500 yards from my house until my dog started to growl toward the sky in a northeastern direction.  It was then that I noticed three white lights flashing brightly in the sky. After my eyes adjusted to the light I realized that I had not seen anything like this before. My dog continued to bark until the three saucers began to display amazing bright light emissions in multiple colors (yellow, blue, white).  The objects continued to hover 300 feet in the air for approx. 4 minutes.  A bright white flash occured next and the objects zoomed back into the night sky, leaving a bright white trail behind them for only 3 seconds. I stood in awe as the objects disappeared back into the midnight sky and my dog quickly became calm again. My location is 8 miles southwest of the junction of highway 80 and interstate 40. Please let me know if anyone else saw this phenomenon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

A second object to the South and East moved laterly a few seconds later and then repeated the same falling and moving to the North at a very fast speed.  Neither object left amy kind of trail.

It was 25 degrees above the horizon and remained in the same place for 6 minutes and then slowly moved down to the north. It stopped and stayed in place for another 3 minutes and then moved. It repeated this pattern for 15 more minutes.  It then went in front of the mountain range so any thought it was a star was dismissed.  It finally moved down again and vanished   Through the binoculars it glowed, emitted energy, changed shapes. It was green, white, yellow, orange.  It constantly changed. Airplanes flew above, below and in front of it.  They were considerably smaller in comparison.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

It moves straight up after hovering and then zips off. There are two instances on this video where it does the same thing. You can see this is right in the flight path of The Salt Lake International Airport. I have been doing some investigating and am finding accounts from people that date back 4 years. These accounts describe the same things we are seeing now.

On our way back we were looking at the moon, and various vapor trail patterns, when my daughter said what star is that?  At first I thought it was a planet because of its round shape.

Salt Lake red orbs may be a recreational drone.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-12 19:15:00;1 minute;Salt Lake red orbs may be a recreational drone. Observed a red orb descend from 3 white lights that maneuvered into a triangle in the western sky of downtown Salt Lake.  The orb made a vertical descent, with an instantaneous stop and 90 change of direction to the north.  Another instant stop and course reversal to the south. It stopped and started dancing.  It then descended vertically into the ground. For one full week, I was certain this encounter was extraterrestrial.  However, exactly one week later, on the 19th of December at dusk, I identified with a $1000 pair of binoculars a recreational drone doing similar maneuvers 1-2 blocks west of my condo.  My condo is on the 5th floor and has over 20 feet of 8 foot floor to ceiling windows facing the west. I am only submitting this report to augment a similar report filed about an incident in Salt Lake on Dec 17.  If the address of that report is anywhere near my location in Salt Lake there is a high probability that someone is flying a drone illegally in the 1100 E. 100 S. area of Salt Lake City.  I believe they may be intentionally trying to simulate unidentified aerial phenomena.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
