Lights over Salt Lake City.;2002-08-01 22:00:00;5 minutes;Lights over Salt Lake City. I work at the Salt Lake City Airport and as I was looking to the west, I noticed a cigar shaped mass floating through the air at approximately blimp speed.  It was almost a transparent/flourescent type of light. It was lined with lights.  The lights weren't very bright, but they went all the way around it. and it changed shape like it stood on it's end and got shorter and fatter as it was turning on its end.  As it flattened out again it got long and skinny, like a cigar. I definitly was not an airplane or a weather balloon.  It was like what you hear on ufo shows.  It made no noise. I have never seen anything like it and it is very hard to describe.  It was witnessed by about 12 people. ((NUFORC Note:  We would welcome reports from the other witnesses.

UTAH UFO HUNTERS REPORT:  I noticed they were flying in unison.;2003-10-05 05:30:00;10 minutes;I noticed they were flying in unison.... I was on my roof at about 5:30am on Sunday, October 5th, looking for what else? A UFO. I was about to head in to go to bed when I saw a red, small light. I pretty much disregarded it right then and there as a plane, cause after about eight years of looking and getting only 1 or 2 UFO's, you can pretty much tell what is a plane and whats not. But I did another quick glance and noticed that there was another red dot about 2 inches behind it. I remember thinking, Wow. That plane is flying really close to that other one... but I noticed that they were flying inunison. Then they both stopped, hovered in the same spot then started moving, south away from me and a very slow rate of speed. After about two minutes of south-ward travel the two lights went vertical, then 2 more lights apeared to the left and right of the previous two, making a lowercase 't' or cross. The four of them togeather spun slowly counter clock-wise, once, then vanished. All in all it only lasted about 10 minutes.

Torpedo-like object in sky near State Street and I-80 in Salt Lake City, Utah;2007-06-13 07:35:00;unknown;Torpedo-like object in sky near State Street and I-80 in Salt Lake City, Utah I was driving westbound on I-80 and noticed an object in the air and low to the ground. It was about 3 miles in front of me on the south of the highway and appeared to be shaped like an aircraft (minus the wings). I could not understand why an aircraft would be so low and so far from the airport, but figured it could be some strange personal aircraft over a residential area.  As I approached (nearing the State Street exit), multiple vehicles on the highway were braking to look at the strange object.  Once within a ½ mile of the object, I knew it was not an aircraft (at least not a “normal” one). It reminded me of a torpedo: silver and shiny with “fins” on one end, but no noticeable “cockpit” areas. (I think there may have been a very skinny “window like” opening on the bottom.)   After this closer inspection, I thought that it could be a skinny blimp or weather balloon, but again, there were no noticeable windows NOR an engine or propellers.  Additionally, there were no flashing lights and it held completely stationary in the sky. There was NO MOVEMENT at all despite tree blowing in the breeze. As I passed it perpendicularly on the highway, I studied the space below the craft for a tether, but saw no indication that it was attached to the ground. As I merged onto I-15 (northbound), I looked in my rearview mirror and was still able to see the craft hovering in what appeared to be the same location. I estimate that the object was about 75-100 feet above the ground and approximately 20-25 feet long.  This was around 7:35 am Mountain on June 13, 2007.  My co-worker said that there was no such object in the sky when she drove the same path approximately 30 minutes later.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
