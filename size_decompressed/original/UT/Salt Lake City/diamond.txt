Vanishing UFOs;2002-04-24 07:30:00;30 seconds;Vanishing UFOs I was looking up at the North mountains on my way to school, the sun wasnt up all the way, and i looked up above the top of the mountain, and saw a Diamond shaped light, that looked like a star. It slowly started moving to the East for a couple hundred feet, then Dissapeared. then at a Completely different Point in the sky, it Reappeared and moved to the east once again. then dissapeared.  Then Reappeared for less than 1 second and Shot downward and made a streak of light in the sky. then vanished behind the mountain.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Greyish Kite looking object over Salt Lake;2008-04-17 17:00:00;1 minute;Greyish Kite looking object over Salt Lake I saw what look like a greyish black kite flying when I pulled out of my work parking lot. As I got past some building I thought that's not a kite. It was far away from me more over the city. When it got closer to the mountains it was almost camoflouged because of the color it was. It was big like a square turned side way to make a diamond shape with 3 crafts smaller behind it. They were kind a bunched up. Anyway it disappeared. When I got on the freeway mabey 15 minutes later, I see it again. Traveling south over the city, Murray,Sandy, then Draper. I didn't want to wreck and I was on the phone telling my husband about it. Anyway just really wierd. I know other people would have seen it. This is the second thing I have seen in a week. I also reported a star that moved during the day last sunday with my family seeing it also, and then later a flashing one.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Black diamond with green, red & white light moving slow and low over city Westbound;2014-04-06 22:45:00;~2 minutes;Black diamond with green, red & white light moving slow and low over city Westbound I got off the freeway on Beck Street coming back into the city. Beck turns into 300 w once you get back into the city.  Of course I hit every red light possible...I got to about 700 s sitting at red light look up to see three lights one white at the peak leading the way (ocassionally flashing), a red (somewhat dim constant) to one side and a green (VERY bright) on the side further south of the craft.   I thought it was strange to see a green light (thought maybe a heli at first) so I started looking closer through my window and it was a large black craft about 150-200 ft in the air moving west bound very slowly and completely silent from my location.   Passed under a star and would have appeared to be invisible if it hadn't been for the lights on the corners.  I pulled into a business parking lot that I think contained an O'riley auto (I'm not local so somewhat unfamiliar) and watched it go out of sight.  Drove to Walmart upper level parking in hopes of catching an! other glimpse, no such luck.   On arrival to my destination in Sugarhouse I noticed helicopters going back and forth out in the airport area. could be a stealth military, I always think that when I think of black aircraft all I know was it was out of the ordinary and definitely made me take a second look.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
