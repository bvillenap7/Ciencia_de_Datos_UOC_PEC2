i saw what i saw, i cant deny what my eyes have seen and unless i can speak to the source will never know the truth.;1995-07-12 04:00:00;20 mins;i saw what i saw, i cant deny what my eyes have seen and unless i can speak to the source will never know the truth. I felt a..feeling,it woke me up and i couldnt go back to sleep the feeling was so strong. climb desolation trail..climb desolation trail !! so i did. it was around 3 am and i drove to the trailhead, packed a flashlight and hiked to the top. i sat there thinking, ok goog excercise but what was i doing here? why did i feel i had to climb the trail? why was the feeling so strong? i took out some fruit i had with and started peeling an orange. the sun was barely rising and the clear morning sky was gaining color and then i saw it !!! at the base of the gully directly below me to the left in a clearing with a few trees it rose like a big..baloon, or should i say the top of a big baloon and then stopped ubove the trees but i now noticed it was not a baloon rather than a ...what can i say, a round, silent, silver or grey or...a saucer shaped object like two saucers, or huge bowl's pressed together on the tops forming a saucer. it was thee, rising slowly,up up to the mountain heights and ubove, silent so i could here the wind. i remembered my camera laying beside me, took pictures and later showed my parents. no windows, no sounds and it stopped high ubove me then accelerated in speed between the mountains towards the sun without tilting. i remember it like yesterday, burned into my mind and i would give almost anything to show someone who belives my story where it was,someone who wouldnt laugh.it was real.its been my seceret all these years. i cant deny what i saw right before my eyes like i could reach out and touch it, it is the truth i wont deny it true blue right down to my shoes. a relative over 100 years ago had a rifle put to him and was told to deny his religious belief, he said what i just said i wont deny it,true blue... and was spared for his conviction. i tell the truth to you as if i also had a gun pointed at me and will never deny what i saw.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

Contrails ran from NE to SW and from NNE to SSW. I was looking at the two formed contrails when a dark red object with black edges appeared. My first thought was a UFO, then I thought it was a kite, but it was too high for that. Then I thought it was a private plane as it seemed to be travelling about that speed towards me. I was listening to hear an engine and when I didn't hear one I turned my head to call inside the house to my wife to come quickly. When she didn't respond (about 4 secs.) I looked back to the area in the sky where I had seen it and it was not there. It was gone. It was like a saucer, or diamond on it's side in shape.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

Saucer, 15' diameter, nw direction, no sound;2000-01-20 13:30:00;10 minutes;Saucer, 15' diameter, nw direction, no sound While walking during lunch a small plane caught my attention, as it was directly above the landing approach for commercial aircraft into SLC international airport. When I focused I noticed an object of the same aproximate mass just NW of the plane. At first glance it appeared to be a balloon but the fact that the small plane had begun to turn back in its direction caused me to take a good look. the plane did not fully turn back and the object got my complete attention. I lost my theory of a balloon when i noticed its steady and deliberate nw trajectory. It did however move very slowly without any sound. It was overcast in SLC today but as it came closer I did notice a slight shadow on the west facing underside. thats when i realized it definitely was something unusual. I watched for aprox 8 minutes, hoping to peek the interest of motorists on 3600 west street. not knowing what to do I continued back to work glancing back several times, the last time I looked back (aprox 10 min into event) the object was gone. I work at a very consertive place and aginst my better judgement I reluctantly told two of the more open minded people what I had seen. Im sure they think Im nuts but I had to share this event! If i was to form an opinion as to the objects purpose/origin it was what I would think an unmanned observation craft might look like, I say this based on the size, shape and demeanor of the craft. Lastly I would sure like to speak to the pilot of that small plane & I hope because of the proximity to SLC Int airport there is a radar record of this event.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

saucer shaped craft, emitting a glow of grey/white light moving up words from the valley floor;2005-10-31 23:52:00;2 seconds;At 11:52 pm, I was on my way to work East bound on State road SR-201 at 8000 west.    A saucer shaped craft, emitting a glow of grey/white light moving up words from the valley floor into the clouds.  The craft was about 5 to 10 miles away in front of me to the east south east and was small pea size at arms length.  The crafts starting point in the valley is unknown.  The craft was out of sight in seconds.  The clouds this night was small and separate from each other.  Temperature was about 47F. and no winds.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
6 UFOs seen over Salt Lake City July 10th, 2009;2009-07-10 23:15:00;1 hour;6 UFOs seen over Salt Lake City July 10th, 2009 July 10th, 2009 Returning from KCF, where we just ate.  We were getting out of the car when I noticed this Orange object to the west.  It was about 10:00pm.  My nephew and I saw this orange star like object silently come from the west.  It moved over the Salt Lake valley. It was at about 4,000 feet off the ground. At first it was moving fairly fast and slow down.  It was slowing turning northward as it traveled. At times it almost stopped as it moved more northward. Once it was over the northern part of Salt Lake City it just disappeared.  We also viewed it with 2 pair of 10x50 Bushnell Binoculars. My Sony Handy Cam would not record it, but I could record some stars that were not even as bright as this object. Perhaps the orange color is not as recordable?  At 11:15pm we seen a UFO over down town S.L.C.. My nephew and I first viewed them with 10x50 binoculars. Also the next door neighbor joined us too, but became so scared she hurried back inside her home. The big Craft hovered for about an hour with 4 other orange , white and multicolored lights moving about also winking out totally at times. We viewed these objects with 10x50 binoculars and with my telescope. I put a high power lens in the telescope and the picture attached is what it kind of looked like. With that 6mm eye piece I can see the rings of Saturn with it, even on a poor visibility night…… so we got a great view of it! It was awesome!;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
((HOAX??))  Abduction and Oval Ufo sighting a few weeks before.  The aliens were red headed Lyrans.;2014-03-06 04:00:00;5 hours;Abduction and Oval Ufo sighting a few weeks before.  The aliens were red headed Lyrans About 3-4 weeks ago above the wasatch mountains there was a oval white ship hovering about the mountains along the way of my walk. About a few weeks later Red headed Lyrans come to me in dream form and I was pulled through my ceiling, which has concrete on the roof, and I dont remember being pulled through the air. As I come aboard the ship, some of the aliens were curly haired strawberry red heads and some were tall some were short. The key boards were all black with a big mouse looking orb on the thing where they control the ship. I asked them how they operated it and they bluntly refused to tell me how the ship worked. After that I saw an outside view of the ship and they told me they needed me for something while I remember them taking me to north dakota and seeing piles and piles of snow on the outside. When they shot up in the air the ship went from 100 feet above the ground to 40,000 feet about in a matter of a second. When I was also in the craft while abducted I asked them who the greys were and they told me a word which they said, They are your tan.  I looked up the root word and it means friend. They said that The Greys are humans friend. The abduction/dream lasted for about 5 hours.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Dark UFO moving slowly northbound on I-15;2016-08-11 21:16:00;5 minutes;Dark UFO moving slowly northbound on I-15 Driving north on I-15, looking northwest, 3 of us saw what first looked like a strange disk shaped cloud, dark grey to black in color.  The sun was low in the sky (just past golden hour) joking about it being a ufo, driving closer it appeared to have form, and we realized it wasn't behaving like any cloud, it was moving eastward slowly until it started to split into 3 forms and turned moving due north.  It was perhaps 3 objects in formation from the beginning. I say this because they remained horizontal to each other, spaced equally apart.    They stayed in this formation as it moved away (northbound, west of I-15) in the distance until it was too far and dark to see anymore.  The smaller objects had a similar form as it first appeared while larger.  We estimate size (first formation size) to be about 500-600 ft across due to position in sky and distance.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
