At first I thought  it might by a plane, although  I have never seen one so bright. I watched it for a few minutes and then went to get my camera. I am disabled so I walk very slow. It probably took at least 4 minutes to get my camera. I took pictures over a 12 minute period as you can tell by putting your mouse over the pictures. I leaned against a tree to try to keep the pictures from blurring. I would say it seemed to be in the same area for long time, at least 20 minutes and probably  longer. The only thing I thought it might be is the space shuttle, although  I donâ€™t think it could be that low in the sky. I  have never seen anything that seemed to be in the same place for  long. I was watching a program on the travel channel that reminded me of that night. Maybe these will be of some interest to you. I saw this on march 13 2001 just after 7 pm in Salt Lake City Utah. Thanks ((name deleted));40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
2 people saw a slow moving very large darkness with faint light reflecting off its leading edge.;2002-10-30 21:30:00;00:22;2 people saw a slow moving very large darkness with faint light reflecting off its leading edge. My girlfriend from behind me gasped, saying What the hell is that? I looked up without seeing her pointing or anything and saw something definitely designed not to be seen or heard moving slowly over the eastern mountains in a southerly direction then turning gradually to the west.  Slow moving.  As it passed between me and the stars (very clear night) I noted that it obscured stars from view.  Spook-Alley beacons were aiming directly in its direction and didn't reach high enough to illuminate it at all.  It appeared as light reflected off its forward edge (but an edge designed not to reflect light). It may have come to a point or been a gigantic disc. If it was travelling at a high enough altitude to be out of the reach of the searchlights it was massive.  It may have not been affected as searchlights shined on it and been at a lower altitude.

UTAH UFO HUNTERS REPORT:  I had a strange feeling the object was following me.;2003-10-23 12:30:00;4-6 seconds;I had a strange feeling the object was following me. I was heading east towards the mountains on the Dugway testing range road when I saw an object (it looked like a Disintegrating meteor heading from north to south traveling really fast at first then slow horizontally in the sky until it stopped and stayed in the same place for a while. I pulled over as an old truck sped fast around from behind me and to the east (mountains). On the way home from that point I had a strange feeling the object was following me because here and there I would see a light in the sky that would look very similar. (the object was about 3-5 miles away and between Dugway chemical depot and rush valley.)

My parents house is over 10 miles to her house so the flash must have lit the whole sky!;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Faint glowing large object streaks the night sky over Salt Lake City only leaving a trail;2010-07-21 23:37:00;4 seconds;Faint glowing large object streaks the night sky over Salt Lake City only leaving a trail As I was driving south into SLC something in the sky caught my eye. I looked up and there was an object moving extremely fast. I live by Hill AFB and this object moved 5x faster than any F16 F18 F22 I have ever seen. This object wasn't very distinct. Once focused on the object I noticed it was slightly glowing but I only really saw it because the moon was so bright. It was traveling north to south and only through the moonlight did i notice it also had a tail. To be honest it moved just like a meteor but it was so close i could actually see the object. It was bulky in shape almost cubed and left a trail but not a light trail like a meteor it was almost like a smoke trail like a plane would leave but it disappeared very quickly. It looked more like it was just moving so fast it was displacing the atmosphere around it. I would have said it was a meteor but I saw that low flying meteor that passed through the atmosphere back in late '09 and it lit up the entire! sky so I don't believe that this was the same case. This was a big chunk of something that darted across the sky almost invisible. I don't know if this site checks air traffic in the area of these occurrences but I would just like to know what it was thanks.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

It was not a stormy night and there were no other occurances this evening.   The explosion sounded like a gun shot or maybe a crash.  This occured at 01:59:39 Near the University Of Utah.   My collegue and I reviewed our buildings security footage and were able to catch the flash and the time but not the origin.  Our thoughts are that it might have been a meteor and we plan to investigate the location of where we think the sound came from which was near the mouth of Emigration Canyon.

Explosion, or craft, that looked like torches.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible nighttime parachute jump??  PD));2017-09-16 19:50:00;10 minutes;Explosion, or crafts that looked like torches. At first looked like a comet or meteor breaking apart, very torch like falling slowly toward the north and east (over the U of U from my point of view). Looked like they were burning, and falling. They slowly spread into a diamond formation, continuing to head down, occasionally disappearing behind clouds.  At one point some of them changed direction back toward the west, still heading downward.  Sort of like a falling ember, but much larger and farther away. Lost site of the fourth one behind the trees, then they started blinking out.  The last one I saw change directions again behind the trees. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible nighttime parachute jump??

Object unusual altitude one light observed.  Traveling in a pattern not conducive to commercial or private chat Noir helicopter.;2020-07-07 22:56:00;~3 minutes;Object unusual altitude one light observed.  Traveling in a pattern not conducive to commercial or private chat Noir helicopter. I am an empath.  Also a medium.  This is approximately in my perhaps 5th or 6th sighting.  I was outside on the phone with one of my friends.  I was prompted to look up. There was an object moving at a far greater altitude than normal .   not have the lights the lighting or shape of airplane commercial nor privates nor helicopter . I observed a single light this time.  It appeared to be moving from the south 2 North a little eastbound.  It made continued steady progress like that of a falling star but not at the Rate or speed of it. When it was directly overhead its load paused.  Then climb Tire and I lost track of it.  The other times I've seen them reminded me of when they like a mosquito fly or bee buzzing around the erratic path they take.  The speed.  Was much greater of course.  I've seen more triangular-shaped with multiple light.  There is an spell singular and multiple spacecraft  Are UFOs. I believe in one the lights were blinking or flashing.  I didn't look up! until it was close to me.  As I said it appeared to be traveling at a reasonable rates and then almost paused about me.  I was just wondering if there was something else in the area that night like a military are saddle I don't know if you can see Satellites with endearing distance.  This was higher than anything I've ever seen.  When I witnessed the UFOs before they moved 8n closer.  I got the impression there were to possibly more objects in the sky.  One was hidden behind another.  There will be another sighting soon. Possibly a visitation boots-on-the-ground Landing.  That's what I've seen in my vision anyway.  The same way I saw the theft from the labs in Wuhan.  My premonitions happen fairly quickly.  So I would State another one that's sure. Possibly the boots on the ground.  Where I live.  We have a lot of military installations out here like Hill Air Force Base.  So at first I wondered if it might perhaps be something like that.  Except for the altitude didn't make sense.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
