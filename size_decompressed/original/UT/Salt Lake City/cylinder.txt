Something in the Sky over Sugarhouse Park, Salt Lake City - Utah;1980-05-01 12:00:00;About an hour;Something in the Sky over Sugarhouse Park, Salt Lake City - Utah I remember looking up into a very nice clear day with no clouds - I was looking for clouds as my Grandfather had said there was not one in the sky - which we could see. As I looked up around I noticed a spinning cylinder right above us - though very high. I remember thinking to myself must be a satellite - as I was ignorant of the subject.  I looked at it for sometime off and on as I ate with my family. I pointed it out to my mother and grandparents and they also could see it - but they where more interested in me finishing my meal so I could go play. It was not alarming to us as we did not think about UFOs or such things â€“ just figured it was suppose to be there. I remember seeing sun light reflect off (flashing like) a more silver-ish side as it rotated above us. The other half was a blue hue. Again, as I got older and re-thinking about how odd it was this satellite was so low that I could see it and it was not moving, just spinning above us.  I learned that a satellite would not be stationary at the altitude I was seeing this object at. It was hovering and rotating on its axis at about once every two or three seconds.  Very, very odd - still haunts me today as for my lack of understanding and realizing several years later that was not normal.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
3 orange glowing cylindrical objects below the clouds;2019-01-24 20:45:00;5 minutes;3 orange glowing cylindrical objects below the clouds On my way back from the store, I looked into the night sky, the clouds were an orange hue. At a 45 degree angle to the north, I noticed three thick, cylindrical, dark orange glowing lights flying in a triangle with quite a bit of distance between them.   I thought it was a convoy of helicopters until they flew together quickly then split into a L-shape, two of the glowing lights headed high into the east and were out of sight, the last glowing light went higher into the night sky headed north and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sincere and serious-minded.  We suspect that she is an excellent, and highly reliable, witness.  PD));40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
