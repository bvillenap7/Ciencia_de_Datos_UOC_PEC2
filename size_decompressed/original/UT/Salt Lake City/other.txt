I was looking in the air, and notices three small white circles arranged in a neat triangle. It looked odd, but I assumed they were balloons. However, just as I was about to ignore it, the three objects faded away in unison, and reappeared in the same fashion in a nearby area in the sky. The objects continued this shifting in apparently random orders every six or seven seconds. It never seemed to stop, and I left as the sun began to set. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

After closer observation we realized it had a definate shape, ability to change direction and altitude at will, and was indescribable in any common description. My wife and I were sitting in the hot tub on the roof of our 26 floor condominium building in downtown Salt Lake City.  From this location there is a complete view of the Salt Lake valley.  I had noticed a small fire burning several miles to the west of the city.   Shortly thereafter, as I was looking to the south from our location,  I noticed what appeared to be a small cloud of smoke floating from west to east and about 3 blocks to the south at the same level as our position.  Initially I assumed it to be from the fire I had noticed earlier, until I realize the wind direction was the opposite of the direction of travel of what I assumed was smoke and also the fire was too small and too distant for the smoke to remain together for that distance.  I immediately directed my wifes attention to what I was witnessing, and we watched in total amazement for several minutes as the object navigated within an approximate 2 mile area.  The only way to describe the object is through relating it to other known objects.  When we first started observing it, the object seemed to be just an undulating mass, but as we watched it, we realized that it did in fact have a shape that remained consistent throughout the entire episode.  This shape and movement would relate perfectly to movies we have seen of large stingrays as they move through the water with their outstretched fins waving, similar to birds wings in slow motion  The strangest part of the episode was that the object was almost entirely invisible, and the only recognition that it was even there was that it distorted everything behind it so that you could in fact make out the shape by observing these distortions.  Again, to relate it to something familiar, it resembled the creature in the movie The Predator.  As we watched the object, it navigated in a very definate path, changing directions at will and traveling first from west to east, then to the south, then back to the west, then lowering in altitude close to a baseball stadium about a mile from our location,! then hovering at that spot for several minutes, then again rising in altitude and moving back to the west at a phenomonal speed until it totally disappeared.  This was all done with total disregard to wind speed or direction, which ruled out the cloud theory or the fact that it could be caused by a pocket of hot air which could have caused a mirage affect.  After it's disappearance, my wife and I remained stunned for several minutes just watching for it's return.  We then tryed to figure out what we had seen, since neither of us had said anything while we were watching it. Our descriptions to eachother afterwards confirmed that we had both seen the exact same phenomena and that it was nothing we had ever witnessed before or probably would ever again.  One of the things that we did realize was that it was our location that had made it possible to see it in the first place.  Had someone on the ground tryed to see it they  would not have been able to do so since it was only the distortions of the background objects that even made it possible to distinguish, and looking up against a blue sky would have made that impossible.  Whatever it was, I know it was not a heat distortion, or a cloud and that it was definately under some sort of guidance or control.  This event was very special to me since I have always been a believer in the possibility of many activities beyond our comprehension, but my wife has always thought that to be a rather ludicrous idea, until this event, which she still cannot explain or justify.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

I arrived at the Institute of Religion on 1535 South Edison in Salt Lake City at 11:14 pm and was getting out of my car when I seen an object through the sun roof.  I got out of the car and looked up to see a Boomerang Shaped Object moving from the Northwest to the Southeast. I watched as it moved about a mile and sliped out of site. The Object did not have any lights on it but reflected light from the ground and did not make a sound. ((NUFORC Note:  One of seven reported sightings from same source.

Black Manta Ray shaped U.F.O. seen flying over the 1300 light rail staion in Salt Lake City, Utah during the winter of 2007.;2007-03-01 06:00:00;1 minute;Black Manta Ray shaped U.F.O. seen flying over the 1300 light rail staion in Salt Lake City, Utah, during the winter of 2007. I was walking toward the 1300 south light rail station.  I took the light rail to work that morning.  At 6:00 AM, I saw a black manta ray looking ship floating about 10 feet above the light rail track.  I was close enough to hit it with a rock.  It was silent and very intimidating.  I felt as though someone inside it was watching me as it flew down the tracks.  I walked to within twenty feet of it.  It flew down the tracks toward the downtown Salt Lake sky scrapers.  I watched it fly off and proceeded to walk to the station to ride the light rail to work.  I had to turn away from the ship to walk to the station and that is what I did. The ship was shaped like a black manta ray.  It was steam lined in a aerodynamic and hydrodynamic way.  I got the feeling that it flew under water with as much ease as it flew in the air.  It flew effortlessly and with no sound.  I know this sounds strange but I felt as though it was alive.  I could even feel it's mood.  And I felt as though someone inside of it was watching me.  The strangest thing I have ever seen and felt in my entire life. I am telling the truth and am positive I could pass a lie detector test.  I don't know if it was alien or military.  However, whatever it was,  I could not identify it.  ((initial deleted))  Salt Lake City, Utah. 2007.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
two aircraft flying in formation low to the ground, in the city, of an unknown aircraft design, with no noise.;2009-06-19 09:15:00;one minute;two aircraft flying in formation low to the ground, in the city, of an unknown aircraft design, with no noise. Friday, June 19, 2009, 9:15 am I was driving, 60 miles per hour, to work on Interstate 80 heading west just South of Salt Lake City, from about the 700 East Exit to the State Street Exit, approximately one mile in distance I viewed the following.   In the distance, some five miles away, an airliner that had taken off from the Salt Lake International Airport heading due south and slowly gaining altitude when I noticed two aircraft flying parallel to the airliner but most likely closer to my position.    The two craft, in formation, then made a right 90 degree turn and came directly east towards my position and then made another hard 90 degree turn and flying due north over me at maybe 200 to 400 feet, at about the State Street Exit. The time I had to view these craft including paying attention to traffic and observing was at least one minute. The craft appeared to behave aerodynamically.   They seemed to cover quite a bit of territory in a short time, at least four to six miles.  When they made their turn just before passing over me, they must have been near a stall speed to make such a sharp turn and for me to view them in as much detail. I heard no engines, prop or jet.   The Craft were approximately the same size as a military fighter plane, or smaller.   My window was down, but I think I would have heard something over the noise of the traffic.   I-80 is under construction and the max speed is 60 mph, and the traffic was light. The odd appearance of these craft is the reason for this report.  The fuselage was long and cylindrical, coming to a point at the front and rear in the usual aerodynamic configuration.   The wings began about mid point of the length fuselage shaft.    The appearance of the wing configuration, in plan view, is that of a bird with wings spread out.   The leading edge of wing seemed to sweep forward and then back again at the end of the wing, with the rear of the wing flaring back toward the fuselage.   The color was a white or silvery white.    I couldn’t remember seeing any secondary wing or tail stabilizer in the rear.    There was no forward secondary wing in front of the shaft as one would expect of so long of a forward portion of the fuselage.    No cockpit canopy could be seen. Upon reviewing what I had just seen, the wings appeared to have a wide black line that followed the contour of perimeter of the wing, and set back from the edge of the wing. I latter called the Salt lake City Airport and talked to the air tower representative and described what I had seen, At first he stated that these craft could be from any number of different government agencies, he then stated that they were most likely VFR craft used in mosquito abatement.   I said they had pretty sophisticated equipment for crop dusting. I will send a copy of a sketch that I had drawn.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

Another day, another sighting.;2013-09-16 21:00:00;1 hour;Another day, another sighting. Every night, myself and friends have witnessed a bright light in the western sky.  This light is bright, pulsating, emits energy, changes shapes. It hovers from 2 - 15minutes at a time then disappears , reappears.  Sometimes it takes off very quickly. It disappears when planes approach.  Every night it is something different. Three nights ago, there was an object much higher in the sky. It had blue, red and white, rotating lights. It hung in the sky for 30 minutes.  (I can say I got a very negative feeling as I watched this. It actually scared me and I have never felt with the object I see every night) Suddenly, lower in the sky, the large , bright object appeared.  Then moved to the north, disappeared and reappeared I have tried to talk to as many people as I can to educate myself.  I have tried to do everything I can to get someone to help me figure this out . I keep posting this on FB and everyday more and more people say they have seen it for months. NO one files reports. All of these things have been viewed with binoculars.  Mu pictures are on a tripod. The video will be sent as soon as I get it converted .;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
