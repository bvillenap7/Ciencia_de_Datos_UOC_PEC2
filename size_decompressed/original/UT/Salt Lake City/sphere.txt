Your story about the stationary weather balloons was identical to my sighting in May 1980.  I wrote to you about it a while ago. The silver ball was so high it was all I could do to stay focused on it which I did for about 20 minutes . There were 2 similar sightings in Australia and Brazil shortly after.  The Australia sighting was off the coast and remained there and was gone at dawn . The Brazilian sighting was different in that the object was moving very fast from right to left on the screen at tree top level with no sound. What I saw appeared from my perspective to be over the eastern shore of the Great Salt Lake which would also place it near the airport .;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Stationary silver ball very high in daytime May 1980 observed approximately 45 minutes.;1980-05-20 12:30:00;45 min;Stationary silver ball very high in daytime May 1980 observed approximately 45 minutes. One clear  day in May 1980 I saw a stationary silver ball so high in the sky as to be practically invisible. I found it totally by accident while on a lunch break in a park called `Sugarhouse Park`. I was lying on my back gazing at the contrails in the otherwise clear sky. I spotted it and couldn`t believe what I was seeing. I lie there 45 minutes or so before I had to go and tell somebody and of course I could not find it again. Later on TV news was reported two similar sightings. One in Brazil, and one in Australia. The one in Brazil was moving at a high rate of speed at tree-top level with no sound and lasted about 90 seconds. The Australian sighting was out over the ocean off of a beach. It was stationary and was video taped until dark. The next morning it was gone. This all happened in a time of about two days.Absolute truth. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A solid Spherical object appears over one of the building and the Westminster College in Salt Lake City.;1998-09-15 04:00:00;2,3 sec;A solid Spherical object appears over one of the building and the Westminster College in Salt Lake City. Tuesday morning in Salt Lake City, at the Westminster College. It was 4:00 am and I just stepped out the back door of the Bamberger building with a bag of trash and a cup of coffee. I put the trash in a trash can and stopped to drink some coffee. I was having problems with the batteries in my laser pointer that I  use for my work. I was pointing it towards jupiter in the western sky. I only had it on for about 1 to 2 minutes when in a blink of an eye a solid spherical object appeared over the Gore building about 150' to 200' feet off the ground. It startled me so I turned off the laser pointer and watched it for the time it set there, (about 2 to 3 sec.) it did not bob or weave, it sat as if it was locked in place. then in an instant it was moving about 60 mph across the top of the building in front of me then turning to move past me on my right, almost strait over my head, it looked like it was only 6o feet in the air as it passed over, the size wasabout 2' feet wide at arms length ) it did not make a bit of sound at all or even make a breeze, I could see the bottom of the object and up the side, the top was black reflecting the night sky, a band around the lower middle reflecting the city lights and it had a reddish glowing tint on the bottom. the texture on the bottom was like it had small pits and pings, very much crater like. As it passed over I ran under it to see it out the other side of the tree cover, but before I could clear the trees I heard a bang sound, when I got into the clearing the object was gone. ( I am not sure if the sound was related to the object or not.) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded to be a credible witness.

UPDATE: Sept 15,98 sighting, MUFON report;1998-09-15 04:00:00;2 to 3 sec;UPDATE: Sept 15,98 sighting, MUFON report UPDATE: ---<( MUOFN Summery Report By Guy Richardson MUFON Investigator.)>---  I met with Mr. ((name deleted)), at his home Saturday, October 21,2000 to take his statement regarding the UFO sighting he witnessed on July 6,2000, the details of which are included in a separate report. During the course of the interview Mr.((deleted)) recounted another sighting witnessed on 15 September 98 that had not been submitted to MUFON until now. While the reconstruction of a UFO sighting that occurred two years ago poses obvious problems for the investigator, it should be noted that the witness made a written account of the incident within days of the its occurrence. The information contained in this report corroborates remarkably well with the account of two years ago. Mr.((name deleted)) web site is: http://rockc.tripod.com.  Subsequent to our first meeting, Mr. Rock accompanied me to the Westminster campus where we reviewed the sighting on location and made measurements to establish the distance to the UFO from the witness when first and last seen during the course of the sighting. There are ample points of geographic reference on the campus to establish, with a high degree of confidence, thedistance to the object however, the estimation of the apperent size of the object is made with leddcertainty. The narrative that follows reflects calculations of size and distance based on these measurements that, while stated in exact figures, should be regarded as the best approximations obtainable without the aid of special equipment.  At 4:00AM on the morning of September 15 1998, Mr. Rock was working at Westminster College located at 1840 South, 1300 East, in Salt Lake City. He had stepped outside to throw away trash and sip some coffee. The witness stated that the night was cool, around 65 degrees visibility was clear without any clouds. While facing west, sipping coffee, he fired his laser pointer, which is used at work to identify areas that require cleaning, into the sky in the general direction of Jupiter+.  Within a minute or two of firing the laser, a gray, spherical object, calculated to be 70 feet in diameter*, appeared, in the western sky, hovering over an adjacent building at a distance of 260 feet from the witness at an altitude of 40 feet above the ground. The appearance of the object was sudden and was not preceded by movement from some other location. It simply appeared.  Upon seeing the object, the witness turned off the laser pointer. Mr.Rock stated that at that moment he was quite awed by what he was seeing and doesn't recall feeling or thinking much in the ensuing moment. The object sat completely motionless for 2 to 3 seconds then moved north toward the witness at a speed estimated to be 60 mph**. Witness stated that the object had no apparent period of acceleration i.e. the object was motionless one instant and then moving at 60 mph the next, without any incremental increase in speed. He watched the object pass over him, headong northeast when lost from view as the object passed behind a building. The moment before the sphere moved out of view was when it was in closest proximity to the witness: 60 feet away at an altitude of 40 feet, with a calculated diameter of 58 feet*. During these last few moments, the witness observed the underside of the sphere, which he described as Reddish, pinkish with pits and pings and very much crater-like.  He added that, apart from the bottom, the object was smooth,gray and featureless.  Witness also said he felt as if the object was aware of him.  As the object passed over the witness it went behind some trees and continued east behind a building.  The witness pursued the object on foot but before he could clear the tree cover he heard a bang and when he came into a clearing the object was nowhere to be seen. Witness stated that he then returned to work and was very excited but was not able to relate the story to any of his co-workers because he doesn't speak much Spanish and they do not speak English.  Witness said that he was not able to sleep more than a couple of hours during the next two days because he was so excited and impressed with what he had seen.  After a couple days the witness contacted Peter Davenport, at the National UFO Reporting Center, who was given permission to tape the conversation.  That conver- sation was aired about a week later on the Art Bell's Coast to Coast radio program and should be made available when archive conversation, at that web site, is completed.  Witness stated that during the entire event no sound was heard coming from the sphere nor was there any perceptible emission of any kind.  There was no disturbance to the immediate surroundings caused by the object.  Astronomical data for the date and time of sighting:  Moon: 18 degrees altitude 84 degrees azimuth, 16% waning crescent  Jupiter: 23 degrees altitude 241 degrees azimuth   +Data confirm the witness's statement regarding Jupiter's position in the sky.  The moon, while low in the sky, would have been behind the witness in the east.  *Calculated diameter of the object is made for when the object was first and last seen.  There is a difference of 12 feet between the two perspectives that probably reflect an uncertainty of the actual size rather than to suggest the object changed its size.  **Based on a total distance of 310 feet traveled by the UFO from initial sighting to when last observed, the calculated speed is 70mph if the time required was 3 seconds or 53mph if 4 seconds had elapsed.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Round and metallic about 1/4 to 1/3 third the size of the planes they were were follwoing.;2000-10-19 07:40:00;2-3 minutes;Round and metallic about 1/4 to 1/3 third the size of the planes they were were follwoing. I was outside feeding my dogs when I observed two (2) large possible military airplanes.  They didn't appear to be commercial planes because the wingspan was very wide.  They were flying from west to east, very fast and quite high.  Planes are not unusual in our neighborhood because we live within a couple of miles of Salt Lake Intl and also the national guard has an airport nearby.  Also, Hill Field is just a few miles north of here.  Anyway, what was UNUSUAL about these planes was that each plane had three (3) spheres that were flying in the same airspace.  At first I thought they were parachutes or something attached to each plane.  There were two spheres on one side and the third was on the opposite side.  This was the same formation for each plane.  The spheres appeared to be metallic and they were flying into the rising sun so they reflected a golden color, it may only have been the reflection of the sun.  I have never seen anything like this so I watched with great interest.  The planes were flying one ahead of the other and my have been about a half mile apart, I am only guessing because distance between them is difficult to determine.  Anyway, they were definately going somewhere together.  Then while I was watching I became aware of two (2) more spheres flying behind the planes and the distance appeared to be several miles behind the planes and the first six (6) spheres.  These spheres were not attached to anything.  They also appeared to be metallic and they were at apporximately the same altitude and speed.  They all disappeared over the mountains within a few minutes.  The planes were the only thing that I could hear.  The second set of spheres did not make any noticable noise.  I called my husband as soon as I got to work and told him what happened.  It was very interesting and I decided to report this incident to your organization and see if anyone else has seen anything like this.  Thank you for being there.  I have been paying attention to the skies for a long time now, Salt Lake City ! has cont rails almost everyday.  Anyway, that's another subject.  I will continue to watch every morning, especially while I'm feeding my dogs.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

UFO sighting over Salt Lake City;2005-06-18 20:00:00;20 minutes;UFO sighting over Salt Lake City I looked up at the southern part of the sky and saw what I thought were stars, but the grouping was unusual. Then I saw what at first I thought were westher balloons, red in color, and sort of hanging there in the sky. I called out to a pair fo friends and had them look at the lights. Then they lights began to move around one red sphere moving to the south and the other to the north. I kept my focus on the one heading north until it stopped moving and then another starlike light came into view. The red sphere grew smaller and smaller and then both vanished to the naked eye.

Two silent white spheres crossing the early morning sky.;2012-04-21 05:23:00;2 min;Two silent white spheres crossing the early morning sky. I was at Lindsey Gardens by the Salt Lake Cemetery looking for the last of the meteor shower. I saw a really bright white sphere moving smoothly across the sky.  It seemed to get brighter and brighter like it was approaching or getting closer and I started to get scared, because I did not know what I was seeing.  Then another one not as bright was going in the opposite direction heading right to it and the brighter sphere moved down at a 90 degree angle! And then just kept on going.  The fainter sphere kept going in the other direction and quickly faded away. And then I watched the brighter sphere move across the sky.  It only took about 2 minutes for it to fade completely out of view.  As it faded away it looked just like a star in the sky.  There were no colored or blinking red lights on it. Just a beautiful bright orb looking thing.  I tried to get video of it, but my camera didn't register it.  About 3 minutes later, a plane went over head and I knew the sphere! was definitely not a plane.  The plane made noise and had two bright white lights on each wing and a blinking red light.  I don't know what it was. But I'm going there again with friends to see if it comes back.  It was amazing.  There's a lot going on at Dugway recently....it could be a military experiment. ;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Strange lights in Salt Lake.;2013-09-01 09:30:00;30 minutes;Strange lights in Salt Lake My friend and I were sitting on my porch again. Looking at the city lights right after sunset We noticed the lights out at Kennecott Copper mine  were really bright much brighter than usual . We grabbed our binoculars and noticed the big lights moving, pulsating. Blinking on and off at different times. There are lights out there all the time. I look at the mine, through binoculars everyday and night. There are roads at the mine and there are lights that line the road and at specific spots where they are digging. The big light, that we have seen for 3 weeks, appeared  at the top of the mountain right above the mine. It was there for 5 minutes. The smaller lights at the mine , became really active. Small red and green lights appeared and swirled around.  They were definitely on the part of the mountain where there are no roads, no access.  The smaller lights moved back and forth, up and down.  The larger lights moved into a shape that made it almost look like a massive ship , so strange  20 minutes into this, the big light appeared again.  This time right in front of us.( the place it has usually  been )  It hovered, pulsated, dimmed, grew bight and after 8 minutes, it moved straight across the sky and was gone.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
Close up glowing hovering white orb photographed green in two subsequent locations in Wasatch Mountains;2013-10-08 17:00:00;3 minutes;Close up glowing hovering white orb photographed green in two subsequent locations in Wasatch Mountains I was driving southbound on Utah state road 65 from the East Canyon Reservoir area (Wasatch mountains) toward Salt Lake City/Interstate 80 enjoying the autumn leaves on Oct. 8th, 2013 approximately 430-5pm MST.  Relatively few cars were on the winding mountain road and the sky was very overcast.  While driving on a fairly straight portion of the road, a glowing white light caught my eye.  The spherical object was approximately the size of a cantaloupe or basketball and was hovering stationary near the top of a large tree.  The object seemed to shimmer white light yet did not blink lights and did not change light color.  It was a glowing ball of white transparent light. I quickly braked and grabbed my iphone (which was in camera mode as I had been stopping periodically to take pictures of the autumn leaves) and snapped a picture of the glowing orb.  Mere seconds later, the orb appeared on the opposite side of the 2-lane road at approximately the same height off the ground, yet I did not witness the orb move from one location to the other. It was simply as if it disappeared as it moved between locations within seconds. I quickly snapped a second picture before the object simply was no longer visible.  No longer seeing the object, I proceeding in driving toward my destination. Once in SLC, I stopped to look at the two pictures of the object I had taken.  I was surprised to see that the object (which had appeared bright white to my eyes at the time I observed and photographed the object) appeared glowing GREEN, not white, in the two photographs!  The lighted object I witnessed and photographed was not a reflection from another vehicle or street sign, nor was it a malfunction of my iphone camera (inasmuch as I have taken literally hundreds of photos of this season's autumn leaves on the iphone at varying times of the day and early evening and have never seen a reflective green spherical object inadvertently appear in any of them)!   The green orbs shown in the attached photographs are what ap! peared to the naked eye as white glowing orbs.  I do not know what it was I witnessed and photographed I do however know I successfully captured whatever it was in two valid photos.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251

Orange orb seen from plane flying over northern Utah, Idaho or Oregon Nov. 21, 2015;2015-11-21 18:00:00;30 seconds;Orange orb seen from plane flying over northern Utah, Idaho or Oregon Nov. 21, 2015 ORANGE BALL OR ORB  On Saturday evening, October 21st, 2015, I was flying from Albuquerque to Seattle.  We left Albuquerque at 4.35 Mountain time, arriving in Seattle at 6.45 Pacific time. Somewhere north of Salt Lake City, looking at the flight path it could have been northern Utah, Idaho or Oregon – I really am not that familiar with the area, I looked out of the window on the left side of the plane, looking to the west.  We were flying, I think, at 36,000 feet.  The mountains were some way below us.  It was dark by that time, but I could see towns and communities lit up and I think there was some light from the moon.  Generally the sky was clear. I suddenly noticed a large, orange ball approaching from the north or north-west, below the plane, travelling very fast to the south or south-east.  It was very steady – glowing with light – lit from within – a bit like a huge ball of fuzzy orange felt!  It soon went behind the engine of the plane – I was sitting near the front.  I can’t begin to assess how big it was – it was far below our plane – I had the impression it was very big.  Many of the pictures I have seen on the Internet show the exact colour – a true orange – and shape and look. I remember there were some mountains overshadowing a small town.  The object was travelling below the tip of the mountains, around the tree line.  The trajectory was unwavering – no other lights to indicate it was a plane or helicopter.  It seemed to me to be travelling way too fast to be a plane. I don’t think I have any more to add.  I didn’t have anyone beside me to verify and it all happened so quickly.  I wonder if you have any more reports from passengers on the plane.   Being my first trip to and from Albuquerque to visit my daughter, I was very interested in looking out of the window all the way.;40.7038140239042;-111.881223187251
