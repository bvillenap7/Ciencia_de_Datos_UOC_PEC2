They popped up out of nowhere and faded out within a second.   The first three did this at the same time in the same places.  Then I saw random lights just like the others but only appeared one at a time.  They were in the same place in the sky but just south of the first three.   Just before I saw what looked like a little piece moon just setting over the mountains.  It was a orange hue.  But It faded after a few seconds confusing me.   Then realizing a few seconds later there was a full moon straight up in the sky so it could not be that.   I came back around in my car to see if I could recreate the light.  Nothing.  About 20 seconds after I saw that first light above the mountains is when I started seeing those weird lights.   I tried to record it but it only lasted about 5-10 seconds and my phones camera can't even record video of the moon at night.  It was the most unexplainable thing I have ever seen in my life.;38.3311;-112.9934
