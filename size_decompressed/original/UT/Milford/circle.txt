Three expanding/moving lights.;2019-04-21 03:00:00;Not sure;Three expanding/moving lights One very bright white light over the top of a mountain, another smaller one next to it that was moving around (occasionally hides behind the big one) and an orange light that would disappear and re-appear closer to the ground than the other two and was moving a lot.  When zooming in on these lights with my camera they look like layered rings that expand and shrink in a very erratic way.;38.3311;-112.9934
