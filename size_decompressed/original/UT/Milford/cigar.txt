I saw a cigar shaped object sliding effortlessly through the sky. It was perhaps a mile away and perhaps a 1000 feet in altitude maybe less.  It was traveling perhaps at 300 MPH.  It mad no sound at all.  The object was cigar shaped with a scintillating crystal like end approximately 1/7 of the total length of the object.  The nose was round (1/2 sphere).  It was shiny like polished aluminum and it reflected the sunlight.  Let’s call it “Shiny Silver” in color.  I saw this object for just a few seconds.  It was flying from north to south.  I have over the years seen seen eight sightings in all.  With witnesses. My son, my wife, my brothers in law were witness to them.  Contact me if you want to discuss them.  I made a drawing of the cigar shaped object.;38.3311;-112.9934
