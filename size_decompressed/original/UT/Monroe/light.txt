Multiple orb ufo's witnessed by four individuals.;2009-08-01 03:00:00;20 min.;Multiple orb ufo's witnessed by four individuals. My wife and I along with our two friends pulled into Monroe, Utah about 2:00 A.M.. We were staying for the weekend at the local hot springs.  All four of us had been on the road for five hours and decided to take a late night/early morning soak.  We were all relaxing in the communal hot tub when we started looking for falling stars.  My friend and I witnessed a few falling stars over a ten minute time span. My envious wife starring deep into the sky finally thought she got her lucky shooting star. She said,look at that star!  We all looked to the sky and witnessed what looked like a star moving across the sky at a high rate of speed.  The next thing we knew we were seeing these moving stars going in a variety of directions at different rates of speed.  They would appear and move from one point in the sky to another.  They seemed to dissapear as easy as they would appear.  All four of us wittnessed something unexplainable with a clear mind.  There is no way these! were satellites or known government aircraft, just by the different rates and directions they were all moving.;38.6578;-112.1261
