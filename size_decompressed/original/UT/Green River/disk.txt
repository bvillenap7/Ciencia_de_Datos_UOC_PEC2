Mothership coming in for a landing!;1973-10-30 04:00:00;15 seconds;Mothership coming in for a landing! I was Eastbound on I-70 it was Hunting season in the Utah Mountain's. I was about 20 miles west of Green River, Utah, around 400am...it was dark in the mountains that night.  I was coming out of some Mountains getting ready to drop into the next valley..  There are trees all around and then in my headlights were deer running across the road in front of me...I had to hit my brakes and come to stop.  Once I got going and pick-up speed I notice something to my left.  I turned to look down the valley and there was gaint spaceship coming in for a landing. THE valley lit up in a red glow..there was no sound.  The dome was rotating one direction and the saucer the other direction.   It was like looking at an Aircraft carrier passing in front of you.  I stood in the highway and watched it pass...it was a life changing experince... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));38.9992;-110.1574
Saucer and possible Cigar shaped object in sunset.;2016-04-21 20:00:00;30 seconds;Saucer and possible Cigar shaped object in sunset. We were driving on our way to Goblin Valley and had to pull over on the exit for a potty break (3 yr. old).  While we were sitting on the side of the road I took a picture of the sunset.  Later that night I looked at the picture and noticed a dark spec above the San Rafael Swell horizon.  When I zoomed in on it there was a saucer shape and also just to the left of this is a smaller cigar shape.;38.9992;-110.1574
