((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the two images that are alluded to by the witness.  The first shows a contrail, but we have no way of knowing whether it was generated by the Aurora aircraft.  It may be nothing more than a normal contrail that has taken on a buttermilk appearance, which often happens in a slightly turbulent atmosphere.  Also, the second photo does appear to show two amorphous blobs, that appear to be somewhat triangular in shape.  Our computer monitor does not allow us to identify them, however.  We doubt that an Aurora aircraft would fly in formation with another, although that is a guess.  Also, if they were flying as low as the photo suggests they would be, they would be very loud to anyone on the ground, and they would be difficult to miss.  Our assumptions are predicated on the larger assumption that the Auora aircraft actually exists.  PD));38.9992;-110.1574
