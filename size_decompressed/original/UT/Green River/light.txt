9 groupings of light, all in a row except one group slightly above the others.;2017-12-09 20:31:00;10 to 15 Min;I took my 11-year-old son and his 12-year-old cousin camping just outside the Goblin Valley State Park in Green River, Utah, on Dec 9, 2017. We started seeing reddish pulsating lights traveling slowly across the horizon, looking west. It was winter, so it was mostly dark outside. I grabbed my camera, a Sony A7 with a 50 mm lens using an f2 aperture and a 6400 iso. The picture has a total of 9 groupings of light, all in a row except one group slightly above the others. The 8 groups had three lights per group that pulsated a reddish color, and the one group slightly above had white pulsing lights. So all together, 42 slowly moving pulsating lights. I also took a video as well. I'm not sure if it was helicopters or not, but it was definitely weird.;38.9992;-110.1574
