We were traveling through some rolling hills when all of a sudden a bright flash in the sky caught my eye.  I focused my attention to the area and then I was able to see many objects in the sky. The objects seemed to be of diamond shape, but completely flat, so just imagine a 2-d diamond.  It was metallic in color as it reflected the sunlight extremely well when the horizontal plane was perpindicular to the ground.  I immeadeately told my friend about what I was obeseving and told him to focus his attention towards that airspace, but he was not able to observe them. I remembered that I had been wearing my polarized sunglasses so I took them off so he could have a look, and lo and behold he could see them too. This was the case for a minute or two but when we grew closer we were able to observe them with the naked eye. The objects movement was so calculated, it was most reminiscent to a group of sardines swimming in the ocean, in that they all were oreinted in the same direction and turning and interacting with one another with crazy precision. It was funny because my friend and I had been keeping ourselves entertained by sharing mostly everything that we have heard/seen about ufo's from coast2coast and various other surces and BAM! who would have known that we would be able to observe something so awesome as what we saw.;38.9992;-110.1574
