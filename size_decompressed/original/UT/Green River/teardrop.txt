Teardrop shaped object, Green River, Utah.;2020-01-28 05:30:00;5-8 seconds;Teardrop shaped object, Green River, Utah. On 01/28/2020, in Green River, Utah, on I70, at 5:30am, I saw a teardrop shaped object in the sky.  This teardrop shaped object, appeared seemingly out of nowhere, at the top of my vision, at the top of my windshield, causing me to lower and turn my head to see it.  It appeared to have red/ orange lights outlining the object.  Although I should state that I am slightly colorblind.  The object was large, but it is difficult for me to tell how high in the sky the object was.  It was very dark.  The object quickly appeared, I got a good look at it, it stayed stationary for a brief moment.  It then zipped across the sky to my left.  Same red/ orange lights remained.  The object then shot upwards and produced a bright, but contained, white flash of light.  And it disappeared into the dark sky.  The object moved in a sort of “check mark“ path.;38.9992;-110.1574
