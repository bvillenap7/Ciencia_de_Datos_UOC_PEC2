I saw what looked like a line of stars moving slowly together.  Sort of like a caterpillar. ((NUFORC Note:  Space X satellites.  PD));2019-05-27 22:20:00;5 minutes;I was stargazing and I saw what looked like a line of stars moving slowly all together.  Sort of like a caterpillar made of lights, moving close together and all in a row across the sky. Every once in a while one of the lights would glow brighter. There also seemed to be a dark tail that followed the line and blacked out the stars behind it. It moved really slowly all the way across the sky. I saw it with my friend and another friend who was camping in the same town saw it as well.;38.5677;-109.5271
