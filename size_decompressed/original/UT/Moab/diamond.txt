One morning four of us were hiking in the LaSalle Mountains outside Moab, Utah. I was in the lead heading up a ravine when I turned around to see where my companions were. They had gathered around a deep crevice and were checking it out. One of them had a camera and was taking pictures. I looked at them, then looked up and saw a very large diamond-shaped object moving slowly, from west to east, across the sky. It was gray, metal-like, hard-edged, resembling a squarish box tilted with sharp corners perpendicular to the horizon. I watched it float by and yelled for my friends who couldn't hear because of the noise of the water rushing through the canyon. Finally, two of them hiked away from the guy taking pictures and looked up at me pointing to the sky. They turned to look and saw the object for about ten or fifteen seconds until it went behind a ridge. Afterwards we were all pretty amazed and had no idea what it was. Unfortunately, the person with the camera had not seen it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));38.5677;-109.5271
