Bright light in the sky with corresponding dust/cloud on the ground.  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 19:00:00;10 minutes;bright light in the sky with corresponding dust/cloud on the ground While driving along Interstate 70 westbound out of Moab, UT, but not before Green River, I saw a light low in the sky, roughly 500-1000’ above the deck, with an apparent cloud or dust plume below the light around the ground.  The light was white/yellow in color.  It moved west for about 10 mins in the same direction I was travelling.  I never reached the cloud or dust plume along the highway before the light dissipated. My initial impression was that it was an aircraft from the Moab airport, but it seemed too low for a fixed wing aircraft.  I thought perhaps it was a helicopter shining a light on the ground, and subsequently saw a Highway Patrol car in the median of the road (I’m certain that he would have been in a position to film this event as he was facing West). Having heard detailed reports of the events in CA on this night, I’m almost convinced that what I saw was related, though my distance from CA makes my think I was too far to actually see that.  I’m wondering if this was part of a missile shield launch from UT to intercept something in CA. I heard no noise from this event.  It was hard to see any details as the highway out there is very dark and there is little ambient light from the surroundings.;38.5677;-109.5271
Super bright flash.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible flare from Iridium satellite??  PD));2016-04-09 22:05:00;5 seconds;super bright flash While out filming the night sky with my camera, I had my camera trained on a distant bright star (SSW) and a bright light flashed very brightly then extinguished and the whole event took place within the span of 5 seconds.  A friend of mine did not see this since he was on his phone and by the time he looked up it was over. The star is bright and I can see it every night but this flash was as bright as Venus and was pretty intense.;38.5677;-109.5271
