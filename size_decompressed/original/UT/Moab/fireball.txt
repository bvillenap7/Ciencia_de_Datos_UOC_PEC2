I was there for about 5 minutes then vanished behind a cloud. I was on a camping trip with my school.  My frind and I were looking up at the sky when we saw a fire ball going across the sky.  I have no clue how fast or big it was but it was amazing.  It was red, yellow, black, and orange.  It went behind a cloud for a few seconds then came back out. It had a tail about twice the size of it.  It made no sound at all and had a haze around it.  My frind and I called over someone else to see it but by the time he looked up it went behind anoughter cloud.  We looked up for about five minutes but it never came out.;38.5677;-109.5271

It was probably a large meteor or fireball as it is termed.  About five minutes later I heard a large booming sound which I suppose could have been the meteor hitting the ground;38.5677;-109.5271

Object entering the atmosphere, 3 red, green and blue lights spinning and slowing down as if landing.;2006-10-15 00:15:00;1 minute;Object entering the atmosphere, 3 red, green and blue lights spinning and slowing down as if landing. The event actually took place about 20 min North-west of Moab. We were driving in momentary silence along I-70 when my friend pointed at the sky and exclaimed he saw a meteor entering the atmosphere. The light was brighter than the moon and dimmed as it entered the atmosphere. We then saw what looked like 3 objects breaking away from the bright light as it dimmed. As the green, red and blue lights began coming closer to the ground we realized that they were not separate but attached to something spinning possibly triangular in shape.  The strange thing was thier was no noise, no trail of dust or fire and as the object came closer to the ground, it began slowing over the mountain just ahead of us as if it were landing.  Seeing as we made fun of stories like this, we continued to rationalize that it wasn't as it seemed. We pulled off of a truck stop about a mile down the highway where several truckers had pulled off as well. We looked over the ridge to see if we could still see the object, but it was further away than we had originally thought. After realizing we had just encountered a UFO, two truckers pulled up next to us and asked if we had seen the 'lights'. We talked with them about what we had seen and their story was exactly as we saw it as well.  If anyone has anymore information or saw the 'fireball' entering the atomosphere, please report it here as we would also like to compare what others saw that night, thanks.
