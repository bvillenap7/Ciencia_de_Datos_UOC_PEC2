It took 3 of us to set up the antenna tower 40 min.  while we were waiting for the chopper to pick us up I noticed an object southeast emmitting a soft glowing cicular light slowly travelling up the mountain towards us.  It was 2 miles out aprox. it then stopped and stayed stationary for about 15 to 20 min. in the same place. Realizing that this was something we never saw before I took a picture of it with my digital camera. We also noticed far accross the valley 2 more at the exact same altitude in a triangular formation with eachother. The helicopter picked the 2 of us up-1 man was left back and he noticed that after the helicopter took off the objects were gone.;39.6906;-111.8404
