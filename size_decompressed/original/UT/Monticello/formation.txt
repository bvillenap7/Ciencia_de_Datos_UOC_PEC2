Odd shimmering lights over Midwest;2021-04-11 22:01:00;5 seconds;Odd shimmering lights over Midwest Hi,  	I'm an amateur astrologist. On 04/11/2021 @ 2201 hrs, I was deciding on setting up equipment. Directly over head I notice a shimmering circle of stars. Looking very much like a heat mirage, only in the clear dark sky. 	Surrounding the shimmering were 8 'lights'? in a semi circle, moving uniformly together. White in color moving  much quicker than night lights move. (2-3x more quickly). The lights traveled in a southern to northern direction. I have many apps to help with night sightings. All aircraft Flightradar24), satellites (Heavens Above) and many star charts.  All the above showed no active. Total time was about 5 seconds and gone. Clearoutside.com reported my site with 10 miles visibility, new moon and Class 2 Bortle (0.18 mcd/m2) 	Of course, I was alone, but contacted you via phone.  	Steve;37.9217;-109.3153
