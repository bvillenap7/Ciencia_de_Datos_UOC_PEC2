Strange movement of light over Canyonlands NP in October 2020.;2020-10-20 22:00:00;10 minutes;Strange movement of light over Canyonlands NP in October 2020. I was motivated to report this incident after reading about the upcoming Pentagon report.  I camped in Canyonlands National Park on October 20 and while watching the stars saw a single light in the distance that looked like a plane or star and appeared to descend and/or move further into the distance, before turning sharply in a smooth movement at a very high speed. It moved way too suddenly to be a conventional airplane. The light from it slowly faded as it headed in new direction.;37.9217;-109.3153
