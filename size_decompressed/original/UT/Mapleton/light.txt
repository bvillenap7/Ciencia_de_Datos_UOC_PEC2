Woke up at 4:30 in the morning and was looking out kitchen window at the street in front of my house and the 5 acre alfalfa field on the other side of the street.  Soft ambient light outside was, what I thought, a full moon so I could see things rather well.   Saw a white light moving off to the side of the house and thought it was car headlights coming down the lane, but no car came.  The light suddenly was right in front of our house, and moved away from our house sweeping across the alfalfa field like a big search light.  The light suddenly disappeared and I realized it was really dark outside and there was no ambient moonlight.  I never heard a sound of any kind and was too spooked to go outside.;40.13;-111.5783
