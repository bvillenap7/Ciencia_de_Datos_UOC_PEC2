Grey Oval over interstate 15, Utah County;2007-07-05 15:20:00;20 Seconds;Grey Oval over interstate 15, Utah County While driving on Interstate 15 near my parents house in Mapleton, Utah, me, my brother and two of my friends were returning from a week in Lewiston, Idaho.  Then my brother pointed out what he thought was a Chinook, around a two miles away, but soon realized it was traveling too fast. Then it seemed to change direction and turn west and started to pull towards us at quite high speed, perhaps around 400-450 mph.   It then shot over some houses and fields in nearby Springville and over the interstate about 250 ft. behind our truck.  I clearly saw it, it was dark gray and was an oval shape.  When it crossed the interstate, it was probably only 400 or so ft' above ground.  Also, the disk made no noise and on the bottom of the disk there was a blue-metalic cross. When it crossed the interstate, the car radio changed frequency and ever since this accident, the radio keeps playing up.;40.13;-111.5783
