After a short rainstorm, I was in our back yard, looking for a rainbow with my four-year old daughter.   Looking East toward the mountains, I see a spot of light hovering in the sky.  I thought it to be the landing lights an airplane at first, then noticed about five other points of light near the first.   The lights seemed to dance around each other for a time.  I watched for a short time, then each light seemed to fade into the clouds one after another.   While I watched, the lights never moved far from their locations in the sky.  There was no apparent pattern to them or anything like that.   Just apparently random points of light playing in the sky.;40.3495;-111.8998
