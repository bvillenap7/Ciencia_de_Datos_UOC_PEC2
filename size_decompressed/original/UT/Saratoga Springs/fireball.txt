Green light meteorite.  ((NUFORC Note:  Source does not indicate date of sighting.  PD));2019-11-16 03:30:00;2 seconds;Green light meteorite I was driving to work going down Pony Express Road when a meteorite like object burst down from the clouds towards the ground.  It burned in a bright green light very similar to the green light on a traffic light but more intense. Half way on its trajectory it broke down into 3 pieces and vanished before hitting the ground. It seemed as if it was shot out of something that was either inside or above the clouds. This event happened about 6 months ago.  Sorry for not reporting it before. I am a male nurse and an immigrant from Brazil.;40.3495;-111.8998
