3 Ufo's over Utah Lake 4/29/12;2012-04-29 17:00:00;45 sec;3 Ufo's over Utah Lake 4/29/12 I am on my iPod so I don't have a word processor.  My husband & I were having a BBQ on our deck facing east across Utah Lake.  I heard a plane so looked up and saw 3 round bright objects above the plane heading south.  The plane was heading north to the airport.  I grabbed my binoculars and called to my husband.  I saw 3 round metallic objects traveling fast in a V formation.  I gave the binoculars to my husband and he also saw them and we both agree they weren't birds or jets because they were very high and didn't have wings.  They were bright gold and metallic and round.  We have never seen anything like this and don't have any idea what we saw.  We did not think to get a picture.;40.3495;-111.8998
