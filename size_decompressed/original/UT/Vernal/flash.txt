As we were driving west toward Vernal on U.S. 40, we saw a flashing light that looked like it was perhaps an airport beacon.  It flashed at a regular pulse.  It was very bright white with a bluish tone.  it flaired out it a geometric, multi-pointed, three dimensional star shape. i could see it for several miles as we approached.  It was stationary until we were a few 100 yards away.  Then, as it flashed it reappeared to the north(my right) and higher it kept going gradually higher and right more qiuckly.  It excellerated at a slow to faster pace then turned upward and west blurring in its speed into disapearance. My friend and I were agreed that we saw the same thing.  On our return June 19.  Since my freind saw a sign for Ashley Creek,we new where we sighted the lights.  There were empty fields and nothing in the area that could have caused the lights.
