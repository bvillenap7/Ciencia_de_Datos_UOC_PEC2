Large green fireball over a lake.;2013-09-23 20:45:00;10 seconds;Large green fireball over a lake. On an evening walk, my friend and I saw what appeared to be a large green shooting star or meteor very low in the sky.  It disintegrated into several smaller pieces before reaching the ground.  It was across town, possibly over a large lake.  The light was bright enough to be seen out of the corner of my eye gaining my full attention.  It lasted long enough for me to yell for my friend to look and also see it.;40.439755882353;-109.542117647059
