So we got in our truck and proceeded over the ridge to investigate. We ran out of road so we proceeded on foot when we got over the third ridge we saw two more crafts. We then got closer and saw what appered to be people, we then stoped and observed. Myself and some hunting buddies were up in the High Uinta's Elk hunting on October 19, 1998 when we saw what appeared to be a plane crash. We then got in our trucks and started over the first ridge. As we aproched the second ridge the road stoped and we proceeded on foot. As we got over the second ridge we saw to more crafts, we kept going and as we got closer we saw what appeared to be people so we stopped. By this time it was about 1:13 a.m.. We slowly stalked up on the site.;40.439755882353;-109.542117647059
Blue orb that changed into a floating alien being that then descended into a bright blue craft that shot off into the night sky. Earlie;2013-06-01 03:00:00;24 hours;Blue orb that changed into a floating alien being that then descended into a bright blue craft that shot off into the night sky.  Earlier that evening, was lying in bed when a thing wrapped around my leg.  Couldn't move and various clicking noises were heard outside my window.  I've tried to relate them with several insects, bats, cicadas, you name it and nope!  They were talking to each other like binary code but fast and guttural.   The next morning was when my son said he had encountered the blue orb that transitioned into a tiny alien being and shot up into a blue craft.  He said he tried to throw a rock at it and his arm paralyzed...that's when it turned into this little floating being and shot up into the craft and it dissolved?   I just wonder having been interested in the Skinwalker Ranch if it didn't follow me some how from there?;40.439755882353;-109.542117647059
