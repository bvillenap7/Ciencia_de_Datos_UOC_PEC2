Silver disk.;2000-07-15 12:00:00;1-3 minutes;Pulling out onto 500 West one bright sun shiny afternoon in Vernal, Utah, from the 7-11 saw a silver disk hovering in place above the tree behind the fire station.  I was with my son who was about 10 and we both saw it.  It started moving south very slowly and I tried to follow it across main street in Vernal, but the light went yellow and I stopped and sat and watched it get higher and higher in the air and then it disappeared like it fizzled out into the air.  It had no lights and was illuminated by the sun?  Like solid steel and then kept getting farther and farther away.  I've never seen anything like it.  It was over Vernal Utah bonafide UFO.  That's all I can say.  Thanks.;40.439755882353;-109.542117647059
It was a saucer with 4-5 lights blinking unlike any aircraft I have ever seen and sat in the sky for 45 minutes or longer.;2015-09-08 10:30:00;45 minutes;It was a saucer with 4-5 lights blinking unlike any aircraft I have ever seen and sat in the sky for 45 minutes or longer. I went outside to feed my animals and looked up at the sky over U Hill and noticed that there were 4 lights in a row and were blinking.  They sat there for about 15 minutes then started moving north and I could see that the saucer tilted to the right and then the left and then sat there for a while longer.  Then moved south very slowly.   Then looked like it was slowly going towards the ground but it was too far away to tell.   Then it gained altitude again.  I had a client call me and I told him to go outside and look toward U Hill and asked if he could see what I was seeing so I knew I wasn't going crazy and he said he could see the same thing.;40.439755882353;-109.542117647059
