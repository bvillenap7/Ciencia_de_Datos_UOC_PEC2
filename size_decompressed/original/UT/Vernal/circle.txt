Bright object observed over Dry Fork Canyon, UT.  ((NUFORC Note:  Object appears to us to be consistent with a twinkling star.

As my wife and I were doing astrophotography, I realized there was a light in front of us that looked like a bright flashlight moving.  I grabbed my binoculars to see who and what it could be.  I then realized the light was well above the top of the canyon where we stayed.  The light was brighter than the rest of the stars I was photographing and it moved up and down, and side to side at a high acceleration rate.  I initially thought it could be a drone but after seeing the terrain and examining the video I captured I do not think a drone can do what I witnessed the object doing.  The video shows the object spinning on its own axis. After about half an hour  of observing the object we went to bed, at 3am, the object was no longer in the area where we observed it.

Giant bright red light in sky as well as other lights that we say phase out;2021-02-03 20:20:00;1.5 minutes;Giant bright red light in sky as well as other lights that we say phase out Me and my wife were driving back home toward the Willow Park Apartments and saw a massive red light in the sky. It was solid red not flashing. It was there for about 45 secs and then went away the two other bright lights appeared in the same spot and phased out like is you turned off a old box tv. I know this was not planes we see only 3 planes every 6 months and they were about 5 times the size of a plane.  Also as this was spotted all dogs in area starting barking and cows started mooing.
