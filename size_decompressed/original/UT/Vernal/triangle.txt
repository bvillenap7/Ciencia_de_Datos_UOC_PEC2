V-shaped craft with dimmed mini-lights around it.;2004-05-08 22:50:00;1-2 minutes;V-shaped craft with dimmed mini-lights around it. I stepped outside to view the stars with a friend.I was showing him Leo.He grabbed my shoulders and turned me and said Oh my God look at that!I turned and saw a v- shaped craft with very dimmed lights all the way around it, traveling rather fast across the sky. We watched it until it went past a street light and we could not see it any further.It was the strangest looking craft I have ever seen in the night sky. It was as if it were a bird or other object with wings yet it had dim lights .;40.439755882353;-109.542117647059
