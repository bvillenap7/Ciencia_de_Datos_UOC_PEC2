From the time one of us took notice and alerted the others, we watched for about 3-5 minutes in the northern sky, moving east to west across until out of sight headed NW about level with the North Star.  No moon in the sky.  A cluster of an estimated 100+ circular, bright bluish white lights with about 20-30 trailing slightly behind the main cluster or formation.  First looked like a glittery ribbon until watching and noticing none were fading out but were moving independently of each other.  Looked similar to balloons but appeared much farther away and fast moving while changing direction and speed, like fish in a school.

Another characteristic that stuck out was the three lights on the upper part of the disc.  They each lit up in order, from left to right.  The pattern didn't stop for the entire 45 minute duration.  There was only one object, like described, seen.  The luminance of the LED-like color began to lessen as the sun went down over the horizon.  The object was very defined.;38.2998;-111.4115
