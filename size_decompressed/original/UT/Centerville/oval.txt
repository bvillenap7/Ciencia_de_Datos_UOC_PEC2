Orange light over Davis County;2016-11-04 22:20:00;20 seconds;Orange light over Davis County While driving on I-15 tonight my wife and I saw a dim orange light over Centerville/Farmington Utah - no flashing or blinking lights visible, and fairly large in the sky.  Initially thought it was an airplane, or helicopter.   Exited the freeway and rolled down the car window to listen, but there was no sound coming from the craft.  Pulled in to a parking lot to watch, and lost sight of it.   Once parked, I exited my vehicle.  The object was gone.;40.9295;-111.8645
