My best friend and I were hot-tubbing around 10:30pm (22:30) and were having a great time.  It was a crystal clear sky that night, and I was admiring the stars.  I noticed something fly above us, its hard to say exactly how high up, but I'd guess 5 stories up.   It was some sort of object flying silently above us, and honestly my friend and I thought it was a bat at first, however I noticed 3 lights on it.  She did not believe me, and dismissed it as a bat.  I just agreed with her, until, it flew back over us for a second time, a bit closer.  You could clearly see the triangle object, it looked the size of a small car.  You couldn't make out details, but there were three lights in a triangle pattern.   We got out of the hot tub and walked around watching it for a while, it was flying fairly evenly, but would occasionally hover.  At one point, a dog noticed and started barking like crazy!   A minute after that it floated off out of sight, towards Farmington.  It was a very! neat experience, I've seen a few other UFOs in my life, and this was probably the second coolest I've experienced.  Have a good day everyone.  :) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she confirmed that the sighting occurred on the date indicated above, and not on a date in 2016.
