Falling star like light object making erratic maneuvers;2009-01-10 18:10:00;several minutes;Falling star like light object making erratic maneuvers On Saturday, January 10th 2009 at approximately 6:10pm in the early dark evening, I witnessed the following account.  About a mile north before the city of Bountiful, Utah traveling south on I-15, I saw above me through the front windshield a bright white/yellow falling star traveling north to south my same direction. The “star” traveled quickly across the sky then “stopped in mid-air” over what appeared to be the ensign peak area between Bountiful and SLC.  This startled me and I said, “What the heck is that?”. No falling star here as the light then moved back north east over North Salt Lake and made a slow wide circling pattern as if it were going to land. At this point my wife said, “Maybe it’s a helicopter going to land”.  The light then traveled west quickly across the interstate and suddenly maneuvered straight up for about 300-500 feet over I-215 just south of the Legacy interchange. After that it traveled south towards the 7th north exit in west SLC desending at a high rate and disappeared from our site.  I am a private pilot and aware of natural speeds and maneuvers a “normal” plane or helicopter would make, but this to me seemed to fast and erratic in behavior. My wife thought she could see blinking lights around the main light. I could not see position lights only the white/yellow light it emitted from all angles. Besides, this is controlled airspace, would Salt Lake Center allow this kind of evasive maneuvering?  I was curious to hear if anyone else saw what we witnessed so I called an FAA flight briefer and he gave me the number to this reporting site.;40.8793606382978;-111.868767021276
Rapidly moving formation of lights.;2010-08-29 21:35:00;10 seconds;Rapidly moving formation of lights.   I was leaving for work Sunday night and looked up in the sky to check the weather. To the north I saw a fuzzy blob that was coming my way very fast.   It quickly became several points of light that flew over slightly east of my position and kept going south until they vanished into the sky glow over Salt Lake City to the south. There must have been about two dozen of them flying in formation.  They looked like stars of medium intensity, that is, they were the about the same size and color.  It wasn't a fixed pattern but they moved in relation to each other.  There was no sound that I could hear and the lights did not flash or leave a trail.  They covered about 2/3 of the visible sky in about 10 seconds.  There was no telling how high or how fast they were actually going but I’m guessing they were about the height of the nearby mountain tops.;40.8793606382978;-111.868767021276

But as soon as we ran out side, we saw an orange light. headed east towards Morgan, Utah, hovering low under 500ft.  after about a minute we see 3 helicopters fly in from the north trying to route this light one is helicopter is flying a search pattern and the other 2 are chasing the orange light.   as soon as the light went over the mountains we lost sight and went inside thinking that was odd.;40.8793606382978;-111.868767021276

I work for a large airline, this is why it caught my eye, thinking it was a aircraft.  I watched.  I noted the light was consistent and was not blinking, then the speed really made me pay attention. This light was aprox 10 times brighter than the ISS or any satellite I have seen.  I am sure it cleared the state of Utah in approx. 3 to 4 minutes the direction was from north to south heading at 185 degrees continuing in a straight line.   I am unsure of the altitude but my best guess would be 25,000 feet or better.  Just to make sure, I check the space station tracking page right after the light went to low in the horizon to view. This light appeared to be more like the new car headlights HID LIGHTS.  There was no sound at all.;40.8793606382978;-111.868767021276
Bright light - minimal movement. Too high to be a helicopter.  No known planes or stars in the area.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2017-01-29 19:35:00;20 minutes;Bright light - minimal movement.  Too high to be a helicopter. No known planes or stars in the area. In the dark of night we saw a light in the western region of the valley. We thought it was a helicopter.  However, it was too high and too stationary for it to be a helicopter.  We looked up flights in the area as well as star charts and could not find an explanation.  However, we do notice that it is moving minimally very minimally side to side.;40.8793606382978;-111.868767021276
