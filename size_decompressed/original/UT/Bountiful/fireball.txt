She said hury come see these objects.  When I came out there was only three left so I watched for a minute then started to film using my iPhone 4S.  After one went to the north (wind out of the north) it faded out leaving one bright fireball, then she honked the horn and pointed to another one rising from the low eastern sky.  The last one finally faded out. I have the video if you would like to see it.;40.8793606382978;-111.868767021276

I was out jogging and noticed a bright orange fireball type of object flying pretty slowly across the sky.  It seemed like a circular object that appeared to be on fire.  It was traveling from South to North. As it proceeded to move northward, the bright orangeness started to fade a little bit and I noticed it had a silver/Transparent appearance.  It flew across the sky for about 3 minutes. About 1 minute later, I saw another object with the exact description listed above.  It was flying in the same direction and flew across the sky for about 2 minutes.  However, it was traveling faster than the first object.
