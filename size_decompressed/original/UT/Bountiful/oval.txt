There’s an airport close to the area but it wasn’t an airplane. Flying in a straight line, very close to the mountains, which is not safe for a regular airplane. One military helicopter was there, probably chasing the object or making visual contact for confirmation. Everything was seen from the freeway going to Salt Lake City.;40.8793606382978;-111.868767021276
