Stationary lights in formation above the Great Salt Lake.;2007-12-23 23:00:00;9-10 minutes;Stationary lights in formation above the Great Salt Lake. The first night 12/22/07, there were 3 lights to the west over the Great Salt Lake at about 30 degrees up from the horizon in a triangle that just sat there for about 5 minutes, then the top one cruised off to the north and after a few more minutes the other two slowly moved to the north and then they all dissapeared. The second night 12/23/07, at about 11pm, I saw another stationary light to the north at about 40 degrees up from the horizon. I was able to get about 3 minutes of video of the three on the first night. I have an observatory in my backyard,  so I hurried out there and threw the roof open and I got my small refractor on one of the lights and it looked like a big square translucent parachute type thing with 3 spinning orange lights in the middle, and it kinda looked like it was shooting off embers or something wierd.  They eventually all burned out and I lost the object in the darkness.  They seemed to be about 3-4 miles north of the Salt Lake International Airport,  but they were not any kind of aircraft I have ever seen.;40.8793606382978;-111.868767021276
Same formation of lights seen again.;2010-09-02 21:35:00;6-8 seconds;Same formation of lights seen again. This is a follow up to the report I posted Sunday, August 29th.   I observed the same group of lights again on Sept. 2nd  at the same time, 9:35pm.  This time they were closer when first noticed and were diving and turning before continuing on approximately the same track as before.  The maneuvering they did looked to me like they were a flock of birds that have had some kind of lights attached to them in order to track them visually at night. I have no idea who might be doing this or why.;40.8793606382978;-111.868767021276
