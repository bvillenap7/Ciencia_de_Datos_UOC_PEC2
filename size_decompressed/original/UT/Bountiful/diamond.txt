Altitude unknown but guess is 60,000 plus  I am almost positive this was no satellite as I did some research and could not find any in this orbit at the time I viewed object.  My guess is it was 4X brighter than the ISS, Sure looked suspect thats why I filed this report.;40.8793606382978;-111.868767021276
