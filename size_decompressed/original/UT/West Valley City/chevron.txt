Gliding object viewed 3 different times in about 20 minute span.;2020-08-12 23:15:00;15 seconds;Gliding object viewed 3 different times in about 20 minute span. It seemed to glide across the sky, and was relatively slow moving. At first I thought it was a plane, but then it seemed much too close, just above our heads. So then I thought it was a large bird or a maybe a large kite, when it seemed to move faster and was getting distant. At this point I noticed about 6 points of light around the perimeter of its shape, right before it disappeared. It didnâ€™t disappear on the horizon though, it just vanished out of the sky. Both my wife and I saw it. We saw a second one about 10 minutes later across the sky in the opposite direction. And I saw a third much fainter one far up in the sky about another 10 minutes later.;40.6980988764044;-112.000386516854
