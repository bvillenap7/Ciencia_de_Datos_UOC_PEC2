bright star like object white and kinda yellowish for two hours;2009-01-04 18:45:00;over an hr in a half;bright star like object white and kinda yellowish for two hours at approximatley 1845 hours on the above date i was driving with a friend to go to his house a few miles away from my residence,when we turned into his apartment area there is a large open area with a very wide view to the sky,when i noticed a very bright star in the south,south west position in the sky,over the mtns at kennecott mine, the color of the star was a lil strange, it looked like the two colors were blending together a lil a cross between white and yellow. it looked like just a really bright star from mine and my friends location but while we were watching this star like thing. I had called my roommates who are police officers to step outside to look at this abnormally big bright star,now me and my friend are watching this thing in the sky approximate altitude for this object 10,ooo-20,000 feet and was moving ever so slightly to the north at first and then back towards the south, at the time of our sighting alot of airplanes were in the sky all on the slc approach pattern airplanes coming in from the south end of the salt lake valley and also coming in from the west, this object was above the approaching airplanes and just off to the west enough so as not to bother incoming airplanes,to the casual observer it would look like a star or an airplane turning in from the west to land at slc but when you really looked at it for more than a min you soon begin to realize this aint no airplane or a star,now my two roomates were alot closer to this thing in the sky, they said the object observed to them it looked kinda egg shaped and when it was moving it would do little circles in a short pattern then quit,the color s on the object never changed, stayed constant in intensity and color,now an hour has passed and this thing is still in the sky as me and my friend are leaving his residence and are heading north on I-215 and got off at exit 700 north in north salt lake, the object was directly to our west now the closest we were to this strange star thing was about five miles away,my two r! oommates felt what ever it was very big in size,since this incident has intrigued one of my roomates and so she will be carrying a camera with her from now on,i have reported here before and had worked at the mine for about seven years and in that time i have found quite a few people who have seen strange lights out there in the surrounding hills around kennecott .;40.6980988764044;-112.000386516854
