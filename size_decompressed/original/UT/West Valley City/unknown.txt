White craft shoots in an arc south before anyone could react;2012-04-15 19:00:00;<1 second;White craft shoots in an arc south before anyone could react I was walking down my driveway to talk with some people in their car.  Another person was already talking to them.  As I was walking down the driveway I see this white craft shoot in this arc from the west to a little east of where I was and travel south.  Before I even had a chance to speak or react the craft was out of site.  The person at the end of the driveway saw the tail end of it too. I donâ€™t know how far it traveled but I know it was faster than any plan I see in the sky.  I also believe it was NOT a shooting star because it changed directions.  It was an arc that took it a little north and then shot south faster than I could react. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));40.6980988764044;-112.000386516854
