A white sphere flew north to south over West Valley City, Utah in about 10 seconds time;2012-07-08 17:50:00;1 minute;A white sphere flew north to south over West Valley City, Utah in about 10 seconds time Sunday July 8th 2012,I was talking to my neighbor and he told me he saw a white sphere flying from north to south.  I told him to report it but he said he would not.  So I am reporting what he told me.   About 5:50 PM he was sitting in a chair just outside his garage when he saw a white sphere flying north to south. he described it as a white, sharp ball flying at about the same altitude that the planes flying on final approach to Salt Lake International airport.   He said the sphere was about the size of a Volks-Wagon Beetle.(his words)  He said to compare the speed, from his perspective, it was moving about twice the speed as he sees planes fly at altitude.  I don't know if you can use second hand reports, but I know you said on the radio that you would like all UFO's reported.  Use this report if you get any more from the West Valley City area.  I don't think he was lying to me.;40.6980988764044;-112.000386516854
