Bright light bouncing around the wess salt lake valley sky.;2013-08-05 00:15:00;1 hour;Bright light bouncing around the wess salt lake valley sky. I am a constant sky watcher, if I could get paid to do it... I'd be rich!  I currently work in Planning and Development.  My roommate is an industrial fire fighter and always makes fun of me being so adamant about some of the strange stars I see.   Last night we were out in our back yard and I happened to notice a really bright star, brighter than all the rest.  I stood there watching it for about 3 minutes when I noticed it was moving, almost bouncing side to side and disappeared at one point.  It came back and I ran inside to get  my camera, but without a tripod I couldnt get a steady picture or video of it.  I could just tell that the brightness of the light was something inside this atmosphere. It looked soo close.  I couldn't make out a shape, but it easily blended into the sky as another star.  It looked like it could have been hovering over Tooele or Magna.  I have a few videos that are not really steady.;40.6980988764044;-112.000386516854
Orange orb seen traveling southwest in the sky before blinking off.;2013-09-23 21:11:00;90 seconds;orange orb seen traveling southwest in the sky before blinking off. At approximately 21:11, (9:11pm) I was walking outside to go to my truck to go to the grocery store. As I walked outside I looked to the east and at that time I noticed a light in the sky.  At this hour I was not used to seeing stars in that location and it was in the wrong place to be an airplane as the flight pattern for the airport is above my house.  This light was many miles to the east closer to the mountain that is approximately 10-15 miles away. 	This Light is what is commonly called the “fireball UFO’s”.  It was an orange orb seemed to be glowing from the inside.  That’s the best way I can describe the glowing light.  This did not have a trail like a real fireball or meteor would.  I am used to watching the sky at night as I often do and when the meteor showers are in duration I actively watch them.  This was not a meteor because of the deep orange color and the lack of trail or tail.  This orb was also moving way to slow to be a meteor or an airplane.  I watched this for about a minute and a half as it appeared to be moving south west.  After watching it for a minute and a half, the orb suddenly blinked out.  Like as if someone had turned off a light with a switch. Just like that it was gone.  I watched for another 10 minutes just to see if anything would come back and it did not. When it disappeared, I started eliminating reasons for its sudden disappearance.  It did not go behind view of any building as it was too high for its location and there was still plenty of room before it would have gone out of view by going behind the apartment building to the east of the one I live in. If I were to guess, if the orb wouldn’t have blinked out and continued at the same speed, it would have been another 3 to 4 minutes before it would have gone out of view behind the building. It also did not go behind the mountain range both because it was heading the wrong direction to do so and it was higher than the highest peak that it was around as I could see the outline of the peak. 	I have had this type of encounter before. It was about a year ago and the orb was directly overhead. It glowed from within just like my encounter a year ago and was the same darker orange in color as the encounter a year ago.  Unfortunately, I was unable to enter a report at that time and no longer know the details as far as time and date.  However, it seemed to be the same type of UFO as then.  I don’t view it as being a meteor or an airplane therefore it is an unidentified flying object in my book. I look forward to hearing what you think at the NUFORC.;40.6980988764044;-112.000386516854
