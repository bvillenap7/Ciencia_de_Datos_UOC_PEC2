Fireball sighting;2012-07-01 22:00:00;4 minutes;Fireball sighting My family and I were outside sitting around our fire pit, enjoying a beautiful, peaceful night.  Our neighbors were lighting fireworks, bottle rockets and such.  Something caught my eye. It appeared to be a big, round, fireball hovering over my garage.   At first I thought maybe it was a firework, but it was pretty big and it just sat there for a minute. I pointed it out to my family who all began to watch the ball of fire.  It hovered above the garage for a minute, then it started moving further away but slowly.   Then it disappeared! Right after that, as we all continued to look into the sky to find it again.  We all saw a very quickly moving star that took off and was traveling at a very fast speed and then also disappeared.  This was not a shooting star!! I have never seen anything quite like it.  All who saw this that night could barley speak. When I saw the increased sightings of fireballs, I had to post this.  We saw one!!  For sure!!

UFO that is bright red round zigzagging light.;2012-07-07 23:15:00;5-6 minutes;UFO that is bright red round zigzagging light. My husband was watching fireworks from our deck.  The fireworks were to the north of our deck toward the horizon.  My husband happened to look up directly above his head and saw a bright, red, round light. He called me to come see it.  I went to the door and looked up and saw the same thing.  We then called my 18 year old daughter and her friend who saw the same thing.  It was not a plane, nor a helicopter, and it made no sound that we could hear.  I thought maybe it could be a meteor, however, it zigzagged slightly, but stayed in the same general area and at about the same altitude. After a few minutes it appeared to get dimmer until it finally disappeared.;40.6980988764044;-112.000386516854

Saw 4-5 reddish lights to the southeast go up from ground level and continue on to the north/northwest while increasing in altitude.  There was a 'flickering' pattern to the lights, almost like one would expect with a Chinese Lantern.  This flickering effect caused some color change between red, yellow and bluish hues.   At first I simply thought these were lanterns, but after thinking about out a while I realized there are some real problems that would likely rule out lanterns.  The most significant problem is that the distance they covered in a relatively short amount of time would indicate that they were traveling at a rate of speed comparable to that of an aircraft at landing speed.   The surface level winds are indeed out of the south at the moment which would explain trajectory but not the speed.  Current surface winds are only at 4mph. The lights traveled in north/northwesterly direction for about 3-5 minutes, eventually ending up due east of my location.  All 4-5 lights eventually dimmed and then disappeared completely as they gained altitude.;40.6980988764044;-112.000386516854
Saw in south sky falling lights.  Looked like a firework but was moving horiz. W to E.  ((NUFORC Note:  Chinese rocket re-entry.  PD));2016-07-27 22:35:00;10-20 seconds;Was droving home in dark.  Saw in south sky falling lights. Looked like a firework but was moving horizontally from right/west to left/east.  2 bright white lights about 1/4 (sky) from each other and a green light all falling together but separated like a comet/asteroid falling in sky.  Saw it fall for approx. 1 minute.  Then got camera out to record another minute then it disappeared.  Like it ran our of flame/light.  This looked like a strange, new, firework but couldn't be rationalized  because of angle, duration and it had NO SOUND!  I have video.  Would love to have it any lied to know what this was.  But can't share on this site due to the rules. I will potentially post this on youtube as a UFO / ASTEROID /COMET in sky of Utah, 7/27/16. ((NUFORC Note:  Chinese rocket re-entry.

At that moment, a cluster of what looked like orange fireworks appeared and were shooting across at a fairly slow speed, and low in the sky.   My husband noticed me looking up and I pointed at it and we both watched it as it glided and either burned out or landed out of out view.  It looked like fiery rain as it disappeared.  Shortly before this occured, the street light on out street burned out for a few minutes leaving the entire street dark and then eventually re-lit.;40.6980988764044;-112.000386516854
