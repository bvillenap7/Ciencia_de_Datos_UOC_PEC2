Black blotch in night sky and blue orb hovering above.;2010-07-24 22:30:00;30 minutes;Black blotch in night sky and blue orb hovering above. My Husband, Grandchild, Grandchilds friend, and I went to Redwood drive inn to see a Movie the last bender and shreck.   During the movie I was looking towards the east in the lower sky.  I spotted a big black blotch bigger then a blimp that kind of blended in the night sky.  I showed my Husband and the Children, we observed the blotch move to the left and back to the right for about 20 minutes.   My Husband went to get Pop corn I could not take my eyes of it and neither could the kids.  As we was watching a blue light flew out of of the blotch and hovered above us for about 4 minutes it appeared to be a blue orb.   We each lit a lighter and tried to get others to look.  The odd thing about it is we dont think anyone noticed it.    All of a sudden it sped off to the west and was gone in the matter of seconds.  I have never seen anything like that.   I dont know if the blue orb was there to take our attention off the black blotch or not but when I looked back to the East the Black blotch was gone.;40.6980988764044;-112.000386516854
