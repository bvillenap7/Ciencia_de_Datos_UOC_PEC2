Black object hovering and changing shape...suddenly vanished.;2012-10-24 07:45:00;5 minutes;Black object hovering and changing shape...suddenly vanished. Saw a black object roughly 15 feet in diameter, about 1000ft high.  Repeatedly changed shape over the course of about 5 minutes.  It went from a perfect circle, to an “eyeball” shape, to a plus sign, to a circle with 5 smaller circles surrounding it.  It was “morphing” at a steady rate.  It was stationary until I got underneath it at which point it moved about 100ft in front of me and matched my pace (walking), continuing to change shape.  It had no definition or lights or sound, just black.  I had to take my eyes off it for about 20 seconds to cross the street and during that time it vanished.;40.6980988764044;-112.000386516854
