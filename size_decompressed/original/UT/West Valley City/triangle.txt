At aproximately 22:15 Friday night. I was outside, in front of my house, talking to my friend. I was standing facing North West, my friend was facing East, and I happened to glance up at the sky. in the direction of the big dipper when I noticed something that appeared almost shadow like in the sky  moving at a high rate of speed. ( to describe what it was like is when you see a flock of geese flying in the night sky. or like what a comet looks like. It was about that transparent.) The object had no lights and was triangular or swept wing. Similar to the stealth bomber.  But I could see through it as it passed in front of the stars as if it was like a ghost. From my vantage point it completely covered the end two stars of the handle of the big dipper. The object made no sound whatsoever. It was moving from North to South. ( I watch the international space station quite often and this object did not appear to be getting any reflective light from the sun) This object  moved from North to South in two to three seconds. I do not know if it was in orbit or in the high atmosphere, or even ten thousand feet. I had no reference point. I turned my head from right to left as I followed it. And as fast as I could turn my head it was gone.  Could this have been something military?  That made no sound?  My friend did not have time to turn his head to see it.  This was the strangest thing I have ever seen.;40.6980988764044;-112.000386516854
Triangular UFO.;2012-08-31 21:00:00;3 minutes;Triangular UFO It was the night of the Blue Moon and I wanted to take some pictures, so I went to my front porch at about 9:00 pm and started taking pictures.  The clouds started to roll in so I couldn't see so well, but kept taking pictures anyway just to see what my camera could pick up.   When I looked at the pictures there was a triangular object near the moon that stayed there for a few minutes of pictures.  It looked like it had perfectly spaced lights around the edges, although it was a little hazy because of the clouds.   I lightened the pictures up and saw the triangle very clearly in every picture I took of the moon.;40.6980988764044;-112.000386516854
