Object appears in the same region of the sky 2 evenings in a row.;2015-06-20 21:00:00;10 minutes;Object appears in the same region of the sky 2 evenings in a row. I first noticed an object at about 9:38 PM, Friday, June 19, 2015.  This object was about the size of the ISS and was brightly lit by solar reflection.   I watched it for some time, it was moving from south west to north east.  It looked like 3 balloons tied together in a triangular pattern.   Skip to 9:00PM Saturday, June 20, 2015.  I was talking to my neighbor and he was showing me a bright star to the west of the Moon.  I told him that I had seen something that was strange looking the night before and pointed to the region in the sky where I had seen the object the night before.  Low and behold the same object was was in the sky as the night before and in the same general location.   The object was still visible as the sun had just set.  It looked like 3 balloons tied together in a triangular pattern.  But there was a reflection from the sun reflecting off something at the top of the uppermost ballon.    Size:  From my vantage point the size of the 3 connected objects appeared to be as large as the diameter of the fuselage of a commercial jet.  If you were to look at a map of the Salt Lake City Valley, I would have seen the object directly over the Murray region.  The object was relatively stationary for about 5 minutes, then it traveled west south west until it was in the direct path of jets on final approach to SL International Airport.   Then it appeared to climb in elevation from what appeared to be about 20,000 feet until it disappeared straight upward out of sight moving directly southward over Camp Williams.  The path was in a slow S pattern.  but the strange thing is the same object was in the sky 2 days in a row.  Military drone of some kind???????????;40.6980988764044;-112.000386516854
