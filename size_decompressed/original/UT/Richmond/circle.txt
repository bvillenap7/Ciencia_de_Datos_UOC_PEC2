Large stationary object in the atmosphere reflected by the sun.;2017-08-12 19:00:00;2  hours;Large stationary object in the atmosphere reflected by the sun. Large circular object in the sky.  I noticed a circular object in the sky that looked a lot like a star, but it was too early for a star to shine that bright.  The sun was reflecting off of it, and when dusk came, the object slowly dimmed, until I could not see it anymore.   Did not move at all the entire time it was visible.   It was positioned to the southeast of Richmond Ut.  I've seen the space station pass before, and satellites, but never something that is stationary for that long at that height, and that big.   Took a video for about 2 minutes, when I first saw it around 8:30 at night.;41.9307;-111.8035
