Multiple unidentified objects in the sky.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-12 09:00:00;20 minutes +;Multiple unidentified objects in the sky. Strange things happing in the sky tonight.  My son was sitting in the hot tub with his girlfriend and about 40 lights in the sky were heading from the south to the north.  Not terribly close together, but a steady stream.  They were almost overhead, maybe a little to the east.  One of the lights veered off to the west at a high rate of speed.  No jet propulsion sound and not terribly bright but very noticeable.  They also were not equidistant in relation to each other.  A few more came a little later and when almost overhead they disappeared as traveling up.;40.6197;-111.8049
