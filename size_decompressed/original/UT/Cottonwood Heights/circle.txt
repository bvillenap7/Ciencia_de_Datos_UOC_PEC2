Unusual object over Wasatch Front Range.;2009-05-28 21:15:00;3 mins.;Unusual object over Wasatch Front Range. While on my front lawn just after dusk I saw a very bright object moving from west to east over the Wasatch Front Range.  The only reason I paid attention to it is because The object appeared to have unusally bright landing lights.  It is then that I realized that they could not be landing lights because the craft was moving away not towards me. I have been an airline pilot for the last 12 years and this was like nothing I have seen in my experience. I just felt like I should tell someone and your web site came up on Google. I appologize, but I would rather not give my name. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.6197;-111.8049
