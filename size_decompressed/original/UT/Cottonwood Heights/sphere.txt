A  bright sphere like object that appeared out of nowhere.;2010-08-25 22:06:00;5 minutes;A  bright sphere like object that appeared out of nowhere. Approximate time was 10.06 pm. I was looking at the eastern sky were i look every night.  Usually satellites shine bright then fade out in a line.  But this object appeared brightly out of nowhere, but instead of fading out it went really slow from the eastern sky north bound.  I looked thru my binoculars at it and realized it did not look like a airplane and made no sound that i could hear.   So i went upstairs to tell my friend, but when i went back outside i saw it heading east out of sight over the wasatch mountains. ((NUFORC Note:  Date not indicated by the source of the report.

Bright purple sphere hovering over the I-215 East Freeway in Salt Lake City, UT.;2015-01-21 21:30:00;2 minutes;Bright purple sphere hovering over the I-215 East Freeway in Salt Lake City, UT. I was driving East on I-215 and just before Highland Drive and I witnessed a round orb hovering over the freeway.  It was unlike anything I have ever seen before.  The center was colorless.  It was surrounded by a very bright purplish glow that stood out like a sore thumb.   My initial reaction was WTF is that!  It was not a plane or helicopter.  The light surrounding it was solid and did not flash.  I was able to see it for about a minute before it went out of view behind my car.  I then watched my review mirrors and was able to catch one more glance in the mirror.  It was hard to tell the size or how high it was.  It seemed much lower altitude than a plane would fly.   The sky is very clear tonight.  I can see more stars than usual.  There is no wind or any other weather factors tonight.;40.6197;-111.8049
