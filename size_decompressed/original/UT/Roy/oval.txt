UFO over Northern Utah/Hill Air Force Base;2003-06-29 17:50:00;30 min;UFO over Northern Utah/Hill Air Force Base Had an interesting experience yesterday (06/29/03) between 5:00p -- 6:00p.  We were having a family gathering in our backyard in Roy, Utah and my Son-in-Law pointed out an object in the sky.  It was pretty high, I assume because, with the naked eye, it was about the size of a pencil eraser.  The rest of the family search the sky a spotted the object.  Watching it, it looked like it was heading toward the ground, because it looked like it was getting larger.  Then it stopped and hung there for about 5 minutes.  Then the object slowly began moving North-Northeast.  I looked away and my son exclaimed Hey! it just divided in two.  So I looked up again and I spotted the two objects.  The second just accelerated really fast and flew off in a South-Southwesterly direction and disappeared behind our trees.  We continued watching the first object, then suddenly the second returned with equal velocity flying in the North-Northeasterly direction catching up to the first.  The first still traveling slowly North-Northeasterly.  The second object then changed direction and flew off South-Southeasterly at a high rate of speed then disappeared.  I looked back to the first object and watched it for a few more minutes then it, too, disappeared.  The objects appeared round or oval, I thought they may have had wings but I cannot be sure.  It was either white or silver-reflecting-sunlight.  The display lasted about a half-hour, 45 minutes.  There were three of us watching the whole time, and four other watched for a few minutes;41.1685;-112.0361
