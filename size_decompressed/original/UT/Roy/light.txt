6 lights in a random pattern over Roy, Utah.;2014-12-30 20:55:00;4-5 minutes;6 lights in a random pattern over Roy, Utah. I returned from the store and saw several orange lights in the sky above Roy, UT, driving Westbound on 4800 South at 3700 West.  I stopped and watched them for a couple of minutes, before heading home.   I watched them the entire way as they were headed towards HAFB in a zigzag course and by the time I arrived home they had changed course and headed West.  I entered the house and told my wife to come outside and see them.  Together we watched for a couple more minutes as they flew West.   The lights went out one by one until they were gone.  There was no cloud cover as I was able to see stars in the sky as well as the lights.  The lights were changing from red to orange and then purple.;41.1685;-112.0361
