Very bight light flashes across night sky.;2004-12-16 23:50:00;5 seconds;Very bight light flashes across night sky. I was driving down the road in west Roy when all of a sudden a bright amber light flew over the road.  It startled me because it was the same color and about the same size as the streetlights above.   It flew about 2 or 3 miles ahead of me in about 1 second then it slowed down, turned a bright green color and then just disappeared.   It couldn't have been a meteor because it actually slowed to an almost complete stop.  It also didn't leave any type of trail or break apart in any way.   I've lived near Hill AFB all of my life and have never seen anything like this.;41.1685;-112.0361
