It was blinking. It moved slowly. It fadded in and out and changed color. Looked like a maple leaf that was on fire. The way it was moving it looked like a kaledioscope. Mw and my wife were taking a walk when I noticed a bright light over the Great Salt Lake. It was moving to slow to be a plane and it was not a planet because of how close it was. It moved very slowly. It looked like a maple leaf that was on fire. It was a bright blue in the center, then a white, and finally a red on the edges. It also appeared to spin. It would fade in and out. It dissappeared for about ten minutes. After I got home I woke my son up and had him look at it then I got two of our neighbors. About fifteen minutes later it dissappeared. Me and my wife listen to Art Bell just about every night.;41.1685;-112.0361
