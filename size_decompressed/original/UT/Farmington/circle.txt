I was getting ready for the day, when I looked outside and saw a patch of sky on the western horizon that was bright as day, but the sun was still behind the mountains so it was dark everywhere else.  Then I saw a black, perfectly round orb, about the size of a dime from my perspective move across the sky.  It was only visible for about 10 seconds.;40.9927;-111.889
