I was unable to see this examples;2001-07-28 03:00:00;25/30 minutes;I was unable to see this examples It was approximatly 2:30/3:00 A.M. I awakened, needing to use the bathroom.  The bedroom was luminated from a bright light outsid of the East window of the bedroom.  Looking out I saw two very bright lights in a dark, cloudless sky.  I went in the the bathroom, completed my errand and went back to the window.  The lights were still there.  I did not know if anyone would believe me and did not wish to wake my sleeping husband.  I went into the livingroom closet and got the camera, went back to the bedroom and took a picture from the window, with the telescopic lens set to infinity. The lights were still there and had not moved.  I then returned the camera to its place in the closet and went back to the window.  The lights were still there and i wend to bed.  I thought I may here of something the next day on the news. I asked my husband if he had gotten up during the night but he had not. I forgot about the incident after a couple of days and did not think about it until I finally had the roll of film developed a couple of months later.  There was a picture of what I had thought a flying saucer looked like.  Two of them.  I showed the picture to my family and friends to see if they thought the same thing and without exception they all thought it looked like saucers.  I did not know where or who to report it to so just put it away until I heard the locak noon news today on CBS ( Channel 2). They were interviewing a lady named ((name deleted))  who said she was expecting her brothers and sisters to drop in on Salt Lake City for an Olympic visit. I thought it was more Olympic hipe until she said she had seen saucers in July 2001. This is when I thought I should report my sighting to someone.  If this is interesting to you I have photo and negative.  I do not however have a scanner. I am leaving for a month to care for my father on Feb.28 and will be back on April 4, 2002.if you are interested you can contact me then.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
