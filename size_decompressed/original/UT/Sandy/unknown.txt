All activity was east of my location in Sandy, UT., and flights were over the Wasatch mountains. I saw an object of undetermined size flying north above the mountains much higher than any type of plane I am aware of. As I was watching the northbound light another light  appeared traveling East to West and appeared to be on a collision course and both units maneuvered at this point seemingly to avoid the west bound light. The West bound light extinguished shortly thereafter. The north bound light continued North and covered incredible distance in a short amount of time. I continued to watch the sky and another light headed from South to North. I saw one more after this that was not as bright and moved rapidly from South to North. I watch this area of sky frequently and this was an exceptionally unique occurance. I would be interested in contact by email if! this a typical sighting or what you may think about it.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
Incredible moving lights in the sky;2011-08-30 21:00:00;1 hour;Incredible moving lights in the sky Two nights in a row over salt lake city we have seen very strange objects in the sky.  The best way I can discribe it a circular shape of light and a stream of light that looks to he hanging below.  Flashes of color (red and green) can be seen at times.  They hover without hardly moving.   Last night my husband ((name deleted)) to convience me it was an odd looking star, but then it began to move (he lost it and startedjumping up and down).  It looked as if it went thru the atmosphere because the light dimmed and disappeared.  It was moveing extremely fast.   I know we can't be the only ones that saw this.  Incredible!!;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327

Solid light same brightness as stars high in atmosphere or space moving north to south across Utah.;2021-03-04 20:18:00;2 minutes;Solid light same brightness as stars high in atmosphere or space moving north to south across Utah. It was a clear night sky and I could see multiple stars. I saw a point of light about the same brightness as the surrounding stars but I noticed it was moving relative to the stars. From north north east to south southwest. It's speed appeared similar to a satellite and it was clearly far away but also very bright relatively. Once it reached about a 45 degree angle from my perspective it was no longer visible. It was a smooth flyby at a constant pace but how do I confirm if it was a satellite? Photos I have are interesting. They all show 3 points of light for this object. Could be from the image processing its movement but I don't know.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
