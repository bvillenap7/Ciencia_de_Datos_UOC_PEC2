Bright flash that seemed to be expanding from a moving light source.;2009-11-18 00:21:00;4-5 seconds;Bright flash that seemed to be expanding from a moving light source. My wife and I had gone up in the kitchen to get a snack and I was finishing a glass of water and we both jumped when the whole back yard and neighbors back yard lit up like there was a spot light shinning from up above the houses. It was a flash and almost like a bright burst that seemed to illuminate over the houses.  It really scared my wife and me. I went out side to see a bright light above Little Cottonwood Canyon then 2 aircraft came over the range and seemed to be moving at a high rate of speed in a southwestern direction.   We continued to observe for a bit and then decided to go back in the house. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
