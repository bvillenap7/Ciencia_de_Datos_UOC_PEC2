I looked up and heading North to South over the valley were 15-20 redish orangish lights. I t was a partially cloudy night and they were above the clouds.  They stuck together moving in formation, but were weaving in and out of each other in a pattern that looked like the greek lower case lambda symbol.  It was like watching synchronized swimmers as they changed position so the formation changed shape, all the while maintaining the same speed and direction.   I'd say it/they stayed visable for a min as they passed out of sight into the clouds to the south. Strangest thing I've ever seen.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
