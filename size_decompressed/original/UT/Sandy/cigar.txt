Cigar-shaped object hovering over mountains East of Sandy, UT;2016-08-08 20:12:00;~5-6 minutes;Cigar-shaped object hovering over mountains East of Sandy, UT My friend & I witnessed a white, cigar-shaped object that hovered over the high Wasatch mountains east of Sandy, UT.  It hovered, motionless, then moved (slowly) north.  It stopped & started, moving slowly, before appearing to drop behind the mountains (into what is a wilderness area).  No sound.  No wings.  No lights (even though at the brink of night).  Not moving--until it did.  When it turned, the setting sun glinted, briefly, off the object.  From our vantage point, the object was about the size of a very large grain of rice.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
