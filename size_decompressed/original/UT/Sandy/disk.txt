The object we saw was too big and too high to be a drone. It was staying still so it wasn’t a plane or helicopter either.  It blinked green, purple, and red lights and flew quickly around in a large circle.  Then it shot up even higher and started flashing on and off.  Then the lights stayed red. After that we saw a second smaller object flying near it with red lights, also too high to be a drone.  It started looking like it flew sideways and then it had a line of lights that started flashing on and off in a row.  It still hasn’t flown away.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
