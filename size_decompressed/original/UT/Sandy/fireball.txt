Group of 20 orange fireballs hovering and moving across wind-less night sky, silently.;2012-08-14 21:15:00;20 minutes;group of 20 orange &quotfireballs&quot hovering and moving across wind-less night sky, silently. My husband and I noticed a bright orange &quotfireball&quot about 2000 ft in the sky, realized it was not moving but hovering, then 2 more suddenly appeared near it. They formed a triangular shape. We had seen same on Christmas eve 2011 at 11pm.  We got excited at seeing it agaun and grabbed binoculars, looking through them at one it looked to have white lites around circumference, then he said &quotlook, more are coming&quot and I saw 6 more comung from behind east mountains in a line, moving, then forming groups of 3 in triangular shapes then separating and moving on toward southwest. More kept coming every few seconds, steadily,. Within 20 minutes or so we saw about 20, as they glided off we lost them in the tree line. They were silent, orange, with the white lites visible on some lower ones, through the binoculars.  No wind or even breeze, no aircraft like helicopters. when all had gone we ran inside to check the news but all night no report, none sinc! e. I googled and found tond of similar, even in Moscow. It made it creepier that these lights are being seen all over, with same descriptions and same videos of what we saw.  The forming of triangular groups is why my husband doesn't believe it is Chinese lanterns.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327

I grabed my android phone and ran out to climb on the roof.  I recorded the triad, a pair and a single before memory ran out.  Assended rapidly from corner canyon draper near the temple headed west nw the triad changed direction several times and two took of southwest from over riverton the third held steady until the pair started up.  They traved about 10 miles in less than a minute befor taking off and disapearing to toward ceader fort or southwest.  I called out to some niegbors who just pulled into their drive and they saw one, and there were several kids in the yard behind me that saw them as well.  I used to rappell forest fires.. these were not any sort of helicopter or fixed wing air craft.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
Four orbs in the sky.;2017-01-05 22:15:00;7 minutes;Four orbs in the sky. I was out working looked up in the sky as normal.  I saw what I that was plane or something.  Then realized there was no blinking lights.  Also our planes come from the South or South West.  These were coming from the East mountains.   I then took out my cell phone and started recording.  My camera quality was poor so it did not capture what I was seeing.  The colors red, orange, and purple. The orbs started off low then went higher.  They all went south then out of camera view the shot up out of sight.  I uploaded the video to youtube.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
