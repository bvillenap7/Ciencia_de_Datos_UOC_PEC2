Sometime during the 1st half of gameplay,  I started to notice people all over the stadium continuously gaze up at the clear, blue sky but there was no fireworks yet.  It was the 4th of July, & the Blue Angels had already flown over the stadium before the game started.  So, out of curiosity I look up, & lo & behold-I see a u.f.o. that looks like a dark-shaded, upside down Bowser shell the size of an airplane carrier basically hovering hundreds of feet above the freeway, but going 10-30 mph.  If you were in that stadium, you saw it.  From players, to the fans on the other side of the crowd.  I have get to find any video footage of what i witnessed that day.  It went directly over Rio Tinto, & it was probably the 3rd quarter when it had passed by & continued floating east.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
4 orange and 1 red orb filmed assending one at a time and taking off over mtn in Utah.;2012-11-22 19:15:00;10 minutes;4 orange and 1 red orb filmed assending one at a time and taking off over mtn in Utah. Driving home from turkey dinner, I noticed the first and imeadiatly pulled into a vacent lot to view.  I exited my car and my friend stayed in.  Immediatley I pulled my phone for video.  The first orb was fading in the distance by then.  A second orb rose over the trees and asccended over the ridge.  And as it fadded, another apearred due east of us and lifted from the base of the mountain, ascending about 5000 feet as it cleared the sw ridge of Lone peak and took off SE towards Heaber or Mt Timpanogoos.  The pattern repeated, one took off out of sight, another would start up from the mtn base.  the last one was red and appeared before its predacessor took off out of sight.  About 50 cars passed us, one pulled over to watch and question us. The weather was very calm,  95% clarity, less than .25 mph from north and cooling rapidly.  Objects assenended appx. 5000ft verticle and 3 miles distance before accelerating away in less than 2 minutes.   Objects were very luminous,  apearing to light up snow on the mtn as they passed over (500 ft above).  We heard no sound from them.  They apeared to bounce and shimmer and change direction some as they assended.  Possibly spinning cuboids on an axis?  Brassy orange with purple blue shard/fingers of  light flashing offand forming an aparent auroa.  They did not apear to come from the exact same. Location, but started from w/in 1/4 mile of each other and followed simmillar but not exact path/speed. The last was very red, brighter and moved faster than the orange ones.  My friend saw them as humanoid in form and concures with my observation otherwise.  The objects were appx 1 mile from my location when they lifted from the toe of the mtn.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
Triangular and diamond shaped light formations.;2013-11-08 01:00:00;10;Triangular and diamond shaped light formations. I first saw two objects that appeared to be satilites.  They both were headed Southeast from the general direction of snowbird ski resort.  Keep in mind they looked like satilites and were nearly directly straight up from my location.  I lost interest and called my dogs. I looked up again as small patch of clouds covered the leading satilite.  On the other side of the cloud I saw more lights moving along the same path in a south east direction.  Once all the objects cleared the cloud the satilites were in a triangular formation.  The triangle was equilateral. In the middle of each flat of the triangle there was a satilite.  So in all there were six satilites, three at each point and one dividing each flat.  I believe this formation was in orbit and not in the atomosphere.  The formations size is unknown. But judging from the distance I would say the object had a base length of twenty miles and each leg was twenty miles.  Taking into account my visual angle the object ! took up a relatively small patch of sky.  After observing the object for a time I noticed a diamond moving with it and directly ahead of it.  Each point of the diamond had a light/ satilite at each point.  Two satilites trailed it waving back and forth like a tail.  This object appeared to have a light mist on its interior.  The second formation was about an 1/8 the size of the delta. I second guessed that the clouds moving may have tricked my eyes.  Possibly these were star formations and the clouds moving Northeast made them appear to be moving.  Upon thinking this I noticed the formations moving relative to the stars and the stars didn't pass through them.  The speed of the formations was slow but fast enough to cover the 50% of the sky I observed it move through before disappearing behind a cloud front.  I am in the aviation industry and I know that aircraft have green lights on right wing, red on the left and white on the tail.  All the lights were white. The size and behavior o! f these objects is unlike anything I've seen.  The videos I too! k didn't show up.  Grab a camera don't use your iphone.  I can send an image if you think you can fix it.  It's just black screen;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
Unexplained Impact Rumble;2017-01-13 12:32:00;2 seconds;Unexplained Impact Rumble A very loud rumble. Unexplained. No weather could of caused it.  As it rumbled, my window was closed but there is a slight draft seeping through, not enough to cause movement today there is no wind.  My heavy curtain moved as it were a shock wave of air as it rumbled.  Sort of like it were an impact of sorts.  But did not see anything.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
