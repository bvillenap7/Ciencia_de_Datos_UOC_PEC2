Unidentified flying objects Investigations;1980-10-15 14:00:00;1min.;Unidentified flying objects Investigations                                                                                                        October 22 2010        I want to report an event that occurred in 1980 or 81     I have lived at this address since 1978.. I am 71 years of age ,.I worked in the used heavy truck, construction sales business. Self employed for 20 years. Retired in 2000. As I send this out for the public, I am aware that many will think me a nut. I think that some of the information  that I learned from this event ,may be of some importance some day .there was some snow on the ground .  This incident occurred at my home. The time of year was either early spring or late fall. I do not remember for sure..  I was setting in a lazy boy reclines watching TV.,. The chair was next to a sliding glass door situated about a foot or so from my right. I noticed something in the air outside, and turned to look. An orange ball of what looked like fire was falling down towards my neighbors roof. It was about the size of a golf ball even a little larger. My neighbors house is about 60’ behind mine, there is a 6’ grape stake fence around the back yard. Bushes against the fence half way up on my side.  Between the bushes and patio landscaping is about 50’ of lawn. The patio landscaping rose  about four foot at that time. The patio is connected to the house and is 15’ deep,the patio is next to sliding glass doors, where I was setting.  Page 2   Now here is the strange stuff. The ball was falling at a speed  less than is a falling stone. Quite a bit less, or so it seemed. It stopped falling about a foot above the roof.  The object turned directly towards the patio doors. It followed the contour of the roof staying a perfect foot or so from the roof. Traveling horizontally. It dropped down behind the fence. I lost sight of it. Then it suddenly  It appeared at the top of the fence, staying about a foot from the top. Then dropped to the lawn, continued across the lawn, again at about a foot. Traveling fast straight toward the patio doors. It raised up and over the patio landscaping,  again at an exact distance from whatever was underneath it. across the patio and smacked  hard into the glass door. It left a mark on the glass door that looked like a large cherry bomb fire cracker would leave, dark to medium black in color It all happened in seconds, I seen it hit, and jumped up, thinking the glass would shatter. After hitting it actually stopped in mid air for just a second, then turned a pale yellow.  It returned in an exact reversal of direction, traveling back over all the ground objects at the same level. It reminded me of a toy train reversing direction. It traveled to the spot on the roof then straight up, it’s speed diminished. It reminded me of a hurt animal, though it  was not animal.  , It climbed a bit the! n the fire was out .I am not sure of this ,but I  think I seen some smaller fall. As I was not on good  terms with that neighbor, I did not think  telling him I seen a  small object fall to his roof. There was snow on the roof and I looked but could see nothing.      The object was solid, from the sound of the hit , It was about the density of a rock.\  The fire seemed to come out about a quarter of an inch or less. It left no smoke trail. the fire came out all around  the object.  It was obviously guided. Important  It’s guidance could not detect glass. I think this is important.  The residue it left seemed to about like a fire cracker.  I still have the  door it hit.  I think this stuff is important ,because a lot of people see fire balls. This tells something about them.       ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the source of the report does not indicate that fact.  PD));40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
silver/gray sphere moving silently east to west over Sandy, Utah;2003-09-16 13:00:00;5 seconds;silver/gray sphere moving silently east to west over Sandy, Utah I am from  NC and was in Utah working on the exterior of a house.  When I looked up at the side of the house, I noticed a round object moving across the sky at a high rate of speed.  I looked up to watch the sphere, which was a silver/gray color. At first I thought it was perhaps a balloon.  It moved so quickly overhead that I had to turn around to try to follow it. When I turned around, I lost sight of the object and was not able to locate it again.  There was no sound.  The sky was clear, with no clouds.  I still thought that it might be some kind of a balloon, but I checked the directions and discovered that the object had traveled from east to west.  I have never seen anything like this before personally, but it appeared to be the same type of object I once saw on TV which had appeared over Mexico City.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327

Orange round non-helicopter;2013-07-25 21:30:00;5 minutes;Orange round non-helicopter On my walk home this evening at about 9:30 pm I seen what at first I thought was a helicopter.  However, it was round on shape, orangeish/red with a white halo around it,  it didn't make a sound and moved alot slower.   So obviously it was no round helicopter and I believe it to be ufoish.    It started at the mouth of little cottonwood canyon and hovered just below the ridge line of the mountains where it ended at the point of the mountain above draper when it blinked 3times then disappeared.  Even my kids seen it and said look mommy it's an orange airplane.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
3 to 4 red spheres at a time, flying, hovering, and disappearing over 10 minute span.;2014-01-19 18:00:00;10 minutes;3 to 4 red spheres at a time, flying, hovering, and disappearing over 10 minute span. Driving to my current lodging in Sandy, Utah, around sunset, I noticed 3 red spheres in the south eastern sky, maybe close to Spanish Fork Utah, around 20 or 30 miles from my location.  They moved slowly west, and disappeared one by one. Then, just like gigantic Roman Candles, three more red spheres shot up in an instant, and stopped at what appeared to be around 4 or 5,000 feet. They also hovered in random patterns and disappeared.  This same action continued for at least 5 minutes.  I recorded as much as I could on my phone.  Did anyone else see this?;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
