Orange lights sighted over Salt Lake Valley.;2012-05-01 21:30:00;3 minutes;Orange lights sighted over Salt Lake Valley. On the evening of Tuesday, May 1, 2012 at approximately  9.30 p.m. I and my partner witnessed an series of large orange lights that appeared over  the Wasatch mountains east of Sandy, Utah. Our home is oriented toward the east side of the Salt Lake Valley.  We have an unobstructed view of the Wasatch Mountains from our home.  On Tuesday evening my partner called down to me to look out the kitchen window.  I turned off the kitchen light and looked out out the down stairs kitchen window.  I saw three large orange lights moving from over Big Cottonwood Canyon from east to west. I ran upstairs and went into the backyard to get a better look.  My partner stood on the balcony and witnessed the same event.  I saw three and then two additional orange lights moving from the east to the west.  I yelled at my partner to grab the binoculars in the hall closet.  The objects were moving fast and I ran through the house and out into the front yard.  The objects continued to move over the house toward the west.  I ran to the neighbors house and rang their door bell.  My neighbor came outside and by that time, two minutes, the objects were gone.  My partner who had remained in the back yard said that they had turned south.  We have a stand of large pine trees on the south side of the property so I was unable to see the objects turn.  I had assumed they just disappeared. The objects were 3x larger than Venus.  They were bright orange in color and circular in shape.  They appeared to be traveling in a straight line from east to west.  I personally saw five orange objects, while my partner saw at least eight.  The entire event could not have lasted more than four minutes.  The time involved my have been even less. We had a few cocktails earlier before dinner but this is something that I had never seen before and I will never forget!   I called the local channel 2 (ABC) television station and asked if there had been any reports of lights over Sandy, Utah.  He said no, that I was the only person who had reported any lights.  I know what I saw and this was not a normal event!;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
