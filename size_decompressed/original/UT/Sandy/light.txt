Bright blue light against a blue cloudless sky, at high noon.;1996-08-01 12:00:00;5 minutes;Bright blue light against a blue cloudless sky, at high noon. I am sending in this report because I saw a very similar report filed by a person in 4/03, which seemed to be very uniqe and identical to what my son and I saw.  At exactly high noon on 08/01/96 my son, who was 17 at the time, came running downstairs wanting to know if I wanted to see a UFO.  I said, sure, Matt, as I had never seen one before.  By the time I got into our front yard, I saw Matt pointing up in the sky due south of Sandy, Utah, a suburb located south of Salt Lake City.  Matt's eyes were bugging out, and his arm pointed up at a bright blue light.  The weather was perfectly clear without a cloud in the sky, so this extremely bright, blue light was against a blue backround, but it was so bright it was easily observable.  It was the size of a pea if you held it out at arms length, and it appeared to be extremely high, although there were no reference points so it was hard to tell.  It was hovering, completely still.  All of a sudden, it started to come down at an astonishing speed, coming down in 45 degree angles, coming down in the shape of a Christmas tree.  Try to imagine the light coming down in the shape of ZZZZ stacked vertically.  It seemed to go from what could have been an altitude of 100,000 feet to approximately ground level in under five seconds, something no plane I have ever seen could do.  After being just above the ground for several seconds, it jetted back up to an extremely high altitude at a straight 45 degree angle, and just hovered.  At that time, I was standing in our front yard pointing up with my eyes bugging out.  The blue light hovered still for about two minutes.  I was so shocked, finally I told Matt to go in and get a pair of binocs.  However, before he could come back out, the blue light started to travel south, at a leisurely pace, due south over what may have been the town of Lehi, north of Provo, Utah.  Later that evening, my son and I went to a movie, and a child three rows in front of us pointed up at the ceiling, then made motions with his ! finger, imitating EXACTLY the flight pattern of this thing to his father.  So, obviously he saw it.  Unfortunately, I did not tell his father that we had seen exactly the same thing.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
Patriotic.  From white, to red, to blue.;2001-05-24 22:21:00;20-30 seconds;Patriotic.  From white, to red, to blue. We were stargazing, and I happened to look towards the south.  There were three what I thought were three stars, or satellites in a perfect equalateral triangle, when lo and behold one of the triangular points of light leaves the triangle and starts heading to the north.  I pointed it out to my friend, it looked like a medium bright star.  Then, all of a sudden, it became a very bright white light...my friend said, Hey, that satellite just winked at us!  Then, it turned from a bright white color, to a very ruddy, rusty red color.  Then, it went from rusty red, to a strange blue color...from blue back to that weird red color.  It seemed to be going about the same speed across the sky as a satellite, and kept a very straight course.  Eventually, it looked like it was getting even higher (it looked damn high to begin with), until it eventually disappeared from sight.  It was a nice, colorful show.  Can satellites do this?  I have never seen one that could go from white to red to blue before.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
Three non-blinking stars moving across the sky from south to north in eastern part of sky at 4:25 a.m.;2002-05-15 04:25:00;1 minute +;Three non-blinking stars moving across the sky from south to north in eastern part of sky at 4:25 a.m. I observed a star moving across the sky from south to north. It did not seem to be twinkling and moved in a steady path and speed.  It faded out when in got to the Little Dipper (from my perspective).  I looked back to where it had come from and saw two stars moving in generally the same direction. They were not moving parallel to each other, more in a slight v, so I was unable to watch them both.  I focussed on the brigher one until it disappeared close to the Little Dipper. I glanced across the sky but could not see the third one. I waited for about ten more minutes looking south but no more moving stars. I would not have thought that much about a moving star but three really caught my attention. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness may have witnessed a cluster of satellites, perhaps the three which are seen to fly in formation over several weeks, and which are thought possibly to be part of the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellite system.  PD));40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
I saw an unusual falling star.;2002-07-11 01:00:00;3 seconds(e);I saw an unusual falling star. I saw what could have been a falling star but it didn't act like any falling star I have seen before.  It appeared like any falling star but there was no streaking, the light was more substantial (like an unblinking airplane light) and though it was moving fast it was not as fast and fleeting as falling stars seem to be.  Also, it didn't vanish in the middle of the sky.  Instead, the light stayed consistant and seemed to fall behind the Wasatch Mountains in the east. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else saw this and if it was a meteor or whatever.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
Bright flashing lights highly visisble from several miles away, stationary, wrong colors for helicopters.;2012-01-04 20:35:00;20 min;Bright flashing lights highly visisble from several miles away, stationary, wrong colors for helicopters. Two objects seen east appeared to rise up over Wasatch mountains.  Thought the objects were rescue helicopters.  Objects rose up to level higher than I would expect helicopters to be able to hover.  When looking through binoculars the objects were flashing red, green, white, and purple.  Object remained stationary in sky for at least 20 minutes.  Unable to make out exact shape from distance.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327

tons of lights flying across sky in Utah.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-16 22:05:00;30 minutes;tons of lights flying across sky in Utah Wife and I are in hot tub and lights flying North! We thought it was a satellite.  They are still going.  Roughly 20 so far and all continuing in a straight line. Some are stopping and turning now. Cannot be this many satellites.  Some seem brighter than others.  One just disappeared completely.  Thinking these must be ufoâ€™s.  They appear to be in a circle now across the sky coming in a path.  This is weird!!  Came from West to East according to the wife!;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
A object presenting characteristics that are not consistent with the SpaceX satellite formation.;2021-05-27 22:20:00;2 minutes;A object presenting characteristics that are not consistent with the SpaceX satellite formation. It was 10:20 at night going down a little cottonwood canyon on a bicycle in Sandy Utah. We were in the area behind Albion Middle School that's forested on a good view. We looked up and were immediately taken back by what appeared to both of us a large object to be a very large skinny object. I quoted after that that thing had to be a mile or too long. I can't remember now because the moment has passed at the time however I was very convinced that there was an object in the sky between 2500 and 20,000 ft in the air. The object went across the sky very quickly appearing to be thousands of miles an hour consistent with the SpaceX satellite. Although after it went overhead it vanished within 2 seconds every single light just absolutely disappeared. I find that strange because SpaceX satellites I imagine wouldn't just vanish and you can clearly see them vanishing at the last second or two of the video. Within probably 5 seconds of the video ending The! video is exactly 1 minute long because that's the maximum Snapchat limit. In the video footage the biggest inconsistency with anything rational is at the 8 second mark there is a large flash that would have to be huge if it was in space right next to this formation. The odds of an object re-entering the atmosphere and looking like the way it does on film seems very small. So I checked for potential rational explanations as to what I have seen and filmed and they are saying that there was SpaceX satellites over salt lake City around the time we saw it. I am basically looking for a rational explanation to what that light is at the 8 second mark. Even though I may or may not have seen something more. I uploaded the video to YouTube because I didn't know where else to put it So there it is thank you for your time please look at what I'm looking at and see if you can explain it. https://youtu.be/wrshMqQ7Q9w;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
