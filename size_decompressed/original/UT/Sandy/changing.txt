I was looking south at the planet Jupiter and my wife was facing me looking north. We were in front of our yard on the porch. This happened around 10pm I saw 3 lights that looked like stars in a straight line. It struck me as odd as they were really close to one another but in a straight lined with Jupiter. I told my wife to turn her head around and look but she was in a lower chair and couldn't get turned around to see at that moment. At that moment I saw them move very quickly into a Triangle pattern and hold that position for roughly 15-20 seconds. I got excited at that point, This finally convinced my wife to get out of the chair and look up. She saw the patterns but wasn't sure, She just thought they were stars until they one by one disappeared. At that point I had raised my voice in excitement that my neighbor who was out walking her dog and my younger teenage daughter who was downstairs in the living room heard my voice and came out to see what was go! ing on. It was really crazy but exciting.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
