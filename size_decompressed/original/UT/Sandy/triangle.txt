A triangular black object with four lights on it flew about 50-100 feet above my home.;1999-07-25 20:30:00;About 1 1/2 minutes;A triangular black object with four lights on it flew about 50-100 feet above my home. It was a black triangular object with rounded corners. It had three white lights-one at each corner-and a blinking red in the center. The center light took about two seconds to blink each time. It was flying low, about 50-100 feet above my house, but I heard no sound. I ran inside to tell someone, but by the time I got back outside, it was gone. It was probably about 25-50 feet between corners. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327

Caught in binoculars:  two glowing triangles cruising in formation in silence;2000-07-27 22:48:00;5-6 seconds;Caught in binoculars:  two glowing triangles cruising in formation in silence I am a skeptic and still think there is some explanation of what I saw. I was laying down on a bench in the backyard with my feet twards the west. I was looking through my binoculars approximately 15 degrees SW from the star Vega (My hobby is star gazing). Suddenly right through the center of my view though the binos, I saw what I thought was a large satellite. I followed the object to examine the details. There were 2 triangular shaped objects in formation one following the other. It crossed the sky in a steady pace. Much faster than a jet, but slower than a meteorite. What shocked me was that when it crossed a patch of clouds, it was on this side of the clouds! I could see its shape much clearer against the cloud. It had a dim orange-yellow glow twards the center and they were not more than 50 feet apart from each other. It countinued in a straight and steady course dead silent from south east twards the north west. It looked like two F-14 with the wings retracted. F-14 are loud. I waited for a sonic boom but heard nothing. After about 5 or 6 seconds I took the binoculars off of them I couldn't see it anymore. A lot of things crossed my mind as to what it May have been. From birds to fireballs. But birds don't glow and don't cruise at that speed. Plus, I know a bird when I see one. These were definite triangular shaped, no wings. Fireball or low flying meteors? But with no flash or tail, in formation, at a satellite's pace, under the clouds. The clouds were altocumulus. I looked at my watch and noted that it was 10:48pm Anybody else witness this? This was Very strange.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
Triangular shaped, with an extremely white light all the way around it's borders.;2000-09-23 20:53:00;20 seconds;Triangular shaped, with an extremely white light all the way around it's borders. A friend and I were stargazing in her back yard, sitting in some lawn chairs.  I had my head tilted back, watching a satellite that had just passed out of view.  Into my filed of sight entered an extremely bright light.  I told my friend, Look at that bright satellite!, which was ridiculous because it was way too bright to be a satellite.  It looked to be extremely high, and was moving at about the same speed of a satellite, faster than any jet could go.  It was lit up with an extremely bright white light.  Upon looking at it closely, it appeared to be a triangular shaped craft with the white light around it's borders.  It was going from the northwest to the southeast above Salt Lake county.  It started going behind a tree...I told my friend I was going to get up to check it out before it went behind the Wasatch Range (mountains), but before I could even get out of my seat, it took off at a rate of speed so fast that it basically vanished before my eyes, and I made sure I didn't take my eyes off of it.  It was one of the most intense colors of bright white I have ever seen, no strobe or any other colors.  My friend was going to report this, but never found the time, so I thought I'd do it, that's why it's coming in late.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
silent, white, kite-like object zooms through the sky;2003-08-30 22:15:00;5 seconds;silent, white, kite-like object zooms through the sky We were looking at mars when I noticed and object that looked like a huge kite or hang glider quickly crossing the sky from north to south.  I said, look! what is that?  My dad and sister both saw it.  It didn't make a sound and was white.  It was only visible for a few seconds before it disappeared.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
2 transparent triangles travel silently through the night sky.;2004-06-13 23:00:00;few secs each;2 transparent triangles travel silently through the night sky. There were four of us in the front yard Me, my wife, and 2 cousins.  We are all in our early twenties.  We were just going to our homes from my mother’s home, which we visit every Sunday to play a game of Risk, when we found my sister had left her keys in the car.  So one of my cousins took the key out and put it on the doorstep because the house was locked behind us. Then my other cousin pointed up at the sky and my wife and I saw this transparent triangle shape.  It flew heading North to South.  I could make out the edges because the transparency did not go all the way to the edge.  It was kind of just fuzzy on the edges.  The object made absolutely no sounds.  There seemed to be no emitted light.  The sighting lasted all of about 2 seconds before it disappeared from view behind some trees.  The cousin who was putting the key on the doorstep did not get to see it there was a porch awning in the way.  He ran out after we all said what the hell is that?.  He thought we were lying.  After we all described what we saw and speculated what it could have been, we decided to stay there a few minutes to see if it would come back.  The cousin that did not see the triangle went out to the middle of the lawn and started running in circles staring at the Big Dipper.  Then he all of a sudden stopped and pointed up. A smaller triangle had appeared in the sky and was headed from North to more Southeast.  It looked more like 2 shaded triangles that may have been linked by a transparent piece or something else.  This one had more speed and disappeared into the night sky.  At first we thought this one was just ducks or geese, but then realized that they usually make noise when flying and do not fly in such a perfect formation.  The cousin that had not seen the first one, now believed us.  We stood around and speculated on this one too, we all drew some pictures of what we thought both looked like on the hood of my sisters car, in the dust that was all over it, and the pictures turned out pretty much identical.  My younger brother, age 15, heard all the noise we were making and looked out his window.  We motioned for him to come down stairs and he did.  We explained this all to him then went back to watching the sky.  We waited to see if another would appear but after about 20 minutes we decided it is time to go home. All we saw in the 20 minutes was 2 Satellites in the sky righ! t above us. One went north to south the other south to north. None of us have ever seen anything like this.  We all agreed on the shape and transparency of the triangles.  We also all agreed that they appeared to be paper-thin.  They made no noise at all, and also made no apparent air disturbance that we could feel or see.  The night was perfectly clear. Not a cloud in sight or on the horizon.  We also could not see the moon in the sky, it might have not risen over the mountains at that point.  My cousins went home and found this article on this web page http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/037/S37316.html which sparked my intrest to post my experience.  I will try to have images posted on my web page that each of us have drawn.  http://www.undergroundvine.net/ufo.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
Two triangular shaped silent translucent white objects seen gliding in night sky.;2004-06-13 23:15:00;10 min;Two triangular shaped silent translucent white objects seen gliding in night sky. I was standing outside and something in the sky caught my eye, at first I thought it was geese heading south, but as I looked up I realized it was actually a large transparent triangle/boomerang shape with whitesh front edges gliding from North to South. It was about the size of a house from where I stood and could not have been more than 200 feet off the ground, traveling at about 50 mph. I shouted at my friends and they caught a glimpse of it as it headed over the trees and disappeared. There were no clouds and it was a completly clear night.  We were speculating about what it could have been for about 10 mins when we saw another smaller object heading in about the same direction. It was made up of two smaller white triangles and one dark. It was about the same altitude as the first but one third the size. It was traveling more than double the speed of the first and both objects were completly silent.  We searched the sight and found a VERY similar sighting in may of this triangular object in Kent, WA.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
Shadowy triangle that was invisible unless you were looking at it from a certain angle;2007-07-05 01:47:00;15 seconds;Shadowy triangle that was invisible unless you were looking at it from a certain angle Me and my friend were laying on my front lawn talking when I noticed a shadow moving in the sky.  It made no noise and had no lighting coming from it.  It just appeared as a dark, triangular, shadow.  When I stood up to get a better view I could no longer see the object.  After that I went to the angle I was when I was laying on the ground and I could see it again.  It had changed direction from east to south.  My friend had seen it too.

We followed a small, silent object with two lights fairly close to us in Sandy, Utah.;2012-03-30 22:45:00;1/2 hour;We followed a small, silent object with two lights fairly close to us in Sandy, Utah. On March 30th at about 10:45 pm in Sandy, Utah, my sister, brother-in-law and I left a movie and were walking to our car.  My brother-in-law asked “what’s that?” pointing upward.  We looked up and saw a few lights fairly close.  They looked to be on two edges of a triangular object.  They looked to be in conical shapes hooked to the edges of the object.  One light turned off and back on a few times while we saw it.  There was not a regular pattern or timing to the flash of this light and only one of them ever went out. It didn’t seem to be very large or very far away and it was completely silent.  Airplanes did pass by and were further away though we could still hear them and their lights blinked regularly and were red and bluish.  The lights on this object were a bright bluish white.  It seemed to move almost like it was drifting (like a balloon), but then it would stop, and hover before continuing on in another direction.  I took a video on my iphone and a few pictures before we got in my car and followed the lights to another spot, trying to get closer where we took more video and photos.   We went to even a third location where it seemed the closest, descending and stopping, hovering almost right over us before taking off and rising again, heading back toward the original spot we saw it. We tried following it back but lost it as it was so low against the skyline and other lights were so bright.  We are not sure what it is but we just want to know what it was.  We are upset we lost it and were hoping to see it again.  At times it seemed aware of us and coming towards us, but I never felt any threat from it.  Any help to figure out this situation would be greatly appreciated.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327

She said it had been there almost 10 minutes and we were talking it started moving very slowly south and as it was over us more lights appeared all around it in a triangle shaped moving in sync counter clockwise, all blinking in a weird pattern.   As it went over head you could tell it was a solid triangle.;40.5822495049506;-111.830723267327
