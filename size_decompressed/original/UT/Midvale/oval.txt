Darkened Oval with 8 to 9 red, orange and yellow beams moving and hovering in the sky.;2013-03-14 20:25:00;10 minutes;Darkened Oval with 8 to 9 red, orange and yellow beams moving and hovering in the sky. On Thursday, March 14, 2013 about 8:25 p.m. I went outside to take the dog out.  I had my two year old Grandson in my arms.  We were walking around the yard in the night air.  I looked up into the sky over my Sister’s yard next door and saw and oval shape in the sky that was darker than the night sky.  There were 8 or 9 cone shaped beams coming from this oval.  The type if shape you would put around a sun if you were drawing one.  Similar to this  0&gt.  They were a variegated red, orange and golden yellow.  Red being closest to the oval then the orange and then turning to yellow.  The beams did not protrude from what seemed to be the front of the object. The object or craft hovered for perhaps one to two minutes.  It had to be only a few blocks East of where I was standing.  Then slowly moved positions, heading North, stopped, hovered again then slowly moved forward North again.  Momentarily I could not see it behind my Sister’s house.  I walked to the front yard, laughed because here I was following it with my Grandson in my arms.  Watched it hover again for about the same period of time. My neighbor came out to bring her trash can to the curb and started talking to me.  I promptly brought he attention to the object in the sky.  She said, How strange.  Well there is supposed to be a comet tonight.  I then said, That is not a comet, a comet does not hover!  The comet then moved North again.  Stopped hovered shot something out of it.  What looked like it fired something out of it.  That was golden yellow and went for perhaps a few miles and dissipated.  Then it took off speeding North East.;40.6124;-111.8832
