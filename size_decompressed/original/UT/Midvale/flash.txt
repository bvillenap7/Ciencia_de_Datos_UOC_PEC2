Rainbow of colors disrupts the Utah night sky.;2017-01-11 23:45:00;3-4 seconds;Rainbow of colors disrupts the Utah night sky. A friend & I were on our way home driving on I-215 in Midvale, UT.  Our conversation was disrupted & for 3-4 seconds the sky over the Eastern Mountains of Utah, near Salt Lake City, went from being typical black/dark, to green, red, blue, pink,...honestly every color imaginable, then back to dark, as if nothing happened.   No actual craft was witnessed, but the display of colors in the night sky was clearly not natural.;40.6124;-111.8832
