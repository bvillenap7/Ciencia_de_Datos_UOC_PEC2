Then my friend came put with the other dog. Witness two:  flashes of light behind the clouds, lighting up the sky multiple flashes seconds apart different areas of the sky and no streaks and no rain after hand to explain it streched probably across half of the sky and stopped in matter of a few min with no evidence in sky of anything clouds gone no planes not one thing in the sky where we see it. Witness one:  It lit up the whole sky in a square diagonally shoting lite sporadically.  Then it like sucked itself up & disappeaerd.  No evidence it was even there.  Crazy if there was ever a doubt it is definitely gone.  I've searched all over for hours.  Nothing like this ever reportded.  They manipulate the weather to cloak themselves.  Thats how we r learning to do it.  What is going on?  Please explain what we just saw!-!!!;40.6124;-111.8832
