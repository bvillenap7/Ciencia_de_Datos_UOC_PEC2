Boomerang shaped set of lights over Midvale Utah.;1976-06-01 01:00:00;15-30 seconds;Boomerang shaped set of lights over Midvale Utah. Iâ€™m guesing at the date and time as I was a young boy and that was quite a while ago. This must have been between June and August as I visited there on summer vacation from school. I believe I was around ten years old. I was sleeping out in the back yard at a friends house.  We were laying with our heads to the East and feet to the West.  The closest East running street is what used to be called Greenwood ave. (7800 So.?)   I remember being almost asleep and looking directly above and slightly to the South and I saw a boomarang shaped set of lights aproximately 500-1000 feet up. The object was moving in a straight line from East to West and made no sound that I remember. I could not see an outline of the craft only the lights.  The lights were smooth edged, round, and evenly spaced.  They were off white or pale yellow, the closest color I can compare it to is a halogen street light. I remember there being one light at the corner (point) of the angle in front and maybe three trailing the center light on each side at approximately a 45 degree angle like a carpenters square or boomerang. I remember pointing it out to my friend.  As I stated before, I was almost asleep and must have fallen asleep after it passed out of sight.;40.6124;-111.8832
