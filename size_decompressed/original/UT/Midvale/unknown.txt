I stepped off my back porch to have a cigarette at approximately 1 a.m. on the night of July 15th, 2020.  I noticed a flashing light in the sky but there was something that was strange about it.  It would flash on and offbut every time it flashed on it was in a different position in the sky and in order for it to do that it had to be traveling at a speed like nothing that I had ever seen.it basically was almost disappearing and appearing again in a different spot.  it was blink off and then when it came back on it would be several miles away from where it was before. I watched it for about 15 minutes and when it was right above me it blinked one more time and then I never saw it again.it's acceleration have to be miraculous because it was almost like it appeared in one spot and then disappeared and appeared in the other without even going from one spot to the other this was the first UFO sighting I have ever had in my lifetime and I'm 65 years old.;40.6124;-111.8832
