Red fireballs over Orem, Utah;2013-02-01 22:00:00;15 minutes;Red fireballs over Orem, Utah I am in the habit of watching the skies when I walk my dogs at night, and have a keen interest in astronomy, so I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on normal phenomenon. On February 1st, I was walking my dogs as usual, when I noticed a red light in the sky.  It was in Orion, so my first thought was that I was seeing either Mars or Betelgeuse, then I realized it was too bright for either one.  It then faded away.  I noticed several other red lights in the sky following the same path.  I watched for a moment, thinking that they might be airplanes, until I saw an actual airplane fly by, between me and the lights.  These lights seemed to form a wide arc across the sky, then one by one they faded out. After the arc of lights faded, I noticed several lights that, from my vantage point, seemed to start near the south-south-east horizon (at least under the tree-line), rise up about 10 degrees in a straight line, then fade away.  I saw about five follow this pattern, before the cold and my dogs forced me back indoors. I was out for about 15 minutes.  I tried to see if I could see the lights from my window, but my view of where they were coming from was blocked by other buildings. I wondered if they were flares, but they traveled in straight lines, not an arc like something shot.  They also didn't flare, they stayed the same brightness until they faded away.  I also didn't hear any noises that made me think that they might be flares or fireworks.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
Reddish dots disappearing.;2015-03-08 20:00:00;2-5 minutes;Reddish dots disappearing. It was 2 strange red dots probably 1 mile in the sky.  They sort of looked like eyes.   They moved away a few minutes later, I tried to follow them but lost them.   After a minute or so after seeing them, one of them seemed to disappear.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
