Sphere with left side lit by sun and slight bright line outlining the right;2004-06-14 07:15:00;1/2 hour;Sphere with left side lit by sun and slight bright line outlining the right Looked like a ball.  White on the side the sun was coming up on.  Barely visible at times and at other times could see the shape of the ball.  I was in clouds at first with blue sky in the background but the clouds went northeast and the ball went west and then up in the sky.  Many clouds floated by but it stayed in the same place for a long time.  It was definately a sphere.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
Two red/orange spheres over Orem, Utah.;2013-01-12 22:15:00;5+ minutes;Two red/orange spheres over Orem Utah I just got off work and I was heading west when I noticed a bright red/orange flickering in the sky WSW of me.  It appeared to be a lighted lantern.  I pulled over to watch it.  It was moving to the North East, about the speed a helicopter would travel.  As it got closer to my location, but still at a distance, I noticed a second object, just the same as the first, but a little brighter, traveling the same route, just a little more south than the first.  The first object slowed then appeared to stop and hover as the second approached, maybe 1-2 blocks away.  The light of both had dimmed a little, but the light of the second remained brighter than the first. They were both moving very slowly at this time. Their movement was almost undetectable if you didnâ€™t have a fixed object to compare it to.  I opened the car door to listen for sounds but heard nothing, so I then turned off the car and stepped out and still heard nothing. It was quite cold (7  degrees)  so! I thought I might be able to hear something.   They proceeded to move north at this time, very slowly.  At this point I decided to leave, quite shook. I opened my sunroof when I was less than a block away and could see one of them directly above me.  I continued on my way home.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
Glowing, hovering object descends straight down to the ground;2013-07-10 21:00:00;1 minute;Glowing, hovering object descends straight down to the ground I went outside to grab something from my car, I looked up and saw it and it was hovering and drifting back and forth.  I went back into the condo to grab my iPhone and came back out and shot the short video of it dropping toward the ground.  I didn't see it again after that and went back inside.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
5 spherical orbs seen floating in the sky.;2014-10-02 11:30:00;3.5 hours;5 spherical orbs seen floating in the sky I was outside with my wife when I looked up at a clear blue sky I noticed 3 white spheres in a 170 degree angle a few miles apart.  The altitude was above planes but it looked like they were in our atmosphere.  They gradually floated around the sky for several hours. When I went outside later to see if they're were there I saw two more.  The two were very spaced out and the other three were still together.  I noticed throughout the time they would get smaller and bigger probably changing altitutdes.  Only one remained the last 30 mins the rest vanished;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
