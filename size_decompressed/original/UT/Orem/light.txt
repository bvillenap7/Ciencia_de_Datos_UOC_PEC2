Sattelite looking UFO stops suddenly;2007-06-26 21:45:00;5minutes;Sattelite looking UFO stops suddenly We were waiting for some nearby fireworks to begin, and airplanes often fly overhead. My son pointed out a pintpoint light that was traveling accross the sky, it looked like a sattelite. It was moving about as fast as a satellite. Then it stopped for a moment, and changed course and slowly faded as it took an erradic course in the opposite direction it was going. It was not a firework or a plane. The night was very clear and it was much to high for a plane/helicopter, and nothing stops and changes directions like that. But it was a true UFO, meaning unidentified.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878

Glowing green craft with flashing lights instantly disappeared;2012-02-02 00:06:00;1 minute;Glowing green craft with flashing lights instantly disappeared I was walking across an empty parking lot at Utah Valley University.  I was looking West, towards the lake.  I do this every time I am in the parking lot because I have seen strange objects over it before.  What I first thought was an airplane caught my attention, but it seemed to be a little lower than what I normally see planes fly over the lake.  As my gaze lingered, I noticed it the blinking light pattern was strange and that the craft was faintly glowing green. The blinking lights went from left to right in quick succession, flashing red, white, red with a slight pause when nothing was flashing and only the faint green glow, which was shaped in a slight arc, was visible. It was heading North for at least 20-30 seconds, but it lowered a bit in the sky and switched directions so it was moving north east.  When it changed directions another light was added to the pattern.  It went white, red, white, red. Then it switched directions again and headed straight north for maybe 10 seconds and completely and instantly disappeared.  There were no clouds in that part of the sky and no boundaries that could hide it from me.  It didn't 'quickly' disappear or 'fade', it was there one second and completely gone the next.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
Green orb of light moving in low horizontal trajectory.;2012-08-21 21:30:00;2 seconds;Green orb of light moving in low horizontal trajectory. My husband and my neighbor were standing outside talking at about 9:30 at night in our neighborhood and saw a glowing, misty orb of light.  The glowing edges of the orb were more green than the center.  It traveled in a low horizontal trajectory.  It looked as if it was traveling in a trajectory as high above the ground as the height of six story building.  It was difficult to tell how large it was but looked fairly close.  If I outstretched my arm and made a little circle with my thumb and forefinger it could have fit in that small circle.  I live close to a golf course and it looked like it was traveling over the golf course, but from my vantage point on the ground it could have been higher and farther away.  It appeared out of no where and disappeared within a second.  It traveled from north to south and I was viewing it from the west looking eastward toward the mountains.  It was really beautiful and was not frightening.  It made absolutely no sound and there was no tail like when you see a meteor.  We all said, “Whoa, what was that?”  My husband and I are in our fifties.  He is a professional and I am a homemaker.  Our friend is in his late thirties and a professional.  I have never seen any phenomena of this sort in all of my life or anything that would mimic or even come close to it.  It could not have been any type of laser light, fireworks, meteor, or aircraft to my knowledge.  It was astounding.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878

Spheres of red/orange lights in the sky.;2013-04-26 22:10:00;1 minute;Spheres of red/orange lights in the sky At approximately 22:10, I picked up my daughter and her friend from birthday party and proceeded drive approx .25 miles away to drop off the friend at her house.  While traveling south along a residential road, we all noticed ahead of us in the sky,  five to seven orbs or spheres of light that appeared to be red or orange in color.   They appeared to be stationary in the sky at about a 45 degree angle from our position.  We all commented at how weird they looked.  At first we thought maybe some sort of lantern, but they did not move in the sky, nor did they flicker. We dropped off the friend, and began traveling down the road in a westerly direction.  As I was driving, I couldn’t maintain eye contact so I would watch the road and occasionally glance up at the lights.   At one point, about 1 minute after dropping off the friend, I looked at the lights, then glanced back at the road for approximately three seconds , then looked back at the lights, and found that they all had vanished.  My daughter didn’t see them vanish either.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878

Event time was about 2 minutes I was driving on 800 N coming from Provo Canyon when I get to the stop light intersection with State St. ready to turn South (left) I so first about 6 Orange solid lights, at first I thought was some helicopters because they weren't on a specific formation and suddenly they form a circle shape and vanished after about 5 seconds after they form the circle, I was trying to call my wife, daughter and son to verify that if they can see it from home, I lived South Orem.  But unfortunately they didn't answer.  After the 6 light disappeared one more Orange light arrived to the same spot, so I change my line so I do not turn left on State Street and then I drove towards the Provo Lake looking the light and tried to hear any sound, I stop on the side of the road but the light vanished the same way that the other did.  So I couldn't recorded anything.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878

It was there for about 30 minutes and then just disappeared.  We witnessed helicopters using, search lights, over the area after the light was gone.

Very bright white light, motionless in western Utah night sky, sat still for 15 minutes then vanished in a blink of an eye.;2020-02-12 21:00:00;15 minutes;Very bright white light, motionless in western Utah night sky, sat still for 15 minutes then vanished in a blink of an eye. My mother (who is a skeptic and doesn’t necessarily believe in UFO’s) called to inform me about a very bright white light she noticed while driving home, as I went outside, sure enough a large single bright white light was shining strongly through Utah’s thick smoggy air, no other stars or planets were visible in that portion of the western Utah sky due to the smog.  It seemed to be sitting stagnate, no changes, no movement, no pulsation, almost as if it was pretending to be a star but was noticeably too bright to be one... using a star chart I could not identify any star or planet in its location.  I looked down at my phone and when I looked up it was gone, only darkness remained with no sight of this mysterious light.  Vanished in a blink of an eye.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
