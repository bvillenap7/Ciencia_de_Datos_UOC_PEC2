Two women saw an eerie, unlit, gliding, saucer-like object while watching for a meteor shower in a soccer field.;2013-08-31 23:29:00;6 seconds;Two women saw an eerie, unlit, gliding, saucer-like object while watching for a meteor shower in a soccer field. We are two females a high school senior and a college graduate (B.S. Music).  We went outside, across the street to a soccer field to look at the stars because we saw on facebook that there was supposed to be a meteor shower.  It was cloudy so we were disappointed and ready to leave when we saw a bizarre flying object flying not above nor below the clouds, but directly through them.  It had no lights, but appeared to reflect some of the city lights or something because we could see the front of its disk shape because of a crescent of reflected light on the front of it.  If you held a silver dollar to the sky, that is how large it appeared to be.  It was very strange and eerie, as the object was almost like a hologram in the way it moved through the clouds in a way that made us think we were seeing an optical illusion.  Neither of us have ever touched alcohol or drugs and can confirm our mental stability.  It appeared to have vanished before our eyes, but because it was difficult to see, it may have just risen above the clouds and out of sight.  The whole sighting lasted about 6 seconds, but we both know we saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
