Bright light vanishes in a puff of smoke;2006-09-16 17:00:00;2 minutes;Bright light vanishes in a puff of smoke My bother-in-law and myself were talking outside late afternoon. I looked up over my head in the sky and noticed a bright light. I pointed it out to my brother-in-law. It wasn't easy to find because it was very small. Smaller than a planet when you can see it in daylight. The light looked as if it were reflected light from the sun on the object. I could not tell the shape of the object but soon the reflected light turned about 90 deg and could not see the light no more. I could tell that there was an object but it was too far away to discern it's shape or color. All of a sudden, there seemed to be a billow of smoke. Best described when a vehicle punches the gas and the exhaust billows from the tailpipe. Very similiar to that. Then, it appeared as if the object moved vertically from it's stationary spot...and disappeared into thin air. This all occured in the clear blue sky and no clouds around. There was a jet flying near by but unrelated to this object (different elevation and stayed on vector). This object did not behave the normal aircraft I have seen. Kinda cool! Never seen a UFO before.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
150 Blinking lights in a line.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-08-13 21:15:00;5 minutes;150 Blinking lights in a line. Came from the north 150 of them.  Went the speed of a satellite but they were all blinking and all the same.  They were all in a line and then looked like the first ones began to slow down and wait for the stragglers to catch up.  Went across the whole Eastern sky going south.  Neighbors saw and people we called 25 miles away.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
