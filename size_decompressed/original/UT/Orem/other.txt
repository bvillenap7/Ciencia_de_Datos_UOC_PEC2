Five connected lights moving in the direction of the point at an unearthly speed.;2000-09-02 21:30:00;3 seconds;Five connected lights moving in the direction of the point at an unearthly speed. My family and I were attending a storytelling festival outdoors. There were perhaps 3,000 other people present. Surprisingly, no else commented on what I saw, even though I tried to point it out to my wife and my sudden and excited words to her were no doubt heard by people sitting immediately around us--Look! Wow! Don't you see that?! You didn't see that?! Most of the seating was on the grass. At the time, I happened to be reclined and looking up at the sky (the time was about 2130-2200). Earlier, I had seen a few shooting stars.  The object--which looked like five lights forming a point--appeared suddenly, as if it were just there, many miles above me. (I am almost certain that the five lights formed a singular object. The position of the lights was too symmetrical and the object moved in perfect unison so as not to appear as multiple objects.) The individual lights emitted what I might describe as luminous radiation, and the points of light seemed to be connected by the same type of luminous radiation. It moved in the direction of the point (west) within 2 or 3 seconds it was gone, moving faster than anything man-made could move. If you are interested, I can provide you with an accurate drawing.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
I saw a boomerang shaped craft fly slowly over my house, it had no lights and made no noise, it was black and outlined in gray.;2004-08-11 22:30:00;1 minute;I saw a boomerang shaped craft fly slowly over my house, it had no lights and made no noise, it was black and outlined in gray. On August 11th, 2004 at around 10:30 pm I saw a boomerang shaped aircraft fly over my house very slowly heading southeast. At first I thought maybe it was some sort of military aircraft but it made no noise and did not have any lights on it. It appeared to be flying about anywhere from 50-150 mph and was probably about 1,000-2,000 feet up in the air. The aircraft was black and outlined in a thin haze of gray. It was a fairly large aircraft, larger than a 747. I have never seen anything like it and do not know of any aircraft, particularly something that large that doesn't any noise. I saw it for about less than a minute until I lost sight of it. That night the sky was clear.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
Wing shaped craft seen at night, no lights, no sound.;2020-04-18 23:00:00;10 seconds;Wing shaped craft seen at night, no lights, no sound. My family and I were having a bonfire on a Saturday night.  Around 11:00 pm one of my kids (11) noticed something in the sky. He first thought it was a bird.  My two other kids (15, and 17) and myself also saw it just then. It was moving quickly in the sky at a constant rate of speed. There were no lights visible, no sound was heard before or after the sighting that would sound at all like an aircraft.  It was difficult to see due to the dark night sky as the backdrop. It appeared to be shaped like a wing, no fuselage was visible.  It appeared to large to be a drone, and it covered a distance of ~4-5 miles in about 7-8 seconds. My wife didn't see the craft, however, immediately after the craft left our view she told the kids to get inside and go to bed.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
