15 white lights flying in V formation over utah county;2012-05-04 22:35:00;4-5 seconds;15 white lights flying in V formation over utah county I went outside of my apartment to have a cigarette. I was facing east towards utah lake looking up in the sky. All of the sudden there were 12 to 15 bright lights flying in a V formation from south to north.  They were going very very fast fast enough to break the sound barrier in my opinion. I didn't hear anything.  The speed they were going reminded me of shooting stars. The V formation wasn't perfect witch led me to believe that all the crafts where individual.  They were extremely bright (white) and big. like the size of holding a dime at arms length.  They didn't leave a trail or tracers & they didn't change color.  It sent chills down my spine cause it was as plane as day and the most bizarre thing i have ever witnessed in my life.  The crafts were flying a few hundred feet above the mountains behind utah lake (to the east). Maybe 20 seconds after the event i looked to the south and saw an airplane flying from south to north but it was much closer to me (to! the west) Im not sure if the airplane was close enough to see it.  This is the second time in 8 months that i personally have witnessed ufo's in Utah.  Strange things are happening in utah.  what's with all the 2012 UFOS?????????

Can someone please try to explain this to me and how this could be physically possible?;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
