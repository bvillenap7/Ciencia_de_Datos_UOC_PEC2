I also saw round porthole type windows and the shadow of human looking people looking out. the rear had rectangular lights sort of where you would look for rear thrusters. it was silent heading for the north entance of the underground base 80 miles west .;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
Black object moving slowly from North to South.;1997-11-10 20:00:00;1 min;Black object moving slowly from North to South. I was laying in my dads backyard looking up at the stars.  Perfectly clear sky no moon.  Just to the north I saw a very thin white curved line appear, moving in a southern direction.  The line was so thin I could hardly see it.  It looked kind of like a curved bolt of lightning. Following the line was a object blacker than the night sky.  The line started to fade away until it was completly gone.  I could still see the black object moving slowly, against the stars that would disappear then reappear.  Just before it past over the trees the lights from the city reflected off of it.  It had a brown tint, and the front edge was almost white.  I saw no flashing lights or other elumination from the object, only the reflection of the city lights. The shape was triangular but closer to what the stealth bomber looks like.  I thought it might have been the stealth bomber but the speed seemed to be to slow for its altitude and size.  There was no sound.  It was about 200 feet from the ground so, if it was a jetplane, I definatly would have heard some noise.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878

Late one Friday night at approximately 1:30a.m., my husband and I were going to bed. My husband noticed through our bedroom window, what he first thought was an airplane, but after watching it for a moment, he realized it wasn't moving.  He then told me to come and look at this object. I also observed what I first thought was an airplane.  This object had white lights, with flashing green and red lights.  We noticed that this object didn't change its position in the sky, but seemed to be floating in the same place.  We ran and got binoculars and were able to see that this object was triangular in shape with rows of white lights, with red and green lights at the bottom.  We decided to go out in our backyard to see if we could get a better look.  By the time we got outside, the object had moved farther away from us, so we couldn't make out it's shape anymore with binoculars-but it was still in the same position in the sky-it just seemed to be farther up or away.  We continued to  look at this object for about 10 more minutes and observed that it continued to move farther and farther away in the sky, so all that could really be seen was the white light. The total time we watched this object was about 20 to 25 minutes.  It was in the sky at a northeast position seemingly above Mt Timpanogos.  Since that first sighting, we have seen the object at least 4 or 5 more nights, in the same location, at the same time of night. We are average white homeowers, taxpaying, law abiding citizens who up to this experience did not believe in UFOs.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878

Red creature seen early in the day, triangle seen later;2016-10-15 12:00:00;all day;Red creature seen early in the day, triangle seen later Early in the day, probably around noon, my 10-year old daughter and 8-year old son were out playing in a field behind our house with 3 kids from the neighborhood. The field is about 2.5 acres in size and full of old cherry trees (it was an orchard back in the day) and knee-high orchard grass. My wife and I were in the kitchen when the kids came running in terrified, claiming they’d seen some small red creature peeking out from behind a bush. We were both struck by how seriously scared they were. They all saw it and explained how they watched it for a minute or so as it kept looking at them. I went out later and, based on their description, estimated it was about 70 feet away from them. We gave them the 20 questions was it a fox, dog, etc.? But they insisted it was a creature on two legs and bright red. Like fire engine red, not a hue of red that exists in nature. The color they described made me skeptical. My wife and I were still mildly creeped out, but we! sort of wrote it off as kids seeing things. The kids refused to go back out that day.  Later that evening after dark, around 9-10pm, my 16-year old son (who had no knowledge of what his siblings claimed they saw earlier) came into the house scared, claiming he had seen something bizarre. He and two friends were walking just a few blocks from our house and saw a craft in the air. He said initially his brain couldn’t compute what it was. It was too low and not moving fast enough. At first, he thought it was a plane or helicopter crashing, but realized it wasn’t when he saw that it was triangular shaped with lights on the corners and was moving too slow and steady. He said there was a slight buzzing sound to it and it was dull metallic in texture.  He said it eventually went behind some trees that were around houses. He and his friends ran to keep it in their line of sight, but once they got to where they should’ve seen it, it had disappeared. He said given the speed it was moving and the time it took them to get into a better position, it should have still been there. So it seemed to disappear and the improbableness of it frightened them. He came home pretty shook about it and he’s not one to exaggerate or make stuff up.  Either event on its own is weird, but both happening on the same day was just bizarre and jolted us a bit. I was more disturbed by my older son’s experience, knowing the kind of kid he is. This motivated me to read about UFOs and I found your website and read up on others’ experiences. My older brother had seen a triangle years before, so I didn’t think that was too far-fetched, but I must admit the red creature experience was hard to believe and still is. However, I was surprised to find a couple stories on your website that also mentioned little bright red creatures. If you’re going to make something up, it seems like an odd color choice. I wonder how many others report a similar experience.  By the way, the date is approximate.;40.2679625954198;-111.661476335878
