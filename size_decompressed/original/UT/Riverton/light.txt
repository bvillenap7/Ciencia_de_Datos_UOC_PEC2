At first I thought it was a plane crashing into the mountains.  Saw a streak of light vertical in the sky.  At first I thought it was a plane crashing into the mountains.  But, the streak wasn't as long as what usually follows a plane and it was much brighter.  It was not moving fast, at first I thought it wasn't moving it all.   As I continued to watch, I noted that it was slowly descending until it finally went behind the mountain.  Then I saw 2 more, both right above the mountains in the east like the first.  They were not moving fast enough to be a plane and the streaks of light were very bright.   I watched them for about 15 minutes until all but one had disappeared behind the mountain and then I came to report it.  I called a friend who could see it also and had never seen anything like it.;40.4953;-111.9439
