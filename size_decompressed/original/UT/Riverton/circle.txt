He said he could see it also but that it was North of the belt, less than a length.  I was watching it with a pair of 10 X 50 binoculars placed on my van.  My friend was trying to use a telescope he wasn't familiar with.  At 1:40 the sphere completely disappeared from view.   My friend said he could still see it.   At 1:50 it reappeared but was much lower on the horizon about 5 degrees and a little further south as I had moved my location to see it on the backside of my neighbors garage.  The sphere was still pulsating but only white light.     At 2:05 it disappeared all together for both my friend in Orem and myself in Riverton.;40.4953;-111.9439
20-30 Red and Orange glowing Crafts moving slow for aircraft (30-40 MPH).;2013-05-03 21:00:00;30 minutes;20-30 Red and Orange glowing Crafts moving slow for aircraft (30-40 MPH). Around 9:00 PM (MST) My Family and I witnessed 20 to 30 round looking UFOs Orange and Red in color coming over the mountains west of Herriman moving very slowly (30-40 mph)and almost following each other in single file, and traveling due East (towards our direction) about 300-500 ft above the ground. As they got closer to us they gradually increased their elevation to about 1,000 ft until they got almost directly south of us, then changing their direction to heading South and increasing more in elevation and eventually fading out of sight, behind  cloud cover.;40.4953;-111.9439
