When my brother came running into the house he said UFO, GUYS, UFO!  Then everyone came running out of the house to see them.  Once they were in our eye-sight we were just amazed!  They were all a seperate bright white light that was perfectly lit like a light-bulb seen from a good distance.  Then everyone got on the roof of the house to get a better view.  They didn't stop coming, they were all coming over the oquirrh mountains east of our directionâ€¦   It seemed that they were coming from Dugway Proving Grounds. We were all amazed and I asked everyone how they felt and they said they felt loved...  And I'm like I feel the same way to for some reason!  I had no negative feeling about there presence!  I was happy!  IT WAS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME EXPERIENCE I WILLNEVER FORGET IT WAS AMAZING!!!;40.4953;-111.9439
