No lights at all. 1&quot long I had taken up watching the night sky for flocks of birds, satellites, and meteors.  I was just barely able to discern a flying silhouette against the starlight.  The Heading North from South in straight trajectory.  Dark oblong silhouette that must have been fairly low to be of an inch length to my line of sight.  Not impressive.  Just dark and fairly fast on a calm night, clear skies.  No lights, just starlight.  Wind was 0 MPH, temperature was 65 F, dew point 48, pressure at 29.68.  I held it in vision for around 10 complete seconds from when I spotted it just above my house heading north steadily cruising.  No audibles. Oh well. Prob just a simple thing on a course. But why no lights whatsoever at that lower altitude? I was very lucky to have seen it. My friend next to me could not make it out since there was no way to guide the sight of it. It was only defined against starlight and the suburban night ether. To the grave. It remains an unidentified flying object.
