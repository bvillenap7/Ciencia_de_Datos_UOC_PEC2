Next I pulled over and got out of my car and watched the bottom 2 move one went right and one went left forming a triangle shape they sat in that position for about a min or so.  Then the top light started to go smaller as if it was going farther away and the other two followed it was definitely the weirdest thing I've ever seen;41.0669;-111.7264
