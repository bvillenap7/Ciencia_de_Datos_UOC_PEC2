A friend of mine was sitting in his hot tub and texted me saying that there was a UFO in the eastern sky above the Wellsville mountain range.  I went to my window and I saw a bright, white capsular shaped light that had bluish colored trailing tail lights. It was at least 3 or 4 times brighter and larger than any other light in the sky. It was moving from south to north directly above the Wellsvilles. It was slowly moving north and then stopped and then after a few seconds moved in a downward direction for a few seconds, stopped again for a few seconds and then started moving north again. I ran to get my wife to see it and when we got back to the window it had stopped in the sky at the north end of the mountain range. The shape had changed to a very, very large twinkling bright white star-like shape. It was still by far the brightest light in the sky. We sat at watched it for 20 minutes and during that time the light started to very slowly move north and the! light started to dim until it disappeared. My dog was sitting on the couch staring directly at the light the entire time we were. We were able to look at it through binoculars and there were purple, green, blue and red lights that were twinkling at the edges of the bright white light.  My friend that watched it from about 10 miles west of us, which puts him at the base of the Wellsville mountain range, said that he observed 5 lights in a circle that morphed into 3 lights in a triangle then finally the 3 lights converged into one bright light.;41.6337;-111.856
