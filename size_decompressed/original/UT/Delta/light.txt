Hovering light in the sky that left a trail of light behind it.;2016-07-22 20:00:00;5-8 minutes;Hovering light in the sky that left a trail of light behind it. Driving Home to Delta, on road by Materion, and noticed light in sky.  Thought it was an airplane, but it was just hovering there.   Then it just took off to the right and left a light trail in the sky that slowly disappeared. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Yes I thought I wrote July 21, 2016, @ 20:00hrs on the report.  And I'm in Delta, UT, out in the middle of nowhere, and whatever I saw, I thought was a plane or a shooting star, but was brighter and out of place, just sitting in the sky.  Then it shot off to the right of me, leaving a fading trail behind it.  I was just driving home when I saw it.    I have a Daughter in Wichita, Kansas, so I never changed my number.  Thanks for the reply I thought your number wasn't valid and you were going to throw little green men jokes at me, or something.  And the laughing was the Benny Hill Show.
