35 objects flying approximately 1,500 feet above ground going in a straight line-type formation. ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-26 22:00:00;5 seconds;35 objects flying approximately 1,500 feet above ground going in a straight line-type formation. Many of them were in groups of 3. A few of them were flying irregularly by going faster than the others. The formation covered a few miles in distance from firsts to lasts. The speed was much faster than an airplane and the formation made clear they were not satellites, flares, or other man-made things. The most sorprendente event was when they disappeared as they flew into a hole not much bigger than they were.;39.3717;-112.5313
