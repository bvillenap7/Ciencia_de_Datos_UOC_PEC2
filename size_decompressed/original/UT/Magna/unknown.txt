A streak of smoke just appearing from over the Oaker Mountains.;2003-04-11 01:55:00;seconds;April 11,2003. Time 1:57 am. from over the oaker mountains west of Salt Lake city. Now the best way to explain this sighting is a streak of smoke just appearing from over the Oaker Mountains. I did not get a look at the object because the object was gone as I  looked at the flash, ( I can't think of anything to compare it to, the smoke trail from the object was just there, like lightning ). ( I can not say if it was smoke or water vaper from the object heating the water in the air much like a cloud. ) The object that made the streak caught my attention, it was much like a camera flash in motion. I pulled my car over and took video of the streak in the sky.  when I got home I went into my back yard and took more video of the streak of smoke. At this time the streak had dissipated. There was no Airplane or Jets in the sky making a contrail. ((NUFORC Note:  We may post the graphic of the event, provided by the witness.  We do know that there is a blue-green laser, which is used by a physics/atmospheric science department in this area, but the witness asserts that such a device would not appear to explain what he witnessed.
