Disk, Gray Metallic color.;2021-04-05 00:30:00;3 minutes;Disk, Gray Metallic color. I had woken up to use the bathroom at about 0:25 on April 5th.(12:25, Midnight) As I was walking back to my room I saw lights coming through my bedroom window. I looked out the window and saw dozens of big disks in the sky, their lights flashing. They were a gray color, some were lighter than others. They looked nothing like they do in T.V shows with random blue lights or orbs, they looked like Frisbee's. The weird thing was they kept coming over a cloud, dozens upon dozens coming over this cloud. They flew over my home and make no noise at all. No engine noises, no anything. After they went over my house, The light began to come through my little sisters window. I quickly ran over too see what they were doing and they were slowly moving with again no sound. They stayed for 3 minutes at least until they left and I couldn't see them anymore. I woke up and had a big scratch across my stomach with pain. I have believed in Aliens for along time but never seen an! ything like this. I have seen maybe 1 or 2 before but not as many as I saw last night. Written on 4/5/21 at 9:37 AM.;40.6979;-112.0865
