Blue U.F.O. over American Fork Utah.;2012-01-27 20:45:00;5-6 minutes;Blue U.F.O. over American Fork Utah. My friend and I were just exiting a restaurant when we looked up to see a disk shape object with blue lights on it.  The blue lights went in a circle and then formed a cross through the center of the object.  At three of the edges of the cross were red blinking lights and on the fourth edge an orange blinking light.    My friend and I promptly checked our watches when we realized it was a U.F.O. to determine if we were to experience missing time.   Unfortunately this phenom did not occur.  We stood and watched the craft head south.  There were several people in the same parking lot watching as well.  No one had any idea what it was.    After a few minutes we hopped in our car and on the way home I called Peter Davenport and reported the sighting.;40.3969;-111.7919
