Three red lights in sky over American Fork;2011-01-26 19:15:00;20 minutes;Three red lights in sky over American Fork January 27 2011 my sister and I were driving down state street in American Fork Utah and noticed three red lights in the form of a triangle in the sky.  While watching these three red lights they began dropping white lights below them.  They hovered in one spot for about 10 minutes and began moving South East while continuing to  release a few more white lights for maybe a total of fifteen (we were so shocked that we did not really keep track).  We watched for about 20 minutes until they were out of sight.  Other people had noticed them in the parking lot that we pulled into, there were five others that we saw watching them.;40.3969;-111.7919
Strange lights dropping sparkley substances are seen by many above American Fork Utah 1-26-11.;2011-01-26 19:17:00;6 minutes;Strange lights dropping sparkley substances are seen by many above American Fork Utah 1-26-11. Upon pulling into my driveway in Lehi,  Utah, my 10 year old son said: Dad, what are those?   He pointed out three fairly bright red lights that were hovering high above an adjacent town to the east, American Fork.  These lights were periodically dropping white, sparkley substances.  I happened to have a flip-cam in my car and began filming.  During the filming, my children, neighbor kids and I discussed candidly what we were seeing.  At about the 5 minute point of this video, the lights began to dim and drift south. This video can be seen at UFO over American Fork 1-26-11 on youtube.  Enough people witnessed this event that a local newscast, ABC4 carried the story for a couple of days without coming to any conclusion regarding the source of these lights. An interesting side-story occurred on this same evening when Dugway Proving Grounds, a military base about an hour west of this sighting, went on a very lengthy lockdown.  Mis-labeled nerve agent was the released reason for this lockdown. ((NUFORC Note:  We have watched the video, and it is interesting.  We cannot identify the red objects, which were photographed with a video camera.  PD));40.3969;-111.7919

3 bright orange flashing lights, and one craft that flew very fast.;2015-08-04 23:30:00;2-3 seconds;3 bright orange flashing lights, and one craft that flew very fast. Laying on the trampoline with my nephew, when we seen a large orange object flash and stay lit for about two seconds then disappear.   As soon as it did, a smaller one did the same thing right next to where the big one was.  When that disappeared, the same size orange ball appeared several miles away to the left.   We waited for quite some time trying to figure out what they were, when I seen a craft (almost looked like a stork) start from one spot and fly to the south extremely fast and disappear leaving almost a contrail that didn't last for a few seconds.   The craft was about 200 ft up from us. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above, to reflect a nighttime sighting.  We are awaiting confirmation of the time from the witness.
