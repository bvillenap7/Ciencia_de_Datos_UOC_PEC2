My friend and I were in 3rd grade eating lunch around noon out on the school playground of Shelly Elementary of Alpine School District in American Fork, Utah.  It was a clear Friday before Easter Sunday in 1987.  Looking up into the northeast sky, about 5 miles away and perhaps 5000 to 10000 feet above the ground, we noticed approximately a dozen objects slowly moving south.  They had a metallic shimmer in the sunlight and made no noise.  The objects faded in and out in unison as they flew across the sky in what appeared to be a square or diamond formation (from our perspective).  We were able to observe this phenomenon for about 10 minutes (our lunch period had ended), durning which this formation of objects moved from the northern sky to the sky just south of us.;40.3969;-111.7919
Light Clusters Passing Overhead.;2019-08-20 22:00:00;60-90 minutes;Light Clusters Passing Overhead While sitting outside on the patio we noticed clusters of light passing us overhead.  They were in a V-Formation, like the way that birds travel.  However, the objects emit light independently.  The objects flew overhead individually as a single craft, but sometimes in pairs or even groups of three.  At one point two of these formations separated when an airplane passed it.  The objects also varied in size and the altitude at which they traveled.  Not sure what to make of it.  Upon research the lights resemble that of the “Lubbock Lights”.;40.3969;-111.7919
