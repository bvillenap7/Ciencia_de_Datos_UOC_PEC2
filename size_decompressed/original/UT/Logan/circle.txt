Orange lights in the sky;2012-11-02 21:18:00;1 minute;Orange lights in the sky I went out to let the dogs inside and saw 6-8 bright orange lights low in the sky, but arranged like a constellation.   I was fascinated and watched them moved around a little almost like a satellite, but there was no pattern and they always moved back.   After about 30 secs I went to get my camera and when I came back outside (15secs later) all but 4 had dissppeared.  I watched as the last 4 slowly faded away.;41.7552255434782;-111.820095652174
