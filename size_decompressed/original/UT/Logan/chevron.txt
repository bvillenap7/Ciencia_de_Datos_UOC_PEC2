My wife and I were walking on a quiet street.  It was nighttime and I noticed something moving in the sky above me.   I looked at my wife and then we both looked up and saw a chevron shaped dark image in the sky with subtle glowing orange lights spaced around it.   It moved quickly and silently from southwest to northeast, disappearing sooner that it should have.   I would note the event with extreme silence, almost as if we were watching a shadow move across the night sky with the subtle lights allowing us to discern its shape.   I would guess that it was lower than typical flight patterns, as this same portion of the sky is in the path of life flight helicopters that come to the local hospital.   I would estimate 200 - 300 feet in the air.;41.7552255434782;-111.820095652174
