This happened years ago but I didn't think much of it until I started noting that many of the reports are of these triangular aircraft.  It all started after my two friends and myself were walking out of Dry Canyon right above Logan, Utah after hiking and having a simple cookout.  The night sky was clear and we could see miles in all directions as you can in the desert on clear nights such as this.  We were on the way home.  No car was necessary as Logan is within walking distance of the Wasatch National Forest.  I was talking to one of my friends when the other pointed over my shoulder and said, What is that?  His voice had a timber that leant to the urgency of his exclaimation.  I turned in the direction that he was pointing. SSW.  I saw a triangular craft moving slowly in our direction.  It fit the descriptions that I have been reading on this forum.  It was triangular with 4 lights.  Three small lights at the tips and one large light in the center that seemed to slightly illuminate the ground.  It flew directly over us at about 1000 ft and we were illuminated slightly as the large central light passed over us.  It made no sound.  There were two smaller craft at each wing tip that could not be discerned except by there dark outlines.  If you were to gauge their relative sizes, I would say they were approximatly the size of a minivan next to a bowing 747.  The three craft went over us and continued NNE until we lost them in the night sky.  The silence of the craft was earie.  After some reflection on what we had seen, we thought it was simply a new form of military aircraft practicing bombing runs over Logan as Hill AFB is located near Ogden, Utah.  I am also a skeptic considering I am a scientist and yet I have yet to see a craft such as this in any of the military arsenal since.  This makes the encounter all the more interesting.

We saw 5 triangular objects moving at high altitude to the south, circling each other like small birds.;1998-10-01 00:00:00;a few minutes;We saw 5 triangular objects moving at high altitude to the south, circling each other like small birds. We were at a late night Live Action Role Playing (LARP) event with several friends.  The three of us were off to the side, having a private conversation.  I looked up at the partly cloudy sky, and in a clearing almost directly above us, I saw five bright triangles moving quickly to the south.  I pointed them out to my two friends, who also saw them before they dissapeared from sight.  They appeared to me to be about the size of air superiority fighters (F-15's) at a very high altitude.  They flew in a formation close to a single file line, with a slight curve.  The back object would speed up to take the lead position.  As soon as it did, the new rear object would do the same, and so forth.  They appeared to have the maneuverability of small birds, such as sparrows.;41.7552255434782;-111.820095652174
Triangular craft defined by five dim lights moves to the North over my head without making a sound;2005-04-26 22:50:00;5-10 Seconds;Triangular craft defined by five dim lights moves to the North over my head without making a sound While stargazing and after watching a jet fly over, I saw a series of five very dim lights creating a triangular pattern. This pattern seemed to make a solid triangular object with three of the lights making the three corners and two more extending from the leading edge apex light of the triangle.  The object made no sound as it passed over head heading North at a fast pace, well away from the aircraft I witnessed moments before, over the local university and then I lost sight of it as it passed over the hill behind my residence.  The object seemed to be flying at about 10,000 to 15,000 feet, but it was difficult to determine an actual atltitude since it was dark.  The jet I witnessed before was at crusing altitude (30,000 to 35,000 feet) and was 45 degrees from my position. The object I witnessed was directly overhead.;41.7552255434782;-111.820095652174
Going back home and saw large, triangular, light, stationary over home.;2012-05-24 23:55:00;5 minutes;Going back home and saw large, triangular, light, stationary over home. Riding bike back from work and could see this triangular, light object hovering over golf course near my town home.  It was stationary and did not make a sound.  I ran into my roommates room and told him to come outside.  When We came out it was gone. We watched the skies for another 15 minutes to see if we could sight it again.;41.7552255434782;-111.820095652174
