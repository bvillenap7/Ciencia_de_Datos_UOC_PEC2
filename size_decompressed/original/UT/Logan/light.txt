At first, it seemed to be stationary, but 20 minutes later, it appeared to have moved slightly to the Northeast.  Also observed a small plane coming into Logan Airport.  The plane had blinking lights and moved under the bright object, causing the object to appear to be much father out in space than the plane.  The plane seemed to be making a routine landing at the airport.  It is now 22:15 and observation of the light continues.;41.7552255434782;-111.820095652174

Judging by t;2012-09-13 09:00:00;4 minutes;I think it was a pair of large military jets similar to a c-17 but I am only guessing by the load sound of the jet engine. Judging by the strobes There were at least two jets flying in a straigt line due south approximatley 1/4 mile apart at near or about 15,000 feet from sea level. They were maybe flying around 380-400mph or so. Hill field is an hours drive from here however, in my 30 plus years of living here I have never seen a commercial or military plane take this route or fly this low unless it was on the fourth of july for a fly over. Also the planes did not head back to the base they continued on a southerly course. I am just curious as to why they were flying where they were and why were there two of them. The activity is just a bit strange from what I had seen in the past. Wonder if anybody knows what they were up to?;41.7552255434782;-111.820095652174
Bright red blinking object with a vapor trail holding pefectly still.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of planets?  PD));2015-11-01 03:00:00;3 hours;Bright red blinking object with a vapor trail holding pefectly still. The object was blinking a red light on and off very steadily.  It had a vapor trail, and appeared to have a flag-like object coming off of it.   I know for a fact it was not a twinkling star or an airplane or helicopter, I am a private pilot and know how to identify these. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of planets?
