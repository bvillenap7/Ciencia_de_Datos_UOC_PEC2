Noticed what seemed to be a string of red lights going from east to west in a very slow fashion with no noise at all.   About five to ten minutes later another set came by going East to West very slowly.  All 25 people in my company came out to look and we tried taking pictures, but our cameras would shut off.   My pictures seem to catch what seems to be electrical charges in odd shapes,;39.6733;-110.8582
