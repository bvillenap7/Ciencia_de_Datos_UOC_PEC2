Round UFO sighting in Zion Canyon;2013-01-01 20:30:00;1 minute;Round UFO sighting in Zion Canyon I had just been discussing theories on the possibility of how UFOs can so easily move in all directions with my boyfriend when I looked out of the front windshield and saw the craft.   At the time my boyfriend was looking in the rear view mirror and did not see the craft. We were driving to my mom's house and passed a man standing on the road looking up at the stars.  We made a joke he had probably never seen stars.   Looking back I think he may have been looking at the craft.  Out the front windshield of the truck I saw a round craft with 6 lights- from left to right: 4 red, 1 white, 1 red light.  The craft was hovering just above the cottonwood trees approximately 60-70 feet in the air.  I yelled out to my boyfriend if he was seeing what I was and to drive forward to get a better look!  Then it was gone in a blink and he missed it.;37.1862;-113.0139
