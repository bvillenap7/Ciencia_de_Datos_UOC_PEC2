Southern Utah sceptic reporting cloaking UFO in hopes someone else saw it;2016-11-22 21:00:00;30 seconds;Southern Utah sceptic reporting cloaking UFO in hopes someone else saw it Sometime between 9pm and 11 o'clock pm, I saw this semi close or low to the ground un-identified flying object.  The UFO was silent and had three dim lights in a straight row. Visually it appeared about the size of a dime or nickel making this my first and closest appearance.  I know it wasn't a plane as it's proximity to the ground would have been audible.  It seemed to cloak rather than speed off.  It went dark in a area of clear sky well below any horizon.  Not a satellite.  My explanation for this is usually a reflection from the moving horizon sun on a satellite.  I can't use this excuse here.  Too cold outside to be  reasonably a drone user.  Too high as well.  It was 52 degrees outside.  It had rained that morning with thunder and lightning.;37.1332;-113.6731
