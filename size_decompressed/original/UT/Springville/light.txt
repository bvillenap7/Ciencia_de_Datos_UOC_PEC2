Three (3) red circular lights in sky north of Springville, Utah;2012-05-28 22:02:00;6;Three (3) red circular lights in sky north of Springville, Utah At home after returning from a family barbecue around 10:02 PM, and after we got the kids out the car, I looked up in the northern sky and saw three red lights that looked like red stars in a vertical row spaced almost evenly apart.  They were high in the sky and were not moving.  They were not attached to any visible structure.  They were reddish in color and the same size as stars.  Each of the three was the same size.  It was an amazing and strange sight.  It looked just like the “red lights” UFO sightings many have seen around the world and which there is video of on You Tube.  I did not have my regular glasses and ran into get them.  My wife and son remained outside and watched them.  When I returned outside 2 minutes later as I could not locate my glasses, my wife and son said the lights just extinguished.  They did not fly away, but disappeared suddenly.  I was amazed that we had seen this sight and wished I would have had a video camera.   This is the second strange light sighting I have seen in the sky in the past few years.  I am sure there is an explanation, but in my mind I do not know what they could be.  We then went inside and went to bed.;40.1636;-111.5998
