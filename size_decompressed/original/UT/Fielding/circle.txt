It was a circle with a line of light -o- just like this.  They were bight and continuous which continued for 15 minutes until out of sight.   There was also at least 8 aircraft in the sky as well.   This also happened around the 13th oct 2015 so this is 2x we have noticed it.   I tried getting pics but I'm unable to see anything.;41.8094;-112.1229
