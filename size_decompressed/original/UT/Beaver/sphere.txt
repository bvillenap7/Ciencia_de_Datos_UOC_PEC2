Bluish Orb in Beaver Utah over Hwy I-15.  ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flare, caused by pointing camera at the Sun.  PD));2017-11-26 11:44:00;1 minute;Bluish Orb in Beaver Utah over Hwy I-15 My family and I were on Hwy I-15 on our way back to California from Park City, Utah, where we had spent the Thanksgiving holiday.  My girlfriend decided to take some pictures of the horizon and positioned the camera on the dashboard to take a few pictures. After snapping four or five shots, she looked at the photos.  She then asked me, “What’s that?”  There was what looked like a bluish orb in 3 of the photos.  One of the photos has what is either a glare in the windshield or an actual white UFO high in the sky.  Funny thing is, we hadn’t seen anything prior to taking the photos. Hopefully, someone can explain what we saw.;38.2812;-112.6317
