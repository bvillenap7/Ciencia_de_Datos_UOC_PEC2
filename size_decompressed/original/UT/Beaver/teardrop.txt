Traveling north on I-15, in Utah.  Teardrop shaped object appeared to left of freeway, and appeared to have a very shiny, chromelike surface.  I watched it, trying to figure out what it was as it hovered there in the sky.  Then, after staring at it for about 30 seconds, it darted into a nearby cloud, extrememly fast from a hovering position. I watched the cloud intently for about 30 minutes, wishing it would come out, and it did not. I was not afraid, which surprised me, and found myself just staring and wishing it would come out so I could see it again.  It almost felt like it knew I was watching, and then darted in to a cloud to hide. (Wierd, I know.)  Feel free to contact me if you wish.;38.2812;-112.6317
