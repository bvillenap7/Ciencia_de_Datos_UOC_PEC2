Bright Stationary object in the sky above Beaver Utah during early morning 8:40 AM;2008-11-14 08:40:00;10 Minutes;Bright Stationary object in the sky above Beaver Utah during early morning 8:40 AM I was driving from Las Vegas to Denver Colorado.  I do this route frequently as I am a test driver for Roush Industries.   I was on Interstate 15 going north towards Beaver Utah. Approximately 20 miles south of Beaver Utah. I was just past the intersection of I-15 and Utah 20.  I was on the phone with my mom as she is elderly and I call her every day.  I noticed high in the sky in front of me and slightly to my left a shiny object in the sky.  As I first saw it I thought it was an airplane with the sun shining off of it.  I glanced back at it and noticed no vapor trail, no motion, and the shape was circular versus the shape of a plane.  Still shiny as if the sun was shining off a glass surface.  I continued to watch as I was driving. I began to explain it to my mom as I could not determine what the object was. After watching the object for about 5 minutes I decided to stop and get out with my camera so I could use the zoom lens and get a better view. I was curious because the object did not appear to have moved for more than 5 minutes. Still in the same spot, no vapor trail, no motion up-down or sideways. I pulled over and was describing it again on the phone when the phone stopped working. I assume I had just lost the connection as that area is fairly remote. I reach in my camera bag and got out my camera. I looked up and the object was still there. I got out of the car and looked up and the object had vanished. I scanned the sky, double checked my windshield to see if maybe I was looking at a spot on my window, I scanned the sky both with naked eye and then my zoom lens. Nothing. The object was gone and my phone was ringing.;38.2812;-112.6317
