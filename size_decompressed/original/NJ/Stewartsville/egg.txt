What the heck was that?;2012-10-21 05:30:00;8 seconds; What the heck was that/ Driving home from foodshopping- I noticed something out of the corner of my left eye, hovering over the far mountains.  I thought to myself, wow, thats really silver looking and not moving. I also thought it was an odd looking plane.  I then looked over to my daughter in the passenger seat to see if she was looking, which she wasnt.  I then looked back and it was gone. Later that night I was talking to my oldest about it and how weird it was, and he was shocked- His girlfriend saw the same thing, at the same time frame.  She was telling  my oldest to look at it and by the time she turned back to see it, it was gone.;40.6904;-75.1141
