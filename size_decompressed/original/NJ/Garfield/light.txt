Bright Dime size white light moving N.W - S.E. fast and NO sound.;2004-05-29 21:00:00;apx. 2 min;Bright Dime size white light moving N.W - S.E. fast and NO sound. Looking up at the moon the sky was clear and from the north west moving south east was a single bright dime size pure white light moving very fast and with no sound at all. It had no flashing I.D. lights or anything else just the plain white light the size of a dime. I have never witnessed any type of light like this in the sky even after many years of sky watching. I thought maybe it was a man made object but do to the size,color,speed and NO SOUND and hight it was flying I really don't think it was man made.;40.88;-74.1031
