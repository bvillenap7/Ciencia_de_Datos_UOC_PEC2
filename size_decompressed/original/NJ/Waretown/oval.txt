5 orange lights formed in perfect line southeast on Rt. 9 in Waretown NJ;2011-03-11 22:33:00;Seconds;5 orange lights formed in perfect line southeast on Rt. 9 in Waretown NJ I was driving south on Rt. 9, a route I take about 4 times a week at this time, and looked up in the sky to the southeast over the treelike and saw 5 bright orange yellow lights formed in a perfect line and perfectly spaced.  I was amazed! I unfortunately was driving and started to slow down and had to look back at the road and when I looked back up they were gone. My mind raced to find a rational explanation but could not come up with one. It was way to high for street lights, and to was not planes.  There was no sound at all but it seemed far away so no sound didn't seem out of place. Regardless something that I will never forget and the date burns in mind because it was the same day of the big earthquake in Japan.
