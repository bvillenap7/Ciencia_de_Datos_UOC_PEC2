Low-flying light formation hovers and then disappears.;2020-01-06 21:20:00;3 minutes;Low-flying light formation hovers and then disappears. Hazy/blurry light form in a semi-teardrop shape flying East. My husband and I first noticed object as it came across Bonita Road, traveling quickly toward the bay.  Object appeared extremely large and was flying low.  Once it passed over our neighbor's rooftop the object stopped, hovered in midair, and then slowly began to disappear before our eyes in a dissolving-like fashion.  An airplane was seen in the sky about three minutes later, traveling at much higher altitude.  It did not appear that the airplane was chasing the object.;39.7889;-74.1982
