Brilliant Illumination, hovering in night sky.  2 other discs flying around.;2016-02-03 22:00:00;10 minutes;Brilliant Illumination, hovering in night sky.  2 other discs flying around. Looking out at around 10:00pm we saw 3 discs or UFO's in the sky NE direction 2 were smaller and less light the other one was hovering and glowing/pulsating/sparkling and strobing very bright white light the other 2 were flying near the larger one and then started moving out towards the ocean east and away the bright one stayed awhile longer just hovering not moving.  My other witness said that it also looked suspicious and not anything seen before.   This is the same area that I've seen many times where bright lights hover in place for at least 10-30 minutes and then just disappear.  We happen to live near the ocean east of us.  In the summer, at around 5:00pm, sun was still out & clear sky,   I was standing out with neighbor we both saw it and we saw a plane in the same direction coming from the South going North with an orb (whitish) going at a great speed flying in and out criss-crossing behind the plane.  I was in awe as I was with this latest sighting.  I never saw UFO's before until living in this area.  We have a nuclear plant nearby so maybe that has something to do with the attraction;39.7889;-74.1982
