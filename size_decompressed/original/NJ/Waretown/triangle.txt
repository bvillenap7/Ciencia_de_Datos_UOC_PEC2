We were in the pool and happened to see something in the sky.   It was very close to the ground and when you looked at it closely it was definitely not an airplane or jet of any type.  The lights were bright orange and white.   Not only was the object a triangular shape, the noise differed completely then airplanes and jets.;39.7889;-74.1982
