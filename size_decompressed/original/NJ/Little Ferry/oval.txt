It was not very high in the sky infact it ws just over the top of these tall trees. I was scared and i kept watching it to see where it would go. The lioght ws so bright it almost hurt my eyes like a big spot light almost all of a sudden it started to move but downward like it would land. Just before it touched the top of the tree it stopped. I got the feeling something inside was looking around for something. It made not a sound the bright light was steady never changed. It then started to move towards the south of me very slowly. When it got a distance away it just dropped out of sight. I ran inside and I did not go out the rest of the night. It was very eerie and I almost felt like someone or something was watching me watch them.;40.8485;-74.0357
