It wasn't a plane, and there were 3 of them.  They were very sleek, reflective and bright, like the bulb of a lamp.  I couldn't focus my eyes on the actual shape.  They flew high in the sky to the side of my car before going overhead and forward into the clouds.;39.7505000000001;-75.3323

It was raining and the skies were grey with clouds and not much sunlight. It appeared to be cigar shaped,stationary and also very bright like glowing white. I looked around looking for the sun but no sun for this thing to reflect any light from. As I kept driving to get onto the highway for two seconds the object went behind the treeline and just disappeared. I was on the phone with my fianc√© and I told her what I saw right away.;39.7505000000001;-75.3323
