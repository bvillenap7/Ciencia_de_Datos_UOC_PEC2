At a few miles distant, I observed no object, only a very bright white light.  No fluctuation in intensity, no blinking, no twinkling.  No sound.  Disappearance during a quite glance at my watch to record the time since this was such an unusual event. While standing on the beach at sunup, while still able to see starts, I observed a bright light that I initially considered to be a planet, only much brighter.  Eventually the light starting moving as if an aircraft was traveling towards me and veering away.  It began to accelerate rapidly and disappeared during the time of a quick glance at my watch. There was no sound, no wind. There was a band of clouds on the horizon, although I was able to see stars above me.  It was gradually getting lighter, although the light was distinctively different than a planet or star. There were no other typical hints of it being an aircraft, e.g. extra red light, or blinking light.;38.969;-74.9167000000001
i fast moving red light, turned to blue, changed direction then turned white and it was gone!!!!;2011-02-12 01:55:00;5 seconds;i fast moving red light, turned to blue, changed direction then turned white and it was gone!!!!  500 Lights On Object0: Yes It was around 1:55 am, I went out front to smoke a cig, I just happened to look into the sky in the south,  It was a clear night, with many stars in the sky,  I saw a red light at very high altitude, it was moving fast and with changes in course that NO MAN MADE aircraft could do,  it was first glowing red, then seemed to turn blue,  then make a 90 degree turn,  then turned into a white light and vanished.   the whole thing took place over maybe 5-10 seconds,  I have seen shooting stars and aircraft before,  IT WAS NONE OF THESE,  i am 100% sure..  something I have NEVER seen anything like this before,  the way it changed course,  changed speed and color,  I was left scratching my head...  please feel free to contact me for more info…;38.969;-74.9167000000001
It was decently close and silent, it disappeared and reappeared and was bright red and moved around the sky in an unexplainable way.;2014-08-09 22:45:00;5 minutes;It was decently close and silent, it disappeared and reappeared and was bright red and moved around the sky in an unexplainable way. It was decently close and silent and it disappeared and reappeared and was bright red and didn't have blinking lights like a plane and it totally moved around in the sky in a weird/unexplainable way until it disappeared into the distance(although it actually seemed more like it vanished because I it didn't seem to fly away until it was gone.) It actually was heading right towards us, but totally turned away and seemed be moving slowing in an unexplainable way.  it was indeed pretty far away.  We saw it over a cornfield, but I think not directly over i.   It seams to dim from bright red to white. I filmed it but it's essentially just a pixelated red dot in the sky.   I also later saw a plane go past about where the ufo was and I could hear the sound of the plane in the distance even father from where the ufo had been, but the ufo still made no sound when I saw it earlier.

Having 3 million air miles under my belt and an engineering degree, I am fairly aware of the abilities of aircraft, satellites, and helicoptors. the flight pattern of this body followed none of those expected patterns.

Red dancing light. Then multiple flashing lights. Extremely silent. Three military helicopters on scene. Air tasted like perfume.;2020-03-04 21:00:00;1 hour;Red dancing light. Then multiple flashing lights. Extremely silent.  Three military helicopters on scene. Air tasted like perfume. Saw “red dancing light” thought coast guard was experimenting with flares.  Then saw 50 or so “blinking” lights moving from East to West, and into another huge pale yellow “orb” three military helicopters on site as well.  One hovering low directly above lake in front of us, two behind us on either side of the lighthouse. Air was extremely heavy. Air tasted like musk. Old perfume.  Extremely heavy taste in mouth.  Thought we were being sprayed. Called the coast guard and sent videos.  Contacted the FAA with same information. Both said there was nothing in the videos worth investigating. I have videos, but reluctant to share, as I said my friends name in one of them.  But I will share if asked.  My friend and I both watched for over an hour.  Then felt very, very disoriented. My friend and I are 31 year old life long residents of this area.  Have seen many “arial phenomena” but nothing I’ve ever felt the need to report.  Until now.;38.969;-74.9167000000001
