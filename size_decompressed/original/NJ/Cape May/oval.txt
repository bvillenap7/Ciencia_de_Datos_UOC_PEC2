Large cluster of red orbs.;2014-09-28 05:00:00;2 minutes;Large cluster of red orbs. We were heading out to the Wilmington Canyon on a fishing trip around 5 am.  I was on watch looking north, when I noticed a bunch of large red circles in the distant sky, which were as bright as red fireworks that had just exploded and just stayed in one spot.  There were about 16-20 in a close pattern, and another 8 or so, spread out slightly to the left.   The lights didn't seem to go out, but seemed to move away toward the north until we couldn't see them anymore.   They were way bigger than the stars and the planets but a lot smaller than a typical moon.  It was a perfectly clear night this happened about 25-50 miles east of Atlantic City, over the ocean.   I woke up one of the other guys who verified it was there.  Both of the observers are Coast Guard licensed captains and have never seen anything like this before. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE)) Peter, The date was Sept 28 2014 at approximately 5am. Also we did not call the hotline. As you saw, I listed 3 people seeing the orbs, the 3rd person saw the red but doesn't have very good vision. It was a gorgeous deep ruby red. ((END ADDENDUM));38.969;-74.9167000000001
Small lightening bolt that changed form to a perfect zero with purple flares.;2018-11-11 00:15:00;Hours;Small lightening bolt that changed form to a perfect zero with purple flares. Took the telescope out.  It was 12:15 in the morning.  I saw a yellow “star.”  This object was only visible through my telescope.  This object was moving erratically.  In all different directions and looked like a small lightning bolt that didn’t go out.  However, multiple times this object would widen itself and make the shape of a perfect zero.  And when it was the shape of a zero, purple flares would shoot out of it. And it was so fast.  It never stopped moving.  About 2 hours afterwards, I checked again and it was still there.  Only much, much smaller.  I’m hesitant to share the exact location of this.  It was, very peculiar.   I’ve been taking my telescope out for over 10 years.  Never saw anything like this.  I’ve seen comets, planets, satellites, everything.  This, is unexplainable.;38.969;-74.9167000000001
