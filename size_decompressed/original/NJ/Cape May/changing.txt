From Cape May, N/J/ the object appeared to be far out over the, Delaware Bay, at first seemed to have a bird like movement, as it moved in a north west direction.  Upon closer observation, 10x binoculars, the object seemed to take on the characteristics of a yellow colored blimp, partially deflated and out of control, moving at an undertimed rate of speed. From ground observation, it seemed rather slow as it remained visible for a length of time.;38.969;-74.9167000000001
