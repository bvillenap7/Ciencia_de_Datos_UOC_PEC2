highly reflective cylinder;2010-07-01 17:30:00;30 seconds;highly reflective cylinder Date of Observation:  1 July 2010  Time of Observation:  5:30 pm Duration of Observation: 30 seconds Location of Observation:  On the Beach, Cape May, New Jersey. This Beach is located next to the intersection of Beach Avenue and Madison   Type of UFO: highly reflective metallic cylinder, about the length of a passenger airliner  I was lying on the beach perhaps 25 feet from the ocean.  I was taking in the warmth and sunshine on the beach and sometimes watching the high overhead airliners inbound and outbound from Jersey and Philadelphia airports.  I then spotted a very shiny cylinder inbound towards the beach and almost directly overhead.  As I watched the cylinder I could not see any wings.   Then bang, the cylinder was now moving 90 degrees to its right and parallel to the beach.  Then the cylinder disappeared suddenly yet, the sky was clear and very sunny.  I said to myself, this was no ordinary aircraft.  I was at Cape May for two weeks and saw many aircraft inbound and outbound both during the day and evening  but nothing like this shiny cylinder.;38.969;-74.9167000000001
