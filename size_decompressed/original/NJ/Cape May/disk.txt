Neon-Blue Disk w/ Many Lights on Bottom Seen Over Cape May Beach;2004-08-03 22:30:00;3 seconds;Neon-Blue Disk w/ Many Lights on Bottom Seen Over Cape May Beach My husband and I were on vacation, sitting on a bench on the beach in Cape May talking and out of the corner of my eye, I caught sight of a neon-blue disk that looked like a childs sand sifter with thousands of holes which were illuminated with white light. It passed by extremely fast and disappeared behind what looked like it should have been a cloud, but there were none out that evening.  The sky was clear and full of stars.  The size was relative to a full moon.  The moon was not out that evening.  I did not hear any sound with seeing the object. About ten minutes later, I saw a shooting star and in comparison, this did not even come close.  This traveled horizontally and extremely smooth and fast, whereas the shooting star dipped and fell. I have never seen anything in the sky like this before. It was definitely too fast to be an airplane and the neon-blue/lights as well as fact that it disappeared made me frightened at first, but then curious so I sat there for another half an hour hoping to see something else.  Nothing.  I have been doing all kinds of research since I returned home and I am interested in knowing if anyone has seen an object resembling the one I have seen.  Thank you for your time, ((name deleted));38.969;-74.9167000000001

Black Craft  broad daylight at the beach, captured in photo, no one saw it at the time.;2010-08-05 13:00:00;seconds;Black Craft  broad daylight at the beach, captured in photo, no one saw it at the time. Spent a day at the beach in Cape May, NJ, on the Delaware Bay side about a mile north of the Cape May/Lewis Ferry. Snapped a photo of a friend riding my wave runner. 3 Days later went to share on-line discovered a black saucer shaped something in the sky above him. Bit of a motion blur.  Not a plane not a blimp not a bird not a hellicopter.  No one yet has a plausable explanation for what it is. Picture is still on my storage card for my digital camera. You can't transferr files from a computer on to the card.  The only way to get a pic on the card is to take a picture. I assume whatever it was, it was moving very fast cause no one saw it at the time.  Lots of people on the beach.;38.969;-74.9167000000001
