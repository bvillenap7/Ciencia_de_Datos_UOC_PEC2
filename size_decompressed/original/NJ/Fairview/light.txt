Star like object flying around the moon.;2008-09-07 20:00:00;1 minute;Star like object flying around the moon. While in my car and stopped at a red light I glance up at the moon tonight which was bright and out with clear skies only to notice an objects which looked exactly like a star in the night sky would near the moon, except this object was moving very slow above the moon.  To me it was moving to slow to be an airplane and was to far (or to high) for it to be an airplane.  As I mentioned it looked exactly like a star in the sky.  It crossed above the moon then it seemed as it moved away further into space until it just vanished.  It never moved across the sky, it just stayed near the moon.;40.8162;-73.9996000000001
