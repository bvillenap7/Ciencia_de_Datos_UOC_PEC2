A flying globe looking object.;1977-07-17 15:00:00;30 seconds;A flying globe looking object. I was with about 4 friends when one of them yelled UFO!   Everyone ran, but I jumped up on a large man hole set maybe 3 feet higher then level ground to get a better look.   I was facing west and seen a object traveling east it is hard to judge the height but it was not very high maybe three thousand feet give or take a thousand.   The object was traveling maybe 90 miles an hour but that's a guess.   Also the object was about 50 yards high and fifty yards wide it was a fairly perfect circle.   The way it looked was odd, picture a globe but tan not blue with patches of brown where the land would be and add something spinning on top maybe a light of some kind.   That is what was in the sky that day.  It look like a fly planet!;40.8162;-73.9996000000001
