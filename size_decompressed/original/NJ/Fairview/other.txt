Unknown silent silver object seen moving randomly over NJ and New York City;2008-04-14 13:30:00;10 minutes;Unknown silent silver object seen moving randomly over NJ and New York City While waiting for a bus in Fairview, NJ, I observed a silver object for around 10 minutes at 1:30 p.m., moving slowly over the Hudson River and New York City.  It at first looked like a plane, but the object seemed to rotate back and forth.  Its exact shape was hard to make out.  It was not a bird, since it reflected sunlight.  The object moved silently in a random pattern, moving left to right and up and down without any trajectory.  It changed its altitude several times, going from what seemed to be about 1,000 feet to 10,000 feet within 15 seconds, at times coming down to around 5,000 feet.  It hovered high over New York City, and then was out of sight (I was on a bus and could not follow it without getting off).;40.8162;-73.9996000000001
