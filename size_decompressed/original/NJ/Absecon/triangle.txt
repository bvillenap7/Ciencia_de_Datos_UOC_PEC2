White triangle shape no lites or sound moving NNE in night sky.;2011-10-15 20:30:00;5-10 seconds;White triangle shape no lites or sound moving NNE in night sky. While floating in hot tub, witnessed triangle shaped object moving silently in sky to the North-Northeast.  Object appeared to be white in color, only lit by ambient light of surroundings.  First thought it to be maybe a snow goose way up in sky, so concentrated on any wing movement.  There was none. Moving somewhat faster than planes also flying in that general direction that night.  Object had NO LIGHTS of it's own.  Completely silent too.  Altitude as high as planes or maybe a little higher. 60,000'.  Also had to be quite large.  Somewhat bigger than commercial jet airliner.;39.4486717948718;-74.4752423076923
