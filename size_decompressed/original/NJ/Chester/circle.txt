Seven UFO's zigzagging in formation across the night sky;1997-11-15 23:00:00;3-4 minutes;Seven UFO's zigzagging in formation across the night sky I was working as a ((deleted--employee)) in a ((deleted name)) building on the Dover/Chester road outside Chester, NJ.   I was on my own doing ((deleted)) outside the building when I came back and happened to look up in the sky.  It was a very clear night, no clouds and cold.   I saw these circles high up in the sky (I would estimate the altitude to be higher than where airplanes fly).  They were zigzagging across the sky from a direction north to south (from the Dover, NJ direction toward Chester, NJ) in formation.  It was the strangest thing I ever saw or I believe I will ever see.   I stood there not believing what I was seeing and it was about 3 to 4 minutes that I stood there watching this.  The only thing I regret was that I didn't call back to our base in Morristown saying what I was seeing since I had a walkie talkie with me.  I reported this on the nuforc.org site.  To this day I believe they were UFO's since it couldn't have been comets or asteroids and I don't think they were military craft of any sort doing these strange manuevers at night that high up in the night sky.& ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
