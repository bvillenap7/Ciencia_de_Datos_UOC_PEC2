I saw a disc-shaped object that appeared to be dark-colored or shadowed on the bottom. It appeared much smaller than a plane or a helicopter.  It was much larger than a bird.  It appeared to be wobbling across the sky, rather than moving smoothly.  It appeared in the north and proceeded south until out of view.  All that could be seen was the bottom of the object.;40.7881;-74.675
