The objects were completely black and seemed to float. They maintained proximity of each other. The best description would be something like a plastic bag floating or a very light burnt paper, but we could see they were definitely not bags or papers. Initially we thought they were birds but quickly realized they werenâ€™t. No wings, no defined shape, no flying. Just gently flowing in the sky going up and away from us.;40.5921;-74.6238000000001
