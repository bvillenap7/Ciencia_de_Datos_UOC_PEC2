Two tube-shaped bars or cylinders floating over Route 22.;2016-06-17 12:15:00;3-5 minutes;Two tube-shaped bars or cylinders floating over Route 22. Two bar-shaped (or tube-shaped) cylinders appeared to be floating over Route 22 in Bridgewater, NJ.  Seemed to be moving in a random fashion, but drifting slowly westward.  No discernible method of propulsion.  Height and size difficult to estimate but I would guess 800-1000 foot elevation.  Much darker and narrower than blimps.;40.5921;-74.6238000000001
