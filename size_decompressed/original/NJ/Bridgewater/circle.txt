3 craft in offset formation fly over Bridgewater, NJ;2005-12-17 21:17:00;2 seconds;3 craft in offset formation fly over Bridgewater, NJ Well, hate to say it, but yes, I too saw my FIRST unexplained object(s) on December 17th, 2005, about 4 weeks ago at 21:17PM. I was outside my townhouse on the lowest level. Now for viewing I get a northward peep and I'm able to spot polaris for alignment.  It was one of those cold, slightly windy nights so I would stay out for a few minutes and observe, and then come in the slider to warm up for a couple minutes and go outside again. (because I was close to the warmth and wasn't dressed really properly)   On about the third time I went outside and looked up I got a glimpse of three objects, moving very quickly from north-south zoom over our townhouse complex. I saw the objects for perhaps 2 seconds as they passed through my FOV visually. I ran upstairs and out the front door but at the speed they were travelling I knew I'd never catch a glimpse. This is what I know I observed about these objects:  1. There was three of them 2. They were all travelling at the same speed 3. Two of them were closer then the third in the formation 4. There was no blinking lights 5. They made NO sound as they passed overhead 6. They had a orangish glow about them 7. They flew very fast 8. Altitude was NOT determinable   Now because I see planes ALL the time in this area I know exactly what one looks like, and these objects were NOT anything like an airplane. I was very skeptical about the existence of REAL UFO's, and now I'm not so sure they don't exist.......just kind of freaked me out.....;40.5921;-74.6238000000001
