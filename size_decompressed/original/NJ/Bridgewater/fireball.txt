flaming moving object in NJ;2011-10-16 01:30:00;1 minute;flaming moving object in NJ I was driving east on Route 22 in Bridgwater, NJ at about 1:30 am and all of a sudden i see an orange light come from the east, as i got closer i can see that this object was on fire, so i pull over my car and this flaming object is hovering over route 22, this object was anywhere between 500-1000 feet above route 22 and then it started to move in sporadic directions at a quick speed then flew to a higher altitude and then faded away....   This object was visible for about 1 minute, there was no sound, no flaming debri was coming off the object, it was something on fire that moved on its own....The temperature is about 58 degrees no wind with overcast....The size of the object was hard to judge if i had to take a guess i would say the size of a motorcycle maybe even biggerâ€¦;40.5921;-74.6238000000001
I clearly witnessed a craft on fire that cruised over my house in a steady direction slow down then get smaller and disappear.;2013-11-30 19:00:00;3 minutes;I clearly witnessed a craft on fire that cruised over my house in a steady direction slow down then get smaller and disappear. While watching the Alabama/Auburn at 19:00 hrs I saw out my window what looked like an airplane on fire I could tell by the way it was moving something wasn't right as in what you would see in a airplane crashing.  The object just kept moving in a steady pace same altitude while on fire-I could see the flames clearly from my window.  Being about 25 miles from Newark airport we are in the flight path of the airlines and see planes fly over constantly and this was not an airplane.  At this time I grabbed my iPad and ran out my front door to video the object which I did while screaming for the rest of the family to come outside and witness the object.  The object flew directly over my house and we all could very clearly see that the object was under control flying westward and what looked like flames surrounding the craft.  It was a awesome sight beautiful actually.  The night was cloudy,after the craft passed us it traveled probably a mile definitely slowed down  then seemed to ascend get smaller and smaller then disappear.;40.5921;-74.6238000000001
