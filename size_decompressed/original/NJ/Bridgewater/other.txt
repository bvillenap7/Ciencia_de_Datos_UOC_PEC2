With no shape to Fly;2000-09-24 23:45:00;1 minute;With no shape to Fly After I finished my partime at Bridgewater town and my first time in that town, I was driving over Washington Valley Rd. looking for the route 78 for comeback home (Roselle town) I past the street becacause there is not  sign that shows the route 78 so I did the U turn for to try find my street again suddenly I saw a Light like  big very pointed star in the first time I thought was some tower or post over the hill, but the light was moving from left to right ,impossible to be a airplane, really the light was moving slow, so I stoped my car also I thought that probably my windshield was blurry and showed the light so big, but when I got out of my car really was a big light flying and when the light crossed almost over me I saw the side of the objet, looked like heavy with no shape to fly, no wings, flat the front the same like the back, reds and green little lights blinking across of the side of the objet doing a very little noise like smood whistling, I din't see the color was a dark objet flying slow and low, I cleaned my eyes, I couln't believed, when the objet past I did again the U turn to try to see more, I was following the objet but the objet fade away behind the trees and I did a left turn to try follow it, I din't find it but  Ironic I found the Route 78, I din't feel scare but tears started to come from my eyes in that moment was a feeling with no explanation, later almost in my home I saw a police car, really I thought two times to ask them, but I did it I ask then If some body did some report or complaint about UFO's over Bridgewater town, they called to ask but nothing, but also they made funny about me, But I was expecting that really is so difficult to believe.;40.5921;-74.6238000000001
Exceptionally bright lights turned night time to day time for 4 min;2011-11-23 12:35:00;3 min;exceptionally bright lights turned night time to day time for 4 min saw exceptionqlly bright light outside my bedroom window, it was not cars passing by or airplant passing through. it was like day time outside that I could see my mailbox number. then the light went to the woods ahead, there was nothing on the sky at all when I looked. it was not lightling and has no noise.  I stayed by the window for at least three min, then saw the light outside starting to change color from little green to little red. I mean the sky was so bright i thought it was day time already.  I could not figure out what type of light actually does such good job from the distants.  it turned the night sky into day time and I could not tell where was the light coming from except the woods.;40.5921;-74.6238000000001

Repeated daylight sightings of high altitude box kite shaped object over central NJ;2020-06-23 18:15:00;5 minutes;Repeated daylight sightings of high altitude box kite shaped object over central NJ For the past 2 weeks, on clear afternoons around 6:15pm something passes over central NJ at a very high altitude.  Through binoculars it looks like a silver box kite, or hourglass/ dumbbell shape, and I can just barely make it out with the naked eye.  It moves very slowly from SW to NE and catches the light from the setting sun, but one time  it seemed to be standing still and didn't move.  It could be the ISS but usually that's just a bright dot late at night, not a daytime shape with visible structure.  I've seen it 4 times in the past 2wks, don't have the right equipment to photograph it, but it's been fairly predictable.  NASA's ISS spotter website only lists nighttime flyovers.;40.5921;-74.6238000000001
