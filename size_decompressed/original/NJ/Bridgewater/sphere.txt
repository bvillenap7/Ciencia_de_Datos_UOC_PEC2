Two individials in two different localities reported seeing a large blue object about the size of a three story building going across the sky. Each witness separately provided a sketch of the object. Both sketches match almost identically in every detail even though the witnesses presumably do not know each other and have never met. Police officer receiving these reports and sketches were unable to provide any further details such as duration of sighting, direction of travel, etc. because they did not know what pertinent questions to ask.

I’m a Bridgewater, NJ, resident, saw a bright circular light in the sky yesterday around 6:30 pm while walking around my neighborhood.;2019-06-09 18:30:00;1 minute;I’m a Bridgewater, NJ, resident, saw a bright circular light in the sky yesterday around 6:30 pm while walking around my neighborhood on Vanderveer Road.  It appears to be travelling from the South East to North West,   I stopped at the corner of Ventura Drive and Vanderveer Road to observe.  The skies were very clear and I  notice this object moving across the sky.  I took out my iPhone XR and I thought that I was recording the object, but later realized that I took a picture instead of a video.   While reviewing the picture I looked up again and actually saw a second object, which I immediately started to film.  The second object comes into frame around 16/17 seconds and which may need to zoomed in a bit as it appears to be very tiny.   One thing that was noticeable was that there were no contrails, compared to the jet that comes into frame almost at the end of the video.   Could be something explainable but wanted to share in case someone else reported a similar sighting.;40.5921;-74.6238000000001
