Strange Lights Over Central Jersey 11/07/05 Manville, Bridgewater, Somerville area;2005-11-07 20:00:00;2+ hours at this point;Strange Lights Over Central Jersey 11/07/05 Manville, Bridgewater, Somerville area Around 8 PM EST, a cluster of lights was seen in the Manville-Bridgewater, NJ area.  These objects were much lower to the ground and moving much slower than traditional aircraft.  I can say this with certainty because there were planes simultaneously flying in the area (there were much higher and faster).   These objects seemed to ascent individually, one at a time.  Each ascended at an angle similar to that of a plane taking off--but this inclined ascent was done from mid-air, not from the ground.  In one instance, an ascending object appeared to come very close to a jet in the air.  After watching 2-3 do this, I lost track of the objects.   About an hour later, I saw another cluster of lights in approximately the same area of the first cluster (within several miles of each other--at the most).  This cluster more resembled a constellation than the previous one, almost like the Big Dipper where one can visually connect the objects in an ascending line.  Again, these objects were much lower to the ground and much slower moving than aircraft that was simultaneously in the same airspace.  At times, it seemed that these objects disappeared, and then reappeared shortly thereafter.  However, I did not witness the process of re-appearance because I was traveling home in a car by this point.  It is now approximately 90 minutes after I first saw this strange occurrence, and I cannot see these lights from my home.  I have never reported a UFO sighting in my life, and never before today had I ever believed I saw UFOs.  However, this occurrence was incredibly unusual, and I genuinely feel that what I witnessed was likely alien related.  I am hoping that other people in Central Jersey saw this too and will come forward as well.;40.5921;-74.6238000000001
