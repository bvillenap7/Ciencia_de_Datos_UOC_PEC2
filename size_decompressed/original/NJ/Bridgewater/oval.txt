UFO following Chemtrails in Bridgewater, New Jersey;2005-02-18 10:01:00;30 seconds;UFO following Chemtrails in Bridgewater, New Jersey I was sitting in my car watching the daily chemtrail being laid, when I saw a silver, shiny oval shape, silently traveling south over Finderne Ave in the opposite direction of the the trail, but next to it.   Then about 10 seconds later I saw a commercial aircraft following the UFO in same direction. I was able to compare the two and the were distinctly different. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the chemtrails reported above were, in fact, normal contrails behind high-altitude aircraft.  We do not know what the silver object was, but a conventional aircraft would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witness had observed a genuine UFO.
