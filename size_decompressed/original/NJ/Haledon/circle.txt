Bright red/orange circular object in the SE sky.;2014-01-12 23:30:00;10-15 minutes;Bright red/orange circular object in the SE sky. Hi. I went into my back yard around 11:10 on 1/13/2014 to stargaze with my 10x50 binoculars.  I looked around the whole sky with the naked eye to see how clear it was out there were almost no clouds out.  So I looked at the moon and the constellation Orion.   When I took the binoculars down and I looked up I noticed a very bright pulsing red/orange circular light on the upper horizon.  Automatically I knew that it wasn’t there before, my heart started beating like it was going to jump out of my chest.  I looked through my binoculars at it, the object was far away but I could tell it was circular.   As I kept staring at it, it looked as if it was bobbing up and down.  Then I thought I saw a white beam/light almost flickering under it and then out the side of the object I saw three white objects shoot out to the right and then directly up and then they were out of my vision.  The smaller objects were pea size in comparison to the main bright red/orange object.   Not too long after that the main object started moving away from its original position.  As it got farther away from me it got dimmer and dimmer, eventually in an instant it was gone and I stood there in awe of what I saw and then went inside very much scarred.   My dog was with me out there and she didn’t react in any way but the object could have been too far away.   I’ve always wanted to see something like this for myself and finally I have.  My family now thinks I’m crazy but I KNOW what I saw.   Tonight I will go outside and check again but I doubt I’ll see anything again.

Clusters of orange-colored flying objects seen over Haledon, NJ.;2015-06-03 21:45:00;8 minutes;Clusters of orange-colored flying objects seen over Haledon, NJ. I was traveling in Haledon, NJ, and made a right onto Belmont Ave. from Burhans Ave. and spotted a cluster of about 12 orange color flying objects.  There was a spacing and another cluster of 8 came behind them.   As they disappeared 2 or 3 and then single objects came up.  The single objects were traveling a lot faster as to try to catch up with the group.  They were silent and a slight halo could be seen on the clouds.   A commercial jet came by significantly higher in altitude than the objects.  I reported the incident to the Haledon police.  I took a cell phone picture of the single ones.;40.9457;-74.1826000000001
