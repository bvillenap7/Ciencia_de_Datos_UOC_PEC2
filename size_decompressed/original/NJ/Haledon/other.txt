Blue/Green Orb accompianed with Triangle object over Haledon area.;2010-11-07 12:30:00;5 minutes;Blue/Green Orb accompianed with Triangle object over Haledon area. I had just left my friend's house in Hawthorne, walking to my car when I noticed a bright blueish green orb in the sky.  At first I thought it was a star but then I realized the sky was very cloudy and I couldn't see any stars nor the moon.  I quickly got in my car and on my way home the object was still in the same position (on my right) once I got to a stop light I noticed far ahead to me, 3 amber lights in the shape of a triangle, I thought it was street lights but then I realized it was too up in the sky to be street lights.  Then when I entered the Haledon/Prospect Park area I saw that the blueish green orb had moved to that triangle object and stayed with it like they were communicating.  Once I got into the Haledon area it was hard for me to see the sky and where those objects were.  But from what I think I think they might of been hovering the North Haledon reservoir or Wanaque.  Needless to say I was extremely terrified even more terrified to pull out my phone and snap a picture or video...I couldn't sleep the rest of the night.;40.9457;-74.1826000000001
