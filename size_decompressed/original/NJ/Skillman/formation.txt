6 perfectly vertically aligned lights hovering after coming from different directions.;2017-01-19 19:00:00;10 minutes ?;6 perfectly vertically aligned lights hovering after coming  from different directions. Night sky. Looked like 6 planes converging as though they were going to crash.   Then they lined up vertically with perfect spacing in between them and hovered for at least 10 minutes.   I was driving so I don't know how long they stayed there. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be quite responsible.  We suspect that she is a reliable witness.  PD));40.4206;-74.6951
