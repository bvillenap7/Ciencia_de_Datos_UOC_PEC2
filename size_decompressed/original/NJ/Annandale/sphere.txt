weird round silver sphere like object but not a perfect sphere!;2008-07-24 17:20:00;10 sec;weird round silver sphere like object but not a perfect sphere! On the way to the banl I had seen a large very reflective silver or metal looking ball in the sky. I thought it was a balloon but it had no basket and was not shaped like a balloon. I drove a bit faster through some tree overhang and by the time I got into the clear looking in the same direction it was gone. I don't believe in UFO's but I think I had seen something that I'm not use to seeing in broad day light around 6 or 7 pm.
