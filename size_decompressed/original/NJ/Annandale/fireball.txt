Slow moving, silent orange fireball;2012-02-04 21:55:00;2 mins?;Slow moving, silent orange fireball Was outside, and noticed what looked like an orange flaming blob - moving super slow, and making zero noise...  It was generally moving on a straight trajectory, but would seem to occasionally stop or backtrack.  It eventually moved out of the range where I could see it.
