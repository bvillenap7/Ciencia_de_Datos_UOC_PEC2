star like light that moved and changed directions in hunterdon county, NJ;2010-03-31 20:00:00;5 min;star like light that moved and changed directions in hunterdon county, NJ last night march 31,2010 around 9pm, me and my friends wife went outside to walk their dog, and as soon as we walked out the front door i looked up and seen a light really high up in the sky.  It look like it was just as far as the stars and also looked like a star, but then it started to move slowly to the south for about a minute and then it just stopped and just hovered for about another min then it started to move south again for about 30 seconds, then it just totally changed direction and then was moving to the north at a very high speed for about 20 or 30 seconds, and then i just lost it and couldnt spot it anymore so then me and my friends wife went back inside... then about 10min later i went out my friends back door into the back yard and looked to the north where i last seen the star like light then i spotted it again for about 20 seconds then it was gone.;40.6287;-74.8855
