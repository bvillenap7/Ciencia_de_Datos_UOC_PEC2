Unknown bright light object;1991-06-30 00:00:00;30 secs-1min;Unknown bright light object As I drove my car up driveway, then I turned my car engine off. Suddenly, the light inside my car turned on. I looked up in the sky and suddenly saw very very bright light object (right side) behind the tree near my car.. That tree blocked my view from seeing it, but it SPED sooooo fast! It was not a fireball or meteor or falling star. I was stunned and was terrified since I never saw it before..I normally see falling stars but not like that before. The strange thing was before I saw very very light object, I had weird dreams two times about seeing very beautiful flying saucers flying around my house!
