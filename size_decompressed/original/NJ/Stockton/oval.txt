AN OVAL CRAFT CHANGES SPEED AND DIRECTION LIKE NOTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN!;2001-05-05 20:00:00;7 seconds;AN OVAL CRAFT CHANGES SPEED AND DIRECTION LIKE NOTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN! I was invited to a cinco de mayo party at a friends home. Approximately 8 p.m. that evening my wife and another person were sitting at a table on a deck overlooking the Delaware River. The other side of the river is approximately 800 feet away and a rise of trees graduates to a ridge. The direction was West. The party was in its early stages when I heard a reaction by someone to come quickly...look! I quickly ran out on the porch and looked West above the  ridge at the sky on the other side of the river. This is what I saw: A pale yellow oval object moving at a relatively slow speed heading East towards my friends home. At first I thought it was an unusual aircraft( strange shape and size...larger than a helicopter, smaller than airplane).  There were some clouds in the sky and there was moonlight. Then SUDDENLY the object changed direction almost 90 degrees south)- and also moved high rate of speed... instantly , zooming out of sight!. My thoughts were that it could not possibly be any aircraft I have ever seen in my 53 years . I saw something that stayed with me for a long time in my mind...could not get over the idea that seeing is believing. To make matters more interesting MY FRIEND IS A BOOK PUBLISHER AND ONE OF HIS AUTHORS OF ((title deleted)) PREDICTED WE WOULD HAVE ALIENS VISIT THE AREA THAT EVENING!!!!!! I went to the party to have a good time and didn't give this prognostication a second thought. I BELIEVE I HAVE EXPERIENCED MY FIRST U.F.O SIGHTING!;40.4417;-74.9537
