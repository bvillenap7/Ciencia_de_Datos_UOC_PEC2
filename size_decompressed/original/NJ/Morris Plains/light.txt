Red lights previously spotted in Morris Plains, NJ return to the sky in greater numbers;2009-02-17 20:50:00;10 minutes;Red lights previously spotted in Morris Plains, NJ return to the sky in greater numbers Was at the store and walked outside to at least 10 people on their cell phones looking up at the sky.  There were 9 red lights, shaped in what could have looked like the big dipper.  They were not moving as if they were planes flying.  They were more so bobbing in the sky.  The lights were also flashing.  At the time I saw them, one appeared to be drifting away from the pack, and slowly disappeared into the night.  The others gradually followed suit, but not all at once. I had no idea this had already happened in January until I returned home and searched for more information online. A relative called the police and was told it was a hoax !   The police dept. also reported to have received many calls regarding the lights.;40.846;-74.4874
