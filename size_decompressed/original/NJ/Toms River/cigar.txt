Cigar shaped haze with two rectangular windows.;2010-09-12 21:00:00;3 sec;Cigar shaped haze with two rectangular windows. I live about 10 miles west of the shore. and almost every night i go out behind my house to look at the stars.  some times seeing falling stars or even a falling satellight. the night of sept 12-13 about 9pm   i saw a falling star, and waited hoping to see an other. then some thing caught my eye as looked out to the east, expecting an other falling star, there was an dull orange hazy cigar shape with two rectangular sort of windows, that kind of glowed brighter orange then the haze. it moved forward then it was gone!...just like that gone! like some one turned off a light switch. it took a bit for me to realize what just happed. I stayed out a bit longer hoping to see it again, however i did not see any thing else that night. I told my kids about it and they just looked at me not sure if i was joking or not. Ive been wondering if any one has seen some thing like this before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.9830357446807;-74.1961438297871
