Sphere hovered over neighbors house possible entity sighting.;1970-08-24 23:50:00;Ten Minutes;Sphere hovered over neighbors house possible entity sighting. It was during the summer of 1970. The place was Toms River, New Jersey.  We lived on Fawn Drive. The object appeared around midnight. The light woke me up from my sleep. The object looked like the full moon and it hovered over the house of the neighbor across the street. The actual moon was to the south of the object. I was looking east toward the Atlantic Ocean.  After observing the object for what seemed like 10 minutes I returned to bed, very fearful. After a short while I felt paralyzed and could not even yell for my parents. Shortly after that I saw what looked like a humanoid figure dressed in some sort of space suit wearing a helmet. I felt lulled into a sleep.  The next thing that woke me up was the sound of what was at least two fighter jets. We lived close to Lakehurst NAS McGuire AFB was a little farther away but then again nothing is far away in New Jersey. After the jets passed over my sense of fear went away and I fell back asleep.  Interestingly enough, a neighbor two housed down the street, who had mocked us for my sighting was, in his words, buzzed by some UFO's on my way to work the other morning.

Illuminated globes cross the sky;2007-08-29 22:27:00;2 minutes;Illuminated globes cross the sky Letter to file    On Wednesday 29-August 2007 at 2227 (10:27 PM), my wife and I observed a group of six lighted objects traveling across the sky.  From our location in Toms River, NJ, the objects passed just to our West while traveling from the Southwest towards the Northeast. There were four peach/orange colored object and two smaller white objects. They held a general formation but the distance between the objects varied as they moved along.  There was no sound coming from the objects at all. We live under a busy airspace serving the New York metropolitan airports as well as the McGuire Air Force Base and can always hear the sound of a passing aircraft.  Altitude was hard to verify since the size of the objects was unknown. If they were the size of a small aircraft like the Cessna 175 (Which I flown in many times) then I would estimate their altitude at 5,000 feet and their ground speed to be 200 MPH. Altitude and speed remained constant while I observed them.  Both of us agreed that their shape was circular. My wife commented later was that she thought of jellyfish as she watched them. They looked to me as thought they were self illuminated globes.  I have never seen or reported anything like this before and have no opinion as to what they were. More than anything, I wanted to know if anyone else saw the same thing.;39.9830357446807;-74.1961438297871
Bright red spherical object with a rectangular center appearing like fire.;2014-07-25 22:30:00;90 seconds;Bright red spherical object with a rectangular center appearing like fire My property is located in the middle of a cul-de-sac which backs up to a large wooded area.  My wife and I were sitting outside when a light drew my attention to the northeast, facing two trees on my property and the beginning of our neighbor's backyard.  First instinctual thought was that a plane was about to pass, but we had not, as of yet, heard any indactive sounds.  As the light began to clear the obstruction of the trees, details became visible and our full attention was drawn to the object, which continued on in a southwestern direction without making any sound. The object was a red spherical object filled with a central rectangular section of what appeared to be orange fire.  The object was either relatively large or relatively low in altitude, and was bright enough to have drawn our attention before actually becomming visible.  The object roughly appeared to be the size of a full moon in the sky.  We continued observing it with an unobstructed view as it passed almost directly over our property before beginning to take a turn more distinctly toward the west-northwest which began to put it over the large wooded area our property borders.  The object was not fast moving but eventually disappeared beyond the treeline. I've been watching the sky my entire life I've always been intrigued by the night sky and all the various wonders that appear once the sun sets.  I've been using telescopes since I was a child, and I've never seen anything in the sky that I couldn't identify.   The possibility of this object being a chinese lantern briefly entered my mind and was dismissed in as short a timespan as the next blink of my eyes.  The object commanded your attention in a way that would have been unlikely for a Chinese lantern.;39.9830357446807;-74.1961438297871
