It moved across the sky past the little dipper and gradually went from a large bright light to the size of a pin and continued on its path. it did not look like a shooting star or a meteor. the moon was to my left facing north west of where i was standing and the object started on teh north east side of where i was standing. the object moved in the direction of the moon.;39.9830357446807;-74.1961438297871
Bright light coming down at 45 degree angle northeast of Toms River NJ 10/14 @ 9:45 PM;2012-10-14 21:45:00;10 seconds;Bright light coming down at 45 degree angle northeast of Toms River NJ 10/14 @ 9:45 PM Driving home at 9:45 PM, a VERY bright white circular object caught my eye. It was headed downward toward ground at a 45 degree angle from the sky.It disappeared behind the trees, and I was unable to find it again. This would mean it had to either land or go into a body of water. It appeared controlled, and too slow to be falling or crashing. I was so excited that I called my husband, who was visiting his mother, in Whiting, NJ, about 25 miles west from where I was. Before I could say anything, he exclaimed he thought he just saw a UFO, and described exactly what I saw.He agreed that it was too slow to be a falling star or meteor.  We have a lot of military planes flying over our home because we are near the Lakehurst military base.  This object didn't resemble any of the planes we are used to seeing. It also was in the northeastern sky from where I was in Toms River, where as Lakehurst would have been west.;39.9830357446807;-74.1961438297871
Green UFO;2012-11-15 00:00:00;5 seconds;Green UFO It was maybe a year ago when it happened. I was sitting there fishing around dark.  As I was about to get ready to leave I looked up in the sky.  I was amazed as I saw an almost bright green circle rather large in the sky.  It appeared out of thing air and had a high speed and then disappeared.  I strongly believe this was a UFO.  You can say what you want but I know what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
