silent floating lights with no sound;2009-11-04 17:45:00;1-2 min;silent floating lights with no sound On the evening of Nov 4 2009 my grandaugther and I were waiting in a parking lot for my wife to get off work and I noticed two bright lights hovering over the NJ parkway (approx 1.5 miles away) and it was just stationary after about 45 seconds  it started to move towards us and was flying low, when it reached us it was just west of the hospital I was at so I got out of my car and I didn't hear any sound coming from it, I thought it was a helicopter at first because of the way it was moving...low and slow and then it turned slowly to the west and moved away slow until it was out of sight. This thing had too many lights on it to be regular running lights for a plane or helicopter;39.9830357446807;-74.1961438297871
