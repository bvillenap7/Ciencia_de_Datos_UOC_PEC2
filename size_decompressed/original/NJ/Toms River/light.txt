UFO dancing in the Toms River NJ sky takes off at unbelievable speed.;2013-03-22 21:35:00;20 seconds;UFO dancing in the Toms River NJ sky takes off at unbelievable speed. Driving south on Garden State Parkway at around 9:35 pm.  There were about three to four cars in my view infront of me.  I saw a slow light moving east to west that was an obvious plane to my 1 o'clock position.  Out of the corner of my eye an orangey light was dancing to my 11 o'clock position over.  It looked like a kid playing with a sparkler.  I couldn't have been the only one who saw it because three of the cars infront of me applied the brakes on the open road.  It was abrupt, but then I looked back up and the orange light fired off heading south at an incredible speed and turned more red, and went out of sight.  It took probably 3 seconds to watch it go out of sight.;39.9830357446807;-74.1961438297871

When I looked to the ne direction I called attention to a bright orange light that appeared to be moving from s to n in a somewhat wobbly formation up and down.   After about 10 seconds the light grew brighter, appearing as though the light nearly doubled in size.   After a few more moments it dimmed down for a few seconds then began to glow bright again.   After dimming down a second time the object slowly descended straight down;39.9830357446807;-74.1961438297871
Glowing star moving vertically at a fast rate after hanging in the sky for several minutes.;2013-09-20 19:30:00;15:00;Glowing star moving vertically at a fast rate after hanging in the sky for several minutes. I was on the phone and watching the sun set from a 2nd floor window that faces due west. My house is at the end of a cul-de-sac looking straight up the street with an unencumbered view of the sky.  I could clearly see Venus and several bright stars including one that was lower in the sky than Venus and to the north, but just as bright.   I watched this star or planet or whatever it was just hanging in the sky for at least 10 minutes when it started moving vertically.  It moved fast and steady on a seemingly straight trajectory until it quickly disappeared.  From the time it began moving until it went out of view was maybe 15 seconds.  There were absolutely no clouds so it couldn't have gone behind cover.  In fact, I watched several planes at high altitudes moving through the sky for several minutes after, hoping I would see it again.;39.9830357446807;-74.1961438297871
