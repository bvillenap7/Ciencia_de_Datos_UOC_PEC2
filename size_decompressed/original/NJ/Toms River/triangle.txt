My wife and I were traveling on Hooper Avenue going home when at a stoplight I looked up and saw this 3 dimensional triangular shape traveling left and right quite rapidly and very low. It was also spinning in an erattic fashion with no specific pattern. It was triangular and there was a light on each end of the triangular shape, one could say pyramid like in a 3 Dimensional sense, as the lights spun with the shape. They were yellow and red and green in color, and it sped across the sky in no way a conventional craft, helicopter or anything else could fly. It spooked my wife who is a confirmed skeptic, until the other day when she couldnt believe it. It then spun below the tree line and disappeared. I stopped and looked but there was nothing to be seen. Lights and electronics seemed unaffected. Thats it.;39.9830357446807;-74.1961438297871
Triangle craft seen over Toms River, N.J.;2013-11-13 20:00:00;00:03;Triangle craft seen over Toms River, N.J. Location: RTE. 37 West Toms River, N.J. Time: 20:00 Approx. Weather: Clear  Distance from Object: 1/4 mile  Object Path: East to West then turned North  Speed: between 15 and 25 mph  Object Description:  Triangular with white running lights, and red and blue flashing lights. Length approximately 250ft. along each side.  Object made no audible sound. Observation: Object approached from the east crossing over the Garden State PWKY.  The object then stopped and hovered for approximately 30 seconds before turning north.  What caught my attention was its size and very slow speed at which it traveled. Opinion: I believe it to be a new aircraft being tested by our military.  I draw this conclusion by the use of FAA regulation lighting and its close proximity to Lakehurst Naval Base and McGuire AFB.  I also witnessed the same object a few nights later hovering over the area between Oyster Creek Nuclear Power Plant and the Garden State PKWY. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.9830357446807;-74.1961438297871
Large glowing rounded edge triangle vanished in a split second over water.;2017-10-21 21:01:00;95 seconds;Large glowing rounded edge triangle vanished in a split second over water. A flame orange colored large triangle with rounded edges.  It was moving way faster than a plane and was also much larger.  It flew over the land for a little over a minute, we followed it around the back of the house (we live on the water) and as it got over the middle of Barnegat Bay, it stopped for a few seconds and then completely vanished.   We tried to capture it on cell phone video, but it didn't show up even though we could still see it with our eyes.;39.9830357446807;-74.1961438297871
