Bright white object flying over Toms River;2010-10-22 20:45:00;10;Bright white object flying over Toms River Was on deck, when I saw a bright light high in the sky heading towards me.  Called my son, who lives next door to come out.  He got outside, it had turned east towards the Atlantic ocean and was gone.  A few minutes later, it was back or there was another one coming on the same path as the first one, only this one came straight.      As it passed, I saw red lights on the side of it.  My son was in the street watching it. He also saw red lights and heard a slight noise as it passed him.  The light was bright white and appeared to be glassy.  It was a pretty full moon and Venus was to the right of the moon. This object was flying towards Venus but much lower in the sky.;39.9830357446807;-74.1961438297871
