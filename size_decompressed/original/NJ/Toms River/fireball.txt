Two brilliant orange colored objects engulfed in a flame-like orange glow.;2010-07-04 21:00:00;3 MINS.;Two brilliant orange colored objects engulfed in a flame-like orange glow. Two brilliant-orange glowing objects passed overhead from south-west to north-east. Waiting for the fireworks to start when the two objects were spotted approaching from the south-west skies.  Grabbed my binoculars and had a clear view of them as they passed overhead.  Almost looked as though they were engulfed in intense orange flames, more brilliant in color than any orange you can imagine.  Totally silent, no strobe lights, no white lights, just two huge objects engulfed in a glowing brilliant orange flame-like color.  Afterwards huge military aircraft were seen flying thru the skies as though patrolling the area but the objects were long gone by then.;39.9830357446807;-74.1961438297871

Very low fireball, leaving a sparking trail, that was short-lived.. only a few seconds.  Traveling sideways toward the ground..;2014-10-03 19:53:00;3 seconds;Very low fireball, leaving a sparking trail, that was short-lived.. only a few seconds.  Traveling sideways toward the ground.. Upon exiting the (big/super)Shop-Rite on the intersection of Rt.37 and Rt. 166 in Toms River, I was getting into my vehicle and my eyes were drawn upward. There was a bright fireball traveling sideways, with a slight downward trajectory, that was not high enough to be a shooting star, but lower than an airplane, lets say. My first thought was it might me a firework of some sort, but this was way too high and bright.. and the trajectory was totally sideways.  It burned very bright as if on fire, and left sparks/ remnants in the air.  It was just East/ SouthEast of the Shoprite. I feel it was a metorite honestly, but I've never seen one so low before.  I would say it was around 1000 feet in the air.  It streaked like a shooting star.. but much lower and I could see details much more clearly.;39.9830357446807;-74.1961438297871
