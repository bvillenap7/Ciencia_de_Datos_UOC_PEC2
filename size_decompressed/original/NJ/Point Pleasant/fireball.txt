Orange-Red Fireball Across the Sky;2012-09-01 20:30:00;2 minutes;Orange-Red Fireball Across the Sky We were sitting outside around 8:30 PM when we saw an orange-red fireball moving southeast to northeast above our house.  While it was directly above our house it was bigger and seemed to have spikes or points coming out of it.  The object had no trail.  It made no sound. It did not blink like an airplane.  As it moved further away its size diminished until it appeared to burn out.;40.0844;-74.067
