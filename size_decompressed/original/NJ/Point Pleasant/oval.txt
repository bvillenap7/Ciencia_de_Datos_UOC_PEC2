This object was oval in shape and appeared about the size of a medium airplane.  It was in the south-west, and proceeded north east, over the ocean.  It was red, almost like an infrared light.  It moved very slowly.  This was viewed by over a hundred eye witnesses on Point Pleasant Beach.  Attempts at photographing this anomaly were fruitless,  Several people around my family and myself attempted to photograph this object, while waiting for the fireworks, and could not capture it on cameras, i pods, i phones, etc....  The background we observed was that over the Atlantic Ocean, via Point Pleasant Beach.  When we checked our gadgets to see if they were functioning properly, they photographed very well.  The only object we could not photograph was the infrared oval floating at a very slow speed, approximately 10-15 miles per hour.  The object moved further out over the ocean, then disappeared.  It remained in our view for approximately five to ten minutes.  This o! bject surely had an effect on our electrical devises, as they would not work when pointed at this object.;40.0844;-74.067
