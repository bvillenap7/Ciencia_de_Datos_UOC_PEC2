Fast moving object late night/early morning over the Jersey Shore.;2001-04-28 04:50:00;2 minutes;Fast moving object late night/early morning over the Jersey Shore. This morning I saw an object as I looked at the Big Dipper on my back porch. It was moving at a very high rate of speed with only one light to be seen from the ground and one other light underneath which pulsed intermittantly. I have watched the skies for many years because I am an aircraft enthusiast, but I have no doubt that this was no man-made aircraft simply due to the high rate of speed that it traveled at. It didn't zig-zag or anything, but it cleared the length of the sky in under 2 minutes. I would estimate it's altitude at 10,000 feet. This object made no sound which also leads me to believe that it was not a man-made craft.;40.0844;-74.067
