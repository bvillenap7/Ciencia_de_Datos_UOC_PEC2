Hovering band of light;2019-10-01 02:30:00;5 seconds;Hovering band of light I was at truck stop just off I-80 in New Jersey. I woke up around 2:30 ish in the morning and went to use the bathroom in the truck stop.  As I work for my truck to the bathrooms I noticed a band of light in the sky appearing to hover. I could fully see the band.  If appear to hover for about 2 seconds and then move off in what exact direction I don't know at an incredible speed.;40.942;-75.0521
