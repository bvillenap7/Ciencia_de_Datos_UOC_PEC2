Walking to house nextdoor, noticed large object moving slowly.  Caught my eye because was moving like a helicopter but made absoutly no sound whatsoever.  Also had some lights on it but no avaition blinkers red/green.   Traveled slowly south for a short time then quickly changed direction to the east and shot over the mountain range.  The acceleration was unbelievable was gone out of light in less than a second.   I do not remember the shape or exactly what it looked like as it did not resemble any airrcraft known to myself.  Besides some other colored lights it possibly had what looked to be a large spotlight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));41.115;-74.5875
