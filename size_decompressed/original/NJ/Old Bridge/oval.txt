5 orange oval shape objects in the sky.;2013-07-06 21:30:00;few minutes;5 orange oval shape objects in the sky Sitting out on the deck, while my dog was out in the yard.   I happen to look up and saw 5 orange oval shape objects, going across the sky, each was following the one in front of it.  I open the door and ask my husband to come outside.   He later confirmed, seeing the same thing that I saw. None of the objects made any kind of sound or had any blinking lights. We are not sure, if they just vanished or just went in a cloud.  Whole thing, only lasted a few minutes.;40.3913000000001;-74.3247000000001
