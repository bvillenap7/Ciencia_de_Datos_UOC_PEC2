It had some sort of thin light all around it, kind light blue/whiteish, a very matt light, and inside was very dark and black and matt as well.  no relection at all no matter how much i tried to look at the black area, it almost like a black void.  it was dusky out, no sound, and very slow moving.  It eventually moved out of sigh and went over rt 9.   I felt almost paralyzed in fear and went inside to hide.   To this day I tell the story.  No way this was of this world.  I had never believed in aliens before, brought up very strict christian.  This was life changing.;40.3913000000001;-74.3247000000001
silent, slow moving disc, with bluish green glow seen in old bridge NJ on june 17th 1994.;1994-06-17 21:50:00;5 Min;silent, slow moving disc, with bluish green glow seen in old bridge NJ on june 17th 1994. around 9:50pm on june 17th 1994, the same night that OJ simpson was running from the police..my older brother was outside in our back yard, making himself grilled chicken on the grill while myself and a friend where inside playing around with a guitar. suddenly, my brother comes crashing through the back door, pale white, yelling come out side, come outside!! theres a ufo!, and he runs back outside. so i throw down my guitar, my friend and i run to the back door, and to our amazment, theres a low flying, slow moving, flying saucer cruising through the summer sky! it was a disc with a bluish glow around it, barely moving through the sky and making absolutly no noise. it was flying over the power lines that ran behind my backyard not even a quarter of a mile high. it didn't take off at a million miles and hour or anything like that...it just eventually moved out of our site after like 5 minutes. we jumped into a car and followed the power lines looking for it, but by then it was nowhere to be found. i am convinced that this was nothing else other than a UFO and not of this world....it was just moving too slow to not be making any noise...and we were close enough that we would have heard something...not to mention that it was a flying saucer! every now and then on shows like sightings and whatever else...i will see pictures of the exact same thing. a neighbor of ours told us a few days later that a friend of hers who is a police officer in the town we are from said that there were over 300 phone calls that night reporting a UFO and that all the reports came in line with the high tension power lines that run through old bridge. i have been searching ufo web pages in hopes of finding something about this event but i have never seen anything...hopefully my report will be followed by others.;40.3913000000001;-74.3247000000001
