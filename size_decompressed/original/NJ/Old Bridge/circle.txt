Black circular, ball like object hovering in the sky over Old Bridge New Jersey,6-17-17 Appr.5:10 PM;2017-06-17 17:10:00;1 minute;Black circular,ball like object hovering in the sky over Old Bridge New Jersey,6-17-17 Appr.5:10 PM I was walking toward my house in the front,I saw over, but beyond my home a black object hovering in the sky beyond my home,  it was very obvious against the blue sky with scattered white clouds.  I stopped walking and stared at it for about a minute, it wasn't moving.   I than ran in the front door, grabbing my camera on the counter top,and out the back door,but it was gone.  It took no more than 10 seconds to run through the house,  I am still scanning the sky for it,  camera in hand now.  I hope someone in the area photographed it.;40.3913000000001;-74.3247000000001
