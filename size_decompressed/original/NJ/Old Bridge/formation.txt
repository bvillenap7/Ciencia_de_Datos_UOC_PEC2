I lifted my neck to stretch and there was an object above me.;2018-10-12 12:00:00;<5 minutes;I took my usual walk on the usual route.  I walked across the street and lifted my neck to stretch and there was an object above me.  The best way to describe it.  A jellyfish.  It was moving quickly.  It was a windy day today and I thought maybe it was debris flying through the air but it was not.  It was clear with a dark color mid-section, which is why I describe it jellyfish like.  It was flying in the air and flew to the woods that border the area I walk along and I swear it looked like it made itself smaller and disappeared.  Was white in color but translucent with dark mid section.  I honestly do not know what it was.   Only saw a couple of birds on my walk and no leaves high in the air.  The leaves were bristling on the ground because it was windy.  Very clear pretty crisp day today and it was windy.  I really do not know what I saw.   My vision is excellent except I wear reading glasses.  I'm in my 40's.;40.3913000000001;-74.3247000000001
