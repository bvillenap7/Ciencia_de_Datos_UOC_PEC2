Spherical green light hovering in New Jersey;2020-12-15 05:30:00;30 seconds;Spherical green light hovering in New Jersey I was driving when I stopped at an intersection and noticed a green circular light hovering about 20-30 feet away from my vehicle. It was flying very low in the sky. It was small, spherical, bright green, and glowing while moving very slowly and with intention.   After about 10-15 seconds it flew off above the trees into the distance. It flew extremely fast and moved in a rhythmic side to side motion.  The object appeared quite small.  What I saw really freaked me out and I’ve been trying to put it out of my mind but I just can’t.;40.8701;-74.6566
