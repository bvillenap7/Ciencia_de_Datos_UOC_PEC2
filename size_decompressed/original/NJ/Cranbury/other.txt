My three year old son pointed to a military craft flying and leaving a vapor trail. I turned around and indeed saw the plane, but something else cought my attention. Flying in fron of this plane was something else. It was barely noticeble but it was there. It left no visible trail or disturbance. It was traveling at a nuch higher altitude (I assume) and at a much greater speed. I saw it outdistancing the military jet. Both were flying in an easterly direction. After we competed our shopping, we left the store and proceeded south on Rt 130 to the local Wendes. Halfway there my 11 year old daughter and I saw two football shaped objects, flying at a high rate of speed in an easterly direction. There were no markings, engines, lights and windows on both objects. They were flying in very close to each other. It appeared that it was less than the actual lenght of the craft. This event lasted about 30 seconds.;40.3015;-74.5027
