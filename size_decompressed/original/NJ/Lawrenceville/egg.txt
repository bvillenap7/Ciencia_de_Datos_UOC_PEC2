It traveled faster than anything I've ever seen before.   It was very bright and white, it also left a thin white tail behind it.   As fast as it moved, that's how fast it disappeared.   The sky was clear, the stars were out and there were two planes in sight.  They seemed to be standing still compared to how fast this object moved.  I've never seen a shooting or falling star, or even a meteor, so I don't know if that is what it was.;40.2928;-74.7256
