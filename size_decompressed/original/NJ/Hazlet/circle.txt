Made no sound and had the ability to rapidly alter course during forward movement.  Seemed like a meteor, but did not change in intensity or have a flared tail.  In my sight for 10-15 seconds as it flew through the entire night sky.  visible even with great amounts of light pollution. ((NUFORC Note:  The Director of NUFORC witnessed something very similar to what is reported here.  My sighting occurred over Seattle in August 1992, and although a short-lived phenomenon, it was, nevertheless, quite dramatic.  PD));40.4193;-74.179
