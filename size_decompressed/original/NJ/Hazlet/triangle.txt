Its V shape against the blue sky was clear. I was sitting in my back yard enjoying the warmth of the afternoon sun when my pet dog sat on my lap and looked up into the sky.   I looked in the direction she was staring and saw the cloud cover to be very sparse and light and moving slowly when an V shaped object which appeared to be at a very high altitude maybe 40-50 thousand feet and moving  west to east at a speed 3â€“4 times faster than any jet I have ever seen.    The color of the object was pale but the V shape was clear as it moved across the sky.   The entire incident lasted only 3- 4 seconds before it left my view angle over my roof.  I got up to try to observe it further but it had already vanished from the sky.   I went inside my home to tell my wife what I had just witnessed.
