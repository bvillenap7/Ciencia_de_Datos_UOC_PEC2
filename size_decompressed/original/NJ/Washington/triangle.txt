LIKELY NOT OF THIS EARTH was out walkin dog. looking north and west in the sky I saw a large craft with triangle shape lights on tips. smaller craft were hovering south of me.  movement was not that of air craft we know. not man made in its motion.  I COULD SEE FROM THE SIZE OF THE TRIANGULAR SHAPED CRAFT IT WAS HUGE.  MORE THAN SEVERAL FOOTBALL FIELDS IN LENGTH.  AS THIS CRAFT HOVERED CLOSER OVER HEAD THEN MOVED WESTWARD.  THEN NORTH.  THE OTHER SMALLER CRAFT WERE TOGETHER IN TWOS AND HOVERED IN THE SOUTH SKY BEFORE MOVING OUT INTO DEEP SPACE.;40.7575;-74.9967
