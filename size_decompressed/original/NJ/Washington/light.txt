A ball of light similar to the headlight of an airplane came cruising across the clear night sky.  As I joked to my companions that it was a UFO due to no flashing lights the craft began to raipdly climb higher into the atmoshphere.   Within seconds the bright light had disapeared.   What I thought I saw at first was an airplane until it made the unuasual climb and disapeared into the cloudless night sky.;40.7575;-74.9967
