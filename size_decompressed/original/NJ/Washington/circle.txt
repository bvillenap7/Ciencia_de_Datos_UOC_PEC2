I was driving South on Rt. 31 out of Washington, Warren County, NJ when an extremely shinny object in the sky caught my eye. It was far away and traveling West to East rather quickly. It looked to be just slightly smaller than a dime at the distance it was. At first I thought it must be a plane but as I focused on it a few things struck me as odd. 1) it was moving quite fast 2) it was INTENSELY SHINNY 3) it looked flat and round.  After only a few seconds it just disappeared. It was not as if it shot upward or down or anything like that it just was gone. I kept watching the sky to see if maybe it had turned or something but there was nothing and then about 3-5 seconds after it disappeared a huge black helicopter came into view from the West slightly closer and continued to the East.  The whole thing took place in a matter of 10 seconds or so about 11:55 AM Monday, August 18, 2008  In my line of work I am always on the road at various times of day and night. I have always been one to watch the sky. I have seen many shooting stars, a satellite and glowing greenish meteor during a fall meteor shower. What I saw today was quite strange. It reminded me of a round mirror in the sky.;40.7575;-74.9967
