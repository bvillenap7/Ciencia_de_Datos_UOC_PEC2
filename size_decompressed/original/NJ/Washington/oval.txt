Driving home after going to dinner, a few friends and i were driving down an back road, coming downward from a hill i looked up to see a green oval shaped object flash across the sky. It was VERY VERY bright but it was above the cloud line. it was only there for a moment but I know what I saw. I instantly slowed down and kept looking up, i turned down the music and asked it anyone else saw what i just saw (after screaming a few profanities) and my girlfriend who was in the passenger seat said Oh my God, I saw it too. You mean that green thing right? I replied yes, and we kept peering but the light was long gone. Also to include detail it was obviously dark out, and it was a chilly night. No one was using any drugs nor alcohol.;40.7575;-74.9967
