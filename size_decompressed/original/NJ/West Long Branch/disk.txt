thin disk, jagged edges, orange lights;2002-07-30 20:00:00;less than 5 min.;thin disk, jagged edges, orange lights A friend of mine and I were on my back deck around 8:00pm and I looked up at the sky and this thing caught my eye. It was round but had rough or cut out edges (I don't know how to discribe this without drawing a picture). It looked kind of dark grey. I told my friend to look and at first he looked quickley and said it was a balloon and looked away. I kept looking at it and it turned side-ways and it was like thin or flatish. I told him it couldn't be because of that and to hurry up and look again! The longer we looked at it the more we were saying, what the heck is that!!! It was flying in a strange manner turning and twisting so we could see all aspects of it. Right before we lost sight of it, it turned in a way that we could see it had reddish-orange lights on it. It didn't make any noise. I keep thinking there must be an explanation for it but I don't know what it could be. It wasn't as high as a regular airplane would be, but it wasn't low enough to be some kind of remote control toy. I didn't report it right away because I tried to just dismiss it, but the more I think about what I saw, the more I know I saw something significant.;40.289;-74.0099
