It was grey in color and moved along on a horizontal path. It was very distinct in its shape.  I could make out a couple of lines in the body going from top to bottom.  I pulled off the road into a mall parking lot and quickly got out of my car so that I can see it more clearly and tried to take a couple of snapshots with my blackberry phone which I sort of knew would not capture it.  I was a light grey and blended with the sky.  I watched it for about 6 or 8 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.289;-74.0099
