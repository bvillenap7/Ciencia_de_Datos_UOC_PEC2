Look, I have NEVER seen a ufo and do not believe in them and have been known to make fun of those who do. This thing just changed as I looked at it. the star seemed to be getting closer and then took off and vanished Did anyone else see this thing. No Noise, no trailing lights nothing but this bright star that vanished. I don't want to be contacted.I think you're all are a bunch of nuts. Or at least I thought so. I will keep an eye on the website in the hope that someone else saw this thing or can explain to me what it was.;40.8886116883117;-74.0496064935066
