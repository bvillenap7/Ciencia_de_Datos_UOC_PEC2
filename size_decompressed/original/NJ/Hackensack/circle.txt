It's all real what i seen that night. I saw a ufo circular shaped although it was a bright white light only, moved very slow and had no sound to it at all. I was looking out my window and it moved over my head over my building. I stayed looking at it for about 3 minutes. Then i did some research over the internet and seen the same ufo in a couple of videos posted. The size of it was really big and the ufo was flying very close to the building. I live in a 6 story building, but like i said it made no noise and was very bright. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

((anonymous report));2011-06-30 00:00:00;3 minutes;The sky was clear black and all I saw was a circular white bright light with no glare or haze. Hello, world my experience with a UFO was at night I basically had asked God to show me a UFO.  And one night I was smoking a cigarette outside my window and I looked up to the sky and saw this bright circular white clear light. The size of the UFO was really big.  I looked around and no cars were around and no people walking.  I was inside my building and it flew over my building but at a very slow pace. It was almost like it was looking at me from the path it flew over me.  This is very real. I saw it for about 3 minutes and it was gone.  Made no sound and had no glare just a very bright white light. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.

5 bright white lights seen over North Jersey.;2013-08-24 21:15:00;5-8 minutes;5 bright white lights seen over North Jersey On Saturday, August 24th, 2013, my wife noticed something in the northern sky and called my attention to it.  There were a series of 5 lights in the sky in a formation that was a complete circle bot not quite round.  The lights stayed in formation and were bright and easily visable in a clear sky and then gradually faded away.   One light stayed longer than the others before it also faded away.   We are in a very high traffic area for planes with 5 major airports nearby.  These lights were not planes. No craft that I know of can hover at the height of these lights.  Also, each of the lights gradually faded away as if they were going farther and farther away until they could not be seen any more.;40.8886116883117;-74.0496064935066
