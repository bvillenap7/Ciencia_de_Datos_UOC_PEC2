I was driving along the main road in town when I saw to my right in the sky what looked like a far away plane with its headlights on.  It was moving very slowly in a straight-ahead direction, straight across the sky.  Then, all the sudden, it shot down at I’d say a 75-80% angle and the lights grew much more intense as it fell to the earth.  It looked like a bow tie shape where the inside had a straight, large black line and on both sides was a triangle of bright light.  The triangle was fuzzy on the sides and looked “jagged” on the outside edge, almost like sunrays.  It shot down past the top of the trees, and I could no longer see it.  It left behind a small smoke trail. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.7242;-75.2076

Just hovered still and then had a bluish and red light next to the bright light as it took off Bright light while driving home seemed to be just staying in the same spot.  As we approached our road to turn it was above the trees and next to us!  It wasn't very high and wasn't moving!  The round light was the brightest. brighter than a spotlight.  We stopped the car and just watched it for a few minutes surprised that it didn't fly away right away.  I was amazed and didn't think to take pictures but my son did just as it went to move above us and took off.  When it went to move it had a bluish light and a reddish light on the sides of the bright light.;39.7242;-75.2076
