Triangle over Ringwood and Haskell.;2016-12-05 18:15:00;6 minutes;Triangle over Ringwood and Haskell Driving on Ringwood avenue going south in Ringwood, when I first notice a one blue hue light in the sky (west of my position), at that moment it was still. It was about half to one degree below the moon and the moon was about ¼ above the horizon. (the moon being near)   At first I thought it was Mars or Venus, but I quickly realized that it wasn’t nether planet because it started moving very moving slowly.  As I continue south towards Haskell one blue bright light became 3 lights in the shape of a triangle.  At first the craft stated moving south, all lights we’re a solid hue of blue.  As I moved along the lights suddenly started to move from south southwest to south southeast.  Like crossing the street.   Moments later it does the same maneuver but opposite (all within 5-7 minutes)  There was unusually hi air traffic but you could tell which path the airplane we’re taking, plus this object didn’t have any blinking lights or lights of any other color, just 3 blue lig! hts moving slowly in the sky.  As I get closer to I-287 the craft moves again in a circle as I get closer to Federal Hill the craft stats heading north towards New York State.  And that’s when I lost visual contact of the craft.
