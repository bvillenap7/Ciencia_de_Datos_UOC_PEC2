Rectangular craft with white, red, and green lights.;2018-07-04 22:30:00;2 minutes;Rectangular craft with white, red, and green lights. My father had been in the back yard when he saw a rectangular figure with round lights. They were red, green, and white.  I came outside when I heard him say, Something's going on out here!  We watched it rise to an altitude lower than an airplane.  Hard to say how big it was.  In approximately one minute it maneuvered very quickly to the southwest, without making a 180 degree turn.  Just seemed to go in reverse.  Then it disappeared below the horizon.;40.3909;-74.1153
