Sphere, black in color, silent,no lights headed north;2008-06-01 14:00:00;2 Minutes;Sphere, black in color, silent, no lights headed north On my roof top hammock I witnessed a dark black object heading due north at a speed no aircraft could match.  I timed it at two minutes before it disapeared.  No lights  No sound.  I would say the altitude was inbetween 15,000 and 20,000 feet because the cloud levels were above that and it was below the layers of clouds.  Wind was 25 to 35 gusting west. It couldn't have been a ballon because it didn't track with the wind.;40.3909;-74.1153
