3-second fireball flies over me.;1998-01-11 06:55:00;5 seconds;3sec fireball flies over me. While driving North on GSP at Approximately mile marker 123-4 looking in my rearview mirror, I noitice a light that suddenly was growing larger very rapidly.   Next thing I realized it passed over me at about 600 feet.  It looked like a fireball skating across at the same height following the contour of the ground.  I noticed that because of the angle and location.  (I could see the curve of the horizon in my mirror)  From the time I spotted it to the time it was gone had to be 3 seconds at the most..;40.3909;-74.1153
