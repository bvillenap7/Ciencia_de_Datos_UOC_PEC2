Seeing is believing but it scary as hell;2007-05-08 00:00:00;2 minuets;Seeing is believing but it scary as hell It was midnight, as I was on my smoke brake from work, I notice the clouds were a weird pinkish color, as I stared into the clouds thier was a lightning strike in side the clouds I thought it was cool, but to my surprise it was the scariest thing Ive seen.. A cigar shape that was metalic in color shot across the sky, being the clouds were pinkish I got a dam good look at it. I was bugged out because I had the weirdest feeling that I was in trouble. dont know why maybe I wasnt supposed to see them. I ran back inside to grab a co-worker, as we  came back out it was gone. My buddy did like the view of the sky. we waited 15 minuets then gave up on the sky watching. Ever since that day I feel like Im being observed. weird.;40.3909;-74.1153
