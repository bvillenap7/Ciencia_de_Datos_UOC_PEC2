radically strobing lights form triangular shape followed by 15 lights in random alternating strobing patterns.;2002-04-10 22:05:00;5 minutes;radically strobing lights form triangular shape followed by 15 lights in random alternating strobing patterns. Three radically strobing lights forming corner of a triangle moving east to west and then south to north.  Then immediately appearing overhead for a few seconds and then many (maybe 10 to 15) radically strobing/twinkling and moving, zigzagging lights for another minute.  The shapes were circular. Sky was partly cloudy at night.  Lights were in front of any cloud cover and no noise present.  While this occurred there were a very high number of aircraft in the sky, as many as 10.  The aircraft didn't appear to be jets or helicopters.  After this event, air traffic slowed to the usual several per minute.  I took video of the event and will send it in at a later time.;40.3909;-74.1153
