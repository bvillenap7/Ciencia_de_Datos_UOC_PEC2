I saw a white dot approach from S.W. direction, straightening out and heading North for a bit.  Then swerving N.E. after a good northerly stretch.   What first caught my eyes and ears were the lack of blinking colored lighting of any kind and the absolute silence that came off off it.  Well,that combined with the speed and maneuverability of this thing.  Very impressive to say the least.  Where I live I am pretty immune to a lot of Dover AFB comings and goings.  I will add that this was very different.  Very different indeed.;39.0258;-74.8821
