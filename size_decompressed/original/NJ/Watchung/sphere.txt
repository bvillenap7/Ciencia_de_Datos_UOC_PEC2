Bizarre;2012-10-11 02:45:00;1 hour about;Orange sphere moving in unbeliveable ways,,,another green spehere near by with rays emerging form it. biazzare I woke up around 2:45 to use the rest room.  When I returned to my room, I looked out the window as I have always been interested  in astronomy.   I saw what looked like a planet, because it looked closer and more orange.  It start kind of bobbling up and down and I didn’t think  much of it, probably just optical illusion that happens with these things.  The next thing I know made yell at the top of my lungs waking my parents at 2:45 in the morning.  The object was  clearly moving in circles.  Then would stop and make extremely fast movements to the right or left.  This object continued to move in many directions and always came back the original area.  I then noticed, through a sparsely leaved  tree in our yard, another object colored green with rays emerging from all sides, kind of like the sun, but less blurred and more singular defined green rays. And this object was green as green gets.  This one did not move as much but did come closer and further. Probably bet! ween a mile away and  a mile and half away as a rough approximation.  I thought I might have seen a form of a craft but I can’t be sure.  I also thought i saw a light emerge from the green one, but again,not sure.  But I am absolutely certain what I saw was not a plane, a star or planet, not a light show,a prob, nothing I can think of.   I call it the most bizzare thing my life.  I sat on my knees watching out the window for the entire 1 hour 20 mins. Please let me know of any questions. I showed my mom for about a minute and agreed that she had no explanations for it.;40.6394;-74.4489
