3  objects moving unconvetionally and disappearing thereaffter.;2013-12-07 00:30:00;15;3  objects moving unconvetionally and disappearing thereaffter. I heard banging like chopping trees.  It was an odd time, so I went to my bedroom window. We have a minor view of the NYC skyline during winter when no leaves block view. I saw some of the city lights per usual.  The cityis probably 25-30 miles away. There was one green colored circular/oval shaped but the light its self was more apparent.I noticed it and though maybe its just a light from Plainfied or somewhere closer because this was no more than 5 miles away.  Next thing I notice is the object/light hovering and then slowly movinng straight upwords maybe 500-1000 ft and at that moment it did a bunch of zig zag,right angle, non-coonventional jet movements.  It then came to a stop and hovered for about 10 seconds. And simply disapperared. thought that was it when I looked leftward ou t the windo and now there are new organge/yellow objects.  There were two of them, identical looking. They didn’t move fast but far sideways while the other stood still. Then the one came back placed itself next to the still one which then move straight up and straight left, right angled. Then, both in a colum moved up and down until they became more near eachother and dissapeard. I hate hoaxes I sware this is what I saw I don’t even know how to play thricks, I don’t have a smartphone, camera, video recorderk etc.   I am really hopinn for some corrabaration and a call if posssible. These wer not stars, not nyc lights, nothing like that, way to close. I hope somone else saw, but I don’t care if no one believes me, family only wouldn’t tell others. I know what I saw and that is the most amazing thing I have ever seen no doubt.  Please give me a call or email Back. Thanks much.;40.6394;-74.4489

ACROSS HOVERING IN THE SKY  9/14/2014, 3:58 p.m.: 	 ON THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 10, 2014 4:37A.M. TO 4:44A.M. I SAW SOMETHING IN THE SKY THAT WAS NOT OF THIS WORLD!  I WAS ON MY WAY TO WORK IN NEW JERSEY ON RT. 78 EAST BY JCT. 287 NORTH & SOUTH IN WATCHUNG, NEW JERSEY. I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH MY WIFE THE WHOLE TIME SINCE I LEFT THE HOUSE AT 4:04A.M. AS I WS TRAVELING EAST ON RT. 78 COMING TO TO CROSS ROADS FOR 287. I SEE A HUGE BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY UP ABOVE. IN FRONT OF ME, IT LOOKS LIKE THE BIGGEST STAR I HAVE EVER SEEN. AS I GOT CLOSER TO IT I THOUGHT THE STATE POLICE WAS GOING TO LAND A MED A VAC CHOPPER ON THE HIGHWAY. AS I GOT CLOSER TO THE LIGHT, I SAW WHAT LOOKS TO BE ONE LIGHT TURN INTO TWO BIG LIGHTS, AND ONE LITTLE LIGHT. THE MOON WS FULL BUT THERE WAS A FEW CLOUDS IN THE SKY.  AS I GOT CLOSER I COULD SEE IT WAS SOME TYPE OF DISC  SHAPE TO IT, LIKE A STEALTH BOMBER.  LIKE A HUGE V-SHAPE IN THE SKY. WHEN I WAS RIGHT UNDER IT, I LOOKED UP, I SAW A PLANE THAT WAS FLYING WAY ABOVE IT AT A TREMENDOUS SPEED. AT THAT EXACT MOMENT AS I WAS UNDER THE OBJECT I HAD A VERY WARM FEELING THROUGHT MY BODY AND FELT LIKE I  URANINATED MYSELF.  TIME STOPPED.  I LOOKED AT MY SPEED ODOMETER IT WAS STUCK AT 52 MPH. THIS OBJECT WAS ABOUT 300FT WIDE ACROSS THE HIGHWAY AND ABOUT 500FT.HIGH OVER ME. I COULD SEE THE SHAPE OF IT, AT FIRST IT LOOKED LIKE A HUGE V SHAPE IN THE SKY, THEN AN OVAL DISC, AS I WAS  UNDER THE OBJECT THEN IT LOOKED LIKE A STINGRAY FISH WITH A TAIL. RIGHT AFTER I SAW THE OBJECT, I SAID TO MY WIFE LET ME OFF THE PHONE. I CALL THE STATE POLICE AND TOLD THEM WHAT I JUST WHITNESSED IN THE SKY IN THE SKY, THE STATE POLICE SAID IT WAS  NO MED A VAC UP AT THAT TIME IN THE STATE AND OTHER WHITNESS CALLED IN ABOUT THE OBJECT. I KNOW WHAT I SAW AND FEEL I WAS TRUELY BLESSED TO SEE THAT IN LIFE TIME.  I KNOW NOW WHAT OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THE  WORLD SAW IT THE SKY. THERE IS SOME THING OUT THERE IN SPACE, EXPERTS CANNOT EXPLAIN. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT OR WHO THEY ARE OR WHERE THEY CAME FROM.   I WILL SAY THIS, ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2014 WAS THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE TO HAVE SEEN AND  EXPERENCED THIS MY SELF. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite eloquent and serious-minded.   We suspect that he is a reliable witness.  PD));40.6394;-74.4489
