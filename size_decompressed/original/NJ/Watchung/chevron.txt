Chevron-shaped craft flying low and slow over Watchung, NJ.;2016-02-10 05:15:00;3 minutes;Chevron-shaped craft flying low and slow over Watchung, NJ. On Wednesday February 10th, at 5:15am, I was on my way to the gym before work.  I had just turned out of the driveway and outside my driver-side window I caught a glimpse of a large flying object.  It was literally just above the tree line!  I clearly saw the charcoal colored underside of the wide chevron-shaped wingspan against the night sky.  There were red lights at the tip of each wing and a white light at the front center.  It was too dark to discern the shape of the fuselage, however I assumed that it was a jet.  I was taken aback as to how low it was flying, and how unusually slowly it was traveling. It crossed overhead and was not easily seen on my heavily wooded street.  For a brief second I thought about taking a photo, but my phone was in my purse behind the seat.  I figured it would be too late and too dark by the time I got to it. I continued to drive 1 mile out of my neighborhood, and more than 2 minutes passed when I came to the clearing on Hillcrest Road at the exit 40 overpass for Route 78.  At that point I was very surprised to see it again!  It was straight ahead in the near distance, traveling slowly in a north-easterly direction just over the tree line toward Berkeley Heights. At the time I thought it was really odd, and since then continue to leave the house as the same exact time to hopefully see it again!  Now that 2 weeks have passed, I am realizing that I will likely never have the opportunity again.  Now I am sorry that I didnâ€™t pay closer attention when it happened!  I am wondering, did anyone else possibly see the same thing? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.6394;-74.4489
