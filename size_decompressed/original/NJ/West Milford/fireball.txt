Five orange orbs of fire/light dancing in sky in West Milford, NJ;2011-01-17 19:55:00;2 min;Five orange orbs of fire/light dancing in sky in West Milford, NJ January 17, 2011 At just before 8:00 this evening, five orange lights appeared in the sky by my home in West Milford, NJ above the lake. Three came first and then two more appeared. I counted them twice…there were five in total. I first thought it was a firework, then as it shot towards me, I thought it was a missile.  I was afraid at first, thinking terrorism, but then they stopped before me and seemed to dance around a bit. Three lights at first, joined by two more.   It was not like a big object, just these balls of orange, bright fire balls, not perfectly round.  There was low cloud cover that evening and as the lights went back up into the sky, we did hear an engine noise.  I screamed for my husband and daughter. They both witnessed the event as well as my neighbor and his wife. Another witness was driving down our road, stopped the car and asked what the h*** is that? I called 911, but by the time the police arrived the lights were gone. They were in the sky for what I would say was about two minutes. No rigid geometrical formation…just almost like a dance. I have to say it is the weirdest thing I ever saw, yet very beautiful at the same time and I almost feel blessed. The police took a report, I was NOT drinking. After trying to contact the FAA (please leave a message) and Homeland Security (sorry this doesn’t sound like a terroristic threat)…I felt at a loss. I’m not a loony, I have witnesses to what I saw. I just came across this site.  It's been over two weeks since the event and I can't let go of it.  Thanks for listening…I just wanted people to know.;41.0916;-74.3719
