It had 4 lights in the back- 1 blue, 2 yellow lights in the middle, and 1 red.   Then it flew up back high into the sky and met up with another one of the same aircraft. They met in the middle of 3 stars that formed a triangle,  Then came back down and flew low in the sky again.  When I got home I saw it again in the sky.  Then it flew away and I couldn't see it anymore.   Very big aircraft, larger than a plane.;41.0916;-74.3719
