Explosion of light in North Brunswick;2008-03-14 23:00:00;40 seconds;Explosion of light in North Brunswick As my husband and I were tucking in our son, he noticed a light in the sky about 300 yards away. We are close to an airport and have many aircraft that fly overhead so we thought nothing of it. All of a sudden it was getting brighter, at the same time the power went out in our area and this small light erupted in a bright flash of blue light, it looked as if night was transformed into day. The explosion of light went outward instead of upward. As soon as the bright flash happened the power came right back on. Almost as if something sucked up all the electricity for the explosion of light because the electricity came back on ASAP. That doesn't happen if it is being worked on.;40.4551;-74.4870999999999
