Pill shaped dot grows larger and shines, no vapor trail or sound;2012-09-25 17:40:00;5 minutes;Pill shaped dot grows larger and shines, no vapor trail or sound As I was walking through a parking lot watching the white vapor trails of air plains – I viewed from the south to the east, then looking upward into a clear blue sky- to the east, a small pill shaped dot appeared-it was traveling south to north-from my view right to left- it’s color was a pinkish bronze. I noticed that it was not making any sound, nor was it leaving any vapor trail. The aircraft that was making a vapor trail seemed miles away from the unidentified object, both were traveling in the same direction, at what appeared to be different altitudes. From my right to left in my view they could have been traveling at the same speed. It appeared about 30 seconds into my viewing of the airplane and it’s vapor trail. It was in my field of view for approximately 90 seconds then disappeared. Still watching the vapor trail of the airplane it reappeared however this time it was a larger dot, but not much larger, still the same pinkish bronze color. It began to shine white, I was uncertain if it was the sun reflecting off the object or if the object itself was shining.  It shined for about 1 minute then I could see its color pinkish bronze it got a little smaller then disappeared, for about 30 seconds. Then it reappeared and it was pinkish bronze only for 10 or 15 seconds then shined white then I took my cell phone camera and took one photo of the object, saved the photo-that took me 20 seconds to do that, so getting ready to take another photo, I noticed it was a smaller pinkish bronze dot again, then it was gone, but the airplane was still in view.;40.4551;-74.4870999999999
