Reddish-orange Triangle stopped, quietly hovered then turned sharply right.;2020-08-24 20:30:00;2 minutes;Reddish-orange Triangle stopped, quietly hovered then turned sharply right. I went out to dispose of recycling at around 8:30 p.m. Standing on my back porch facing west I observed a bright reddish-orange triangle moving toward my location from west to east.  My home lies on the approach path to Newark Intl. Airport. This object made no sound as it moved toward my home in the same manner and altitude (a few thousand feet) as most planes do. After a few seconds it stopped moving east, hovered for a couple seconds then sharply turned right (south).  It disappeared behind trees and I lost sight of it.;40.4551;-74.4870999999999
