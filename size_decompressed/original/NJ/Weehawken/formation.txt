bright orange craft/formation seen in New York vacinity.;2003-09-07 10:05:00;4 MINUTES;bright orange craft/formation seen in New York vacinity. The craft shape looked like a dumb bell - or 2 rotating spheres/teardrops. The craft(s) was bright red/orange and initially I thought it was a coast guard helicopter/blimp or weather balloon. The craft moved from the vicinity of newark toward staten island then towards jersey city - at one point it appeared to stop for about 30 seconds befored going back in the direction of staten island. It is difficult to estimate size and range - I have to assume the object was between  ~5 -> 15 mileas away and moved about 40 miles during the sighting. The object appeared to rotate about multiple axis during this sighting. The sighting ended when the object was obscurred by buildings. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not identify self.  We presume the reports describes a daytime sighting.  PD));40.7662;-74.0177999999999
