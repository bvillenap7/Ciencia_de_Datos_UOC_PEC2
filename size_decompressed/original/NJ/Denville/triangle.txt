Black Triangle In Deville NJ;2008-04-10 20:30:00;10 min.;Black Triangle In Deville NJ On Thursday April 10th. at approximately 8:32 PM Eastern time, I was heading north to northwest past the town’s center on a road that led to a more rural section of town. As I drove past the normal line of trees that eventually led to a slight clearing on the left side of the road, and ultimately revealed a lake, I noticed bright lights in the sky that caught my attention. I was traveling rather slowly as I was in no hurry to get home so when I focused my attention on the lights I was able to pull off to the right without any problem. From this vantage point I was able to witness the object in the sky and it appeared to be quite large, triangular in shape, and black. It had large lights on it’s underside, at least three white and one red. It also had one small blinking light. It hovered over the lake making no sounds discernible from my car. It moved with a pivoting action as it reached the shores of each part of the lake and It moved in the direction of each corner as if it had no designated front. It traveled slowly and at no time did I see it accelerate beyond that constant speed. Motivated by curiosity I decided to go to higher location on another nearby road that overlooked lake. Upon reaching my destination I could no longer see the object. I then returned to the original location where again I witnessed the same aircraft as before. I left when other cars started passing, as there was not enough clearance around my car. An interesting side note: The next afternoon, an incident occurred involving a nearby military arsenal. A piece of hot metal, supposedly shrapnel from an exploding shell, went through the roof of a house in Jefferson, N.J. killing a family cat.;40.8897;-74.4847
