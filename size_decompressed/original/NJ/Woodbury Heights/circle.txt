Leaving Work  I saw a bright red object in the sky moving west towards me and my two friends, the red glow started to fade 15 secs into the sighting.   Then it went completely out and I saw a circular object passing directly over me.  It made no sound as it passed and was very difficult to see except for the definitive circular shape.   It disappeared after about a minute traveling further west. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD));39.8136;-75.1508
