I saw a green flash with a tail in the southwest direction in the sky.  It moved in a very fast south west and downward direction. It was too big to be a firework but I thought it was perhaps a shooting star because it seemed to have a firey trail.   My girlfriend Jen saw it as well and asked if I saw it.  I said I did and I told her I thought it was a shooting star.   We didn't call anyone at first because we thought it was a shooting star.  It appeared and was gone in a matter of seconds.;40.9598;-74.1276
