I was taking a walk and noticed an object hovering.  It was north east of Glen Rock, NJ.  I would guess it was the height of an airliner at cruising altitude, but it was hovering.   At first I thought it might be a helicopter or even a parachute but it was too high for that.  I watched it for about 10 minutes then called my husband to come out and see it.   While I was waiting for him to come out I saw a second object.  They both had a white light coming from it.  First I thought it was a reflection from the sun but it looked more like a light coming from the object.   Then a couple of minutes later a third one appeared and the three came together to shape a triangle.   Two had white lights and the third had a green light.   I walked back home to meet my husband and I couldnâ€™t find it again. ((NUFORC Note:  We have confirmed with the witness that the sighting occurred at 08:40 hrs. (EDT) on Monday, April 21st, 2014.

Triangular UFO 300 ft, slow moving not linear, just above trees.;2019-03-30 20:30:00;10 minutes;Triangular UFO 300 ft, slow moving not linear, just above trees I drove home and my son said he saw a UFO.  He said it was triangular with lights on the points and center.  His account was that it was hovering then went up quickly and flew over him. I dismissed it as youthful imagination, however, I also saw the UFO while driving down rock road. It was over the trees, rotating very slowly and following a non-linear path, I tried to get a clear view of it, however, it was further away by the time I did.  I estimate the it was about 200 feet above the trees and about 200-300 wide.  It was not a dronex not a blimp, not a helicopter or plane.  It moved too slowly and meandered.  I don't know what it was.  It had lights on the 3 points which is what gave away its shape and size. I was unable to take photos, unfortunately.  I do not wish to be contacted. One more detail, about 10 days earlier, my sons denied said they saw the same UFO.  I was not present.  My wife thought it was odd, but did not make much of it. We have not seen it since. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have meant to indicate a date of 04/30/2019.  We will e-mail him to inquire as to whether the date above is correct.  PD));40.9598;-74.1276
