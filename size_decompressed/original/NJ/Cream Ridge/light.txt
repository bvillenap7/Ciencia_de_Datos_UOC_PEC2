Unusual amber orb in the nightime sky;2009-03-03 03:00:00;5 Seconds;Unusual amber orb in the nightime sky It was around three in the morning when this strange event occurred. I was at the computer, up much later than I normally would be. The way the room is set up has the computer on a desk facing the window. Since the computer room is on the 2nd floor, it provides a decent view of the sky outside. Anyway, while playing an online game I was suddenly distracted by an extrememly bright, amber light outside the window. I looked up and in the sky was an orb, growing in size and brightness. It became so bright so fast I had to squint and shield my eyes. Once it seemed to reach its peak of brightness it suddenly dissapeared. It was floating right above the treeline, probably a good bit away. It was hard to make out a distance of how far it was away because it was so bright. Right afterwards I ran downstairs and outside to try and get a better view, but the sky was empty except for stars. Looking south I saw a normal airplane, but that was all. I dont know if this was an actual craft or not. It did not move, it was just grew in size and brightness. It was an interesting shade of amber, but what I found strange was the light it emitted did not light up the earth below. Regardless, it was strange enough for me to search it up online and post it here.;40.1393;-74.4605
