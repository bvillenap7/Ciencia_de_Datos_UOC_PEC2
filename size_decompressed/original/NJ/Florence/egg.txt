On June 2, around noon, a shiny metallic object was just sitting in the sky (ZIP 08518). It made no sound and did not move at all the entire time I watched. I took 5 photos and two videos of the object.  The photos show an unusual type of energy on both sides of the object in white, green and red radiating like bright light.;40.1235;-74.8026
