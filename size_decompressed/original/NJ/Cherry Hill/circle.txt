At 8:15 pm on 10/03, I saw a triangle shape made of three distinct objects hovering in the sky. I was driving at the time, and eventually slowed down to make special note of this object. It hovered for over a minute, followed by the objects flying off into seperate directions. This quickly told me it was not a solid triangle with three lights. I could only track one of them flying to the west which shot off at high speed. The objects themselves were all circle/ball shaped with a large bright white center. They all had small blinking red lights around this central white area. They were as big as a dime held at arms length.;39.9004657142857;-74.9922733333333
