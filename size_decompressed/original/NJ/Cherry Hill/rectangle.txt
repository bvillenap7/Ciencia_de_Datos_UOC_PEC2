It had a glassy appeal, like a see through bottom.;2007-09-01 22:00:00;2 minutes;Me, my mom, and my sister were driving home south west towards Voorhees, NJ.  Above the trees, we saw a large light, to big and bright to be coming from a plane.  It was yellow, and looked like a fourescant lightbulb.  It wasn't coming from the ground, no visible ray or projector to be seen.  It had a glassy appeal, like a see through bottom.  At first it seemed like nothing, but then it appeared on the other side of the road after we made a turn.  It followed us for about 20 seconds, then vanished.  I'm not sure if what we saw was an alien ship, but it definetly was an Unidentified Flying Object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
