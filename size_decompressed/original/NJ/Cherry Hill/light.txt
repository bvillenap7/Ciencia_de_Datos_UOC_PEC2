It was about 7-7:30 PM. I was taking some items out of my van. I was facing north, stand at the back of my van. I looked up at the sky to see the stars. The  moon was full and to my right at a 2 O'clock position. I did a double take, some the stars seem to be moving. I heald onto the van door and leaned back so I could look directly over head. There was about 24 points of light, the same as a star moving east to west directly over head. There were no flashing light on white light. They were in no pattern. They were speratic in the sky. They were moving at the same speed. Seemed to faster than a airplan. It no more than 5 min. or less to cross the sky.;39.9004657142857;-74.9922733333333
Super Bright Silent Light Cruising Slowly Across South Jersey - 100% Not a Plane or Meteor.;2013-12-28 18:15:00;2 minutes;Super Bright Silent Light Cruising Slowly Across South Jersey - 100% Not a Plane or Meteor Walked outside this evening about 6:15pm with my dogs and saw a large super bright silent light coming from the west (Philadelphia PA) heading towards the east (Medford, NJ} and going straight overhead at 12 0'clock.   Ran inside and even made my wife come watch it go over.  Living on the flight path of the Philly airport I see and hear jets of all types every minute or so as they approach and know all of the flight paths of even the jets going over at 30 thousand feet. This light was solid with no strobes or color changes and moving slowly with an occasional hesitation and drift then back on a straight course again. It was above the normal landing approach height and crossing over their path, it was also below the height of the jets already at high altitude passing over, unless it was the size of a football stadium. I've never in my life seen anything like this.  Too big and bright for any kind of satellite which I Googled to compare.  I tried to video it on my cell but couldn't capture it as I was fumbling as I was trying to get to my video app and watch the light at the same time.  :(;39.9004657142857;-74.9922733333333
Orange pulsating light  travels slowly then reverses direction and blinks off.;2014-07-04 21:12:00;4 minutes;Orange pulsating light  travels slowly then reverses direction and blinks off. My wife and I were sitting in our kitchen when at 9:12 pm a orange light could be seen through patio slider door in the eastern sky.  I immediately took note of the time and went outside with my wife.  We are quite familiar with air traffic patterns here with Philadelphia Int. Airport 12 miles away and southwest of our location.  We are also in the flight path of helicopters for local news outlets, coast guard, and Mcguire AFB.  We are quite sure none of these can be confused with what we saw. When first observed the orange light was at its brightest and pulsated.  It was moving from the eastern sky towards the southeast at about 30 degrees above horizon.  The light moved much slower than any aircraft I've seen.  It didn't appear to be very large but would appear larger when at its brightest pulsation.  We could not see if the light was attached to a craft.  We watched this light for 4 minutes when it stopped for a brief moment then headed in the opposite direction for a brief time then just appeared to blink off. This was the fourth of July and all of the local Firework shows were canceled due to the high winds left in the wake of hurricane Arthur.  The sky was very clear due to the high front pushing down from Canada. Winds were coming from NNW.  At one point an airliner seemed to be headed straight for the light heading NE.  The airliner was closer to us than the light and it was appx. 2 miles away.  Neither reacted to the other although I think the airline could probably see the light.  They were both close to the same altitude.;39.9004657142857;-74.9922733333333
Two objects, tube shaped, each a solid yellow-white light.;2014-08-28 19:15:00;1 minute;Two objects, tube shaped, each a solid yellow-white light. I was sitting outside on porch after dinner.  I saw 2 long lights, flying east to west, somewhat on the diagonal to each other, one being up front, the other behind it.   The light was completely solid on each craft.  It looked like a long thin light bulb lit up on both objects.   I watched as the object in front disappeared in the clouds, and then the 2nd object was still visible to me, and then it too disappeared in the clouds.  It was very high up.   We have aircraft flying over our house all the time on their descent to Philadelphia International Airport.  It wasn't an airplane that I've ever seen before.  The light on each craft was completely solid the entire time I had it in my visual range.  The color of the light was a yellow-white.  Is it possible it was a military craft?  I've only seen planes with lights at intervals on the body and wings.  These were 2 solid tubes/lights.   The only sound I heard at the time were 2 approaching commerical airliners that follow the normal flight path over our home enroute to Philadelphia International Airport.   The airliners were much lower than the 2 objects I saw heading east to west.;39.9004657142857;-74.9922733333333
6-8 Red-Orange glowing lights were headed from west to east over Cherry Hill around dusk on 10/25/14;2014-10-25 19:45:00;2 minutes;6-8 Red-Orange glowing lights were headed from west to east over Cherry Hill around dusk on 10/25/14 Red-Orange glowing lights were headed from west to east over a late dusky-dark sky.  They floated in the same general direction, but seemed to be a bit more random in their individual approaches and speeds.  Three moved out in front quickly, another set of three came up a little more slowly.    Observed by a white male aged 35 years old, standing outside of a friend's house.;39.9004657142857;-74.9922733333333
I witnessed 7 lights moving at a very high rate of speed going North West across the sky.;2015-03-15 01:30:00;45 seconds;I witnessed 7 lights moving at a very high rate of speed going North West across the sky On 3/15/15, at 1:30am, Over Cherry Hill, NJ, I walked outside my front door, like I usually do on clear nights.  I looked up at the stars.  When I looked up I noticed what looked like the stars were moving.  They were very bright, brighter than anything else in the sky.  There were 7 lights in a line.   As they passed over at a very high rate of speed, and I know they were moving fast because when I watched planes fly over that are very high up and look very small, they move what looks like so slow across the sky. These lights were going 20x's faster.  They made absolutely no sound.  This was Early in the morning, no cars were outside and you could hear a pin drop.  The lights started crossing each others paths, then 3 split off and started moving west while the others went north west but just as they went out of site the three came back.   It was very fast, I would say about 45seconds and they were gone.;39.9004657142857;-74.9922733333333
8-10 Glowing orange orbs traveling from south to north at night.;2020-06-13 22:20:00;3-4 minutes;8-10 Glowing orange orbs traveling from south to north at night. Glowing orange lights moving from South to North. One would be a bright orange glow then another would follow on same path. Each would start to dim then brighten then eventually dim again, moving upward. Eventually they all formed a semi circle that was caught on camera. They were not drones or Chinese lanterns. They were glowing not shining light. They definitely had a path & had converged together in a formation.
