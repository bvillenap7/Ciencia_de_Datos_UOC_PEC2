It blinked as if it were a candle but was slow moving.  Not fast like a meteor.   And it was clear skies.;39.9004657142857;-74.9922733333333

Bright orange fireball seen traveling across night sky from Cherry Hill, NJ, traveling at pretty fast speed.  No sound involved.;2014-07-05 21:35:00;1 minute;Bright orange fireball seen traveling across night sky from Cherry Hill, NJ, traveling at pretty fast speed.  No sound involved. We were sitting outside in our yard, when I noticed what appeared to be a huge orange fireball sailing across the sky, it appeared to be traveling at the speed of an airplane or faster, but it was not an airplane or anything like that.   It appeared to be an orange fireball, no other shape could be detected.  Definitely not anything I have ever seen in the sky before, and there were no fireworks that appeared before or after and no sound created by the fireball, such as an airplane would make, or fireworks would make.   No sound, just the fireball sailing through the sky.   At first, I wondered if it could be a drone, but it just looked like a fireball, then we thought it was a meteor that was going to fall some where.   Definitely, not a shooting star!  It was a bright orange fireball traveling across the sky at a pretty fast speed.;39.9004657142857;-74.9922733333333
