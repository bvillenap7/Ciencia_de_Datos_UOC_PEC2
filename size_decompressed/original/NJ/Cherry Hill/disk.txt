Four radiant bright fire orange bright spheres lit the sky simultaneously.  One dimmed but was very well noticeable still, while the others stayed at full glow..   They moved slowly across the sky in a eastern to western motion.  The lights each turned off and the craft we're see as rotating disks in the air.   When all 4 finally left, about 4-5 minutes went by before another 1 showed up alone that stayed lit for the longest.  I was walking directly under it when it turned its light off and, it kept at my pace until I stopped following.   Was an amazing site for me and the witnesses here.  I almost went without reporting.;39.9004657142857;-74.9922733333333
