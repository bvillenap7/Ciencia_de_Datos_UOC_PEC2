The object moved away at such a speed that we could not see it after one minute. We were driving as the passenger noticed a flying object going speeds faster than any aircraft is capable of.  I, the driver, looked and saw the object as well.  It was traveling away from us and to the right, due southwest.  There were no stars in the sky.  The object was oval and it had four lights on its outside that would become bright in a consecutive order, clockwise.  There were also a clump of lights that remained bright in the center of the oval.  We did not see or hear any strange noise.  The object was fairly low to the ground, so that we could see it in plain view, almost as though it were getting ready to land, however it stayed at that same height.  It was not as low as any building, but it was noticably lower than a plane would fly.  The object might have seemed lower than it was due to its immense size.  It was huge!  After approx. forty-five seconds, the object had moved so far away that it was no longer in sight. the object wad traveled such;39.9004657142857;-74.9922733333333
Blue oval object with very bright flashing white lights on the bottom.;2017-12-07 16:00:00;4 minutes;Blue oval object with very bright flashing white lights on the bottom. I was returning home from a walk, and was approaching the Woodcrest shopping Center on Browning Road, when I saw what I thought was just a bird taking off near the roof of the shopping center.  Then I noticed that it looked more like a balloon.  I thought it was pretty cool that someone let a balloon go, and was probably just watching to see how high it would go.   So, I also stopped and watched its ascent.  It was almost directly above me (and only a couple of hundred yards away at most), when I realized that it had very bright white lights blinking at the bottom of it--almost taking up the entire object.  I also realized that it was more oval than cylindrical, and almost the color of a blue pearl.  It was definitely not an airplane or helicopter.   I just watched for a couple of minutes in wonder as it gradually sailed across the sky, and then walked away. I just dismissed as something I didn't understand (a weather balloon???).  But I got thinking about it again and went online to see if there were any other reports of it, and found this siteâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Oval shape white orb with tail;2020-10-24 00:16:00;4-6 seconds;Oval shape white orb with tail Went outside in my backyard to let the dogs out. As I looked  up in the sky I seen a white oval orb with a trail traveling in straight direction  from North to south. The rate of speed was like nothing I seen before in my life. The object made no sound. The approximate hight of the traveling object was hard to interpret due to the speed, so was the size of the oval size whitish orb.   Could be wrong but seemed like it was flying twice to three times as hight as a landing aircraft ( which we se very often due to proximity to PHL airport) but it was traveling at a speed I never seen before an object to  move in the sky. The trail it left behind is something also I never seen before in the night sky because it moved at same speed and disappeared at same  proportional rate as the white oval was moving.;39.9004657142857;-74.9922733333333
