Round shape metallic object flying in the sky.;2011-08-03 13:15:00;6 seconds;Round shape metalic object flying in the sky. ok so I was sitting in the parked car.  I looked up in the sky at about 50 degree, I saw a round shape metallic object. It looked like soap bubble but I don't think it was soap bubble because the place i looked at is industrial area, and it was not transparent unlike soap bubble. I think the radius of the circle was ~2 inch. visit the link for photo description.  Other unique thing that happened at the same time is the plane passed above it (but far away from the object but probably at the same speed as the plane was going.)
