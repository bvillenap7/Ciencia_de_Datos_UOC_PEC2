I followed the light from west to east and noticed there were no blinking lights.  I thought I saw the light moving a bit chaotic, but the lack of stars to reference it against made it difficult.  It wasn't zigzagging, but sort of slowing down and speeding up, slowing down and speeding up.  I thought, since my reference wasn't great that it could be an airplane or helicopter, and i just couldn't see the beacons, and as I thought this, it slowly faded away to nothing.  The object was simply a light.  Again, I thought this could be an aircraft, but the lack of blinking lights made me think.  If it continued without fading, I'd assume it were a satellite or the shuttle, but the fact that it disappeared made me question its make up.;39.3212;-74.5977
