Bright UFO over NJ;2013-09-12 06:45:00;30 seconds;Bright UFO over NJ My first ever ufo experience. I was leaving the gym morning like 645.  i look up saw plane.  Behind it was a bright object looked like a star or far off planet since it wasn't flickering and was solid no biggie.  But I noticed it was moving so I went to car to get my phone.  It was so far off behind the plane.  Then it disappeared behind the clouds.  So I assumed it was just a star or planet and it was the clouds moving that gave me the feeling it was the object moving.  Then I look up again and this time recorded it.  Moving pretty fast for how far it was.  I have it on video as well.;40.8583;-74.0703
