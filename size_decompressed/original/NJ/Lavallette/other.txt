I could also see what looked like an Enormous Cylinder far behing/in front?  Like a water tornado.  Whatever it was was huge.;39.9768;-74.071

Whatever it was was huge. Update:  I was watching a documentary called watchers 7 physical proof to my amazement the video starts off with a scientist filming a ufo sighting off the coast of Kumburgaz Turkey  the reason I mentioned this is because the 4 orange lights in that video ate exactly like the lights I saw, though I saw 6 lights.  They were the exact same colors, the exact same formation, identical to the distance out over the water and the scientist states that it's a clear night with a very bright moon.  That too was exactly the same as the night I saw them.  Mine were off the coast of Lavallette, NJ, on 03/11/201, 7 you can research conditions.  Crystal clear night, full or almost full moon.   I have checked every night since, no luck.  Watch that doc if you want to see exactly what I'm talking about/ they looked like.;39.9768;-74.071
