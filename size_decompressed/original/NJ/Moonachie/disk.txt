UFO with Bright White Lights at around 1:30am;2020-12-12 01:35:00;4 minutes;UFO with Bright White Lights at around 1:30am As I was driving home from my girlfriendâ€™s house at around 1:30am, I noticed a saucer-shaped object flying at a low altitude. I almost dismissed it as a blimp, but then realized that a blimp would not be flying that fast and at 1:30am in the morning. The UFO had VERY bright white lights and I could definitely say it was not a plane. There was one pulsating light in the middle. As I made my way down the road I continued to follow it. It dipped lower as I turned onto my street until I could not follow it any longer. It seemed as though it was making a landing. I live near Teterboro Airport and would love to know if this event could be debunked or if someone else saw what I saw .
