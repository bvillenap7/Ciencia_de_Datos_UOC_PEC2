Saw a craft with 4 lights, flying over my house, making a low humming sound.;1999-07-17 22:00:00;15 seconds;Saw a craft with 4 lights, flying over my house, making a low humming sound. I have believed in UFO's for some time, but have never seen one. Saturday, July 17th, 1999 I think I may have seen one. It was about 10:00 at night, and was a clear night. I was throwing something into the trashcan out at the curb, and when I turned around and walked towards the house I looked up at the sky. That is when I saw something that looked like an airplane, but the lights were formatted backwards. Flying west to east, there were three white lights, two in the front, leading it, and one in the back. There was also a steady red light in the center, which was not blinking, but glowing faintly. There was no sound like a normal plane would make, but a low humming sound. There were also no other planes in the area. I watched it until it passed I did not have any cameras, so I could not get a picture of it. I always look up at night and look for things, but I did not expect to really find anything around here. I think I saw the common triangle UFO.;39.7449999999999;-75.0923999999999
triangle, 3 white lights on corners, one red light in center;1999-07-17 22:00:00;2 min;triangle, 3 white lights on corners, one red light in center I have believed in UFO's for some time, but have never seen one.

I think I saw the common triangle UFO. It was passing over my house, at a distance of about 300 feet up, and 100 away. it was moving west to east. I have always been watching the skies, and I know what one is supposed to do if something is spotted. I made sure I remembered where I saw it, day, time, weather conditions, anyone else around, anything else strange, etc. all I noticed which was strange was there were no other sounds at all. It was a fairly nice night, and usually people have their dogs out side. There are usually bugs out making noise as well. I heard nothing, absolutely nothing. It was strange, the only thing I heard was the low humming. When it left, I can not remember anything like normal sounds starting up again, but I would not be surprised if they did. This is almost exactly what I saw.;39.7449999999999;-75.0923999999999
observed UFO at two different times within 1-2 minutes time;2000-06-27 22:50:00;1-2 minutes;observed UFO at two different times within 1-2 minutes time As I was driving home from work that night I noticed 2 large headlights in the sky about 10 o'clock to my position.  I was at a stoplight when I thought that it was very close to the ground (est. 500-600ft) and couldn't imagine an airplane being in such close proximity.  It was at this point when I realized that it appeared to be stationary and not moving.  It was approx. 1/8-1/4 mile down range and to my left as I was at the traffic light and as I continued on my way the road curves to the left and the object was now directly to my left about 9 o'clock and still 500-600 ft in the air.  At this point I stopped my car in the middle of the road and rolled down the window to try and hear if it was a hovering helicopter or something.  It was dead quiet and now I could see that there were two distinct red pulsing lights to the rear of this object.  They pulsed slowly and intermittently.  I stared at this object in utter disbelief all the while waiting for another car to come by so I could verify this with someone else.  There were no other cars around.  I couldn't believe it and as I continued to stare at this thing for about 30-45 seconds I know it was completely still in its position.  Very bright forward lights with no defraction of light, by the way, and slowly pulsing red rear lights.  After this duration of time, this thing completely catapulted forward from its position roughly 1/4-1/2 mile away within 1/2-1 second.  When it did this I had a distinct guttural vibration of some sort and it took off like that and slowed immediately.  I literally screamed and took off to come home.  After I made my left turn at the next light  I knew I could see this object about 1/4 mile down the road and to my left because it was a clear view from there.  As I passed this area I could see the red pulsing lights, still the same distance above the ground but it looked to be about 3/4 mile away and it seemed to be slowly moving in that direction (away from me).  I made my right turn to enter my housing! development (300 feet away) and as I was going down this road I kept looking in my rearview mirror to see if I could see anything at all.  As I was driving down this winding road, all of a sudden this craft of somesort appears at my 11o'clock and coming directly overhead on a slight angle so that as it passed over I would then be at my 5 o'clock position.  It still seemed to be about 500-600 feet above ground and I again stopped my car in the middle of the road and rolled down my window to stick my head out to get a better view.  I was literally shaking with fear and/or excitement, I guess.  As it passed over me very slowly, I could make out what seemed to be underneath structure of some sort with 4 additional lights facing downward.  Because of the location of the red still pulsing lights, I had the distinct impression that it was sort of triangular in shape but more like a wedge/boomerang.  It was moving very slowly and didn't make any noise at all.  It was extremely quiet and it traveled out of my sightline (many trees line this street)and I raced home thinking it was going to turn around and follow me.  I don't know for sure if it was the same craft as I observed prior to this, but I am convinced it was the same shape and size.;39.7449999999999;-75.0923999999999
Seen something, Triangular in shape, heading on a north easterly path over our farm in Sewell NJ. NOT a plane.;2012-07-17 01:10:00;2 minutes;Seen something, Triangular in shape, heading on a north easterly path over our farm in Sewell NJ. NOT a plane. The object was moving in a North east direction.  I saw it approach from the south west and at first I thought it was an Airplane.  It was a little different so I did a double take and walked back out to our front field.  I saw it was heading in my direction so I decided to wait for it to pass me just to verify it was an airplane.   As it approached I saw it slightly gain altitude and then descend again.  It was moving back and forth to the right and left, but very slightly. That's when my suspicion began to get to me.  As it got nearly right overhead I knew it had a triangular shape and was not a typical aircraft that I'm used to seeing, No flashing lights,  solid white light in front and on the underside three to four lights across the tail with one in the back of it.   The fact that alarms me is the sound it made, hardly a whisper.   The object was approximately several hundred feet into the air.  About as high as my one of my D stage rocket engines.   Tonight is a clear night with hardly any over cast or clouds,  stars are clearly visible.;39.7449999999999;-75.0923999999999
