Large star ufo;2012-06-23 22:11:00;5 minutes;Large star ufo I have seen ufos every night for the last week.  I sit on my back porch and watch them. Every night it seems to be the same object.  It looks like a large star but it moves across the sky.   The object I saw tonight was moving slowly at first, but then it went around in a small circle and took off east.  It was gone in less than a second.;39.7449999999999;-75.0923999999999
