Over 100 lights in formation traveled from east to west slowly at a low elevation.;2013-04-27 21:50:00;10 minutes;Over 100 lights in formation traveled from east to west slowly at a low elevation. Upon arriving home, I saw approximately 10 lights in formation traveling from the eastern horizon in a westerly direction.  The lights were close together and traveling slowly.  I stopped to watch as I thought they may be helicopters as they were to low and reveling to slow to be airplanes.  As I watched a line of lights appeared from the same area and traveled ion a similar path.  The lights continued to appear for over ten minutes.  As they traveled west they faded from sight.  At one point I counted over 80 of these lights in close formation all traveling the same speed.  The 80 lights did not include the lights that faded from sight or the additional lights that continued to appear for the next five minutes.  I was able to capture 4 seconds of video before my phone battery died.  My wife was on the phone with me for the last five minutes.  She arrived home to see two to four of the lights before they faded out of sight.  I called the police and they confirmed peopl! e were reporting lights.  The stated they believed they were lighted balloons.  These were not balloons.;39.7449999999999;-75.0923999999999
