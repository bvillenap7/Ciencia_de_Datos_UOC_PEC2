Bright white circular objects seen for 2 hours, slowly moving across the sky.;2019-10-05 17:30:00;2 hours;Bright white circular objects seen for 2 hours, slowly moving across the sky. While using a drone and looking up in the sky at the drone, a bright white round object was spotted in the sky around 5:00 pm EST.  The object hovered at an even height, slowly, and in a straight line moved from North West to North East.  As the object moved further East, a second object of the same size and brightness followed its same slow path from West to East.  Eventually by twilight, the objects slowly retreated higher into the atmosphere eventually going out of eyesight.  This lasted for about 2 hours until the objects were out of naked eye view. The objects were round and bright white.  Occasionally, the the first object would produce a bright red ring along its outer edge which would last for a few seconds and then “turn off”.   They also appeared to have a grayish aura around them and along the center of its sphere, similar to diesel fuel or smog. Conditions were sunny, no clouds, clear blue skies.  Temps in the 70 degree range that day. I also have pictures and video.  Although not very high quality, and a shaky hand on the video (16 seconds long), it does give a good representation of what we saw that day.;39.7449999999999;-75.0923999999999
