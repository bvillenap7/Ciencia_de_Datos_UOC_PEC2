Silver earbud shaped object in clear blue sky, with an image provided.;2019-07-11 08:46:00;<1 minute;Silver earbud shaped object in clear blue sky, with an image provided. At roughly 8:46 PM, I was sitting on my bed watching YouTube with my phone.  There are two windows in my bedroom, one of which is directly adjacent to my bed.  I looked out of that window, and there was a distinct object in the sky that looked silver.  I would think of as simply a star, but at that moment the sky was a clear pale blue and there were no other stars in the sky.  The sky was completely clear excepting this object.  I'm near sighted, so I couldn't see it properly.  It was flying (I reckon) as fast as a plane would, and assumed that was it, but either way, I got my phone and took four photos.  The first, third and fourth photos were blurred and distorted, but the third one was clear.  It is linked below. https://i.ibb.co/2M0typ3/20190711-204602.jpg   The object is shaped like a silver earbud and is distinctly visible from the photo. For the record, I do not know how to photoshop outside of MS Paint, and have much better things to do with my time than to try and trick people regarding something, aliens, that I don't think exist.  I send this because it's been sitting in the photo section of my phone for the last 3 months and it's creeping me out.  I don't believe in aliens but any other conclusions are simply illogical.  I send this in the hopes that you at the UFOCenter, who deal with false reports consistently, can  give me a logical conclusion so my mind can focus on other things.  To rephrase, I did NOT doctor this photo.  The only thing I have done to it is convert it to a URL from my phone. Thank you.;39.7449999999999;-75.0923999999999
