I was looking at the nights sky as I do almost every night. So I am pretty familiar with the configuration of the stars, the constellations, and air traffic patterns being I live 10 minutes from a local international airport.   I observed a star at approx RA 332 67 DEC and approx 43 degrees NE of my position.  I noticed it moving exactly like a satellite (same brightness ,speed, and trajectory) which made me think it was a satellite.   But then it stopped, stayed stationary right next to the constellation Cassiopeia, then moved in the complete opposite direction made a left turn and went all the way around the constellation so that it ended up on the left side if Cassiopeia.   It then remained there for and addition two minutes until cloud cover moved in and I lost sight of it.    I see satellites every night, I watch them move across the sky.  And this was no satellite.;39.4276;-74.7075
