Points of light in the night sky moving erratically and pulsing.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible stars??  PD));2010-03-19 19:00:00;On going;Points of light in the night sky moving erratically and pulsing Hello, I am currently living in Mays Landing, NJ.  For the past three months, I have watched the same UFO moving in the night sky over the Pine Barrens.  Every night without fail, it moves. It is also the brightest light in the sky, which also emits a faint pulse.  I believe it is masking itself as a star by maintaining a stationary position outside our gravity well giving the appearance of a star progressing across the night sky. Every night I watch it move in short erratic patterns, vertical, horizontal and circular, which I believe is to maintain its fixed position. In the past month I have discovered several other similar lights in the sky that I had originally thought were stars. My father, two of my sisters, my brother in-law, my mothers first cousin and her house mate and two of my friends, have all confirmed what I have been watching for the past three months. I do not drink or take any kind of mind or mood altering drugs.  All of the above mentioned people were sober at the time they confirmed my sighting.  I am not looking to be put in the public eye.  I just want somebody to come out and verify my sighting, which has been ongoing for the past three months. PS This is not a one time occurance!  It is an on going event every night. So if you decide to come out, you won't be dissapointed! If what I'm seeing is real, and if I'm right about what I believe it is I'm actually seeing.  Then the ramifications of this sighting, will be earth shattering news. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Possible stars??
