Green, triangular object seen falling from sky.;2019-02-02 22:03:00;6 seconds;Green, triangular object seen falling from sky. I was driving, going about 40mph, when I noticed a green, triangular shaped object falling from the sky.  I noticed it while looking out the left side of my windshield.  It took approximately 6 seconds to go from where I could see it in the sky to behind buildings and trees.  The point of the triangle was facing downward and the top part of the triangle was broken up in pieces.  The green was bright emerald and seemed to be emitting from the triangle itself.;39.4276;-74.7075
