close encounter with blue sphere of light;2012-06-27 22:00:00;1 minute;close encounter with blue sphere of light My son witnessed something extraordinary tonight 1 hour prior to having to drive to the airport and pick us up- family returning from vacation. He went outside to bring in 4 empty trash cans and upon reaching the street he saw a baseball size sphere of blue light that traveled in a straight line through the woods on the other side of the street. Initially the object was about 1 block away and moving towards and in front of him. It flew past him and seemed to be moving fairly constantly and he said rough estimate of 15 mph. After watching this for a couple of seconds fear set in, hair stood on end and feeling some shock he started back for the house. He dropped the cans in hand and started to head back up the driveway but then this damned thing appears right by his head and he swipes his hand at it and misses. He swipes his hand at it again and he says he hit it and it hit the ground with a thud. He felt a temperature change when his hand made contact but he ! couldn't tell if it was hot or cold. He says it vibrated on the ground and then disappeared. [I'm not clear on exactly how this event ended. I need to talk further with him]. I know this sounds crazy but I do believe him. My son is an impressive person and highly regarded both professionally and in college. He was shaken by this so I know something real happened. I am wondering if its possible this was ball lightning or if anyone else has had a similar experience. Thanks for any feedback you may have.;39.4276;-74.7075
