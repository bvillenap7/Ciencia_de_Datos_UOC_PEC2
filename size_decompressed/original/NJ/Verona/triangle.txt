Perfect flying V but with lights, no birds or a plane.;2013-11-29 23:12:00;10 seconds;Perfect flying V but with lights, no birds or a plane Just saw a perfect flying V of lights, definitely not birds and no sound at all.  Not normal plane lights and flew in perfect V formation and glided perfectly across the sky.  Looked like a bird formation but was lit up and coasted too perfectly to be birds.
