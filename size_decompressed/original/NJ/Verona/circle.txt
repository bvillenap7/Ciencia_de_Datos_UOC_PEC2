2 unusual crafts, fully lit, flying erratic followed by sustained stillness;2019-06-01 23:30:00;2 minutes;2 unusual crafts, fully lit, flying erratic followed by sustained stillness On June 1, 2019, at 22:30, son and I driving on Grove Avenue, and noticed 2 lit objects we assumed were drones, but based on erratic movement then sudden sustained stillness – we then revised our take as maybe military helicopter.   We tried to pull over but cars behind us only allowed us to slow down.  They were clear, bright white light – perhaps oval or round, and seemed to be low-flying followed by a definite full stop.  By time we turned around – they were gone.   I’ve seen thousands of aircraft and son has seen tons of recreational drones.  There was nothing familiar about this experience.;40.8295;-74.2456
