Red fiery balls of light disappearing into sky.;2013-09-21 23:30:00;15 minutes;Red fiery balls of light disappearing into sky While at Verona Park, my friend and I happened to look up and noticed a red light flying in the sky.  While observing it, we noticed that it was flying upward towards space and suddenly disappeared.  We observed many planes in the area and their pattern to determine that this was not a regular aircraft.   A few moments later, we noticed two more coming up above the trees.  They traveled in the same direction as the first, and disappeared almost in the same area as the first.  Each red ball disappeared slightly apart from the others. From our angle, it appeared to be a ball of fire, not huge, smaller than an observable plane.  Within 15 minutes or so, we observed 6 of these red balls follow the same path and watched them disappear.;40.8295;-74.2456
