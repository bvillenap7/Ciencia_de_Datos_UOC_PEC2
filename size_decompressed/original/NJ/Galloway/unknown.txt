I dismissed it somewht because there had been thunderstorms overnight.  As the noise grew nearer, I tried to get up and couldn't at first. I was conscious, but couldn't get up. Finally, I went to the window and looked outside but couln't see anything--clouds overhead. But, I still could hear a lound, oscillating, roaring noise hovering very near. By now my husband was awake and he heard it too.  We live near an airforce base and a public airport so I hear planes traversing regularly. Could this be a plane? If so, when did they start to hover?;39.4722;-74.4566
