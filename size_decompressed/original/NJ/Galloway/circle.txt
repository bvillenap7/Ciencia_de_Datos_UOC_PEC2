Looked like 2 very bright stars together.  As I watched , it started to move--jumping silently - no sound.  I live near the FAA center in pomona,NJ.  I went out to the front yard away from trees and it was still there just jumping  side to side- bright white.  A small plane flew towards it.  Went back to back door, let dogs in -- it was still there.   Don't want to call police they will think Iam crazy .;39.4722;-74.4566
