The next day I was looking at the picture and noticed there were 2 little white dots in the right corner of the sky close to the tree line next to a water tower.  I then noticed another little white circle in the far left corner of the picture.  When I zoomed in on that I saw 2 more little white dots far away only visible by zooming in down and to the right of the one on the far left, there is alos another one to the left of the 2 little ones I just mentioned.  The bottom one to the right of the water tower seems to have what looks like a visible shawdow on the bottom witch suggest it is really there in the sky.  I alos have 2 on video moveing in the sky in snaps o took of us driveling the Jeep.  You can clearly see one move over the water tower and one move super fast across the sky.  I didnâ€™t see that at first in the video but was able to by going! trew it frame by frame in my camera roll but you can see it in real time once youve seen it frame by frame.;39.4722;-74.4566
