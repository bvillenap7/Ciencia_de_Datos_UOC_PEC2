I was walking my dogs at 5:45pm, when the fastest strobe light I've ever seen caught my attention.By the time I could focus,3 more appeared, in a triangle shape. The 3 started changing places real fastwhile the first stood still. Then they all lined up in a straight line with the first one and moved quicker the I could even imagine.And they disappeared, I stood in awe not sure what I had seen.;40.7929;-74.9131
Black round shiny object.  ((anonymous report));2019-03-04 12:00:00;3:00;Black round shiny object A black round ball.  Shiny.  Moving very slow below the clouds.  Faint aura that looked almost electric.  No sound.  The black color was unusual.  It moved with a slow glide and not like a machine.  It went from west to east and I watched for a good 3 min.;40.7929;-74.9131
