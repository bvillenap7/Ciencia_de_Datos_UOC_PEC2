I'm not 100% positive on the direction but pretty sure it was west, slightly north.  I can show you the exact spot and location the crafts were flying if need be. I saw two lights 3-4 times larger than aircraft lights( if your looking up in the sky they were the same size as golf balls would be directly in your face) flying parallel (they looked to be 2 feet apart from where i was, much further up in the sky obviously) for 4 seconds then they crossed paths, and then crossed again to go back to the same parallel formation they were in originally.  They then got lost in the clouds. There are lots of aircraft flying around here but i know for a fact is was not any common aircraft that any normal being on this planet knows about.;40.8342;-74.1014
