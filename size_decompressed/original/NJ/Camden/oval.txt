strange orange circles or discs passing overhead;1996-07-05 22:00:00;2min. each time;strange orange circles or discs passing overhead My wife and I went to a Sting concert at the then named Blockbuster Center in Camden,N.J,  It was a beautiful evening with a crystal clear sky. During the concert Sting had a song where the words in the song werelook up to the sky,so I did and at that time I happened to notice four orange circles or discs,next to each other but staggered, moving in a west to east direction.  At arms length,they were about the size of a dime. I nudged my wife and showed her what I was looking at.  At the same time some other people around us were looking and pointing at them also. They moved at a steady rate of speed to the west til out of sight.  I kept my eyes watching the sky after that and two more times, I don't know if it was the same four or different ones but in similar formations we were passed over again by these orange discs.  I searched the papers and the news the next day but nothing was being reported. I never had a sighting before or since this one but I still wonder what they were.;39.9400611111111;-75.1013444444444
