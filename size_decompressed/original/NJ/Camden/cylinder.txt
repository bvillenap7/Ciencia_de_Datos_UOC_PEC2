I was standing at my boyfriend's truck.  Behind me was a dark alley to my left, was a small field then a couple houses, to my right was a big field of grass and in front of me was a couple houses.  The cylinder shaped object came from my right side, up in the sky slowly descending till it was a low enough to see very clearly.  I noticed it because the object was rotating as it was moving slowly.  The flying object was cylindrical in shape, kind of like the things at the bank u put your stuff in then it gets sucked up.  It had lights around it like dots, green dot, white dot, red dot, the lights outlined the object and the lights around the top of cylinder spun in circle as the object rotated (if on a clock 11-5) I looked up and pointed it out to my boyfriend as the object hovered over me for a moment while rotating.  A few people over by the house a in front of me also looked up because I was pointing up telling my boyfriend to look.  The object started moving again still going to the left of me but also rising.  After it got to a certain height, (well above where the airplanes fly in the area I was in) there was a flash of light then the object was gone.  This was definitely not any kind of aircraft that is normally in that area?  I'm curious if anyone else saw this?;39.9400611111111;-75.1013444444444
