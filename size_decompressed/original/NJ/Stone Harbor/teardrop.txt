object dropped into the ocean, only to reappear ,and then go up behind the moon;2004-05-09 01:45:00;7-10min;object dropped into the ocean, only to reappear ,and then go up behind the moon again i saw what appeared to be a craft drop like a stone, into the atlantic ocean,  app 50-100 miles off the coast of new jersey, i wrote last month on this same object and im convinced that this tecnology lives in the ocean.BUT that same night5/9/04 i watched it drop into the ocean, and when it did it changed shape, from a ball like form, to tear dropshape ,and created a green sorta foggieish color that dissapeared, and then re-appeared on the horizion,it rose out of the ocean, and then it took off out of the ocean at a rate of what i counted as10 seconds befor it went behind the moon, not in front , but behind the moon , and i watched it profusily .this object never appeared over or on top of the moon ,leafding me to believe it maby lives on the dark side of the moon, or is hidden from the moon so we cant see whats goin on.;39.0559;-74.7652
