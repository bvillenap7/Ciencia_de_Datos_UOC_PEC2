Multiple fireballs North of Stone Harbor;2011-07-30 22:15:00;5 - 10 minutes;Multiple fireballs North of Stone Harbor Walking on the Stone Harbor beach the night of July 30th, 2011, between 10 PM and 10:30 PM,  my fianc√© and I spotted an orange/red fireball,  which we first thought was a star as it was stationary.   While looking at this, it started in an eastward direction towards the ocean until disappearing.  About 15 minutes later we turned around to now see 3 of these same fireballs in a triangular shape hovering very high.  They were then joined by a 4th fireball that seemed to have come off the ground.  The fourth was far behind the first 3 but again they all started moving in an eastward direction and disappeared.  They did not become dim as they were moving away, they were still very bright before vanishing.  Another peculiar fact, we tried on 2 different camera phones to take pictures and video of this, but they would not show up on our phones.;39.0559;-74.7652
