Strange High Speed Aerial Object;2006-11-17 00:00:00;about 15 minutes;Strange High Speed Aerial Object Was out on the deck having a cigar at around midnight, witnessed a strange flying object for about 15 to 20 minutes.  My friend pointed it out first, and we both watched it for quite a while.  I usually don't buy into all the UFO/Alien stuff, but I'm convinced that this was no conventional aircraft. Both my friend and I are experienced sailors and have spent considerable time on the ocean in and around the area.  Neither of us had ever seen anything like it.  It was triangular in shape (as best as I could tell given the extremily bright lights it had), and was moving in erratic patterns at reasonably high altitude.  Given the high speed and erratic movements, we determined it was certainly not a helicopter or any conventional civilian aircraft.  The lights it emmitted were red and white.  Didn't notice and noise or sounds that could be heard over the din of the ocean.  I've never seen anything move so fast and change directions so abruptly.  All of this took place in the eastern sky over the atlantic.  Not sure if its related, but there was lots of military aircraft visable in the area on Saturday, November 18.;39.0559;-74.7652
