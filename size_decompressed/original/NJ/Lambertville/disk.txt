Unknown flying craft seen over West Amwell Twp, Hunterdon Co, NJ Oct 23,2011 7:30pm.;2011-10-23 19:30:00;2 minutes;Unknown flying craft seen over West Amwell Twp, Hunterdon Co, NJ Oct 23,2011 7:30pm. My wife saw it out the kitchen window (facing south west). She went out to see if the neighbors were screwing around with fireworks or something.  She ended up screaming for me to come out side and look out over the neighbors... Is that what I think it is, she asked?   I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  It was bright white, saucer shaped craft with a red blinking light at the top and a red blinking light at the bottom.  It made absolutely no noise what so ever! I ran in the house and grabbed my field glasses and looked at it again and it appeared to have sequentialy flashing strobes and what looked to be a string of windows about a third of the way up from the bottom continuing around the craft. It appeared to be spinning.  It was heading from the east (Ringoes NJ) to the south west(towards Lambertville NJ)and it seemed to be following Route 202 southbound at approximately 800 to 1000 ft of alt.  At a distance of 2 miles it was 1 and 1/2 thumbs wide and 3/4 of a thumb tall.  In 43 years of living in West Amwell, Hunterdon County, NJ, I never saw anything like this. I have heard on facebook that it may have been a blimp, but I am a private pilot(around avaition equipment quite a bit) and I think I know what a blimp looks like by now. It scared me enough to chase my family inside, turn off the lights and  call 911 and report it to Hunterdon County Dispatch. Of course, the craft flew off before the police could see it. I didn't have enough time to take a picture, but other people saw it, including some of my son's friends and their parents. Please post any info you can as we are scared shitless, and the local authorities and the faa aren't any help!;40.3751;-74.9252
