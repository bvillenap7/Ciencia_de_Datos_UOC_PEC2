2 Oval Craft split into 4 Craft Nearby Ft. Dix / McGuire AFB Broad daylight!;2009-12-23 15:20:00;20-30 seconds;2 Oval Craft split into 4 Craft Nearby Ft. Dix / McGuire AFB Broad daylight! While observing the moon over McGuire AFB to the east something caught the corner of my eye kind of overhead at 90 degrees. As I looked up I observed 2 oval shaped objects about half the length of a commercial airliner. The objects appeared silvery almost liquid silver. They were approximatley 1/2 half a mile from each other moving from west to east - towards the Ft.Dix / Mcguire AFB location. These objects moved at a high rate of speed at least 8-10 times faster than any commercial or military craft that I have seen in my lifetime. As they traveled parallel to each other towards the military installations I observed each one of them simultaneously split into 2 craft making now a total of 4. This must be about 10-13 seconds into the observation at this point they were approximatley over or very near the bases now and I observed all 4 of the objects turn abruptly to the north and immediately vanish. As I stood there looking around to see if someone else was around that maybe saw this I took my cell phone out to call my wife and tell her of this extraordinary incident, I looked to the sky where this began and there was a single one flying even faster than the first ones. I had the cell phone inmy hand ,hit the camera button on the side aimed as quickly as I could hoping to capture this on my phone. I was gone in 5 -10 seconds. Not a sound at all was heard from this. What is even more odd is the air traffic during this time and even 5 mins afterwards was non-existant. I am dumfounded by this and hope that I read about someone else that maybe saw these things.;40.0664;-74.6883
