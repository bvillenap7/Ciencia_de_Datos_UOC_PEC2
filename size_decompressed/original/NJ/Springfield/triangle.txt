My friend & I were driving home south on the Garden State Parkway when we saw a large light in the sky straight ahead.  We continued to drive when we saw that it did not move.   As we traveled 8 miles we could see it bec ome larger and notice details on it.  As we turned west on rt. 78/24 we could see clearly that it was outlined in very large white circles of light around an irregular triangle. The body was pale green light and above and below the triangle was a shimmering red light.  It made no sound and hung in the air about 10-12 minutes that we saw it.   It was low--maybe 600 feet high  and very large.   On the roadside 4 motorcycles were parked and the drivers were standing watching it.  This is close and to the west of Newark airport.;40.6998;-74.3191
