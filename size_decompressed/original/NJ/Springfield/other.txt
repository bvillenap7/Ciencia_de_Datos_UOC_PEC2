iT LOOKED LIKE A LIT-UP HOT AIRBALLOON THAT MOVED FASTER THAN A HOT AIRBALLOON;2003-08-30 23:00:00;20 minutes;iT LOOKED LIKE A LIT-UP HOT AIRBALLOON THAT MOVED FASTER THAN A HOT AIRBALLOON It was around 11:00pm I was sitting on my front porch with my husband and friend.  My hhusband had the most odd look on his face. . .I asked what is wrong and he pointed up to the sky and there we saw something I have never seen before.  My husband, myself and our friend stepped off the porch to get a closer look.  In the sky it looked like a hot airballoon that was all lit up and on the bottow there were blinking lights. . .we watched and asked what it could be . . it moved faster than a hot airballoon and it for sure was not a blimp or airplane. . .we have no idea what it could have been. . but it was unidentified! ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from the same source.  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed a blimp, or some type of terrestrial type aircraft.  In any event, we did not receive multiple other reports from New Jersey for this time period, which we would expect to have been the case, if indeed there had been a dramatic sighting in that populated area of the country.  However, there were many other sightings from across the North American continent for this date.  Please see other reports for August 30th.  PD));40.6998;-74.3191
