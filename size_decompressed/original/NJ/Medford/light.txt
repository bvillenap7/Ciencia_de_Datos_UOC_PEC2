Unusual red/orange steady ball of light witnessed by three separate neighbors.;2017-12-27 19:10:00;2-3 minutes;Unusual red/orange steady ball of light witnessed by three separate neighbors. Myself and two neighbors witnessed red/orange steady light in sky traveling southeast.  Single ball of light, never blinked.  Traveled similar speed as other aircraft that are usually seen in the sky, but flight path direction was unusual from normal aircraft/helicopter/airport or military base traffic in our area.  I got the attention of one neighbor who watched light when I saw it and agreed it was unusual.  Another neighbor later walked by and asked me ifI just witnessed the light that she observed as well...she said she attempted to photograph light but it did not show up in picture.;39.8602;-74.8247000000001
