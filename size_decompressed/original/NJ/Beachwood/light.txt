Four  unown objects in sky in a perfect symetric pattern with many witnesses present.;2009-09-19 21:00:00;ten minutes;Four  unown objects in sky in a perfect symetric pattern with many witnesses present. On this date i was picking up my sister from surf taco in seaside park. This is on an island and in order to get here you must cross a bridge which connects to the main highway which is rt.37.Going over the bridge we witnessed four lights off in the distance directly over the town of beachwood which is some distance away.  It was a clear night so this was all very visible especially on top of the bridge.  The four lights were in a perfectly straight line starting high then going lower towards the ground.  They were not stars because they were to low to the ground and not planes because they just hovered there. The line was diagonal and teh objects seemed to be in a pattern that was the perfect distance between each one. All at once two of the objects completely dissapeared and the others two began moving away. They were visible for ten minutes untill they were all gone. It was one of the wierdest situations ive dealt with and was something i have never seen befo! re.  The wierdest part was that my other sister who is fifteen was in beachwood at the time with her friends and saw a object light up in the sky and disapear. They all told the parents about this and the onject they saw seemed to be the same we one we saw froma  distance.;39.9301;-74.2053
