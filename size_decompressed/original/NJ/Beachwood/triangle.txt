Odd triangular shaped hovering object.;2015-04-12 21:30:00;5 minutes;Odd triangular shaped hovering object. Saw 3 dots of light in the sky and when we drove past it, it was actually a triangular shaped object.   The object was not moving horizontally, rather it appeared to be descending more in a vertical direction.   The lights on the side were white and the one in the middle was an alternating red and orange light.;39.9301;-74.2053
