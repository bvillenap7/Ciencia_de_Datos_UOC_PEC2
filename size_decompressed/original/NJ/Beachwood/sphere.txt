At approximately 1:30 am on the morning of April 1st, 2019, ((i know the timing is terrible because of the date but i have never been more frightened in my life and this is NOT a joke)) i witnessed what i thought was a meteorite falling in the sky.  i am laying in my bed and i saw the event occurring out of my open window.  i turned to watch the meteorite and almost vomited when i realised it had FROZEN IN MIDAIR.  i watched it float for around a full minute, before it silently separated into several large pieces.  i am unsure if these were all seperate aircraft or not but..  they all just floated there for another half a minute.  in the time it took for my blood to run cold and my mouth to go dry, they LIT UP in the matter of a second, all different colors that actually illuminated my bedroom, and then silently disappeared into nothingness.  i am a firm believer in aliens, and had, until now, never experienced anything like this.;39.9301;-74.2053
