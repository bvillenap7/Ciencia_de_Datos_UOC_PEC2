First I noticed red star in SW, placed star finding app with phone on it - there was no identification.  while watching 20 minutes later a bright ball of light appeared below red star and split into two other balls of light that moved into positions above and below red star. then 5 other lights flickered on to the right in a bow shape.  one of the 5 slowly moved away leaving 4. they stayed there for at least an hour, when I went inside to check internet for reports and went back outside they were gone.  My wife did not see the ball of light separate into 2, but after I got her attention she saw the other stars moving into position and flickering on.;39.9301;-74.2053
