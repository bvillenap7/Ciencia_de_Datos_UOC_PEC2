Trianguliar shaped craft, silently land set it self down;2003-02-08 21:15:00;30 seconds;Trianguliar shaped craft, silently land set it self down Me and my friend were walking outside,and we look up and we see what we thought was a plane.So we didn't think much of it. So we went on the oppisite sides of the street to test how far my walky talkeys can strech. I look up back at the sky and the lights re-apper,they are very close to me, and I see Three lights in a triangler type shape. And I can describe how I saw the shape of the craft because it was the same color of the night. At this point I am extatic i start running towards my friend screaming. Tell him to look at the object we see it start to desend what I believe was about a 1/2 mile away towards abandon property. It hoverd down unlike a plan. Also the Craft was Silent.;40.7296;-74.3901
Triangular Pod Craft over New Providence;2021-05-19 12:25:00;7 minutes;Triangular Pod Craft over New Providence A triangular-shaped object, like 3 pods together (like 3 oranges on a plate, all touching) was seen in the Watchung Valley over New Providence. The craft moved vertically, up and down, higher and lower in altitude, hovering, then moving. It had colored lights, like aurora boralis, changing color from red and green, to blue and orange, to green and yellow. It was NOT a plane. I watched from one window, then moved to another to track it. I live very high on a ridge near River Road, able to see 180' of the sky, and I know the flight path for planes, and this was not in the flight path. I thought it could be a helicopter going to Morristown Medical, but it hovered and lifted and never moved towards the hospital, like it would if it was emergency air lift.  As I watched it, I waited for it to move like a regular plane or something, to act in an expected way. But it didnt'. It just lifted and lowered and changed colors, and then appeared to be sucked up into a ver! y dense cloud and disappeared.;40.7296;-74.3901
