Reddish/orange orb moving at steady speed across;2012-05-12 23:00:00;8 minutes;Reddish/orange orb moving at steady speed across My friend and I were hanging out outside quick check in Madison, NJ, when he spotted what looks like a fireball.  I have seen flares before and this was close to the color red/ orange glowing color.   At first i though that was a flare, but this fireball was moving across the sky at steady speed for more then 8 minutes and then it was gone!  This object was like a glowing ball, it looked a lot like the sun with the orange ray coming out the the object.   My friend and I only saw one object but from what we can tell it was defiantly  not a plane either and also it was at a very high altitude.   i have 2 pics of it but they are a bit shaky and a video if you would like me to submit them.;40.7296;-74.3901
