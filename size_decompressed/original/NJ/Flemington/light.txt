Bright Orange lights over Hunterdon and Mercer Counties.;2013-12-31 22:50:00;10 minutes;Bright Orange lights over Hunterdon and Mercer Counties. Watched a craft with a bright orange light and two red blinking lights depart the area of Trenton, NJ at a very rapid speed.  Been watching planes fly in this area for 15 years, never seen a aircraft fly so fast.  Then when it reached the area of Hillsborugh and East Amwell Township the orange light slowed and stopped.  Then for the next 8 minutes the craft just stood still, or flying in tight circles.  Thought it could be a helicopter, but went outside there was no sound.  Should of heard some aircraft engine sound.  Then it was gone.  Searched the night sky with a binocular, but did not see anything.  First time I ever saw an aircraft not with a bright white light, but a bright ORANGE light.  It flew so fast to get this spot over the Sourland mountains only to hover, then poof it was gone.  There were other aircraft in the night sky in the distant.;40.518;-74.8453
Red light that moved back and forth, hovering each time it stopped before moving back again.;2020-06-01 21:00:00;5 minutes;Red light that moved back and forth, hovering each time it stopped before moving back again. It was a clear night. My son and I saw a red light that was not moving very fast and seemed to stop and hover, then go back in the other direction and stop and hover again. I thought it was very strange and maybe a helicopter because I had no other explanation. The red light did not blink like an aircraft nor did it move like any aircraft I had ever seen. It continued to hover in 1 spot and we decided to go in our home dismissing it as an aircraft we had never seen.;40.518;-74.8453
