slow moving red and white lights;2011-11-05 19:15:00;2 min;slow moving red and white lights Hi me and my wife were taking a walk around 7:15 we were by Reaville rd and i look off to my right and saw two red lights close to each other with a white light in the center.  The lights were binking slowly not like the FFA lights on a plane.   As i was watching it the lights were at about a 45 degree angel and it stayed like that for about 15sec then it leveled out and flew strait.  it was low if i had to say a hight it was about 500 ft but lower then 1000ft.   As me and my wife were watching it the flight path it took was a slow turn to the right towards Hillsborough. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be sincere and serious-minded in his description of the event.  PD));40.518;-74.8453
