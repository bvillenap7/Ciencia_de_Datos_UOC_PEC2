PD));2006-10-01 12:00:00;don't know;A plane shaped object that was silver with a yelow emblum and flying low to the ground. It was a plane like object.  It was shaped like an oragami bird.  The back of the plane had a tale that bent down and the wings bent down and out as well.  The front was like a normal plane but more curved than pointed.  It was silver and had a yellow emblum in the bottom corner in the back of the plane.  The emblum did not have words it was more of a scribbling.  It had no windows.  It was about 100ft off the ground and it was flying at that level for a long time.  There are no close  It did not go higher.  I am not sure of the length or height of the plane but it was very close to the ground so what i saw was big. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));40.518;-74.8453
