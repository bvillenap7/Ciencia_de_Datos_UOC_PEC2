Two bright orange glowing objects to the south. First thought it was a helicopter considering it was near an airfield but was extremely bright for being so far away.  The objects were motionless when lit but the light would flicker out then reappear at different altitudes.  They seemed to leapfrog across one another and would even rise and lower in altitude.  The orange glow was small but so bright it was hard to look at. I work at an airfield and have never seen any aircraft with such bright lights and have never seen aircraft move in this motion.;40.0291;-74.3281
