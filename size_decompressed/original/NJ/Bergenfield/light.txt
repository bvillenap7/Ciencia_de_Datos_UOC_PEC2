Once again I was outside with my telescope and once again what I saw came from the constellation Perseus, only this time heading East. At first I thought it was a meteor, but when it came to a sudden stop and didnt disappear, I got chills. It was a ball of light that slightly changed color 1 time from a mild red to yellow. It sped up, slowed down, and changed direction several times. It was a bit larger than a star and it was circular in shape. I opened my deck door to try and get my mom and dad to come out and see it but they didn't get out fast enough. The object stopped and disappeared within 10 degrees of Saturn which is currently in Gemini.;40.9238;-73.9989
Star like UFO.;2014-03-31 02:00:00;30 minutes;Star like UFO. My mother was sleeping and looking out the window when she called me over to see the craft. I hurried over, and there we saw a star like UFO very still for a couple of minutes, and then it would zap right and left, left to right, bottom to top, and then it would be still again.  It was still for a couple of minutes, mimicking a star, and then it zapped away within seconds.  Impossible speed for a human aircraft.  Not a flashlight or laser because the light was small and not connected to a beam at all.  The funny thing was that our phones and cell phones did not have service at all while this UFO was in the air.;40.9238;-73.9989
