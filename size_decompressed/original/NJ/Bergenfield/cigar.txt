I saw a black space cover my bedroom window. It slowly moved away turning silver.   I ran outside the house and observed a large bright cylindrical object about 200 feet in the air approximately the length of one block.   There was no sound of a motor.  It was not moving & no sound of a motor, completely silent.   I sat down on my stoop and watched it for about twenty minutes. It never moved.   About twenty minutes later it moved about 50 feet and stopped.  I stood up and observed there were small red, blue, green lights forming on the horizon.  When the lights became a circle, the cylinder flew into it with enormous speed and disappeared.  I swear this is the truth.
