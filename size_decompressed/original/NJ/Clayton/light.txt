soft pale peach light ascended slowly controlled from 68 degrees near ursa major and SHOT OFF vanished out of sight like shooting star!;2011-04-14 23:37:00;5 seconds;soft pale peach light ascended slowly controlled from 68 degrees near ursa major and SHOT OFF vanished out of sight like shooting star! Something compelling like a gravity pull kinda how the feeling in my legs is I get when a storm comes in... Something told me to go outside for about an hour now... so when I laid the baby down to sleep mommy stayed with and I went to take the trash out...  I was just simply taking the trash out threw it away turned around and looked up a beautiful clear night sky tonight.  I was refreshed being outside as I stared into the still sky when suddenly what first seemed like a star began to travel vertical slooooow in the sky around 68 degrees up horizon toward ursa major  (I know a lil bout constellations) ...!  it was a soft peach light. it ascended for what seemed about 4 seconds and 18 degrees in my line of sight. surged possible a lil brighter just before it swwwwosh !  took off in a second! like a shooting star right to left!!!!!!!  it had to be 25 degrees lateral in my sky view...  the distance it tailed/ streaked was akin to a shooting star and I would had dismissed it like a meteor show except for that I witnessed before that portion of the experience...  the vertical slow controlled ascension then to veer like it did is unexplainable to me growing up an GE hornet aircraft engineer's son.  I still have goose bumps ! Im wired I cant sleep now...  I had to report!;39.6585;-75.0974

Early December,  I was traveling down fries mill road going towards Clayton, and around 10:50-11 I seen a bright white dot traveling the same direction as me (was just about tree line.. It was flying super fast, had no tail and no mechanical sounds).  Never seen something travel so fast.  There one second and gone the other.;39.6585;-75.0974
