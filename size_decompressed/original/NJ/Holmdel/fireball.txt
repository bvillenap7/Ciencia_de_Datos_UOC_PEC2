High speed  blue white streak across the sky traveling at low attitude:streak appeared solid, then tailed off.;2003-04-01 01:00:00;1 second;High speed  blue white streak across the sky traveling at low attitude:streak appeared solid, then tailed off. Driving north on the Garden State Parkway on an overcast night, I looked to the left, the was a streak across the sky, blue white, solid at first then tailed off. I first thought it to be a shooting star, but realized it was too heavy, appeared about 5000 feet in height, traveled about 3 to 5 miles, an estimate. It went into a cloud and lite the cloud up. That justified the approximate height. Rough calculations indicate the streak was moving about 12,000 to 15,000 miles an hour,with no concern about hitting anything. Has anybody seen a similiar object?;40.3846;-74.1754
