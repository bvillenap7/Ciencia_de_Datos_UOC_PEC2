A round, orangish, flickering sphere flew south to north over my location at Church Street & Park Street.  At first I thought it was a small plane or helicopter but it became obvious this was a spherical object which made no sound.  An airplane bisected it's path at a higher altitude and the difference was obvious.  The plane had blinking lights and made noise and I could make out the plane's shape.  Even though the UFO was at a lower altitude I couldn't make out the same detail as I could with the plane.  It was a round flickering orange object moving at approximately the same speed of a plane and made no noise.  I've never seen anything in the sky that prompted me to take a picture before.  It's speed rules out a weather balloon or Chinese lantern.  And it's trajectory rules out a meteor/comet, etc because it flew straight and didn't change altitude as best as I could tell and was steady in its speed. I'm curious if anyone else saw it.  A friend came by and I point! ed it out to him and all he said was &quotwhat the fuck?&quot.  By the time he saw it, it was much further away yet it still appeared odd enough to him to elicit his response even though the detail in which I saw it was no longer visible to him.;40.8183086956522;-74.2112260869564

Object in the sky flying oddly.  I would say it was hover for a bit before it started zooming around.  Very odd.
