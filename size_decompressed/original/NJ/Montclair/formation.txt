Parallel flashing lights sighted in Montclair, New Jersey.;2010-08-28 21:00:00;45 minutes;Parallel flashing lights sighted in Montclair, New Jersey. At first it started as only one flashing light hovering in the sky. The colors changed from green to white, and 10 minutes later from red to white. It was hovering in a figure eight pattern horizontally. Then a second appeared beside it (occurring in the north east sky) moving in sync with the first flashing light. The color pattern of the second flashing light, which was blue and white, seemed to respond to the first flashing light, as they both moved in a figure eight pattern. It is possible that the lights were moving north-east, yet we are accounting for the earths rotation and duration of time, that they were stationary. We have located Venus and Polaris so we know it is not a known celestial body. We have now lost sight of these objects and do not know if they have disappeared.
