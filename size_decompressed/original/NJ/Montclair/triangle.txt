Triangular aircraft flying low over New Jersey (NYC suburbs);2015-03-08 23:15:00;15-30 seconds;Triangular aircraft flying low over New Jersey (NYC suburbs) My fiance and I were watching a television show that started last night, March 8, 2015, at 11:00 PM.  Sometime around 11:15-11:30PM, while sitting on the couch watching the show, I saw something outside the window to my right.  Immediately upon looking at it I realized that I had never seen something like that in my life.  It was an aircraft, perfectly triangular in shape, with all sides straight lines, with a light in each corner, flying very low and relatively slow over my town which is approximately 10 miles from NYC.  The aircraft was heading east towards the city. I jumped up onto the other couch to get a better look out the window.  The aircraft appeared to be flying at a very low altitude, but probably still over 1,000 feet in the air (maybe even quite a bit more) and was low/large enough for me to see the craft itself, not just the lights.  I remember seeing some of the detail of the craft but immediately after seeing it I had a hard time remember the little details like what color the lights were, etc..  I believe, but am not certain, that at least one of the lights was red, and at least one of the lights was white.  If I remember correctly, two of the lights were the same color and one was a different color. I called for my fiance who jumped up onto the couch with me.  While she saw the aircraft and confirm that it was indeed a flying object that I witnessed, by the time she saw it it was far enough away that all that could be seen were the lights.;40.8183086956522;-74.2112260869564
