One Silver object with a big oval center and two smaller ones attached to it.;2012-09-09 11:30:00;10 minutes;One Silver object with a big oval center and two smaller ones attached to it. I saw and photographed and object that was “motionless” (stationary) up in the sky.  The object appeared to be made of metal in nature. It was a bit above the clouds.  Also, it was silver with a big oval center and two smaller parts attached to it, one on top and one below.  The object was so “clean” that it reflected the sun like a mirror.  It looked like it just came out of a “chrome shop”. I took many pictures which I am willing to share.  I used a 300mm lens and after looking at the pictures is when I realized that it had three components.  It left (disappeared) by slowly going up into the sky. It was amazing.;40.8183086956522;-74.2112260869564
