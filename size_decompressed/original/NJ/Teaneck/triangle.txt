After taking notice, the craft shot a beam of light mid-air. The light took on a shape that resembled greatly a Coptic symbol. Stunned. We quickly ran to the deck for better observation. This craft hovered quickly and reached us almost instantly. It was triangular in shape and possessed fascinating features. Center bottom was a bowl-like structure filled with glowing orange, green, and white lights. The same colors were also ringing at each corner. Must have been at least 100 feet wide.;40.8949;-74.0110000000003
