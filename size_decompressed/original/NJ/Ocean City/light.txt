Lights in sky on July 4th.  ((Starlink satellites???));2021-07-04 17:00:00;.5 hour;Lights in sky on July 4th Watching fireworks on the Ocean City, NJ beach around 9pm. As fireworks started there was a small bright light traveling south. I thought was a shooting star. Then a minute later another one. Then another, and another. All traveling south. The same distance between each one. Perfectly in the same line of travel.  I pointed it out to my family, which they saw as well. Including my 12 & 10 year olds saw them.  My husband said they could be satellites? Was fascinating to watch. No blinking to be an airplane, and traveling fast.;39.2733;-74.5876
