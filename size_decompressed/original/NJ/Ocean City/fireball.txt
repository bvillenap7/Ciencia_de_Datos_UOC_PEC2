Sitting on my balcony I saw one bright light moving slowly across the sky, another followed behind.  Another appeared soon after and the lights seemed to make a triangular formation.  The lights slowly, one after the other, grew smaller and vanished faintly until they had all disappeared completely .;39.2733;-74.5876
