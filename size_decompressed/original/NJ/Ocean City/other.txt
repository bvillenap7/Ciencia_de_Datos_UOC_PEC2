Four blinking lights formed a Vin the sky.;2012-12-06 18:45:00;5 minutes;Four blinking lights formed a &quotV&quot in the sky. As a UFO enthusiast and amateur researcher, the recent sightings in our area have proved puzzling. This particular evening produced a phenomena that neither I nor my passenger could  explain.  While stopped at an intersection, I glanced at the sky and noticed four white blinking lights in the form of a V.  At first, I dismissed them as airplanes, but upon further inspection noticed that they were changing formation and did not produce any audible sound.  My passenger instructed me to pull over, and I suggested we attempt to record a video on her cellular phone as evidence.   However, the objects did not show well on the video, likely due to the abundance of street lamps overhead. Soon after, a passenger plane appeared to pass below the objects.  This is when the story grew to be especially peculiar.  For the rest of the evening, my family and I heard military jets and helicopters hovering through the area, appearing to be searching for something.  This i! s unusual, as we live in a small seashore town with very little activity this time of year.;39.2733;-74.5876
