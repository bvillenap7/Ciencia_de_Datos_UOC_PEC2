BLIMP SHAPED OBJECT IN THE SKY.;2008-08-17 10:30:00;15 MINUTES;BLIMP SHAPPED OBJECT IN THE SKY. I was on my way to Cape May,NJ with my wife and 2 sons,and while driving on NJ-42 south,I spotted something in the distant sky that looked like a blimp.The more we drove,the more we watched as this blimp hovered and arose and descended in the sky.It seemed to get closer at times but then would go below the tree line and once we saw it again,it was very far in the distant sky again. You could see as this thing moved up and down that it was moving slowly,but every time we lost in behind tree's,it would appear again very very far away. We could see that this was definitely not a plane or helicopter and there was no way a blimp could get so far away from us so quickly as we were doing about 75mph.It was a blueish colored object that at times would look more round,but over all looked like a blimp. We followed it for at least 15 minutes until we turned off on to the Garden State Parkway and then lost it. My wife and I were trying to really figure out what this was and were actually joking at first with our kids that it was a UFO.The joking soon turned to puzzlement as we could not,and still cannot determine what it was. Just wondering if anyone else in the NJ area spotted this?;39.2733;-74.5876
