All I remember is waking up to the cold night. Instead of being in my bed I'm lying on some type of table with blurry life forms circled around me. My vision gradually became clearer and finally I saw them...thin, tall, grey aliens all staring at me with their big eyes. One of them (the tallest and possibly the leader) reaches for a scalpal knife and walks towards me. By this time I'm starting to panic. However, another alien tried to calm me down. Strangely, a feeling of tranquility came over me and I fell into a deep sleep. Before long it was morning and I was returned to my bedroom. People think I'm crazy because I am my only witness. Maybe someone who reads this will think differently. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.909905;-74.555025
