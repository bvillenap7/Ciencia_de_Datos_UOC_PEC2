07/15/1975  Dover,NJ Apprx 12 boomerang shape disks w/red center light hovering 2 hrs.1 larger than others.02/25/05;1975-07-15 22:00:00;2 hours at least;07/15/1975  Dover,NJ Apprx 12 boomerang shape disks w/red center light hovering 2 hrs.1 larger than others.02/25/05 On a summer evening in mid-July 1975,my boyfriend and I were saying good night in Wharton,NJ. We both observed several boomerang shaped disks with a red light in the center.One was larger than the rest.They were all hovering and the smaller ones would move only if the large one moved first.They would follow it quickly in a haphazard manner, kind of jutting around in the sky until they would stop and hover near the large craft.  We agreed that he would call the Wharton police and I would go home and call the Dover police.I could see the objects all the way home to my house and was fearful as I knew these were UFOs.I went in and told my parents then called the Dover police.They laughed at me and hung up the phone.The Wharton police also laughed at my friend and did nothing. My mother, father,and I stood at the top of a hill in our back yard and watched these spacecrafts for at least 2 hours.  We got tired and went to bed.I have been hesitant to tell anyone this story because my family and close friends never did believe me and still tease me about it to this day.I would guess there were about one dozen of these boomerang shaped crafts.All had a red light in the center and although it was dark,appeared to be solid gray or black.They appeared to be hovering over the town of Dover as we faced them and watched intently for so long.Once the police laughed at me,what was I to do?Who else could I call?It feels so good to finally tell my story to someone who doesn't think I'm crazy.I know what I saw.Thanks for listening.
