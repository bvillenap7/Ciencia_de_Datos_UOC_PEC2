Unknown sizable bright objects flying in circles.;2014-06-05 23:30:00;10 minutes;Unknown sizable bright objects flying in circles. It started with one unknown sizable bright object flying in circles through the clouds with wings that flapped like a bird.   However, the path was not consistent as the formation of the circles changed.   After 3-4 minutes as second joined in and the two chased one another in play.   Definitely not a light show as far as I could tell as I've never seen anything like it before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
