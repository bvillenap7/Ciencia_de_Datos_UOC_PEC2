Large orange glowing fireball.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a Chinese lantern, flying overhead??  PD));2016-04-17 22:30:00;5 minutes;Large orange glowing fireball. Hi I'm from New Jersey and my friend and I were at the park tonight next to Camden County College in Blackwood, NJ, at around 10:30pm and we witness what we believe to be a UFO. As we were walking I noticed this huge glowing orange ball coming from behind the trees, and I said to my friend do you see that at first I thought it was a REALLY REALLY big floating lantern until it floated over out in front of us and we saw fire coming from it, I mean it was so close to us that we could see the flames as it floated, it was like a HUGE orange glowing ball with fire coming from it. Then it just stopped in mid air for about 4 or 5 seconds like it was staring back at us, then it proceeded to float.  What was crazy is that it was so close we could actually see the flames on it but there was no heat coming down on us, and as close as it seemed I thought we should have felt some heat, there was no sound nor was it smoke or a smoke trail. We were so in aww on top of being scared of what we were seeing that we didn't record it and then we when did start recording it was gone!  Never in my life would I have thought I would have witness seeing a UFO!  It was 1 other person in the park tonight and I can't help but wonder if he seen it or if anyone that wasn't it the park seen it from a distance!!   All I know is what we saw was truly unexplainable!;39.7896999999999;-75.0355
