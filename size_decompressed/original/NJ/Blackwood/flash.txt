My daughter & I were in my car passing by Timber Creek Park, when we saw a green flash of light speed through the night sky.  It took place to the right side of us, way up in the sky, over the park trees. It lasted for about 4 seconds.  The flash of light apeared out of no where, zoomed through the sky & disappeared completely. It didn't keep going like a plane or shooting star would, that's why we came to the conclusion that it must of been a UFO.;39.7896999999999;-75.0355

I first noticed it outside my window, then, terrified, I went to my window and saw it appear then disappear.   I am truly scared.  I went and got my bf to come watch with me.  He thought I was nutz, until he saw it too!   It wasn't the first time I saw a ufo.  I seen a triangle red lighted one before about a year ago.   But this particular one put fear in my heart.  I don't think I'll be sleeping tonite.   In the last flash I saw it change from blue to purple.  It was very big in size and appeared to be very close.  It was right over the lake above the trees.
