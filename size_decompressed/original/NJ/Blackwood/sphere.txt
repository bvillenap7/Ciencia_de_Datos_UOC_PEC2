A bright white sphere moving slowing across the day sky.;2013-09-17 14:00:00;10-15 seconds;A bright white sphere moving slowing across the day sky. I was outside it was a clear blue sky with no clouds. I was looking up at a large bird flying high in the sky.  I observed a bright white sphere moving across the sky.  It didn't make a sound but was moving steady accross the day sky from south to north.  It then just disappeared.
