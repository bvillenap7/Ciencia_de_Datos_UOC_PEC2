Red light floating in sky at night in park.;2016-07-13 01:00:00;10  minutes;Red light floating in sky at night in park. The UFO was at first a little orange quarter moon crest shape.  At first I thought it was the moon but, Then started to turn into an odd round shape.  I was about 80-100 yards away and it was late at night.  I was in a well open area of a park.   The orange round thing turned to a almost blood red color.  It was just floating in the air maybe about 120 feet from the ground. It staid still but looked like a red blob changing shape but staid relatively round.  I took a picture knowing my wife or anyone for that matter wouldn't really believe me.   At that point it had bin there for 8-9 minutes, and I started to walk closer to see what this thing was. As I got to around 50 yards from it it started to get smaller witch I thought was odd because I was closer now.  I stoped and saw it get smaller and smaller until it was a little red dot and then just disappeared. It didn't fly up into the sky and it didn't look like it was moving in any direction it just got sma! ller until there was nothing left.  I walk over to where I thought it was and there was no sign of anything, no people, nothing strange, no animals or bugs just quiet.   I called my wife as I walked home and told her what I saw she said it was probably a drone, I told her that it  definitely was not a drone and once she saw the picture she agreed it was no drone.;39.7896999999999;-75.0355
