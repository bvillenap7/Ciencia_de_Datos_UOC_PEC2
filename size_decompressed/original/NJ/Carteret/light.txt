Massive NJ sighting;2001-07-15 00:30:00;20 min;Massive NJ sighting I was not a personal witness to the event, however I am an active UFO researcher and field investigator. Since I live very close to the area, I will be personally doing a field investigation for a small UfoAmerica.iwarp.com. Several thousand others were witness to this event, as vehicles on surrounding roadways were reportedly pulling off to the shoulder faster than you could imagine. There were about 15, maybe as many as 20 glowing orange orbs, high in the sky above Caretet New Jersey. The event was reported on all the local NJ/NYC news channels including Fox-5, NBC-4, WB-11, NJ-12, and is totally unexplained. The orbs moved about, changing various formations. People said they saw everything from a circle, to the big dipper. The UFOs were just floating there in the sky, moving about each other and taking various formations. Carteret NJ police were notified by several callers. So far there has been no radar confirmation, and it appears that the military was not involved. The only alternative explanation at this point, are unlawful sky divers with illumination flares. However, the length of the event seems to rule that out. There are at least two known videos. The UFOs themselves were of the string of pearls variety. The same type have been caught on tape before. Once in the US in the 50s I beleive, and the other in Mexico more recently. This seems to be a very good sighting with many people as witnesses. I will be going door to door today asking witnesses to tell their story in the area. I'm hoping that by posting it on the Internet everywhere, more people will come forward. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time of the event here.  PD));40.5787;-74.2292

There were at least 15 calls to authorities and as many as 75 cars pulled over on the New Jersey Turnpike to view it. One witness described it as lights the size of volleyballs dwarfing the surrounding stars, and clearly moved in formation. No explanation could be given by authorities as to what it was the witnesses saw in the sky. I did not witness the sighting, but read the article in the newspaper the next morning.;40.5787;-74.2292
