Possible UFO in area with a history of reported UFO sightings;2012-03-09 05:30:00;approx. 5-10 seconds;Possible UFO in area with a history of reported UFO sightings At around 05:30 AM, first light of dawn on March 9, 2012, the UFO appeared briefly in my view for approximately 5 seconds in close distance over a swamp approximately a thousand feet or less off the ground. The UFO had a chevron shape, much like a USAF B-2 bomber but was much larger.  It had a grey metallic/ charcoal color with a series of three white lights, one in the center and two on the “wing” tips. It made no noise.  Had the craft been an aircraft, military or commercial it would have made some sound but I could hear nothing.   This sighting occurred in a secured, non-military, government regulated highly sensitive area.  I am an employee in this such area.  As the UFO appeared to me in between two large structures I viewed it while driving by along a road.  By the time I stopped the vehicle and reversed to take a second look the UFO had vanished with no trace or sound.   I attempted to debunk the sighting by looking around the area to see if it could have been! a light stanchion, large crane or some other object but my search came up empty. No physical structures existed in LOS or in the adjacent area to the UFO. I have not seen the UFO since.;40.5787;-74.2292
