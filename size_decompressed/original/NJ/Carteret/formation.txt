I'm surprised I don't see this on your site yet but in New Jersey over the weekend there was a MAJOR UFO sighting (with MAJOR news coverage and video footage) that was eerily similar to the Ramstein AFB sighting and the Phoenix sightings.  Partial V-Type formations hovering, with lights fading out one by one.   Here's a link to a newsite that also has a RealVideo link to the amateur video:  http://((deleted))_njufos.html    I did not see this (I live in NYC) but I saw all the news reports.  The link above has the names (and interviews) some of the witnesses.;40.5787;-74.2292

As reported in 7/16/01 Newark Star Ledger: 75 cars pulled over on NJ Turnpike to view slow moving, bright yellow V-formation of bright lights which dwarf the stars. 15 callers to police reporting strange orange flares.  Witnesses include police officers in Carteret.  police contacted Newark airport and McGuire AF base, but they had no explanation.;40.5787;-74.2292
moving light formation;2001-07-15 00:30:00;UNKNOWN;moving light formation I Saw this report on the news and they had footage from what seemed to be their camera, as it was VERY clear and no blurring or shaking as you would expect from an amateur camera. The reports researched from the airports for no flights or radar contacts in that area would be correct as this object seemed to be outside the atmosphere possibly in orbit or just passing by.  The reason for my perspective of being outside the atmosphere is because there was an ice haze in the video much like you would see if looking at the moon and seeing ice rings. ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports from the area of Carteret for this date.  Please see other reports.  PD));40.5787;-74.2292
