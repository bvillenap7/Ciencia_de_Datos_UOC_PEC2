I stopped to looked at, and lost it behind the trees. Saw a football shaped object in sky that was luminescent all the way through (no shadows).  It moved at a steady pace from what looked like SSE to NNW direction.  It had flashing red, blue, and white lights on top and bottom of the shape.;40.266;-74.5217
