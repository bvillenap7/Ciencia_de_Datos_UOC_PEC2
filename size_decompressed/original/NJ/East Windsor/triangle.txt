No other color lights like an airplane (red and green on wingtips). Definitely not an airplane.  I was heading south on Route 539, just past the turnpike overpass. Low flying craft heading in a east/northeast direction. No sound. Moving slowly. Had visual for about 2 minutes, lost it behind trees. Spotted it again over sod fields in Washington/Allentown. Craft then vanished in the middle of the sky. No clouds or trees to obscure it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));40.266;-74.5217
