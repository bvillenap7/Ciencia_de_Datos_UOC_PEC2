Object slowly entered viewing area right before midnight, roughly 25 feet above tree line. Hovered in place while slightly drifting about multiple axis'.  Stayed in place for roughly 10 minutes before heading northeast from our location.  Within minutes, 5 fighter jets were seen heading in the direction the object went, one after the other, roughly 15 seconds apart. Object was too quite to have been powered by a turbine combustion engine of any kind, tree tops(pine) only slightly moved around, nowhere near enough to reflect adequate downdraft from any kind of propellers to keep the object hovering.  It was roughly 30' by 15', no lights or distinct edges.  Bottom appeared to be semi-spherical.  Only audible noise was that of a hydraulic whine, maybe 40-50 decibels.  A distinct smell followed, similar to welding gas, possibly some sort of ionization.;40.0707;-74.5069
