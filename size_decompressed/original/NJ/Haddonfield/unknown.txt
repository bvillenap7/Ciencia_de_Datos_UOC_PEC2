At first I just thought it was an airplane, but it was way too close to the barrier.  Had bright red and green lights on the underside.  I saw it for a few seconds and then it was like it just disappeared.  Iâ€™ve never seen anything like that from just an airplane!  And then when I arrived home, I heard strange sounds in the air.  Really freaked me out.;39.8952;-75.0347
