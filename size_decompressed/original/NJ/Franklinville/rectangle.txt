Daytime sighting of white rectangle shaped object flying in clouds highly reflective surface.;2016-07-31 16:20:00;10 seconds;daytime sighting of white rectangle shaped object flying in clouds highly reflective surface. while driving on RT 55 Northbound in the Elmer-Franklinville area I was able to see a very shinny white rectangle flying low and very fast through the cloud layers.  Due to the trees and the flight direction, i lost sight of the object very quickly.  But it was flying east to west in a low arc though the clouds, and what caught my eye was the reflection by the sun on its surface which created a flash effect.   I managed to witness it for no more than 10 seconds and then it was either gone or within the cloud bank.   The clouds where very think and the sun was very bright.;39.6156;-75.0409
