Low Flying Triangle Shaped Craft seen over Franklinville/Malaga Area.;2010-11-07 20:35:00;1-2 minutes;Low Flying Triangle Shaped Craft seen over Franklinville / Malaga Area On November 7th, 2010 at 8:35pm, I had a very close encounter with an unidentifiable craft.  I had just left for work and as I proceeded down the road about 1/4 of a mile from my house I could see bright lights through the trees to my right.  I live in a very rural area with a lot of trees.  I thought nothing of this since there are a lot of small private airports near my house and I always see small planes in this area but not usually right over the trees or near the high tension lines.  As I approached the clearing where the high tension towers are I saw a giant craft approaching.  At first I thought it was a military cargo plane that was on the wrong flight path and way too low.  It was at least fifty feet wide and had five bright lights across the front but no strobes.  As it got closer I could see that it was no plane.  I stopped my van and got my cellphone and frantically tried to get it into camera mode as it approached to no avail.  It passed directly over my head at approximately 100 feet from ground level.  This was easy to measure since it was up twice as high as the high tension towers.  It made a very low rumbling sound but not at all like a military cargo plane.  I know what they look and sound like as they pass overhead as I have done work at the FAA in A.C. and at McGuire Air force base.  I could clearly see an aqua/blue colored light in the very center underneath the craft.  It was pulsing slowly but again, no strobes.  And I could also clearly see that it was in the shape of a triangle not a plane.  It glided slowly away following the high tension lines. It was see by another person who was driving on route 55.  They reported it to Mufon.;39.6156;-75.0409
