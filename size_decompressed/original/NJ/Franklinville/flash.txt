It look like it might have been maybe 50 ft or so above the ground and a half a mile away heading towards us, then the next big flash of light was about maybe 100 ft ahead of us and changed position to the side of are vehicle,send the third bright flashing light was probably 50 ft on the side of our vehicle about 25 to 30 feet high. That's when my son saw a blackout shapes that he could not describe after the light went out, after that it was behind us and then we never saw the light again. I drive that road everyday. There were no trees because it was where a corn field is it didn't make any sound at all what the light was very bright and big. There are new towers around if it was a drone there's no way it could flash a light that free plus I probably would have heard it ! and it was a plain I definitely would have heard it and I can't see a plane flashing a bright light and having no other lights that low and coming out us at that speed.  That's all I can really say about it.  When it passed us it flashed once more and we didn't see it again. and we don't know what it was or what it could be we talked it over and you can't come up with any explanation.  He's very strange and neither of us ever saw anything like it.  What was really confusing is that it didn't make any sounds and it was coming out of so fast and then just disappeared after I passed us, this helps you I hope so otherwise that's it that's what we saw;39.6156;-75.0409
