Three red lights seen from Lake Hopatcong, NJ on january 26;2009-01-26 20:30:00;10-15 minutes;Three red lights seen from Lake Hopatcong, NJ on january 26 Three of us were walking accross Lake Hopatcong on the evening of Monday, January 26.  Around 8:30 pm I looked up to the sky from the center of the lake, over the area of Mt. Arlington, and saw 3 red blinking lights in the sky.  It was in the eastern direction.   The 3 red lights were in the shape of a triangle, blinking, and stationary.  The blinked for about 10-15 minutes then disappeared.  At first I thought it was a light tower, but it was much to high, especially compared to the tower we could see in the same area.  Not planes either, as the airport has a holding pattern over the lake and we could see several airplanes flying in the same direction, in comparison just didn't look like an airplane.  We tried to take pictures with our camera phones, but the cameras were not good enough to capture what we saw;40.9564;-74.6246
Low flying bright light that stayed for about 15-20 minutes then picked up speed and disappeared;2019-06-24 03:15:00;20 minutes;Low flying bright light that stayed for about 15-20 minutes then picked up speed and disappeared Beautiful clear night observing sky during a period or not sleeping.  Noticed a “star” in the sky I thought that was moving- downloaded a sky app and noticed it WAS moving and not coming up on the app.  It then had a bright white light and moving in very slow but unsteady patterns, lower to the ground.  After about 15-20 minutes it started moving faster and truly disappeared/light was off (gone).;40.9564;-74.6246
