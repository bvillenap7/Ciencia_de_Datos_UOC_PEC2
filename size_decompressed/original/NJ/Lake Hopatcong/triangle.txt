My fiance and I observed a tringular shaped object traveling west, then hovering at about 2000 feet above the lake, making a loud helicopter noise. The triangular shape was more specifically like a science model of a molecule, approximately 20-30 feet high and 20-30 feet wide. It had a star of many points at the center (nucleus region)which was blinking white and red light. It had an extremely bright and flashing light above this center, and two bright lights below at a 90 degree separation. The craft was moving slowly, almost hovering for a moment, then it ascended and seemed to retract the outer lights and continue in a slow westerly direction. Further north, we observed another craft, shaped more like a plane, but the sharply pointed bulk head was all white light and there were too many flashing red and white lights for it to be a plane. The exact shape of the body of both objects, which presumably connected these lights, was too dark to ascertain. Both objects flew too low to the ground to be regulated aircraft and flew at a very slow rate.  The rumbling of the triangular shaped object was intense.;40.9564;-74.6246
