Fighter Jets chasing UFO across New Jersey;2004-07-07 15:00:00;60 seconds;Fighter Jets chasing UFO across New Jersey While doing a delivery to a location in Clementon I happend to look up and saw a Jet contrail, then another and another.  I saw they were all interseting.   I followed to the Jets and saw that the lead jet has something in front of it.  The jets were relatively low and saw there were 4 of them.  The thing in front of the lead jet was light pink in color and was in an almost hour glass shape.  At this point I ran into the building to get someone else out side to see it and when I had come back I saw the jet going behind clouds.  By time I could make out the jet again it was to small to see any thing other then the contrail. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Pink object chased by jet fighters over New Jersey.;2005-10-17 16:00:00;30 seconds;Pink object chased by jet fighters over New Jersey. I just spent a good deal of time checking other listings on this site. I saw that others saw this craft being chased by jet aircrafts and figured this was the day of the occurance. I will re-tell. I was doing a delivery at a resturant in New Jersey. I was on the side of the building at the loading dock. It was a warm fall day with a lot of puffy white clouds in the sky. I was taking a smoke brake and happend to look up in the sky, it was a lovey day. I saw to the east quite a few forming contrails from jet fighters. This was not uncommon on the east coast and evan more so since 9/11/2001. At first I saw three contrails all heading in the same direction coming closer to each other, then a 4th. then a 5th, and I noticed the plains making them. they were much lower then normal. they all seemed to be convirging. I them followed them to the point they would meet and saw the lead fighter jet. It was lower and much closer then the rest. It was almost over head. That is when it got strange. In front of the lead jet was an object. It was a very light pink color. It was as light a pink as the sky was a light blue. If the object were to have shifted color to as light a blue as it was pink you would not see it. With that being said. This object was traveling east to west. The lead fighter jet was right on its tail. There was no exhaust coming from this pink object. There were no visible lights. It seemed more organic then metal. its shape is hard to discribe. It was like an hour glass with it's ends pointed, but the middle was not as narrow as an hour glass. It was flying across the sky and went behind some clouds followed by the lead jet. I waited hoping it would come visible again and then ran into the resturant to find someone, any one to come out and look. This only took seconds. When I returned outside I scanned the sky but the clouds blocked any further sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));39.8013;-75.0030999999999
silver bell shaped object drifting low over Clementon NJ at 10am.;2008-02-02 10:00:00;3 minutes;silver bell shaped object drifting low over Clementon NJ at 10am. 10am, while sitting out on my sunporch looking out at birds, I suddenly saw a bell shaped object drifting very low, slow & soundless, through the sky. Completely clear blue sunny day. It was very close, so I could tell it was bell shape with a silver coating.  I keep my cameras next to me, but by the time my camera was ready to take the pic it had already drifted behind the trees.;39.8013;-75.0030999999999
