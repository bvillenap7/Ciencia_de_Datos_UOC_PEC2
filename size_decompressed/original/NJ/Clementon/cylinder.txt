photo of cylinderical object.;2008-08-29 11:16:00;<1 sec;photo of cylinderical object. I was reviewing photos I had taken over the summer, and noticed an object in one photo. I had seen a program on TV about these same shaped objects. I shot the photo on a Nikon d200 camera in RAW format. I want to know if anyone wants to see this photo. I can copy and send  to whoever wants to see it. The file is very large, and I may need assistance sending it via internet. Here is a copy of the photo.&#65532;39.8013;-75.0030999999999
