Silver sphere comes out of a cloud and shoots upward.;2014-07-15 07:25:00;5 seconds;Silver sphere comes out of a cloud and shoots upward. I was at a lake near my house in new jersey, near Al capon's  summer home (that is my understanding).  I was there for 3 hours, from 4:30 AM to 7:45 AM to get pictures of a sunrise.   Not long before I was ready to leave the area and go home, I saw a small silver sphere fly out of a cloud, it moved up then left very quickly before it shot upward out of my view.  I don't know if it was a UFO as many would or would not call it, but never the less it was very strange.   I've seen more things like it before on camping trips but had always brushed it off as a lack of sleep.  Yet i had gotten a full nights rest before going out to the lake in question. (there was a air liner flying ahead of it just seconds before i had seen said sphere). ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));39.8013;-75.0030999999999
