Multiple strange flying objects.;2015-01-08 00:00:00;20 minutes;multiple strange flying objects I observed from my balcony several objects with green, red and white lights flying across the horizon.  Some would make a u turn suddenly, and some would just disappear after being seen for about 1 minute.   All of them were silent.  They all were different light's and shaped objects its hard to discribe.  one would be four white lights in a square shape, another two lights one light was blinking green.  I seen several craft going in the same direction or hovering in the same part of the sky.  The activity was crazy...I couldn't believe what we were seeing.  I wanted to post this to see if anyone else in the Lindenwold/Clementon, NJ, area also witnessed this.;39.8013;-75.0030999999999
