Now it had lights on its 3 ends, which showed the length and shape. I saw this craft moving slowly towards the north, or following the Delaware river going north as it was a very large craft. I did not get to see a good picture of its body, as it was dark and it made no sound. Other planes or flight traffic in the area made noises of their flight. But this did not. I wish that it was what I saw, I may have seen a blimp as I could not hear a sound from it, and the fact that it had lights at the corners of it made me think about it being man made. Just wanted to report what saw and if any one else had seen it.;40.9695;-74.9777
