Brightly illuminated triangular-shaped light.;2017-09-25 19:30:00;1-2 seconds;Brightly illuminated triangular-shaped light I was looking just to the south of the Northern Cross and saw a distinctive, triangular shaped light brightly flash just once.   It illuminated long enough to realize the direction of travel as south/southwest.  Made no sound.  Did not exhibit the typical red/green/clear strobing lights of typical aircraft.   This is the second time this summer I've seen strange lights in this same area of the night sky.  In all the years I've been looking up, I've seen satellites, 2 comets, run of the mill aircraft, blimps, whatever, but never anything like this.;40.6947;-74.2687999999999
