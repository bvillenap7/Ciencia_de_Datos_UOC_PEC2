U.F.O or a wandering star?;2000-11-01 20:00:00;5-6 min;U.F.O or a wandering star? I work in a chemical plant. So there is no smoking on the property. When break time came, The night shift supervisor and I stepped out side the property gate to have a smoke. Since a kid, I have always dreamed about space. That night the sky was totaly clear. So as I was smoking my cigarette, I was looking up at the stars. I noticed one star more than the others.It looked like it was moving.So I told the night supervisor to look.When he got his eye on it, it was moving. At that time It was moving at a good speed. It looked like maybe it could be a shooting star. Until it stopped moving.Then I knew it had to be something else.So I asked the night shift supervisor what he thought it could be. When he started to answer, It started to move again. We were trying to keep an eye on it, But there were trees soon to be in the way.But that didnt matter. It was like someone turned a switch off. It was gone. What it looked like was a star. It was bright with a little flicker. It was the coolest thing I ever saw. Like I said, It looked like a star at first. But then it started to move. Now, I have seen shooting stars before. This was not a shooting star. Ther was no trail behind it. And as far as i know, shooting stars dont just stop.;40.6947;-74.2687999999999
Bright white light seen trailing through the sky North East of Union, NJ.;2008-08-31 22:00:00;5 seconds;Bright white light seen trailing through the sky North East of Union, NJ. While sitting on my deck observing the sky, an airplane caught my attention flying at medium altitude like it had taken off from JFK or LaGuardia airport in NYC.  The direction was North East from Union, NJ. After looking at the airplane for a few seconds, an extremely bright light appeared at a lower altitude than the plane and then shot off to the left in an arc leaving a slight trail of light behind it. This single point of light was very pure white and much larger in appearence (2 to 3 times its size) than the airplane which is why I assume it was at a lower altitude. I have spent a good deal of time on my deck for the last 10 years and never observed anything like this. I was able to follow the object for approximately 5 seconds and then it disappeared.;40.6947;-74.2687999999999
