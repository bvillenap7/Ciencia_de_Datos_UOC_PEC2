They moved at slow air speed. Each appeared to release what I thought might have been two parachutes. But I saw no person attached to them. Instead, I saw what looked like two tear-dropped, transparent shapes, almost the consistency of a bubble a kid would blow. After a minute, they vanished and the aircraft moved west. Then, from behind a cloud, came three more planes of the same description and they formed a five-across formation and headed west toward Morristown, N.J. Two minutes later, I heard a jet sweep through, but it was hidden behind clouds. But it sounded as if it were in pursuit. Five minutes later, four fighter jets joined the chase.
