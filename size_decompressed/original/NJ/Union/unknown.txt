2 black hovering objects...approx 10k ft high..;1999-09-12 18:30:00;15 minutes;2 black hovering objects...approx 10k ft high.. Cooking on the grill in the yard. Thought I saw a black spot in my eye but after looking again, I ran inside and got my binoculars. I immediately saw clearly  2 objects, at the same height and seperated about 1 inch in my view. They were hovering stationary with a VERY slow movement to the west. From where I live, they were approx at a degree heading of 250deg( just slight north of my Dish which is at 240deg. I observed them, and had my 21 year old son also confirm the sighting with the binoculars. The objects were just barely visable without the 8x50 binos. We were both very convinced what we saw was not something natural.My best guess is that they were somewhere over the Watchung or Scotch Plains NJ towns. We were truly amazed as they 2 objects displayed some kind of unstable motion while hovering. They were clearly not balloons or airplanes. They disappeared into a cloud 15 minutes later. The really weird part is that what appeared to be a military style small jet, with 2 engines on the body between wings and tail appeared and circled the area 2 times and then in the reverse direction. My wife also witnessed the jet and it appeared that they either were observing or trying to locate the 2 objects that we saw.;40.6947;-74.2687999999999

BOUNCING LIGHTS ON THE DRIVEWAY, AND BRIGHT LIGHTS IN THE SKY;2002-12-25 19:15:00;1 minute;BOUNCING LIGHTS ON THE DRIVEWAY, AND BRIGHT LIGHTS IN THE SKY I WAS VISITING MY PARENTS BACK EAST. WE WERE WATCHING TV (MY PARENTS AND I), AND I SAW THROUGH THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW BRIGHT LIGHTS ON OUR DRIVE WAY. IT WAS LIKE BOUNCING, FLICKERING, BLUISH/WHITE FLASHING LIGHTS (NOT IN A CIRCULAR MOTION, BUT UP AND DOWN) . I RAN TO THE WINDOW, AND THEY RAN OUTSIDE. THERE WERE NO CARS OUTSIDE (AS I THOUGHT IT MAY HAVE BEEN POLICE FLASHING LIGHTS). THAN I LOOKED UP IN THE SKY (IT WAS CLOUDY, AND SNOWING), AND THE WHOLE SKY GOT BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER THAN IT STOPPED LIKE IT DESAPPEARED, AND THE SKY BECAME GREENISH/BLUEISH COLOR, AND IT WAS GONE.

Ufos Over NJ/NYC;2012-04-03 10:00:00;2-3 Hours;Ufos Over NJ/NYC I am a amatuer UFO enthusiest, I reported my sightings to MUFON. Only to have them tell me there planes,helicopters,blimps,etc. with no real investigation ever done? I received emails from there head investigator telling me he was an expert..and was even abducted. OK so what do I care!!! This is where it gets strange,in the beginning my pics were all over the net, I use earthcam and wired New York web cams to capture my pictures. Well lately I’ve noticed that the page will never refresh every 30 seconds like it used to and sometimes they block me completely??? Why?, I have no clue. Anyone can use these cams to see these objects, I believe the cameras have infarred view and that’s why I get so many Strange pictures. I am sending my first report to you guys in a hope that you will show my evidence and investigate this matter further..??? If you don’t believe me just watch the cams for yourself and you’ll see…Trust me on that !!!!;40.6947;-74.2687999999999
