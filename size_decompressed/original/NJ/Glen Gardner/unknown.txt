Stat. obj. high in the sky that had rapidly flashing lights - colors were distinct.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Arcturus.  PD));2013-09-30 22:30:00;20 minutes;Stationary object high in the sky that had rapidly flashing lights - colors were distinct - red, green, white and amber. My boyfriend and I were sitting on our front porch looking West, when we noticed an object pretty high up in the sky that was stationary.  It was a dark night, but after looking closely, we could distinctly see flashing lights in the colors of red, green, amber and white.  It once quickly moved straight up into the air, but otherwise remained completely stationary.  The lights flashed intensely and quickly, and the colors could each be made out distinctly.  It was cold, so we decided to go back inside, and did not see it leave the spot in the sky.  I peeked through a window about 15 minutes after we went inside and saw that it was still there, but about an hour later went back outside and there was no sign of it. During that time, we saw approximately 4 airplanes move through the airspace at what seemed like a lower altitude than the object we observed. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Arcturus.  It would be in the western sky, at the time indicated by the witness.  PD));40.717;-74.9146
