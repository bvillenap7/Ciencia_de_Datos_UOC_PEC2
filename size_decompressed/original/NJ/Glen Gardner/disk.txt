First seen while driving south on Rt 31 leaving Washington ,NJ. We saw a disc [bright as moon but whiter] in the sky at about 15 or 20 degrees elevation which my wife an I joked that it could be a ufo but most likely was the moon between two cloud layers.  About 10 minutes later arrived home [mountain top home], my wife got a phone call and I went outside to look for the ufo or moon [It turned out there was no moon or clouds that night]. I saw the ufo at once low on the horizon maybe 10 or 20 miles away and hovering at maybe 1000 ft or less.  I ran inside to get my binoculars [variable 8 to 24 power] and yelled to my wife to hang up the phone and quick come outside.  She could see the ship sparkle with her bare eye and with the binoculars I saw the ship , bright white and sparkling [The moon would have been yellow this near the horizon. I was looking ENE, the moon would have been to my east. My viewing location was 40-40-50 North and 074-57-14  West. The ufo moved around for about 30 minutes or so at low altitude then slowly moved north out of view behind the trees on my mountain!!;40.717;-74.9146
