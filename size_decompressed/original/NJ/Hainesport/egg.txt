Stationary egg shaped light that began moving after 20 minutes, details seen through binoculars.;2019-10-05 18:00:00;25 minutes;Stationary egg shaped light that began moving after 20 minutes, details seen through binoculars. Saw a bright point of light in the southern sky proximal to the moon outside my home.  It was unusual because it was stationary but too close to be a planet.  Planes flew past it.  I have a 1.5 minute video and it is very slowly moving.  When I looked through my binoculars it appeared VERY clearly as a silver egg shape with an extremely bright white  circular light center like a round fluorescent tube.  I watched it about 20-25 minutes and for the last 5 minutes it began moving very slowly and steadily to the East, at which time I had to go inside for an appointment.  My boyfriend also watched this with me and observed it the light through the binoculars.;39.9834;-74.8354
