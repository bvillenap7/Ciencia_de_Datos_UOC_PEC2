Unknown shape flying sraight line.;2014-05-26 19:50:00;3 minutes;Unknown shape flying sraight line My son and I saw a flying object with a hole in the center moving straight across the sky. The object was black and metallic, and shape was definitely not a plane, helicopter, balloon, blimp, kite, hang glider, or any other known aircraft.   As the object flew west to east, it slowly spun as it proceeded along a straight line.  No lights on the object.;40.3202777777778;-74.2764444444444
