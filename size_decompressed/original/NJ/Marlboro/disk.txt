So close , seemed like we could touch it. What's funny is that I decided to check if anyone had seen what we saw back in 2001, and on this great website, I noticed someone reported the SAME exact thing we saw in the sky that night in the same town, around the same time.  And he or she nailed it!    I have yet to this day seen such a UFO sighting on the internet, then I saw with my own two eyes.  It was magnificent.  It looked to be 3-4 hours down and only 100 feet to about 300 feet above ground, but I bet it was much farther.  You could literally see the lights on this thing, like it was high definition, almost out of a si-fi film.   And like the other reported it made a very eerie sounds as it left, and I kid you not you could see the stars move then come back together!!!  It was remarkableâ€¦   So happy to see that we were not the only ones to see this aircraft, this phenomenon!;40.3202777777778;-74.2764444444444
