I don't remember the exact date It happened. In 1978 when i was driving home to new york state. I was driving home on route 4 west when;1978-05-24 01:30:00;7 to 10 minutes;I don't remember the exact date It happened. In 1978 when i was driving home to new york state. I was driving home on route 4 west when I noticed to my left on the east bound side of route 4. An object that i thought was a helicopter at tree top level it  was a cigar shaped craft. I was driving home to New York State from River Edge New Jersey. I got onto route 4 west about 1:30 - 2:00 am I just pulled onto the highway when i noticed on my left side on the east bound lane I saw what i thought was a helicopter i slowed down to look at it and i took a good look at it and i knew it was'nt a helicopter. I rolled down my window to look at it and i did'nt hear any engine sound it was silent. When i noticed it was cigar shaped i got scared and steped on the gas to get away. It was odd that when i stepped on the gas it sped up the same instant as me  and when i slowed down it slowed down the same instant that i did.It was like they knew what my every move was going to be. I went up the highway looking out my window and it was still on the other side of the road following me and going the same speed as i was driving. I was approching route 17 north which was the next road for me to take to go home.Just before i got onto route 17 i pulled over to the side of the shoulder and stopped. It stopped and hovered in silence across the other side of the highway.I got out of my car and there was a dead silence it moved from the tree tops down to the front of the trees and i could see inside the windows on the side of the craft and i saw two figures that did'nt look like human beings and when i saw that i jumped into my car and sped off to the on ramp of route 17 north i looked behind me and it was following me and i don't remember getting on route 17 north the next thing i remembered was i was pulling into my driveway in Middletown New York and it was daybreak the sun was starting to come up It was about 5:00am. The odd thing about it is that it takes 1 hour to get from River Edge to Middletown New York. I have about 4 hours of missing time. To this day Im still bothered about what happened to me. The next day it was in the bergen county news paper that there was alot of sightings of ufo's over paramus new jersey the same area i was driving my car. The police station was swamped with calls of alot o! f  people that saw the ufo. I am in the process of trying to get a copy of the newspaper from the hacensack public library It should be on microfilm. I was wondering if you have any knowlege of this ufo incident that happened in 1978. And if you can help me with any information about this or someone in my area of new jersey that can help me out with my missing time I would appreciate your help very much.;40.9479630769231;-74.0693738461539
