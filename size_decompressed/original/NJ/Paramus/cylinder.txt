cylindrical craft making no noise sighted over Paramus/Haworth/Oradell and Dumont NJ.;2008-02-17 06:48:00;20 minutes;cylindrical craft making no noise sighted over Paramus/Haworth/Oradell and Dumont NJ. I was driving home from Ramsey, NJ on Rt.17, when I noticed these white streaks in the sky. As i continued to drive south I saw that a craft was leaving the streaks. When I exited off of Rt. 17, I was proceeding east on soldier hill road, when I again saw the craft leaving the trails. I exited my vehicle, and noticed that the craft wasnt that high at all. I would estimate that it was only a couple of thousand feet. Yet, it made no noise. It was cylindrical in shape, and was criss-crossing the sky leaving these white contrails.  I entered my vehicle, and as I was driving past the Oradell reservoir, I again saw the craft, and again I exited my vehicle to watch it. As it passed, I again noticed that it made no noise. I finally made my way home, when I again saw the craft. Leaving the white contrails (vapor trails). Some were several miles in length, and would widen to a couple of hundred feet. This time as the craft came overhead (again with no noise), I took some pictures, I got the trails (contrails, vapor trails - not really sure what they are). But, I could not get a clear picture of the craft. After I file this report, I will attempt to blow up some of the pictures to see if I see anything. If you would like copies of the photographs, I would be glad to forward them along.  The incident started about 6:45 and ended at 7:27.  Thanks,  ((name deleted));40.9479630769231;-74.0693738461539
