At approximately 2310 hours on July 13, 2002, the ensuing was observed in the western sky over northern New Jersey:  Two bright lights, which appeared to be stars, were seen moving slowly in formation (one adjacent to the other) on an approximate north east heading.  The atmospheric conditions were clear with vsibility unlimited.  The two objects appeared high up, and were very bright. Within moments of the sighting, a third, less brilliant object, appeared from the north west sky behind the first two objects, and flew between them. It also appeared to be a star.  This third object then changed direction to the north and faded completely. The objects flying in formation then faded completely, and could not be seen.  Several moments later one of these objects pulsed brightly,( a brilliant white light) then faded. Moments later the third object pulsed brightly, ( a brilliant white light) then faded as it continued toward the north. None of the objects was seen again, though the first two must have been drectly overhead the observer's position. At no time could any type of structure be observed, as all three objects appeared to be points of white light, like stars. The objects were moving slowly, and only the third object maneuvered and changed course before fading. The objects did not appear to be connected rather they appeared to be three seperate and distinct unidentified flying objects. Observers include a police officer and two security officers.  One observer holds a private pilot license:  All three observers concur that the sighting was not that of a conventional aircraft.
