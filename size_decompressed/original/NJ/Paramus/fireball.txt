Large white fireball over New York City;1997-12-01 23:30:00;minutes;Large white fireball over New York City Sorry, I don't think this was an extraterrestrial craft, but I think it's worth reporting all the same since it was so unique.  In short, I was driving southbound on the Garden State Parkway just south of Paramus one night near midnight in December.  I don't recall the year, but it had to be 1997, 1998 or 1999, as I was living in the area during that time.  In the eastern sky, directly over Manhattan, I saw a HUGE (like the size of the moon in the night sky), ghostly, smokey white fireball, that looked much like a comet (tail and all), crashing down from above.  It looked as if it was going to crash in the ocean just east of New York City.  It took a few minutes for it to make its way down from the skies above NYC and fall behind it.  I thought I was seeing things, but I noticed drivers and riders in cars around me on the parkway were pointing at it and watching it with the same amazement (and concern) I had.  As it dipped behind NYC, I thought surely this was the end of the world and there would be  blinding flash followed soon by an explosion, concussion wave or tidal wave, etc., but nothing happened.  I scanned the radio, but there was no mention of it.  I checked the TV news shows the next day, and again - nada.  Still, it was a wonderful thing to see, and thankfully with no negative consequences.  Perhaps it was a large metor skimming the upper atmosphere.  Who knows.

7 fireballs, meteors or comets in the western NJ sky October 19th 2014 EST;2014-10-19 15:00:00;1 hour;7 fireballs, meteors or comets in the western NJ sky October 19th 2014 EST From NJ - Looking to the western sky, I saw, what appeared to be 2 comets or fireballs streaking across the sky!  At first I thought they were jets reflecting the sun's light. They were much to bright, as if on fire, and the tails were glowing as well. At a 45 degree angle, they remained in the sky until they went over the horizon. Then, I saw a 3rd one in the Southwestern sky. It to remained in the sky. About 30 minutes passed and then 4 more meteors or comets appeared out of nowhere and also remained in the sky. From my perspective, looking west,  they were traveling left to right toward the sun. Did anyone else see these?;40.9479630769231;-74.0693738461539
