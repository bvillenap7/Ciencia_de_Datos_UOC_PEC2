I am a 16 year old ameture astronomer.My mother who was the other witness is 45. She is a very serious person in the way that she is'nt fooled. At about 23:00 we went from Paramus to Hackensack to pick up my brother from the bowling alley. We say 4 lights that move around in oval orbits.They moved around as a group never changing their movements. We looked for a source of the lights but couldn't find any. You could tell they were moving as a group because you could see that when they crossed pathes it was over a different spot then before.had a bright narrow end and extened to a faded wide end. We watched each one move around and as they met in the middle the bright part of the light seemed to miss each other. When we got home I took out my Telescope and aimed it at a fixed spot where the lights would move through my point of view. After about 5 minutes of consistantly looking through the telescope I saw a little bright dot move just in front of the light. When I called my mom to see she saw that one of the lights stopped and became brighter. I quickly turned the telescope tword it but just as I almost had it in my finderscope it faded away.;40.9479630769231;-74.0693738461539
