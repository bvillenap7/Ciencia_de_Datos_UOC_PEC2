Star Trek-like craft seen over mall.;2015-09-18 21:50:00;Unknown;Star Trek-like craft seen over mall. It looks like a Star Trek type of craft. It had blue and red lights on it.  At first I thought it was a plane but it was hovering over Chase Bank at the Bergen Town Center.  It wasn't that high up either.  I was in a moving car but I could definitely see it hovering, even while I was at a stop light.  I didn't hear any noise coming from the craft either.  Two other witness saw the same thing.
