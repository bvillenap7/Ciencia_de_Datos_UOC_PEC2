Then another one appeared (2 minutes later, perhaps obscured by trees initially) at about 30 or more miles north (or to the right of the first-seen sphere) but exactly at the same elevation as the first-sighted sphere, and also complelely stock-still in the sky.  I then instinctually knew this was extraordinary, and pulled off the road to observe, after seeing this for a total of 7 minutes.  After one minute, both spheres simultaneously moved toward one another, at a steady, very slow speed, in a totally steady linear path, over 60 seconds, then met exactly together and remained the same size and brightness as if superimposed but without change.  Now one, it slowly became smaller, as if moving to the west, but not changing directi! on or moving ( remained very still).  It disappeared over the next 30 seconds till not visible.  No sound was apparent.  No wobble, not corona, no glow.  It seemed that the golden light was self contained. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
