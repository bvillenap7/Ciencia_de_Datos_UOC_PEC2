Linden NJ ... Strange object in sky, same day as Carteret NJ sighting.;2001-06-15 16:35:00;35 minutes;Linden NJ ... Strange object in sky, same day as Carteret NJ sighting. I arrived at the 8th Ward Park in Linden around 4:10pm about an hour before our scheduled softball game. I was the first one there and decided to warm up by going out to the outfield and throwing a ball in the air and catching it. My attention was suddenly drawn to an opaque white object driting across the sky. It was box shaped and at times came to a complete stop. Other times it moved slowly and changed directions several times. I had a good view as the sky was clear and there was really nothing else in the sky. I was hoping that one of my teamates would arrive soon so I could have another witness. Eventually it just moved off out of sight slowly before anyone else arrived. I thought that it could possibly be some type of weather balloon but I wasn't sure. About 20 minutes later my buddy Steve arrived and I hesitantly told him about it not wanting him to think that I was losing it. That's when he told me about the object(s) sighted over Carteret NJ ( not far from where we were ) earlier that morning. I had no prior knowledge of the Carteret incident earlier in the day, but I find this to be a very strange coincidence.;40.6357;-74.2527
