Two lights (no directional lights or blinking lights) traveling high, and fast speed.;2008-09-20 19:20:00;2 Minutes;Two lights (no directional lights or blinking lights) traveling high, and fast speed. Me and my two friends, one of them currently taking flight lessons witness a solid light, basically looking like a moving star moving south to north. No directional lights (green and red lights) or any blinking lights, which all plans have. There would be no reason for a plane to have landing lights on that high. Then halfway through the sighting we witnessed another smaller craft, less brighter, also no blinking lights traveling in near proximity of the first craft, then traveling faster and began to accend higher than the first craft. First we thought an air force fighter and an arieal refueling tanker, but fighters usually travel in pairs and after refueling, the fighter would decend, not accend higher than the tanker. Also one of those friends saw the same thing, the next day, around same time, this time traveling north to south, also with three other witnesses.;40.6357;-74.2527
