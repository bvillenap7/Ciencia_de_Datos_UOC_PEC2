((HOAX??))  Sunday night, at about 11:30, when I saw a string of lights appear in the sky over a tree.  ((anonymour report));2016-05-09 23:30:00;2 minutes;I was sitting on my enclosed porch on Sunday night at about 11:30 p.m., when I saw a string of lights appear in the sky over a tree next to a house.  This was very low and so close to me.   I was shocked to see this, so I opened the door to get a better look.  It was a UFO sitting in a kind of slant almost like it stalled out and was just sitting there without any sound.  The lights I was seeing were the light at the bottom of the craft you could tell by the outline what it was.  Then the lights started to blink one after the other until it was blinking faster and faster and when it picked up speed the thing just disappeared.  As if some one just put a clock over it.  Blink its gone.  The same way it showed up, blink and it was there.   A few seconds later I heard two jets go over my house as if it was looking for it.  It made me very nervous.
