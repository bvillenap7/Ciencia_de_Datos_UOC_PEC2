I noticed a Orange/Yellow light in the Western sky traveling from the North West twoards the South South East.  It made no noise, was brighter than airplane lights, traveled faster than airplanes and had no blinking lights.  It was followed by a second, third and fourth similiar object in the same path at about four minute intervals.;40.6357;-74.2527

I see the airplanes going by and what looks like a close call but I know the planes are super far apart.  But then I looked closely behind the plane that looked like it was hitting the other.  There was this little white orb following it from a distance.  I was like what is that?  Then, the white light orb started speeding up, going faster than the plane.  I was like OH OH OH SNAP let me get my camera out lol...  Well, the orb caught up to the plane went directly behind/under it and disappeared?  What was this?
