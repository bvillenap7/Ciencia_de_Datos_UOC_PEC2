Green oval shaped UFO.;2013-08-25 22:00:00;3 minutes;Green oval shaped UFO. Its a normal Sunday , around 10:00 pm .  I was taking the trash out and that's when something in the sky grabbed my attention.  I noticed the, slow moving object that hovered in mid air.  It was pretty close to where I was standing from.   The object moved slowly and admitted a green haze light.  Also, the object had a white halo too it  and had a red light at the  very end of the ship,which was blinking.  Also no noise was admitted form the object.  The object moved just too slow to be an aircraft or helicopter, that I know of.  I reasoned that maybe it was a blimp but the object was just way too oval shaped to be a blimp plus the lighting on the object was  nothing close too being the Goodyear's blimp display .  I am not a drinker or drug user and I consent of my report to being of no way a hoax.  If anyone has a reasonable explanation.  Please,I would like to hear it.;40.6357;-74.2527
