Then the beam shot into the sky leaving a blue trail. I was with 3 buddies fishing, and we all looked up at the same time and saw a huge light in the sky. It looked like a firework at first, but it wasn't.  Then within 2 to 3 seconds the huge light, shot into the sky leaving a blue trail while it disappeared into the sky.  Then we all looked at each other asking if we just saw it.  IT was very weird.;40.5182;-75.0345
