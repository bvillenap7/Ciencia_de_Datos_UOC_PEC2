ON SEPTEMBER 8, 2003 AT 23:05, WHILE WATCHING MARS FROM MY SECOND-FLOOR SOUTH WINDOW, I OBSERVED A BRIGHTLY LIT OBJECT IN THE SKY JUST ABOVE THE TREELINE SOUTH OF MY HOUSE IN BEDMINSTER AND ABOVE BRIDGEWATER TOWNSHIP.  THE OBJECT SUDDENDLY APPEARED IN MY VIEW AND MOVED SLOWLY FROM EAST TO WEST FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS BEFORE DISAPPEARING.  THE HORIZONTAL OBJECT WAS A FLATTENED OVAL, AND SEEMED TO HAVE TWO STORIES OF NUMEROUS WINDOWS OR LIGHTS.  THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE THE WIDTH AND A QUARTER WIDER THAN THE MOON ON SEPTEMBER 8.  IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEEING THE OBJECT, I MADE A SKETCH OF THE POSITION OF WHAT I HAD SEEN.  AT 23:35, I TELEPHONED THE BEDMINSTER TOWNSHIP POLICE TO REPORT WHAT I HAD SEEN AND ASKED IF ANYONE ELSE HAS REPORTED SEEING THIS OBJECT.  THE ANSWER WAS NO.  I AM A COLLEGE GRADE, AN ARTIST AND A JOURNALIST.  I HAVE NEVER WITNESSED ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.;40.6649923076923;-74.6154692307692
