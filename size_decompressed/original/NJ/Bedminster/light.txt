Saw object flash bright light twice as it crossed the horizon at an extremely high rate of speed.;2015-06-10 01:00:00;2 seconds;Saw object flash bright light twice as it crossed the horizon at an extremely high rate of speed. My wife and I were taking a walk and were staring at the stars in a darker area of the street cause the street lights were not working.  We suddenly saw an object/star like thing flash brightly (white light) around 4 o'clock high going from east to south west in the sky.   What was unusual cause at first we thought a satellite was that it was moving extremely fast and horizontal to the horizon and it flashed brightly then the light went out and we estimated, based on its apparent speed where it might flash again, and it did before it disappeared beyond the trees and horizon.   We never saw anything move so fast, based on how quickly it moved across the horizon.  There was no sound, smoke trail or anything like that.;40.6649923076923;-74.6154692307692
