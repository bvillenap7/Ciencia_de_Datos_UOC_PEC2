My mom noticed these orange reddish lights in the sky in clusters.  She told me to look up west of where we were traveling.  I noticed the lights in the sky.  There was about 3 glowing lights in almost a triangle form and surrounding were the same lights but of a sporadic form. We observed around 8-10 of them.  They were traveling west to east slowly.  As we traveled we lost sight and couldn't figure out what these flying objects were.  I thought it could of been some kind of air force but usually they travel in a formation. And these objects were not. They were not planes either.;40.6649923076923;-74.6154692307692
