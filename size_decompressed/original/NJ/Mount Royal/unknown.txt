Unknown contact event;1976-06-15 19:00:00;2 hours;Unknown contact event Suddenly the sky darkened as if a thunder cloud but it never rained and it was an isolated area. There was something huge and black in the cloud. I had a very uneasy feeling that I was being watched and a feeling of a low level electromagnetic anomaly   Actually I can't describe the feeling well, some form of energy surrounded the area where I was sitting in my car outside my home. I felt contacted by some force but no message or no control of me.  But the weirdest part is when I woke up the next morning my pillow was covered with blood but I had no injury or sign of nose bleed.  Nothing like this has happeneed before or since. Something very strange happened. I've been afraid to tell anybody because I was afraid of a return of whatever it was. I realize this is not a very good report, but that is what happened. It is not a joke or hoax.;39.8102;-75.2057
