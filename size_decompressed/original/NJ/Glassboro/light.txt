3 lights moving in sky over Route 322;2020-03-16 00:02:00;7 minutes;3 lights moving in sky over Route 322 While driving on Route 322 in Glassboro, NJ I saw 3 white lights in sky.  Two of the lights were on top of each other and the 3rd flew to their left.  Appearing to be separated by 1/4 mile (guessing).  The 2 that were one on top of the other were close. To close for them to be planes or helicopters.  No flashing lights.  The 2 lights You could tell they were moving in sync with each other for about 3 minutes.  Then the 3rd light that was to their left cut right flying past them.  Now the 3rd light was about a 1/4 mile from them on their right side.  It covered that distance in about 4-5 seconds easily.  No way a plane or helicopter could travel that distance that fast then stop.  Soon as this light stopped, the bottom light of the 2 that flew together dropped what appeared to be 100 yards (guessing) and stayed at this position for about 10 seconds then abruptly shot back up to the same exact spot it was in before.  When it got back to its position then 3rd solo light s! hot fast further right and I couldn’t see it anymore because this is occurring as I’m driving down Route 322.  I couldn’t safely look to try to locate it.  The 2 lights remained in my view for another 2-3 min and I couldn’t find them in the sky anymore. This happened a few minutes after Midnight.;39.7077;-75.1139
