We had a clear line of sight for miles.  As we where watching a triangular shape began to take shape (lights only), but moving together. They past us right over head..no sound!   Then all of a sudden one by one the amber colored bright lights began to fade away.  We thought that was it! Nope....9 more came, one by one they followed the large light pattern that we first had noticed...all i can say is having knowledge of aircraft and in the industry for years.... no this isnt ours. the lights also began to change color...hard to discribe, (muti colored) never saw this type of light on any of our aircraft......NEVER!!!!!;40.963;-74.7532
