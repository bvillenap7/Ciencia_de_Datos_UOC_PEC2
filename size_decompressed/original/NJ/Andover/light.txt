Bright Orange Plasma Lights.;2015-09-13 19:30:00;20 minutes;Bright Orange Plasma Lights. Walked out to the hot tub last night and noticed a strange orange very bright light traveling north west out of Hackettstown, New Jersey, towards the Lake Tranquility area, called the wife out to view this strange light, and to our amazement at least 19 more travel right above us, no sound, and so brilliant it was hard to look at, the home next door had a party and the people began to come out on the deck to view it as well.    This  same event happened about 3 years ago, except these light where much brighter.  Very Very Strange indeed!!!!!;40.963;-74.7532
