CAPSULE SHAPED CRAFT RAPIDLY DESCENDS INTO WAREHOUSE PARK.;2017-04-29 19:05:00;30 seconds;CAPSULE SHAPED CRAFT RAPIDLY DESCENDS INTO WAREHOUSE PARK. Here's a quick report of a Capsule shaped craft I viewed, while sitting at the local laundromat, waiting for the clothes to dry.   Glanced out the window and to the northeast over Rte. 1 at approx. 7:05 pm EDT.  Observed an object in a steep dive (70 degrees) at a high rate of speed, no wings or engines visible and shaped like a TYLENOL aspirin capsule shape with flat sides....hard to guess size but  would say it was size of a minivan ....object continued its path, and I lost sight of it behind the strip mall across the highway...... BRILLIANT white in color and had a FUZZY APPEARANCE around the bottom edge.........if it continued on this path is would have taken it to an industrial warehouse park approx SE 5 miles away and is near the river and pretty much desolate on the weekend.
