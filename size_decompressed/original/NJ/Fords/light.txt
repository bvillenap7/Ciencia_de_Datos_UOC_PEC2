Very Bright Light;2010-12-18 04:30:00;10 min.;Very Bright Light I was outside taking a smoke break and looking to the East in the direction of Fords, NJ, from the Plainfield NJ area and happend to notice a very very bright white light that was not moving allmost like a helicopter but with no sound. after watching it for about 5 min. it started to slowly move upward, i also had noticed a small red light on the bottom of it that would pulse on and off very slow but the red light didnt seem to have a steady pattern with the pulse. the object was still in or about the same spot when i went inside 5 min later. going back outside soon to see if its still there. at the distance i was standing from the object, i would have heard it if it was a helicopter.
