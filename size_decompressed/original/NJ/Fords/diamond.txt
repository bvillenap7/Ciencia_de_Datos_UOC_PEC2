It stopped in the sky and hovered for a few minites. I knew it was not a Airplane because it did not have the standard wing lights or colors. It had a bright white light in the middle of the object. It disappeared behind the nieghbors house. I got up off the porch to get a better view when it shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.;40.5407;-74.314
