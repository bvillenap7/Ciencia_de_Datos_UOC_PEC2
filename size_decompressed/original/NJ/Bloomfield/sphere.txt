About 30 bright orange spheres moving slowly but steadily West to East towards New York City;2016-06-29 23:30:00;3 minutes;About 30 bright orange spheres moving slowly but steadily West to East towards New York City I saw at first one at a time, then occasionally a few closer together, orange spheres that were very bright and only semi-flickering moving slowly across the night sky from west to east, towards New York City.  They moved from different heights but approximately all the same speed.  However, they seemed to originate at a low point and progress upward and then level out a bit in the sky as they moved across.  I watch the stars in the night sky daily and have never seen anything even close to like this before.  I feared they were some type of missile with all the terrorism lately.  The most recent New York report (I believe it was 6/22) sounded a lot like what I saw.  They appeared silent.;40.8022000000001;-74.1913999999999
