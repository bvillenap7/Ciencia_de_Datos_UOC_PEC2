Metallic Teardrop shaped object sited over NYC a few days after the WTC bombing, no joke!;2001-09-16 19:00:00;10 minutes;Metallic Teardrop shaped object sited over NYC a few days after the WTC bombing, no joke! I like to think of myself as a pretty rational person, but I have an open mind to the possibilities of UFOs/aliens.  I'm not a 100% believer, but simply that it's possible.  Now that I've qualified myself so you all don't think I'm a nut.) On the evening of Sunday, 9/16 at about 6pm I was on my back patio picking up messages from my cell phone.  As I was listening to messages I heard planes going overhead, the planes caught my attention considering the WTC bombing occurred earlier in the week and I was surprised to hear the planes in the air.  As I was watching a plane go over I noticed an object far beyond/above the plane that caught my eye.  The object was a little South East of me.  I live about 10 miles from NYC and I would guess the object was in that area.  I watched the object for about 5 minutes, it didn't move. I then pointed it out to my 60 yr old neighbor he went inside to get a pair of binoculars.  I focused on the object for a few short minutes:  it was a soft tri-angle shape, almost a teardrop shape, and it was metallic in color.  As I was watching the object it disappeared.  I asked my neighbor if he saw that and he said it shot/flashed to the north...it was a streak/zip that left a short blurred trail behind it .  We discussed what we saw and thought it was maybe a weather balloon, but thinking more on it we didn't think it could be because it remained in one place for at least 10-15 minutes, and then it shot quickly in the opposite direction that the wind blew.  Further, the shape wasn't right either.  It looked like the shape of an upside-down balloon, but a little sharper on the edges.
