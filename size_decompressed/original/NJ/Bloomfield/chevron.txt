Not lit up.  Flew in a straight line visible for 7 seconds. Saw a v shaped object visible for about 7seconds.  Was a clear, starry night.  Was not lit but rather a cloud color or frosted glass color.  Would not have caught my eye but rather I just happend to be looking in the right place at the time.  No sound. Flew in a straight line heading south.  Could not guess an altitude hence the size.  From my vantage point, I'd say, width wise, it took up about 5 times the width of a full moon.;40.8022000000001;-74.1913999999999
