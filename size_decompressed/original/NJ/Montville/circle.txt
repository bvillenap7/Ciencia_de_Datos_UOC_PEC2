Much larger than a star I took a picture and video.  It appears to have a halo effect around it.  It jumps in and out so I got some good pictures.  It definitely had some colors in the center.  It was only there for 1 hour then moved much further back in the sky.  It always appeared to have a tail that was also a bright light .;40.9068;-74.3615
