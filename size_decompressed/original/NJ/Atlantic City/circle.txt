We pulled over, observed the three objects moving rapidly in tandem. The travelled quickly from area to area, always moving as one. This went on for close to 10 mins and they suddenly vanished from sight. Upon arriving at my bosses house, I called the local commercial airport and asked if they'd received reports or had any unusual objects in the sky from a neighboring air facility known as NAFAC. They told me that they had in fact received reports of what I had seen earlier and also told me that they knew of no projects that NAFAC was involved with. This is the one and only time that I've seen phenomena of this type. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

(Sunrise wasn't until 7:01am.)   1 was just below and behind other, path was same as if it was two jets but went faster than I could even point.  They were barely visible but no question they were there.   I have never seen anything in sky move as fast as a shooting star that went from my left across to my right, but did not dip or arc downwards they went straight.;39.3606789473684;-74.4238894736843
