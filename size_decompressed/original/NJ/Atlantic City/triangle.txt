My husband and I were driving on White Horse Pike in AC, when looking up, I thought I saw a flock of black birds, but as I was staring at it I noticed that it was a black triangle with port holes underneath the craft (or the flat bottom of it). It did not have lights and was silently gliding on top of a thin cloud! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));39.3606789473684;-74.4238894736843
Triangular craft hovering 40ft directly above atlantic city expressway, seen twice in 5 minutes;2008-06-30 22:25:00;5 minutes;Triangular craft hovering 40ft directly above atlantic city expressway, seen twice in 5 minutes I left Atlantic City, June 30th getting on the A.C. expressway about 10:15 (north). This all occurred after the 50c pleasantville toll and before the 2$ toll wherever that is. I am driving slow about 60mphs, it had been raining a bit earlier and was still drizzling off and on. I am writing this about 5 hours after the experience. Driving along I notice a Triangular shaped abject hovering directly above the highway maybe 40 feet, very close to us. It seemed to be moving very slowly, no more than 10mph's and it may have been staying still, its tough to judge going down a highway. The object was directly above the highway, with the front point pointing directly at oncoming traffic, I passed directly underneath it and past it. I keep driving still about 60 mphs for a good 3-4 minutes and as I'm thinking what the hell was that thing I see it ahead of me again, same distance above groud, exact same thing. This time I slowdown somewhat to get a good look at this thing and as I pass by underneath it this time, I roll down my window to see if I could hear anything, but did not hear anything. There wasn't a ton of traffic, but there was a good amount of cars around a couple zooming past me as I slowed down to get a better look. This was a black triangular shaped object about 25 feet each way, with white lights on the corners, the 2 back lights did not appear to emit any kind of shine, just very pure white lights. I did get a good look at the front light though, which did emit a light beam strait ahead of it that I noticed. The light itself was the whole front tip of the triangle, the front ended in a single tipped point, the light starting from that point seemed to extend about a foot back seeming almost crystal like as it seemed somewhat see through. I did my best to look underneath it as I got close, I did see some white lights on the bottom of the craft. The object didn't seem to have any aura or haze around it, When I noticed it the first time I immediately thought it must be a helicopter hovering so close to the ground probably enforcing the speed limit, it turned out not to be a helicopter. And that is it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));39.3606789473684;-74.4238894736843
Space Shuttle Shape traving very fast, faster then its sound.;2009-01-30 19:20:00;7 seconds;Space Shuttle Shape traving very fast, faster then its sound. As i walked out my front door, I noticed a Space-Shuttle/Concord shaped flying object that was flying north, over the Atlantic Ocean or the Absecon Island in New Jersey. The object was flying at incredible speeds and a loud sound after the UFO was almost out of my sight ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
