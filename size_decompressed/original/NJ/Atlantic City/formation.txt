Lasted from 40 to 60 minutes First sighted couple of lights above the ocean, but I thought it was TV reflection on hotel windows, but was wrong.  After 10 minutes saw couple of lights above some hotel rooms. They moved around, then flew away in different directions.  After 5-6 minutes, bunch of them came back, brighter, faster, made some formations. Took couple of videos through the window.;39.3606789473684;-74.4238894736843
