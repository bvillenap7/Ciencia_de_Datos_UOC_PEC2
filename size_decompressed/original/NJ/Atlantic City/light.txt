Numerous unknown objects moving at fast rates circling each other .;2003-06-28 22:00:00;steady;Numerous unknown objects moving at fast rates circling each other . I was on a tour bus heading out of Atlantic city to new york , when I looked up at the sky and saw numerous unknown objects circling the sky. They were emitting some form of light and circling each other and fast distances. There were about I say 20-30 of these uknown objects and they were spread out . Some just stood there emitting light but others were moving at fast rates. I want to know what I saw exactly please let me knoe. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I saw lights in the sky while coming back from Atlantic City in a bus!;2003-08-29 20:58:00;For minutes;I saw lights in the sky while coming back from Atlantic City in a bus! Ok, I'm 14 years old and my name's ((name deleted)). I went with my mom and dad to Atlantic city on a travel bus. When we were going back to where I am from (that's Elizabeth, New jersey) the bus lights went off so that everyone could sleep (it was 6:40 when we left) My mom and I tryed to sleep but couldn't, at the end my mom fell asleep but I kept looking out the window. Finally I got some sleep and woke up about 8:40 or 8:48 PM. It was night and the sky was dark, wind was blowing from the looks of it (All the windows were closed) and the cars were passing by fast. When I look at the sky, I see the moon and far away from it one star, one lonely star, I told my mom and she looked at it. Indeed it was a star... but then all of a sudden two flashing lights appear above it, way above it. The lights were blinking and I didn't take them for importance because I thought they were planes... but then 3 more appeared to the left of them, below them. I was surprised and started watching closely... Not wanting to tell my mom because she was sleeping. One of the lights that appeared earlier stopped blinking and become very bright, then went upwards into the sky, VERY fast. It was going fast and far away into the clouds. By this time I didn't think it was a plane... They had no sound (but we had the windows closed so we couldn't know.) Then the other 2 that appeared earlier went right, very fast and the others who appeared later stopped blinking and disappeared completely... Anyways... they disappeared and I went back to sleep, then woke up again and was (8:58 PM) ...and the freaking bus still didn't make it to Elizabeth... when I look out the window, there was a blinking light... and it was going down on some bushes/forest. I looked closely and 3 more blinking lights appeared near it and went upwards then to the right and finally disappeared into the clouds... I made my mom look and she was surprised that anything could move like that... There was also two jet-like planes (or maybe the same lights but closer?...) that were chasing those lights.. They were only two and they passed right above the bus... they moved like planes... so I thought they were jet-planes... they disappeared into the clouds in the direction of the light objects. I just shrugged and went back to sleep. By the time I woke up we were already back. Personally, I have never seen such sighting in my life. I mean... Maybe sometimes I see a ball of light moving then disappearing but I have never seen groups and appearances like that... I was scared! hehe... We got out of the bus, bought something to eat, went home, ate and we slept happily ever after... Then I woke up and came to this site... started writing. That's my sighting and how I left atlantic city.;39.3606789473684;-74.4238894736843
We just witnessed an object off of Atlantic City New jersey that seemed to have split into five or six pieces within a split second.;2008-04-16 20:10:00;10 min.;We just witnessed an object off of Atlantic City New jersey that seemed to have split into five or six pieces within a split second or two. I have operated commercial sea clam vessels off the Atlantic coast for many years and I have never witnessed anything like this. My house overlooks Atlantic City and I enjoy the views with a set of surplus Russian boarder patrol glasses. I am sure of what I just saw and so is my wife. The speed that this object moved was incredible, my glasses are equiped with range finders and I can tell you that nothing that I know of can move like that. About ten minutes after we sighted the object there was a very large tremor that we experiened.   Thanks for your time  ((name and company deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone.  He is an extremely experienced observer, we believe.  He later reported that an FAA employee had informed him that the lights were part of an exercise by the U. S. Air Force.  We cannot confirm that latter fact.  Please see similar report from the Kokomo, IN, area for the same date.  PD));39.3606789473684;-74.4238894736843
12 lighted objects in four formations appeared from the cloud cover;2008-08-27 19:45:00;4 Minutes;12 lighted objects in four formations appeared from the cloud cover My wife and I were walking on the boardwalk about 19:45 when we observed looking out towards the ocean, 12 circular lighted objects moving slowly out of the cloud formation without sound in 4 V shape formations. I would estimate they were about one or two mile off shore and about 750 to 1000 feet above sea level. They could have been higher. They stopped briefly only about 5 seconds and backed into the cloud cover, then some moved forward again out of the clouds, then I tried to take a picture but could not see them as they moved back into the clouds. Then about 5 lights moved forward outside the clouds and returned into the clouds. I tried to take a picture but they returned into the clouds. I waited with camera ready, not to miss the next oppertunity but they did not return. A man and a female stopped and he asked if I saw the lights and what did I think they were? I told them alien space crafts. He replied strange, and continued on. I waited for a while but the lights never came out of the heavy cloud cover. We continued to enjoy our evening walking on the boardwalk and later lost at the casino and then went home.;39.3606789473684;-74.4238894736843
ZigZagging Light over Atlantic Ocean off Coast of Atlantic City, NJ;2008-11-16 02:30:00;less that a minute;ZigZagging Light over Atlantic Ocean off Coast of Atlantic City, NJ To Whom It May Concern:   On November 16th, 2008 at approximately, 2:30am, my friend and I were walking to our vehicle which was parked on the top floor of the parking garage at a casino in Atlantic City.  While looking out towards the Atlantic Ocean, coast line began roughly ½ mile in distance from where we stood, I noticed a quasi orange/amber light very thin, and rough 1 inch wide (from my perspective) slowly flying from the south parallel to the coast line, then do a zigzag and dart off north. My initial thought was that this was a shooting star based on what I have seen in the past.  Also the shape of the object was very similar to a shooting star as well.  The thing that really caught my eye was at the slow speed it traveled.  Most shooting stars are gone in a flash not too mention the altitude of the object was in our atmosphere, not outside.  Once I noticed how abnormal it was I then brought the object to the attention of my friend to make sure I wasn’t hallucinating.  We had just left a bar and were not completely sober, but we were also not completely inebriated either. We both saw the same thing, and it was completely legit. Take care,;39.3606789473684;-74.4238894736843
Multicolored light in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a twinkling star.  PD));2010-08-25 05:00:00;20 minutes;Multicolored light in the sky. A light in the sky was changing colors.  I thought it might be a star or planet, but I knew where the planets should be that morning.  Also, the light seemed to move slightly in the sky, getting closer and brighter.   I got into my car to drive closer to the beach, and as I approached, the light dimmed and dimmed.   When I reached the beach the light slowly faded into the sky.

Strange light off  of Atlantic City ocean.;2014-10-27 19:00:00;10 minutes;Strange light off  of Atlantic City ocean. I came to Atlantic City to watch a rocket launch from Virginia so we had to look out over the ocean.  We thought we were seeing the rocket because it was around the time for liftoff. However the liftoff was canceled due to a boat in restricted waters.  It was a bright white light that seemed to move upwards then grew dim and something split off from it and became bright again.  After that it grew dimmer then disappeared.;39.3606789473684;-74.4238894736843
