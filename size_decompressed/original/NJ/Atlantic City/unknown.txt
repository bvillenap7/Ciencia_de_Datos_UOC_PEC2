As me, my uncle, sister and her daughter were on our way back from the Atlantic City Airport, me and my uncle noticed a green object in the air a few miles after getting on the parkway north.  The object was moving pretty fast and was maybe about 150 ft or so off the ground at a slight angle descending towards the ground.  The object quickly became out of sight as it just disappeared into the dark, but there was nothing to hide it as the sky was clear and there were no trees to block it.  It almost looked as if it were a shooting star coming towards the earth.;39.3606789473684;-74.4238894736843

It was large & bright white floating horizontally in a clear blue sky.  I only had a few minutes to observe it and watched it dip downwards but kept its long shape, this object was a solid mass and not a cloud or jet trail & it was gone a few minutes later by the time I came thru the tunnel.;39.3606789473684;-74.4238894736843
