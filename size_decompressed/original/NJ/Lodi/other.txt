I saw four bright lights hovering in the sky. As i make the turn into my home the craft slowly started to drift. Literally no sound just glided and disappeared. At first i thought it was a drone, but this way way to big to be a drone. It was night time couldn't see the shape nor color. I can say is that it had four bright lights and it hovered in the sky for about 15 seconds and quietly disappeared.;40.8768;-74.0866999999999
