Animal mutilation possibly UFO;2020-08-30 00:00:00;unknown;Animal mutilation possibly UFO Hello! I wanted to report this animal mutilation to your organization since it may be  UFO involved..  I already reported it to Linda Moulton Howe who has reported on cow mutilations in the past that may involve UFO's.  So this deer was not there about 1 day ago and look at it.  The face on the deer is cut like the cows were in some of the investigations of the cow mutilations.  Sending 2 pictures for you to look at and a copy of my letter sent to Linda Moulton Howe.  thank you, Darren    Hi!  I have watched Linda Moulton Howe on youtube concerning the cow mutilations and I saw this deer on the side of Hamburg Tpk in bloomingdale NJ that was not there the other day .  I know because I deliver there .   As I drove by I noticed it was in a strange position with it legs in the air and looks bloated like it has been dead for a while but it was not there the other day. The most interesting thing is it's face!!!!!   My coworker took two pictures of it and it looks like the face was cut with precision like some of the cows you have reported on. Looks so exactly the same.. I am sending you the pictures. The deer is still there as i write this e-mail between 55  an 90 hamburg tpk bloomingdale nj 07403  What do you think ?  Thank you for your time ,  Darren;41.0139;-74.3353
