Tennis Ball size blue sphere objects.;1989-10-15 20:00:00;35 seconds;Tennis Ball size blue sphere objects. On a clear October night on or about the 15th at around 8 Oclock in the evening. Myself, my brother and 3 friends where watching television in our family room. Which backs to a wrap around deck and then to the woods. To describe the room is easy, think of an open sunroom just enclosed with windows instead of screens. About 3 feet off the top of the decks flooring we saw a Blue sphere approximately an inch or 2 bigger than a tennis ball. Its seemed to come directly from the woods. Then it stopped in a stationary position outside on the deck in front of the window and then after 10-15 seconds broke into about 5 pieces all in the shape of a sphere and disappeared.;41.0139;-74.3353
