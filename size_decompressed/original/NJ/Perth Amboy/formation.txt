Earlier that day there was one single loud thunder, I dont know if it has any connection, it could have been a sonic boom. after what I witnessed the sky started to fill with clouds almost as if there was some weather control, thats only speculation, but i assure you that those 4 lights were not birds, lights shinning from earth or lightning.  I am a skeptic and dont jump to conclusions. I still am not convinced there was an intelligence behind these lights, but I hope there is.;40.5141;-74.27355
