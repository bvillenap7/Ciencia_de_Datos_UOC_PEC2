I was driving, It came out of no where, towards the right of my car in the sky but pretty close to trees.  It caught my eyes and my boyfriends eyes and we wernt even looking in the sky it was that bright!  I seriously thought it was an astroid but nothing has been reported in the news.  I felt that I have lost my breath for that time.  Theres been another time in our lives last year we've seen a similar object in the sky around the keyport area.;40.5141;-74.27355
