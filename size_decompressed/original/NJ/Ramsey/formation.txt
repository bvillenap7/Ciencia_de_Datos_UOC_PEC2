All of a sudden, 2 strange objects (will get to looks below) appear from the South -South/East from behind a tree in my backyard. They appeared to be about 150-175 feet above the ground (a small distance above the tallest trees nearby).  The objects were completely silent although travelling at high speeds and seemingly not that far away from us.  They seemed to be going about 400-500 mph and were heading straight to the North slightly North/West. The entire sighting lasted about 2 seconds before they disappeared behind some other trees on the North end of my backyard.  It is hard to describe the appearance. The shape seemed to be slightly triangular, and tiered. As if 3 triangles were stacked on top of each other overlapping one another by 50%. There were 2 sets like this, flying in tandem approximately 100 feet apart. It appeared as if they were each about 50 ft tall and 20 ft wide.  They were a dark smoky color. The outline of them was bolder than the middle. They had a very strange almost enigmatic look - like a jelly fish or a cell under a microscope.  That is all I can recall about the incident which occurred 55 minutes before writing this.;41.0631;-74.1437
