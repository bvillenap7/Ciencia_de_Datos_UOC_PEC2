The movie was boring so I looked up to my left above the screen. I saw a starlike object stationary for 2 minutes which then moved slowly to the right.The object then stopped in mid flight for about a minute. It did this two more times before flying out of sight behind the trees. My friend and I both saw the object while in my car.The object could be seen very well.With fifty other cars at the movie it's foolish to think we were the only ones to see it. It flew right above the screen. The object was a single point of light.;40.0004;-75.0252
