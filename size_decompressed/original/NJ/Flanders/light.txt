Four orange lights over Flanders, NJ.;2015-09-27 19:00:00;5 minutes;Four orange lights over Flanders, NJ 9/27/15 - My husband and I were driving eastbound on Route 80 towards Flanders, NJ.  I was especially interested in the sky because of the super moon.   At about 19:00, I looked towards the left and saw two large bright orange lights in the sky just past the westbound lane of the highway.  I told my husband to look left and he saw them also.   We pulled over to try to get a video, but by that time, they had traveled some distance and were joined by two other orange lights.   All the lights proceeded to travel away from us westward and finally disappeared from our view. Neither of us has ever seen anything like this.;40.8462;-74.7056000000001
