Pulsating object In Flanders NJ, July 2020.;2020-07-15 21:18:00;2 minutes;Pulsating object In Flanders NJ, July 2020. I was in my backyard (off-duty) and looking to the south-southwest. I observed a bright white object moving quickly from the southwest to the east. It moved erratically and pulsated sometimes flashing different colors. It seemed to be very far away. This was the same night the ISS was supposed to cross our horizon however this was not it, I spotted the ISS about 1 hour later using sky view app and observed it come from the western horizon and travel north east.  I took video of the object I saw, a short clip. In the video youâ€™ll hear my fire in the background and see an ember fly up, that is to be ignored.;40.8462;-74.7056000000001
