UFO on the night of the Paterson Falls View Festival;1978-06-01 21:00:00;2 minutes;UFO on the night of the Paterson Falls View Festival I dont recall the exact date but I remember it was on the Night of the Falls View Festival in Paterson and it had to be between 1975-78. My mother and I were walking to the Falls along with dozens of other people and directly above us we witnessed a hovering  object, It appeared round from our view with circling lights on the bottom. It s hard to say how high it was but my mother and I and a crowd of people including a police officer who shined his spotlight on the object stood there spellbound for at least 2 full minutes until it slowly drifted off to the side and out of sight.  There is an entry for a sighting in Paterson in 1980 and it sounds very similar,  I have always wondered if anyone still remembers that night. My mom and I have never forgotten that night nor have we ever seen another sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Lights over Paterson NJ 1980;1980-03-01 21:00:00;1 minute;Lights over Paterson NJ 1980 It was at night around 9:00pm the sky was clear and the night was beautiful.   When me and a couple of my family members were on our porch talking, it started to get very bright in the sky and all of the sudden we looked up and there was this great big round object directly above us it was so low that it could have not been any higher than five hundred feet up in the air.   We were all in shock that by the time our eyes could focus correctly it was gone as quick as it showed up.The disk was very big and it had multi colored lights spinning on the bottom of it and it had many small windows around the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));40.9146336170212;-74.1628634042554
HUGE disk hovering over the city of Paterson in the very early 1980's.;1980-03-20 20:00:00;one minute;HUGE disk hovering over the city of Paterson in the very early 1980's. I am not sure of the exact date, but it was around 1980-1081. My now husband, then fiance, were sitting in a PARKED/TURNED OFF car at Garrett Mt. New Jersey, which overlooks the city of Paterson. He was sitting in the drivers seat and I was sitting in the passenger seat. We were looking at each other and talking. Suddenly, we noticed a HUGE disk hovering over the city of Paterson! It seemed as huge as the city itself. Underneath the disk there were round lights of red, blue, green and yellow. The lights seemed as though they were rotating. Within several seconds the radio started to flicker on our PARKED/TURNED OFF car. It was a fuzzy, unclear signal. I remember the car sputtering as though the engine was trying to turn over, my husband does not remember that he only remembers the affect that the craft had on the radio. Then, just as suddenly as it appeared, the disk was simply gone. There were other people parked there that day. The odd thing is that we never got out of the car and nobody got out of their car. We have been searching for someone else who saw this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.9146336170212;-74.1628634042554

It was;1985-06-30 18:00:00;few seconds;Back in 80's while our family lived in Paterson by the Eastside HS area. I remember walking to the store with a friend of mine. It was maybe around 7p or so but, it was already dark. A large disk like object came out of nowhere and I remember the lights flash in a circular motion over the sky. The object came from nowhere and then just disappeared. This must of occurred within a few seconds. I still remember that night and gives me goose bumps when I think of that night. I never saw a UFO after that ever. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));40.9146336170212;-74.1628634042554
