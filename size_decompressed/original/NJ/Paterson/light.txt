We would like other reports from the area before we conclude that there was anything unusual about the sighting.)) At around 10.45 p.m when I just looked at the sky, i found 5 lighted objects.  The size of these lights were double the diameter of the moon size.  These lights were light blue in colour.  Four of these lighted objects were moving in a particular rhythmn, whereas one was solitary.  These four lights would converge at one point and then they would move out and again come and converge.  This sequence was repeating itself many times.  Whereas the other solitary lighted object was just moving from left to right.  This happened for about 6-7 minutes and then they all started moving left to right.  The sky was cloudy.  This light was not very sharp but a kind of dispersed type. After ten minutes these lights disappeared.  Again at around 11.55 p.m. when i saw in the sky I saw one light moving from left to right,after a few secs there was one more, only this time the light was no longer circular, but shaped like a elongated pear.  The speed of these lights were medium.

The clips which we captured on the video are not clear, since it was very dark.  But only we can see some lights moving across the dark sky. The speed of these lights were medium. This event was witnessed by myself, my wife and our two years old son.;40.9146336170212;-74.1628634042554
