I was driving on I-80 heading west, passing the city of Paterson at 6:30 in the evening in June while the sky was still very sunlit, at the peak of rush hour from N.Y.C. so there were hundreds of other vehicles on the road.  While I was driving, from my right ear I heard a very high pitched sound, like a turbo charger, and at that moment I saw a blue-white light heading right toward me at tremendous speed.  It was like a shooting star but only 30 ft. above the ground at the highest.  I know this because as it passed over I-80 the object was lower than the overpass ahead evenly following the contour of the hilly terrain,  It was then that a hugh sonic boom occured and rocked my car off the left side wheels, it was such a bang that it felt like something had violently pushed my car, this got my girlfriends attention. Certianly.  At this moment both my, and her left ears popped.  Yes just our left ears, remember the object passed from right to left.  As fast as it had appeared, it was gone.  Pretty incredible wouldn't you say. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Well then he saw another one in the same part of the sky and then I saw another one again also in the same part of the sky the first two had been in I concluded it had to be a meteor shower, then his girl friend said What that moving up there? we were all looking up and we watched as this small little dot moved across the sky I figured it was a satellite it appeared to make a straight line but more like those carts from IKEA make a straight line... NW in direction hugging the west.  We all just keep talking about ghost stories and what we thought of aliens and other things that we all thought maybe we saw something, my, brother and I continued to look at the sky, until I saw another object exactly the same out of the corner of my eye this one looked as if it came from the same sector of the sky! as the fisrt one but was on a slightly different path, now the strange thing about this one is that my brother and I we watching it as I said look it's getting brighter when it light up like a light bulb and then dimmed again, we were both aw stricken for a moment but thought that if it was a satellite it could have been the moon reflecting off of the wing of the satellite, but than I looked into it further and found that only the sun is bright enough to do that but from the angle we were at and where it shinned would have been the complete opposite direction of where the suns beam would have caught it.  anyway the second one looked as if it was also going north but on a different path but hugging the west even more so than the first.  I looked into sighting the next day and found something about the UK, and Uruguay, but nothing that match we we all saw that night any who the sky is still pretty cool!
