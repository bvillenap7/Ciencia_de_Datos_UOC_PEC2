7 Red/Orange orbs.;2012-07-28 21:15:00;5 minutes;7 Red/Orange orbs I was out side on my street corner, I was walking towards my house I looked up and caught sight of approximately 7 glowing or shining red and orange orbs. They were hovering, then moving slow from west to south. There was cloud cover and as they slowly drifted into the clouds , they went out of sight. I live in a very heavy airplane traffic route. Between Newark and Teterboro airport , I see and hear planes and helicopters all the time.  The objects made no sound that I could hear and moved too slow to be planes.  There were no blinking lights, just the red/orange glow. A bit of a scintillation to them, but it's has been raining and there is clouds and some humidity in the air.  I only observed the objects for about 5 mins, before they moved up into the cloud cover,  This is were the dimmed and I could no longer se the lights.  I went home looked out my window at the same area of sky for some time, but only saw the regular air traffic of planes. I went online to the weather channel and local airport radar to see what the cloud cover height was, it says &quotbroken clouds at a height of 1400 feet&quot &quotwinds at 10 mph from the north&quot I can't be sure how high in the air they were. but the did move along the horizon for just a bit before the moved upward into the clouds.;40.7898;-74.1307999999999
