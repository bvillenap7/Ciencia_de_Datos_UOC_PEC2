bright red light dancing around northern new jersy.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD));2009-02-19 19:00:00;2 hours and counting;bright red light dancing around northern new jersy looking out my front door window at around 7:00 pm est. time, I noticed a bright red light directly south from my home.  As I sit here now typing, i can still see the light.  it moves up and down, back and forth quite a bit.  I phoned the police and was told an officer will check it out.  I am still waiting for his arrival.  Oddly enough, I phoned a friend about what I am seeing and he told me that similar reports were on the front page of the newspaper today.  Apparently the sightings were being reported as early as Monday, and it is now Thursday and the bright red light is still there. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD));40.9107;-74.5841
