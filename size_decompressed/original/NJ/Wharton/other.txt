Object  over Rt. 80 standing still with bright white light on bottom and sides...no sound..no movement...;2008-02-24 23:05:00;6 minutes;Object  over Rt. 80 standing still with bright white light on bottom and sides...no sound..no movement... I was traveling west bound on Rt. 80..I noticed a bright white light in the sky..the light was a few miles ahead of me..My first thought was that it was just a plane heading east to Newark Airport. If it was a plane heading east it should have gained on me since i was heading west, but the object was just standing still..As i got closer i noticed a State Trooper sitting on the side of the east bound lanes with his overhead lights flashing, but he/she didnt have a car pulled over..It looked like he/she was there just observing the object as well...The object was about 4 to 5 hundred feet off the roadway and about 200 feet in the air. It was sort of bell shaped with one very bright light on the underside and other not so bright lights along the sides..I slowed down to about 45mph and got a good look at it for about 10-15 seconds...I heard no sound and it didnt look like anything i have ever seen before..I must admit my heart was racing...After returning home i called the police department in the town where i saw the object but was told there were no other reports...I know others must have seen this also because it was so bright and unusual that you couldnt help but notice it.;40.9107;-74.5841
