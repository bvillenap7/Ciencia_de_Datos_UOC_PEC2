Bright red UFO spotted over Northern New Jersey;2011-06-17 21:00:00;3 minutes;Bright red UFO spotted over Northern New Jersey A UFO was spotted from Wharton, NJ at approximately 9pm EST on Friday, June 17, 2011.  We saw it from the second floor window of our house, which faces east.  It seemed to be flying (initially) due west over the skies of Parsippany/Denville.  It was extremely bright and very red in color.  There was also a bit of orange around the perimeter of the object.  It had a triangular shape and was moving slowly...at some points, seeming to just float. It continued west for about a minute and then began heading north.  By the time I made it downstairs and outside to see it, it had moved slightly behind the trees and my view was obstructed.  As I continued to try and see it, it appeared to begin to move back in an eastward direction and eventually I lost sight of it because of the trees. The most notable and striking thing about this UFO was its bright red color.  It almost looked like it was on fire and flaming.;40.9107;-74.5841
