Two bright orbs of red lights and silence !;2014-09-26 20:25:00;8 minutes;Two bright orbs of red lights and silence ! I was working at a haunt outside with other co-workers. It was a cool and clear night. I was star gazing.Caught a shooting star! About 8:25pm ,looking towards the west . I notice a very bright red light! It got closer, than notice the second red light than a third but not that bright. When all three was close enough . I see that the third object was in fact an airplane with its strobe lights flickering and the red and green lights blinking on and off. But the first two  objects were very bright red,no strobe lights or the red and green lights on wings, no sounds neither ! When I started to say to my co-worker what I'm seeing, she started to point out the red objects to me! We stared at it ,trying to figure out what it is ! No sounds from it! Yet ! We see the plane miles  behind it ! We can see the different from the object  to the plane. There were lots of traffic of planes between Philadelphia and McGuire AFB.The red lights were heading toward McGuire area ! .I was raised in the military .Lived next to McGuire and Fort Dix! Seen all kinds of planes flying day or night and even at times knowing what sounds coming from what planes.I need to say and report this sighting ! Lots of my co-workers saw as a did! One co-worker trying explain that it was a chinese lanterns ! Not ! I know the different ! Lanterns are not that bright nor do they move as fast as a plane  .As I stated that the third object was a plane miles behind the bright red light ! Never caught up with the red lights! Than both lights faded not turned off but faded !;40.2122;-74.6221
