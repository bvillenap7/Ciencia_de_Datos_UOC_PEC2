The sky was dark since the sun had already set down. The road was a bit hilly and I was driving upward close to the intersection on 9W right before stopping at a red light, when all of a sudden, an illuminating bright light sped quickly straight across right before the intersection across my path and stopped abruptly a few yards behind a tree on the right corner of the intersection.   Then surprisingly, a second later, another bright, illuminating light sped quickly just as the first light and stopped right before the first bright light stood.  As soon as the second light met up with the first light, they both zoomed straight out to the right and quickly disappeared.   These bright illumination lights happened in a matter of 2-3 seconds only.  Thatâ€™s when I realized that I just encountered a mysterious sighting that happened in a split second.;40.9496;-73.9205
