It was nearly as bright as the sun but of course very tiny in comparison. The weather is exceptionally clear at this time. Note that the light remained stationary for the duration of the sighting and appeared at approximately sixty to seventy degree elevation in the Northern sky at an altitude of over 10K feet. At first, I thought it was Venus (visible near the cresent moon at dusk in the West) but then it 'flickered' or flashed twice. I checked my watch and noted that it flickered regurlarly every ten to fifteen seconds. I waited for my son, who had a dentist's appointment, and when he came out I pointed it out to him. His eyes are better than mine and he thought that the light was slightly elongated and was metallic in appearance. At one point he noted that there appeared to be more than one light in close proximity. We also noted that the  area immediately surrounding the light(s) appeared slightly darker than the rest of the sky.;40.9552;-74.0294
