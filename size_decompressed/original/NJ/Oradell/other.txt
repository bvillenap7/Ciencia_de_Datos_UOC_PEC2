Huge white spotlight moving behind clouds no object or light source visible;2001-02-14 08:45:00;About 1.5 second;Huge white spotlight moving behind clouds no object or light source visible I was waiting at a bus stop on Kinderkamack Road the weather was somewhat overcast but not raining. I was looking up the street for the bus and suddenly saw what looked like a large white spotlight shining down on the cloud layer from above. It was at least the apparent width of two fists at arms' length, and although it was clearly visible and had well-defined edges it was not extremely bright. It was moving from north to south (approximately) when it first 'switched on', and moved across about 1/3 to 1/2 of the sky before it went off again. There was no sound, and the entire sighting lasted about a second and a half. No searchlight beam was visible coming up from the ground, and in any case the light appeared to come from behind the clouds (smaller and lower clouds appeared dark against it).;40.9552;-74.0294
