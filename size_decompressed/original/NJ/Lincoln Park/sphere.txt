Looked across the street, right in front of my townhouse between two single family homes and observed a brilliant white orb moving towards Rte. 202.  The color was so pure. Second sighting -Two days later I was also out in the early morning and out of nowhere a brilliant white orb is streaking across the sky, this time towards me and it made a noise like a booster rocket and had a tail.  It went right over the townhouse next to mine and once it went over the roof I was waiting to hear a crash but there was nothing.   I saw the Channel 4 news cast yesterday, 5/9/17, about the sightings in Suffolk County and the images that were shown was exactly what I saw.
