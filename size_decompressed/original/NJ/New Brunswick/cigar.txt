The craft released white air and was travelling vertically toward earth.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly contrails??  PD));2017-11-29 10:46:00;All day;The craft released white air and was travelling vertically toward earth. I was at Rutgers campus going to my class and i just saw a single cigar shaped UFO coming down toward earth but as i stared at it for a long time it just wouldn’t move.  Furthermore, it was releasing white gas like planes do in high altitudes but the object was flying straight down and the gas streaks were vertical not horizontal as usual.  I ignored.   But as i was driving home i saw the same object, plus two more all having white streaks. I don’t know what they were. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly contrails, we suspect.
