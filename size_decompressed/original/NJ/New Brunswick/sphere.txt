Rotating Orb Seen In New Brunswick Sky;2012-07-07 19:18:00;4 minutes;Rotating Orb Seen In New Brunswick Sky I was going out onto the balcony to smoke when I noticed a strange orb shape in the sky. I immediately called to my boyfriend who was inside on the couch watching TV.  He came outside and I pointed at the object and said &quotWhat is that?&quot.  We both looked at it for a few minutes until we could no longer see it.  The object was an orb shape and it appeared to have a rotating light or light and dark sides that were rotating.  The object was moving quickly across the sky.  This occured as a large thunderstorm was on the horizon.  We are not UFO folks, but this object was really creepy.  Not sure what it was, but it was moving very fast.  There were also several commercial aircraft in the area which we could use to gauge the size of the object. It was probably about the size of a tail (stabilizer fin) of a standard boeing aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
