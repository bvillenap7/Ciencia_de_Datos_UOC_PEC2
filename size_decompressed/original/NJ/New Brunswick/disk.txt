4 blue flying objects hovered in the sky for two minutes, sudden reverse of flying direction during flight.;2001-04-07 20:21:00;2 minutes;4 blue flying objects hovered in the sky for two minutes, sudden reverse of flying direction during flight. I saw 4 flying objects in the sky (eastward). They looked blueish. the weather was cloudy and I could not see very clearly the shape, but it looked round. They looked not very high above ground. The reason I think they were UFO is because the way they changed flying direction. They could suddenly reverse their direction and the acceleration was just not possible for any know man-made machine. They looked like playing each other. UFOs lasted about two minutes. When I went inside to get a camrecorder and to record them, they were gone. however, as a scientist majored in Physics, I must admit those UFOs I saw could be lighting. But I never saw any lighting like that. So I thought it may be a good idea to share my experience with some experts. Hopefully, I am not the only that reported this in NJ. I don't wish to be contacted my phone or mail. But I can be reached by email, in case you have further questions.;40.4880487804878;-74.4544975609756
Shiny, silver disk witnessed high in sky above highway I-287 in New Jersey.;2017-04-28 10:30:00;2 minutes;Shiny, silver disk witnessed high in sky above highway I-287 in New Jersey. On my drive home early from my job as a senior research laboratory technician on I-287 South in New Jersey, I caught a glimpse of a shiny metallic object in the sky.  The sky was crystal clear blue with not a single cloud in sight.   At first I dismissed it as a plane, but with longer examination I realized it was a slim, nearly-flat silver disk with no vapor trail.   It appeared to slowly hover to the South, then in seconds, it swiftly changed direction and zipped off to the East and completely vanished.   I noticed other drivers had slowed and were looking and pointing at the same region of the sky where I witnessed the craft.;40.4880487804878;-74.4544975609756
