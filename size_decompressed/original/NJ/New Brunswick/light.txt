Bright unnatural light filled the sky.  ((anonymous report));2019-06-05 22:30:00;15 seconds;Bright unnatural light filled the sky. Was driving north on the turnpike when all of a sudden a bright light filled the sky, almost as if a flash of lightning expect it was sustained for at least 5 second, pulsating.   Then after a short break the same thing happened again, but brighter.   No storms where in the area, so it wasnâ€™t lightning.
