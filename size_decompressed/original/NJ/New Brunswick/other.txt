At first, because it had an irregular shape, I thought it was a plastic bag floating in the wind (there was a significant breeze).  As it got higher, I thought it might have been a kite.  As the object kept rising, it also kept moving closer to me at a slow but steady pace.  I watched it the entire time and by the time it was directly overhead, it was flying about twice as high as the church steeple.  It seemed to be a cluster of metal objects which were very shiny and appeared to have shapes like large flat letters (N? S?) It almost looked like a cluster of mixed metal chairs or picture frames.  The entire cluster, about 10 feet in diameter, was rotating in different directions as it kept moving south. By this point I thought it might be some kind of remote control object or part of some kind of air vehicle that had fallen off.  As it passed overhead it made no noise (that I could distinguish from the general din of air traffic from above).   I gathered up my books and by the time I rounded the church, it was very far in the distance beyond the library. I pointed it out to someone nearby who works at the library.  He had been sitting on the front steps of the church but had been looking down until I came around.  We watched it together for several minutes and could see that it continued to rise and move farther south, rotating all the while.  Maybe it was someone's science experiment?;40.4880487804878;-74.4544975609756
