Boomerang shaped object over Central Jersey;2001-11-18 05:05:00;20 seconds;Boomerang shaped object over Central Jersey While watching the Leonids meteor shower I noticed a boomerang shaped object flying directly above me.  It made no sound and had no lights.  The surface appeared smooth, with no visible engine or tailfin  I couldn't make out the color but it appeared flat or matte, possibly gray.  The altitude of the object is difficult to gauge but based on the size, speed and  wingspan, from my perspective, it was larger than a 747, traveling 300-600mph at under 10,000 feet.  It looked like a giant boomerang, flat with a narrow fuselage/wings. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD));40.4880487804878;-74.4544975609756
