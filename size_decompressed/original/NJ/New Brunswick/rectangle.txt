I was heading north into New Brunswick NJ. from route 130 just coming off the route 1 overpass when I saw a rectangular object which seemed very large, (about finger length with the arm extended.) above the town. The object appeared more like a projection than a solid form, it was a very light yellow with a smaller square with lines thru it of a darker shade in the left corner of it. The object was there by itself (no airplanes) it was not moving. As I drove forward in traffic a tree blocked my view. I was stopped by a traffic light for 10 to 15 seconds by time I moved forward it was gone.;40.4880487804878;-74.4544975609756
