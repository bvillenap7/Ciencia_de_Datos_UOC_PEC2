((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the star, Sirius.  He describes its location and appearance perfectly.  Just a guess, however.  PD));40.4115670886076;-74.2385113924051
gigantic light over field;2005-03-14 10:00:00;3 seconds;gigantic light over field i was driving with a friend of mine on the garden state parkway and we looked to our right in an open field and saw a very low gigantic light. very low to the ground. the field is swamplands. the light was so big we couldnt make out a shape although we were going about 65mph.i slowed down a bit before the trees got in the view and couldnot see the object anymore.  it was just hovering as far as we could tell and about 75-100 feet off the ground. there was no blinking lights, no FAA lights, just one solid light. we couldnt believe it.;40.4115670886076;-74.2385113924051
Yellow, alternating lights that hovered in the sky for a few seconds then darted southward.;2012-11-04 21:00:00;Few seconds;Yellow, alternating lights that hovered in the sky for a few seconds then darted southward. This was after Hurricane Sandy and no one in my area had power. So it was fairly easy to see &quotlights&quot in the sky, which should have consisted of stars and aircraft (known aircraft). While I was laying in bed, trying to get to sleep, I noticed a strange pair of lights in the sky.  They were alternating like police lights, but they were a yellow color.  I did not think this was a ufo.  I thought it was strange, certainly.  But I thought maybe someone was in the courtyard (I live in an apartment complex) walking with a flashlight and that the light from the flashlight was reflecting off of my window frame.  However, the lights then did something I could not explain - they darted across the window within less than a second!  It's possible that it was not a UFO, but I don't know what else it could have been.  I'm curious to see if anyone else saw this.;40.4115670886076;-74.2385113924051
