Unbelievably large triangular shaped craft  with pale orange colored lights .;1999-11-06 18:03:00;3 minutes;Unbelievably large triangular shaped craft  with pale orange colored lights . two friends and myself were just settling into the jacuzzi when one friend noticed something in the sky. She pointed upward and stood up. We both looked up and saw a LARGE triangular craft going overhead at a extremely low speed. There was no sound . The lights did not blink . It was headed in a south westardly direction and seemed to be flying ina cloud or vapor like cloud.It disapeared as we tried to follow it. My friend there with me is former airforce and said it did not follow protocol with lights etc. no visibal signs of regulated aircraft. all we could say was Oh my God . I can't shake the image from my mind.;40.4115670886076;-74.2385113924051
