At approximitely 9:53pm, on the night of August 20, 2016, I went out back of my house to smoke a cigarette and looked up to the sky, as I always do.  As I looked I saw a dim light move across the sky, and at first I thought it was a satellite which I have seen numerous times.  As I continued to watch the object it suddenly became very bright as if a spotlight was turned on, only to dissapear into the sky as if it was never there.  The total sighting took around 15 seconds, while the brightest part before it disappeared lasted about 5 seconds.  The best description I can give on the location would be straight above the moon's current location and traveling in a horizontal direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Iridium satellite?

An orangey, yellowish, star burst kind of diamond light traveling from the northwestern to the Southeastern sky. WoW!;2019-01-01 22:54:00;5-10 minutes;An orangey, yellowish, star burst kind of diamond light traveling from the northwestern to the Southeastern sky. WoW! I went out to smoke a cigarette in the right corner of our deck of the back yard, while I was standing there I seen and witnessed an orangey, yellowish light that seemed to be traveling from the northwestern to the Southeastern sky.  I never in my life seen such a light quite as strikingly bright orange like it was, almost like it seemed to look much like a star burst kind of orange light.  It's very difficult to explain how it actually looked like maybe, something like straight out of, STARTREK. Very strange indeed and it made not one sound.  I was expecting to hear something.  You know, maybe a helicopter or some kind of airplane type of sound.  Nope, nothing of the sort.  Zilch, notta!  And, it moved with such grace not to mention that it only seemed to be five to seven or so hundred feet up in that night sky.  I thought it might have been a shooting star the way that it came into view but, no, just this magnificent bright orangey star burst kind of light that shimmered as if it we're a diamond.  I'm sorry, I couldn't make out a body or fuselage. I felt that I had little or no time to go get my parents to witness the event but, my luck had changed when Mom came to the back door to throw out recycling.  I called out to her, Hurry up mom, and come to where I am so you can see what I am seeing.  She replied, I can't move to fast or I'll fall.  But, she made it in time to see it traveling south bound out of sight. Wow!  What a way to start off the New Year.;40.0712634615385;-74.8396057692308
