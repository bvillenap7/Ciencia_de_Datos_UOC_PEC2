Cigar shaped flying object in NE sky over Burlington Township, NJ.;2016-07-14 18:00:00;5 minutes;Cigar shaped flying object in NE sky over Burlington Township, NJ Slow moving cigar shaped and flying over our development.  Saw it in the sky from my backyard, which is SW...the object was in the NE sky over the front of the house.  By the time I ran through to the front of the house it was miles away and and much smaller in the sky.  No way it could have gotten that far at the slow speed which was travelling.  When it was closer, I thought the plane looked funny at that angle...like it had no wings.  Then I noticed it was making a westerly turn and expected the wings to be revealed...but there were none.  That's when I went to the front of the house to get a better view in case I lost sight of it behind our trees.  (My house is only 30 feet long and I ran!!)  At first I thought it disappeared, but my husband and I saw it really small and very far away...in the NE sky...still moving very slowly.  Then it was gone.  There were no lights and no vapor trails.  Also, no sound!;40.0712634615385;-74.8396057692308
