I was an officer at the time and my dispatcher and I laughed at the first report until several more calls came in from different sources.  The woman who reported it was a mother of a friend of mine and she said that she pulled over with her husband in their car to watch it.  She described the UFO as 3/4 mile in length, lined with lights and that it disappeared as quickly as it came.  She was shaking and crying when she reported it to our P.D.  Her husband told her not to tell anyone because they would think they were crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.
