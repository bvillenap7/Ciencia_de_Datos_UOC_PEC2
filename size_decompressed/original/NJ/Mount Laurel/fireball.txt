Heading north when blinding flash occured which was followed by a golf ball sized fireball.;2000-09-09 03:30:00;3mins;Heading north when blinding flash occured which was followed by a golf ball sized fireball. I was heading north after crossing state highway 38 witch runs west to east.The time was approximately 3:30am. At this time an extremely bright white light filled my entire sight, bright enough so I could see shadows from the trees around me. The flash lasted 3 secs .I then looked up and saw a white-gold-yellowish looking ball, follewed by a blue tail.It also had what looked like smoke folowing the tail.The head was the size of a golfball.I saw this object for about a minute.It was moving south to north directly above my car.On the local news the following night, there were reports of a similar object over Delaware and Pennsylvania. ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports were received by the Franklin Institute/Observatory in Philadelphia and by news agenicies in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.  Some witnesses in the Philadelphia area reported that the object had corners, and that it stopped and was motionless in the sky for several seconds.  We cannot confirm those reports yet.

Laure;2012-10-13 21:45:00;1 minute;At approximately 9:45pm EDT tonight, I was driving home from work and spotted two orange light in the sky over Cemetary Road, Mt. Laurel.  These lights were approximately the size of about five bright stars put together. They were large.  They made no sound.  They flickered.  They moved  parallel to each other, one in front of the other.  I know what planes look like at night, and I am a pilot and have experience with aviation, having gone to an aviation college. These objects moved from South to North.  I witnessed this for approximately one minute or so.  I took out my I-phone and I quickly taped this.  I still have this video. I called TRACON over at PHL airport and they told me that there was no report of pilot report for this yet.  This is about 45 minutes ago.  I will report this now to Mount Laurel Police Department.;39.9456388059702;-74.905058955224
