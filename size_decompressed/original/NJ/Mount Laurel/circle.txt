Yet, after 15 minutes or so of watching it was clear this was no planet. The light would blink in and out. it would go dark and vanish completely for two to three seconds every couple minutes or so. i was very interested so i continued watching it. after about 25 minutes of watching this phenomena, the light blinked 3 times in rapid succession and on the fourth it stayed dark and never came back. From now on I'll be doing more night sky watching.;39.9456388059702;-74.905058955224
Bright white light around 5:50 pm observed in Mount Laurel, NJ.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-18 17:50:00;2 seconds;Bright white light around 5:50 pm observed in mount laurel nj. I was driving on Mt. Laurel road with my teen son and tween daughter heading towards route 38 and we were around the mt laurel library.  Suddenly a very bright white light, almost like the Sun, appeared in the sky.  It was so bright it lit up the sky orange.  I thought it was lightning, since it was raining, but no thunder sound followed.  Also lightning is linear zig zag, this was a circle.   Then I thought the power lines short circuited due to rain but there were no sparks or smoke.  It was over in less than a second.  There were other cars on the road too..some slowed down and one car stopped. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
