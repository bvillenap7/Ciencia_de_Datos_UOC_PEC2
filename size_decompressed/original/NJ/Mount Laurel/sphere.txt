My friend and I were driving North on the NJ turnpike near mile-marker 34 in south Jersey at about 7:45 in the evening on October 26th, 2014.  We saw a glowing green sphere suddenly appear above the treeline.  It just popped into existence. It then dropped in a steep angle behind the trees and out of sight.  The total length of the sighting was under five seconds.  The weather was clear, it was full dark, and we  both saw it within a second of each other and almost simultaneously said, â€œDid you see that?!  My friend is a business woman with years of Wall Street experience behind her.  I am a Registered Nurse.  We are both natives of New Jersey.
