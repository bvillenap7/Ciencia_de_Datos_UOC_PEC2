Laser detector activated on radar detector followed by doughnut-shaped cloud in otherwise completely clear sky;2014-10-06 14:57:00;1 minute;Laser detector activated on radar detector followed by doughnut-shaped cloud in otherwise completely clear sky Laser warning on radar detector activated exactly at 14:57pm while driving on Fellowship Rd towards South (just before crossing Rte 73).  Never experienced that warning before.  Doughnut-shaped cloud with vertical companion appeared immediately after that in South direction in an otherwise completely clear blue sky. Dashboard camera did not show any activity in sky, but it would have anyway been blinded by the sunlight's illumination from that direction.  Dashboard camera showed two vertical interference-like lines at exactly 14:59:47 upon entering Springdale Rd South from Church Rd that don't show up in any other recorded file. Location is sky would have probably placed the event within the Philadelphia Airport radar. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information.
