Ball of Light moved up from trees into the sky, stops and shoots off so fast it left a streak of light behind it.;1987-06-01 00:00:00;10 seconds;Ball of Light moved up from trees into the sky, stops and shoots off so fast it left a streak of light behind it. When I was 10 years old, and my brother was 8 we were in our beds one night and chattering on like kids do.  We had a big window where we could see the sky easily.   About a half mile from our house was the Ramblewood Country Club.  A very large golf course.   We were both looking out the window when a bright light moved straight up from the trees from the direction of the golf course and just stopped dead in the sky.  It just sat there glowing white light.   Then in a blink of an eye it shot off to the right so fast it made a streak of light behind it and it was gone.   We both saw it and ran into our parents room scared to death.;39.9456388059702;-74.905058955224
The light began to zig zag across the sky from left to right really fast.;2008-05-10 04:15:00;45 minutes;The light began to zig zag across the sky from left to right really fast. I just got home from doing a show in the city and was in bed with my partner.  While in bed we noticed outside our bedroom window a very bright light in the clear night sky.  At first we thought this was a beautiful bright star, really nice and bright in the sky. As we continue to look at it from the bed we both noticed that the bright light was beginning to move across the sky.  At first we didn't say anything to eachother but then I asked my partner, Baby, is it moving?.  My partner looked at me and said, OMG are you serious right now?  The light began to zig zag across the sky from left to right really fast and then suspend itself in the sky and moved directly up and down in a north to south direction. We got up from the bed and moved to the window and stared at this light and watched this occur for about 45 minutes or so.  The light continued to move down and toward the area of the house and we saw different color lights flash brightly.  At this point our hearts were beating really fast, we were all paranoid and scared because this is something we always read, hear and see things about but never thought it would be happening for real. We eventually got back in the bed and went to sleep but had to turn in the other direction away from the window in order to try to get to sleep for the night.;39.9456388059702;-74.905058955224
Brilliant green starlike light traveling downward;2017-06-11 19:35:00;4 seconds;Brilliant green starlike light traveling downward Looking downward while fishing, I noticed a  very bright reflection in the water.  Being quite familiar with this location, I immediately looked up to where this object was traversing the sky. The object was the size of a green pea at arm's length, and was a brilliant green color.  It had a thin yellowish white outer edge.  A twinkling star holds the closest resemblance.  It traveled from the north northwest to the south southeast.  The object traveled downward at a steeper angle than any meteor I have ever seen, and at a slightly slower rate of speed.  There was no tail, streak or sound. Conditions were clear with blue skies.  The sun had just dipped below the trees on the western side of the pond, but the taller eastern trees were still illuminated with sunlight.  It was behind those trees that I lost sight of it.;39.9456388059702;-74.905058955224
