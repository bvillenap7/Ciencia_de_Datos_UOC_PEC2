I initially thought it was a satellite  as it appeared stationary. While not seeing any movement for approx 45 secs, the light began to move NE.  I grabbed a pair of 7 x 50 binoculars and observed the lights as they appeared to flash randomly and in green red and white,  The object was fixed dead center in by field of vision, but would dart in unpredictable areas within my field of view and at great velocity.  I watched this for several minutes when the lights vanished what I would estimate over the ocean off of Long Beach Island;39.6999;-74.2633

It was moving in a slow, steady straight path then all of a sudden traveled further out into space until the object disappeared into the dark night. All 5 of us saw it happen. At the same time we saw an airplane in the sky and used it to compare the difference between the airplane and the unidentifiable white ball of light.;39.6999;-74.2633
