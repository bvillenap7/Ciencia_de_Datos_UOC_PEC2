First notice two lights widely spaced apart greater than width of planes that fly by.  ((anonymous report));2019-03-16 20:00:00;2 minutes;First notice two lights widely spaced apart greater than width of planes that fly by.  Saw the lights through tree line on garden state parkway south, by exit 63 at 8:35pm.  We noticed the lights were getting closer as we were driving by, a third light appeared outlining a triangular shape.  No noise occurred.  It looked like it was only flying about 100-200 feet overhead.  It crossed directly over the garden state parkway in our field of view as we were driving.  It made no sound.  Just three lights at each point of triangle and it was transparent.  It was roughly two hundred feet long by estimated 40 feet wide.  These estimations could be off due to perspective against the night sky.  It was both amazing and terrifying at same time.  It was moving relatively slow. 100% not plane or drone.
