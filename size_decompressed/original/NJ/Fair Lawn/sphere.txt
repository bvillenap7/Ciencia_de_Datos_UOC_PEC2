A large Frisbee-shaped craft high in the sky with a series of green lights pulsing from front to back.;1983-07-15 19:00:00;2 minutes;A large Frisbee-shaped craft high in the sky with a series of green lights pulsing from front to back. I don’t know why I never reported this.  It’s been so many years and I do believe I saw a UFO.  My Mom’s friend told her she saw it too--that same night.  I was walking down a street in my town in the early evening and looked up.  I saw something moving slowly across the sky and what was strange about it was that there was a series of lights pulsing.  They were, to the best of my recollection, green.  I am certain it was NOT a plane or a helicopter.  It was a truly amazing sight.  It was hard to see the shape but it seemed to be like a Frisbee.  It was fairly high up in the sky, so it’s hard to say how large it was.  The series of light pulsing seemed to be on the near the bottom or the side of the craft and were pulsing from the front of the craft to the back.
