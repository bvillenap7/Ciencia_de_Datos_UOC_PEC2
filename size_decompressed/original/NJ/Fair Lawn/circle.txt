2000 UFO sighting northern NJ suberbs.;2000-05-15 23:00:00;20-40 seconds;2000 UFO sighting northern NJ suberbs. First I would like to say that all my statements are absolutely true and I am sorry that I waited 3 years to file.  I will do the best I can to remember.  I served my country for 6 years in the Marines and have no reason or desire to decieve or waste scientific time.  I just think my account deserves to be included. It was a cool evening sometime in May of 2000. I was standing outside my friends house with a few buddies smoking cigarettes.  There was a total of 6 of us outside that night.  Sometime around 2300 in the Eastern sky a bright object appeared which resembled a very large star.  The light seemed to be coming out of the craft at a even and constant rate, so basically it was a ball of light.  Not like any aircraft I have ever seen.  And I have seen a lot, my MOS was 6060 flight equipment tech. Anyway what was really strange was the speed and angles that it was traveling for some strange reason the craft made several(3 or 4) rediculously sharp turns at angles approching or exceeding 90 degrees.  The craft covered a good deal of space considering it was at least 7-10,000 feet in the sky.  The thing I really hate to say is the fact that it sounds like many other UFO sightings I have heard.  Maybe we are not all crazy? Only myself and another friend so the objct. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  We have requested reports from the other witnesses.  PD));40.935;-74.1175999999999
