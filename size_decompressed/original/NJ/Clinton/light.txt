Lights over rt. 78;2008-02-11 21:15:00;5-10 secs.;Lights over rt. 78 I was traveling home from school the other night and I observed a strange light over RT. 78 in Clinton, NJ.  As i was traveling westbound right before exit 15 I saw a light traveling very quickly roughly 500 ft. in the sky.  The light traveled southwest towards the walmart shopping center then made a 90 degree turn and continued at a very high speed towards spruce run resevior.;40.6412;-74.9094
Satellite-like moving star with bright flashes every few seconds.;2020-07-11 22:00:00;1 minute;Satellite-like moving star with bright flashes every few seconds Watched what I assumed was a satellite, because it was a medium-bright star moving steadily from south to north as they usually do, but then it emitted a bright flash every ten seconds, which I have never seen them do before.  When it was directly overhead, the flash was dramatic and bright about the size of a nickel at arm’s length. I would love to know if I was simply seeing a satellite.;40.6412;-74.9094
Unblinking, low-flying, white light;2021-05-31 22:00:00;2 min;Unblinking, low-flying, white light Sixty year-old witness, alone in my suburban back yard, saw a light travel from East to West at small aircraft speed and altitude. No red or green positioning lights were present, which is what made the sighting unusual. Steady, white light, no blinking. Also, as the craft moved away, the white light was exactly the same as when it had been approaching, so it didn’t make sense that I may have been seeing a small plane’s headlight. There happened to be two satellites ( Space Station?) going far overhead at the same time. The kind that are very high and hard to keep your eye on.;40.6412;-74.9094
