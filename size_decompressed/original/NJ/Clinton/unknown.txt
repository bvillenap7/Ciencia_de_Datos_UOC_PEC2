Speeding Stars over smalltown Clinton, New Jersey;2008-08-03 01:45:00;20 minutes;Speeding Stars over smalltown Clinton, New Jersey Me and my friend took a early morning walk just bored out of our minds.   We sat down and looked up at the stars.  First I repeatedly seeing as if it was stars just zooming from one spot to another really quickly.  I mentioned it to my friend and I was like Ok Iâ€™m crazy never mind then I kept seeing it in different spots we were laying down with our heads facing southeast, looking to the north west.   Sometimes the streak of light was really long and very bright or it was dim and short, it varied.   The color of the streaks of light were from darkish grey to bright white to yellow orange.;40.6412;-74.9094
