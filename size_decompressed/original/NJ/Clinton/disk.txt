Disk shaped craft seen hovering over Round Valley Resovoir in Clinton, NJ;2003-06-08 00:15:00;30 seconds;Disk shaped craft seen hovering over Round Valley Resovoir in Clinton, NJ On the evening of June 8-9, I was parked in my car on the grounds of Round Valley Resovoir in Clinton Township, NJ when I saw a very large saucer shaped object appear for about 15 seconds.  It hovered for a few seconds and then darted behind a mountain at a steep angle.  It was definitely too large to be an aircraft.  I would say it was about the size of a football field.  It was very bright in the center and dimmer on the outside.  It was definitely not of this world.  I am a college educated professional and know what I saw.;40.6412;-74.9094
