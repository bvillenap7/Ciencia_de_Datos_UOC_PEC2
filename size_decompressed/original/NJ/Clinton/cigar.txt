Traveling to Pennylvania.;2010-01-05 16:00:00;3 weeks;Traveling to Pennylvania Hello  I am trying to find some organization that can help me find answer . I am working in mental health hospital and it will be stupid of me look for some help in the wrong place. For the last 3 weeks  I've been traveling  rout 78 from New Jersey to Pennsylvania, I noted 3 objects very high  altitude stick format always in angle position . Much larger then  any plane cause the altitude higher then  of the planes  flying on  this course. You can see it between four and five PM better because of the reflection of the sun what makes you positive that  it is not a plane. All you can see from panes on that altitude is small dots those objects are stick format in a more higher altitude. The objects are not together,  you can see one on the south,  one on the west and  other  north . I never saw it in lower altitude, it is always the same altitude and the triangle pattern position course. I saw other people pulled over other day and  looking  up but i was going to fast  to stop and have a conversation  to see what they are thinking and i don't see any report on the news or papers so i donâ€™t want to start the noise. Please post what you can find.  Thanks... New Jersey to Pennsylvania January 08 2010. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
