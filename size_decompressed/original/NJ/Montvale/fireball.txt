giant sparkling fireball falls from the sky and an incredible speed.;2008-02-24 03:52:00;12 seconds;giant sparkling fireball falls from the sky and an incredible speed. I have my bed next to my window and as I was trying to fall asleep last night while I was staring out at a star that was positioned to the northeast. Out of no where a large sparkling ball (much like a single firework but unimaginably larger) fell down from the sky flying low and sucked it self back into the horizon in one swift motion. It couldn't have been a plane the ball was too sparkily and very large-- traveling about the speed of a shooting star. I thought it might have been a giant meteorite or a comet but judging by its mass, even if most of it had burned up in the atmosphere, It still would have made a large noticeable impact where it had landed, most likely enough to get media coverage. I haven't heard anything on the news however, which leaves me with a blank answer for what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
