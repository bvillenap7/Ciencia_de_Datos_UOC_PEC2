ufo;2010-09-26 12:00:00;3 seconds;ufo This is my second sighting in 4 years.my job is right next to a major military complex in monmouth county.the first sighting was also at this location.it was a very cloudy day and there were breaks in the clouds where you could see the sky here and there. I happened to be looking at one of these breaks and spotted 3 disks travelling slowly together for about 3 seconds before the clouds blocked my view of these craft.my first sighting years ago the sky was clear i turned a corner walking and spotted a chrome like disk hovering several thousand feet in the sky, a disc i watched it for about 5 seconds then it zipped through the sky at an insane speed no sound no smoke no nothing just pure insane speed.it must have travelled 5 miles in a second if not faster i dont think their out there they are here.
