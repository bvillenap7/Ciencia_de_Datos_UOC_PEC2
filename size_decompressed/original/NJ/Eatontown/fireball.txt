Bright, very brief streak of light on Rt 18 North Near Eatontown.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2010-06-24 21:15:00;2 seconds;Bright, very brief streak of light on Rt 18 North Near Eatontown While driving on Route 18 North at between 21:00-21:30, a bright light streaked across the sky lasting approximately 2 seconds.  Initially, I thought it was fireworks but there was no evidence of fireworks displays in the area.  It also seemed to be very high in the sky.  The light was much bigger and more brilliant than meteorites that I've observed in the past.  Most likely, it was a larger than average meteorite, but I'm filing this report in case someone else observed the same event and can share a different perspective.  The light was bluish-green.
