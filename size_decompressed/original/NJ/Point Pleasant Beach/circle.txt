Green circular object over Point Pleasant Beach, NJ;2021-07-22 21:30:00;2 minutes;Green circular object over Point Pleasant Beach, NJ I was at Martell's Tiki Bar at Point Pleasant Beach on July 22, 2021. It was about 9:30pm.  There were fireworks on the beach. I heard someone behind me in the crowd say what's that?  I looked up into the night sky at about 70 degrees above the horizon. I saw a green circular object moving from south to north slowly. Then it stopped for a few seconds and moved back southward a short distance, then took off quickly to the north until I lost sight of it. At least 3 of us saw it. My friend said that she saw a blue flashing light on it. The object had a green glow but was not bright and did not cast light or beam beyond the circle. It was above the lights of the city where it was more dark. From my perspective it was about the size of a dime. The moon was full that evening and by comparison, it appeared the size of a quarter. It's hard to judge the altitude, but it was not low. I couldn't get my phone out in time to video before it was gone.;40.0833;-74.0618
