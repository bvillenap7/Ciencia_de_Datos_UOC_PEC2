I was driving up a hill on RT 517 and saw a big orange ball which kind of looked like fire.  It started then moved up right above us and stopped.  It was round and glowing, we got awesome pictures of it.   Then after about 5-10 min, the orange lighting just shut off.  It looked like it was high tailing away since we all saw it.   Then 30-45 seconds after we saw directly over the trees a black saucer flying into the horizon after it finally just disappeared!   We only got a picture of the orange round thing.  The black saucer was amazing but it flew away so quickly we couldn't get footage of it.;41.0804;-74.5972
