a zigzagging light crossing the sky;2003-08-15 21:20:00;5 min?;a zigzagging light crossing the sky appeared as a light moving across the sky in a northeasterly durection and then turned south. The light appeared to zigzag rather than travel in a straight line like an airplane would. At least once became extremely bright and then disappeared only to be seen again a moment later;41.0804;-74.5972
Consistent, bright lights in sky.;2013-10-30 19:00:00;1-3 hours;Consistent, bright lights in sky. Three times in the past week. @1900 hrs, a bright light appears in the distance, 220 - 240 degrees, WSW (azimuth) at 10 - 15 degrees (altitude). No planets or other stellar phenomena are expected in that quadrant. After about an hour (apprx 2000hrs), the light will begin to dip into the horizon, sometimes disappearing over Sparta, NJ. Other times, it begins to track northerly.  Disappears and re-appears north. On one clear day, last week, it could be seen in the north for quite some time. Powerful binoculars and USArmy field glasses fail to help resolve image. Investing in a powerful telescope.;41.0804;-74.5972
