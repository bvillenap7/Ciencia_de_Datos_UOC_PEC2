Large craft, silent and slowly moving forward directly above the car;1983-07-15 22:00:00;8 minutes;Large craft, silent and slowly moving forward directly above the car My mom and I(age 16 at the time) were driving home one night, then she said oh my God look at that. expecting to see a tiny light or two in the sky I could not believe what I was seeing,it seemed to be just above the treetops. there was a huge Space craft so large that it was hard to determin the shape because we were directly under it.In an instant I tried to reason with my self and try to find an explanation but what I was looking at was so amazing.I climbed out to sit on the window frame while the car was still moving down the Road.Colored Lights blinking along the entire bottom of the craft,My mother said look at the green lights and as I did I saw the set of two green lights that seemed to blink ,like a pulse,down the middle of the craft. It is hard to explain the pipe-like pattern that covered bottom.;40.8823;-74.2152000000001
