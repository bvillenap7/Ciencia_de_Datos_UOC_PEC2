It is red white and blue to the naked eye, but the camera did not pick that up.  We have pictures.  I am a Rutgers University graduate and I have studied meterology.  This is not a radiosonde.  It is somewhat cylindrical in shape.  Most unusual.  My entire family observe it every evening since it appeared 5 days ago.  Every night between 6 and 8 in the evening we watch it.  It will probably be there tomarrow night too.  I urge you not to waste time if you want to see this for yourself.  I personally guarantee that you will be as dumbfounded as we are.  This is truly a celestial mystery.  I estimate the altitude to be at about 15,000 feet.  My interest in this is purely scientic.  I want to know the truth.  Please contact me.  I freely invite you to my property to see this.;40.8823;-74.2152000000001
