Expanding green/blue light with strong but silent electric current cuts power off to building and street lights. ((anonymous report));2018-04-15 21:32:00;15 seconds;Expanding green/blue light with strong but silent electric current cuts power off to building and street lights I was dropping off a friend after dinner and as we closed our conversation, we noticed what appeared to be lightning in the sky on a rainy night.  However, the lighting flash did not end immediately the way lightening does, and the sky was not white.  Instead, we noticed the neon green lights to appear like a spotlight in the distance, converting the entire sky into a neon green/blue color.   As the lights turned brighter, there was an energy burst which shut off all the street lights and building lights like a domino effect.  The lights restored two seconds after the energy wave burst.  We kept looking back at the green/blue sky and quickly after the sky restored to its regular darkness.  The building electricity resumed, but the street lights took three minutes or so to turn on after the event. The event happened so fast and there was no audio whatsoever from the event.
