I watched it for a few seconds and as it passed over my car I caught sight of another object which was a very bright, silver colored object off in the distance beyond that plane. It was very high in the sky which was mostly clear and blue except for some very high white clouds. This object appeared to hang motionless just at the base of those clouds. It hovered at a fourty-five degree angle. I saw no lights or flashing from it and it appeared quite smooth. As I drove on I had to change directions and when I finally resumed driving north again I looked up to the same area in the sky where the object had been, however it was gone.;40.8823;-74.2152000000001
