UFO or spacegarbage, either way it was an awesome sight. The object was a rather large streak of green light that flashed half way across the sky.  It had to have been seen by a bunch of people because it was somewhere over somerville NJ, which has a big population.  I was driving on 202 heading inside of somerville when the event occured. It was in the sky directly above the road.  Anyone who was driving at around 10:00 on 202 had a great chance of seeing it.  It was pretty high up, but awfully big and bright enough that it grabbed my attention.  The driver in front of me even slammed on the brakes for a second.  But as quick as it came it also left.  The flash of green which had streaks of yellow and blue behind it only was around for about maybe two seconds.  It was pretty intense.  Im guessing that it probably was a piece of falling space garbage.  Or something like that.  But the thing that bothered me was the size of it. It was a rather large green blur of light.  And also that afterwords i saw a pair of helicopters in the area. This may not be related to anything that happened (whatever it was), but who knows. Plus the idea that it could have been a UFO is a pretty neat.  I believe in them. And I sure wouldn't throw out a ufo sighting as the source of the odd green lightstreak.  Im wondering if anyone has any further information on this possible sighting, there was nothing in the papers on monday or tuesday.  Maybe someone knows a bit more about it.;40.5859;-74.6832
