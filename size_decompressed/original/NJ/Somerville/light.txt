Seveal minutes later as we began disguessing what we saw, an enormous helicopter flew over my house with its search lights on, it flashed my house with it and continues on towards the direction in which we saw the object. **see summary for description** the only other thing i can add is that the light was the size of a star, it was white/orange colored and moved in the straight fashion of a controlled craft would do.;40.5859;-74.6832

It was a crystal clear night not a cloud in sight.   Now just to let u know Newark airport is about 30 min from my house.  I see planes fly over my house all the time.  These were further up and flew side by side with each other for about a minute or so then faded out.   Now being a constant observer of the sky, i can tell these weren't planes or satellites cruising around.  I know for a fact this was something unexplainable.   Two months ago i saw a shooting star fly across the sky. Immidiately after i saw the same similar lights.  1 flew east after that 1 flew west within 30 seconds of each other.  A coincidence im not sure.  All i can say it's just something i can't explain.   Out of all the footage i've seen between the news,you tube, and nasa footage.  I can truly say we are not alone in this universe.   I truly believe that one day we will have proof and contact with our distant friends from places far away.     Sincerely  just a regular guy observing really cool things up above.;40.5859;-74.6832
