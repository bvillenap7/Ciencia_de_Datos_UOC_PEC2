I am now a believer!;2018-01-10 22:33:00;2 seconds;I am now a believer! Never thought I'd be on here writing this in my entire life, but here I am.   I usually work overnights starting my shift at 11:00PM I walked out my front door around 10:22 PM waiting for my uber thought i saw something moving in the sky towards me, I looked up and right above me zoomed by a triangular shaped craft that had dim yellow lights trailing on both left and right edges of the craft on the underside, it passed right over my house, I would say about 1000-1500 feet above me, it was incredible to have seen, not scary at all but just mystifying and humbling to know that all the other people who reports such things are not crazy like i thought i was.;40.5859;-74.6832
