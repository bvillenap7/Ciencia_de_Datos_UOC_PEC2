NJ UFO?;2009-06-29 15:00:00;8-10 min;NJ UFO? Waiting for my daughter to come out of the Motor Vehicle in Somerville NJ, I just started cloud watching. After a few minutes, I saw, what I thought was a high flying plane or bird. I was amusing myself watching it go in and out of the clouds. Sometimes it never left the cloud it was in, which is what really made me pay attention. It was flying up and down and forward, never backward. I tried to capture the image on my camera but there was bright sunlight and it was causing too much of a glare. A short time later, a plane was behind it.. almost following. A regular craft. There was a marked difference in the way this one was flying in comparison to the first one. That's what made me think this was a UFO....then they both disappeared. I found this odd because we aren't that far from Newark Airport in NJ;40.5859;-74.6832
3 objects with lights, spotted in triangular formation while driving on RT 287.;2015-07-31 21:00:00;15 minutes;3 Objects with lights, spotted in triangular formation while driving on RT 287 Some very close friends of mine were driving (leaving Somerville).  We were on RT 287, coming towards Piscataway.   My friend who was sitting in the passenger seat spotted spotted a triangular form shaping with three circular light objects and so did I.  They didn't look like planes or helicopters (as so her husband thought) but as soon as we looked the circular light at the  tip of the triangular formation was moving fast and away!   We realized, as we kept driving, we saw them again, but only two this time and they seemed to be close, and I'm sure that no helicopter or plane would look at that close!!!  I'm not sure, but they were bigger, so that means they were closer.   I know what lights look like and those weren't lights, but there was a light that covered what seemed to be fast moving objects.  It had like a glow so to speak.  It scared the living crap out of me!!!;40.5859;-74.6832
