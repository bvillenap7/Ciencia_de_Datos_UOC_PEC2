2 spherical lights in the northwest sky  ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.  PD));2004-08-31 20:50:00;at least 5 minutes;2 spherical lights in the northwest sky Facing northwest, about half way up the sky, I viewed a hazy white object that seemed to have two spheres attached or were close together. It was quite large and easily visible with the naked eye. At first, I thought it was a plane coming through a cloud, with its two wing lights on. But it was a totally clear night. And object(2) also did not move for at least 5 minutes. I left my house for a few hours, and when I checked at around midnight in the same place in the sky, the light was gone..
