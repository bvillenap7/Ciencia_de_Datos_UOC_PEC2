About 700- 1000 feet ahead is a small lake called milton lake. The sky was clear and full of stars and as we were driving a we couldn't help but notice a small streak of light one might think to b a shooting star. But the light came to a dead stop for about 2 seconds, I mean this thin must have been going so fast I couldn't even begin to say how fast it could have been going. After the light halted for about 2 seconds it took off in a streak of light in a totally different direction, and then disappeared!  I'm no aviation expert but I don't think anything manmade could pull a manuever like that, so I am lead to believe it was some sort of u.f.o. I mean it was amazing to see it. I have seen shooting stars before and this was not one of them.;40.6105;-74.2813000000001
