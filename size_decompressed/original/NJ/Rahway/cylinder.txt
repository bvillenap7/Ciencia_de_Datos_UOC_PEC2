Vertical hovering Cylindrical shape object seen in Rahway New Jersey.;2021-01-11 10:30:00;5 minutes;Vertical hovering Cylindrical shape object seen in Rahway New Jersey. I observed a vertical cylinder shape object hovering a few hundred feet above ground. It didnâ€™t move for about a minute then it started moving horizontally then dropped altitude, hovered for another minute then began moving upwards. I took three pictures of it and decided to drive a few blocks to see if I can get a better look at it. After driving three blocks I lost sight of it and never saw it again.;40.6105;-74.2813000000001
