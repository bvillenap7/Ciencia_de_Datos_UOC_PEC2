Two stationary lights shone then faded out in the evening sky near Venus.;2001-01-23 17:40:00;15 seconds;Two stationary lights shone then faded out in the evening sky near Venus. During my daily fitness walk in a county park I looked up at the perfectly clear blue sky noticing that as evening approached the stars and planets were beginning to show. A short distance east of Venus I saw two lights close together about the width of my thumb held at arms length. The light to the right was brighter and faded slowly out. The light on the left faded and brightened a few times then went out. Both lights were stationary. Shortly after they vanished a commercial airliner flew over where they were. The lights were circular and had a pale yellow or golden hue. They were slightly less brilliant than Venus and had a softer definition with some haze around them. I am a fine art conservator with a keen sense of observation. I am also an avid skywatcher and have been interested in UFOs since my first sighting in 1967. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness may have observed landing lights on approaching commercial airliners, but that is a guess.  PD));40.6105;-74.2813000000001
Quickly moving bright light over Linden, NJ.;2016-07-20 23:00:00;7-10 seconds;Quickly moving bright light  over Linden NJ Date of sighting:  20 July 2016 @ aprox 11:00 PM EDT  LOCATION Linden NJ/ Staten Island, NY:  Viewed from Rahway NJ Duration: 7 to 10 seconds Weather: Sky was crystal clear, full moon. I was on my deck looking east from my house toward Linden, NJ. A bright white light appeared coming from the south (Raritan area) which is the flight path for approaching aircraft landing into Newark Liberty Airport.  The light was too fast for an airplane and too slow for a shooting star. The light suddenly stopped in my east view. It then took a completely vertical path, looped, came back down to the treetops/rooftops in my line of sight and then looped back up  vertical again.  It then disappeared on the last downward pass, spiraling as it descended. The approach of the object from the south was above the flight path altitude of the usual approaching aircraft.  I estimate itâ€™s highest  ascent was 2 to 3 times that altitude.;40.6105;-74.2813000000001
