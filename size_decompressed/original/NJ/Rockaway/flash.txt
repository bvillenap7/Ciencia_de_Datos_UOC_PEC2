I had been seeking a sighting my father told me about as a child, in Elizabeth somewhere around 1952-1953 that he is now very hazy on, when I came across the one in Rockaway on 3/3/2012.  I believe we saw the same blue fireball light as described at 20:10 EST. It was BIG roundish FLASH and came over us at the top of the hill on Stonybrook Road and Seneca Ave.  I remember blue light and seeing a BIG FAST MOVING FLASH fly fast overhead and as a teenager thinking that it was way too low, way too bright and way too fast and low to be a comet or meteor shower. It was a Monday night, and we were on the way home from a Scout meeting which usually began around 7pm.  We usually arrived home at around 9pm in an upper middle class neighborhood most likely either driving my father's Ford Taurus.   The time is approximate, but it was around 8:45 as we usually arrived around 9pm from Scouts. It was  big and I mean a BIG blue light that moved directly over us  VERY FAST over a wooded lot that was soon to be built into a new house.  There was a large blue flash then everything was normal but remember getting home somewhat later than expected, and my father and mother not mentioning anything of the time although this was less than a mile from our house, and we arrived later than usual at almost 11pm. Seeing that someone else saw this, now has me a bit shaken over 25 years later.;40.9241;-74.514
