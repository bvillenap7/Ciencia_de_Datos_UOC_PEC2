Two moving stars;2002-08-10 22:30:00;5 min;Two moving stars On the evening of Aug. 10, 2002, I received a phone call from ((name deleted)) who lives approx 10 miles away to go outside and look at 2 stars moving across the sky. Upon exiting my residence, I looked up in the n/e sky and witnessed two stars like objects moving across the sky following each other headed north. After about a minute the one object faded and disappeared. I called for my father to come outside when the other continued north until trees and houses blocked it. My father was present during the sighting and he figured due to its path and extremely high altitude it was most likely a satellite. About a minute later after seeing it disappear, there it was again now headed south. It was on the same course as before but now headed south. The next thing that occurred was when it was directly in sight it began to light up intensely, (about 5 times brighter than any star in the sky) then dimmed again. This might have been due to entering the atmosphere then exiting again. After watching travel halfway across the sky heading south, it then turned 90 degrees and went east towards NYC. Due to the light pollution from NY, It became very dim and lost sight of it. I am aware of flight patterns that cross the sky nearby, but this was too high in the atmosphere to be a commercial plane, no noise whatsoever, but who knows? I would like to know if anyone else had seen anything Saturday night. 3 witnesses/ 2 different locations;40.9241;-74.514
