Blue white fireball seen in WSW sky in NJ.;2012-03-05 20:10:00;seconds;Blue white fireball seen in WSW sky in NJ. In a WSW direction in the sky a giant blue white mass was seen plummeting toward earth.  It had a thick white tail like a comet.  I am a sky watcher and have viewed many meteor showers both on land and at sea.   This was the biggest mass I have ever seen.  It seemed to take a bit longer to fall than the average meteor.  I fully expected there to feel an impact but there was none.  It was near Jupiter as it fell and it was far bigger.  I am very interested to know if others saw this.;40.9241;-74.514
