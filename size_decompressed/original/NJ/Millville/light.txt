Bright light low on the horizon with eratic flight path and speeds.;2003-09-07 19:55:00;1 minute;Bright light low on the horizon with eratic flight path and speeds. I saw a light straight ahead while driving down Rt. 49.  It did not blink and did not leave any trails.  It was small and bright and at first I thought it was a plane.  It appeared to be right with the apparent height, brightness, and speed.  But it appeared to be going from S to N and so I thought it strange that I saw no blinking lights.  It then began to speed up.  (All of this took place in probably less than 90 degrees of sky and for the most part was at or below about 45 degrees.  I'm no scientist or astronomer, but have made these guestimates by thinking back and slicing the sky into pie pieces.)  Within a few seconds of it speeding up to the point where I thought no plane could go that fast, be seen, and not make a noise, it began a gradual, then steep sloping pattern. By this time I had pulled into a parking lot to a gas station/store that was very busy.  I had also convinced myself that it must be a meteor.  The way it changed speeds still confounded me, but the sharp downward turn that was almost a straight decent down reminded me of a falling star.  I still saw no wavering of the light and as much as I tried to see lights blinking, there were none.  If I had to compare it's brightness to a star I would say Regulus, but smaller in size.  It then began to slow down as it decended.  It made a swooping turn very low in the sky and then went back the way it came at at slower rate than when I had first noticed it.  There were some trees very low down and to the left which made it hard to see it much beyond the point I had first noticed it.  Even though I had probably made a nuisance of myself by pulling in slowing to the parking lot and parking at the edge near the road, no one seemed to pay any heed to what I was looking at.  All of this probably lasted no longer than a minute.  I was in the store a couple minutes and while I was standing in line I looked at the clock at it said 8:00 exactly. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) i wish to fix information that i screwed up.  i don't know what i was thinking when i posted it *sorry*  the date was actually 9/27/03 and since it was a few minutes before 8 i guess that would make the time actually 19:55?  i didn't know how else to fix it it but to use this form!
