I stepped outside and noticed aircraft traveling in the sky. From the angle I was sitting it seemed to be quite a few travelling.  My first assumption was that it was a military convoy since there are usually groups of 3-4 choppers that will travel through here during the day on occasion.  I noticed they kept coming.  I walked down the street about 50 yards to get a better angle and noticed that 4 of the aircraft were circling the sky.  They were triangler in shape with flashing lights.  These were probably planes since they had red and blue flashing lights and they seemed to be moving in a standard pattern.  Another one or two were definately choppers because I could hear them as they flew closer and farther away.  One of the objects, however appeared to be brighter than the others.  It also did not follow the same patterns as the other aircrafts in the sky.  It seemed to glow bright white without flashing lights.  It moved awkwardly and faster than the others but interacting with the planes.  It was more sphere like and there were no real flashing lights.  My first thoughts is this is a military training drill or it is an air search since there is an airport a few miles away but I have never seen this amount of aircraft circling the sky repeatedly for this long.  It's been almost an hour and they are still outside.  I've tried to take pictures and digital film but my night-shot mode is poor and the digital film just won't pick up the objects.  I'm sure this is explainable but just in case I felt I should fill out a report.;39.3667;-75.0308
