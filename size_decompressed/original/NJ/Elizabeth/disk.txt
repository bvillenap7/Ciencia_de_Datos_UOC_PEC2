I saw a huge disk w/ 2 big lights and several smaller lights around it.;2008-08-09 09:45:00;1or2 minutes;I saw a huge disk w/ 2 big lights and several smaller lights around it. I was star gazing with my brother and younger cousin. They ran to get sodas but I stayed. When they were gone I say a huge light thinking it was a plane. Then I saw it was like a disk shape with 2 huge lights and several smaller lights. It was dark but I could see its form and knew100% it was no plane. I yelled, Every Body Come quick. Hurry, hurry.... My cousin and brother saw it to and screamed in horror. But by the time my father came to see what it was, it vanished.;40.6661503703704;-74.2151355555556
U.F.O Spotted by teen, At night (21:03) Giving out 5 colors  or more of light;2008-09-19 21:00:00;15 seconds just about;U.F.O Spotted by teen, At night (21:03) Giving out 5 colors  or more of light 	(my age is 15)  So its a normal day like any other, i come home from school and i pass the day on the computer until 8:50pm (20:50) My mother asked me to go out and buy milk, as a quick errand, (21:02) when i walk out of the house and towards the corner store located about 4 houses away from mine. I look up to the dark blue sky and i see this big about blimp sized oval, there was a few stars around including an airplane, of course it couldn't have been a blimp because as i was so nervous my mind sort of sparked and was working faster then normal, i tried to identify the item because at first i really thought it was a blimp. It gave out a swooshing sound, that sounded like an airplane but not quite. When i stared at it for a few more second i notice there is no top that a blimp would have, which is the balloon that holds it up, It had about 5 different colors of light that the oval gave out, Orange, red, Blue, Green, and purple, some colors where flickering. As i just stare at it my heart begins to pound about 2x as fast, i thought to myself i have got to calm down, so i took a quick breathe, I could not identify the object at all as a known human built machine. It was Moving about half the time a plane would take to get from one place to another while watching it from the sky about 80 feet or so. I know defined it as a U.F.O. As i walk into the corner store i begin to look for a clock, it was 21:04, when i came out my heart still racing, i come home and try to explain it to my mother, but as usual i dont really think she believes me, she did however say things happen to people and its unexplainable but don't expect seeing it again as i told her that i was going out with the camera. i went out anyway and saw nothing, it really makes you regret not acting fast or having a camera even though its weird to do that i will always remember now that witness and proof is very important. I just really wish i had proof because frankly no one believes me. I don't know if anyone else saw it but this event surely changed my life 							- thank you for reading;40.6661503703704;-74.2151355555556

Observed a black disc shaped object moving slowly and occasionally emitting a sparkling light.;2020-09-05 15:23:00;1 minute;Observed a black disc shaped object moving slowly and occasionally emitting a sparkling light. On September 5, 2020 at 3:23 pm I was stopped at a traffic light at the intersection of Ikea Drive and North Avenue East when I had observed a black object in the sky in front of me at about 1,000 to 2,000 feet in the air. The shape seemed to resemble a disc. What caught my eye was that the object occasionally emitted a very bright sparkling reflective light, as if the object had mirrors reflecting the sun light. The intermittent sparkling light would last a couple of seconds. The object appeared to move very slowly south of my location. I had lost sight of the object when video was taken. Upon viewing the video at slow motion and zoomed in, I could see the object ascending at a high rate of speed and sharply turning towards the west and accelerating at hypersonic speed and out of view. The video at around 3 seconds shows the black object to the left of the utility pole just above the lowest wire and then it travels to the upper right side of the video frame! and out of view. The total event lasted about 1 minute.;40.6661503703704;-74.2151355555556
