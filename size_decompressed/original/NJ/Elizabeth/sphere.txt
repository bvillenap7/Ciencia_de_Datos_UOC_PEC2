Spheres in New Jersey;1997-02-01 23:00:00;15-30 sec;Spheres in New Jersey Having a cigarette out in back yard I walked and looked down driveway and saw what I thought to be a balloon, sort of skin toned flying out of neighbor's ( across street ) driveway in a north easterly direction I walked to left side of house ( as I faced back door and in a South direction ) and did not see object but did noticed what looked like a satellite flying in the same said direction, I thought maybe a coincidence. until recently.;40.6661503703704;-74.2151355555556
Wish to see more of those things!!! (UFO's)...;2000-11-25 01:25:00;1 minute;Wish to see more of those things!!! (UFO's)... I was going home to NY from my girlfriend's house. As I was driving on the NJ Turnpike North approaching the exit for Elizabeth township, I saw this huge blue light approaching at a very fast speed illuminating the highway. When I slowed down to look at it, it just flew very low to the ground without making any sound. It was flying right next to the highway light poles. Again, no sound. It then slowed down, hovering in the air and then it took off at a very high speed rate. The whole thing was brightly illuminated by a blue light. I am pretty sure that the Newark airport airplane controllers must have seen it on their radar. If this helps you in any way, thanks very much for reading my article.;40.6661503703704;-74.2151355555556
orange spheroid seen flying over elizabeth NJ floating north to south & vanishing after approx 12 minutes;2006-04-02 17:55:00;12 minutes;orange spheroid seen flying over elizabeth NJ floating north to south & vanishing after approx 12 minutes a bright orange orb seen overhead at approx. 150-250 meters off the ground.  At first I though it was toy ballon that initially appeared over a tree but instead of rising upwards it kept a steady straight line flight from north to south as I watched it crosss over the local YMCA in Elizabeth New Jersey. It was not a balloon but a deep orange colored orb that was moving slowly until it dissappeared out of sight.  This sighting is the second time I have seen this orb in almost the same setting in elizabeth, as I saw it last year.   My theory is that it may be a weather instrument launched out of Newark Airport which is close by and I am contacting the FAA offices at Newark Liberty International to see if this might not be the case.   Yesterday the Sunday the 3rd was a day of heavy chemtrail spraying over Union County which I have documented on film.  Unfortunately I did not take any photos of the orb since I was too engrossed in watching the object move slowly across the sky as I was documenting the cloud anomalies from the chemtrails. The orb passed out of view and then I could no longer see it as it seemed to just vanish in its journey south.  The other time I saw this orange orb-like object last year the same thing occurred as it was there and then seemed to vanish out of sight, although it was floating much higher in the sky then. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that chemtrails are, in fact, just normal contrails behind high-altitude aircraft.  PD));40.6661503703704;-74.2151355555556
3 white orbs moving together against clear blue sky;2008-02-24 00:00:00;30 seconds;3 white orbs moving together against clear blue sky It was the last week of February 2008 in Elizabeth, NJ.  I saw 3 perfectly round white orbs flying together. They were pretty high up and were moving at a moderate speed across the sky. Then the one on the right made a sharp right and a couple of seconds later the one on the left made a sharp right. This lasted about 30 seconds before I lost sight of them behind a building. I got a good look at them. They were definitely not birds, planes or balloons. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
