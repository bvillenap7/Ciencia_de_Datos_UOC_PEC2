Extremely loud noise hovering over our house for over 20 minutes.;2013-01-03 04:10:00;25 minutes;Extremely loud noise hovering over our house for over 20 minutes. At around 4:10, I was woken up by my mother who was terrified about a strong noise outside.  I tried to brush it off as an airplane.  We live close to the airport, but the noise was more intense and seemed to get stronger but did not move away it simply hovered above our house for over 20 minutes.  It was a very strong noise that at times seemed to intensify it sounded as if a plain was lending on our house but it just hovered.  We were too scared to venture outdoors.  I called 911 but was told it was not an emergency and they put on a recording directing me to call local authorities.   The noise was terrifying and unlike anything I had ever heard the sky was lit up but I could not tell if it was because of the moon which is waning.;40.6661503703704;-74.2151355555556
