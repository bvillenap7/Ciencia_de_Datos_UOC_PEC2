I looked up and above me and heading south, very low in the sky, was a brilliant white, cigar-shaped object.   It appeared to be rather thick in size, about an inch to an inch-and-a-half in width and the length of my arm.  On the end of it was a circular ball-like shape that seemed to go from a violet to blue to red and then it just went poof it disappeared.  It actually looked like a lollipop but the stick would be very thick.  It was very clear out and there were many planes in the area, including orange in color which I have never noticed before.;40.6199;-74.3110999999999
Cigar shaped brightly lit craft glided well below a departing airplane.;2010-07-10 22:17:00;Less than 1 minute;Cigar shaped brightly lit craft glided well below a departing airplane. At 10:17 pm (est.), a cigar-ish shaped, oddly lit UFO passed south to north.  The UFO had red, white and blue lights.  They were in no particular pattern or familiar arrangement.  Some of the lights were elongated, some were simply points of light.   The craft did not bob or weave or change course at all.  It glided perfectly in a straight line until out of view. An airplane taking off from nearby Newark International Airport was heading sort of east to west, and passed over the UFO.  The plane, even though still low from departing off from Newark, flew much higher than this UFO.  The only sound I heard was that of the plane accelerating. I'm hoping the plane flying above the UFO reported it, or maybe ground control asked the pilots if they saw anything?   The two witnesses are male adults, mid-30's in age.;40.6199;-74.3110999999999
