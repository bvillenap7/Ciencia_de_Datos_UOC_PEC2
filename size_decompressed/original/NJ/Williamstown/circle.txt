((HOAX??))  We didn't believe in UFOs untill now.;2009-07-06 17:30:00;1 hour;We didn't believe in UFOs untill now. We were jumping on my trampoline and when we looked up we saw what we thought was a star.  We didn't think anything of it until it started to slowly dim and th en light back up. Then we realized it was a different color then all the rest. We started to star at it and realized it had 3 balls of light circling it. Then we saw it start to move eventually it stopped.  We continued staring and realized it had changed color from when we first saw it. Next, we tried to get a picture of it but the object would not show up on the camera.  We then were so freaked out we went inside my house. We even saw airplanes go past it and it looked nothing like them.;39.6659;-74.9658
