I thought it odd that a plane was coming that low and from that direction.  As I watched I realized that it wasnâ€™t moving like a plane coming towards me, but rather it was moving up and down and side to side.  The light was sometimes red and pulsated.  I got my binoculars to see if I could get a better look at it.  Finally I went inside and went to bed.  Around 3:30 am  a friend woke me up to ask if I saw the light in the sky out front. I was surprised to learn that it was still out there. I got dressed and went outside and sure enough it was still there. We watched for a few minutes when we saw it travel north and disappear.;39.6659;-74.9658
3 Stange objects  seen scanning an airplane in New Jersey.;2014-07-30 22:00:00;5 minutes;3 Stange objects  seen scanning an airplane in New Jersey. We collectively saw 3 strange multicolored objects hovering.  Then one of them shot out a white light then disappeared.  The second one disappeared then the third one slowly faded off into the distance.   A commercial airplane in the area of the objects was lit up by the white light that shot out of the UFO, as if it was scanning the airplane.  There where multiple witnesses who seen this happen. After a few minutes helicopters flew in the same direction as the objects. We where looking north-northeast.;39.6659;-74.9658
