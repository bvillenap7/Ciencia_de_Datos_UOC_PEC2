While sitting on back deck relaxing and looking up for stars a rectangle object about the size a mid-sized car cruised over my home.  It was solid flat black with no lighting whatsoever.  I could see a cylinder looking head or helmet protruding on top which appeared to look down at me.  After blinking this object flew past my line of sight.  The object did not make a sound and appeared to have a visible distortion around its edges.  The area was between a tree on my left and my home on the right.  Visible window of less then 20 feet from he ground view between tree and house.  It looked as if it was a large flying carpet with a large can on top. It was flying just above the trees so size is accurate.  ook some time to process what I saw.  Research on this type of object has come back empty.
