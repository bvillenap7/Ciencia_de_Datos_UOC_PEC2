Metallic egg craft with a shadow circle orb around it.;2017-08-08 06:53:00;15 seconds;Metallic egg craft with a shadow circle orb around it. On the morning of Wednesday 9. I was driving to work at approximately 6:53 AM. As I was exiting the highway to go over the overpass. I looked up to the sky way up in front of me and this object caught my eye immediately. It's seem to be about a mile away. I quickly determined that it was not moving.  It was not a plane or helicopter or anything I've seen. It was very very still.  It wasn't very big.  If you held a dime in front of you it looked that big, but mile away. The belly of this object was dark.  On the top of the roof of it, I could see the sun reflecting off it.  I could tell that the roof of it was metallic. It was shaped like a saucer but more rounded.  The strangest thing about it was that it had an orb around the craft.  I could see the space between The craft and the black shadowy orb that and in-circled it. I only had about I only had about 100 yards till I had to make my right turn.  The rest of my drive to work had trees that blocked my view from further seeing this UFO. I wish I had stopped right away to take a picture.  I was mesmerized by this site.  I couldn't stop on the overpass anyway and I only had a few more minutes to get to work.  It was a really cool sight to see.;40.9864;-74.1112
