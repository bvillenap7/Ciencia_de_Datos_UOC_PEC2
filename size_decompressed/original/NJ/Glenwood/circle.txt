I was outside of a friends house looking at the waxing moon and discussing differences between stars a planets.  Planes are common here, as the Newark Airport flight approach patterns cross our area.  We noticed to our west a plane with an unusual color was approaching, it was an amber to orange.   We then started to discuss the fact that it did not have any blinking lights, at which my friend said thats not a plane.  It was not moving at any unusual speed dining the first 30 seconds of watching it, but it approached the and past the moon about 5 seconds of travel, it stopped.  At which I declared to my friend that's not a plane, it is not moving.   It stayed stationary for about 10 seconds and it made a 90 degree turn away from us and just move away from us until the light just disappeared.  From the time it stopped it did not move across the sky it just faded until the light was no more.   The night was partially overcast, it travelled from the west to the ea! st, initially it came from a lightly clouded area into a clearing where the moon was.;41.2367;-74.4936
