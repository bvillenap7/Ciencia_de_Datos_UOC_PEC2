Hudson Valley-New Jersey-Large Sighting, No Hoax;2000-11-02 19:50:00;6 minutes;Hudson Valley-New Jersey-Large Sighting, No Hoax Tonight, my father and I witnessed a very large, disc shaped object, hovering over, or near the town of Cresskill New Jersey.  The object was too large to be man made, and moved over the northern valley, from east to west, doing less then 40mph.  I would have to say by my line of site, the disc shaped had to be roughly 1000 feet over the tree line.  It was very brilliant, and also had a blinking white light at the top. I hope you find this e-mail in similarities with many others from the same area and time frame.  If so, I'd like to know if anyone else saw it.  Please contact me. I'd like to know if anything else was reported. Sincerely, ((name deleted)) Cresskill New Jersey;40.9412;-73.9644
