When we looked closer. . . the objects were white, circular, and then several more appeared out of nowhere.   As some appeared then the others would disappear.  There must have been 20 to 30 of them.  More appeared as we watched them head east.   They circled around each other and would disappear and then more would appear.  One turned from white to red, to green.  It lasted for 10 min.  It was incredible.;39.9111;-74.1469
