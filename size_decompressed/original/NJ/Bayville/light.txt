Orange lights.;2016-01-01 00:10:00;1 - 1:30 minutes;orange lights Just after midnight, went outside to walk my dog.  Saw an orange light in the sky, traveling north to south.  Usual air traffic is east west.  Moving very fast.  It passed directly overhead.  As I turned around to follow it, I noticed there was a second orange light in front.  They didn’t appear to make any noise.  (There were fireworks from the New Year’s celebration going on.)   Also there was a cloud cover and they were definitely under the clouds.;39.9111;-74.1469
Elongated light with aurora beams going downwards to bay an jutting side to side very quickly.;2020-03-14 02:00:00;4 hours;Elongated light with aurora beams going downwards to bay an jutting side to side very quickly Elongated flickering light with some blue in it hovering in place then at times jutting quickly side to side.  As it was jutting streams of aurora lights beamed downwards.  It was to the east an most likely hovering over the bay.  I watched it for 3 hours then went inside.  It was still in sky when I went in and at that point the beaming aurora lights stopped.;39.9111;-74.1469
