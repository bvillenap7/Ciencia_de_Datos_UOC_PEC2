Two red fireballs, so close then shot up and disappeared.;2012-11-10 19:00:00;3 minutes;Two red fireballs, so close then shot up and disapperaed. It was unbelievable, two orange red, look just like slow moving close fireballs that were low and then proceeded upwards following each others motions like a video game then shot up and disappeared.  And the next one did the same.   Amazing! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.9111;-74.1469

They were semi low in the sky and flying right behind each other. Then all of a sudden a third one came out of nowhere and followed the first two. They didnt make any noise in the air and they were almost circular in shape and all lit up red. As quickly as they came they were gone. It was amazing!;39.9111;-74.1469
