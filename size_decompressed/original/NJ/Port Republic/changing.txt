Watched for a minute and realized it did not move, then saw another at the same level apart from it.  Kept watching them from different areas of the house and yard for over 20 - 25 minutes - they never moved, just changed light shapes and got brighter and fainter. Tried to see them through binoculars,but not any light was picked up.  Then they were gone.  Also, when I went outside to see better there was a very eerie sound that kept repeating.  It was nothing I have ever heard before and was very creepy.  Just monotone, not quite a word, over and over.  It creeped me out;39.53;-74.4902
