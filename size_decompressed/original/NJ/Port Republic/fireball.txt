Bright red glowing object in Port Republic, NJ (small town);2011-05-28 21:15:00;15 seconds;Bright red glowing object in Port Republic, NJ (small town) My boyfriend and I were driving.  He spotted the object first and I saw just about a second later.  It was quite high up in the atmosphere.  It was glowing bright red and glowing very brightly.  There were no flashing lights, it was just glowing.  I immediately hit the brakes on my car to get a better look and possibly a picture, but as soon as I did, it stopped glowing and just became a red dot in the sky.   Then, it seemed to take off faster and disappear behind the tree line.   I drove up to a clearing in the road as quick as I could, but the object was gone.;39.53;-74.4902
