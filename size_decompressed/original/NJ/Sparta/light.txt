5 large glowing red/white lights traveling close together;2012-12-24 20:00:00;60 seconds;5 large glowing red/white lights traveling close together We, a family of four, saw 5 large glowing red/white lights grouped very close together in the night sky.  They were not traveling in an obvious formation but seemed to be traveling together.     A light snow had just started to fall.   The lights were not brilliant but more hazy and of the same brightness.  They slowly faded out, one by one.;41.0286999999999;-74.6429000000001
Cluster of bright orange orb like lights in the night sky.;2014-04-27 22:00:00;5 minutes;cluster of bright orange orb like lights in the night sky 4-27-14 At around 9:45pm my girlfriend and I were driving and she pointed out a bunch of orange lights. She asked me what it was.  When I looked I saw about 40 or 50 orange lights in the sky, which at first glance looked like lights on a mountain, almost like a ski slope all lit up.  But I knew there was no mountain there, it was the sky. When I looked at these strange lights at first they seemed to mimic the star pattern, I thought I saw the big dipper but then I looked at the actual big dipper and realized these were not stars at all.  The objects were bright orange and moving into formations and making maneuvers that no earth like aircraft is capable of making.   We pulled the car over and got out to get a better look without crashing the car.  That’s when I noticed these objects start to disappear.  It’s like they almost just vanished into thin air.  By the time I got out of the car and got my camera on my cell phone out all were gone except for 2 or 3 of these objects.  I managed to ca! tch them on the video but you barely make out what I was looking at.  We were both so freaked out about what we just saw that you can hear the panic in our voices on the video.  Trust me this video does not do what we saw justice, and I wish I could of clearly captured what we seen in full.  I literally thought it was an invasion because of how many of them there were.;41.0286999999999;-74.6429000000001
While driving I noticed 30-50 orange orbs in the sky that moved in Z formations and then vanished.;2014-04-27 22:00:00;5 minutes;While driving I noticed 30-50 orange orbs in the sky that moved in Z formations and then vanished. Tonight around 9:45pm while driving down a wooded back road with my boyfriend, I noticed a cluster of orange lights in the sky.  At first I thought it must have been lights wrapped around trees on a hill until I realized they were moving back and forth in Z light motions.  There must have been 30-50 of them in the sky at least.  They looked like bright orange orbs and were moving in random motions and directions.  They were all close together. I sped up in my car down the road to get a closer look.  Trying to think of a logical explanation for them, I thought maybe they could be stars. I  then pulled my car over to attempt to video tape them, but when we got out of the car they all began to vanish.  They literally completely disappeared within seconds.  We managed to get the 2 or 3 of them that were left on camera, but moments later they were gone too.;41.0286999999999;-74.6429000000001
