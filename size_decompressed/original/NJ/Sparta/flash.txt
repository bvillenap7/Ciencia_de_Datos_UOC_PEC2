2 Flashing WHite Lights Over Sparta New Jersey, Changing Direction and Moving Very Fast;2006-07-05 01:00:00;3 hours;2 Flashing WHite Lights Over Sparta New Jersey, Changing Direction and Moving Very Fast At first it looked like it could have just been blinking lights from a plane. But the lights were moving WAY too fast to be a plane. We were staring out a window at them and they would blink and then totally show up in a different spot, they were moving incredibly fast. Also, just when you thought it was going straight it would change direction and go backwards or go left then right. It was as if the 2 lights were playing with eachother. We tried to think of what they could have been, but there's no way to explain how fast they were moving and how bright they were and how they changed direction. Also everything was totally silent, you couldn't hear anything. It also looked at one point that the object came down to tree level and dissapeared in the trees. It may have landed. but it was very far away, we couldn't tell at all. The next morning we told our neighbor he is a retired military officer at the local arsenal (Picatinny) and he told us he sees the lights all the time over the lake. And he cannot explain them, he knows of no secret tests at the base which is (about 25 miles away.) He pretty much had no idea what they were, he was just glad he's not crazy and other people have seen it too. Please if you experienced a similar sighting let me know, I'm really interested in this whole thing.;41.0286999999999;-74.6429000000001
