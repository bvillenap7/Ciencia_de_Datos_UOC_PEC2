12 starlike, silent,slow moving , erratic pattern, yellowish/orange color objects, eventually fading out one by one.;2001-07-15 00:30:00;approx 1 min;12 starlike, silent,slow moving , erratic pattern, yellowish/orange color objects, eventually fading out one by one. At approx 0140 on 7/15/01 in Port Reading NJ. Looked at NE part of sky and observed about 12 or so lights in an erratic formation, moving silently & slowly to east. Lights were about the size of a star and had a yellowish/orange color. The erratic pattern changed slowly until these lights faded out and disappeared one by one in no particular order. I am not good at estimating height in the dark but it appeared to be higher than a personal aircraft(Cessna)would fly. Witnessed by 5 people, each in a different location (we were at work). We communicated what we were seeing via 2-way radios.  Also at this time a jet was on approach to Newark airport and I wonder if they may have observed these lights. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the time indicated above by the witness to be an estimate.  We have corrected the time to 0030 hrs. (EDT).  PD));40.5716;-74.249
