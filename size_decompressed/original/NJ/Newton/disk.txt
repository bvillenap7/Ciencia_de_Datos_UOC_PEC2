((anonymous report));2016-07-01 11:05:00;5 minutes;A disc flew in a circular pattern and took off, all the while dropping flare-like remnants. A disk with lights that seemed to flash and shimmer sporadically flew in a circle for about a minute and then set off away from our vantage point.   As it flew away, we spotted dimmer red lights, almost like a flare but a softer color, that seemed to fall from the disk and disappear as they fell.;41.0711000000001;-74.8068000000001
