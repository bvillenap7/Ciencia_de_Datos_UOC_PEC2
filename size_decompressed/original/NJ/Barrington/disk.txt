I was waiting for the bus and saw this strange silver, shimmering disk with blue lights around it.  I was baffled and frightened.   I am confident it was not a plane.  I know what I saw, and it was not any type of plane.  It moved in an unnatural way hovering and then shot straight up at an astounding speed.   However after it left, I realized I missed my bus, and I was ten minutes late for school.  And have been having nightmares of waking up at night and seeing a strange beings at the foot of my bed.   This is not a hoax so please don't think it is I'm not making any of this up.;39.8651;-75.0564
