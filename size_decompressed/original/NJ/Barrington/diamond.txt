I was driving across an overpass on Clements Bridge road, overtop of highway 295, when I saw a round, bright white light through the passenger window about the size of a dime over the highway.It was hard to estimate the altitude.It moved very slow, swaying and dipping around.Suddenly,I couldn't see it anymore.I then made a right turn on Atlantic avenue and saw it again on my left. It changed color very slowly,kind of gelling from white, to a pinkish red,then back to white.Then it stopped moving and the light went out.I got out and stood by my car door. Because it was overcast and nightime,the street lights and such created a dome effect under the clouds.I could see the silhouette of the object below the clouds.It looked like a diamond on its side with the back 1/4 cut off.It was very silent. I did listen for engine noise,I made sure of that.At this time I was  about 1/2 mile from the highway,there was no traffic noise to confuse it with. The light was off for about 6 or 7 seconds.It then came back on white,which took up the whole shape of the silhouette.It then started moving again, away from me in the same slow,swaying fashion.I watched it travel toward Haddon Heights until I lost it in the trees.;39.8651;-75.0564
