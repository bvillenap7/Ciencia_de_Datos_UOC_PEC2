Seven red / orange fireball lights hovering in formation.;2012-09-02 20:00:00;3 minutes;Seven red / orange fireball lights hovering in formation. My husband was driving home down our dead end road when he noticed a number of fireball (red / orange) lights to his right, in the North/Northeast sky (in the area of the Pleiades.)  He pulled over and exited his car to get a better look, the fireballs appeared to be hovering in the sky and coming together in formation.  A neighbor pulled his car behind my husband's vehicle, exited, and asked &quotWhat the hell is that?&quot  In complete awe my husband answered &quotI have no idea, never seen anything like it before!&quot   My husband got back into his vehicle drove the few yards to our parking lot, exited his vehicle a second time, looked up and could see only one of the red/orange fireballs remaining, as it headed off up into the sky in a Northwest direction.  Tonight's weather conditions are mostly cloudy, winds East/Southeast 5 - 10 miles per hour.;40.855992139738;-74.1534423580783
2 strange orange glowing lights in the sky over Clifton, NJ;2013-07-30 22:00:00;3-4 minutes;2 strange orange glowing lights in the sky over Clifton, NJ Around 10:00 PM on July 30, 2013 I saw two orange glowing lights in the sky over NJ. They were moving slowly eastward following each other.  They were flying relatively low at first, but gradually increased their altitude.  Then, they stopped for several seconds, and one after the other flew upward very quickly and vanished from my sight.  They did not make any noise. I was able to observe the strange orange lights for 3-4 minutes before they disappeared.  I do not believe in UFOs, but this was definitely not an airplane, a helicopter, a balloon, or anything that I have seen before.
