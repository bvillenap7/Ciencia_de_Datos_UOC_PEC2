Pulsating lights over Northern NJ;2001-03-10 23:30:00;2 hours;Pulsating lights over Northern NJ My fiance and I were driving home from a party on Rt. 80 East in the Parsippany area when we first noticed the object in the sky.  It appeared to be, at first, an elongated string of lights.  The size of the object was difficult to assess due to its distance from us.  As we continued home, we tracked the object as it headed east towards New York City.  My fiancee got a good look at it at one point when it was directly to our north side and said it appeared to be cigar-shaped, describing as looking like a butter knife when light is reflected off of it.  Upon arriving home and stepping out of our car, we continued to watch the object as it hovered well off in the distance, quite possibly over New York City.  Again, the distance was hard to estimate.  When we looked back towards the west, we were startled to see that 3-4 other similar strings of lights were hovering almost directly over our position but far up in the atmosphere.  We went inside to further observe the original craft, which still hovered in the east.  Its lights seemed to pulsate/strobe in intensity and change colors (red, blue, green, white).  These objects (3-5 on average) have appeared nightly in our sky now and there has been a dramatic increase in plane and helicopter activity since their initial appearance.  We live near Teterboro Airport, but a lot of the air traffic we have seen is NOT conventional or commercial airplanes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witnesses may be looking at a twinkling star, airliner landing lights, or perhaps some other normal phenomenon.  We do not suspect UFO activity, but we are not certain.
