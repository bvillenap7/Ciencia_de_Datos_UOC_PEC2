B2 Bomber/Flying Wing aircraft.;2013-11-29 21:10:00;20 seconds;B2 Bomber/Flying Wing aircraft. I walked outside on this night to look at the stars.  Only a couple of minutes later I looked behind me and saw what seemed to be a plane.  It had no lights on and moved slower than usual.   As it approached, I realized the lights still weren't on and there was zero engine noise.  It was totally silent.  There was no fuselage section or tail.  The shape resembled a B2 bomber but lacked the jagged edges in the back.  It was a flying wing shape.   It was a dark grey color and had what looked like four equidistant lines like armament racks along the wing. It flew over MSU University area in a southern direction.  I tried to watch it further but it blended in with the sky so well I lost my tracking sooner than I thought I would.  About 5 seconds after it passed over me a regular small passenger type jet followed a few hundred yards to the left of it.  It seemed like a coincidence but maybe they were flying together.;40.855992139738;-74.1534423580783
