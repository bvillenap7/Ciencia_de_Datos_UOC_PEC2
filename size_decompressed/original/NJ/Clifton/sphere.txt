I call my wife, she saw it slow and hovering towards the eastern sky.It was visible for about ten minutes. Around 4 pm I  was sitting hearing the Mets on the radio, when I observed a sliver ball coming from the north to south east.It was against the clouds it looked sliver, but with the blue sky it was white. I call my wife and my son's godfather ,they could not tell what it was. I went up to get my binoculars and saw the object. It had rings like Satrun. My son came to the house a hour later and we saw it again in the same place. I came outside at 6:30 pm and saw it in southern sky for 10 minutes,it went out of sight.
