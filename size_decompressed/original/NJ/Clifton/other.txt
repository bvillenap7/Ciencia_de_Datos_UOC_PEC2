It appeared to be over the eastern portion of Clifton when I saw it then getting the attention of my girlfriend at the time and my son, 17 I believe, at the time, all of us stood fixated on this very different looking object.  Different because I've never seen anything shaped like this in any of the images put forth on any media. Basically and simplistically, it appeared to look like a drifting, bright, shiney steel garbage can. I'm not trying to be funny. It seemed to be traveling I would say about 30 miles an hour approximately a half mile or so from our point of view. With the sun's reflection it's top appeared either had a series of brilliant lites or these were reflections. Vertical indents going around the side is what made it appear as I've said, a garbage can and what would have been the lid may have been for observation. With the distance, it's size, and sun reflection I could not make out much more. I dubbed it the flying garbage can because that was exactly what if appeared to be but of course we all know they have no system of propulsion. At the speed this was going it definitely seemed to defy gravity. We watched it head toward the city of Paterson, NJ and at a point where we might have thought it lowered it's altitude large trees then blocked our view altogether. We were quite dissappointed. So that's it in a nutshell - I/we will not forget that one there was a long time when any of us went outside we always looked for our floating garbage can.......it certainly was unique.......

Luminous line seen in New Jersey sky.;2013-09-09 20:15:00;~1hr+;Luminous line seen in New Jersey sky. I am unsure if this qualifies as an unidentified object, however I did see a strange phenomena in the sky.  At approximately 8:15pm on 09-09-13 I saw what I can best describe as a luminous line in the night sky.  It was as far as I can tell a perfectly straight line, which from my distance must have been extremely long (mile?).  It appeared to be virtually motionless despite changing cloud currents near it.   Around 8:45pm it began to fade and slowly became obscured by cloud cover.   At the onset of the event I called my mom who also confirmed seeing it.   I attempted to take a photo of it with my cellphone and digital camera.;40.855992139738;-74.1534423580783

PLEASE POST THIS FORM INSTEAD.  SAME TIME PROVIDED.  (PLEASE DISREGARD OLD FORM POSTED AT:  Sunday July 25 2021 at 13:31:33)  I EMAILED A VIDEO LINK USING THE WRONG EMAIL BEFORE AND IT NEVER REACHED.  I attached links in this form that can be posted and will also try sending links through email again.  PLESE POST THIS FORM INSTEAD.   -   UFO AND ALIEN.   UFO VIDEO *1 at high altitude: blue line of light.  Stationary 1 hour. *2 at low altitude: dome roof, straight bottom, mostly straight sides.  Emit a slight red glow when stationary, and a bright red glow when moving.  Both these objects each once emit two bright white lights from one side going up that start at the bottom and vanish slightly above the dome.  During the white lights the light illuminated objects reflected some light and became brighter, but at night usually appeared black with a slight red glow.  Silent.  Maybe* a perfume like smell in the air.  Stationary 1 hour.  LANDING VIDEO (light reflected from garage windows before and after interaction.) *I think these low altitude UFO landed because I also took video and photo of something almost transparent that is only seen in specific lighting moving and interacting with objects the same week, along with other reasons.  Maybe clothing that bends light around objects.  ALIENS VIDEO AND PHOTO *illuminated by light coming from above (especially their leaning forward back.) *dim direct light that is behind them and shining on them. *sometimes a light or glare at their head height walking. *completely transparent in other situations. *did not trigger infrared sensors. *knees usually bent forward. *longer and wider arms than a human. *elbow bend at it's hip height. *large hands. *hands almost touch the ground. *hunching forward. *wide torso. *no neck was visible. *wide head. *5 or 6 feet tall. *can run quickly. *walked using rear legs, and not arms. *they were frightened easily. *they opened fence and house doors (witnessed by my mom also.) *familiar with my street (maybe because I placed some pictures on the outside table that it looked at while I recorded it then I walked outside to hand gesture, or the many other times I went outside at night.) *red lights also on video before and after it interacted with the pictures I placed on the table.  They are not hostile.  I was not afraid of them.  I got close to one on many occasions purposely.  After a while I changed my sleep schedule, and stopped actively trying to record them, and haven't heard or seen anything recently, but my mom recently said the fence door was opened, she closed it worried the dog will run away if it was let out, and then she said it was opened again shortly after.;40.855992139738;-74.1534423580783
