Higher than descending airplane into Newark BUT lower than ascending airplane out of Newark.  Much smaller than aircraft.   At first assumed it was a bird but the altitude remained consistent.  Black, no lights but a definite haze around the object.   Its movement was very steady and measured as if on cruise control.  Was traveling southwest near Route 46 in Clifton.  Shifted about 20-30 degrees but maintained south-bound route.   Observed for about 30 minutes while standing in front of a house along with three other family members.  It was still flying when I left. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.855992139738;-74.1534423580783
