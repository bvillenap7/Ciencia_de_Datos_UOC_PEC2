UFO Tears Through Clifton NJ Skies Silently and at Lightning Speed.;2004-02-01 12:30:00;5 Seconds;UFO Tears Through Clifton NJ Skies Silently and at Lightning Speed. Just for the record I wasnt sure the zip code I do not live in Clifton.  Anyway I was in the car with my cousin (non-believer) and he pointed out to me the object. He said jokingly of course is that a ufo and laughed at me (believer) I rolled down all of the windows in the car to listen and there was no sound. Any aircraft that was so close to our car would have made some noise. Especially be cause I live near an airport so the sound of planes flying overhead is common. It flew passed us and it was out of our vision in under 10 seconds but I got a good look at it for 5 seconds. Due to the winter's sun glare I couldnt see anything very good other than a very bright shiny disk.;40.855992139738;-74.1534423580783
