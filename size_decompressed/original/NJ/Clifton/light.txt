Bright light!!;2013-10-10 00:00:00;<1 minute;Bright light!! I do not know if this was a UFO sighting for sure but my husband and I don't have any other explanation to what occurred last night.  We live in a 2 family home, second floor.  Our bedroom is located on the backyard side of the house, away from the street.  We had all of our home lights turned off.   We were in bed and talking about our weekend plans when all of a sudden there was this incredibly bright yellow light that appeared out of no where.  It was our window bright as can be disregarding the fact that there were blinds and open curtains.  Sure our curtains were open but  this light was just an unexplainable bright yellow color, it filled me with much fear.   Unfortunately my husband was given his back to window but he also noticed how bright our room appeared and of course noticed my petrified expression.  Out of fear, I closed my eyes and hugged my husband as hard as I could of course, this did not allow him to go see out the window  When I opened my e! yes again the light was gone.  My husband and I were in disbelief to what had just occurred.  I asked him if he saw the light and his comment was how can you even miss it.  Now we went over ideas maybe it was the moon but we know that is not the case we had cloudy skies last night and our moon was definitely not in its full state.  We thought maybe a car?  But that was debunked given that we are in the second floor and heard no cars also as soon as the lights went away my husband checked outside the window and there was nothing!  Everything was silent,  No noise, no people, no airplanes.  My husband and I always have our curtains open and not once have we seen anything like we saw last night.;40.855992139738;-74.1534423580783
