My friend and I were outside in his back yard in Clifton, about to head inside the house, when I caught a white glow just over the tops of some trees.  I stopped to look, thinking it was the moon, when I realized it was not.  He looked too, and we discovered that it was about the apparent size of the full moon, and the same pale white, though more blimp-shaped.  It had flashing white lights at the top and bottom.  It moved very slowly, and we walked out into the street to trace its progress.  We were able to view it for approximately 15 minutes as it headed south-southeast, and though we had no binoculars or telescope, we saw it clearly enough to be convinced that it was not a blimp (all white, no advertising, and it seemed to be illuminated by itself), nor a weather balloon, nor any conventional aircraft.  It was also NOT Venus, or any atmospheric disturbance!  We are both rational, logical men (and had not been drinking), but neither of us could come up with an explanation for what we saw.;40.855992139738;-74.1534423580783

I thought it was the moon at first, but it did look very strange so I kept staring at.  I noticed that it tended to slowly move left and right.  By the time I saw its behavior there was no dought in my mind that this was indeed a UFO.  My girlfriend also witnessed the object as well as my brother.  Both admit that it was not the moon, it was moving, and it did have an oval/saucer like appearance.  I recorded three short vids of the event.;40.855992139738;-74.1534423580783
