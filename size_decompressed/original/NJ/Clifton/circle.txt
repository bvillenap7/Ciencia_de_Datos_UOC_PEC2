I looked up and suddenly saw a large circle of white lights…stationary above the house at a low altitude…approximately 5 thousand ft… just hovering there, silently.   I tried to call others out to see it, but they made jokes and never came outside.  It remained there for about 5 minutes, then disappeared from my view in a split second. Lights out.;40.855992139738;-74.1534423580783

Very bright object, the size of a penny or a nickel when held in the hand, &quotfloating&quot over there.;2017-10-05 05:30:00;10 seconds;Very bright object, the size of a penny or a nickel when held in the hand, &quotfloating&quot over there. When I woke up, around 5:30 am, I looked out the window and saw a bright object that looked like the moon, and the size of a penny or nickel when held in the hand, standing there.   Initially I did not make much of it, one way or the other.  But then it hit me that it might be a UFO.  All of a sudden, it was gone, but it did not go away, it just disappeared, like a light that is turned off.  It was still rather dark and I could not see whether or not there were any clouds in the sky.  But when the sun came out, I realized that there was not a single cloud in the sky.  Evidently, the object had just disappeared, like a light that is turned off.   This took place in Clifton, NJ, to the west of New York City.  (You can see the city from my apartment.)  I do not know exactly the duration of the incident, because it was already floating over there when I woke up.;40.855992139738;-74.1534423580783
