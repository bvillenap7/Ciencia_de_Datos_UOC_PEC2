White spec of light high up in sky that brightly flashes & disappears;2010-06-14 22:15:00;30 seconds;White spec of light high up in sky that brightly flashes & disappears You have a report in your database, dated 6/14/10, time 22:15.  Located in Monroe, New York.  I live just south of there on Greenwood Lake, in Hewitt, New Jersey.  I am a believer and I frequently read your site for updated reports.  I just read the report mentioned, and have to tell you, I saw the same thing that night, same time.   I sit outside at night on clear nights, watching the sky for shooting stars, etc.  I've seen satellites before and thought I was watching one that night, when the same thing happened as mentioned in other report.  I watched the satellite come south to north, heading towards Monroe, NY, and then it flashed brightly and disappeared.  It was simply a white spec, like a distant star, until it light up bright & was gone.  I thought maybe the satellite was so high up, the sunlight bounced off it.  (Is that possible from north NJ?).   Anyway, I found it interesting to see the same report here.  I enjoyed the sighting that night & forgot about it the next day, until just seeing the report today.   I've seen many shooting stars & satellites over time, but never one that started as a white spec, moved quickly like a satellite, but then flashed brightly & disappeared.   Thanks.;41.1729;-74.3791
