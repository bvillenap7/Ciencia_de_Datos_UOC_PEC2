Reddish-orange light that slowly disappeared;2011-12-31 17:15:00;10-15 seconds;Reddish-orange light that slowly disappeared A bright orange-redish light traveling southeast fairly low altitude and way to slow for airplane, being a plane would simply drop from the sky at the rate of speed, grew brighter.   After the object flew directly above my head and I need to turn around to view it, the shape of the object appeared, circular and a matte black finish.  The light which appeared to be in the back of this object slowly and steadily became dimmer and the object itself much more visible.  Before I knew it, the object vanished into thin with no evidence of it being there in the first place. No noise was every produced from the object and there was no contrail, the exhaust from jet engines.  Always was a believer in this sort of thing and always wanted to be a person who had an experience like this.  Needless to say it was the most amazing site I've ever noticed.;40.3318;-74.055
