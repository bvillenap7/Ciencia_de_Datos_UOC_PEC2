Further west from us and directly above at 12 o'clock was a very shiny reflective mirror or chrome colored object. It was a perfect blue sky with no clouds or obstructions. It was clear to me that it wasn’t a plane because it was not moving. Me, my wife and my 16-year-old son all saw the object. As I began to pull over to get a better look and take my phone out, it completely vanished right before our eyes. My wife’s best explanation was a mylar balloon but at the distance and altitude and size, it would have been too big for a mylar balloon and she also couldn’t explain how it disappeared in an instant. We also immediately ruled out a plane or military jet because there was no movement or exhaust trail.  We were en route to an apple orchard in Colts Neck, NJ which was another 2-3 miles west, closer to where the object appeared. When we arrived, as we were parking, we spotted a single fighter jet scrambled to the area directly above us. We also noticed the fighter jet was flying at an unusually high altitude, much higher than we’ve ever seen before.;40.3318;-74.055
