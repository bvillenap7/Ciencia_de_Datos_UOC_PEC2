Bright object in sky changes direction in a split second;2005-09-07 17:30:00;3 minutes;Bright object in sky changes direction in a split second While outside in the backyard with my dog, I had noticed that the planes were flying pretty low as they were heading into Philly. I watched them for a bit as they slowly made their way to a westerly direction and the airport. I happened to look to the south and saw a bright object, that I thought was a high flying plane, moving at what I thought was pretty fast for a plane. I moved a bit to the grass taking my eyes off of it only until I moved and the object that was once moving in an easterly direction was now moving in exactly the opposite direction. This was my first experience with something like this and almost doubted what I was seeing until I thought it through and realized what it was that I saw. After the object had changed direction from E to W it continued in the westerly direction until it was obscured by the trees in the neighborhood and I could no longer follow it.;39.8855216666667;-74.9066583333333
