Father and son see large bright orb with aura around it;2020-08-27 20:47:00;5 minutes;Father and son see large bright orb with aura around it My son told me he could see a huge bright light in the sky out of his bedroom window left of the moon.  There were no stars out, so he was a bit curious and asked me to go look at it. I could definitely see what he meant and it was large and brighter then anything else. From what I could see it looked was an orb that had an aura around it. I pulled out my phone to take some pictures and 1 video.  The object seemed to move a little, but mostly stood still in the sky.  It stayed there for about 6 minutes and then faded and was gone. I was unsure of what I just witnessed until my son and I reviewed the images. The images clearly depict how much brighter this thing was then anything else in the sky. It also shows the object illuminating light from it.  When reviewing the video you can see what seems to be a circle within a circle moving or pulsating.  Itâ€™s quite amazing! I was in the Air Force and grew up near McGuire, so I am very familiar with what planes & helicopters look like at night. This did not move and did not make any noise. I have the footage to prove what we saw and I would like to find out more.  I hope others in the area also witnessed this event.;39.8855216666667;-74.9066583333333
