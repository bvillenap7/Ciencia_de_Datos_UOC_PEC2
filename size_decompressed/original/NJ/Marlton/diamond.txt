Diamond shaped object with red and green flashing lights.;2020-08-17 21:30:00;1.5 hours;Diamond shaped object with red and green flashing lights. I noticed a very bright light in the southern sky, quite low.  I observed for maybe 30 seconds, and asked the other person what that light was.  The pattern was diamond-shaped, with approximately 5-6 lights, the top one being very bright.  The object was still and there was no sound (like a jet or helicopter sound).  We observed this for about 2 -3 minutes. Suddenly, the object moved in a westerly direction and the lights changed to green and began flashing in a sort of chasing pattern.  Then they changed to red and green, then all red-still chasing/flashing. The object moved very quickly to the west and disappeared from view.  I went to the front of my house and observed it still moving to the west-crossing Route 70.  This all happened in about a five minute time span. About 10 minutes went by and the object returned and again, remained still.  We observed this for about 2-3 minutes and then the lights changed again to red and green, and the object farted off in a north lay direction.;39.8855216666667;-74.9066583333333
