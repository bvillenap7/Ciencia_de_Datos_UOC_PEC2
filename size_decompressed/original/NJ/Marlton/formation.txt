The lights appeared at first glance to be nothing more than commercial air traffic, but following extremely close to each other, and clearly at the same altitude.  I watched this formation for three minutes.  A small red blinking ball of light was leading a cross shaped object, and the third object was shaped like the bracket key on a keypad, flying with the two small appendages towards the ground and at its sides.  The cross shape blinked alternately red and white.  The bracket shape blinked at the same time on its appendages.  One blue, the other white.  The small red object in the lead, blinked red with some white to it.  This small object also seemed to shine a faint white beam in front of it and moved to the left and right.  As it flew in this arcing pattern, the last object flew above the second cross shape and maintained this position for fifteen seconds.  The bracket shape then slowed below the speed of the first two, and sank back to its original position.   The last two objects were the size of a quarter at arms length.  They must have been at high altitude because i did not lose sight of it behind any ground based structure.  It just flew far away and became faint.  The sky around this event was clear.;39.8855216666667;-74.9066583333333
