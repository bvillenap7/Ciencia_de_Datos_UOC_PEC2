I looked up to see if we were going to have a storm or a few drops and i spotted either an eagle or hawk flying/drifting in circles.  This bird was a couple hundred feet above me, distance making the bird look smaller it was still identifiable. Then out of nowhere a black UFO started flying thousands of feet higher than the bird. It was daylight with light grey clouds just minutes before the drenching rain.  The UFO was flying straight then made an instant sharp left then a sharp right then didn't move for a few minutes and flew straight for 2 seconds and disappeared. The UFO was a dense black triangle.  It looked like an arrowhead with the 2 sides longer than the base.  The UFO had no visible lights, it left no trail and made no noise whatsoever. From the distance it was too high to be an airplane and the UFO was much bigger than any airplane, including military.  Airplanes at a lower distance look much smaller than this object that was extremely higher than any plane could fly.;39.8855216666667;-74.9066583333333
