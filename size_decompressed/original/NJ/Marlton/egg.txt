Bright egg shaped UFO  seen by 4 people;2008-01-12 15:30:00;10 minutes;Bright egg shaped UFO  seen by 4 people January 22, 2008 	 Being a nice day I thought it would be a great opportunity to take down the outside holiday decorations. After doing so I went right into raking up the Yard. While raking the side of my house I noticed an odd bright egg shaped object above the elementary school behind my house. At first I thought nothing of it but after watching the object change altitude and location in the blink of an eye I ran to the front of my house and yelled for my wife to come outside. My son and his friend came running over to find out why I sounded alarmed. I pointed to the object in the sky. My sons friends mom who had just dropped her son off stopped the car to find out why we were all looking up in the sky. When I pointed to the object she asked in an astonished cracking voice “what is it”. We stared at the UFO in amazement for what had to be 5 to 7 minutes. During this time the object stayed in the same spot. The UFO then climbed in altitude straight up and out of sight. After coming to grips at what we had just witnessed we realized that this UFO had to be very large because it was higher than any aircraft we had ever seen and was still being seen as larger than ten or more houses and as bright as a mirror reflecting the sun.;39.8855216666667;-74.9066583333333
