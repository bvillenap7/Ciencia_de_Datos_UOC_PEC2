High flying object seen traveling at a high rate of speed.;2002-09-13 11:48:00;7sec;High flying object seen traveling at a high rate of speed. Object was traveling at a high rate of speed from the south west to the north east.  It was very high in the sky, so high that its shape could not be seen.  I could not hear any noise.  It was very bright white in color.  Flying in a very straight line.  There was a very high plane laying down a chem trail traveling in the oppoiste direction.  That is what I was looking at when I noticed this white object.  It was a very clear day with a high sky and no clouds.;39.8855216666667;-74.9066583333333
At 8:50pm there was an orange/red object with smoke trailing behind moving through the air from W to N, then it disappeared.;2019-09-21 21:00:00;10 seconds;At 8:50pm there was an orange/red object with smoke trailing behind moving through the air from West to Northwest then it disappeared.  This may have been a meteor burning up,however eactly 10 minutes later we saw what looked like a tiny dim moving star traveling in a straight line, it suddenly got larger and flashed an extremely bright white light that slowly dimmed to a tiny deep red dot and continued traveling for about 5 seconds until completely disappearing.  This object was traveling West to East.  I am completely dumbfounded.  I have seen satellites and this was definitely not a satellite.  Both objects were traveling horizontally, they were not falling to the ground.;39.8855216666667;-74.9066583333333
