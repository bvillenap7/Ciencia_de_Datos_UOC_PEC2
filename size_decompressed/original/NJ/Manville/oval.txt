Strange lights flying oval.;2017-11-14 07:35:00;30 minutes;Strange lights flying oval. One large oval was floating for 15 mins then flew very fast across the sky.  The left side had three red lights, the right had four white ones.  Behind were other white lights 5-7 in equal distances across the sky.  There were also eight air planes that were very evident. I saw a similar thing?  Last year in Hillsborough, NJ, one town away. Mind you, my mother had text me, and asked about strange lights, she had been down the same road 15 minutes before us, she says she thought that the object was following her.   The object was visible for almost the rest of our ride, but it didnâ€™t seem to move until it was directly over the mini airport.  It flew very very fast.;40.5365;-74.5962
