4 moving lights at a high altitude spotted over Manville NJ;2012-02-17 19:10:00;5 minutes;4 moving lights at a high altitude spotted over Manville NJ I observed shortly after 7PM on February 17, 2012 a line of four objects (pin pricks of light) moving through the Constellation Orion for the size and distance of the objects they were moving at high rate of speed in a constant formation ( one behind the other).  They could not have been commercial Airlines due to their apparently high altitude almost looked as high as a satellite.  I also do not believe they were satellites, because of their linier formation.  I do not know what I witnessed.  They defiantly were not Airliners.;40.5365;-74.5962
