NJ UFO sighting;2008-04-03 22:48:00;30 seconds;NJ UFO sighting I was letting my dog outside my back door last night. As I stood in the doorway I noticed a very bright string of lights in the sky. They both flashed quickly and raced. Its hard to explain, I have never seen lights do this before. They where red lights. I also noticed a green light when the lights flashed off. This green light was not on the same strand of lights as with the red. I new this was not an airplane or a blimp. I could see the shape of the craft. It was similar to the disc type I have seen on TV and pictures over the years but it was a bit different. The disc was a bit thicker and not as flat. Is the only way I could describe. There was also a section on top of the disc as well. It looked to be made of some type of metal. It was low enough and close enough that I could see it clear as day. I also noticed  rather then flying in one direction, it seemed to hover and move side to side slowly, like a zig Zag. I watched this for about 20 to 30 seconds until it moved to a point where the house located in the lot behind mine had blocked my view. I called my mother immediatley. She has seen one over a cornfield at our old house about 20 year ago. This one did not look like the one she had seen. Considering how low this was, and how busy the area I live in is, I would definately think someone else saw this. There is a major airport located about a 45 minute drive from me so I do see many planes regularly however I know this was definately not a plane. However about 1 minute or so after I had seen the ufo there was a place in the same area. I dont know if this is somehow connected but I found it ironic at the time.;40.5365;-74.5962
