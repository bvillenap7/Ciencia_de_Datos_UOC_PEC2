moving light in the sky that brightens and dims, also darts occasionally;2004-06-03 23:15:00;1 hour;moving light in the sky that brightens and dims, also darts occasionally I live on the north side of town. From my porch facing west I saw a light that seemed to move slightly and change in brightness. It was on my left. It appeared to be still, then drift. Then it darted very quickly to the side, then back. As the hour passed it seemed to drift northwest, the light got smaller, but still varied in brightness. Around 24:12 it finally faded out of sight still moving west. Planes in and out of Newark pass over often. I don't know how they can't see this thing.;40.5365;-74.5962
