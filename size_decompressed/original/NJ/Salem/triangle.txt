Triangle ufo seen up close with binoculars in southern New Jersey.;2014-01-20 23:25:00;35-45;Triangle ufo seen up close with binoculars in southern New Jersey. 1/20/14  I have worked 12 hour nights for almost 3 years now.  I am an avid night sky watcher (meteor showers, planet conjunctions, satellites spotting, comets, I.S.S. passings, etc.), so I am quite familiar with normal night sky sightings. On the night of January 20th 2014, I saw something I've never seen before.  As I was walking out the back door of my workplace to smoke a cigarette at 11:25pm EST, I first noticed the moon about 25 degrees off the horizon straight in front of me. It was the first clear night we've had in at least a week.  As I was looking at the moon a bright light traveling northeast caught my eye.  This light was traveling pretty much in the same location from my vantage point as the moon so it was easy to see.  My first initial thought was that this bright light was the I.S.S., so I ran to my truck 10 feet away and grabbed my binoculars to look at it.  I put my elbows up on my truck so I was steady and found this bright light through my binoculars.  What I saw as one solid bright white light with naked eye turned out to be a triangle shaped UFO, with 3 lights. I could not believe what I was seeing.  I watched it for 30-40 seconds as it traveled away from me. The details of this object: the front light of the triangle was a huge solid white light. It did not change color or blink.  The back 2 light were the same size but were flashing at random it seems from, white/red/blue.  The elevation was probably a little higher than normal helicopter traffic.  Although, since it was dark it was hard to tell. I saw this thing clear as can be through those lenses. I'm not particularly happy I saw, everyone I've told has laughed at me, thought I was joking around, or just don't believe me.  But, I stand by my story, I know what I saw.;39.5567;-75.4541
