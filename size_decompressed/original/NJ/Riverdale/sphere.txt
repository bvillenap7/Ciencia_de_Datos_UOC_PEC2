Yesterday at approximately 4:40 pm I was traveling northwards on Interstate 287 in Morris County, New Jersey. Low-hanging storm clouds covered the entire expanse of the sky, but no rain or lightning was evident.  I must have been approaching mile marker 50, when a bright light appeared in the storm clouds directly ahead of me, brightening––for a moment––the clouds immediately surrounding its source. The source of the light soon emerged from the cloud covering: it was a glowing orb which I saw descending  to earth in a straight path. Within seconds, it had disappeared from view behind a hill.  By my estimate, it must have made impact no more than a mile from my vehicle. Numerous others must have witnessed the event as well, as the highway was heavily trafficked. I am inclined to believe that I witnessed a rare instance of ball lightning.  Nevertheless, I am still reporting the event in the hope that others may also share their stories and that a more detailed picture may emerge.;40.9902;-74.31
