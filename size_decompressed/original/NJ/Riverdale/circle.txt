PD));2017-03-08 18:30:00;15 minutes;Bright white light, circular object that never moved and way above any flight patterns.  Was there for over 15 mins It was way above any plane path. It never moved. It was extremely bright in a circular shape. We were walking thru Pompton Lakes but the object was over Riverdale, or maybe even Bloomingdale. We were walking for over 15 minutes and planes were passing in all directions but this object never moved. My husband seems to think it was a star but it was too light out and the moon was just starting to show.;40.9902;-74.31
