Bright Orange Orb.;2014-06-03 23:30:00;10 minutes;I live in Northwest New Jersey.   On June 3rd, 2014, around 11:30 at night, my mom and I looked out the window, just out of curiosity to look at the stars and to our amazement we saw a bright orange orb West of us glowing above the tree line.  It was unlike anything we had ever seen before.  It was bright orange and extremely big.   We then proceeded to go outside to watch it.  We looked at it for a good 5-10 minutes and then went inside.   About a half hour later it was absolutely no where to be found.  We kept looking outside to see if we could find it, and it completely disappeared leaving us extremely confused.   We are HUGE believers of ufos and believe that is what we saw that night.   We wanted to report this to you so that more people can be aware of the alien phenomenon going on around the globe. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS/FIRST REPORT VIA E-MAIL)) Hello.
