I was young, about 6 when it happened......... I was playin basketball with my brother that went on for an hour, i told him i would take my last shot when i looked up over the seperate garage where the basket was when i saw a complete flat object with lights surrounding it , the colors were in a pattern... blue,white,yellow,green.  iI told my brother to go inside and get the camera,as Im looked at it with Schooly's Mountain in the background, but he came back saying he coudnt find it so i told him to watch it while i got it.  When i came back my bro was with my mom with the craft no where in sight. I got so mad I beat my brother up for getting my mom instead of watching it.  Later in life sometimes it is like the craft is still there watching me... i just cant get over it. P.S. mom has my no recollection and my brother has very little yrt rembers it too!
