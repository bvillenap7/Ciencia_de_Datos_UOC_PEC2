UFO sighting on 7/12/01;2001-07-12 05:15:00;5 seconds;UFO sighting on 7/12/01 I was traveling eastbound on Rt. 24 in Morristown. It was 0515 hrs. The sky was perfectly clear. It was a mix of dark semi light and light. Traveling north bound at approximately 30-35 degrees from the earth was a bright light traveling extremely fast. Additionally., it was perferfectly horizontal to the earth. Behind the light was a trail (vapor?). The object was a size I have never seen before. It would appear to have been over either the Garden State Parkway or the New Jersey Turnpike. These highway systems at thes point are about 5-8 miles apart. At a point the object and the vapor simply disappeared. It was as though someone simply turned off a light switch and a room went dark. I report this now given the news story of sightings of unidentified objects this past Sunday night in New Jersey. Had I not seen this story on the national news this morning, I would hasve dismissed this entirely. I have never witnessed a phenemonon such as this in my life.

Bright fast quick light streak.;2013-10-24 07:30:00;3 seconds;bright fast quick light streak A super fast ultra bright light streak appeared in the sky for only a few seconds. Faster than any plane, brighter than any light I've ever seen.  Like a shooting star but faster & brighter then disappeared, not like how a shooting fades.  Bright like an LED ultra-bright white color.;40.7939511811024;-74.4874787401575
