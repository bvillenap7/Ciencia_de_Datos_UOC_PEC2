A triangular object with a light on each corner flies across the highway in a straight line while spinning around.;2009-01-24 22:30:00;About 20 seconds;A triangular object with a light on each corner flies across the highway in a straight line while spinning around. I was in a car going home after hockey practice from Morristown, New Jersey. It was about 10:30 pm, and my mom was driving the car, my sister was in the back asleep. We were on the highway, and there were plenty of airplanes flying around. The sky was cloudy so instead of it being a dark blue/black color, it was sort of light purple and I could easily see the shapes of all of the airplanes against the night sky. hen I saw something flying that didn’t look like an airplane at all. It was triangular shaped and had an off-white light on each corner. It was flying very close to the ground and didn’t produce any noise. We drove almost directly under it. What struck me as most interesting was that it was flying in a straight line, at a constant medium speed, but was spinning around at the same time. At first all I saw were three lights spinning around, but as it got closer I saw that it was a triangle. It wasn’t large at all, and it looked to be about the size of a small commercial airplane, or even a jet. One of the lights on it was blinking as well. It was flying across the highway when I saw it, and I stared at it until it disappeared behind the trees on the sides of the highway. However, it didn’t look like it landed. I only saw one. I saw many other airplanes after that, including commercial airplanes, jets, and small individually owned ones, but none of them had the same shape, light color, or light blinking pattern as the triangular flying object did. I have always been interested in UFO's and have believed in aliens for quite a while, and this definitely looked like something that I've seen on UFO shows. In the past I thought that I'd seen UFO's before, but it took me only a few seconds to realize that it was an airplane. This aircraft however showed no signs of being one.;40.7939511811024;-74.4874787401575
Boomerang shaped craft in New Jersey.;2014-08-17 01:00:00;2 minutes;Boomerang shaped craft in New Jersey. A few nights ago at around 1:00 am I was sitting on my porch, smoking a cigarette, before I went up to bed I noticed a circular craft flying over head very fast it had multiple light but was flying very high in the sky so I couldn't get a great look at it behind that craft was 2 fighter jet looking aircraft flying side by side as my attention was focused on the sky I turned my head to the right and spotted a very low flying boomerang shaped air craft it had 6 red lights and a few blue lights under the craft what was strange to me was how clear these lights were they also had no reflection it's hard to explain but the lights were projecting differently then anything I have ever seen there was absolutely no aura or haze around the lights at all the craft was only about 200 feet away and it didn't make a sound in fact when the aircraft passed everything seemed to go silent;40.7939511811024;-74.4874787401575
Dark Triangle Spotted in Cloud Cover on I-287 Near Morristown NJ;2018-01-11 07:30:00;4 seconds;Dark Triangle Spotted in Cloud Cover on I-287 Near Morristown, NJ The event occurred traveling northbound on interstate 287 between Basking Ridge and Morristown.  Visibility was good at street level but the sky was opaque with low lying cloud cover.   At approximate 7:30am EST, a dark triangle moved through my field of vision on a westerly trajectory, through the clouds, disturbing the cloud around it as it traveled like a hand through smoke. I could not get a definitive view as it was using the cloud cover.  All that was visible was its triangular shape and that it was black or very dark grey.  It was silent, had no lights and was moving at a fast rate of speed.  Viewing lasted for about 4 seconds.  My best estimate is that the object was about a half a mile downrange and maybe 200-300 feet above the ground,  Just high enough to use the cloud cover.  Considering the distance and size of the object in my field of view my best guess is that it was about 100' from edge to edge.  Morristown does have a small airport, but whatever this was, it just didn't look like a plane or anything you would normally see.;40.7939511811024;-74.4874787401575
