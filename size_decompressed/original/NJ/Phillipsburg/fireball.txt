50 red fireballs flying over NJ.;2010-07-03 19:00:00;1 hour;50 red fireballs flying over NJ. On July 3rd, 2010, I was at a friend's picnic.  It was getting dark out, when I noticed 3 balls of light floating in the sky.  They were moving at a good pace.  I pointed them out to my friends as we watched one after another float by.  They were in clusters.  After the first three went by, then there were a bunch at a time going by. I would say we saw about 50 of them.  We have NO idea what they were.;40.7079;-75.1507000000001
