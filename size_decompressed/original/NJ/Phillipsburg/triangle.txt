Flying object with 3 lights. One at each end . Triangular shape;2004-02-17 19:00:00;3 minutes;Flying object with 3 lights. One at each end . Triangular shape While taking out the garbage, My girfriend spoted what seem like a plane in the sky going in circles. The Object had 3 lights one at each end. we thought it was a plane, but then it began doing arial acrobatics. Loops, suddendly drops comming very close to the ground. This is a very redidential area and the nearest airport is 15-20 miles away. It was comming so low to the ground, we were scared for our lives. After several loops and drops and circles at very high speeds. Again on a residential Area. At one point it seemed that it was comming toward us, then suddenly made a sharp left (my right) and took off so fast. I ran to see the direcction in which went but it was too fast to keep up at night. This object came within 50 to 100 feet of the ground when performing the straight down drops. I keep thinking about the sound that emmited, but I can't make it out. Nothing i heard before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));40.7079;-75.1507000000001

We both notice a bright light hovering over the cemetery.  We drove down the road closest to the cemetery because the roads leading in are gated off at dusk.  Anyway, we get pretty close to the lights and it's still hovering above the cemetery.  All of a sudden, the altitude increases and slowly starts to fly toward us.  We open the sunroof and turn the volume down in the car.  The aircraft is making a loud, vibrating noise and has three red lights underneath it, when it flew over us.   Within a minute or so, it picked up speed, and we followed it down the road, going at least 40 mph, and it went over a treeline and just disappeared.   We both saw the same exact thing.  It was a black, triangle aircraft with three red lights underneath, and bright beams all around the sides of it.   We saw this aircraft for 3 minutes before it vanished over the treelines.;40.7079;-75.1507000000001
