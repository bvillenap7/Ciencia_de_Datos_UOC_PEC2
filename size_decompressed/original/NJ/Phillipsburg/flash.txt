Bright lighted craft over Phillipsburg, NJ and Easton, PA;2008-08-19 21:07:00;20 minutes;Bright lighted craft over Phillipsburg, NJ and Easton, PA Last night I observed what appeared to crafts with white and red strobe lights and many other lesser lights.  They had more than an airplane would have.  It looked like two flying side by side.  They came from out of the west (from near Easton, PA) headed east towards Phillipsburg, NJ.  They flew 5 miles or so easterly and then turned over Alpha, NJ.  They flew along route 78 and then made a right turn headed west.  It looked like they were following route 78 between PA and NJ.  They flew over Williams Township, PA.  After talking to my son (who lives in Easton, PA), he also saw them flying, they had lights and looked to be two crafts together.  As he watched, they appeared to make a right turn to head east again.  All through observing the lights, I heard no noises at all.  There were no engine or propulsion noises whatsoever.  Because I was in the Air Force, I am familiar with the noises of aircraft engines. The lights seemed to make a big loop at least four times.  After the fourth time, when they came east over NJ, they turned south and then seemed to leave  I watched for a bit but they didnâ€™t come back.  I would like to note that all through my observations, the crafts flew slowly, much more slowly than would an airplane or jet or other aircraft.  They were about as high as a pipercub or helicopter would fly, however, the craft were neither of these.  It almost seemed as though they were looking for something along route 78 or following 78.;40.7079;-75.1507000000001
