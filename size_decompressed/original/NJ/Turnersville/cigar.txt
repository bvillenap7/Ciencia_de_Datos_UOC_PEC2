I have been seeing these craft in the woods next to my home for several weeks. It started 1-28-08. They fly over my home above the tree line. Then they seem to turn sideways and hover then go down in the trees. My daughter and I have also experiences strange occurrences around our home. A dead bird on our porch that looked like it and a branch fell of a tree , but in was under our awning. Also a bright flash of light in our kitchen, it came in thru a crack in the curtains. Dimming of the lights in our home at night. I also caught on tape lights on the side of our neighbors house. One red light in the trees, a purple/blue light on the ground next to their house and other phenomena. It has increased in intensity over the weeks. Started with me seeing blinking lights in the sky.;39.7897;-75.0355
