I was looking out of my window which faces the east when i saw a big ball of white light.  It appeared to be moing slowly from the left to the right of my view.  Then it stopped and began to slowly ascend upward in the sky.  At the top of it's ascent the ball of white light transformed into a triangular shape of alternating, blinking red and blue lights.   Then it changed to a ball of red light, smaller than when it was a ball of white light, and at a very fast speed sped off back in the direction it came from.;40.4636;-74.2784
