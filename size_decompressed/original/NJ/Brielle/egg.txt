I have never reported anything in my life in over 50 years.   is is the second time this week I have seen an egg shaped object in the south western sky.   took my binoculars out and it moves in an strange way going in one circular direction an then in an other.  t seems to have either craters or openings on the object.   What other reports have come out about this objec? ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the data above.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
