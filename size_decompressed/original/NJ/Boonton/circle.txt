Unexplained lights over New Jersey.;2021-08-23 22:00:00;10 minutes;Unexplained lights over New Jersey. Started as 3 lights. 2 above each other and one to the right like a triangle. The lights then spaced apart and 2 more come in. Lights were hovering and very bright. Brighter than a star or planet. There was no sound. The lights moved apart almost in sequence before one by one leaving. I have it all on video.;40.9124;-74.4113
