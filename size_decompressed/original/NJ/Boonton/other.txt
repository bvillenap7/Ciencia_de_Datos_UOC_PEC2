Three flare-like objects slowly moving vertically at a great distance;2005-09-21 19:00:00;20 minutes;Three flare-like objects slowly moving vertically at a great distance This ocurred near dusk, in the northwest horizon. The sky was clear. We observed an orange flare in the horizon above a mountain ridge to the northwest. It was very far in the distance, the orange hue presumably due to the sun reflection. We took a closer look with binoculars and a telescope. The best way to describe it was that it looked like a candle flame - one that you would see in a drawing or cartoon. It had the same teardrop shape and through the telescope you could see that there was a central ridge of blank dividing the two orange flares. This object moved slowly vertically into the sky, and disappeared. It was immediately followed by a second object of the same description, which appeared over the mountain ridge and then slowly ascended and disappeared. About 5 minutes later, a third object repeated this same pattern. The entire incident took about 15-20 minutes. The objects were very far in the distance. The objects moved almost directly perpendicular to the horizon, indicating that they were ascending. My best guess is that they disappeared when they reached the end point of the setting sun where the sun was no longer reflecting.;40.9124;-74.4113
