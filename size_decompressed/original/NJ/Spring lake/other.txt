Object in sky no sound, red lights. Slow moving.;2010-07-22 17:00:00;10 minutes;Object in sky no sound, red lights. Slow moving. Here's the situation, my dates may be a little off but I'm close. I have had weird things happen to me all my life, I live in Monmouth county NJ and am surrounded by Earl naval weapons station, as well as the now closed camp Evans. I received a phone call from my mom, approx 5:30-6:00 pm est. ( my mother does not believe in UFOs). My wife answered my cell phone and said  your moms on the phone, and she says you can see a space station flying though the sky? Traveling north to south, and it is very low in the sky. I went outside my house on ST. route 71 and looked up at the sky, looking west. I call to my wife   I think my mom is crazy, I don't see anything.  Then all of the sudden. This is what I saw. Traveling north to south, I look up and there is this object in the sky, I can not give you a shape, as I don't recall a shape, what I saw was almost like a craft to say the least.  There were three red lights in a line evenly spaced apart.  The object was about 300ft or so high up in the air, but it made not a single noise.  The object moved slow, I screamed for my wife to come out and check this out. My wife came outside and saw what I saw we stared for a couple seconds.  I told my wife to grab my truck keys, she ran in the house and we hoped out and started to follow the object.  As we drove down 71 following the object south, it suddenly sped up and shot east over the Atlantic Ocean.  We followed it to Manasquan Inlet and could not go any further, the object disappeared. I have many weird situations that happen and I think it has to do with camp Evans. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));40.1511;-74.0345
