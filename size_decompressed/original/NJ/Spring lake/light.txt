Two orange lights seen flying over the Atlantic Ocean and vanishing in seconds;2015-06-20 00:15:00;20 seconds;Two orange lights seen flying over the Atlantic Ocean and vanishing in seconds My two sisters and I were sitting outside looking out over the ocean on a clear night just after midnight when we saw two lights flying across the sky.  They were flying fairly low for an airplane, and they seemed to keep a perfect, unwavering distance apart.  The lights were also more orange than airplanes or other aircrafts, almost like flying orange orbs, but it was a bit too dark and too distant to observe their exact shape.  They saw them for about 15-20 seconds, and we actually talked about what were seeing, then, all at once, they seemed to turn away and disappear entirely.  This was even more odd because it was a relatively clear night, so it's not like they were hidden behind a dark cloud, but we didn't see anything else in the air for the next 15 minutes or so.;40.1511;-74.0345
