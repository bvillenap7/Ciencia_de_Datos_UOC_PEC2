I looked up and, as in my past sightings, saw a round flying/gliding (such smooth fluid movement) objects that looked small enough to be a star but again it was moving, it was too high to be a plane and it didn't have blinking lights like all the other planes clearly overhead, again it was up sooo high way past where planes fly.  It didn't fly straight enough and I have to assume it was traveling too fast to be a satellite (how high it was and how quick it went across sky was way too quick considering every inch it traveled was probably a ridiculous amount of miles.  Made planes look like slow pokes) I followed until it disappeared, which means it zipped off or went too high in altitude, as the sky was very clear no clouds.  That one disappeared and a minute or two later I saw another in a different area of the sky, same as the other, traveling around way too high to be a plane, glowing as bright as a star.   All together it was 10-15 minutes of observation;40.9453602739726;-74.2519219178081

The ball of light looked like it was smaller than the airplanes, but still big and round. No wings were visible.;40.9453602739726;-74.2519219178081
