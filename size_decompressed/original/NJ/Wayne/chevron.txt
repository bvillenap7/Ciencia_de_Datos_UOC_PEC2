no lights or sound, flat, black, v-shape suspended in the sky, slowly rotated.;2001-06-02 18:00:00;8 minutes;No lights or sound,flat, black, v shape, suspended in the sky, slowly rotated. My daughter & myself were driving & my daughter noticed it first & put my attention to this thing.  It was black, no lights or noise, like a v shape & it was kind of flat on the top & bottom.  It was probably less than 1000 ft high up.  It just was suspended there & slowly rotated one time & then stopped.   We just watched it.  My daughter looked at the time in the car & I guess we watched it for approx. 8 min.  When it started to rise, it kind of turned one side towards the sky & ascended rather fast.  I think it looked like a rod shape cause of the position as it rose.   I watched it until it disappeared into the clouds.  It looked like a pencil line in the clouds.   It was about 6pm, still daylight.  It had no cockpit or front end like a plane has.  I can't believe the good view we had of it.  It manuevered itself so easily as if had no trouble with gravity.  It's hard to explain.  Did anyone else see this?  Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other report from this date from Long Island, NY.  PD));40.9453602739726;-74.2519219178081
