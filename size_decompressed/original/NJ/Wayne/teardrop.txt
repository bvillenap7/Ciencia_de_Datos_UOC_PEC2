I looked out the window and noticed a flying object no more than 500 ft in the air. At first I thought it was a airplane, but then then it picked up speed, and moved one mile in less then 3 seconds. Then it dissapered. The second sighting, it was the same object, over the same area, flying the exact same route, except this one just dissapered into the after 3 seconds........the lights on the craft were weird, they were yellow, green, blue, and black. Funny thing, is it made no sound.....if you would like to contact me, please do so through email.;40.9453602739726;-74.2519219178081
