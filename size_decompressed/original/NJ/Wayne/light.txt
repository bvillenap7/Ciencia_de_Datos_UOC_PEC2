Dull orange light over Wayne NJ;2012-09-29 22:00:00;2 minutes;Dull orange light over Wayne NJ I was I the car with my girlfriend and I noticed an odd looking orange light in the sky.  I jokingly said to her, Check it out, it's a UFO, but the longer I looked it just didn't seem like a plane.  It wasn't blinking, moving very slow, and she said, I think you're right, because that's no plane.   We were stuck at a red light and all of a sudden it disappeared right before our eyes.  It was the oddest thing, and the overpowering sense of fear that I felt.  I can't prove it was a UFO because as I mentioned we were in the car and I could not justify the direction of the wind or anything.  Maybe it was one of those Chinese lanterns, but I figured sending a report wouldn't hurt, maybe somebody else saw it.;40.9453602739726;-74.2519219178081
