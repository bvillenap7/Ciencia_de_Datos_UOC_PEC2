extremly fast unknown plane possibily DoD spraying chemtrails Wayne, NJ.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect they were contrails.  PD));2009-06-08 12:00:00;1 hour;Extremly fast unknown plane possibily DoD spraying chemtrails Wayne, NJ I saw two planes which were small flying in a pair over Kinnelon, NJ.  They crossed the sky in seconds. Faster than anything I've ever seen.  Then about 10 minutes later they zoomed across the horizon again (Wayne, NJ).  They were spraying something-whitish.  Later my car was covered with residue and this whitish dust flaked off like aluminum oxide. The planes were silver, small with no markings-not the type that would be used for commercial flight-probably military on a chemtrails operations is my best guess.  Why would spray a residential area?  There have been many strange contrails criss-crossing the sky in 2009-2010.  Coming from Lakewood Air Force Base?  Not alien planet.

Saw multiple aircraft, a bright white light and smaller red lights.;2019-08-01 23:00:00;20 minutes;Saw multiple aircrafts, a bright white light and smaller red lights. Started out by just seeing a bright yellow/white light in the sky just sitting still for a while - definitely wasn't a star.  Kept looking at it for around 5 min and some dimmer red lights (like speckles) brighten up all around the bright light.  My eyes were locked on to it and I see air crafts fly above the trees.  Their shape were four donuts arranged with one on the top/bottom and one each on the side  Think like the body arrangement of a butterfly with one donut for its head, tail and wings.  They zoomed by incredibly quickly and that was the last I saw of them.  The bright light slowly moved out of view over the course of 25 min.;40.9453602739726;-74.2519219178081
