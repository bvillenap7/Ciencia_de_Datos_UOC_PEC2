bright white lights with rapid speeds;2006-03-28 23:00:00;5 minutes;bright white lights with rapid speeds I was traveling on ratzer road when I noticed a bright white light in the sky having no direction and at times just hoovering and then flying off quickly . I was heading in the direction it went and I found it again still having no direction and flying at rapid speeds. Then I noticed a triangular silver craft with 3 bright white lights and at times had blinking red lights and no sound slowly head south towards the other craft I was following. It was flying very low and slow. Definetly not an airplane!!;40.9453602739726;-74.2519219178081
3 Lights rotating fixed to each other that split up and flew off fast.;2013-12-26 20:00:00;20 seconds;3 Lights rotating fixed to each other that split up and flew off fast. I was going with my girlfriend to ((name of store deleted)) in Wayne on Rt 23, when I looked up as 3 lights caught my eye.   There were 3 lights (white) fixed in orbit as they slowly, slowly rotated I think anti-clockwise.  I shouted LOOK! as the lights were so unusual with such a flight path and at such slow speed.   Then I thought it could be a hoax, but then as the yrotated in fixed orbit with each other, the top most light ball, very rapidly went upwards and away from the other 2 lights, then the lower 2 lights leveled out to a flat plane, then as it became level with the horizon, a single red light began to blink between the 2 white lights that were left behind. At this point I simply thought, Oh, it's a plane.  But in the morning realized that did not explain the fixed orbit rotation of all 3 lights initially, then the single orb that flew up and away rapidly.  While my common sense tried to kick in and tell me this was only an aircraft, the more it did not make ! sense.  I am totally bummed I had not seen in a few seconds sooner and wish I had stopped the car to see the whole sequence of events, as we were looking to park the car.  What is funny is that I saw enough for myself to convince me it was something different, but as soon as I shouted LOOK! and my gf looked, it began acting more like an aircraft except for the 1 light I could not explain.  Totally confused and amazed all at once.  An awesome start to 2014   :) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.9453602739726;-74.2519219178081
