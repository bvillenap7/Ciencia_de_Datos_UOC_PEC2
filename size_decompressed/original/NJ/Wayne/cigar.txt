I was walking down the street and there was a loud bang and then a cigar shaped object flew over me. It then circled back and went eastward. This lasted for approximately 30 seconds. Then suddenly it flew away. It was grayish in color and i would say about 30-40 feet long.;40.9453602739726;-74.2519219178081
Bright, Cigar Shaped UFO following Commercial Jetliner in NJ;2007-06-19 15:00:00;25 seconds;Bright, Cigar Shaped UFO following Commercial Jetliner in NJ I live underneath a congested air traffic area that it used for approaches to Newark Liberty, Laguadia, and JFK. The bright, white, cigar shaped object that my grandmother and I spotted was following an approaching commercial jetliner. The UFO was located slightly above the jetliner, following from a distance of about 5-10 miles behind it. The UFO didn't make any sharp movements, nor did it grossly stand out. The UFO simply followed the jetliner at a constant safe speed in a direct straight line.;40.9453602739726;-74.2519219178081
