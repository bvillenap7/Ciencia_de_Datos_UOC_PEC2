4 Witnesses See Hovering Fireball in Woodstown, NJ;2012-08-25 23:00:00;20 seconds;4 Witnesses See Hovering Fireball in Woodstown, NJ At the Salem County Fairgrounds in New Jersey around 11pm on August 25, 2012 - four witnesses including myself saw a UFO.  We were attending the Mint Green Music Festival (an Electronic/Psychedelic music festival) which was held on the grounds.  The four of us were back at the campsite at the edge of the grounds (next to a forested area) while most of our companions and most of the festival goers were at the stage. One of my three friends noticed a fire-y orange burning light glowing in the sky behind the tree line, and pointed it out.  I suggested it was one of those &quotChinese lanterns&quot that you see people set off at weddings and such.  However, the small fireball slowly moved from behind the tree line into plain view, and then stopped moving in mid-air and started alternatively shrinking and expanding in a slow steady rhythm.  It seemed to me to be hovering in place about 80 feet in the air, maybe 500 feet away from us.  This shrinking/expanding pulsing happened for about 15 seconds as the four of us described what we were seeing to each other. At this point, I suggested we watch it in silence.  A moment later, the fireball shrunk, and then disappeared rapidly.  It seemed to have zoomed off at an incredible speed through the sky away from us and the festival.  It happened so fast that it was hard to tell.  As the UFO zoomed away, a white beam of light that resembled a shooting star came across the sky in the same area at a different angle. At least two of us saw the beam of light.  Most of us agreed that the fireball UFO was a pulsing sphere, however one of us said she saw a floating fire-y box.  We are unsure if the white beam of light was a shooting star or not, it was cloudy most of the night so we were surprised to see it.;39.6444;-75.3222
