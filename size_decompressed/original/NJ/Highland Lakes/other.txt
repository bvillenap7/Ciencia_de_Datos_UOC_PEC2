Unidentified satellite.;2019-07-03 21:00:00;90 seconds;Unidentified satellite. At 9:44EST I saw it fly from NNW to SE approximately 1.5 minutes fly over time. I see TONS and TONS of airplanes fly over my home. It was not an airplane. There were no flashing lights. It was moving fast but not fast like a meteor. It had that consistent shine of a satellite passing by. At first, I thought it was the ISS but when I searched for sighting info of ISS for my area the times did not match up. I just want to know what it was. Thanks!;41.182;-74.4552
