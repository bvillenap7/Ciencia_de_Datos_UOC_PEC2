Bright light moving slowly and erratically.  ((anonymous report));2019-09-17 16:15:00;2-3 minutes;Bright light moving slowly and erratically I was in my pool watching the flight paths of planes departing and approaching NIA and Teterboro Airport. I observed a bright light moving in a North to South direction flying very slowly in an erratic pattern ( zig zagging ).  The object did not emit any sound.  It was moving in an area not normally used by landing and taking off aircraft.  At first I thought it may have been an errant helium balloon.  After about 2 to 3 minutes it just vanished. I previously observed this phenomena in early July, same type of sighting around the same time of in the afternoon.  That one however was observed due East and was repeatedly moving vertical to horizontal for about 5 minutes and likewise disappeared.  The best way to describe what the lights looked like was a bright star or planet.;40.8185;-74.1588999999999
