All my life I 've looked up at the sky, hoping to catch something .. rare. I respect the UFO phenomenon that of which I would never report things I didn't think was, Good Capture. I saw a red craft, very far, around the Hudson river, between Lower Manhatten and Hoboken area.  It was no plane, I have never red lights of the sort, it vanished fairly quick.  Planes pass by every 5 minutes, same flight path, but this one,.. stood out from afar the common flight path.   It kept flickering prob 3 flickers per second.  It seemed small and headed towards Manhattan, which is weird because usually planes fly around the city, not towards it.;40.7695947368421;-74.0290789473685
