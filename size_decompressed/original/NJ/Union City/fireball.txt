A bright light falls from the sky over New Jersey.;2006-11-21 01:00:00;10 seconds;A bright light falls from the sky over New Jersey. At 1:02 am on November 21, 2006 I saw something fall from the sky.  I was smoking on my fireescape outside my window when something caught my attention.  A bright ball of light fell through a dense group of clouds.   It was bright white and had a smokey tail.  There was a bright green coloring throughout the tail.  The ball was a little smaller than a quarter and bigger than a nickel when held at arm's length. That's the best way I can describe the size of it.  I have never seen anything quite like it.  I was in the military from 2001 to 2004 and have seen all sorts of aircrafts. This object looked like a flare shooting down from the clouds.  Except it didn't fall straight down, it fell at an angle.   It burned very bright for about 5 or 6 seconds before it disappeared.  I've seen flares dropped from an aircraft before and this definitely wasn't one of them.  I've seen lots of shooting stars overseas and this definitely wasn't a shooting star.   When I saw this object I was very startled. I actually ducked. I thought a plane had been shot down for a moment.   But then I noticed that it wasn't falling straight down but moving at a downward angle at a high rate of speed.  I've never seen anything quite like it and I have no logical explanation for it.;40.7695947368421;-74.0290789473685
