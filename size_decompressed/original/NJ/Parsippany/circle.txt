My 16 year old son and I saw 9 red circular unidentified flying objects.  First they were scattered then they gathered in a straight line. We pulled over with two three other vehicles who all watched together in awe as these objects changed formations. I called the Parsippany police and they said they knew about it but didn't know what they were but were investigating it. One UFO slowly dropped from the sky and disappeared and the rest slowly disappeared over another 10 minute span. With so many eyewitnesses seeing the same thing we could not believe our eyes and I never saw anything like this.;40.8617000000002;-74.4104000000002
