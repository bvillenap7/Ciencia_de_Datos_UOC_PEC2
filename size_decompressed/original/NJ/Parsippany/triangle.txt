Flying triangle spotted in new jersey;2004-03-15 20:45:00;1:30;Flying triangle spotted in new jersey A couple of years ago after I have left my job in the evening I was traveling route 287 north bound when I spotted a light that had a triangle shape.  It's lights were not blinking, rather it was solid white in nature, yet flying above the tree line at night. I was sure it was not a plane. I guess it was following my car for roughly one mile before it disappeared into the mountains near a large rock quarry.  I rolled down my windows to make sure it was not a glare reflecting my windows, but it became even more clearer and brighter even after that.  I called my wife on the cell phone, and she thought I was playing a game with her.  To this day I can vividly see the object.  It made no noise like a plane either.;40.8617000000002;-74.4104000000002

I was walking in my complex when I started to look up at the stars since they were so visible.  That's when I noticed an object moving across the sky very fast with NO SOUND.   It appeared to be almost invisible with a outline of a boomerang.  On the bottom there were two dim orange lights almost like a flashlight when the battery dies.   And has it went by it just faded away while still moving very fast!;40.8617000000002;-74.4104000000002
