Round Green light flew over my house in Parsippany;2004-02-14 21:30:00;Less than 1 second;Round Green light flew over my house in Parsippany I have a couple of skylights in my living room.  I was watching TV as I usually do on Saturday night and just happened to look up.  Through the skylight I saw a bright green light the size of a basketball zip though the sky.  It was going pretty straight and appeared to jump upward at the end of the window.  This jump may have been an illusion because the skylights are a dome shaped window. I got up to look and it was gone.  The background Information  I was in my house, the ceiling fan light was on.  The Sky was black, it was a clear night, I could not see any stars in the window.  Also, Parsippany is in the landing/takeoff patern of Newark Liberty Airport.  I see Planes in that same window all the time, but the planes I see have 3 lights and fly much higher.  This wasvery low in the night sky.  It was probably nothing, but I wanted to report it anyway. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));40.8617000000002;-74.4104000000002
Thre red lights observed over Morris Plains and Parsippany New Jersey in Morris County, USA;2009-02-07 20:08:00;5-7 minutes;Three red lights observed over Morris Plains and Parsippany New Jersey in Morris County, USA Three bright red light traveling towards North in a straight line were seen across my living room window. They looked just like the red lights seen in news on January 5th 2009 in the same area. I grabbed my camcorder but the lights passed behind trees. The lights were traveling very fast. I ran downstairs to capture on video but they changed direction eastwards in the direction of New York City. They stayed close together in a triangle shape and gained altitude fast. Some clouds were above them and they disappeared into the clouds. Overhead it was still clear with moon and stars. The lights did not flicker or move around, they were steady lights. There was no smoke or any trail.;40.8617000000002;-74.4104000000002
