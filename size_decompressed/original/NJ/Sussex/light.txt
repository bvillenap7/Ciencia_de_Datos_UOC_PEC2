5 UFOs and 2 sats? crossing same area of sky;2009-05-24 23:00:00;7 min;5 UFOs and 2 sats? crossing same area of sky Needed binoculars.  I have 2 canon stabilized 10x30s  Nomally watch for sats, this time I got what looked like 5 mid level bright stars at once, in a pin ball machine.  Area of sky involved was covered by my hand at arms length.  They would start and stop, no curves in flight pattern. 2 mirrored each other a few times.  One low one high. What was even stranger is that 2 sats came 10seconds apart one from SW then one from NE crossing the same part of the sky.  UFOs left and returned 3 times then left after first sat came.  The sats were larger and dimmer. View was to the north 40 deg up from level.  Lightning was seen to the south. I will try to film next time.;41.2301;-74.5963
Green Light moves across sky at high Speeds;2020-12-14 23:56:00;A Few Seconds;Green Light moves across sky at high Speeds I was going down Route 23. When in my Upper Windshield, I saw a Green Light go very fast across the sky, too fast to be a plane. I told my friends on Discord after pulling over. The next day I drove the same route and saw many police and Hazmat crews in the area. I don't know if it was related.;41.2301;-74.5963
