Shiny orange objects seen in Sunset colored sky in New Jersey on May 6;2001-05-06 19:30:00;30 mins, atleast when i s;Shiny orange objects seen in Sunset colored sky in New Jersey on May 6 When we 1st saw, it was toward the northe west corner of the sky just over the sunset. It was a sunset colored and cloudless sky. We came over the mountain/hill thing on Rt.23 where u get a good veiw.  We saw these shiny orange things in the sky.  1 was to the right of the sun, it was siny orange color,like a weird shape, another just like it to the right with another by it which was either a disk or a meteor with a trail.  Some either seemed to move away in the sky or dip below the horizon and some just simply vanished.  But a few others would just pop out of no where, it was really cool but weird. Toward the end of the event me and my mom saw one that just appeared and it definitley was moving fast than the others, it definitley had a tail, i think it was a meteor,  by the time it was completley dark all of them were gone.  there were no more than 5 in the sky at one time. There must have been other witnesses cause planes from the airport took off,  about 3 planes so we werent the only ones that saw im guessing.  And the airport wasnt military if that helps.;41.2301;-74.5963
