The light dimmed to the point where I could barely see it then suddenly reappeared. I was walking my friends dogs in the park that night. Hale Bopp was behind me to the right, low in the sky. I looked up at the stars and a bright white light appeared high in the sky. It slowly began moving to the left and at the same time dimmed to a faint yellow. The light became so dim that I could barely make it out. It came to a stop then it suddenly reappeared as a sharp point of white light. The light began rotating around in a circle a yellow light then appeared opposite of the white. As  both lights were spinning clockwise a blue light turned on giving the impression of a multicolored ring. the glowing ring then quickly rose up towards the stars and dissappeared. My friend asked me if I had seen that and I couldn't reply. I didn't want to blink. The lights made no sound so the noise of an approaching jet blinking in the distance startled me.;40.8785;-73.9448
