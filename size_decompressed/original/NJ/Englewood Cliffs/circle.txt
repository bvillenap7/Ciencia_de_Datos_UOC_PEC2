LOOKING NORTHWEST AT APROX. 45-55 DEGREES FROM HORIZON. TRAVELED TO NORTHEAST AT METEOR SPEED UPWARD.;1999-11-16 19:05:00;5-10 SEC.;LOOKING NORTHWEST AT APROX. 45-55 DEGREES FROM HORIZON. TRAVELED TO NORTHEAST AT METEOR SPEED UPWARD. THEY WERE STAR LIKE BRIGHTNESS IN 3 PAIRS. THE FIRST WERE A LITTLE BRIGHTER OR CLOSER, AND LEFT A TRAIL OR PLUME IN A SOMEWHAT TRIANGLAR AND SHORT SHAPE. THE SECOND AND THIRD PAIR WERE IDENTICALLY SPACED APART AND FOLLOWED IN A PRECISE AND EXACT PATH BEHIND THE FIRST. THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO LEAVE A TRAIL, OR I COULDN'T SEE ANY. ALL 3 PAIRS WERE GONE BY 80 DEGREES ANGLE ON THE HORIZON. THE PRESCISE ALIGNMENT OF THE SECOND AND THIRD IS WHAT AMAZED ME BEHIND THE LEADER. IVE SEEN LOTS OF METEORS SINCE I WAS A KID, BUT THESE WERE DIFFERENT. THEY LEFT THE ATMOSHERE INSTEAD OF FALLING, AND THE PRECISE ALIGNMENT AND DIFFERENT TRAIL PATTERN. ALL 6 LIGHTS WERE IN STRAIGHT ALIGNMENT. THERE WERE GONE IN 5- 10 SECONDS. THIS WAS THE NIGHT OF THE METEOR SIGHTINGS,BUT THEY WERE DIFFERENT AND WERE NOT IN THE CORRECT SECTION IN THE SKY FOR VIEWING. I WAS JUST LETTING TO DOG OUT IN THE BACK YARD AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING.;40.8785;-73.9448
