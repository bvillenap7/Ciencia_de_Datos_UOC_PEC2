It was perhaps mid April with very puffy white spring clouds set against a clear blue sky. While looking up at the sky I noticed an object silently passing through the clouds. (The clouds were at an altitude of approx. 1000 feet) The underside of the craft matched the color of the blue sky perfectly, but against the backdrop of the low white cloud it was perfectly visable. When it pass through the cloud into the clear sky, the shape of the pentagon shaped craft was barely visable. It was a large craft as it took up half of the cloud as it passed through.
