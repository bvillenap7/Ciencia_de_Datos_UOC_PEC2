At this point, there were four objects, and they were increasing in brightness and they seemed to be merging, forming one, and then they would separate.  This was about 5 minutes into the occurance when a customer in the car next to me was exiting his vehicle and I asked him to look to see if he was seeing the same thing I was seeing.  When I pointed to the direction of the objects, the gentlemen exclaimed, yes, I definately see that...but I don't know what to make of it.  He continued for a few minutes to watch with me, but then proceeded in to do his shopping.  Approximately 15 minutes had passed by at this point as I'm still observing, when my wife comes out with my kids to return to the car.  I pointed it out to them, but the event was fading away, because at this point the horizon was succombing to dusk.;39.8587;-75.0436
