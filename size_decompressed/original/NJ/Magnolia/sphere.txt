Bright Sphere;2011-05-21 01:00:00;10 minutes;Bright Sphere Upon coming home I always like to look into the sky to see the stars. That night, I saw an object that was flashing intensely and moving in a zig zag sort of direction.  We are close to an airport the PHL of Philadelphia International.  So, as always, I was skeptical. I waited and watched the object and it was not flying like normal air traffic.  The flashing was not the normal colors but bright and various red and oranges and a white.  It was stationary for a few minutes like hovering in mid air. The object zigged & zagged several times then flew straight up then down and a final 90 degree before shooting straight up into the night sky and vanished. I do not own a digital camera that would be of quality for pictures to be submitted at this time.;39.8587;-75.0436
