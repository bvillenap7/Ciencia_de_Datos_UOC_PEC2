1985 ufo over Magnolia Public School;1985-07-01 22:00:00;20 minutes;1985 ufo over Magnolia Public School Appox 10 pm I was sitting watching tv with my parents.when the tv got fuzzy. we heard some people making noise outside a few minutes later. when my dad looked outside to see what was going on he called us all outside. directly across the street from my house is a school yard , aprox. 100 yards away. hovering aprox 200 feet above the school was a huge bright white completely illuminated egglike sphere with a band of changing colored lights along the perimiter of this craft. we are located about 20 miles from phila. inter.airport. we were out side along with all of our neighbors looking up at this object it was about the size of a football feild. when airport traffic paterns came in our direction the object would black out almost invisible but because of our close distance we could still see it. we tried to call the local news stations but all outgoing calls ended busy even to other phones in our house as if it was jamming the phone lines and the cable was messy too.the object hovered silent for apox. 20 - 25 minutes the ramped up i guess is the best way to describe it , (it started speeding up the color changing lights as if it was building power) and it took off straight up in the air at a speed unimaginable, so fast it left a visual trail of light in the air almost like if you span a picture of a moving light it trails.everyone stayed out side for a while and taked about what it might be. we never saw it again.
