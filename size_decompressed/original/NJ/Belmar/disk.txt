On the beach observed a motionless spinning color changing light in the sky.  It cahnged from red to green to white and then seemed to spin colors of red and green.  Was motionless for 30 minutes.   Then seemed to go down and lights went out.   Might have been a kite with lights since it slowly lowered to ground but it would have had to be really big becaused it seemed to be a couple miles away.;40.1712;-74.0717
