Orange ball crossing over Belmar, NJ;2010-10-09 21:20:00;1 - 2 minutes;Orange ball crossing over Belmar, NJ My girlfriend and I were driving home from dinner.  My eyes are always in the sky, and I was pointing out how bright Jupiter was in the South sky through the windshield...but noticed it was *really* bright and orange.  Then I saw Jupiter in the background and realized this orange thing was moving.  At first we thought it was a meteor, but it was too slow.  We were both a bit shocked and pulled into a parking lot, got out and observed the light moving almost directly south for about two minutes.  About half-way between our zenith and the horizon, it briefly swelled in brightness and dwindled. The object was about five or six times the intensity of Jupiter...so it was very large in the night sky.  It was moving about the typical speed of a satellite, but I have seen dozens, perhaps hundreds, of satellites and the similarities end at speed.  I would estimate the altitude similar to a jet, based on observing a slight trajectory as the object moved away from us. We got in the car, made note of the time and came home to check the satellite trackers.  As far as we could find, there was nothing in our sky around 9:20.  I wouldn't be filling out this report if the object wasn't so blatant!;40.1712;-74.0717
Two orange lights spotted flying over ocean in NJ.;2014-04-27 21:00:00;30 minutes;Two orange lights spotted flying over ocean in NJ. A friend and I were walking in the beach around 9 pm when two orange lights caught my eye.  They were above the boat line and below the plane line.  They were moving back and forth in the sky in a horizontal pattern.  They were moving very quickly.   I watched it for about 30 min and then it disappeared.   I have this encounter on video.;40.1712;-74.0717
