For the past several months, we have noticed at Sunset, viewing at sea level on the New Jersey shore, looking west, there are objects that are crossing the Sun's path, 3 which I, and several others, believe are actually comets and possibly something else, which can only be seen when looking towards the sun at that skewed angle of declination. We have repeatedly seen these objects, which look similar to a short burst contrail from a plane, however, they stay the same length and move at the same skew line, each and every night, and have done so, for the past several months.  We took some photos and video and will be submitting it soon. If anyone has knowledge of what these objects are, that would be great. We are very curious at this point.;40.1712;-74.0717
