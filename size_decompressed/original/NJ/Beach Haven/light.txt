Occasionally,  there also seemed to be a reddish or orange glow surrounding it.  After a few minutes,  it took off to the north and out towards the sea and disappeared.  This same pattern repeated itself 10 minutes later.;39.6411;-74.1922

I run and get my family and we see the 3 lights that were close together spining around in a circle as they were moving closer to the ocean.  This went on for about 2 minutes then the lights disappeared down in to the ocean. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.6411;-74.1922

Wife and I were relaxing in a hot tub, watching the stars and looking for satellites.  We ended up seeing, what we initially believed to be, a rather bright satellite. It was so bright that we had thought we were viewing the ISS, but as it was traversing the sky it stopped abruptly.  After a second or two, it made quick, concise movements that were very different than its original trajectory.   After approximately 45 seconds the object traveled across the horizon, out of view.;39.6411;-74.1922
