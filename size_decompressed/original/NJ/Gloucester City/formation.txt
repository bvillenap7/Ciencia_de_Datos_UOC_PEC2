BRIGHT RED LIGHTS OVER PHILLY/SOUTH JERSEY AREA (FORMATION);2019-12-21 18:00:00;5 min;BRIGHT RED LIGHTS OVER PHILLY/SOUTH JERSEY AREA (FORMATION) I’m posting this because NOBODY on the internet, YouTube or even Snapchat stories in my area are NOT posting about what we saw and it’s driving my nuts. So I’m in the barbershop last night getting a cut. Halfway into it some barbers outside on their smoke break burst in the door yelling “Yo come out and look at the sky bro!!” So I’m in the chair with the smock on and I look in the sky and right over philly (philly is five miles from me just over the bridge) were these red lights floating out of the city. THEY WERE NOT DRONES. DRONES DONT FLY AS HIGH AS THESE WERE GOING. These bright red lights floated one by one into the highest point in the sky PASS THE CLOUDS. One by one they floated out of philly until there was about 25-30 of them hanging in the sky. THEN THESE LIGHTS FORMED A TRIANGLE AND DISAPPEARED!!!!! NOT A DRONE. People in other establishments in the area were outside recording on their phones and pedestrians stopped to stare and even cars on the r! oad stopped to stare..... YET NO ONE IS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BUT ME. LIKE EVERYONE HAS PLAYED BLIND TO IT, MAN THAT WAS SCARY AND I CANT LET THAT GO. SOMEONE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TELL ME YOU LIVE IN THE AREA AND SAW WHAT WE SAW.;39.8914;-75.1145999999999
