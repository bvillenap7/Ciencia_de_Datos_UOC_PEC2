8-10 very distant orbjects that looked like a star moving perfectly in a line with each other and vanishing. ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-01 21:00:00;5 min;8-10 very distant orbjects that looked like a star moving perfectly in a line with eachother and vanishing at the same spot in sky A few weeks ago i got home from work around 9pm est and noticed that the stars were really bright and the sky was clear.i noticed an object that looked just like a distant star. I took a second look and realized that they were moving in a straight line across the sky. perfectly spaced and symmetrical.  One after another.They all vanished at the same part in the sky. No flashing lights no sounds just a faint glow like a distant star.  i thought it was a satellite but when i saw another coming from the same path i knew it was not.  there were about 8-10 of these. i had enough time to run and get my wife/binoculars but the objects were so high up the binoculars did not help. 100% not a plane or any human made device considering how high up these were (not in our atmosphere high);40.9979;-74.2903
