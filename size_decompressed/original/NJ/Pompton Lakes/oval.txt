It then reappeared over my pool about 40 feet off the ground stopped and remained still for a couple of seconds then out to the left again, still no sound.  It was about 2.5 to 3 feet in length and about 1 foot in height in the middle,  I couldn’t tell top from bottom, no lights no wings no tail, no markings and no sound.  It’s color was light grayish blue like over cast sky.  This wasn’t a drone, I have 2 DJI phantoms and the kids up the street have the Mavic type drone and you hear them before you see them.  This thing was fast and Quiet.;40.9979;-74.2903
