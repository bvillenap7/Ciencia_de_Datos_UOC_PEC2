I saw a saucer metal shaped object, a metal I've never seen before, hovering in the sky, above the falls. It seemed to stand still, but shined bright from the reflection of the sun. As a group of trees hid the object for two seconds, I came back into a clearing and it had vanished. The object was brillant. It was in two sections. The shape was of a saucer. It was big. I never saw such a sight in my life. I new it was not of this world.;40.9979;-74.2903
saucer w/red and green blinking lights;2003-12-16 17:15:00;3-4 minutes;saucer w/red and green blinking lights my wife and son and I had just loaded up our Christmas tree and were driving north on hamburg tpk at around 5:15 pm(I believe the date of 12/16 is correct, although it might have been 12/17. there was no moon).  I was front passenger.  Glanced right and saw a red and a green blinking light seperated by and just below a greenish haze.  At first I thought an aircraft due to colored lights, and assumed green haze was a lit tail, as on commercial planes.  Planes around here often fly low.  However, after a minute I looked again and it seemed as if it had not moved.  Looking harder, I was sure it was stationary and maybe a tower.  Called wifes and sons attn. to lights.  Lights invisible from wifes angle.  Son confirmed lights stationary.  Asked wife to make a right, to check if lack of movement was only perspective.  1 block later we reaquired lights in sight and my 7 year old son yells it's a circle!, Dad, I'm scared.  I'm saying to myself, what the hell is that? when I see 4 cream colored lights in a semi-circle on bottom.  I rolled down the window and said again what the hell is that thing!? aloud. Just Then (!) the thing (I estimate an altitude of less than 300 feet) shoots approx. 1/2 mile east in less than .5 seconds, stops for maybe 2 sec's, then shoots away up and east at 45 degree angle and is gone, just like that. Next day wife's co-worker mentions he and 4 friends who live in condo's directly below sighting were outside smoking, and saw Exactly what we did at the Exact time. wife kept our sighting to herself.
