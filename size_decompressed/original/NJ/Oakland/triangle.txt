Travelling by car from Oakland, NJ to Fair Lawn, NJ on Route 208 South. (Actually So-East.) 208 runs from Oakland through Franklin Lakes then Wyckoff, Hawthorne, Glen Rock and Fair Lawn.  Through the front windshield I spotted an unusual object roughly triangular in shape ahead and to the left. It was daylight and the object was easily seen though quite small. I would guess it was maybe 1 to 2 miles high. There was a lot of rush hour traffic, especially in the opposite lane and I would guess it was seen by many others.  As I travelled through Wyckoff the object shifted more to my left due to my movement. The object did not appear to be moving but I could not detect its motion due to my own.  By the time I was in Hawthorne, still on 208, the object was off to my left, and it was closer to me. It somewhat resembled a tent with 2 'lines' hanging below it. I don't mean lines like a kite, but short lines dangling just below it.  I finally went passed it and had to turn my head up and back to the left to see it and it finally was too difficult to drive and look at the same time.  It was too high to be a kite, and resembled nothing I had ever seen in the sky before. It did not appear to be a hot-air baloon. That thought didn't even occur to me at the time.;41.0304;-74.2331
