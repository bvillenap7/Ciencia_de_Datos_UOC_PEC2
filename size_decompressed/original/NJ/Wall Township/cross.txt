Bright orange flying objects in sky.;2019-04-15 00:33:00;<1 minute;Bright orange flying objects in sky I was sitting in bed and heard a high pitched swirling noise.  I thought it could've been some aircraft landing in the field next to me.  I looked out the window and seen 2 bright orange glowing cross shaped flying objects best way I can describe the movements is dancing with each other cross crossing sort of.  I froze for a second and woke my boyfriend up and told him to look he did and said yup that's is very weird, I asked him what he thought it could be, but he said he had not a clue.  I ran out the room to my kids' room as they flew away really quickly and didn't see them again.  On a side note my cat meowed and laid next to my side before this happened and he does not do this  when I am going to bed he lays by my feet all the time.;40.1712;-74.0717
