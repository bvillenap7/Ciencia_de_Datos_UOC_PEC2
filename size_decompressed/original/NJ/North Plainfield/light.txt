Large blue light observed traveling at a slow steady course from north to south over northern New Jersey.;2014-04-11 23:00:00;4 minutes;Large blue light observed traveling at a slow steady course from north to south over northern New Jersey. Stepped out on to front porch at around 11 pm and saw a giant brilliant blue light through the clouds.  The weather condition is rainy, therefore the object was seen initially for only a few seconds.  Due to the brilliance of the light which was not bright as to see your shadow, but more like a deep blue that did not look natural causing me to be a bit fearful.   At the time of the incident, two passenger jets were observed flying somewhat within the proximity of the object.   I live not to far from Newark airport so this is a heavily air trafficked area.  I believe that those pilots would have seen this object.   The object did not make any sound as far as I could tell.   I continued to observe the object as best as I could see through the clouds for the next 4 minutes until lost.  It appeared that the object was traveling at a north to south direction and was on a strait steady course.   The object appeared large and like nothing I have ever seen before.;40.6327;-74.428
