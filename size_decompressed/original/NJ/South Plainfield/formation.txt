Bright lights in a triangular formation that did not move;2006-02-10 23:50:00;4-7 minutes;Bright lights in a triangular formation that did not move Me and my friends were were driving around in south plainfield when all of the sudden the sky flashed a greenish to purple color and the car shut off and would not start. i thought that the engine stalled out and my head lights blew out. thats when me and my friends saw these three bright lights in a triangular formation. they didnt move they just stayed in place. Out of no where the lights just vanished. it was the weirdest thing ive ever seen. I dont know what it was and im not sure i want to.;40.5837;-74.4136
