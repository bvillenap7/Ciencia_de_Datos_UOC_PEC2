large green orb with light trail appeared over South Plainfield;2005-11-25 21:31:00;2-3 seconds;large green orb with light trail appeared over South Plainfield As I was walking my dog at 9:31 PM I noticed a large bright green orb with a trail of bright green falling like a shooting star.  There was no sound and it appeared above me and disappeared behind the tree tops to the South-west of my location. It appeared to be falling in the direction of Piscataway NJ.  I thought that it could be a meteor except it was so large it was the size of the moon when it is huge and full in the sky.  It was a distinct circle just like as if the moon was falling out of the sky but it was a bright green color with a tail. It happened very fast.  There were about 4 or 5 airplanes traveling in different directions in the night sky at this time. I hope others witnessed this as well, Please let me know.;40.5837;-74.4136
