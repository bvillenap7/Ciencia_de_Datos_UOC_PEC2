Small black cone spotted floating over shopping center upon return to area, cone had disappeared.;2004-07-29 11:00:00;unknown;Small black cone spotted floating over shopping center upon return to area, cone had disappeared. As I came over an overpass on a busy road (Stelton Rd) I noticed a small black cone, point down, suspended in the air. As I approached, I noticed that it was positioned a couple hundred feet in the air over a shopping center (Middlesex Mall). The cone was small and featureless, no lights, etc, and I estimated that it would be too small to hold a human sized passenger. On the bottom of the cone was a small mass which tapered downward. It was absolutely still and made no sounds. I could see a small aircraft in the distance beyond the cone which was turning toward the cone in my line of sight. Whether or not it was trying to close in on the cone, I don't know, I didn't see it for long enough. I turned off the road and went around the block (no U-turns are possible). When I got back onto the road, the cone had disappeared entirely.;40.5837;-74.4136
