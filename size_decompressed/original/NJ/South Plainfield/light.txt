Two of us looked up as the sound came directly over us.  We saw two dimly lit, very small circular objects passing overhead approx 200-300 feet up in the sky, one following the other closely to the right.  They looked like they were moving behind clouds, but the sky was clear. They then vanished without a sound.  We all looked at each other and said that was no man made aircraft/sound, and quickly came to the conclusion that they had to be UFOâ€™s.
