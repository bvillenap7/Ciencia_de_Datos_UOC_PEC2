The light started out pretty small and condensed, and would flash outward every 7 seconds from a stationary spot (which was dark and invisible when not flashing).   Checked awhile later and the flash seemed to be dissipating outwards, kind of like a wave across the sky.  It looked like a searchlight, only the light seemed to be coming from above the clouds, and not from the ground. I did not see or hear any aircraft, and the origin location of the flash appeared stationary the entire time -- it just seemed to pan outwards further and become less bright.;40.5837;-74.4136
