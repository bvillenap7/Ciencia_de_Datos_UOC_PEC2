Driving Vehical going west on washinton road, looked up just at the right moment and saw a perfect black circle move from west to east right over the car in broad daylight.  It appeared to me like it had dipped below the cloud cover and then went back in. I blinked and almost shook my head thinking I saw something  That wasn’t really there.  But the more I kept thinking about it the rest of the drive I no doubt saw the almost Blacker than black object. I couldn’t tell you the size of it but from my view from the car window it could have been the size of a quarter moving over the window, at cloud cover height on sat the 8th of august 2014;40.4631;-74.3454999999999
