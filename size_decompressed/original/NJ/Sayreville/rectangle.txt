White Rectangular Object sighted near Sayreville Water Tower;2004-09-04 11:15:00;5 Minutes;White Rectangular Object sighted near Sayreville Water Tower I was driving north on Highway 9.  I looked to the east and noticed a white rectangular object floating sky.  I estimate that it was floating at an altitude of 1500 feet.  It appeared to be to the right of the water tower.  It resembled a bed sheet.  There were no lights or movement.  It was just floating.  At first I thought it might have been an advertisement banner, but there was no writing on it, nor was it being pulled by a plane.  I have never seen anything like this before.;40.4631;-74.3454999999999
