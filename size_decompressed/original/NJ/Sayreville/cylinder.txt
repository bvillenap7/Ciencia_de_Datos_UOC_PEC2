Cylinder with round top and blue lights, in the sky above route 9 south jughandle;2000-07-15 01:00:00;30 seconds;Cylinder with round top and blue lights, in the sky above route 9 south jughandle It was early morning, not sure of the exact date, but I believe it was summer and sometime between 1999 And 2001.  I was on the phone with the my boyfriend ( at the time, now my husband) and was traveling south on 287.  I approached my exit for route 9 south and had just passed under the riverside dr bridge to get onto the jughandle.  Just as I passed under the bridge I noticed bright lights above me.  I was still driving so I was trying to keep my eyes on the road also.  The object looked like a can but with a round top and the bottom had light blue lights in a circular shape underneath it.  As I had said I was on the phone with my boyfriend and telling him this as it was happening (he thought I was nuts!).  Anyway by the time I had made my way around the jughandle to the top of the bridge, it was gone.  I have looked at sites about sightings and I haven't found anyone who has ever seen the same thingâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.4631;-74.3454999999999
