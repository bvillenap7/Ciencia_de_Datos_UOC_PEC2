2 orange hazes scrambling across the sky.;2002-11-18 22:00:00;45seconds;2 orange hazes scrambling across the sky. I was outside with my wife. I looked up at the sky at what I thought was the big dipper. I thought to myself that it looked kind of weird. Then I noticed what I thought were 2 stars appear to be slowly moving. They appeared to be as high as the stars. (Not airplane height but way higher)The 2 stars appeared to be 2 orange hazes lights moving parallel with each other. Than it stopped, suddenly shot foward again parallel, than stopped again. The 2 lights started to circle each other (like a figure eight pattern) Than they shot across the sky again, stopping and zig-zagging. Both lights staying close with in each other. I told my wife to look up I think its a ufo. See couldn't find the lights and they began to zig-zag, stop and go & disappeared. I thought I was seeing things, but I know I saw something, But what? I have chills as I write this. It was not a satelite, meteor or airplane.;40.4631;-74.3454999999999
New Jersey Sayreville massive light in cloudy night sky not moving, stationary for 30 min then disappeared at 9pm.;2019-09-05 21:05:00;30 minutes +;New Jersey Sayreville massive light in cloudy night sky not moving, stationary for 30 min then disappeared at 9pm. On my porch outside, cloudy night NE sky, a light illuminating through clouds like a full moon does when clouds move across its magnificent light, but it's not the moon.  The moon is a quarter moon, and is in SW sky.  The light was noticed at approx. 9 pm lasted until 9:25.  It was stationary the entire time.  Then the light disappeared.  Went off like a switch.   While it was lit it was an intense light about the size of a full moon.  The light was never moving at all!;40.4631;-74.3454999999999
