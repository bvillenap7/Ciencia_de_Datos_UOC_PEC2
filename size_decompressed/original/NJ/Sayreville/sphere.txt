Orange red lights in sky above sayreville NJ;2012-06-06 23:00:00;15 minutes;orange red lights in sky above sayreville NJ my fiancee and I were out on our balcony when I spotted in the sky a orange reddish sphere traveling very fast through the sky.  There were no strobe or white or blue or green lights just a fire orange glow. It then vanished from sight.  While we were still in shock a second one appeared and this one stopped and hovered for a few seconds before vanishing.  I ran down to my car to grab my camera and a third one appeared this one I got on video and when it vanished an airplane came into view in a different part of the sky so I recorded that as well for comparison.  They are clearly very different objects.;40.4631;-74.3454999999999
