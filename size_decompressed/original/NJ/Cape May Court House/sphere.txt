It seemed to cover a lot of distance in a matter of just a couple of seconds coming to a complete halt. The object appeared to be several thousand feet in the air probably somewhere over the Deleware Bay and it dropped at an alarming rate coming to a complete stop in mid-air. It then changed directions moving from left to right or from south to north at the same rate of speed again halting in mid-air. The first object then disappeared. I was driving my car down Oyster Rd. in CMCH at the time and hit the breaks to get a better look at these objects.  Recently, I would guess about 14 months ago, I saw the same style of object behave in that same manner again over the Del. Bay as I was driving west on Indian Trail Rd. toward Rte. 47. That time it was about 10:30 pm. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
