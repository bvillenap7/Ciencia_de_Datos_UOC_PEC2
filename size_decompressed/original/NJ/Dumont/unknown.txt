flashing lights changing directions and hovering and changing colors;2006-12-21 22:00:00;0:40;flashing lights changing directions and hovering and changing colors Facing due east, one set of red lights moved northeast while one set of white lights moved southwest.  Both sets of lights changed cadence several times and reversed colors (the red lights became white and the white lights became red).  This same pattern continued for approximately 40 minutes with periods of hovering.  A third white, bright light streaked somewhat slowly in a southwest direction.  This third object started in the middle of the other two objects and then appeared to burn out or disappear as it approached the treetops.  It looked like a shooting star but burned much brighter, travelling far slower and over a shorter distance than a typical shooting star.  No sounds were audible at all unlike helicopters and airplanes which emit a distinct sound as they pass by.  My wife witnessed the same experiences at the same time.  We tried to videotape the event but the camera lost power right after I turned it on and attempted to zoom the lens.  The battery was half-full when I turned it on.;40.9419;-73.9957
