bright object that stopped in mid air and backed up.;2007-01-01 01:30:00;2 minutes;bright object that stopped in mid air and backed up. My Mother, Her boyfriend, and I were riding home from a new years eve. party we were turning on to NewJersey Avenue 0ff of River Road.  When suddenly I pointed out a big bright light in the sky.  I told them it couldn't be a plane nor a helicopter because it would of blinded  another plane in front of it which would make it go off course. I suggested we would park on the side of the street for a minute suddenly when we stopped the light stopped and pointed right toward us so then i was joking around and said wouldn't that be scary if it backed up in mid air which planes can't do  and suddenly it backed up in mid air and drove the other way quicker then what a plane could do.;40.0305;-74.9528
