Two large Fireballs slowly moving south to north 11-24-11;2011-11-24 19:50:00;5 mins;Two large Fireballs slowly moving south to north 11-24-11 We observed 2 rather large orange fireballs traveling south to north in the sky directly overhead.  Moving slowly and looking like burning fireballs, growing brighter and dimmer and brighter as they traveled. Moving relatively slow, not like a meteor, too slow and yet faster then a air force jet.  They did not seem to come towards the earth, but appeared to be passing by in space?  One of our witnesses seen two more 20 mins later, same area and projection of travel.;40.0305;-74.9528
