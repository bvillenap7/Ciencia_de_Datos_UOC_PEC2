This morning I saw a small plane flying low in the sky toward the North. About 2 fingers distance to the West I saw a bright light that was moving  upward and curving slightly at a rapid speed a leaving a trail. It almost looked like a rocket burning in the sky (there were flashes of yellow and red almost like a burst) but it came out of nowhere and as quickly as it came it disappeared. At first I thought it was a shooting star but it went upward and it was too large and too close to be a star.;40.7873;-74.3211000000001
