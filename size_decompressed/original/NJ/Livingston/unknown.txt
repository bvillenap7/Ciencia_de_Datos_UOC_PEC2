Security Guard Claims UFO Sighting at Mall;2008-01-17 04:30:00;Unknown;Reported in the 01/31/2008 edition of the West Essex Tribune - the weekly local newspaper in Livingston, NJ.  (Page A-5)  Date of incident was not disclosed however it is assumed to have occurred within the past week.  I believe that this could possibly be same object observed in New Providence, NJ on 01/17/2008 (posted on this site) as it would be in a time period consistent within the printing of weekly news and New Providence is fairly nearby.  It should also be noted that there are several water reservoirs in this area.  Security Guard Claims UFO Sighting at Mall  A security guard patrolling the parking lot at the Livingston Mall reported an early morning sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO).  (Name deleted) told police that he had been patrolling the outside parking area near lot 24 at about 4:30 a.m. when he noticed a UFO in the sky.  The huge object, (name deleted) reported, had multi-lights in rainbow colors consistently spinning.  The security guard said that the object made no noise and was exceedingly large in size.  He said that the light stanchion in the parking lot was the size of a strand of hair in comparison to the object in the sky, which also had a dome shape on one side.  Livingston police responded to the scene and reported that they were unable to see anything in the cloudy night sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event may be approximate.

Size of a star, moving slower than a plane, no noise, could see  blatant small reflection from the moon, looked like a moving star and I watched it fade quickly into the black sky.  This was not a plane, no blinking lights, no colored lights and was up in space!  This is the second time I've witnessed something like this.;40.7873;-74.3211000000001
