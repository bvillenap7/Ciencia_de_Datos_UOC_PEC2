just star gazing and 1 star was moving;1999-09-30 21:00:00;about 1 min.;just star gazing and 1 star was moving i was looking up at the stars as i do every night when i take the dog out.then i noticed one of the more distant stars moving.it was moving at a costant speed.traveling from the southeast and heading northwest in a straight line.it's brightness remained the same during my view and i did not see any tail or vapor trail.this was for sure no airplane! ((NUFORC Note:  Except for the assumed direction of flight, this report seems reminiscent of a sighting of a satellite in polar orbit.  Difficult to know for sure, of course.));40.7873;-74.3211000000001
