Fast moving white ball of light no trail.;2020-07-25 21:49:00;5 seconds;Fast moving white ball of light no trail. A fast-moving white ball of light appeared out of nowhere.  It was as bright as a full moon, however it was small in size.  Low in altitude. Moving 25 degrees NE to 115 degrees SE.  Before I could get out of my chair to see it as it passed my neighbors home it was gone.  Where I believed it's flight path would follow it wasn't there.  The object made no sound.;40.9049;-74.0595
