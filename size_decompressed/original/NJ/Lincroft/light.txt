Light fluctuating and darting across the sky while blinking a red light.;2013-02-10 03:35:00;10-24 minutes;Light fluctuating and darting across the sky while blinking a red light. I saw a white light in the sky that had a flashing red light.  This light continued to move in many different direction around a central point.   Over the duration of the sighting, the light gradually moved across the sky with some intervals of quick darting movements.  I used a tree as a stationary pouts to gauge the movement of the light (to make sure my head was not the cause of the fluctuations).   After a while, I got another person to look and see what I was seeing.  This person described to me exactly what I was seeing without my previous telling them.   At that point I knew what was going on and that what it was is beyond my comprehension.  When 10-24 minutes had passed the craft made some sharp and distinct movements before moving out of my line of sight.
