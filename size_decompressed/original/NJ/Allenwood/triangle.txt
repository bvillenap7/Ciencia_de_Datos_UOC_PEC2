Triangle, rainbow lights over Garden State Parkway.;2012-11-14 17:30:00;30 seconds;Triangle, rainbow lights over Garden State Parkway I was driving south on the Garden State Parkway around 5:30 pm when I saw the object.  I left Woodbridge NJ at 5:10 pm and headed south.    Just past exit 98 (Allenwood/Belmar/Pt Pleasant/Wall) exit I saw what appeared to be a plane in the distance.   As it came closer, I saw it had a bright white light and a royal blue light.  It flew right over my car, triangular in shape, silent.   It was closer than any plane could fly to the road.   It was slow, then as it came over towards my car I could see the lights underneath glowing in a rainbow sequence.   It was definitely a triangle.  Never saw anyting like this before.  I was driving so I was not able to take a picture. People drivng were stepping on their brakes so I can not be the only person who saw this.;40.1423;-74.1131
