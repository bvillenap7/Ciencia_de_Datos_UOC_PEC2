Blimp-like object with a very LOUD engine/motor hovered over Morganville/Marlboro, NJ last night.  ((NUFORC Note:  Blimp??  PD));2012-02-07 19:30:00;20 minutes;Blimp-like object with a very LOUD engine/motor hovered over Morganville/Marlboro, NJ, last night. An object hovered a few thousand feet over Morganville/Marlboro, NJ.   I thought it was a blimp because you could hear an engine/motor/propellers and it was VERY, VERY loud.   I could not make out the complete shape, but it had 3 or 4 lights in a triangle formation, which were blinking revealing parts of the sides of the craft.   After maybe 20 minutes, it slowly moved across the sky towards the west. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Possible blimp??
