PD));2009-02-23 19:15:00;1 hour 20 minutes;a very bight shaped object slowly moving over the western sky   Hi,  I live in Monmonth couty NJ. Today is Feb 23,2009.  At about 7:15 pm I saw a very bright object over the western sky. It was about 40 degree above the horizon. I used a telescope to look and found it has a shpae of arc, the entire body is very brigth. It definetly is not a plane (moving too slow) and not a star or planet (moving too fast). Now is 8:20 pm, the brigth object is still over the sky, but about 15 degree above the horizon. I asked my wife and a couple of friends to look, all they saw it and feel strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?  PD));40.3496;-74.2849000000001
