Large, Still, Silent, Hovering Triangular Craft.  19 Miles West of New York City;2011-02-10 06:00:00;2 minutes;Large, Still, Silent, Hovering Triangular Craft.  19 Miles West of New York City Last year I was leaving for work at precisely 6am.  It was still dark.  I live 19 miles due west of New York City, in an area that is still relatively undeveloped.  As I got to the stop sign I noticed that my neighbor’s house (on seven, predominantly wooded acres) was illuminated.  Directly above the house (a one story ranch) was a large triangular craft hovering not more than 30-40’ over his roof.  (He is 90 years old, and I have not heard that he was ever aware of it.)  It was silent and still.   Although I regret not going back for my camera or getting out of the car, my instinct was to get away so I turned right and started up the hill.  But I made a point of looking  at the craft closely.  It,  . It was an isosceles triangle, . The light emanating from it was white and bright,  . It had three large, blindingly bright round lights in each of the corners and rows of smaller, round lights running along all three sides  of the bottom,  . The side had vertical slats running from the roof to the bottom edge (like the old World Trade Center),  . It was only about 10-15’ high,  . It was shining a weak beam of light onto my neighbor’s property (close to the old pond),  My neighbor’s property abuts electric power lines that  I understand shelter a  natural gas pipeline.  As I drove up the hill and lost sight of the craft above my neighbor’s house I looked to my left.  A a second triangular craft was hovering above a power line tower about a 1/2 a mile in the distance.  This one, however, had no lights on.  I just saw a dark gray triangle juxtaposed above a lighter gray sky.  I would have reported this last February, but I only recently became familiar with your site.;40.852;-74.2842
