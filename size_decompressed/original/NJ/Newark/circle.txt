Strange flickering lights over Newark, NJ;2009-10-06 02:40:00;30 Minutes;Strange flickering lights over Newark, NJ I went to the back porch of my apartment to grab a smoke and as i am sitting on a chair looking out the window i see a object flickering in the clear night sky. It is not the first time i see this object it would always appear every night, never fails and always between the hours of 12AM and 3AM. The object appears to be a sphere with flickering multi color lights from the distance that i am viewing it from. I knw its not a plane or a star for the simple fact that an actual airplane would pass by and you could clearly tell the diffrence from it and you could tell the diffrence from a star for the simple fact its the only object flickering multi color lights and the stars around it are as normal as they should be. I tried video taping it but my camera would simply not reach the distance. The object would move at a steady but slow pace, and judging from the distance of my view it would ruffly move 5 inches south every 5-10 minutes. I see this object every nigh! t and it does worry me. I am a strong beleiver that we are not the only ones in this world. It would be great if someone explains to me what is there to hide.;40.7332981994462;-74.1835882271469

At first glance it appeared to be stationary, and looked like a large twinkling star without a focus aid.  But, when aided,  it looks round with bright light and also appears to make quick movements upwards, downwards, and returning to the same position.  It appears round, white with bluish light emitting on occasion.  At 02:40 hrs, It still remains in the sky at even a higher altitude.  This craft has moved over this time span but is still visible.  It seems like air traffic i.e. airplanes,  seem to be normal/uninterrupted. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
