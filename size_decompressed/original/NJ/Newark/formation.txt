Amazing Siting;2001-07-15 00:30:00;5 minutes;Amazing Siting It all happened on July 15 at 12:30 A.M. on the New Jersey turnpike just about 1 mile from Newark airport.  There was 15-20 non flashing lights gathered together.  My boyfreind said it was planes but as we were driving they did not move at all in the sky. They were not stars nor plane lights so as we continued to drive there were cars lined up along the shoulers on the turnpike.  So then we pulled over along the shoulder to.  We got out of the car and looked up into the sky and stood there for about 3 minutes looking at the circular lights above us.  Cars were pulled all over for at least a 1/2 mile in front of us and a 1/2 mile in back of us. We spoke with the people behind us and the people in front of us.  We all were saying it was the crazist thing we have ever seen.  Then the lights started to disappear slowly going upward and then there were two lights left and they just disappeared to.;40.7332981994462;-74.1835882271469
