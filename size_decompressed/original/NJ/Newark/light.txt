A bright light with a tail, like a fireworks, flew east to west across the highway, between 100 and 500 feet elevation??, distance ??;1997-06-12 21:45:00;5 seconds;Summary : A bright light with a tail, like a fireworks, flew east to west across the highway, between 100 and 500 feet elevation??, distance ?? This appeared to be single fireworks rocket, but it travelled horizontally. My wife and both children saw it. It lasted just a few seconds. The fact that it was traveling horizontally was what made it unusual. It's height and distance were difficult to judge, but I would guess that it was no more than 2 miles away, between 100 and 500 feet elevation. The light was yellow, it did not appear very large. The tail was yellow and white.;40.7332981994462;-74.1835882271469
Rolling strobe lights over Newark;2010-12-20 19:00:00;10 min;Rolling strobe lights over Newark We were driving down the highway about 10 miles west of Newark heading east.  We spotted two very bright (but off white) round lights very close together in the sky.  It alarmed us because it looked nothing like any airplane lights we'd ever seen.  It seemed to be barely moving.   All of the sudden, the lights went out and bright strobe type lights started rolling in a pattern from left to right (about 10 lights).  The speed accelerated and we couldn't keep it in our site for long as it zipped across the sky.  It was dark and we were driving so we could not make out a shape....only lights.;40.7332981994462;-74.1835882271469
Sighting of colorful lights in the morning sky;2011-10-13 03:30:00;10 seconds;Sighting of colorful lights in the morning sky On October 13, 2011, at about 3:30 in the morning is when I saw strange colorful lights through my window.  At first I thought it was police cars outside but the lights were a lot of different colors.  There was a mixture of purple, pink, blue and other colors but those are the main ones that I remember.  As I was about to look out the window to see what it was my husband woke up.  Our bed is next to the window so as soon as he opened his eyes he saw that there was a beam of light coming from the sky.  It lasted about 10 seconds and then disappeared.
