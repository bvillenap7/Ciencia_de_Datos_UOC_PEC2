Oval-shaped glow sitting over Newark skyline;2004-09-03 22:45:00;5 minutes;Oval-shaped glow sitting over Newark skyline I am a 44-year-old male and work in New York City as a book production editor for a prominent scientific publishing company. On the night of my sighting, I was a passenger being driven south on the New Jersey Turnpike, and as we passed by Newark Airport, between Exits 14 and 13, I looked west toward Newark. In the distance over the skyline, about 30 degrees from the horizon, was a slightly oval-shaped glow that had about the same size, color, and intensity as a full moon being obscured by clouds. It could not have been the moon, however, because it did not change shape or intensity at all, as would have been the case if it were being obscured by moving clouds. Moreover, the moon that night was a half moon. This object just sat there in one spot, unchanging for the entire time I viewed it. It did not look like a helicopter or blimp, and it clearly was not an airplane.;40.7332981994462;-74.1835882271469
