Five shifting fire ball objects heading west from New Jersey;2003-01-21 17:30:00;15 minutes;Five shifting fire ball objects heading west from New Jersey I was heading home from NYC at approximately 5:30pm on the bus, heading south on the I-95 on a clear evening.  At around Newark, exit 13A, which is also the location of Newark International Airport, I saw five fire balls with a tail heading west towards Pennsylvania.  At first I thought it was meteors.  I continued to look.  Then these apparent objects shifted its position in a way that would rule out meteors.  These objects flew much higher than any plane I ever saw.  As they passed over the airport, airplanes were either taking off or landing. As my bus continued south, I could see these objects shifting side to side but heading west.  The person sitting next to me, a total stranger also saw these lights and could not explain what they could be.;40.7332981994462;-74.1835882271469
Around 2:45 AM driving by Branch Brook Park Newark, NJ. Spotted red firey/glowing object slowly coming down traveling SE.;2011-07-05 02:45:00;2-3 minutes;Around 2:45 AM driving by Branch Brook Park, Newark, NJ, spotted red firey/glowing object slowly coming down traveling South/East  It was NOT fireworks.   As it traveled it slowly faded/and decreased in size, until it shrank to look like a dot, then it zipped up in like an arc motion and disappeared.  Just wondering if there were anymore reports or witnesses. Events like this happen always when you have no camera on hand   :-(;40.7332981994462;-74.1835882271469

large Reddish White fireball coming through the foggy sky near Newark Airport.;2013-11-17 18:45:00;7 seconds;large Reddish White fireball coming through the foggy sky near Newark Airport. On November 17th at 18:45 driving off exit 14 heading on to Route 78 west we saw a large Reddish White fireball coming through the foggy sky, going very fast on a 45 degree angle heading towards Newark airport. It was very foggy that night yet we could still see this object.  My wife thought it might hit a plane that was landing.   After I passed the toll we could see a large tail of smoke in the foggy shy.  What was a little weird was that the line was not straight but zigzagged back and forth.  I checked the news and no one else reported this sighting.   My observation was that it might be a Meteor.;40.7332981994462;-74.1835882271469
