Green laser lights in the sky simutaneosly and evenly shooting parallel to each other;2012-02-25 06:20:00;1 minute;Green laser lights in the sky simutaneosly and evenly shooting parallel to eachother It was approximately 0620 hrs  and I was looking in the sky I noticed 2 geese flying together which was weird I usually see geese in the bundles...  I thought nothing much after I lt sort of followed the geese with my eyes I turned and that's  when I saw what I saw it was shocking but exciting at the same time I saw a light which was white really bright not like a plane and it wasn't blinking then like 3 seconds later I sort of took of straight and while it did that the  light turned green as if there was a green laser it was super fast so fast I couldn't keep up with it with my eyes no plain or jet is that fast I have common sense but after that I saw something even more surprising I saw another similar light coming in the opposite direction as the other one before it and then I saw two of the same white lights going left to right simultaneously with the green laser looking thing there's no aircraft in the world that can go that fast and turn back 180degrees! instantly back and forth that fast it was beautiful it was like some thing you see in a movie after several seconds it just vanished in the air  it sounds funny but that's what  I saw and not only that this isn't the first time I've seen it I've seen it years ago about maybe 9 years ago coming out a factory in the early morning by again a green laser looking UFO flying back and forth then disappears I wasn't the only one who saw it actually about 4-6 other people saw it I was scared to say something but this time I googled how to report a UFO sighting which lead me to this form  I hope other people saw it To.. Thanx;40.7332981994462;-74.1835882271469
UFO'S in Newark, NJ.;2017-01-13 01:00:00;30 minutes;UFO'S in Newark, NJ 1/31/17 AT 1:00A.M.EST.  I heard a humming sound.  I thought it was my heating unit, but then a light shined in my bedroom.  I looked out the window and in the sky was 2 lights with a red light in between the 2 white light.  The white lights looked light 2 eyes with a red nose.  I thought it was a drone.  But then it started to head in the direction of my room.  As it got closer, the humming sound eased up.  All I said was this looks like eyes looking at me. It flew over my home, but then in a matter of seconds it reappeared in the original location, that I saw it in.  All of a sudden, the eyes split apart and this red like tail curved like a snake into one little red light.   At that point I told myself I'm not loosing my mind. I truly didn't sleep well.  At 1000 a.m. est, I got online and started to read UP ON UFO SIGHTINGS.  I told a few people and they said I was crazy.;40.7332981994462;-74.1835882271469
