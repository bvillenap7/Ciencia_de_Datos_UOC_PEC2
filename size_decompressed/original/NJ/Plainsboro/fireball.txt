2 fireball shapes over a farm in nj;2012-08-23 01:47:00;10 seconds;2 fireball shapes over a farm in nj I was driving on a dark farm road in plainsboro nj at 1:47am. I looked over to my left and there i saw 2 fireball looking shapes they flew over the farm then zoomed away in the blink of an eye.  I had to pullover and catch my breath and to see if it came back but it didn't..;40.3292;-74.5691
