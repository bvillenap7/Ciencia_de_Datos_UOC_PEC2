Daylight sighting of cigar-shaped object;1991-03-01 08:00:00;2minutes;Daylight sighting of cigar-shaped object My husband and I were taking our daily walk around the circle of a state park when we looked up and saw a white cigar-shaped object with a sort of black line undulating from front to back.  We just watched it silently fly from one side of the sky to the other. ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from same witness.  We have spoken with the witness, and she sounded quite credible to us.  PD));41.0937;-74.271
