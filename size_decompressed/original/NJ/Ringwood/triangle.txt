Triangular aircraft sighted from Virginia to NY State in '78;1978-12-09 19:00:00;3minutes;Triangular aircraft sighted from Virginia to NY State in '78 I remember the date because it was my birthday, but the year may be off by a year or two.  It can be checked because it was reported from Virginia to New York State in the newspapers and evening news on TV.   My mother, father, brother and I were watching the NY Rangers on TV when my brother noticed lights coming towards our house.  At first, we all thought they were just planes in formation.  But, Mom, my brother and I all ran outside to take a look.  As we stood on our sidewalk, this UFO slowly, silently flew just above the trees.  It was going so slow for such a huge object that it was hard to believe it could stay in the air.  The three of us just stared up at this object as it ever so slowly flew right over us.  It really looked like it was just missing the treetops, it was so low.   It was black underneath, triangular in shape with, as I remember, 5 lights.  One in the front, and two on each side.  It also looked like there was some sort of round opening in the middle that was closed shut.  It couldn't have been more than 100 feet directly above us.  That night, it was reported on the news. ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from same witness.  We have spoken with the witness, and she sounded quite credible to us.  The witness is going to check newspapers, in order to determine the precise date.  PD));41.0937;-74.271
