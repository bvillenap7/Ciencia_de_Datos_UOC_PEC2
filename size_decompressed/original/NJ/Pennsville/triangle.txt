Metallic green right triangle in the middle of nowhere.;2008-08-15 21:00:00;5-10 minutes;Metallic green right triangle in the middle of nowhere. My report took place roughly 5 months ago. It took place at Salem County, New Jersey. It took place at my house. My home is on a dead-end street and surrounded by woods. It was about 9 or 10 oâ€™clock at night. I took my dog out to go to the bathroom. Roughly after a minute when I was outside I looked into the sky which I noticed an object flying really low.  The object was a greenish metallic, right triangle. It was roughly 50-75 feet above my head and made no noise. It flew over my head and into the woods away from me at a very slow speed. The object had white and yellow lights that formed at each point. Also I noticed the object had a very intricate design under it as it flew by. When I saw the object instantly a feeling of deep fear and concern came over me. All I could do was look. As soon as the point of the ship hit the woods I collected my dog and went inside.
