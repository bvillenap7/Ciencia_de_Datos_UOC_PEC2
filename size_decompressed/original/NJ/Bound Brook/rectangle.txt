Large rectangular, gray, static craft spotted in Bound Brook, NJ while driving on 287 South around 3:00pm on 8/30/09.;2009-08-30 15:00:00;5 minutes;Large rectangular, gray, static craft spotted in Bound Brook, NJ while driving on 287 South around 3:00pm on 8/30/09. Driving on 287 South on Sunday, August 30 at approximately 3:00pm, my boyfriend and I witnessed an extremely large, rectangular, mechanical craft to the west of us.   There were two other smaller crafts, about 1/20 of the size of the large rectangular craft, hovering at each end above it.   All three were gray-colored, apparently made of metal. We tried to get off 287 South at the next exit and drive west toward it, but were unable to locate it again, having our sight blocked by trees.  We drove north and got back on 287 South, hoping to see it again in the same place we had the first time, but it was gone 30 minutes later.  There seemed to be a number of other airplanes and helicopters flying in the vicinity around this time.   One all-white unmarked airplane was seen flying away from where we had seen the 3 crafts (1 large, and 2 smaller).;40.5704;-74.5369
