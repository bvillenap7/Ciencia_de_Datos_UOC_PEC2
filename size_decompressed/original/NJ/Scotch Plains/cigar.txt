UFO Sighting in Central NJ;2008-08-03 22:00:00;2 sec;UFO Sighting in Central NJ My family and i were sitting outside on our deck in scotch plains, nj around 10pm.  Out of nowhere we see a thin rectangular, lit-up white, object in the sky above the houses in the distance.  It was moving very, very fast (faster than any airplane or meteor) with an emerald green-ish light trail, and no sounds at all were emitted.  All of a sudden it lit up the sky around it to a daylight and was gone in an instant.;40.6368;-74.3726999999999
