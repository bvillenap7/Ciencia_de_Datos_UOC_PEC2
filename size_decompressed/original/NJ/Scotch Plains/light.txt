Spotlight over new jersey.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 20:30:00;45 seconds;Spotlight over new jersey I'm not sure of the time of the event.  There were 4 of us who saw it.  We were eating dinner on our patio at night.  I looked up and saw what looked like a spot light shining down from the sky through a mist or a cloud.  I pointed it out.  First reaction, rational, was that it was a helicopter.   We heard no sound of a helicopter at all, and the light seemed to high up to be a helicopter, especially given the fact that it seemed to be emanating from a cloud.  About 20 seconds later, the light seemed to rise straight up, getting enveloped in the cloud.  I say this because the light became diffused as if in a cloud of mist.  Eventually it dimmed and was no longer visible. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.
