Twelve dots moving in formation 20 miles southwest of Manhattan;2015-04-26 19:10:00;5 minutes;Twelve dots moving in formation 20 miles southwest of Manhattan On 26 April 2015 at 7:10pm, in full daylight before the sun began to set, I saw a large grouping of 12 white or silver dots pass slowly east, beneath the daytime half moon.   The leading three dots held steady in the shape of a large right triangle.  I could not tell if the other 9 held a pattern or moved around slightly, due to their faintness and some light wispy clouds. Viewing them through binoculars did not reveal any details, still just bright dots.  I could not tell if they were mylar balloons, but they probably werenâ€™t birds because the formation was moving too slowly. The sighting lasted about five minutes as the lights moved slowly and very steadily toward the eastern horizon, until they were no longer visible. I live about 20 miles southwest of Manhattan, and this was very similar to the mass sighting there on 13 October 2010.;40.6368;-74.3726999999999
