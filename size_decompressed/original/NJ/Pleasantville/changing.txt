single boomerang shape quickly turned into 6 smaller semi-circular lights over Pleasantville NJ;2008-08-26 19:50:00;45 seconds;single boomerang shape quickly turned into 6 smaller semi-circular lights over Pleasantville NJ I was driving east on the Black Horse Pike in Pleasantville NJ at approximately 7:50 PM when I noticed a bright solid white light boomerang shape high in the sky.   This disappeared and quickly re-appeared as 6 small semi-circular individual lights which appeared to be blinking.    This same boomerang shape then re-appeared in a different location in the sky, quickly disappearing and then the 6 small semi-circular lights appeared again.  This process repeated itself one more time in yet another location and then was not seen again.   It should be noted that the sighting was not in a pattern contestant with a modern day air plane since the flight pattern was not a straight line but rather back and forth in motion.   There was cloud cover but the object was flying under the clouds.  My estimate on the altitude would be 10,000 feet and the distance away from Pleasantville would be approximately 6 miles.   The boomerang appeared to be about the size of my hand and the 6 small semi-circular lights appeared to be about the length of my arm.
