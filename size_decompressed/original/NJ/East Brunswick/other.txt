Stange dark winged objects circling over Rt 18.;2012-06-25 19:10:00;3-5 minutes;Stange dark winged objects circling over Rt 18. While leaving a shopping mall I noticed two what I thought were buzzards circling about 1000 ft up, below the clouds.  I was driving on Rt 18 heading south and as I came closer I noticed these dark winged objects would reflect a bright metallic  silver light every so often, mainly when changing direction.The part that reflected was sperical in shape.  They didn't move fast,about the same movement as a hawk would only would move down, bank, then move sharply upward.I could see horizontal wings but they had smaller verticle wings on the ends of them. I pulled into a parking lot to get a better veiw and noticed one was not visible.  I got my camera and took a few shots of the one, but it was moving away south towards Spotswood and may be too hard to make out.  (Have to get film developed)  The one that was left was moving agaist the wind, so it wasn't a baloon as far as I could tell.

Four objects change positions continually while flying across the sky.;2014-06-05 17:12:00;85 seconds;Four objects change positions continually while flying across the sky Objects came out from behind cloud on the right and moved across the sky changing there positions.   The total time the object was visible (1min 25 sec), before they disappeared into another cloud on the left, and I did not see them any more.   I could tell the objects were not Geese since I did not see any flapping wings, or long necks.  The bodies were just like any normal plane, but they did not move like a plane.  They were much faster and could move with ease into the various patterns.   I do not know if there was an air show and if these were some sort of a team of professional fliers that perform like the Blue Angles or Thunderbirds.;40.4306070422535;-74.4020577464789
