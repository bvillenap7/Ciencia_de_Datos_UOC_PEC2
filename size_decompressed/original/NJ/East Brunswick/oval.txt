Shiny Oval Shape UFO sighting in East Brunswick, NJ on Sept 25, 2016.;2016-09-25 14:00:00;10 seconds;Shiny Oval Shape UFO sighting in East Brunswick, NJ, on Sept 25, 2016. I was driving East bound of Cranbury Road East Brunswick on Sunday of Sept. 25, 2016. I have noticed that shiny oval shape object was flying toward left.  At the same time there were commercial planes in the sky and I definitely can tell the difference between UFO from the planes. After about 10 seconds it disappeared...just like that. I was projecting the path and try to follow thinking it went behind the cloud but... It just disappeared... no cloud either.;40.4306070422535;-74.4020577464789
