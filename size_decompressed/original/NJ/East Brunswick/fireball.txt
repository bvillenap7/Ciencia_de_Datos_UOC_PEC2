stationary bright fireball seen along the treeline;2006-04-28 22:55:00;20 seconds;stationary bright fireball seen along the treeline Large bright red light seen coming from behind some trees, close to the horizon. Maybe 2-3 degrees above true horizon. I moved my head back and forth to try to catch a better glimpse through the trees. The light remained constantly bright, was stationary and seemed to be very far away, however was quite large, if I were to measure it with my thumb at arms length,  about the tip of the thumb to the first joint. It disappeared behind the trees. It was definitely not an airplane. The lights were the same color as red lights on top buildings, but it was not flashing at all, and no buildings exist in that direction tall enough to be seen. I was looking out of my 2nd story window when I saw it.;40.4306070422535;-74.4020577464789
