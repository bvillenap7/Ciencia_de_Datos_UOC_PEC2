Small circular object silver and black, moves across sky, hovers then disappears.;2006-05-06 14:30:00;5 minutes;Small circular object silver and black, moves across sky, hovers then disappears. While working at the Brunswick Square Mall i stepped out to have a cig.  The flight path for Newark Liberty takes approching and departing plane very low over the mall.   So low that you can easily see what airline the planes belong too.   While watching one go overhead i noticed a small circular object dark on the bottom silver on top floating some altitude above the plane, high enough that the object was not effected when the plane crossed by it.  I followed the object which moved slowly across the sky for several minutes.   Then the object stopped and hovered in one spot for about 3 minutes, then it simply disappared and i could no longer locate it.;40.4306070422535;-74.4020577464789
