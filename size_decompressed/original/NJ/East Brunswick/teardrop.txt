Tear-drop shaped UFO over central New Jersey.;2000-11-19 16:35:00;two minutes;Tear-drop shaped UFO over central New Jersey. Me and my associate were emptying cardboard in the rear of the store where we work, when we both saw a round, black object come over the trees to our west.At first we thought it was a large balloon, but as it got nearer, we could see a definite tear drop shape to the object. The altitude of the object was below one thousand feet, and as it got directly overhead it tilted it's nose toward us, showing a flattened shape and two fins running from nose to tail. The craft then righted itself, then wobbled from side to side as it continued on toward the east. It was travelling faster than a balloon would, especially since there was very light wind at the time. It was black in color, and we could not see any markings or windows on it, but I am very familiar with all known aircraft, have a very open mind, and I can state with certainty that this was not a known aircraft. The object appeared to be approximately thirty feet in length and made no noise.;40.4306070422535;-74.4020577464789
