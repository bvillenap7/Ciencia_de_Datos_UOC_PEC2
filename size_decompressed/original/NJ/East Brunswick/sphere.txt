PD));2011-08-28 11:30:00;1 hour;We saw a shpere like object in the sky thru our telescope that had pulsating colors of red, green, blue and yellow. There was a flashing light in the sky and hardly moving. My fiance took a video of it, but looks so small on the camera.  We took out our telescope and was able to see it.  It was shaped like a sphere divided onto 4 quadrants by a black line with a black center.  The quadrants were pulsating lights. The colors were red, green, blue and yellow,  It looked like a christmas decoration.  The two of us couldn't believe what we were seeing.  We woke up our tenants and asked them to come out and look in the telescope.  They saw exactly what we saw.  It was moving very slowly.  We had to keep adjusting the telescope.  We all watched it for about an hour. There were also some smaller red lights moving around it after about 45 minutes of watching it. I did call our local police department to ask if anyone reported this sighting.  The police dispatcher said no. The night was clear and we did see many stars.  There was also a ban on planes flying due to hurricane Irene. We are all adults over the age of 23. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD));40.4306070422535;-74.4020577464789
