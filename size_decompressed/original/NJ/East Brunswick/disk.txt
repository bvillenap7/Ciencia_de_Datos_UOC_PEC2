Witnessed a saucer land in sand pits between East Brunswick and South River NJ.;1972-07-15 00:00:00;unknown;Witnessed a saucer land in sand pits between East Brunswick and South River NJ. When I was a little boy( I couldn't have been more than 4 or 5 yrs old) I was playing in the sandpits by our house.  There was a big pit surrounded By hills and we used to slide down the hills on cardboard during the summer.  I was doin gjust tha twith a little girl ( to this day I can not remember who she was)  all I remember about her is that she had long dark hair.( none of my friends at the time match that description.)  I remember cli\mbing to the top of the hill and once at the top I saw a large silver disk sitting in the pit.( yes the typical flying saucer)  It was a dull silvery color and was sitting on three 'legs'.  I remember going closer to see it better.  I heard a kind of pop and one section of the disk began to lower to the ground.  The next thing I remember running across a field on the other side of the hill towards my house. And it was getting dark so I think several hours had elapsed.  Since then I have had several other unusual experiences.  I have seen a 'creature' in my bedroom window and when I tried to screm no sound came out.  I have a small lump on my right shoulder that has been there for as long as I can remember.  I have seen several mysterious objects in the sky.  I have another episode of 'missing time'.  I have been unuassauly interested in UFOs, space, etc... all my life.;40.4306070422535;-74.4020577464789

I looked out my room window towards the New Jersey Turnpike and saw a flying saucer above the Turnpike probably less than a mile north of the hotel.  It was hovering over the Turnpike, then suddenly zoomed over the hotel. I don't know where it went after that.   A few seconds later, my cousin who was staying a few rooms down the hall that also faced the Turnpike knocked on the door.  She said she saw the flying saucer zoom over the hotel.
