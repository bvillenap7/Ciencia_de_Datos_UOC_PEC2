Bright Blue Ball flying extremely fast over the night skies of Central New Jersey;2008-06-26 23:24:00;About 3 seconds;Bright Blue Ball flying extremely fast over the night skies of Central New Jersey On Thursday, June the 26th, at around 11:24 at night, a number of friends and myself were outside of my townhouse in Central New Jersey when, during a lull in the conversation, a blue ball of light caught my eye.  As I looked up, I realized the ball was moving at an incredible speed in the direction of about 30 degrees northeast.  The light either simply disappeared after about two seconds or vanished under cloud cover.  The light must have been going at least one and a half times the speed of the fastest plane I have witnessed in flight, if not more.   It was late at night, with little stars, so the sky was almost pitch black.  As I looked around more, I could see commercial aircraft flying as they should.  My friend to my left claimed that he has seen a relatively similar object in California about two years back. My home is relatively close to the McGuire Air Force base and Fort Dix (almost exactly 30 miles Northeast).  I have never reacted this way to any event in my lifetime, and thoroughly believe that I am not the only one that had witnessed this.;40.4306070422535;-74.4020577464789
meteor shower turns into a u.f.o sighting;2009-08-12 01:00:00;hour;meteor shower turns into a u.f.o sighting My friend and I decided to watch the perseid meteor shower.  We went to a large open field by where i lived.  Meanwhile my others friends decided to watch the meteor shower also but at a different location then us. Im staring up at the sky looking for meteors and what i thought was just three stars bright in the sky, turned out differently.  I see the lower star moving from left to right and back again.  At first i thought it was my eyes but at that exact moment my friends at a different location called and asked me if we saw the moving star too.  So i started to look more closely and it started moving in a circle and then it looked like a bouncy ball bouncing onto steps the way it moved in the sky.  And then to confirm that it definitely wasn't a meteor or star, it's lights would turn off and then turn back on.  All three of these lights were moving and turning their lights on and off.  Never seen anything like it before in my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.4306070422535;-74.4020577464789
Orange Glowing ball of light hovering over the town.;2013-12-23 20:30:00;1 minute;Orange Glowing ball of light hovering over the town While driving up Rt. 18 N from Rt. 9, we observed a bright orange / yellow light hovering on the same spot over East Brunswick.  The object caught my attention as it did not move for over 30 seconds.  My wife and son also saw the light.  My son said that it was not a plane or a planet as it was too bright and had no blinking lights.  After another 30 seconds, it slowly started moving away from us and in 1 second shot across the sky and disappeared as we were watching. we have been to air shows @ McGuire Air Force Base and nothing man-made could possibly fly off at that speed.
