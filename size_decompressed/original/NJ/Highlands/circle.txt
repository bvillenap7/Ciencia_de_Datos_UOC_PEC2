Looking South from Sandy Hook New Jersey over the Atlantic Ocean I witnessed two red balls of light jumping up in down. I was star gazing with my binoculars. The Red balls of light weren't airplanes, comets, or satelights, but something strange I've never seen before in the sky. The balls of light disappeared after about 10 minutes. I also witnessed over the northern sky a floating craft that didn't appear to be a airplane, fighter jet(what I was looking for), or anything else man made. Viewed several satelites in the past, and this other object was not a satelite. white lights/ disc shape.;40.4067;-73.9878
