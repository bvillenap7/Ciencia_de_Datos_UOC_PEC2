bright white cigar shaped object/bright white light over Atlantic Ocean/Sandy Hook Beach;2006-07-14 19:30:00;1/2 hr;bright white cigar shaped object/bright white light over Atlantic Ocean/Sandy Hook Beach While at Sandy Hook Beach (Beach D) a long bright cigar shaped object could be seen.  It almost looked like the long side of an airplane when the sun shines on it but it wasn't.  It was over the ocean.  There were planes coming in and even flying below this object but the object was stationary for about 20 minutes when it was first noticed.  At one point it seemed like it was flying in the same direction, parallel to the plane but then it stopped.  It just stayed in place.  Afterwards it started to move south.  Still it was not moving as fast as the airplanes passing (en route to Newark or La Guardia).  It was also much higher than the airplanes because it only looked like a bright white line.  After a few minutes moving south it stopped again.  Then it became the shape of a ball.  A bright white ball and then started moving Northwest towards the beach.  Then when it was over land it looked like it had a long straight gray extension which didn't shine bright like the bright white ball shaped light it was attached to.  Maybe it was a satellite.  I don't know, but it was odd.  Also from the angle I was seeing this, it didn't look like it was at the same altitude as the airplanes because it was higher, looked smaller, and the planes sometimes passed below it.  This object didn't make any noise.  You could hear the planes approaching and if you didn't hear them, you could see the white trails behind.  The way this object followed, hovered,changed direction and made no noise just seemed odd. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
