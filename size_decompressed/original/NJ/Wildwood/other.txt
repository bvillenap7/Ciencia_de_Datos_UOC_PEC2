Only slight movements back and forth not indicative of any man made flight craft I've ever seen.   Multi-colored lights flashed in sequence red, blue, and green. The lights were bright and definitive in their color.   The object remained in the same section if the nighttime sky for just over 1/2 hour.  It was easily visible.  It was well above any if the lit rides that are stationed on the boardwalk.  As I got home and attempted to capture the object on video from my balcony, it disappeared.  It was difficult to ascertain the shape of the craft but it did seem to be circular or sphere shaped.;38.995;-74.8374
