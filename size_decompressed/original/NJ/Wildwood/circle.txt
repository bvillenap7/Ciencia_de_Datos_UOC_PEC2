Two very bright orange-yellow balls approximately 30,000 ft were heading east approaching the coast line of Wildwood.  As they reached the coast line, one of the objects dimmed to a very dull, barely visible light, it slowed down significantly, and proceeded to turn to the northeast.  The second object slowed approximately 20 seconds later, and also dimmed and turned northeast.  Both objects began a slow but steady acceleration.  They both continued to travel at an increasingly faster speed along the coastline.  By the time they were out of sight, they were travelling about 2 times the speed of a conventional plane at that altitude.
