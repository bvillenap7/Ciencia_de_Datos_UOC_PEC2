2 fireballs, interacting with one another, changing intensities for about a 15 -20 minute duration.;2011-07-30 22:30:00;15 minutes;2 fireballs, interacting with one another, changing intensities for about a 15 -20 minute duration. I was first to see the crafts. Started as one fireball, then another one joined it.  I stood and watched for a few minutes before getting 2 co-workers.  The fireballs come from the north and were moving south. I was near the beach, they appear to be over the bay, west from me.  They appeared to interact with each other.  They were very slow moving, changing formation, changing intensities of color ranging from white to orange.  The primary color was orange though.  This event went on for about 15 minutes or so, we were all captivated.  Eventually they slowly faded into the distance until the disappeared. oddly enough the last fireball to show up was the first one to disappear.

An orb with the colors of fire hovering high above the ocean, spotted from the boardwalk.;2012-06-27 23:00:00;Night;An orb with the colors of fire hovering high above the ocean, spotted from the boardwalk. The object was an orb with a glow of the same colors of fire.  It was first spotted from the northern end of the boardwalk when i was exiting Surfside pier.  The object was hovering high above the ocean but from my perspective from the boardwalk, it looked as high as the ferris wheel. The object didn't seem to move.  I stared at the object as I was walking south on the boardwalk towards Mariners Landing pier.  When I entered mariners landing pier, if you put a square around the ferris wheel, the object was at the top right corner.   I went on a ride and when I got off the, the object was gone.;38.995;-74.8374

3 UFOs at Firework show appearing as stars moving;2017-09-15 22:00:00;30-60 seconds;3 UFOs at Firework show appearing as stars moving @ the beach, so i didnt have a phone or camera, so unfortunately no photo or video, but I am hoping the drones that I saw there may have captured it.  On 9/15/17 Almost immediately as the 10pm fireworks at moreys pier began is when we first noticed this light. We were standing in the center of the dry beach facing the pier, boardwalk to the left, the first light orstar(looked just like Sirius in the sky,same size and brightnesss and seemingly IN the sky) appeared directly above the top of the fireworks, then began making fast radical manuevers, up, down, left, right, shooting forward then coming to a dead stop and hovering for 10-15secs, then abruptly flew towards inland and as it began to move, two more stars appeared ahead of it, the second set of stars tumbling around and bouncing off of and merging with each other, making the same speedy moves in the same direction, the two tumbling stars just out ahead of the first star for another 10-15secs, until they just blinked out. *note that there were also drones flying at that moment behind us (big red and green flashing lights hovering obviously much Much lower in altitude) as well as the helicopters that flew by moments later, NEITHER moved as fast or maneuvered they way this Star did*;38.995;-74.8374
