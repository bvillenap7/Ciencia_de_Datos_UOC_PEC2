I was faceing the bay looking @ the big dipper stars when I saw a light shoot by like a shooting star ,as I yelled to my family look at that it was already past and heading straight as an arrow . we all agreed that it was no star and any aircraft I ever saw would never make that speed .exact time unknown .. but it's speed was incredible with no sound what so ever . there was a commercial flight that it went by .  I'V been to air shows and have witnessed fast planes this was no plane ! if it was a plane it's a rocket with no orange tail !!;38.995;-74.8374
