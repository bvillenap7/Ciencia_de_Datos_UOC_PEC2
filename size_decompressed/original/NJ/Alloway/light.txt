Walked back up to my room, inadvertently looked outside and saw a bright white light stationary in the sky from a distance.  I opened the blind and began to stare at the light.  Then i opened the window to make sure it was not a glare on the window itself.  As i stared at the bright white light through the screen the light remained stationary and then suddenly  the light became more and more dim into the distance until the light source was completely gone.;39.5622;-75.3483
