Some friends and I were sitting on a trampoline and we were looking towards the church across the street from the house.  I noticed that at the top of a nearby tree there was a blinking light. As I studied it closer I saw red, blue, white, green, and orange lights flickering very quickly. It reminded me of a sign you would see in a store to grab peoples attention.  I showed my friends to confirm what I saw and they started finding more of these objects.  There was the main one (we called it the big one) above the tree, then, we started spotting one over lower trees to the right (we called it the right one). Then, one popped up in-between those two (we called it the middle one), and eventually one showed up underneath the big one. Now, my friends claimed to see very small ones surrounding them sometimes diving, flying around or “attacking” the main ones.  A few times we saw what looked like large bright shooting stars shoot down from them but it didn’t shoot acro! ss the sky, it quickly fell, seeming as if it may have fell to the ground.  We also saw beams of light across the sky often appearing to be blue. There was also this area that we called “the group” because it looked like a cluster of dim, glowing lights. I am sure these could not have been planes because we watched for hours and the objects were still in the sky around 6 o’clock am.  Planes go over our area frequently and the lights and slow speed were just a few things to prove they weren’t. It was truly one of the most intriguing, weird, and exciting things I’ve ever seen.  Also, I forgot to mention that the lights seemed to arrange in trianles at times;39.5622;-75.3483
