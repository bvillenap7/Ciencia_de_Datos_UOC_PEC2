Witness was walking down the road by wooded area, large white light in wooded area. Light was moving, can't say if it was a spot-beam of light or weather the thing was on the ground. In Short As I walked towards the area, light disappeared. Looked up with cell phone in hand and snapped 3 shots, one of which the camera caught. Ok so here goes, A 10 minute walk turns out to be roughly 2 hrs. Was hesitant in posting this back in 2009, but due to unexplained thing going on since, such as my back yard being lit up at 3:30 in the morning as to what i had saw back in 2009. Electrical Appliances not working or starting up by themselves, &quot Blender &quot going off at 2am at a very high rate of speed, much faster then normal.;40.9561;-73.9625
