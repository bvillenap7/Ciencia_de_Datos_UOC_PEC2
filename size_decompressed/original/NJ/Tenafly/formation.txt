Looked like stars one after the other for a good 15min.  They were moving East - North-East.  The last light appeared by itself and was going South and disappeared in a flash after approx 30sec - was moving slow and disappeared like a meteor;40.918;-73.9619
12 starlights were moving in formation from SW-NE direction.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-03-01 05:40:00;2 minutes;Went out at 5:40am. 12 starlights were moving in formation from SW-NE direction.The first 2 were next to each other, the other 10 followed one after the other. 2 fingers length from each other.  Then they turned very slightly in straight North direction. 1 light came from N-S direction. Now - on feb 8th i reported a formation of 40 or so starlights. These flew one after the other at approx 5 fingers distance from each other. Read that these could have been satellites from the space X launch back in 11/2019. The time was the same 5:40am-5:55am. If that is the case - iâ€™m surprised that they would come closer as time went by as opposed to further away from each other. Besides - should satellites change direction?;40.918;-73.9619
