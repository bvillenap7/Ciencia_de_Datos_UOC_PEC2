While sitting outside around the fire, I was facing the eastern sky when I saw a bright, white fast moving object come straight down from the sky below the trees.  It was not a smooth decend, but more like bumps, but very, very fast.  I yelled about it when I saw it, but no one else did, and while others start to observe the eastern sky, suddenly the light came back up in a straight ascend into the ten o'clock position, and it looked green this time to me, but white to the others. Again it was bumping, very, very quickly. It was about 1-2 minutes between sightings.;39.7289;-75.133
