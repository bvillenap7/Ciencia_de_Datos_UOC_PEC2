star-like light that bobbled side to side and up and down  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus.  PD));2004-10-11 04:15:00;2 hours;star-like light that bobbled side to side and up and down My wife and I observed a light that looked like a star in the southern sky which was as bright as Venus, but it bobbled up and down and side to side.  By the behavior of the object it didn't seem like a star or planet and definitely not a plane.  It also was too high and had no lights that would indicate that it was a helicopter.  It migrated across the sky slowly, like a star, but much quicker than any celestial object would move.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus.  PD));39.7289;-75.133
