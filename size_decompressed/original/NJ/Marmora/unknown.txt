Bright Orange Light In Sky.;1999-04-09 23:45:00;5 seconds;Bright Orange Light In Sky. I was laying in bed, and glanced over towards the door and saw a bright orange light through the door window.  As I glanced over toward the door, the light moved upward and disappeared.  It wasn't luminescent it was like an orange light directly in front of the door.  The door is between two large windows, no light was seen through them, it was only through the door window.;39.2613;-74.663
