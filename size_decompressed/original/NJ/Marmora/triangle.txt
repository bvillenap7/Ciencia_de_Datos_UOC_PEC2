Three V shaped objects with lights flying over treetops on Route 9 in Marmora, NJ.;2013-08-28 20:00:00;1 minute;Three V shaped objects with lights flying over treetops on Route 9 in Marmora, NJ. On Route 9 a mile or two from the entrance for the North Parkway to Somerâ€™s Point, we saw three lights with the last two lights dimming their lights.   The first set of lights was bright in a V shape.  They traveled slowly and there was no sound.  The last two V shaped objects were lit, but then suddenly dimmed their lights.  There was a little bit of flickering of the lights, but you could see their shadow following behind the main V shaped object.  They started off in a sandwiched formation, and then slowly separated into a line formation.  The car in front of me even stopped to watch them fly slowly over the treetops.   It was drizzling rain at the time.;39.2613;-74.663
