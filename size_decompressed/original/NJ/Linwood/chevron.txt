Last night, I was visiting my cousin and her husband.  We were outside enjoying the evening in their yard and having a conversation.  I was looking up at the sky in the direction of Orion's Belt (SW).  Directly in my field of vision, from behind me, the crafts passed overhead.  There were two large, v-shaped craft which had multiple, uniform dim white lights.  They were moving quite swiftly and made zero noise.   My mind attempted to dismiss it as a flock of white geese or an airplane, but clearly it was neither.  I have never seen anything like it before.;39.3452;-74.5804
