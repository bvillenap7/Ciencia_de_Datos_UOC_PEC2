VERY bright apparent meteor over Southern New Jersey on 10/31 and 11/1 2005;2005-10-31 18:30:00;5 seconds;VERY bright apparent meteor over Southern New Jersey on 10/31 and 11/1 2005 I and my family (3 other adults and 2 children) witnessed a VERY bright, slower than usual and apparently low altitude meteor on Halloween night around 6:30.   It moved from East to West (seemed exact) and was by far the most notable meteor I have ever seen.   I assume it was a meteor, and after some brief research found more than 60 other witnesses from the MD/VA area on a D.C. area tv station's web site:  http://www.nbc4.com/news/5220916/detail.html   Also, last night (11/1) around 10:00 p.m. in Egg Harbor Township, NJ my wife and I witnessed a rather bright blue flash, but did not see thesource of the light.  I have searched for information about meteor showers and have found little information;39.3452;-74.5804
Red orange blue yellow balls of flicking  light that were stationary side by side.;2012-08-07 01:00:00;2 minutes;Red orange blue yellow balls of flicking  light that were stationary side by side. Me and my buddy were sitting out front of my house on the porch having a cigarette and he looked up and asked me if we had radio towers here and i looked up and said, No, and jumped up out of my seat to go grab my camcorder.  My friend was trying to record on his phone and could not get it function in time.  As i was coming out of my front door the objects were fading out into space.  The objects were red orange blue yellow and  balls of light.  They looked like stars how they flicker in the sky.  But ten times bigger.  They were about 85 degrees from the ground up to the sky stationary.   They were about an arms length apart in the sky.   We both looked at each other in shock.  Because we have never witness an amazing site in our life.;39.3452;-74.5804
