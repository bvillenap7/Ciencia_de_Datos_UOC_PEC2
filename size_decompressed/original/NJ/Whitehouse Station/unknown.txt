By the time;1990-07-01 01:00:00;2 minutes;Slept at my friends house for the night when his brother and mother burst into our room to show us strange lights outside.  By the time the door opened, the entire 2nd floor of the house was illuminated with multiple colored lights from an outside source as if a craft was hovering just above us.  There was no sound at all except for many neighborhood dogs barking like crazy.  The lights moved passes the home slowly and were eventually gone....Minutes later there was a smell in air as if something was being electrified (only way to describe it)...Then about 5 minutes later we heard a low-pitched, bass sound, as if a guitar amplifier was pulsing.  Then nothing was heard or seen that night.  I have living in Whitehouse my entire life and remember this event vividly.  Plus, from what I have heard, this same part of town had similar events in the 1950's where an entire wedding congregation seen similar events in daylight with actual photos in the newspaper.
