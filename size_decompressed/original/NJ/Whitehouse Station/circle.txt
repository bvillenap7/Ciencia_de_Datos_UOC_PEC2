Bright round yellow UFO spotted on 3 different occasions;2003-12-04 05:00:00;a few seconds;Bright round yellow UFO spotted on 3 different occasions This is actually the third time I've seen this UFO. I've seen it twice before in the past couple months.  It was a bright, glowing, yellow, rounded shape (either circular or a sphere) travelling very quickly.  It was very large, way too big to be a plane.  If it weren't moving, you'd think it was the moon at first.  The first two times I saw it, I was outside and it just appeared in the sky then quickly zoomed away out of sight.  The third time, I was inside looking out the window and saw it flying a little slower.  Also in this last sighting, the sky seemed to flash about 20 minutes later as though there was lightning (which there wasn't) but I could no longer see the UFO from my window. I don't know if the flash had anything to do with it or if it was the result of something else.  In all cases, it was always travelling a lot faster than any planes would.  The first time it happened, it was around 2am, the second time I think it was 11pm, and this last time it was 5am.;40.6183;-74.772
