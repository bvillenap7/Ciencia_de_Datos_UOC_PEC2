I woke up in a panic and sweat as though I lost 4 hours.  I felt I had just fallen asleep around midnight but was shocked when I realized it was 4am.  I had strong feeling I was supposed to look around the house and out windows.  I walked about 4 feet to my right and looked out large Anderson window to see a very large white orb somewhat transparent but not able to see more in center where it was all more of a solid white yet not having any physical material...throughout entire white orb.  This large white ball was just above a nearby treeline about 20 feet away from where I was standing near window.  I stood there afraid to take pictures but called my boyfriend at time to tell him what was going on as I looked at this large glowing orb.  After hanging up, I still stood there watching for an hour.  Over the hour, it slowly crept away as tho! ugh it did not want to scare me.  It moved so slowly yet by 5 am, it looked like it was a star in the sky.  I have seen a ufo as a child but it had multiple lights and it was a disc that flew away as soon as it came (hovered over a church while we drove in car).  The first instance I had with a ufo was when I was an infant.  My mother said a ufo flew almost on top of the car we were in & she thought the car had almost died as the ufo was almost upon the car.  As soon as the ufo flew away, the car did not stall.  We had been in Whitehouse Station at the time on back roads in the evening.;40.6183;-74.772
