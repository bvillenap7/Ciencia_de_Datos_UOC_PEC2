The road was a wooded one in a hilly area.  I noticed a glow in the woods to the right and just as I noticed it a firey orange-ish ball about two feet in diameter came winding down through the contour of the valley. It was traveling at about forty miles per hour and passed over the road about 150 yards ahead of me and then continued through the woods and disappeared.  It was bright enough to illuminate the entire area as it passed through.;40.7787;-74.6003
