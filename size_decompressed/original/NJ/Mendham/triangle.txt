9 UFO's seen over a hill in Mendham, NJ.;2007-12-25 00:00:00;40 minutes;9 UFO's seen over a hill in Mendham, NJ. It was Christmas night in Mendham, NJ and something happened that totally freaked my dad and I out. We were walking on Roxiticus Golf Course and we were on the highest hill on the golf course. The hill was about 100 ft higher in elevation than most other parts of the golf course. We decided to sit down and catch our breaths. While half way down the hill, I looked above a partially developed hill called Brookrace and saw three whitish-red lights that were over the hill. It appeared to be a bent radio tower because they were not directly above and below each other, but in a curve shape above Brookrace. I said to my dad, “What’s that”? He said, “I don’t know, there’s no radio tower or anything up there, right”? After two minutes of observing them, the one that was placed in the middle, vertically, started to move to the right and closer to the hill. It now appeared to be about 300 ft above the top of the hill. The hill in which Brookrace is on is about 450 ft above the surrounding land. The other two lights started to drift to the right in up, down, circular, and diagonal motions. It appeared to us tat they could move in any direction that they wished and also come to a complete stop at any time. One minute later, the UFO that is more to the right and about 300 ft above the hill, corkscrewed down in a spiraling motion to about 150 ft above the top of the hill. About 20 seconds later the highest UFO dimmed its light and started moving left of the other two UFO’s. Again it was moving in odd, non-pattern like motions. Very soon after the same UFO appeared to turn on lights that went horizontally down the side of the craft. The colors of the lights were green, white and, red. The craft was about ½ of a mile away from us in the air. We could clearly see the description of it. It looked like we were seeing the side of a triangular prism. At no time did they change shape. Soon after the first craft moved away form the others, the most left UFO out of the two that were still above Brookrace started! to foll ow the other, it appeared to follow the same or a similar flight path. The third UFO stayed in the same area that we first saw it in but was doing amazingly odd movements such as zooming up and down. The top of Brookrace, as a crow flies, is about ¼ of a mile away from our position. We would have gone home to get a video camera if we knew how long they would be there, except our house was about ½ of a mile away. While the one UFO was still over Brookrace, the other two UFO’s were now directly behind us (if the starting position is directly in front of us.) The two behind us seemed to be about ½ of a mile higher in the sky than when they started. Than, about 8 minutes after first discovering them, another UFO started slowly coming over the hill in which Brookrace is situated on. This one as well as the other UFO that was there from the start headed towards the other two UFO’s behind us. They also put their side lights on and as well as all of the other UFO’s dimmed their lights before going into major (fly mode). For the entire time that we were watching the UFO’s, about 500 geese that were on the lake below Brookrace, were making loud distress calls as if something were hurting them. Over a period of about 20 minutes 3 more UFO’s came from over the hill and followed the same flight plan. Behind us, the 7 UFO’s were forming a formation that seemed to be like a sideways “T” shape.               This is the formation that they made about ¾ of a mile up in the sky  directly behind us. The formation consisted of 7 UFO’s. This may sound odd because most UFO sightings consist of 1 UFO, but we saw what we saw. Thirty seconds later, another UFO started coming towards the formation. It looked like this UFO was coming from over the nearby town of Chester, NJ. This was flying at a reasonable rate of speed (about 40-50 mph). The other UFO’s seemed to be going about 20-30 mph considering the amount of land that was passed in a certain amount of time. Thirty seconds later, it eventually joined the formation. “Wow, this is amazing” my dad said as we walked home in disbelief. As we looked up into the sky, we saw what appeared to be a shooting star, but the beam of light kept going and going, it must have been one of the UFO’s blasting off. As we walked home we saw the most amazing part of our night. While walking we glanced over at the lake where the geese had been making distress calls. We saw a UFO hovering about 80 ft above the lake in a kind of wobbling motion. It appeared to have an internal light and a triangular shape to it. It also appeared to be about 30-35 ft long. When my dad saw this, he shined his large spotlight that we had brought with us on it (it was about 600 ft away from us, the light did nothing to help us see it) as soon as he did that we felt a large vibration through our bodies. then we left and thought about it the rest of the night.;40.7787;-74.6003
