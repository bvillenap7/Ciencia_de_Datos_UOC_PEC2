Bright orange flashing sky.;2014-12-23 05:00:00;30+ minutes;Bright orange flashing sky. Woke up from sleep and saw the sky flickering.  Like a light switch was going on and off. Sky was orange, blue, white, green.  Would get really dim then would kick back up again very bright.   Woke my fianc√© up and he too witnessed this bright light that covered the sky.  About 1/2 hour later the power went out a couple of times.   Plan on calling the electric company to see if they have a reason for the power outage.  I could understand if a electric box blew up but this lasted for way too long.   Not long after seeing the lights my dog urinated on the floor which is unusual, the last two days have been like this with her.   I was so freaked out that I didn't take a video of it, normally I would grab my phone but this was too out of the ordinary.;40.7886;-74.1633999999999
