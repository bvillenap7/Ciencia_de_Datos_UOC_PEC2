Hello,  Thanks for taking time to look at the videos.  They were seen around 7pm in Belleville, NJ.  Headed towards nyc.  There were 4 total.  2 were in a formation and they just vanished after going north east.   My family saw them and my neighbor.  They were taken on 3 different cell phones.  I have no clue what they were but they werent planes or balloons.  They were silent, changing color, moving fast and then disappeared.  I have more videos if you need.;40.7886;-74.1633999999999
