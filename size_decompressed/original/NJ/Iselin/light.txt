Bright illumination that moved over New Jersey Sky viewed from Iselin town;2009-06-13 00:40:00;10 mins;Bright illumination that moved over New Jersey Sky viewed from Iselin town It was dark in the night and I was coming from my friends place at 00:40 midnight on 06/13/2009.   We saw a cloud that was bright in color and a suddenly a very bright white colored light much about Â½ the size of the cloud came from behind the cloud and shined for sometime and again disappeared in 4 minutes.  My mother-in-law and my wife also saw this.  I could not believe my eyes and called my friend and his wife to watch what I was observing and I explained to them what I saw.   Then again in a minute or so the same thing happened and I saw a saucer like object about the size of aircraft that had blinking lights that moved toward the cloud and again the same kind of bright light came for about 4 mins and then slowly disappread.  During this time we also saw about 4 clouds, I guess that were illuminated with that bright light.  I called 911 regarding this and they asked me to report to local police. This was a dramatic event in my life.;40.5687;-74.3202
