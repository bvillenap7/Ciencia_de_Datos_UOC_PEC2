Bordentown NJ Fire Orange Sphere's;2021-01-11 21:00:00;3 minutes;Bordentown NJ Fire Orange Sphere's I have 3 videos. I was walking my dog and I watched as 5 separate golden spheres traveled along in an almost perfect line. Then came together in groups of 3 in geometric formation and one by one vanished out of sight to higher altitude. I have had 2 other daytime sightings but this was my first evening. I asked them for a a show and I wasn't disappointed.;40.1443;-74.7003
