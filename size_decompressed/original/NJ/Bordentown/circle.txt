I was a front seat passenger in my grandson's vehicle traveling on Rt. 295 Southbound in the vicinity of the Bordentown yacht club on March 8th, 2006 at or about 1:30PM. The weather was exceptionally clear, and no cloud cover whatsoever. I observed quite clearly a very shiny metallic object that was orginally noted as cigar shaped and it was suspended in the sky. The object was tilted from a one o'clock to seven o'clock position with the right corner situated at the one o'clock position. Regarding the distances i.e. height and distance to object. I can't be certain but it wasn't close to the ground At the point where I noted the object we were traveling on Rt. 295 southbound right next to the Delaware river. That being said, the object was high in the sky in a southwesterly direction. As I watched the object it moved from it's static position to the right at a rapid speed without changing it's position, i.e. pitch, yaw and then the object moved straight up into the sky at a unbelieveable speed. As it went skyward I noted the circular shape and I distinctly remember a dark spot in the middle of the circle and a dark lining around the outside of the ojbect as it sped into space. I know airplanes and was in the Navy. I've NEVER seen anything move at that speed in my life.;40.1443;-74.7003
