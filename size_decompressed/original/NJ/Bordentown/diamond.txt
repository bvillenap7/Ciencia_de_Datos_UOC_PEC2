We were discussing the flashes in the sky,  Wondering if the were wires burning or lightning.  Then out of the corner of my eye I see something that looks like a shooting star, but much lower. It almost looked like it was a few hundred feet off the ground, it was silent and I could see a body shape like a hard edged bird but it wasn't clear.  It had a single dim white light on what seemed to be on top of it.  It was moving way too fast to be a drone or plane and there were no navigational lights.  The weird part of this to me is I've seen the same thing when I was younger two different times but there were two of them side by side flying south to North direct over our house at the beach.  My cousin tried to say they were birds or shooting stars.;40.1443;-74.7003
