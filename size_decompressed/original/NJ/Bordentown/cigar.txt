Some move throughout the sky but others seem to stay stationary.  All have flashing/glowing lights that seem to flash very rapidly.  One craft flew in a large circular direction with flashing green lights.  A plane could not have flown in this pattern and it seemed to fly too slow for a plane.  It was not a helicopter because it flew extremely steady and it made no noise.  This craft was the closest to our house.  These crafts seem to be showing up over this section of the Delaware at this time of night.  Sometimes there are more crafts than others.  They do not appear to be weather balloons or drones.  I attempted to take pictures and videos but the objects appear only as white orbs on camera/video.;40.1443;-74.7003
