We lived on the water next to Absecon Bay. I was coming down my street(which was a culdisack) and as I approached my driveway looked across the bay and saw a large purple sphere at about 45 degrees. I pulled in my driveway and watched this thing for a couple of minutes then went into the house to wake up my wife. She came outside and asked what was going on, when I told her to look in the sky and tell me what she is looking at. That 's when she was shccked. As we observed this large purple object, two smaller orange objects came out from each side of it and just hovered, I wish that I had a camera, but no luck. As we watched they were gone in a flash. No sound, no trails, just disapeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.5881;-74.3645999999999
the 2 objects seem to be following one another.;2000-04-06 20:34:00;7 seconds;the 2 objects seem to be following one another. I was standing outside my home on April 6th 2000 at approx. 8:34 pm EST. i was outside with my family and neighbors, we were lookin at the sky because it was a Pink color and thought it was very odd.There were lots of stars out and the moon was very clear (clear skies).As we kept starin at the sky  we centered our attention to a area where the sky was in a pink circle with what look like pink sun rays. all of a sudden i seen 2 boomerang shaped objects flyin thru the pink rays in the sky... they had no lights on them, they were more dull looking, kind of like a dull silver.I watched the 2 objects follow eachother and zig zag around a few stars and watched them until i could not see them anymore. There were no sounds as the objects were flying across the sky.they also traveled faster then a airplane  but slower then a shooting star and they werent lite up like a shooting star would be.After i watched it  fly away i stayed out for a few more minutes  but did not see it again.;39.5881;-74.3645999999999
I and my Husband saw a strange looking round shiny Metallic object in the sky heading N, then disappeared.;2016-10-31 15:00:00;1 minute;I was outside with my Husband and saw a strange looking round shiny Metallic object in the sky heading North, then the Object just disa I was outside with my Husband and saw a strange looking round shiny Metallic object for about one Minute in the sky heading North, then the Object just disappeared.  We both saw it.   There also was a Jetliner coming in from the East.  The Jetliner was leaving a Contrail as well as all the Jets were on this day.  We live 20 miles near the Atlantic City Airport so we see Airliners often.   The shiny Metallic Object left no Contrail.;39.5881;-74.3645999999999
