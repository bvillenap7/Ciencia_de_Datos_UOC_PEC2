It was a very clear and cold morning.  I decided to look for constellations, if I could at least see a few stars in one since there is a lot of light pollution. I didn't see any constellations, just a few random stars, here and there.  Then I looked straight overhead and saw two stars close together and they looked very high up there.  I thought it was strange they were so close together. I wasn't looking at them too long when one star started to do figure 8's around the other star.  It did it a few times then it started moving to the right and away, at a speed that wasn't fast or slow.   The other star never moved at all. They looked like a flat white color.  Didn't have sparkle to them and they weren't as bright as the other stars in the sky.;40.6751;-74.291
