I recorded a video of what could potentially have been a UFO at 3:30am on November 5, 2012 in Kenilworth, NJ area. I watched it sit completely still for over 10 minutes, before going in my house and grabbing my Nikon DLSR and my 300mm lens.  I zoomed in to the the max 300mm and recorded.  It was a good distance away and blocked partially by trees and branches.   Trying to get a better view I created some shaky video, but I assure you, this object sat completely still.  After recording it for 45 seconds, it took off in a fast and &quotlooping swish&quot like motion.  (I lost the flying off in the viewfinder behind trees and house roofs, so sorry no footage of it.)   At first I thought it was a helicopter, but the complete stillness, the sounds it made and the vibrations I felt in my body, made me think it was not a helicopter at all.   I am the first one to consider logical explanations before making assumptions like this.  I have no idea what it is/was, but it was so! mething very strange in my opinion.
