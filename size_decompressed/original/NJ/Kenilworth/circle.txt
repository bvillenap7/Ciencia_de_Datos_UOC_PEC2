White light spliting into 3 over Kenilworth NJ;2011-04-30 23:00:00;aprox 1 hr;White light spliting into 3 over Kenilworth NJ At approximately 11 pm on 4/30/11 my husband witnessed a bright white with blueish/red around the edges light in the sky while outside in our yard.  It caught his attention as it did not resemble a star.   After observing the object for several minutes he witnessed the object split into 3 identical lights, one shot off to the right and quickly disappeared, the other moved beneath the the original light, hovered a bit, and slowly descended until we lost site of it behind a local church.   The main light continued to hover, this is when my husband ran inside and got me.   I went out and observed the light with him for at approx 30 minutes, taking a few pictures in the process.    After a while we tired and went to bed, the object has not returned since.;40.6751;-74.291
