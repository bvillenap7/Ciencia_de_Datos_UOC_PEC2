It was silent, very long and large in shape (could not distinquish a definate shape per say,but more long than tall) with 2 rows of at least 8 flashing white lights along the bottom of the craft and 2 flashing red lights at the top. It came from over my home flying southward at a slow but regular rate of speed, seemed to speed up for a short distance, then return to previous speed as it headed for the horizon. Just about the horizon, it made a 90 degree left turn and began heading east at a much greater rate of speed with just the 2 flashing red lights visible now. It appeared to slow or hesitate at one point, and then accelerated out of site.;40.7021;-74.4049
