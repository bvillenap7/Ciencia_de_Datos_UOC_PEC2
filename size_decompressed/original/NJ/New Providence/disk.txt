Sunrise UFO in New Jersey.;2019-09-12 07:30:00;20 seconds;Sunrise UFO in New Jersey I was just beginning work and noticed the sun breaking thru the clouds and beginning rising... I went to the window and took one picture.  I do not remember seeing anything besides the sky during taking the pic...  I also can't remember if I was standing under a light at the time...  In the area I was at I don't believe there is one directly overhead.  I'm thinking if it is a UFO it must have zoomed in very quickly and I just happened to take a Pic at the exact moment.  If u look at the edges u can see it looks beveled or like it's moving...;40.7021;-74.4049
