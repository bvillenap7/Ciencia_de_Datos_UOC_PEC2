Green Bean (oval shaped object).;2004-10-15 01:00:00;1 hour;Green Bean (oval shaped object) My apartment faced over the Hudson River.  On the night of approx 10/15 while on the phone, noticed a lime green floating object. Initially thought it was nothing but a blimp but it didn't move for about 45 min.  I start looking for my binoculars, that were usually located by my window while doing so it streaked S-SW at a speed I had never seen before.  The person on the phone thought I was lying and so did everyone else.  No drugs of any kind were taken. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
