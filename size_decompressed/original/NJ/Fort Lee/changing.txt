Another one approaches, does the same thing, while the other one left. I saw it very clearly.  It was a flashing object and it flashed just like a plane with some red lights.  However it didn't seem like a plane because there was a real plane on the other side of the sky and it was going its typical speed.  This plane however was going pretty fast and I was instantly suspicious.  All of a sudden it stops and flashes this intense bright circle light.  Like a white yellowish light and it got brighter and brighter and bigger and bigger.  I never seen a light this bright at this scale before, it was huge.   All of a sudden, another fast plane was approaching the giant light and immediately the object turned off its light and went back to flashing like a plane with red lights and left the other way.  The plane that just visited once the other plane left, this did the same thing. It stopped and flashed the bright light.  It stayed like that for 30 sec.   Ii went to grab my phone to take a picture.  When i came back it was gone.   Also, I tried to look at the bright light and focus on it with my eyes, and I believe I saw 3-4 little circles within the object making that bright light.;40.8492;-73.9735000000001
