I was staring at it thinking how odd it’s such an unusual hour to be up.  I noticed the Little Dipper above which is also odd Bc I live near Manhattan and there’s a lot of  light pollution making stars hardly visible.   Someone then came out of a building in my complex and the green light started turning red and moving, taking about five seconds to change, and then flashed very quickly, and it was completely gone.;40.8492;-73.9735000000001
Odd Moving Red Light;2019-07-28 22:00:00;1 minute;Odd Moving Red Light I was looking at the NYC skyline and saw a red light sitting in the sky.  It was a solid red light with a smaller blinking white or blue light.  I thought it was a plane until I noticed it wasn’t moving.  It sat still for awhile, then it moved to the right and then reversed to the left.  It came to a stop and the lights turned off (it disappeared). It moved like a drone but I couldn’t tell how far away it was and the lights were very visible.  It seemed to be over the Hudson River.   Does anyone know if a drone has red lights that do not blink?  Not sure what I just saw.;40.8492;-73.9735000000001
Huge bright light appears and moves like it’s inspecting the earth below.;2020-04-06 21:45:00;48;Huge bright light appears and moves like it’s inspecting the earth below. This event has been happening for the last 8 months randomly at the same spot at the sky a bright light appears 5 times bigger than northern star.  And for about 40 mins and sometimes 2 hrs makes turns and moves that are very fast but not very far from original spot.  It is too far out to be a plane and too bright out to be a satellite and it moves.;40.8492;-73.9735000000001
