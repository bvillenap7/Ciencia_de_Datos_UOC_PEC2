I heard a constant whooshing sound that sounded to get closer and closer. Not until it sounded really close, is when I saw behind the clouds, 3 triangle shaped lights, close together, slowly move above me, stop for about 5 seconds, then rapidly flew away. They were not drones. I have and know what they look and  sound like. Fast forward, to April 16, I came across the below article citing almost exactly the same thing I saw.  https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/04/15/politics/unidentified-aerial-phenomena-defense-department/index.html;40.8038;-74.2091
