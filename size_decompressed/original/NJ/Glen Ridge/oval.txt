Transparent, glowing sphere soon followed by glowing oval.;2001-01-05 00:10:00;less than one minute;Transparent, glowing sphere soon followed by glowing oval. Was watching TV while lying on the sofa and happened to look out the window by the landing on the stairs.  I first saw a transparent, glowing sphere steadily glide across the sky and tree tops.  It was soon after that when an oval-shaped light glided steadily by, but had an aura and trail of very small flickering lights a sparkle effect. Would like to know if there were other sightings at this time. ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to confirm the date.  We are uncertain as to what 24:10 means.  We assume she means 0010 hrs., but that raises the question of whether the date is correct, we feel.  PD));40.8038;-74.2091
