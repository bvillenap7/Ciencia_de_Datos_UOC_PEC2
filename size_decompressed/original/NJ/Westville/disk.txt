Eye-shaped white light above Westville/Deptford NJ area;2005-11-11 23:05:00;about 3 seconds;Eye-shaped white light above Westville/Deptford NJ area I was driving just after 11pm, when I came to a stop at an intersection.   There was a line of cars coming, so while I was waiting a bright light caught my attention.  It was pretty high in the sky, much too high to be a street lamp.  The light was purely white, and shaped like a human eye, or a saucer type shape.  The light did not move at all, and I stared at it for at least 3 seconds, before it disappeared.  It didn't just vanish though, it appeared as if the two lids of the eye it shaped came together, as if someone blinking, and when they touched the light disappeared entirely.  I stared at the spot for long afterwards and it didn't reapper.;39.8662;-75.1259
