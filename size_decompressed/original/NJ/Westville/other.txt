Hard to make out with the lights and my fe I was smoking outside. In an apartment complex. I walked to the end and was staring at the moon. It was beautiful. I noticed a bunch of airplanes outside. It looked to be so high up. But it wasn't. Because one came down, right above my head at the treeline. It was aware, and it looked as if it noticed me and came down.  It had an orange light and white lights, combined. It was well hidden, because when it went back up, after I ran for my life. I showed my neighbors, who said it was an airplane. I said no it came down to my face. It was a circle type of object, but hard to see with the bright lights.  After I collected myself and went back outside. There were 2 of them. Hanging out here for about an hour.  It came down to me again, a couple of times. I was terrified. And I wish I wasn't.  But the ending was when it got very strange. When they left, for good.  I had a couple neighbors outside. And it came at me one last time. But this time, it was the shape of! a real airplane. And this time it made sound. But it was the same exact object that flew down towards me a couple of times during the night. And the airplane was so low. Right over my complex. That didn't make sense either.   During the hour I also saw a helicopter. Flying by, above it. But now I question if that was truly a real helicopter because of the ending. I would like to be able to find out if there was any traffic above my complex. I took a couple pictures of it. But, again, it really doesn't do any good, because it looks like a craft in the air. The only reason I knew it wasn't was because it flew all the way down to me. 10 feet ide say above me. It wasn't big, at all.;39.8662;-75.1259
