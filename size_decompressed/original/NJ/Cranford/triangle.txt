Small blinking lights moving fast in  the distance.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD));2008-08-07 00:30:00;1 hour;Small blinking lights moving fast in  the distance. I was just about to go to bed when a friend called me and told me to look outside. I thought to myself what can be that important for my friend to call me this late. I looked out side and saw small blinking dots in the far distance moving far too fast for planes. Then twice every minute a large triangular object would fly over my house, It had two very large white lights in the front and was blinking all kind of lights at the bottom. At first I thought it was a plane but then i realized that planes never go over my house. Then I woke up the next day and looked out my window to see if it was a plane that kept on flying over the house and there was not one plane the entire day. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??
