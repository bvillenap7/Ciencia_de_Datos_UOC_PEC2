Large, silent V-shaped craft spotted traveling southeast quickly in a linear path.;2013-11-29 23:30:00;7 seconds;Large, silent V-shaped craft spotted traveling southeast quickly in a linear path. Yesterday around 11:30 to 11:33pm Eastern time, I was taking my dog out in my backyard and looking at the sky since it was unusually clear.  While looking at some stars I noticed slightly dimmer lights (yellowish-white) in a V-shaped formation moving across the sky.  I quickly reached for my iPhone in my pocket, looked down to pull up the camera, but by the time I was ready to take a picture, the object was passing over some trees. I did not have the time to count the amount of lights but I would approximate there were about a little over a dozen.  They were about the size of the stars-that is, they were tiny lights, not large.  These yellowish-white lights did not flicker or blink and were very close together, about six or seven forming each arm of the V-shape.  Since the sky was very clear and dark, I could not make out an actual shape of the aircraft aside from the shape the lights made.  The V-shape was neither too wide nor too narrow.  It was shaped like a normal V. The aircraft was silent, but massive.  If you stretch out your arm and separate your thumb and pointer fingers by about 2.5 to 3 inches, you will get a pretty good idea of how large it was. It moved very quickly across the sky in a linear path, meaning it wasn't zigzagging around.  I pulled up the compass on my phone to see exactly what direction it was heading in-it was heading around 150 degrees southeast, and coming from the north or northwest direction.  One final note: my dog acted normal as if nothing had happened.;40.6575;-74.3094000000001
