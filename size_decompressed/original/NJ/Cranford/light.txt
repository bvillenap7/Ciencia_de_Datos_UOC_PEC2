Me and some buddies were hanging out in our parking lot when 2 of us saw the same green light, very bright, fly by really quickly and disappear beyond the treeline, never saw it land.  We of course started yelling out of fear, we knew it had to land very far away, about 10 minutes later we saw a second, same speed, same green light, the crazy part that made us know this was no ordinary thing was that they wrere so low, and about 5-10 minutes later, government planes (so i think) started flying very low in the same direction of the ufos, not a normal amount of planes, maybe about 15-20, very very low and all in the same places.  Of course we all had to be home but that is what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Red Orb Seen Being Chased By Military Aircraft Over Cranford NJ;2020-08-08 22:28:00;<2 minutes;Red Orb Seen Being Chased By Military Aircraft Over Cranford NJ About 10:30pm last night, 8/8/2020, I was outside walking my dog when a light caught my attention, it was a bright red/orange solid orb in the sky, it went left extremely quick from the position it was in and then right to the same original location, it then came towards my location at en extreme rate of speed. I then noticed that 2 V-22 Osprey were following it, I've seen them multiple times since Bedminster Golf Club is just a few miles from here, in the video you can see the ospreys lights blinking showing the navigation lights while the orb I saw never blinked and when it passed me went straight up into the air extremely fast and was gone. Before it disappeared, a fighter jet of some kind went flying over extremely fast and loud as well seeming to be chasing whatever was in the sky.;40.6575;-74.3094000000001
