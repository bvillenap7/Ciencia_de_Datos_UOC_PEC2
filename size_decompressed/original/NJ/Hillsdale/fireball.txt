Orange fireballs in triangular formation in evening sky over Northern Bergen County on June 15, 2012;2012-06-15 21:30:00;7 minutes;Orange fireballs in triangular formation in evening sky over Northern Bergen County on June 15, 2012 Tonight around 9:30 p.m. I was traveling south along Pascack Road from Park Ridge, NJ.  As I crossed into Hillsdale, I looked to my left (east) and noticed a large, glowing orange sphere.  I orginally took it for the moon and thought it was odd to be located in that part of the sky.  As I turned east onto Washington Avenue, I noticed another flaming ball in the sky.  I thought they both were helicopters (despite the orange glow) and opened my window to hear the rotors.  I heard nothing.  I pulled onto my street and then into my driveway.  Getting out of my car, I returned to the street and looked up.  There were now three glowing, orange balls in a triangular formation in the northern sky. I called to a guest who was going into my home. As a retired police officer, I thought he might have an idea as to what the objects were. We watched them together. The objects appeared  not to be moving and maintained this formation for 3 solid minutes as we discussed what! they could be.  We then called to the others to come out and see, as we did the intensity began to diminish from orange to white and eventually faded from view.
