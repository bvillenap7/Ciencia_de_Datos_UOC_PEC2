Long cigar shaped, all dark, fast moving object. No lights but you could see it's form bc of reflected moonlight.  ((anonymous report));2019-08-11 03:00:00;10-13 seconds;3am, long cigar shaped, all dark, fast moving object.  No lights but you could see its form bc of reflected moonlight or an aura maybe Around 3am, I saw a glimmer but not light or a star, etc..  Cigar shaped, completely dark object flew fast, north to south, directly overhead.  No sound, no lights...like a silouette or reflected moonlight bc you could see its form easily.  Could not tell height or size only it was probably large and moved at a rate as if you'd see a helicopter fly by, for example. I watched it for about 10 seconds until I couldn't follow its path due flying over Atlantic City (lots of city lights, etc). It was not a plane of any kind and much too fast for a blimp although its dimensions could be explained as such.  Not a doubt in my mind that this was a craft and would be near impossible to see if not just happening to be looking at stars in the exact location of its flight path.  Will absolutely be looking more in coming days. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.4093;-74.3704
