I don't know how high it was or how wide.  It was just sitting there in the sky.  There was no sound or anything.  After about 2 minutes it just went straight up and was gone.  As I stood there looking up because I had no idea what I saw way out it the distance i saw a small light in the sky that just took off. It was so fast that it was gone in seconds.  I know that it wasn't any aircraft that we had because there is a NJ Air National Guard base that was about 6 miles away and when they would takeoff and land the planes would fly right over my house and they were loud.  Whatever this was there were no visible wings sound or anything.  To this day I still have no idea what I saw but I know what I didn't see.;39.4093;-74.3704
Red/orange fireball.;2016-06-26 00:15:00;3 minutes;Red/Orange Fireball I was walking home from bus stop in Brigantine, about 12:15 am, and saw a moving light catch my eye that I almost immediately dismissed as a plane.  It was a big red/orange glowing ball and it went shooting to 2 stars, grew big in size and then floated and disappeared.;39.4093;-74.3704

No sound at all it hovered for a few minutes then slowly moved and disappeared  into the clouds.  It was seen at our beach house back deck above the ocean.  We have video of it but it is not that good.  We were in shock at what we were seeing.;39.4093;-74.3704
