3 orange lights over NJ bay area, with REALLY loud humming noise heard.;1998-08-01 20:00:00;5 min;3 orange lights over NJ bay area, with REALLY loud humming noise heard. 3 orange lights seen over south-bay (by old country club) that appear in the sky in a row,stay in one spot for 5 sec then fade away, only to return seconds later and repeat process. The REALLY weird thing was the SOUND it made. It was a REALLY LOUD low hum, like nothing I have ever heard. The reflection from the lights could be seen on the water, so they must have been fairly-low. My friend and I were standing about a 1/4 mile away. After standing there for a few minutes watching this, I flashed my high-beams in it's direction,and it stopped a minute later, back to complete silence and no lights. There is a large Airforce base across the bay a few miles away. Anyone else see this????;39.4093;-74.3704
Lights over Brigantine, New Jersey.;2002-02-26 20:00:00;1.5 Min;Lights over Brigantine, New Jersey. I live on the north end of the island.  From my front porch facing the oceanside of the island I observed 2 sets of double lights.  Each set ran vertically and was rotating clockwise.  At first it looked like two planes circling each other but they were too close.  The lights were on for approximately 2-3 seconds then blinked off and on again in a different part of the circle as both sets moved south.  I observed 3 flashes as they moved south.  The fourth and last set of lights there were approximately 10-12 sets of double lights.  Each set ran vertically only this last time they made a half circle that was moving clockwise.  They were closer together than the first 3.  Kind of like a double chain or a rollercoaster.  There was no sound at any time and it took less than 2 minutes.  The lights were a light yellow in color, almost white.  They made no streaks as they moved.  I could not see anything but the lights.  It was too dark.;39.4093;-74.3704
