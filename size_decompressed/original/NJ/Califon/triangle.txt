I usually see many commercial aircraft flying in this direction but this particular aircraft was much lower and much brighter.   The object also was moving much slower than typical aircraft.  The object slowly banked to the left and hovered over my neighbors house.  It had 3 bright lights on the back side and disappeared into the treeline.  Moments after I saw a military jet and a helicopter in the same area.;40.7134;-74.8151
