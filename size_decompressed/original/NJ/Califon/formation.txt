Upon walking out in the evening to bring out the garbage, we heard a helicopter off to the south east.  Looking up the valley from our home, towards Long Valley, we noticed a strange collection of lights on a craft that was hovering over the valley.  A commercial airline was in the flight path above us to the west, heading towards Newark Airport.  The lights on the hovering craft were unlike any lights we notice on the aircraft in the flight patterns around our home.   My son turns to me and says, Do yo use that? and I am staring sayings Yes, what is that? as we studied it trying to figure out exactly what we were seeing it disappeared, almost like it was vacuumed up into thin air.  We paused and completely dumbfounded, as it was unlike anything we had ever witnessed before.  We waiting a few minutes and nothing, it was completely gone from the sky that our eyes could see.;40.7134;-74.8151
