I pulled car over then reacquired lights now stationary over Woodbridge.  Now one much lower than other. Lower light then flew straight up almost touching the 2nd light & passed it.  Got on phone to call local friend about lights then once looking up again the lights had traveled south now in Driscoll bridge area spread further apart & had 2 other different lights in same general area.  The 2 other lights were possibly planes?  Lost sight due to getting low on the horizon & trees.  Got on Rte 9 South to follow but lights were gone.;40.5555;-74.2855
