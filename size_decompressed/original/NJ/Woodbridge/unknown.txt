Mystery CONTRAILS ASSOCIATED with LOUD  SKY ROAR/RUMBLE;2012-09-27 17:45:00;<30 seconds;Mystery   CONTRAILS ASSOCIATED with LOUD  SKY ROAR/RUMBLE Hi, at approx 5:45  pm on 9-27-12, I was traveling east on Parsonage RD  when I first heard a tremendous roar in the area,  I  thought it was due to the nearby Metropark  but the rumble seemed to come from the sky in front of me.... It was very loud, seemed to resonate  all thru the area and I found it very hard to pin-point...Lasted about 30 secs or so..I went a few blocks ahead and looked up in the eastern sky and saw FRESH CONTRAILS approx 50 degrees off the horizon, there were two of them and the more visable one was having the &quotEYELASHES FORM&quot from it and drop down, I looked again and the contrails seemed to arc from the south horizon out to east going along the Jersey Coast out to LONG ISLAND. It was also at an extremely high altitude  for me to see it.. The other smaller contrail hung there for a while but  faded out.The thicker contrail had the FALLING EYELASH Effect for about 15-20 mins after the tremendous roar.. IMO  this was  the AURORA  type craft coming or going from the area with an escort craft with it..it was partly cloudy y out, about 72 degrees in temp , Don't know if this would classify as a UFO sighting but the tremendous roar and wierd contrail would  make it  classification for the mystery noises all aroundnthe country...OUR AUROURA???  A UFO  going into orbit???? You decide...thanks........;40.5555;-74.2855
