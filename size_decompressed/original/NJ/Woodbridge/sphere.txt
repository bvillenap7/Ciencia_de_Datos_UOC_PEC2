Orbs flying above towards multiple flashes of light.;2015-08-15 16:00:00;Hours;Orbs flying above towards multiple flashes of light. This video was shot on August 15th, 2015, around 4 pm eastern time, in central New Jersey.   I had noticed I was able to see something if I stood where just the corona of the sun could be seen, so I decided to aim my iPhone camera at that direction.  Coming in from right and from top left are two orb like objects that change speed and path.   Today, I zoomed in for first time, having forgotten I have this video, and noticed numerous bright flashes of light in the sky in the direction where the objects seemed to be headed.  When I had noticed it, I showed it to others, all coworkers- some of which are very much skeptics of these things.  Everyone's general reaction was the same- startled and in awe.  This actually spanned a few days.  No rhyme or reason as to when it started or stopped. ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the video, and tiny white objects can be seen moving across a clear, blue sky.  However, we wonder whether the objects might be insects, brightly illuminated by sunlight.  PD));40.5555;-74.2855
Misty sphere.;2017-08-05 18:35:00;~1 minute;Misty sphere On Saturday, August 5, 2017, between 6:35 and 7:00 PM, I was in my car, facing east on Woodbridge Avenue (about three blocks before you reach Route 9) in Woodbridge, NJ, waiting for a red light.  I was looking up at the clear blue sky and saw a misty round orb to the right, about the size of a large grapefruit, held at arm's length. This orb was white, and moved through the clouds toward the west.  After a few seconds, a bright flash of light emitted from the center of the orb, and then it was gone. The whole sighting lasted about the time it took for the traffic light to change.;40.5555;-74.2855
