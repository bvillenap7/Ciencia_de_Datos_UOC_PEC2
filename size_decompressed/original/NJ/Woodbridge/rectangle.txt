2:50AM - Woodbridge, NJ - UFO Spaceship sighting - 5 windows - bright light in windows.;2009-12-01 03:00:00;5-7 minutes;2:50AM - Woodbridge, NJ - UFO Spaceship sighting - 5 windows - bright light in windows. Around 2:50AM, I looked out of the window, and saw what appeared to be a spaceship out side of my window. It was very low in the sky--maybe 50 feet above a house. It was a square shape, but not a perfect square because of its rounded edges. There were five windows – one row of three and one row of two. Through the windows, I could only see bright white light – a square full of light. It wasn’t the same as looking through a house window where you can see objects better because of the light, and night outside.  All I could see was light. The object was moving about 10 mph. Then it disappeared behind a tree to the other side of my building. I ran to another window in my apartment, and then I could see it again. I ran back into my bedroom to get my cell phone to take a picture, and ran back to the window, and it was still there--moving very slowly!  Unfortunately, just as I started to take the picture, it picked up speed and disappeared again! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
