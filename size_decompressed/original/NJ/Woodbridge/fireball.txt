8-10 flickering fireballs, in single file, from south to northeast.;2015-08-15 21:00:00;4-5 minutes;8 to 10 flickering fireballs in single file from south to north-east About 8 or 10 amber flickering fireballs in a single file almost perfectly spaced traveling from south to north-east.  They looked fairly low compared to planes in my area, about the size of a basketball in the sky and flickering like a candle.  They moved silently through the sky in one direction.

Reddish/orange fiery orb hovering, appeared to descended then disappeared out of sight.;2015-09-26 20:15:00;2 minutes;Reddish/orange fiery orb hovering, appeared to descended then disappeared out of sight. Between approximately 8-8:30 p.m. EST Saturday September 26th 2015 while outside with my two daughters roasting marshmallows my oldest daughter was sitting on her tree swing and asked me “what the heck is that in the sky Dad?”  I turned towards her and looked up and there was this fiery orb like object hovering in the sky.  It did not appear to move but at times appeared to be spinning and swaying left to right and maintained a reddish/orange color but mostly a deep red.   I ran inside to get my camera and as I came out it seemed to be descending very slowly as I ran to the front of the house it was gone.  This all lasted approximately 2-3 minutes from the time of the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.5555;-74.2855
