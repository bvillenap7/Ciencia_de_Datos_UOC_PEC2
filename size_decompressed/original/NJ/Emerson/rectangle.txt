These are blue-collar, relatively unimaginative people who had absolutely no interest in, or knowledge of, UFOs. My father was a house painter with a sixth-grade education, and mother was a secretary.  Anyway, they lived in a little town called Emerson, which is perhaps 25 miles from New York City.  On this night, around midnight or perhaps 1 a.m., they were coming home from a bingo game or similar small-town event, when they saw a large, brightly lit and low-flying rectangular object near a major thoroughfare, Kinderkamack Road.  It was so large and well defined that they first thought it was a billboard, and they remarked something like: Gee, why would the town put up a big billboard like that?  Then they noticed that it was moving slowly and silently over the town. It just moved away, over some treetops, and that was the end of the encounter. They never reported it to law enforcement, and they never heard of anyone else in town seeing this object.  My name is ((name deleted)). My email address is ((e-address deleted)).
