Silver mettalic sphere tumbling/spinning and moving at steady state speed.;2018-06-17 19:00:00;~10 seconds;Silver mettalic sphere tumbling/spinning and moving at steady state speed. Silver-metallic sphere was tumbling/spinning as it moved south to north.  I was looking out over the valley from my deck.  Then it appeared out of nowhere, tumbling/spinning as it moved south to north.  The sphere was moving at approximately 100 mph.  Distance from where I stood to the sphere from the moment I saw it was approximately 1/2 mile.  As it tumbled/spinned either it emitted a white/yellow light or it had caught the sun's rays but just for a brief moment before it traveled behind the tree line and I lost sight of it.  As to its size, the best estimate I can provide is between 20-30 feet in diameter.  I did notice that the shere had sections on it.  The sphere did not emit sound, there was no exhaust trail, moving straight and at steady speed.  Sky was clear, no haze, no cloud cover.;40.9708;-74.0368
