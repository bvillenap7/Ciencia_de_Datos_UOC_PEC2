Triangle shaped abject that hovered in the sky;2003-11-23 18:30:00;1/2 hour;Triangle shaped abject that hovered in the sky It was between 6 PM and 7PM when me and my friend were walking to the house of this girl we know.We were walkin through a park and I saw 3 lights just in the sky and I turn to my friend and went do you see that.He asked me what and I said the lights... it looks like it could be a UFO. Being the non-believe he is he's like yea whatever. I continued to look at it and it just hovered there  and I eventually lost sight of it. We got to this girls house and she wasent there so on the way back to my house I looked for it again and it was gone. I couldn't believe it and now more than ever I believe. It was just an object in the sky, 3 lights in the form of three points of a triangle.;40.5509493150688;-74.4604029109581
