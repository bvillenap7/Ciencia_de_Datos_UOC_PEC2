alledged UFO sighting unreported from over 20 years ago, if story is true it could not be a man made aircraft nor a natural phenomenon;1987-07-20 21:00:00;40-60 seconds;alledged UFO sighting unreported from over 20 years ago, if story is true it could not be a man made aircraft nor a natural phenomenon My mother and her cousin (my second aunt) during the summer of 1987 insist that they saw a a trapazoid shaped object above them while driving in an automobile heading southbound on Stelton rd. AKA county rd.[529] on there way to TOP's appliances which is at the corner of [529] and NJ state HWY 27. Now I know this has taken an incredibly long time to reported by I can remember there accounts of this very vividly. And no, this report is not intended as a joke or hoax. They say simply that they saw trapezoid shaped object with clearly distinct multicolored lights momentarily turning on and off while the object was comming from starboard (meaning from their right side facing front) and going in a generaly port direction (to their left) while making sharp right angle turns and whipping in different directions that's exactly the way they described it's movement ... They estimated it's size to be comparable to a typical 737 type passenger jet airliner and it was at a consistantly continuous altitude of several thousand feet above the ground (close to the same height as a airliner usually is in that area). They both insist that it could not be a reflection because they actually pulled to the right hand shoulder of the road and watched the thing go by. They say that no other vehicles were passing by in either direction when they were stopped. Unfortunately in addition to having no other witnesses to their account they do not have any phy! sical evidence of it either (photo's or anything else). There location where they pulled over was just in between the camp Kilmer U.S. Army reserve center and a small strip mall. All those years ago that part of Stelton road was not as developed as it is today. My mothers occupation is a homemaker and my aunt works as a real estate agent along with doing sales for a book publisher. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

Trapezoid shape craft with 5 lights hovering and no engine sound in Piscataway, NJ;1988-07-04 17:00:00;5 minutes;Trapezoid shape craft with 5 lights hovering and no engine sound in Piscataway, NJ I was walking with my husband’s cousin to the corner store to pick up some items. When we came out of the store we saw a trapezoid shaped craft with 5 lights. It was hovering right over us on the road and seemed so close. We could not hear an engine at all. I thought it was going to fall on top of us, so we started running. We were so scared and this is something we’ll never forget. I was about 33 at the time and his cousin about 17. I should have reported it at the time but it seemed so incredible. It still shakes me up to even write this encounter.;40.5509493150688;-74.4604029109581

It shined a big spot light , that's what initially got my attention which cause me to pull over on the highway. I sat and watched this unusual craft for 33 minutes until it took off with a tilt and zoomed away into the night. I called 911 , they didn't believe us. I have some clear picture and video to prove what we saw last night. I'm still in shock;40.5509493150688;-74.4604029109581
