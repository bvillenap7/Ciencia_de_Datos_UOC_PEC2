I took notice of it because I happened to be looking in that direction and it seemed to be   a strange shape to be able to fly. It had no wings, yet it moved like an airplane. It made no noise and seemed to be followed by a single engine aircraft. I was able to take two photos of the object and two photos of the aircraft. The UFO, if it was one, suddenly took off toward the NNE with a sudden increase in speed which the airplane could not match. The color of the object was dark and did not change and it never made a sound. The engine of the aircraft was barely audible.;41.0095000000001;-74.0079
