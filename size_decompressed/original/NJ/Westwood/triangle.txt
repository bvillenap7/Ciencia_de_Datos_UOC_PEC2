The color of the object seemed to closely match the surrounding sky which was dark blue.  The object did not have any navigational strobes.  However, the outline could faintly be seen because there were several dim lights around what appeared to be the edges of the object.  The Big Dipper was clearly visible nearly directly overhead.  From our perspective, the object traversed the distance between Jupiter and the Big Dipper in under 5 seconds.  No discernable sound was evident and it moved very quickly from South to North through the part of the sky that was visible to us at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness briefly, and he sounded to be quite credible, in our opinion.  PD));41.0095000000001;-74.0079
