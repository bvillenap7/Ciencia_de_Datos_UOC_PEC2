((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Ok Peter Thanks for the heads up. What I did notice in my report on the sighting that the time was incorrectly listed as 1400 hours in fact it was 0200 Eastern daylight savings time.

Yellow/Orange glowing bell-shaped object moving North to South in residential neighborhood.;2014-08-14 20:30:00;2 minutes;Yellow/Orange glowing bell-shaped object moving North to South in residential neighborhood I walked out in my backyard before an expected rainstorm.  The sky was very dark with clouds.   I was only outside for about 2 minutes when I witnessed a moving “bell-shaped” object that appeared to be translucent with a very bright orange/yellow glow inside of it, almost like fire.  It looked to be about 10 to 12 feet tall by maybe 5 to 7 feet wide.  (I thought it looked like a big jellyfish without tentacles.)   I would estimate it was only 40-50 feet off the ground when I first saw it come over the neighbor’s house, moving upward and across the sky from North to South.  There was no sound.   I screamed for my husband – he ran outside and saw it too though not as close-up as me – then we ran out front.   We watched as it went higher and higher in the sky, and we watched the bright light very high up in the sky, before it eventually disappeared.  There was not enough time to grab a camera.;40.9866625;-74.0596
