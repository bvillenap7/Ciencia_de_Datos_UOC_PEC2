Bright white, stationary light over Washington Township NJ.;2013-11-15 17:00:00;1+ hour;Bright white, stationary light over Washington Township NJ Bright white light noticed just after dusk in southern sky, to the right of the moon.  Stationery, and was observed for over an hour.  Went inside for a while, came back out and it was gone.  Definitely not a star â€“ cloud cover was very thick and no stars could be seen in the sky.  Friends in Mt. Ephraim and Tabernacle also saw it.  Grabbed binoculars to check it and no other lights were visible on the object (no red and green lights like aircrafts have).   Not a helicopter.;40.9866625;-74.0596
