Triangular UFO and bright orb UFO above farm and tree line in rural NJ;2021-06-07 22:00:00;10 minutes;Triangular UFO and bright orb UFO above farm and tree line in rural NJ I live in a remote area of Hunterdon County NJ. I was driving home on Pine Bank Road, there are two farms and a hiking trail / field of public land. Right above the tree line I saw a triangular black craft with 3 lights. I pulled over on the side of the road. It seemed like it was looking for something in the trees. I also saw a bright orb that came closer to the triangular craft underneath it. While I do read up on the UFO subject, I actually was a bit frightened so I didn't try to draw attention to myself and just drove home. Interestingly one of the farms is called Vampire Hills. I wonder if the area has a history of paranormal activity.;40.518;-74.8453
