She was pointing upward while looking stretching to look backward in her beach chair.  At this time I quickly glanced up while noticing my sister also looking and several other movie watchers looking and pointing up.  I started observing what I assumed would be planes or helicopters, 6 in total, but because it was so dark and no outline was visible, I couldnt figure out what they were.  I then started to look at the lights, figuring there would be a flashing pattern of some kind.  There was no flashing, rather a steady stream of orange light that looked foggy for lack of better words.  This was not due to the weather as it was a clear enough night where the lights were sharp as was observed simultaneously as a smaller plane, headed north east, was very sharp like an led bulb.  It was easy! to look at that plane and see what it was and gauge an elevation and direction of flight, but these other things just kind of hung there for awhile and one by one disappeared from sight.  They seemed very close as if they were hovering only a few hundred feet above the shore line alike a coastguard helicopter, but there was no sound.  Best description I could give is saucer shaped with orange lights that spanned the circumference like was similar to a burning oil lamp.  I didn't take a picture or video for a number or reasons: other people were already doing so, I was trying to figure out what they were, I was mesmerized and didn't want to look away, figured eventually I would see it was just a plane as I didn't exspect them to vanish and not into a cloud or the horizon they just blinked away.;39.9462;-74.0813
