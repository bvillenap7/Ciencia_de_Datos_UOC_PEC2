((HOAX??))  Many dancing orbs across the night sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-17 21:00:00;>4 hours;Many dancing orbs across the night sky On the evening of March 17, 2017, upon arrival home from work, I turned onto Cemetery Road from State Hwy. 206, heading toward my home, when I saw 4 bright white orbs lined up from the mountain in diagonal fashion.  Then they suddenly scattered in various directions.   After they disappeared, 2 white orbs, 2 red orbs and 2 gold orbs took their place.  The 2 gold orbs took off toward the west.  The 2 red orbs took off toward the north. The 2 white orbs remained.  The gold and the reds returned.  More white orbs spawned from the stationery white orbs.   The new white orbs seemed to bounce along the mountaintop then way up in the sky.  They seemed to travel in tandem.  At one point 10 white orbs gathered a cluster of 5 pairs above the mountaintop.  This went on for several hours with orbs breaking away from a pair or cluster and seemingly dancing across the sky.
