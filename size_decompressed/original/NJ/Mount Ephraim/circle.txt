Circular craft spotted in Mount Ephraim, NJ.;2014-01-01 22:00:00;10 minutes;Circular craft spotted in Mount Ephraim, NJ Being very dark out, my boyfriend and I were driving and saw a huge ball of light in the sky that appeared to be stationary.  As we were driving towards it I stopped where it was overhead and then it almost appeared to be falling. It then quickly started moving left. As it was overhead, you could see the bottom of the craft was a circular shape.  It had various pulsing lights on different angles of the craft.  We kept driving to follow it but it began to move away very quickly.;39.8884;-75.0936
