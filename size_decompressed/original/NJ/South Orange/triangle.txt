I noticed a light that was brighter and a bit lower through the tree line, but still high enough to be in a flight path.  My eyes went immediately to it as it was brighter than a normal plane and did not blink, but lit up solid white light and as fast as I noticed it, it disappeared.  I waited for it to appear again, but it was if someone turned on a very bright light and then shut it off immediately.  There was no noise from it.   Iâ€™m not sure what it was, but it was no plane.
