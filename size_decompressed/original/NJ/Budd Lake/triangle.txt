huge object over fileds Near Budd Lake,NJ;1988-06-15 22:00:00;1 hour;huge object over fileds Near Budd Lake,NJ Me & and a friend (whom was driving) were coming back from shooting basketball one summer evening Down a back road back to Budd lake New Jersey a road we drove regularly lots of farms and cows etc..  To avoid turnpike traffic (the road was off of Flanders Netcong Road) anyway about half way home The cigarette lighter in Eric’s car began to smoke terribly (now the weird part is that his dad unplugged it to keep him from smoking in his car ~~ I know  but it is true he is a Preachers son) Then a few seconds later the car died ~ we rolled off the road in a turn around spot I grabbed a rag and pulled the lighter works out of the car and thru it into a puddle on the side Of the road ~ it was so hot steam came off of it. And while we were looking at the lighter in the puddle Going what the hell just happened ~~ Eric grabbed me and dude look , look look ~~ I kinda paniced at first because here we are 2 West Virginia boys in the middle of no where on the side of the road at night ~ this is a movie right? So I turn and look up and bam ~ there it was just hovering over the tree line Which if anyone knows the area knows Pines between 40 to 80 feet tall ~~ medium growth ~ I look straight ahead and there is a wooden fence and a huge field with several cows kinda huddled real close together and next to the fence line. I run over to the fence and stand on the first rung and begin looking at the craft which is enormous I mean 4 football fields or more ~ so big you couldn’t see the end or the beginning or the sides ~~ it just covered the entire field!!! We just kept looking at each other going this isn’t happening!! The thing was just hovering it had several lights not flashing but not so bright as to Cast any kind of shadow or anything and it was so dark ~ there are no kinds lights out there ~ at all I mean really pitch black ~ the lights I’ll never forget they were red white and a few where kinda like glowing not really any kinda positive color just hot or heat looking if that makes sense ~~ Eric says it was triangle shape but me being the more level headed of the two in stressful situations I believe it was square but in the night sky and as big as it was who knows? All I know is that the damn thing was big and I was scared for the first time in my life ~~ I’ve gone 200mph on a motorcycle and jumped outta planes seen two of my kids be born even had a toe to toe with a real Hell’s Angel . But I’ve never seen anything like this ~ nor Have I ever spoken of this to anyone else other than Eric ~ and I don’t think he has either ~ I’M A PROFESSIONAL AT WHAT I DO NOW some years later and this is something I’ve never gotten over ~ anyway ~ the thing start to move north west by my best guess because we followed it after it moved away the car started right back up and we rode back to the RT. 206N then onto 613 then onto 667 ~~ were we lost it ~~ it crossed the main highway several times and I kept saying to ERIC man doesn’t anybody else see this freaking thing?? It was so damn big!! We weren’t drinking  anything stronger than Gatorade and were weren’t doing drugs ~ really wasn’t our thing ~ just heading home after shooting some hoops with some friends ~~ I think for me there is more to the story than what I have spoke of because of something that happened as a child to me ~ but I won’t go into that ~ just know that I’m a realist who believes in the here and now ~~ and this thing haunts me everyday!!  I'm only doing this becuase of a show I saw last night about the NYC area UFO Hunters  ~ ~ and some of the things they showed looked like this and man it was weird first time in years it really really hit me ~~ I gotta speak up ~ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
