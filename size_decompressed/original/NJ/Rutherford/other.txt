shining orbs appear near chemtrails;2005-04-17 13:00:00;10 minutes;shining orbs appear near chemtrails After the morning service at church some of us went outside to enjoy the beautiful spring weather and as I looked to the sky, it was full of chemtrails. (This happens quite often on Sundays)  Then out of the sky five shining orbs appeared through the most recent trail. I could still see the jet that laid out this trail. The orbs floated slowly in different directions around the trail. One seemed to be flickering and the others stayed bright and steady. They were not high flying hawks or eagles. I am familiar with them and they were not flying in a circular motion as raptors do when riding the rising currents.  I also thought ballons but they appeared out of nowhere and all five were the same color although two appeared to be larger than the others. Besides the chemtrails the sky was perfectly clear and blue. They dissapear back into space one by one.;40.8318;-74.121
