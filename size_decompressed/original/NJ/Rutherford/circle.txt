UFO sighting in North Jersey;2002-01-09 00:15:00;5 mins;UFO sighting in North Jersey I was in my car and saw a bright light to the right of me I looked up and I thought it was a plane comming down. Then as it got closer I realized that it wasn't in the shape off a plane it was circular. It had two bright lights in the front of it like head lights and around it were little white lights with a few green and red. It was comming down fast, so it seemed, circling down to the ground and then it was gone. out of sight or dissapeared. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) I believe that it was in rutherford...I was actually getting on route 3 west out of lyndhurst when I saw it. And it was in the direction of Rutherford.;40.8318;-74.121
