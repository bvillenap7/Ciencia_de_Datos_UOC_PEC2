triangular crafts with bright lights and no sound.;2013-12-18 18:15:00;6 hours;triangular crafts with bright lights and no sound While driving , there were two very bright lights that were extremely close , they were stationary for A while until we came to a stop sign.  Then they began moving over us.  They were triangular crafts with 3 bright white lights that formed a triangle.  Total silence.  Throughout the rest of the night there were many of those same bright balls of light in the sky but more distant and couldn't tell the shape, but they moved back and forth glowing bright then dim, then bright again.   \ I'm trying to find a logical explanation but it's impossible.;39.8477;-75.0732
