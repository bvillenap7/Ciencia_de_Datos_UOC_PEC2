Star? Moving Rapidly Across the sky maintaining altitude.;2004-12-25 06:00:00;1 minutes;Star? Moving Rapidly Across the sky maintaining altitude. I looked up from my yard 6AM Christmas morning and I saw what was as high as and what looked like a star directly overhead. It then began moving across the sky northward until it was out of site.  This was too high to be an airplane and it moved quite fast and looked simply like a star moving across the sky but very fast. It was solid white like a star, no blinking lights. It maintined the same altitude when moving, this was not a falling star. There was also no trail.  I surely don't know if this was a space craft or a craft of any sort but it was an Unidentified Flying Object, thus this report.  Didn't know about your site until seeing the Peter Jennings report.;39.885;-75.0776
