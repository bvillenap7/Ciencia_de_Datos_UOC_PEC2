An apparent high flying airplane began to make improbable changes in direction. My wife and I were outside at midnight for the sake of our dog. I was watching our dog when suddenly my wife called to me to look up at the sky, to the south but nearly over head. Finally I saw what she was seeing.  It had about the dim visibility of a high flying plane.  But it made odd curved motions at what must have been fantastic speeds and changes of path that shouldn't have been possible.  Because we are near a major airport, there was air traffic visible with which to compare this object. It did not seem to be an airplane.  It was a light in the sky. But was it just reflecting moonlight or was it lit? I wonder if any of the flight crews saw what we did?;39.885;-75.0776
