Red, white, bluish green pulsating light.;2014-09-22 21:15:00;15 minutes;Red, white, bluish green pulsating light. Shortly after 21:00 hours, I noticed a reddish light in the sky north of my house. Thinking it missionary. Mars, I went in to get binoculars.  When I looked through the binoculars I saw a red flashing light, a white pulsating light and possibly a blue and/or green light I was not able to discern a shape.   I watched for nearly 15 minutes and the object remained stationary. I went into the house for a couple of minutes and the object had disappeared when I went back out.;40.9988;-74.4261
