No boats/ships below, no evidence of a rocket from a boat.  Lights would come on one, two, and then a group, looking like a rash or pimples.  Observed once for about 10 seconds, then disappeared.  Reappeared in the same pattern again after about 30-45 seconds, and then twice more.  Upon reflection, would have been how lights on a rotating object might appear, with a dark interval.  Lights were remarkably bright.  After a final appearance of about 14 seconds in a similar pattern, they disappeared.  Lights moved slightly to the southwest during this viewing.
