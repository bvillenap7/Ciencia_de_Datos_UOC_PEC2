My wife was showing me the constellations.  It was a clear night because it had rained the entire day before.  Not a cloud in the sky.  We were both looking towards the sky when I turned to look towards the south.  She immediately calls my name and says Look!!!.  Right above our heads the formation flew.  It couldn't have been any more than 10,000 feet above our heads.  It looked like 5 white circles in a line and another one immediately to the side.  You could see a faint outline around them as if they were art of a larger craft.  Not very big, however.  It was late at night.  No noise and a clear night sky.  No lights on to dim the view so it was clear as day.;40.2255291793313;-74.7244765957449
