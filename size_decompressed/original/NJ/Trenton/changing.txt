I and 3 other members of my family were on the front porch.  I noticed a long white object in the sky at 2:00.  They was slated in the sky (8:00-2:00) and moved very slowly.  Enough that I couldn't really tell.   First it was one.  Three minutes later, another one appeared seemingly out of the clouds.  I became very interested at the time and brought it to the other's attention.  A few minutes later, another appeared and then another and then another.  A total of five of these objects moving across the sky in file - as if you were writing on lined paper.  This is what they looked like...  / / / / / They were in the sky for 15 minutes or so.  They reached a point in the sky where they changed shape (curved)and moved up until they could not be seen anymore.  It looked like this... ) / / / / and then U ////.  In order they went up... U U / / /.... U U U / /. Then they were gone.  It was amazing.  I'm curious if there was anyone else who might have seen what I saw.
