Moving light around a stationary object...;1997-11-13 21:15:00;2 Minutes;Moving light around a stationary object... As my friends and I were walking home from a store, we we're looking at the sky, and noticed a white light rovolving around what seemed to be a star.  The light was too high to be a plane or heliocopter.  As we were watching it, it revolved around the star 5 times, and then as it got right over my head, the white revolving light flashed very bright.  My friends and I went inside to get the attention of our parents, and when we came out and looked in the exact same spot that the star and the light were, they were gone, and there were no clouds in the sky at that time.;40.2255291793313;-74.7244765957449

There paths criss-crossed I was outside in my garden watching the sky and I saw in the course of a few minutes 2 slow moving meteors (There were moving very fast but slow compared to meteors I have seen before.) 5 to seven seconds each. I went in to get my wfe as I though there may have been a meteor shower going on. She came out and within a minute she and I saw seven points of light moving closely together in the same direction at the same speed. They appeared to be crossing each others paths and seems to come closer together as the moved accros the sky. This event occured over the space of between 15 and twenty seconds. The movement was extremely fast and somewhat organic. The objects moved over 1/3 of the arc of the sky. The lights were about as bright as a star but more of a yellow/orange color.;40.2255291793313;-74.7244765957449
Moving flying object filmed from flight from Orlando to Albany;2020-01-13 17:38:00;20 minutes;Moving flying object filmed from flight from Orlando to Albany 	I was on Frontier Airlines flight F91006, with direct service from Orlando, FL to Albany, NY on January 13th, 2020.&#8232 	At 5:30 pm, I looked out the window and noticed a bright light. The light hung directly above the cloud line. At first, I thought it may have been a tall building or another plane, but I saw the city lights below and realized that no building would have been tall enough to reach such heights. I realized it wasn’t another plane as the light stayed consistent and did not move. I watched it for a few moments and saw another plane in the distance fly in front of it.  At that point, I was able to gauge the size of it. The plane that flew in front of the light appeared small compared to the light behind it. At that point, I decided to take a photo.&#8232 	Moments later, I heard a few other passengers talking about the strange light. I did not engage with them. The light stayed in the same place. If the light had been sitting in the exact same place, it would have moved out of sight of my window. It stayed in the exact same place relative to my window. That’s when I realized the light must have been moving at the same speed that we were flying. That’s when I began filming at 5:38 pm.&#8232	After a few moments, the light ascended from the position it sat at for about 5 minutes. It moved upward and then started to make unnatural movements laterally. Over the course of about 3 minutes it moved higher into the sky and continued to make unnatural movements to the left and right. The light would occasionally pause and remain still for a few moments. &#8232 	Eventually, the light moved back toward the rear of the plane and I could no longer see it out the window.&#8232	 The city I listed is an approximate location based on the time and flight path that I looked up after I landed. &#8232 	Unfortunately, I had fallen asleep at some point during my flight. I woke up from some rough turbulence and some unusual electrical activity on the plane. (Seatbelt sign turning on and off, flickering lights.) I looked out the window when I woke up and I immediately saw the light. Unfortunately I cannot account for where the light came from and how it manifested because I was asleep prior to seeing it. &#8232 	I will email photographic and video evidence to the email address provided.;40.2255291793313;-74.7244765957449
