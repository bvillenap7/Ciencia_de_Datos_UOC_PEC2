I was home having just finished work laying flat on my back watching the night sky.  Observed formation of 5 or 6 circular disks flying in straight line.  Appeared to be connected as if part of the same object.  Only the edges of each disk were illuminated orange/red.  Center of each disk was dark.    Objects were directly over head flying South to North.  Covered the horizon in approximately 5-6 seconds.   No sound.   At first, thought it was space junk catching sun's reflection.  But it was moving very fast.   Just curious if this was typical space junk sighting or something else. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
