When I looked up at the stars and noticed a bright star shooting up, down, left and right. It moved very fast. Then it appeared that it was trying to find a good place to unload something. It found a spot to stop then three smaller light objects ejected from the big light and dispersed. At this point I jumped out of the pool, and I was running home to get a witness and I saw my pop who was a police officer driving down the street. He and I watched the larger bright light for along time  He dismissed it as a satellite. I have seen satellites in the sky and they orbit, they dont stop and move up,down and left and right in milliseconds. I know what I saw and there is no doubt it was not of this planet.

Several red lights moving toward the south/southwest, one by one over Collingswood, NJ;2015-04-11 11:30:00;15 minutes;Several red lights moving toward the south/southwest, one by one over Collingswood, NJ I and two others saw a series of red lights pass overhead, one by one. There had to have been 15-20 or more in succession, over about a 10-15 minute time span. They made no sound, which I pointed out to the other two witnesses, who confirmed that they made no sound.   One of the other witnesses wondered aloud if they were some experimental craft on a test flight.   They were coming from the horizon to the North/Northwest, and moving toward the South/Southwest. The strangest part was that each one started to dim as they approached the zenith. and faded until they disappeared entirely by about 10 degrees past zenith from our position. One witness took cell phone video of one of the lights.   I could put you in touch with the person who took the video, if you contact me via email;39.9152;-75.0739
