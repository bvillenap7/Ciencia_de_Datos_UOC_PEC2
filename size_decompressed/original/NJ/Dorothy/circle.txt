Bright red, no-blinking light, no sound, no other lights.;2016-05-21 20:58:00;3 minutes;Bright red, no-blinking light, no sound, no other lights Saw a solid red light with a slight aura coming from the SSE and heading to the NNW for approx. 3 min.  Looked like it was following a normal approach route to Phila. Int. Airport. Guessing altitude was approx. 2000 feet.   Absoulutely no sound.  Light never blinked.  No other lights were visible.  Red light looked much larger than any other light I usually see on other aircraft on this flight path at approx. the same altitude.  Again, light never blinked.   Sky was overcast, but I could see some stars and other aircraft.   Watched it head in a NNW direction at same altitude and brightness, until it flew out of sight.;39.3956;-74.829
