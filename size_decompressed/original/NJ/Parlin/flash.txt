Looked like Venus but then faded out.;2015-11-03 18:30:00;1 minute;Looked like Venus but then faded out At about 6:30 PM, I was sitting outside, looking up 45 degrees from the horizon to the south, and saw what looked like the planet, Venus, because of its brightness, and was stationary.   As I was looking at it after about 10 seconds it started fading out to a brightness of a dim star.  Eventually I couldn’t see it anymore.   I don’t think it was a plane because it stayed in the same spot. I’d like to know what that was.  Do you know of any idea what that could have been?;40.4605;-74.3039
