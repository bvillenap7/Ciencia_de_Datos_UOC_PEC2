I work for the new jersey department of transportaion and in the new jersey national guard. I am 31 years old and married.  I was smoking a cigrette on my balacony and was looking up at the sky. It was night and very clear out. I saw a white dot fly across the sky with amazing speed, much faster then any airplane I have seen in the sky. behind the white dot was a blue line behind it. It went into the clouds and disappeared.  I have never witnessed something flying so fast in the sky like that before. I would not have thought much of the object, but the blue line behind it made me think it was a UFO. I only saw one of these objects;40.4605;-74.3039
