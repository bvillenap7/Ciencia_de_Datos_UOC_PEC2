Video evidence of several circle fireballs traveling in a line in the sky.;2018-07-03 22:00:00;3 minutes;Video evidence of several circle fireballs traveling in a line in the sky. On a clear July summer night (2018), I was by myself, relaxing outside, star gazing, when I looked up to my right and noticed a bright glowing circle fireball.  I locked eyes on this object floating traveling to the left of me.  My first thought was, it’s just a  drone flying over me.   Once I saw the second and third one following behind one another I immediately pulled out my phone and started recording on snap chat because I knew at that point it was not a drone (there was no noise).  Beautiful orange and red fire like motion to it all traveling at the same speed, same motion, in a perfect straight line.  I was scared but I was frozen at the same time amazed at what these objects could possibly be.  Then once I thought that was it, a 4th, 5th, and 6th object flying directly in line of the others.  I followed these objects recording on my phone until I couldn’t see them anymore.  I waited a little bit longer to see if there was a 7th or more but that was it.  As I’m stu! dying these objects on my phone,  I recall seeing almost the same thing as a late teen on the beach at night over the horizon in south New Jersey a new times.  The only difference is one fire ball split into 4-5 separate fire balls, hovering over the horizon.  Then they all form back into one fire ball then disappeared super fast.;40.4605;-74.3039
