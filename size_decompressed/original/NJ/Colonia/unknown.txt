I was in bed when I heard the loudest aircraft I have ever heard. This was not a sighting I was wondering if anyone did see anything around this time. I looked out my window a little to late but could hear this craft for a continuing 10 - 15 minutes. I have never in my life heard an ything like this.;40.5916;-74.3179
Multi-colored aircraft sighted in Colonia, NJ.;2014-08-26 21:00:00;3 minutes;Multi-colored aircraft sighted in Colonia, NJ. At first my brother and I thought it was a plane, until we noticed the light sequencing and the behavior/maneuvering.   It was flashing three different colors in sequence order.  Moving slowly, it changed altitude pretty quickly, and moved from east to west to north in no set directional order.   The flight pattern was inconsistent with a plane, helicopter, drone, or anything we are familiar with.   My brother thought it was someone messing around with a toy, until it turned off its lights after a couple of minutes and flew north out of sight.   Within 30 seconds of it flying away, a plane flew right past its previous location - we speculated that it turned off its lights after seeing the plane coming in its direction. Cannot guarantee this was an actual sighting, but it was absolutely NOT a plane or a typical aircraft.  Very interesting and unusual situation.
