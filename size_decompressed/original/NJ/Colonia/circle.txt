Orange circle no noise hovering for 30-40 seconds, moved a little, hovered then moving very slowly until out of sight.;2014-08-17 21:00:00;4 minutes;orange circle no noise hovering for 30-40 seconds,moved a little, hovered then moving very slowly until out of sight Husband and wife walking around 9:00 pm – saw a orange round light in sky – we 1st thought it was a shooting star at first glance but realized going too slow.   It stayed the same size in our area for about 30-40 seconds and then moved away a little – west to east, then seemed to stand still again, but may have been moving farther away in a horizontal direction which would have been harder to distinguish but the light stayed approx the same size…   After a while 2-3 minutes it starting getting farther away noticeably (going south) until we could not see it.  The glow stayed orange and round the entire time – even when direction had started turning.   It had no sound – which was noted because other planes had come near – not nearly as close as this was and the noise was definitely discernible.   A neighbor was driving down the street and stopped as she had seen us looking into the sky and she too saw, and was trying to get a picture on her phone/camera –but said it looked like a little dot by the time she had gotten her phone out…   We had no phone/camera with us.
