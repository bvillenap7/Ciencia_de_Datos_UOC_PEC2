White glowing light that drifted and eventually stay suspended.;2016-02-02 13:00:00;25 minutes;White glowing light that drifted and eventually stay suspended. I work on Main St. in West Orange, NJ.  Just now, me and 3 fellow employees witnessed a glowing white light high up in the sky.  When I first saw it, I thought it was a white supermarket plastic bag because it drifted as if the wind was taking it.  I thought it was up rather high for a plastic bag and especially that it wasn't coming down.  But it continued to drift pretty far and remained suspended high in the air for a good 20-25 minutes.  It was a bright white light that would consistently turn on and off, which was very visible.  It was in the sky enough for me to round up 3 employees to view it with me.   It seemed to either drift further away or disappear until we couldn't see it anymore.;40.7869000000001;-74.2534999999999
