10 - 14 reddish-orange spheres flying slowly over northern NJ.;2012-08-08 23:05:00;10 minutes;10 - 14 reddish-orange spheres flying slowly over northern NJ. Aug. 4th, 2012  11:05pm EST West Orange, NJ  07052 At 11:05pm on August 4, 2012 my son and I pulled into our driveway.  I noticed 3 strange reddish-orange spheres in the sky and so parked to look.  As we watched, I noticed that they were slowly moving from a southern position towards the east.  More appeared that were following the first.  I unrolled the windows and turned the car off to listen for noise (plane and helicopter traffic is common in our area).  There was no noise noticeable.  We sat and watched 10 to 12 of these lights all head in the same direction.  I then pulled the car into the garage and put my son to bed.  I then went upstairs and looked out my east facing bedroom window and witnessed what appeared to be 2 more (or was it the final 2 in the parade we had witness out front?) heading over the trees to the east.  This sighting lasted approximately 10 minutes.;40.7869000000001;-74.2534999999999
