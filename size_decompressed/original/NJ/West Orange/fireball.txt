I figured it was At approximately 5:45pm my girlfriend stepped outside and noticed a UFO in the sky and called me outside. I figured it was probably a plane since Newark airport isn't far away and we frequently have airplanes overhead.  At 5:53pm we noticed a single bright ball of light in the distant sky.  We both felt this was NOT an airplane so she got her camera out.  Then slowly more objects appeared.  The largest/original object grew smaller as it appeared to move away from us.  Simultaneously, one by one, up to 6 objects appeared in the same area of sky.  Then they seemed to move into a single file formation for a duration.  Then this single file formation was broken and the objects spread out and slowly got smaller and disappeared from our visibility.  They appeared to be flying south - southeast (away from us). A mother and daughter came up to the front porch to drop off local political campaign flyers and they saw them as well and were dumbfounded. My girlfriend's 8yr old son saw them too. He quickly went inside because things like this can scare him. At first we thought they were planes reflecting the setting sunlight. However, there were several airplanes in the area and it was obvious by the naked eye and in the photographs that these looked much different and weren't planes. When you zoom into the photos you will see airplanes for comparison. The second theory was that they were meteorites/space debris but they don't change flight paths the way these did. My girlfriend, a professional photographer, got her Canon 5D camera out with Canon 70-300mm zoom lens and took pictures. The picture names have numbers in them so you can see the order of occurrence and track the flight paths accordingly. I still thought they could be planes but when we viewed her pictures on her computer it became evident that they weren't. I have uploaded a zip file containing 34 pictures for your review.  Because the photos are 10-13mb each, I used WeTransfer to send you the zip file of the photos.
