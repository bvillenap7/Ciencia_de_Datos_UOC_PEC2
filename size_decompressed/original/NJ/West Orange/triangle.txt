UFO Triangular flying objects with red flashing lights in Northern New Jersey;2004-01-06 20:00:00;1 Hour 15 min;UFO Triangular flying objects with red flashing lights in Northern New Jersey Well this is one of the two times i saw them.  I saw these while at a friends bbq and there were about six of us who witnessed it.  We even tried to video tape it but it didn't work out.  It was in the middle of the night I think it was of January of 2004 I was on winter break from college.  It was probably around 8 PM and we saw a flashing red object which was very bright in the sky.  At first we all thought it was a star but it was way to large and close to us to be one.  I thought it was a missle because it appeared to be moving and thought it was coming towards us.  We were all really skeptical until the object started moving in another direction.  People were saying it was an airplane but no airplane moves that quickly and can move in a variety of different directions at that speed.  The object moved up and down and left and right.  An airplane could not do that.  The red object also hovered in the sky for a while then elevated it self higher into the sky.  Definitely not an airplane.  As the object flew higher it came closer to the moon and pretty much covered it in the night sky.  It was at this point that maybe six or more smaller triangular aircrafts flew out of it.  The small aircrafts flew right beneath and scattered all over the sky and it had to be a scatter of 10 miles in diameter.  These small triangle aircrafts also flashed  red lights and flew all over the place way to fast and agile to be an airplane or jet.  After a while we all saw helicopters and we thought they were government helicopters but it seemed very out of place to me.  Helicopters out of no where near Newark, New Jersey, very strange.  The helicopters were black and seemed dark since it was at night.  The strange thing was that the two helicopters look like they were tracking the red flashing objects in the sky but as soon as those helicopters came out chasing them the red flashing objects simply disappeared.  After the red flashing triangle like aircrafts disappeared the black helicopters hung around for a while using spot lights.  They even got close to the house we were in. They had to be only a few miles up in the air.    We all just thought of it as nothing but its really hard not to admit it.  We never talked about it again.  I assume that it was government related and if not that then it was definitely something foreign and not of this world.  I definitely know we weren't all seeing things because we turned on the radio and people in northern NJ area reported the Flashing red lights on 1010 winds i think its called . (The AM radio station channel).  Also down the street was a restaurant filled with people coming out to the parking lot after eating dinner who all witnessed the flying objects as well.  I am going to write another report since I witnessed these same objects a second time more recently in April of 2006 in Washington, D.C.
