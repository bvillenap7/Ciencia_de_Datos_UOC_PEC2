I remarked how bright it looked.  My husband replied that it was too bright to be the moon.  I proceeded to take some photos.  After a short while my husband went into the house. I continued to observe this, for what I thought was only a short time, but my husband recalls it being around 45 minutes.  The time recorded on the pictures supports my husbandâ€™s recollection of time.  The first photo taken at 9:23 p.m., the second photo at 9:24 p.m., the third photo at 10:17 and the fourth photo taken at 10:18 p.m.  Spanning a total time of 54 minutes of the object silently hovering above our house.;40.0542;-74.9079
