Flash of light, followed by 2 white disks.  ((anonymous report));2018-09-29 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;Flash of light followed by 2 white disks. While walking outside to have a smoke, I observed 2 disk shaped craft moving at an immense rate of speed, emanating from the South and heading North.  There was a flash that could be seen throughout what from my perspective appeared to be the entirety of the sky, and that's when I noticed these 2 disks.
