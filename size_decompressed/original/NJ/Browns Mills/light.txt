Object that moved in sky  couldn't have been made in this world.;2001-02-28 19:15:00;3 mins;Object that moved in sky  couldn't have been made in this world. It was a clear and very dark night. I was looking at the craters on the moon(quarter) and then I started looking at the stars to the left of the moon. I observed through my binoculars a light moving downward at a very rapid rate of speed. I moved them from my eyes and I could no longer see the object.I looked through them again, and again I could see the object still moving down rapidly. All at once it stopped. I looked again without the glasses and I couldn't see it, placing the glasses back to my eyes I could see it. It began moving down again rapidly, all at once the object moved vertically right in a straight line very rapidly covering a great distance. And just as quickly it moved back vertically left past the center line it had been decending at originally.It did this five times in a diamond type shape very rapidly. When it stopped doing this it again started in a rapid straight line decent until out of sight.;39.9564;-74.5666
