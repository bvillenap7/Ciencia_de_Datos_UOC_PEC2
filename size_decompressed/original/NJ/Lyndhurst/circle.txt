A VERIFABLE UFO encounter... Holloman AFB 5/6,1974;1974-05-27 17:00:00;2hrs;A VERIFABLE UFO encounter...  Holloman AFB 5/6,1974   I had travelled to Odessa Tx with my roommate (((name deleted)) of Calif.) to his sisters house in Odessa for the weekend.   We left Odessa, then a small town, and headed home on rt. 385. we headed West on 185 to N.Mex. and Holloman where we were stationed. We had spent the Holiday weekend with his sister and neice.  When we left Odessa we headed North on 385 to Seminole and grabbed a coffee.  We then continued to Hobbs before we turned West.  We were on Hwy #529 then headed for Artesia.  It was an 'empty' land back then.  After the #180 junction, and we knew where we were going, we stopped, to take a leak.  Back then the land was empty and dark.  Not like my NYC my home... so here it gets strange.  We stopped about 1/8mile outside town to take a leak near a phone booth.  We got back in the car and started to drive and in about 1/4mile a UFO appeared in the sky, it came from the west and stopped about 250ft above us, it was hovering on us.  Jim pushed it to 140mph. and it held, we slowed to 20mph and it held we stopped, and got out.  It had sparks flying out of it when we stopped...and I said to Jim, it looks like it is having trouble, Jim agreed. It was 11:15pm then...next time we looked it was 12:30pm.  We got back in his car and tried to outrace it we couldn't (we went 160mph) we slowed and it did not leave. The entire incident to point was about 5.5miles in duration, an 2hrs.  Then we saw 3 F-4's with BLUE tails headed towards us. We knew the planes because we were their mechanics. The round, UFO was still sparking when we stopped to watch... then, in an instant it was hundreds of miles away to the North West, at the base of the upcoming mountains (near Roswell)(NOT ARTESIA)... the F-4's, OUR PLANES made the 120 degree turn to pursue the craft and it had gone from here to there (300miles) in an instant. It was a 60 degreee turn, with no radius, and just a simple 140mph backwards motion to a simple 60 degree turn to the Northwest.  The Planes arced over our heads, and thier efforts seemed so insignificant to the speed the craft was able to move at.  The Saucer, and it was a 'saucer' this time moved from the center of the flat desert where we were...to the near side of the upcoming mountains in 1 second, what our planes could do in 20 about 200miles! I need to go back there and drive it again. I want to! I wish i could find ((name deleted)) od Calif. My Air Force friend to remember again. The whole base was in an uproar and at TOP-LEVEL Security when we got in at 5am... and alot of incidents occurred after that date...alot of CONFIRMATION took place and the base, which allowed us to drink cases of beer at TRINITY SITE was closed by ARMY troops. When we headed to Trinity that friday we were all of a sudden surrounded by armed troops turning us back. Two weeks later there were 1,000's of lights in the sky... and anyone that was stationed there then can realate them... was that our real first encounter??? I Don't know I only know what I and Jim saw, and what happened.;40.8137;-74.1234
