UFO sited on fire - forest fire later reported caused by F-16 flare exercise;2007-05-15 08:00:00;2 Minutes;UFO sited on fire - forest fire later reported caused by F-16 flare exercise Me and my girlfriend were driving to work in the morning when I noticed what I thought was a helicopter on fire in the sky above route 3 approaching Clifton, NJ.  We pulled over and were planning to call authorities but when we stopped we noticed the object was not a helicopter at all.  The object continued to fly south east.  The interesting thing about this is the smoke seemed to be pulled into a circle around the object (disc shaped) - and all around it.  Later that day a report of a fire started to come out in the news about a forest fire which reportedly was caused by a flare from a test run from an F-16.  Me and my girlfriend are sure government involvement in a fire never happens and we just happen to witness an unknown object heading at high speeds in that direction while on fire.  It was not going slow - it reach out of viewing distance very quickly after we stopped, but was hovering at the time when we stopped.
