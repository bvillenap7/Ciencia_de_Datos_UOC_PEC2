Sighting on I-78.;2015-04-02 03:50:00;2-3 seconds;Sighting on I-78. I was traveling on I-78 at approximately 3:50am by exit 24, when for whatever reason I decided to look up at the sky.  Towards the right of the highway I noticed what I thought was a star (because it was momentarily stationary) until it streaked across the sky and disappeared.   I definitely know for act that it was not a shooting star because I have seen them before and this did not resemble a shooting star.  It was undoubtedly a UFO because the distance in which it streaked and disappeared was so short.;40.6484;-74.8245
