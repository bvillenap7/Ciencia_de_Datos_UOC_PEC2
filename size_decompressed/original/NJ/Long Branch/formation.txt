Never something like this before!  We saw as SEVERAL, LIKE MAYBE 7-10 lights in orb shapes mover up (no gas trail/light trail? and were in a formation of a diamondish or rough hexagon shape!   Then we saw 2 or 3 until 1 at a time!  Could NOT have been flare: no trail/did not get brighter.  Was kind of a consistent glowing orb shape!   What was it!?!?!;40.2993;-73.9890999999999
