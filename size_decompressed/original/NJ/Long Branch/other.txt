A friend and I were on the balcony when we noticed a weird shaped object that was dark, flying at a steady pace from north to south.  I got a picture on my digital camera and a few minutes later, I took a picture of a plane flying in the opposite direction.  You can clearly see the difference.  The ufo was steady and rather far away, yet clearly was not a normal looking object. It was an irregular shape and almost seemed impossible to be flying.  Even on the camera, you can see either air displacement or heat disbursement around the object.  I have only told close friends and family about this and they have all agreed that it is a rare occasion.;40.2993;-73.9890999999999
