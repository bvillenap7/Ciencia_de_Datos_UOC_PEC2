((anonymous report));2017-11-01 04:00:00;5-10 minutes;Between 3 and 6 a.m over the Atlantic Ocean there is always a lot of activity. I'm going to be simple, I live near the Atlantic Ocean, I can look out the window and see the water.  Between 3 and 6 a.m there is always activity in the sky.  But specifically in November is when I seen a craft for the first time.  It was black, shaped like a triangle, and moving in an abnormal way, gliding along.  Other than that nearly every morning when I get up there's always activity in the sky weird lights that look like portals or something, you guys need to look into it, I don't know who else to tell.
