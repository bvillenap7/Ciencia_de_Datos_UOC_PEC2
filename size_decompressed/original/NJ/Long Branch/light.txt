Two bright lights off Long Branch, NJ over the Atlantic Ocean;2008-04-05 17:30:00;2 Minutes;Two bright lights off Long Branch, NJ over the Atlantic Ocean Today I was standing outside and a bright star over the Atlantic ocean caught my eye. At first I thought it was just an early bright star, kind of like when you see the moon early in the afternoon. The sky was very clear. I figured it might be a star because the sun was now in the west, behind me.  It was very high in the sky. It had height similar to a star or even a satellite moving in low orbit, but was stationary. We live in an area that does not have high light pollution, so at night (especially in the summers) we are able to see satellites at night when they fly over. Our views are so good that one evening last year we were able to see a NOSS satellite group fly over.  I was able to gauge the height when an aircraft was flying at what appeared to be it's maximum altitude to the left of the star and the star was much higher than the aircraft. I knew the aircraft was high due to its jet stream. There were also two birds flying at a height that dismissed the chance of the star being a balloon.  Suddenly a second light appeared and was aligned in a way similar to Orion's belt.  The second star seemed to have started to move slowly below the first star. In order to make sure the second star was moving I closed one eye and used my finger as marker and sure enough the lower star was moving in a southern direction.  Literally, in a blink of an eye the moving star was gone. It just disappeared. No flash or high acceleration, just gone.  I was looking back to the first star when it too disappeared.  I waited for a few more minutes for the stars to reappear but they did not.  This has been bothering me all day so I decided to post it here to see if anyone else has seen it.;40.2993;-73.9890999999999
Bright light in sky pointing down. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 20:00:00;1 minute;Bright light in sky pointing down. Sitting in backyard facing south, all of a sudden a bright ball of light appeard very high and the light lit up the sky from point of origin to the ground in a cone shape, it looked like the object was in space  and poked the light into the atmosphere, it then dimed out leaving the area it lit bright until eventually it went dark. I also want to note that Jupiter was east of this object so it was not a planet ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
