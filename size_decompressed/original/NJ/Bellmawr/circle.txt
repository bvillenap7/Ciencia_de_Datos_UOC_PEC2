Quickly moving sphere of alternating colors passing about 10 miles east of Philadelphia the night of July 4th, 2020;2020-07-04 21:30:00;15 seconds;Quickly moving sphere of alternating colors passing about 10 miles east of Philadelphia the night of July 4th, 2020 Moving south to north at a high rate of speed, was a round sphere of alternating colors.  I spotted the object moving towards us and passing directly over our heads, as we were in my friend’s backyard.  I quickly called out my observation, and at least four other adults witnessed the object and the flashing colors.  The other witnesses were minors, but they saw the object as well.  It was moving quickly and was not very high in the night sky, but it wasn’t low either.  No sounds could be heard from the object.  One theory was that it could possibly have been a drone of some type, but overall size appeared much too large to be a drone.  None of the witnesses were intoxicated, and range in age from 35 to 47.  Three of the witnesses were male, and two were female.;39.8674486486487;-75.0950810810811
