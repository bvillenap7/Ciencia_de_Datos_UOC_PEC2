An Orange/Red Light over Northern Jew Jersey;2008-11-09 05:45:00;@ 1 hour and a half;An Orange/Red Light over Northern Jew Jersey Sighting from Maplewood, NJ - Memorial Park - Between 5:45pm EST and 7:10 EST - From the corner of Valley and Oakview Ave. Looking South East - In my best estimation it would have put the light somewhere in the area between Mountainside, Berkley Heights and New Providence. Between 5:45pm EST and 7:10 EST   I noticed a light in the sky that seemed to drift very slightly left and right as well as up and down. It was pulsing mostly orange but did turn red a few times. The light remained in the basic vicinity of the sky for about an hour and a half. I used binoculars and could only make out a pulsing light. The light was as magnificent without the binoculars as it was with. Brighter than any star and certainly not a plane. I watched this pulse and orange to red glow for a good hour. I changed vantage points so that I could balance the binoculars on something solid to reduce the shaking. At this point it was a lot easier to see. Bright pulsing orange fading into red. Then it suddenly turned greenish/blue and faded out. There were no clouds or trees or any obstructions to accomplish this. It seemed to distinguish itself or disappear. About 2 minutes later a greenish/blue light appeared again very small and it faded right back to an orange brilliant pulse. I watched it for another half hour as it drifted very slightly. Then with out warning it disappeared completely. No streak or trail. Just poof!!!!;40.7304;-74.2727
