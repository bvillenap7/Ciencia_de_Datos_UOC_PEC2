My attention was drawn to three lights in the sky.  We stopped the car and got out.  We walked around the car and watched three lights move in vertical and horizontal directions.  There were three different color lights.  Like white, red, white. I am 23, other two witnesses, 27, 10.  We watched the three lights close in together and become one light and then dropped straight down.  It covered a large area in only the 20 seconds.   There are many planes out also, none of them were moving the same as these lights.;39.7766;-74.9285
