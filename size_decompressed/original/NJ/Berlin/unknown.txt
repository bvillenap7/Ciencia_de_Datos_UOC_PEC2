On Monday, Nov. 3, 2014, at 7:20 pm my husband and I saw a strange light in the north sky. There were some clouds in the sky but the light hovered in a clear space.  It was the light quality that first caught my attention it didn’t appear natural.  It was a clear, bright white light with red and green lights underneath.  It was at a distance (maybe 40+ miles) so there was no sound.  I can’t accurately describe the shape because of the distance.  If I had to guess the shape, I would say it was like a slightly squat football turned on its point.  We viewed it through binoculars and could see that it was pulsating.  There were red and green lights that glowed and blinked from underneath the object.  We passed the binoculars back and forth between us, trying to figure out what it was.  We ruled out a star, comet/meteorite and a plane.  I wonder if a helicopter would look like this from a distance at night? I was tempted to get in the car and drive to where it was hovering, but I was too afraid to get closer to it.  We observed it for about 10 minutes and it was still there when we went inside our home.  Since the object was so far away, I hesitated to report this but I can’t stop thinking about it and decided to put the information online in case someone else in the area saw it and has a better description.;39.7766;-74.9285
