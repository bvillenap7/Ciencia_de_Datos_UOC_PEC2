Like i could feel it observing me I was around 7 years old, we just came back from a Christmas event for kids at the vfw in a nearby town.  I was outside on the front lawn playing with a boardgame I got at the event and had a strange feeing something was looking at me.  I looked up and approx. 20-30 feet above my head was an object that I thought was falling toward me and I scrambled into the bushes near where I was sitting,  I turned around from beneath the bushes and looked up and there was a cylindrical object, looked kinda like a duffel bag painted silver with some what looked like smoke stains near the bottom and it was hovering.  I ran in the house and got my mom, she came out and when she did it had slowly risen and was gaining altitude and proceeding across the street.when I pointed it out to her it was at least a couple hundred feet away and slowly gaining altitude and speed, though still fairly slow.  It then started to tumble as it gained altitude and proceeded over the field across the ! street still gaining altitude till it was no longer visible.   it traveled fairly slow and tumbled in a controlled fashion.  I thought it made some kind of intermittent beeping but with a good pause between tones.  About all I remember, was just a kid.  My dad made fun of me later  But my mom always told me not to worry about him. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));39.7766;-74.9285
