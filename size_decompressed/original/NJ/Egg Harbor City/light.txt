Five very bright orange lights just over  tree line in New Jresey pine lands.;2006-03-01 19:00:00;10 minutes;Five very bright orange lights just over  tree line in New Jresey pine lands. I was in my kitchen and looked out the window and saw the first tiny slit of the moon, it had been a new moon two days before and it was just starting to reappear. I decided to go and have a look. As I walked out my front door, through the trees I saw a bright orange light. It was in the opposite direction of the moon, NW I think. It was very bright and I thought it was a little strange so I walked out to a clearing to get a better look with no trees in the way.When I was able to get an unobstructed view, in the distance, maybe 2-3 miles just above the tree line, I saw the extremely bright orange light, not moving. Then it quickly faded out.Then, just as it faded out, a little to the left another bright orange light lit up, then another, then again until there was four lights in a row. One by one they would light up until all four were lit. Then they would quickly fade as the first one did. The first lone light would come on again, then fade. Then one by one, the four other lights would come on, then quickly fade. This went on for about ten minutes. The weather conditions that night were extremely clear. This is a rural area, at the base of the New Jersey Pine Lands, very few homes in that direction, no industry. Very flat landscape.;39.5333;-74.6144
