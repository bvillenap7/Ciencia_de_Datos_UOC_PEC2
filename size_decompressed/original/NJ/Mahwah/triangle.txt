Triangle shaped flying, hovering U.F.O. witnessed over Sheraton Hotel in Mahwah, NJ. on 10/10/04.;2004-10-10 02:50:00;2 - 3 minutes;Triangle shaped flying, hovering U.F.O. witnessed over Sheraton Hotel in Mahwah, NJ. on 10/10/04. It was 10/10/04, 2:50AM.  I was at the Sheraton Hotel on one of the top floors facing west.  I just happened to look out of the hotels large room window and saw what looked like a light on top of a tall building abour half a mile away.  I didn't remember seeing this very tall building earlier that day but shrugged it off.   As I began to turn and go back to bed I witnessed the light begin to move towards the hotel.  I thought it might be a helicopter...but at 2:50AM??  Anyway, the light began to take the shape of a triangle with blinking colored lights on the bottom of it.  The object than slowly hovered it seemed right over the top of the hotel over my room.   That's when I most definitely saw a triangle flying hovering object not making any sound or noises.  It was completely silent.   At that point, the object disappeared out of sight.   I caught the elevator down to the lobby of the building as fast as I could, looked outside to the east in the direction the object was! headed but it was no where in sight.  I began to tell the desk clerk what I had saw but he looked at me like I was crazy or on something.  I said never mind, went back to my room and didn't fall asleep until the sun began shining through that same window.   Whenever I tell this story, no one beleives me, so I am asking you guys to beleive me. I have no reason to lie....what for?  True story, you have my word on it.
