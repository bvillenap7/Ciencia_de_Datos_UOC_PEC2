Me and my girlfriend were in the parking lot of our complex talking to her friend when I caught a blue circle heading west over the sky;2014-10-25 20:30:00;30 seconds;Me and my girlfriend were in the parking lot of our complex talking to her friend when I caught a blue circle heading west over the skyline then took an instant 90 degree turn south then then another 90 degree turn heading back east and then one more turn south in which time it shot straight up a couple hundred feet and then shot off south out of sight.    I was in the air force and know what craft look like in the sky day and night and can tell you which craft it is usually by its sound.  This WAS NOT one of ours.  Those moves do not jive with our basic understandings of physics.   I do know that there was a commercial jet in the background id say a couple miles south of the sighting and am curious if anyone else seen this.;41.0824806451613;-74.1857419354839
