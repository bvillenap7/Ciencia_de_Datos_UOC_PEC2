UFO hovering over mine shaft caught it from 35 yards away with my iPhone;2011-03-06 10:28:00;3 min;UFO hovering over mine shaft caught it from 35 yards away with my iPhone At aprox. 10:30 pm I was on a nightly hike I do in Harrimen state park on the boarder on NJ and NY. I was about 4.6 miles into the trail and I saw what I thought was ground light over the next summit on the trail. It looked exactly like HID lights from a new car but I'm 4.6 miles away from any road. I had just called my wife and she sent me a text so I had my iPhone out while I was walking. I took the phone out and i tired the hi res camera on and started to take video. As I came over the top of the hill I saw a very bright disk.  As I saw it I yelled out loud, the disk took of instantly from the ground with no noise more  rapid then anything I have ever seen. It was the size of a black hawk helicopter and as it pushed off the ground it displaced all of the air in the area making a soft wind much less then a chopper. It was insane and I have never been on a site about Ufos before and never have really thought about them but this was 100% the real thing. The m! ost insane part is when I went to the spot about 35 yards away from me where it was it was hovering over what I thought was an abandoned mine shaft. You can't even see the bottom of this shaft and it's on old government land. I have absolutely perfect video and sound of this. What do I do. Is the government going to come after me for sending it to you. I need you to see this so you can tell me what the he'll I should do.;41.0824806451613;-74.1857419354839
