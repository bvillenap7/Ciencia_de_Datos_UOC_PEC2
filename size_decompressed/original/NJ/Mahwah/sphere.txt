Perfectly round, clear/white sphere at a very high altitude moving at a very high speed;2007-07-14 17:20:00;5-7 SECONDS;Perfectly round, clear/white sphere at a very high altitude moving at a very high speed I was looking at my roofline with my wife because we wanted to see if the bees that were flying around were going under the roof shingles and making a nest. I kept looking at the area of the roofline as she went inside the garage. As I was looking my eyes caught a round, clear sphere that was up in the sky at a very high altitude and moving east at a very great speed. I moved my eyes back and forth because I thought it was a spot in my vitreous fluid within my eyeballs. The vitreous fluid sloshed back and forth with the movement of my eyes and the object I saw kept moving in one direction, so I knew it was not the fluid in my eyes. I then screamed out to my wife to see this fast moving object and she ran over but the trees were now blocking my/our view and then clouds were as well. She did not see the object, but she knew by my demeanor and the hair standing up on my whole body that I did see “something.” It was perfectly round, white or clear in :color and moved faster than anything I have ever seen. I told my wife it looked as high in the sky as when the news crews are just being able to get a clear view of the space shuttle entering the atmosphere as it is being televised for the news casts. I can also say that it looked like a bubble, like when a kid blows bubbles and they move real fast when a breeze catches them. I then got on the Internet and hoped for a posting by anyone else that may have seen it and found this sight and thank you for letting me report my sighting.;41.0824806451613;-74.1857419354839
