3 Circular UFO's seen;2009-01-21 23:00:00;5 Minutes;3 Circular UFO's seen After watching a movie, I got up as I usually do every night and went over to lock the kitchen door. As I looked out the window, I saw three (3) objects in the night sky.  I watched them for five (5) minutes moving from South to North (I was looking towards the southeast) and the objects traveled not like a plane, rather they traveled almost with no effort, very calm, smooth, very slow and no sound. The three (3) objects had a circular shape with three (3) lights on each one (the lights on each object were positioned like that of the holes of a bowling ball).  Two (2) of the lights were a very bright white color and the other was a pinkish/red color. The objects had an Amber Glow/Tint around them. If you held your hand, arms length away, the space between each object was from my thumb to my pinky.  As I was holding out my hand, if I brought it over the object to try to block it out, I could still see the Amberish glow residing around the objects.;39.638;-74.7728
