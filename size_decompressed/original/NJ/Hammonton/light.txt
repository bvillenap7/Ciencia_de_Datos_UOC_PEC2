an unusual orange/red object over hammonton nj...;2008-07-05 22:15:00;5 minutes;an unusual orange/red object over hammonton nj... my girlfriend and i, went out on the porch to have a cigarette. we both noticed a bright orange object come in from the west, and stop directly in front of us.  the object then changed color from orange to a brilliant red, and proceded to swing back and forth like a pendulum. i ran back in the house to grab my camera( a sony cybershot 6.0 mp), and by the time i got back outside it had dimmed in intensity.  at this point i could see that it was two seperate red lights, with a black bar in between them. the object then started moving off to the northeast slowly, all the while swinging back and forth, until we could no longer see it. no sound was heard coming from the object the entire time of the event, even though we were close enough to it to hear some if it was a conventional aircraft.  i tried to take several pics of it, but there was nothing to be seen after i downloaded them on my computer.;39.638;-74.7728
