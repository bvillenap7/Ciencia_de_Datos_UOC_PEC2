Continual blinking rows of lights on opposite sides of sky.;2006-10-19 19:40:00;10 minutes;Continual blinking rows of lights on opposite sides of sky. Saw strange lights in the sky last night around 7:40 PM EST.  My boyfriend points out rows of reddish/orange lights in the sky. 3 in a row on one side and 4 in a row on other side of sky. The angled rows were opposite of each other. They would come on 1 at a time and then each light in the row would come one, then go out. One side of the sky, then the next. They would go out, then one side would light up, then the other side, then off. It was freaky. They were angled at like 45 degrees. I don't know what it was. It was not a plane. It was like each side was communicating with the other. Could not see an object which was producing the lights.  Was high up in sky and appeared to be slowly moving east.  This continued for abut 10 minutes.  One side and then the next.  Off for 10 seconds, then one side and then  the next.;39.638;-74.7728
