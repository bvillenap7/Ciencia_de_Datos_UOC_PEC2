Bright light and strange sounds;2012-05-04 20:45:00;3 hrs;bright light and strange sounds Me and 4 friends were outside of the house located in bernardsville NJ when we observed strange sounds. The sounds sounded like a whistle/trumpet and varied in pitch/ volume. The length of the sound and time between sounds were consitant. There are no highways nearby and there were limited planes in the sky, but we are 100% posative it was not a plane, there are also no nearby bridges. The weather was good, it was partially cloudy and the temperature was around 65-75 degrees f.  It was also a full moon. I also observed a very bright light flash in the sky which lasted about half a second while no planes were in sight. My friends dog which was outside continuously barked into the sky as the sound was heard. after standing out side for about half an hour we went inside where the sound was still heard.  It sounded as if the sounds were constantly switching positions.  After I left my friends house   Bernardsville NJ  I went back to my own house which is located in B! asking Ridge NJ approximately 4 miles from where the sound was originally heard,  I could still hear the sounds from inside my bedroom. Also on the drive from my friends house back to mine I observed many cats and other small animals constantly running across the road which is abnormal.;40.7232;-74.5829
