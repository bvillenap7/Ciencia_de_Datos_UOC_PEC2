fireball appears over rt 287 then decends fast and diagonally behind tree line;2011-10-25 05:45:00;2-5 seconds;fireball appears over rt 287 then decends fast and diagonally behind tree line my boyfriend and I, who are both considered slightly more adept than novice astronomers in my opinion, were on our way to his place of employment driving north on Rt.287 North passing exit 35, which I believe is In the Bernardsville area.   The sky was still dark at about a quarter to six in the morning...all of a sudden a bright orange fireball that was obviously much larger than any star out that morning appeared directly in front of us (maybe a half mile up ahead) and quickly jagged down diagonally behind the tree line ahead of us...it happened very fast and lasted no longer than 5 seconds total.   We both said did you just see that? at the same time and were confused at the suddenness and odd way it moved but we both felt relieved that the other witnessed it as well.;40.7232;-74.5829
