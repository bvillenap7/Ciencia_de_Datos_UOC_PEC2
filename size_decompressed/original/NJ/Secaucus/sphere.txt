Black Sphere in Hudson County Skies;2010-08-12 14:15:00;possibly 30 seconds;Black Sphere in Hudson County Skies I was at work.  I happened to walk onto our second floor glass elevator. When I looked out I noticed a black sphere way up in the sky.  At first I thought I was seeing things but I kept staring and it wasn't moving just there in the sky.  The weather was beautiful the sky was clear no clouds but this object stood out.  I had stepped off the elevator to drop paperwork off went back to elevator within a minute and the object was gone.  I knew it wasn't a plane, or a helicopter, or a goodyear blimp.  I'm not sure what it was but I do know it was round because of the distance it appeared to be black.  The building I work in has three elevators, I was in the middle one.  The elevators have glass all around when I look out I could see the Secaucus area, the turnpike, further down open space with a view of the road and other cities.  It took place at exactly 2:15pm. Unfortunately, I didn't have my cell phone on me to take a picture of what I was seeing.;40.7876289075628;-74.059742352941
