Triangle shaped craft white lights(no blinking) slow moving pace with a green light dropped out of it low altitude heading S-SW 2:45am;2014-01-28 02:47:00;7-10 minutes;Triangle shaped craft white lights(no blinking) slow moving pace with a green light dropped out of it low altitude heading S-SW 2:45am 2 lights at first very slow near a full stop for 5 mins then slow speed past.  A third light was visible very lit background defiantly a triangle shape no sound no blinking lights no colored lights till a thin green light dropped out of the craft but didn't go to the ground, just a few inches comparable to craft size maybe several hundred feet then disappeared (the light not the craft).  The craft kept it's course going south south west until I lost a visual.  I woke my girlfriend up to see the craft before it had left our sight.  It did not replicate the green light for her but she did get to see the craft for a few mins before it passed.;39.5014;-74.8354
