Object suddenly increased in luminosity while stationary. Commutor plane passes underneath. Object rapidly moves slightly to the north and mostly upwards. Object becomes smaller and smaller until it is a barely visible dot of light higher up in sky. Within 5 seconds, from a stationary point, object became unviewable as it was lost in the dark sky above.

Round amber illuminated object flew overhead towards NYC at 12:15am on Mothers Day!;2009-05-10 00:15:00;10-15 seconds;Round amber illuminated object flew overhead towards NYC at 12:15am on Mothers Day! We were sitting in the backyard of our apartment building at 12:15am looking up at the stars when we noticed an object in the sky that wasn't normal flying east towards NYC. I noticed an object out of my peripheral vision that I thought might be a satellite. When I turned to look it was too big to be a satellite and I assumed it was a plane. However, it was flying a little lower than usual, had no blinking lights, made no sound, was round in shape with a luminescence to it, and flew faster than an airplane. The object was amber in color with a peach and orange color to it. It's trajectory was perfectly straight as it traveled above our heads. After it flew over we were mystified as to what we had witnessed and are still in disbelief. The winds seem to be heading N/NE not directly East. We have clear skies with a beautiful full moon.
