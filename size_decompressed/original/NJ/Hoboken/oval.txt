She saw a slow moving object which I didn't observe even though standing next to her.  She took pictures of this object moving from our objective left to our right (so from east to west from our perceptive of vision) she could see it and I couldn't so I asked her to take pictures. I still couldn't see the object but the camera could.  Looking at her pictures it looks like a bullet shaped object that's transparent but with color at the flying end.  What's bizarre is I didn't see the object even with her pointing until I saw the camera pictures.  I now see the glowing shape in all the pics she took but I didn't see any real time.;40.7423999999998;-74.0325
ufo submerging into water pictures;2017-05-17 13:24:00;30 seconds;ufo submerging into water pictures It wasn't too visible with the eye at the moment.  I only noticed 2 days after as I re checked my photos to post them up on facebook.  Behind me in a photo is what seems to be a ufo submerging into the Hudson River behind me.  Idk what it can be, my friends who dont believe say its a reflection from a building or the water.  I believe I caught something extraordinary and unbelievable, who knows what lies out there!;40.7423999999998;-74.0325
