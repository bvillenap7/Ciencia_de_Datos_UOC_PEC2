Stick shaped UFO moving slowly at a very high altitude North East over Northern NJ;2007-06-27 21:00:00;5 mins;Stick shaped UFO moving slowly at a very high altitude North East over Northern NJ Standing on my roof deck at dusk, I heard a strange bird sound. It's a sound I've heard before around the same time of day, so I began to look for the bird.  I think its some type of falcon, because the times I've seen it its been very high and then will dive quickly and be out of site in seconds.  I could not find the bird, but I looked North (approx) at about a 75 degree angle and saw a very visable black line with what looked like a tail.  As I observed the object I realized it wasn't moving.  Looking a little longer I realized it was moving slowly backward, but was very very high in the sky.  I then told my neighbor to look and she saw it and immediately said it was a plane as well.  Then she was surprised as well to see it was m0ving backward.  At this point I ran inside and grabbed my binoculars. Finding the object, It was clearly NOT airplane, balloon, or anything else I've heard could be spotted.  It looked like a stick, with one end, shorter and turned upwards.  It had a slight bow in the long section.  As I watched it it moved slowly North East and then dissappeared from site.  At one point it changed shape from the previously described stick, to a full half circle or bow shape.  It could have been the angle I was seeing it from.
