II was taking my dog out for a final bathroom trip and I looked to the night sky as I always do as a matter of habit when I saw 3 red lights app. 2-3 hundred feet up, traveling at a high rate of speed, and were as silent as the grave. From the ground they appeared ovular in shape and were app. 5 meters apart. Again itâ€™s very difficult to judge this distance from the ground. This was my first such experience and I just felt that I had to tell someone. The lights simply went by at a very fast clip and disappeared into the tree line.;40.0022;-74.7885000000001
