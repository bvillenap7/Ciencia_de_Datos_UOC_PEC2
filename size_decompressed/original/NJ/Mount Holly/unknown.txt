Strange motionless craft in the sky with blinking red and white lights;2016-04-12 00:30:00;30 minutes;Strange motionless craft in the sky with blinking red and white lights I was sitting in a chair around 12:30am on 4/12/2016. I heard a loud roaring noise that I thought came from the Virtua Memorial Hospital across the road from us.  I ignored it for a while and then decided to open the window and see what sort of noise it was, thinking maybe it was a compressor or generator.  The noise did not match any description that could have been made by either a compressor or generator.  It did not sound like a helicopter. I would definitely say jet engine. I decided to go downstairs and open the side door.  When I looked out I saw a large craft in the sky above our road, a little bit higher than our tallest tree in our front garden.  It was flat underneath and had blinking red and white lights.  The craft was completely motionless and did not move. It must have been there for at least half an hour.  I just stood and stared at it. The other members of my family also saw it. I called 911 and told them that there was an unusual craft in the sky and I was told it's probably a helicopter out looking for a missing person.  Firstly, there was no searchlight on the craft, and even if they were using infra-red there was no circular movement suggesting the craft was looking for anything.  Within one minute of hanging up, the craft slowly turned round and moved in the opposite direction.  The noise it made was definitely not that of a helicopter, this was a continuous roaring sound, like a jet engine, and similar to a report filed for Mt. Holly in 2013.  It was very dark so I could not see the outline of the craft but it looked flat underneath.  Over the following two days I heard and saw helicopter activity around my street, like they were looking for something.  I have no idea what this craft was. It was impressive how it simply did not move at all.;40.0022;-74.7885000000001
