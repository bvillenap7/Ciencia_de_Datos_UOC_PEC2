Multiple orange/red lights in line formation over MT. Holly/Lumberton;2013-09-14 20:15:00;15 minutes;Multiple orange/red lights in line formation over MT. Holly/Lumberton Driving northbound on RTE 541 (S. main st. Lumberton) at the intersection of 541 south main street and the bypass, we witnessed what we first thought were lights suspended on a crane of some kind.   As we turned left and traveled around the bypass in a westerly direction, we realized they (the lights) were in fact moving in a loose formation.  The lights were orange/red, no flashing markers.  The first 5-7 were in a single line formation, followed by 3 that traveled in a triangular formation.  The lights were approx 1000~2000ft, silent and traveled in a southeasterly direction from the direction of Mt. Holly.  Several other cars pulled over on the bypass to witness this event.;40.0022;-74.7885000000001
