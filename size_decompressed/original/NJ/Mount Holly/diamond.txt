We heard a loud roaring noise outside our window early this morning and couldn’t figure out what it was.  It sounded like a really loud jet engine taking off but the sounds was constant.   We listened to it for a few minutes before we decided to get up and see what it was.   I opened the bathroom window and saw two large bright rectangular red lights hovering in the sky to the north of our house.  They were completely still, like nothing we’ve ever seen.  We grabbed our binoculars and looked up at it.  The craft was close enough that we could see details. The two large rectangular red lights were the only thing visible with the naked eye. When looking through binoculars we saw that the craft was triangular with rows of smaller dimmer rectangular red lights.   It hovered in the sky completely motionless for about 30 seconds as we stood outside then it slowly started moving south at the speed of a helicopter.  When it took off, there was an outline of a circle on the top rear of it.  There were no blinking lights.   Never seen anything like this.  I have never reported anything like this, but it was too crazy not to report.  What was this?;40.0022;-74.7885000000001
