Backwards triangular formation moving from east to west, with the back point breaking off and going south.;2004-08-21 22:35:00;1-2 minutes;Backwards triangular formation moving from east to west, with the back point breaking off and going south. Seen by three people (ages 57, 28, and 21) three white objects in a triangle formation moving from west to east around or over 30,000 ft.  The formation looked like a backwards triangle with the two base points leading and the tip behind them seeming to go about as fast as a satellite.  The back light broke away from the formation about halfway through the event duration and headed south.  The other two that were leading did not change and kept on going east.  There was no sound heard.  The lights were small like stars so they could have been very high.;40.4992000000001;-74.4994792452829
