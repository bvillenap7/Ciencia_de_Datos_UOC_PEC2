Extremely bright cones shaped light shining down from the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 19:45:00;15-30 seconds;Extremely bright cones shaped light shining down from the sky. It was a clear sky with visible stars.  Witnesses a bright light shining down from the sky in a cone shape.  The light was an undescribable brightness and it appeared to sometimes almost fade and then light up extremely bright again.  A fine mist surronded the light, similar to a mist from a spray bottle.  It didn't seem smokey or cloud like.  The light at one point split into 2 like an upside down v. This light did not move, but hovered in the same exact spot.  No sounds could be heard from the light.  This took place at roughly 7:45 pm and lasted for roughly 15-30 seconds.  Eventully the light faded and went into the sky.  No vapor/smoke was left in the sky after the light was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));40.4992000000001;-74.4994792452829
Four powerful white lights circling in a circular manner.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??

Blinking Light of Short Duration & Approximately 3.0 to 3.5 Minute Period.;2012-09-12 22:20:00;Observed for 20 Minutes;Blinking Light of Short Duration & Approximately 3.0 to 3.5 Minute Period. Observed 09/12/2012 @ Approximately 2215 to 2240 Hours EDST from Central New Jersey. Observed object was a BLINKING (as opposed to FLASHING) White (Cream-White Tinted) Light which had a period of approximately THREE to THREE-and-a-HALF Minutes. Blink Duration is estimated to be about ONE-SIXTEENTH Second. No other colors were observed. The Position of the object was in the Southeastern Quadrant, at an estimated elevation of approximately 30 to 40 Degrees. The object was observed for about 20 minutes. Observation time elapsed was sufficient to see the usual change in position of the nearby stars due to the Earths rotation.  The object did NOT move in unison with the stars.  The object ALSO did NOT move in relation to an object on the ground directly below it, which was used as a reference point specifically for the purpose of observing if any movement of the object occurred. The object was also observed by another person at this time, and also observed by that same person once this past weekend. My personal opinion is that the object was a high-intensity light source located in Geo-Stationary Orbit, which would account for the lack of noticeable movement. I suspect that the purpose of the Blink and its Period is a timing function for some sort of experiment.;40.4992000000001;-74.4994792452829
