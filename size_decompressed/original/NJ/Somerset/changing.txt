It seemed to have a haze of light light around it.  That's when I noticed it was changing its shape to a line kind of like a cylinder.   I tried to zoom my phone in but the object was to far.  But if you zoom in in my pictures you can see it change shape.  Because i was in traffic i had to keep looking away for a few seconds at A TIME AND ABOUT 20 minutes later it was completely gone with no trace of the object even being there.
