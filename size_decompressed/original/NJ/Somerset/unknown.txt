I'm not completely sure if it was a ufo, however I believe it was because it was during sunset and something was being illuminated.   I was looking in the sky and I didn't think it was a plane because it was heading downward and I am positive planes don't move straight down like this object did.   It emitted a small line of smoke and it eventually blended into the sky and disappeared along with the smoke.
