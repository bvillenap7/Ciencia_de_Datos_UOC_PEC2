I saw a dull white cigar shaped UFO at 2:15 pm flying horizontal in a crystal clear blue sky.;2005-04-13 14:15:00;2 MINS.;I saw a dull white cigar shaped UFO at 2:15 pm flying horizontal in a crystal clear blue sky. Craft was cigar shaped.  The color was a non reflecting dull white. No windows or markings of any type.   The 2:15 PM sun was to my back, thus giving me a perfect view while I was sitting in my car at a traffic light.  Crystal clear blue sky with no clouds.   Craft was moving slowly left to right, west to east.  When the traffic light changed, I tried to follow the craft as my travel route was running parallel to it.  I lost sight of it behind some trees.  Seconds after sighting I saw at least three large passenger jets flying in different directions which gave me something to visually compare to.  The craft I saw did not have wings or the distinctive tail of a passenger jet.   I know that I saw a UFO.
