Consecutive slow moving silent orange objects, may have been on fire.;2014-10-03 20:00:00;5 minutes;Consecutive slow moving silent orange objects, may have been on fire. 2 very slow moving, orange flickering light sources. It looked like a flame and was flying slightly lower than an air craft.  One drifted in a straight line, then appeared to die out.  Shortly after, another followed in the exact path and also seemed to die out in the distance. It reminded me of flying lanterns, but the movement was too perfect of a pattern to be a coincidence.   Both were silent. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.9589;-74.3052
