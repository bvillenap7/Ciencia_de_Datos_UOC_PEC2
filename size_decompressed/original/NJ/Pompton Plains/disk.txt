silver craft seen near high school field .;2000-05-08 19:00:00;10 minutes;silver craft seen near high school field . saw a grayish, silver object near the mountains in our town, It didn't have any lights It seemed to change positions cause the shape changed. We took a video of it and on it we can see black dots in a circle. I think they are windows. It was somewhat of a saucer shape. My son got the best view and he said it seemed just like out of star wars. It rose in a straight line line up & then got too high for us or our camera to see. It was about 1 hr. before a storm. It was the day before mothers day,about 7pm. On the film you can see it reflecting the sun on one side. my backyard is a high school field & the sun was reflecting the lights on the football field too. On frame on the video it seems to be rotating. no one else had seen it. I spoke to the police dept. but nothing was reported.It was in Pompton Plains N.J. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested a copy of the video, or stills.  PD));40.9589;-74.3052
