Two orange fireballs silently glided overhead seperately;2014-10-02 20:15:00;3-4 minutes;two orange fireballs silently glided overhead seperately I saw a round orange fireball silently glide across the sky and then disappear.  Then about 1 minute later a second round orange fireball following the same path as the first one silently glide across the sky.  The second one disappeared into a cloud.  Neither object blinked or flashed but just stayed solid in color.  The sky was dark, but planes were flying at a much higher level in the sky, but not close.;40.9589;-74.3052
