Green-white round light with streak behind in south east sky over airport;2012-04-12 20:00:00;2 seconds;Green-white round light with streak behind in south east sky over airport At Lakewood airport between 20:00 and 20:30 a bright streak of green white light streaked across the south east sky at high speed for about 2 seconds. The leading edge was round and the rest tapered back to a point with a length of about 4 diameters of the circular portion. The light disappeared into a cloud and was not seen again.  Typical aircraft in the vicinity of the area are slow moving 1-2 proppeller planes, helicopters or large military aircraft.  This did not match the profile of any of those. I would estimate the speed of the object at 3-7 times the speed of a small private plane. There was no sound associated with the object.

They did not look like planes nor helicopters.  There was no sound either.  I called my family to see and then 3 more came when the previous vanished in the sky.  After 10 minutes again we saw just one more and then it stopped.;40.0881;-74.1962999999998
