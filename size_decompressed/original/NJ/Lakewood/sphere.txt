No one else remembered leaving for the entire day.;1982-07-01 08:30:00;13 hours;No one else remembered leaving for the entire day. The sphere came down almost close enough to touch it as we waited time to go to recreation at about 8:30 that morning.  My girlfriend said, I' going to get my camera.  By the time she turned around it was about 9:00 pm.   The stars were out.  No one else remembered except a neighbor who stated that she saw the craft come down, the saw everyone standing quietly, dazed and going home.   I was excited and talking frantically.  No one else remembered.  They kept coming back. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));40.0881;-74.1962999999998
