THAT WAS ODD AND A FIRST FOR US. THEN BEFORE 10PM WE NOTICED A TRAIL OF CLOUDS OR EXHAUST THAT LOOKED LIKE WHITE STAIRS. WE HAD BEEN WALKING AND I POINTED THAT OUT ALSO. THE FOLLOWING NIGHT I WAS WATCHING TV, MY GIRLFRIEND ASLEEP, AND MY UNCLE EATING, WHEN SOMETHING TOLD ME TO GET UP AND OPEN THE SHADE. I DID IT WITHOUT HESITAION AND I SAW A VERY BRIGHT WHITE-YELLOWISH ELIPTICAL CRAFT HOVERING OVER SOME POWER LINES. I WOKE MY GIRLFRIEND UP AND GOT MY UNCLE OUTSIDE TO VIEW THIS OBJECT. THEY WERE SHOCKED AND IN AWE. PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE LAKEWOOD SHOP RITE OBSERVED IT TOO. BEING THE LEO THAT I AM, I WENT OUTSIDE TO FOLLOW IT. IT MOVED SLOWLY WITH STRANGE LIGHTS DESCENDING FROM IT LIKE DROPPING FROM THE SHIP AND COMING BACK. MY DOWNSTAIRS NEIGHBOR CARLOS SAW IT TOO. SO I WENT OUT AND FOLLOWED IT FROM A FAR DISTANCE AS IT CONTINUED EAST OVER THE COUNTY LINE AREA, ANOTHER ODD THING WAS THERE WAS A LADY SITTING ON THE CURB SIDE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE APARTMENT COMPLEX, WITH A JEAN JACKET AND JEAN PANTS ON. I COULDN'T MAKE OUT HER FEATURES BUT IT WAS ODD FOR ANYONE TO BE OVER DRESSED AROUND 130 AM IN AUGUST. IT DIDN'T LOOK RIGHT. MY UNCLE THOUGHT THE UFO HAD TAKEN ME UNTIL THEY MET UP WITH ME ABOUT 10-15 MINUTES LATER. I CALLED THE LAKEWOOD POLICE DEPT. AND THE DISPATCHER REPORTED OTHER OFFICERS SEEING IT, I THEN CALLED THE MUFON NUMBER AND MY PHONE CALL WAS BLOCKED. AS I WENT OUT TO WORK THAT MONDAY THERE WAS A RED BLIMP THAT SAID GOLDEN ON IT BUT THAT WASN'T WHAT WE SAW,THE BLIMP WAS OUT BY THE LAKEWOOD AIRPORT. ANOTHER ODDITY IS THE BIRTH OF MY SON ON AUGUST 16TH THE FOLLOWING YEAR. WE HAD BEEN TOGETHER SINCE 1987 AND HAD NO KIDS TOGETHER OR SEPARTELY.;40.0881;-74.1962999999998
Saucer craft altitude 50+ feet going at 10+mph passed over apartment building;2000-09-15 01:30:00;2 Minute;Saucer craft altitude 50+ feet going at 10+mph passed over apartment building I was sitting on my back portch on the second floor of a two story apartment building. I was contemplating life before I went to bed. I heard a noise that sounded like a plain at cruising altitude high in the sky. I turned my head up to the right and saw a light then I looked back down as my first impression was plain in the sky no big deal. After a second or two once my mind re-analyzed the image my head spun around and looked back with my mind already racing. Low and behold there was a saucer shaped craft that was about 30 to 50 feet in diameter and maybe 20 feet high hovering along at about 10 to 15 miles per hour. The altitude was very low maybe 50 to 100 feet. I remember looking at the tree in the yard and thinking it was about double the hight of the tree. The tree was a little higher than the building was a typical two storry aprtment building with a low slopping roof. I think it was about 30 feet hight or so. I just started at it very closely trying to make out the details on the body of it. I remember creases in the exterior where doors could have been. It had lights on top which I think where blue and/or red and it had three white lights on the bottom which formed a triangle. The lights on the bottom where pretty big but I don't remember them being very bright but I could be wrong about this. I was trying to concentrate on the details of the exterior which I could see because I was so close. It entered to the right of my balcony and flew across the back yard of the building and crossed over the top to my left. The building is in an L shape at about 45 degrees. So it passed over the back of the building which is the acute angle side of the building. As soon as it passed from view I ran inside and grabbed my video camera which was sitting on the cough (very cool) I ran outside and downstair out the front of the building and into the parking lot. By this time it was about 200 feet away heading away from me at the same speed, 10 to 15 mph I would estimate maybe slower. I was scrambling to get the video camera on the right setting and powered on and zoomed into the object and at the same time trying to see the object with my other eye so I didn't miss anything. Well by the time I got the video camera working it was to far away. It looked like a street light from a few hundred feet away. I had a really good zoom so I was zooming in way to far. Well you get the idea I didn't manager to get it on tape. The object made a low rumbling noise which was pretty quiet. Like I said it sounded like a jet at very high altitude at first. I did not see any exterial signs of propulsion. There was no smoke or trail of any kind and I did not smell anything either. I definitely had some type of vertical thrust acting on it because it was going so slow and it was saucer shaped. Right after the incident I went inside and spent the next 4 hours researching on the internet. I found pictures of UFO's on the internet that looked very similar to what I saw. I reported this incident that night to http://www.aliens111.com. I got an email back from them a few day later asking to put my report on their web site. I told them that was fine just leave my name off. I just emailed them again to see if they could dig up my report because it could contain details that I have forgotten or maybe identify some inconsitancies with this report I am filing now, which is my current memory of events. Thanks for listening and keep up the great work. I became aware of your web site from Jeff Rense. I was listening to his radio and heard you call for more reports so I figured I would take the time to send you mine...:-) ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed a blimp, but that is only a guess.  Date is approximate.  PD));40.0881;-74.1962999999998
