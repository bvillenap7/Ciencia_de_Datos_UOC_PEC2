Driving home at a high point in town, Hillside Avenue, and saw an aircraft flying several yards over a 2 story house on the right side of the road.  I saw it fly very slowly from my right, cross over the road, and fly to the left and onward, in the direction of East toward downtown and Sayreville. It was smoothly flying no more than 25 MPH very low to the ground.  I saw a slight shadow of the outline of the aircraft and it appeared to be disk shaped with red, white, and blue (do not remember the order of the colors) lights stacked on top of each other at each end of the aircraft that did NOT blink at all, unlike every other aircraft I have seen in the sky.   It was definitely not a plane nor helicopter.  It was unlike anything I have ever seen before.;40.4405090909091;-74.3836090909091
