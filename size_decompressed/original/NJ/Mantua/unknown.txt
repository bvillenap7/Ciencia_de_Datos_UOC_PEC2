Strange red/white/red blinking light in Southern New Jersey.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of Sirius in the southern sky?  PD));2009-02-02 01:00:00;one hour as of now...;Strange red/white/red blinking light in Southern New Jersey This is being seen currently at Electric Mobility National Headquaters located in Southern New Jersey.  The company the four of us work for is an ovenight call center in the first floor of the building.  At approx. 1:40 am I was outside smoking a cigarette.There are a few achers of woods to the rear of the campass that our parking lot faces, so i typically am facing these woods when i smoke.  It is a very clear night!  I saw a light that is obviously very far away, becuase it looks like a dot.  It was MUCH TOO LOW AND BLINKIE to be a star or a plane.  It never moved.   An hour later, my friend Carol who works with me went out to smoke, and came inside to ask me to see something.  She was seeing the same thing i saw earlier, and it was still in the same spot, blinking red and greenish..and would flash red every so often. We then called our manager, Brenda outside, and she witnissed this, too.  It hovered in the same spot the entire time we were watching.  Another co worker arrived at work, and she saw it also. I plan to go outisde in another hour to see what it is doing. We all agree that it is absoutly NOT a plane, star, or planet.   We work nigts EVERY NIGHT, and are accustumed to the stars in the sky, and what planes look like. Please let us know if anyone in the south jersey area has seen this tonight!   We're very excited!  Thank you. ((names deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of Sirius in the southern sky?  PD));39.7875;-75.1797
