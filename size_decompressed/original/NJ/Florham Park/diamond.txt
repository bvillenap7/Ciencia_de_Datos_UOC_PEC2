Orange diamond kite like object spotted over NJ.;2014-04-17 20:00:00;2 minutes;Orange diamond kite like object spotted over NJ. I was playing in the yard when my son told me to look up in the sky.  He said that there was a shooting star falling out of the sky.  I took a look up in the south east direction from my Florham Park yard. I initially saw what looked like plane, as it was the most logical thought.  Note that I do live near Morristown Airport, so I just assumed it was a low flying plane.  But it wasnâ€™t flying like a plane.  It was moving a slower and there was a change of speeds.  It seemed to be flying at a steady pace at first, but then slowed down and with that change of pace was a slight change in direction.  Seemed odd to me.  This is when I thought it was more than a plane. After it flew for what seemed like  a minute, I had a hard time making it out and seemed to have disappeared from my view.   In regards to the object itself, I would say it was just 1 color.  It was an orange color of lights.  It appeared to be diamond shaped.  I even said to myself that it looks like a kite with lights around it. In what might be a coincidence, after the object went out of view, there was a plane that seemed to be flying in that same direction.   My thought on that was it saw what I saw and was going to take a closer look.;40.7701;-74.385
