There was a white flickering light (at the rate of about 3 flickers per second) and a red light.  It came to a lower point in the arc, close to the ocean and stopped, as the white light went off.   Then the red light slowly lowered itself towards the ocean surface.  I could see the horizon in the dark and the light was lower than the horizon.  I was about 8 feet above sea level and stand 6 feet tall, so the light was much lower than 14 feet about the surface.   The red light went on and off a few times and finally disappeared.  I waited there for about 2 minutes but it did not come reappear.  No sounds were heard and the path seemed to perfectly graceful to be a helicopter like object.;40.247;-74.0044
