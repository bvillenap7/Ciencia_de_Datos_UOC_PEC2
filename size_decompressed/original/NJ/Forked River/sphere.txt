Spherical white object flying at high rate of speed southwest while driving on Parkway in Forked River, NJ.;2019-01-09 06:45:00;10-15 seconds;Spherical white object flying at high rate of speed southwest while driving on Parkway in Forked River NJ I was driving to work, southbound on the Garden State Parkway, at approximately 6:45am, between Toms River and Forked River. I saw a spherical white object coming down, or so I thought, initially I thought it was falling, but the longer I looked, which admittedly wasn't very long, I realized the object wasn't falling, it was flying at high rate of speed south or southwest,and then it was just gone.  When I say gone I don't mean it disappeared, I mean it just flew that fast out of sight. I'm very familiar with planes and helicopters in my sky, I grew up very close to LaGuardia airport,  I currently live in the vicinity of Macquire Fort Dix joint base in Lakehurst, and most recently I had a fighter jet pass over my apartment earlier last year when it was scrambled to President Trump's NJ golf club, so planes and other man made objects I'm familiar with.  I've seen meteorites, as I tried to explain to myself what I had just seen, I wrote that off because there was no tail trailing.  If it was a jet fighter, at the speed I saw this thing moving, it would have probably created a boom, and I don't believe they're allowed to fly that fast in residential areas.  There were also no flashing red or blue lights.;39.8451;-74.2021
