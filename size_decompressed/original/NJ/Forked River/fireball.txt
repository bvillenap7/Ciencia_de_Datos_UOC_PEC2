Perfect flight pattern. 5 min apart. Over the bay. Slow moving, void of sound, looked like a balloon with a candle inside. 4 in total over approx 20 min. 5 minutes apart in a flight pattern. My husband and I were sailing out of the Forked River and entering into Barnaget Bay. To the right of us at the mouth of the bay we saw what looked like the flare of a firework but much slower and heading North across the bay towards Toms River. It came from over the houses off Beach Blvd in Forked River, NJ. From the direction of Oyster Creek. We stopped the boat and watch the object slowly fly over our heads - ascending as it flew North. It did look like an orange fire ball.  I would describe it as a balloon with a candle in it. The light flickered as a flame would, orange as a flame. As  we stood to figure it out - we saw another one come from the same direction.  Exact same thing, same flight pattern. No sound. It too flew right over our heads as it moved higher into the sky heading North. Two more followed.  We waited another half hour but that was it. 4 objects.  Same flight pattern.  Starting low to the South of us -  looked like the start of a firework. Flew right over us heading north while ascending high into the sky until it just disappeared - all 4 of them.  We took videos but you only see a the fireball moving - and no sound. My husband is retired USAF.  He has been around all types of aircraft.  He said he has never seen anything like that - move like that - so low and still no sound.  He said he has been able to ID a UFO in his past 30 years...this is the first time he said he can really say it was a UFO (which he never believed in.  Until last night).;39.8451;-74.2021
