2 Triangle shaped objects hovering in pine Barrens on Lacey Road Forked river NJ;2007-09-15 23:10:00;5 -10 min;2 Triangle shaped objects hovering in pine Barrens on Lacey Road Forked river NJ I was returning home from work driving lacey rd,a remote stretch of road in the pine barrens.It was approximately 11:15,11:20 pm on Saturday nite 09/15. I was chatting on my cell to a friend when I saw 2 very bright flying objects flying side by side,what seemed like very low (too low for most planes),just ahead and to the right of my car.I was traveling towards the rt 74 exit of the parkway, maybe 6 or 7 minutes away from there.At first i thought they must be some sort of police helicopter or EMT helicopter but as I got closer i realized they were triangle shape.They had 2 very bright Blue lights on the side and a red light on the back. Needless to say,I told my friend I would call her back.As I got closer ,I noticed they were very close together and then one changed and hovered above the other. They were moving very slowly,the lights were VERY bright on them.I had another driver on my tail so I slowed down and pulled to my right.When I looked up they had disapeared into cloud cover.We are close to Fort Dix so this has to be a weird Army thing right?.Maybe their testing something new?;39.8451;-74.2021
Triangle shaped object in the sky at 1:48am with blinking lights, flies straight up into the sky;2012-06-23 01:00:00;1 hour;Triangle shaped object in the sky at 1:48am with blinking lights, flies straight up into the sky The triangle shaped object was in the sky at a tilted angle,with white lights blinking on the bottom side of the object.  There was a giant black and grey cloud to the right side of it,and a white cloud came out of the space ship.  At that point I flashed  a flashlight toward the object.  The white cloud retreated into or behind the object, and the object then shot straight up into the sky.;39.8451;-74.2021
