Triangular shapes objects hovering;1986-06-01 10:00:00;1 hour;Triangular shapes objects hovering This was in 1986.  It was so long ago, but I never knew you could report it.  There were other times and they were different than this.  My sister an d8 were driving back from the supermarket in Jackson NJ.  As we were coming home, I noticed an object in the sky moving and there were 3.  It looked like it was following us.   We got home and the 3 objects stopped moving.  They sat high up in the sky for a long time.  They were triangular shaped and they sat far apart, but in a triangular formation.  They had lights on them.  If you could draw in the sky and connect the dots, you could make a triangle.  We watched them and were freaked out.   Then they started moving after maybe 20 minutes to a half hour.  It was so long ago, Iâ€™m not sure.  They then moved at the same time and made another triangle formation. It was so creepy, because how can something just hover in the sky.  How can something just sit in the sky.  Anyway, it took about an hour or so totally  leave the area.;40.2458999999999;-74.2812999999999
Flying then disappeared in to sky;2007-11-02 07:00:00;20 sec.;Flying then disappeared in to sky At 7:00 it was a clear, sunny day, I looked at the northern horizon I saw a triangle shaped object that was heading south. The object was flying around 300yds. It was a 3-D triangle with two lights on each side. It kept on moving until it whet behind my house. I moved over so my house will not be in my way. It could not see the object any more. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.2458999999999;-74.2812999999999
Triangular aircraft with white lights and a blinking red light at triangles core;2015-07-21 00:17:00;20 seconds;Triangular aircraft with white lights and a blinking red light at triangles core Walking dog, heard a noise and white light coming over the trees.  Looked up thinking there was a very low flying plane.   Once the aircraft emerged fully from the tree line, I noticed that this was no airplane or aircraft that I have ever seen before.  Aircraft was massive in size but was moving pretty slow.  It was pretty loud as well.  It was a perfect triangle with white lights at each corner and a red flashing light in the middle.;40.2458999999999;-74.2812999999999
