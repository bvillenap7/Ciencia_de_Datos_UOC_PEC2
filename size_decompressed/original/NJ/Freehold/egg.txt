UFO spotted over Freehold, New Jersey.;2010-08-14 21:45:00;:06-:08;UFO spotted over Freehold, New Jersey. On the night of Saturday, August 14th, two friends of mine and I believe we witnessed a UFO.  The first sighting happened at around 9:45pm.   Two of us witnessed an oval or egg shaped cluster of about 5 to six bright blue lights one of them was green.  In a matter of about six to seven seconds it moved in a circular motion.. twice, then zipped off into the dark sky.  It appeared to be about four miled away from us to the North.  We were facing North.   My third friend came out to the backyard as we were discussing this.  This is when the object appeared again.. for about 8-9 seconds this time.  The very same object.  This time, it made two circles again, hovered in place for about 3 seconds, then again flashed off into the night.   Then it was gone and did not reappear.;40.2458999999999;-74.2812999999999
