On Sunday, March 9th at 12:30pm, on a very clear afternoon, my husband and I were driving home from church, when we both noticed a flashy object in the sky.  At first, we thought that it was a helium mylar balloon.   Only after watching it for several seconds, were we able to tell, that it wasn't a balloon.  First, the object was hovering, not moving in any direction second, the texture was too bright and shiny, like liquid silver, and finally, the shape was too precise to be a balloon.  It was oval in shape, but it seemed to be smaller on top than on the bottom.  From the angle that we were looking at it, the shape was similar to a kidney bean. We looked at each other and then looked back into the sky, and it was gone.  We are convinced, without a doubt, that what we saw was a UFO.  Both of us are college educated he works for one of the largest consultant firms in the country and I am attending college pursuing a  2nd degree in Christian Counseling.;40.2458999999999;-74.2812999999999
