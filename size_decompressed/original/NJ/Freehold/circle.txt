What else could it have been?;2004-05-10 22:40:00;30 SECONDS;What else could it have been? There was four of us on the porch just enjoying the night, my boyfriend saw it first and jokingly said  Look a UFO so we all looked up and realized omg what else could it be. First of all it was a circle and it was orange it wasnt moving steadily it was kind of wobbling like a frisbe would if you threw it but It stayed in the air much longer than that and instead of coming down like a frisbee would it simply vanished into the clouds about 2 minutes later the second one appeared. This one seemed to be flying sideways and it to dissapeared within seconds.;40.2458999999999;-74.2812999999999
Hovering light object underneath Orion's Belt.;2014-01-19 19:30:00;7 minutes;Hovering light object underneath Orion's Belt. Was looking at Orion's Belt and noticed a star beneath it with flickering lights.  We thought it was a plane at first.  But then we noticed an actual plane flying above it and noticed the star was just hovering.   As we were watching it slowly started moving in a zig zag formation as it lowered itself closer to Earth.  A few more minutes go by and we notice the object begins to move side to side as it starts to go up a little higher.   A few more minutes go by and we see it rising higher and higher in a side to side way.   After about 7 minutes we had to finally leave.;40.2458999999999;-74.2812999999999
Bright round object moving in a perfectly straight line broke off into 4 circulars objects all the same size and disappeared behind tre;2017-11-24 18:00:00;10 seconds;Bright round object moving in a perfectly straight line broke off into 4 circulars objects all the same size and disappeared behind tre As I was driving down route 9 near the freehold mall, I saw something in the sky that caught my eye because it was bright and moving very fast in a perfectly horizontal line. It went from one end of the sky to the other and broke off into 4 perfectly round objects, all the same exact size and then they swooped down behind trees and disappeared.   I have seen shooting stars before and none lasted this long nor were they travelling such a perfectly straight line! I went online the same day to see others were posting about the same exact thing I saw so I know there had to be many witnesses.;40.2458999999999;-74.2812999999999
