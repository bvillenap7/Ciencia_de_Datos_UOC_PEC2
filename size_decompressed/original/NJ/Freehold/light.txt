Strange Orange Light;1997-07-01 00:00:00;5 seconds;Strange Orange Light Well, this is different that all the other stories i've read here.  This was really bizzare.  I was on East Freehold Rd, in Freehold, NJ near Rt 79.  I was on a part of the road at that time which was only woods.  No homes or anything.  I was going maybe 30 MPH and all the sudden me and my friend ((name deleted)) (from manalapan) saw a small orange light float right in front of my car, and then SPED off REALLY fast to the right of my car, into the WOODS.  THe light was small, maybe the size of a human finger.  We both saw it, and we were both sober and very much awake.  I no longer talk to my friend but this is something i will never forget.  Could there be UFO's that small with small creatures inside?  who knows. Oh no sound at all with the light. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.2458999999999;-74.2812999999999
A bright light that hoover motionless eventually ascended straight up;2006-08-22 20:05:00;5 minutes;A bright light that hoover motionless eventually ascended straight up Saw what appeared to be a VERY bright star motionless in the sky. I was intriqued by the brightness of it. It started to ascend straight up very slowly, at which point I called over the other witnesses.

If Orion had a foot, there is a star-like object making moves aerodynamically impossible.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius sighting.  PD));2006-12-17 22:00:00;2-3 Hours;If Orion had a foot, there is a star-like object making moves aerodynamically impossible. Looking at Orion's belt towards the Eastern night sky, and imagining if Orion had a foot, for the last two nights at the spot where Orion's foot would be I've seen a bright star moving in impossible moves. Backwards, forwards, sideways, stationary, shooting towards a spot, stopping, then moving all around and then actually seeming to twirl in a circle! I saw it last night at the same spot and it's still there now! I positioned myself in a stationary spot against a wall to make sure my body movements were not causing what could give the illusion of it moving and it still was doing all the above stated manuevers. I called two other people and they both confirmed what I was seeing. Then another person joined one of my other witnesses outside while we were talking on the phone and they said they saw this object doing what we both were seeing simultaneously as we talked. I don't care if anyone believes this as I and three other people saw it too. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius is below, and to the left, of the bottom of the constellation, Orion.

Strange light over Freehold, NJ;2009-09-18 20:30:00;20 seconds;Strange light over Freehold, NJ During a conversation, 6 people were attracted toward the darkened, completely clear sky... stars were visible, no cloud cover at all during the day, or the evening. A light which appeared in the southern sky, became brighter during the first 5-7 seconds shone down in a triangular pattern, and appeared to have a smoke screen/cloud surrounding it, which seemed odd because of the otherwise clear evening. All six people were shocked and startled by the view, which could only be explained by it's close proximity, and altitude (and hovering) to be a helicopter, except it was completely quiet. As soon as the light reached it brightest, and many of us were worried, it appeared to depart in an upward pattern (straight up and away) it took about 5-7 seconds to diminish and then disappear. No one who witnessed this event (including one military vet, and current law enforcement officer) had ever seen anything like this before.;40.2458999999999;-74.2812999999999
Earthbound object.;2014-10-17 00:38:00;2 seconds;Earthbound object. At about 12:38 in the morning I was on route 9 north going home when I saw a light shoot from the sky through the clouds heading earthbound.  It went by very quickly but there was no tell on the end which makes me think it wasn't a meteor or comet.  It was really neat to see and have waited all my life to see something like that.  I know it wasn't a shooting star because it wasn't streaming across the sky it was heading inbound to the ground.  There was no sound.  It was a mile or two at best away from me. It was very bright.  The speed in which it came down was incredible.  I've never seen anything move that fast.  My radio started to get all static like as it happened.  It was so amazing.  I've waited all my life to see something and I finally did.  I hope I see it again.;40.2458999999999;-74.2812999999999

Looking east because because it was my best view on a stary night I sky watched as I slowly smoked my cigarette.  Not really a sky nut where I know where every star is located, but not uninformed either  Finished my cigarette and turned and walked to the house.  As I was walking to the door I looked up and noticed orions belt.  Stopped dead in my tracks because I was just skywatching orions belt dead east.  Walked back into the yard to look and there was orions belt.  I stood there and ask myself why there is two belts and just then what I originally thought was the belt started to tilt and them started to move.  I put my phone on video and started to film but didn't think it would pick it up.  I ran inside to wake my brother for an eyewitness and then continued to film not knowing my phone actually filmed it.  Well to say the least next time I will stick to the phone because what i did capture was good video and I'm disappointed cause I could have captured the whole event.;40.2458999999999;-74.2812999999999
7 glowing orange  spheres moving slowly.;2019-02-23 23:40:00;3 minutes;7 glowing orange  spheres moving slowly. From my bed I could see 7 orange balls of light moving slowly from south to northwest at around 11:40PM on 2/23/19.   I got up and opened the window and continued to watch the lights move slowly for another 2 minutes or so.  There were 2 groups of 3 and a single one that was trailing behind.   After that they seemed to disappear into the cloud cover.;40.2458999999999;-74.2812999999999
