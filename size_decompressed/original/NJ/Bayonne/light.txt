The object stopped and then we noticed one about a mile away come to a complete stop like either they were connected or just stopped short in Newark bay.  They then made a manever north and then disappeared. there was no sound at all and they moved like a very fast low plane but were too fast and came to a complete stop before getting into Newark Airport airspace.  They had seemed to stop and observe the lights from Port Newark and then take off at high speed with no sound. 15 minutes later we seen another alone and it was brither then the other two and made the same manuevver and took off quickly to the north over the bay.
