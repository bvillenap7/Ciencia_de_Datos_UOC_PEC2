With the trajectory of a satellite, a single, silent inverted orange flame passed overhead from northeast to southwest.;2012-11-22 00:50:00;8 minutes;With the trajectory of a satellite, a single, silent inverted orange flame passed overhead from northeast to southwest. On November 22, 2012, at 00:50 EST, traveling in a very steady, precise trajectory from north-east to south-west — moving not unlike a satellite — a small steady orange flame which appeared to be flickering, licking when seen through binoculars, passed overhead from horizon to horizon. Distant buildings had obscured its initial approach and final departure but its straight-line path was unmistakable and significant. Its duration was at least 4 minutes. Noteworthy: Neither white spotlights nor red & green running lights were evident, and no sound was could be associated with it — it’s a dense, active city where I was when I saw it. As this was my second sighting of possibly same or similar craft in perhaps 3 days (at possibly 22:50 EST on perhaps 11/19/12), it seems it could be a recurring phenomenon.  I had no other impression of it other than it was manmade and quite peculiar.  The quite bizarre part is that the flame would have had to be upside down since the flame was never obscured and appeared to project downward the entire time.  I would liken it to an upside down barbeque grill with lighter fluid freshly lit.  It was bright and clear even as it approached the south-eastern horizon.;40.6679;-74.1178
