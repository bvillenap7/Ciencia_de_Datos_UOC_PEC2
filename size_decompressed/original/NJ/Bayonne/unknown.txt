Bright Light Over New Jersey;2001-01-21 21:00:00;30 min;Bright Light Over New Jersey On the night of Jan. 21, 2001, I was on the Staten Island Ferry to Manhattan. From the window I noticed a bright, white light low in the sky over New Jersey. I went to the rear deck of the boat to get a better look. It appeared to be brighter than any planet I've ever seen in the night sky, and too low on the horizon to be a planet of such brightness. I got to the Manhattan side, and noticed the light had moved North and was now somewhere near Newark. It then changed in color to bright red, pulsed periodically, and moved Westward eventually fading. I returned the next nigh, at the same time, to the same vantage point at Battery Park, and It was clear it was not any planet, as there was nothing in that part of the sky and at the time and the weather was quite clear. Anyone else see this?  ((URL deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We think there is a possibility the witness may have been observing a planet or a twinkling star.  However, our theory is wrong if in fact the object moved as described.  PD));40.6679;-74.1178
