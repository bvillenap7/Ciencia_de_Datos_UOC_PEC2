I saw something flying that I just can't explain!;2004-02-11 16:00:00;2 minutes;I saw something flying that I just can't explain! On or about the date entered above,my friend and I saw something strange in the southern sky.We were returning home from work ,driving into my home town when I noticed a peculiar object trailing what I believe was a high flying jet.The jet was not alone.Flying with it at about the same altitude were four other jets.This in itself was not strange to me since we're surrounded by three large airports.What was strange though was the small orb like object flying behind one of the planes.I observed this for about about 30 seconds before asking my friend what the hell is that.He didn't see what I was looking at at first,but after I gave him a clearer picture of where I was looking ,he saw it too.As I said earlier this thing was orb like ,about10 feet in circumfrence .It was shiny but not brilliant.It flew behind beside,above and in front of this one jet.As this was occurring we noticed that the four other planes had suddenly veered away.Looking back to the original plane watched this thing do more of the same acrobatics and bolt away.Needless to say we were both dumdfounded by what we had just witnessed.We told a few friends about it but they weren't too believing.The event faded ,untill recently that is.While surfing the net I came upon some footage which was eerily familiar.It showed the same orblike object my friend and I had seen!It blew me away and when I showed the video to my friend he was flabbergasted.We agreed that it was in fact exactly like what we had both seen months before.My story is more complicated then what I've put down here,if I told my whole story the boys in the white coats would come and get me.

The objects remained immobile but very radiant, and the mi! lky clou ds happened once more, and then around 5 in the morning one of the closest and largest objects with very radiant lights descended a little and moved a couple of times from right to left and so vice versa until all the objects lined up again and went the way they arrived I don't know if they are government drones or UFOs? But I was afraid, it felt like a galactic invasion, I felt very minimized and angry, please, what was this? I have videos and a photo;40.6679;-74.1178
