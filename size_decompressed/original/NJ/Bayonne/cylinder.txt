((anonymous report));2016-10-27 21:30:00;2-4 seconds;Cylinder type of object hovering on top of the water with bright light beams. While driving on 440 RT south, the light illuminated the entire sky for about 2-3 seconds before shutting off.  The object appeared to be of cylindrical shape, the light was emitting from its center and the lights were very strong. At first, I thought it was lightning, but the source of the light was coming from the object itself. After 2-3 seconds, it shut off.  And then reappeared within 5 seconds for another 2-3.  Did not see the light after that.  All of this took place between the Stop & Shop area and Port Terminal Blvd. Lat/Lon: 40.6678177,-74.1049185 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
