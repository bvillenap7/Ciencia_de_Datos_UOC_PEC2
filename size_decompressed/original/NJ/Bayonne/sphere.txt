Orange orb over Bayonne, NJ.;2013-06-01 21:00:00;30 seconds;orange orb over Bayonne, nj. Was at a friends house on 16th street between Broadway and Kennedy blvd.  As we sat outside I noticed an orange orb rise into the east sky.  I called attention to it and others saw it as well.  It flew near an aircraft and did a circle around it.  Then proceeded at high speed to the west.  It never blinked or made any noise what so ever.  It was very bright and reminded me of the tip of a lit cigarette against the night sky, a perfect circle glowing bright orange.  It flew west behind some tree cover and as it almost left our field of vision, it instantly turned bright red and then faded away like some one turned the light off.  Due to its incredible speed and that my friends saw it as well, i believe it to be a ufo.  I've never seen anything like this before in my life;40.6679;-74.1178
High altitude drifting and stopping white dot against blue sky strobes briefly before disappearing from soght;2018-07-07 14:36:00;10-15 minutes;High altitude drifting and stopping white dot against blue sky strobes briefly before disappearing from soght Standing on my mother's deck in Bayonne New Jersey saw a white dot of a light in the sky.  At first it was stationary then it drifted to my left stopped became stationary again and drifted again.  As a point of reference an airplane went by in the same direction and blue sky.  In proximity of Newark airport but I grew up in this house my whole life and this was definitely not an airplane   It drifted in a southerly direction.;40.6679;-74.1178
