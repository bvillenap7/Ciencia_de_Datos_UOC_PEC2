Green object on memorial day in the NJ skies;2005-05-30 13:00:00;2 minutes;Green object on memorial day in the NJ skies It was around 1:30 PM, while sitting in my back yard under a clear beautiful blue sky on Memorial Day afternoon, my sister in-law and my husband called me outside to see what looked to be a round shaped, almost  neon green  colored object that changed shape from round to oval in about a minute and dissapeared into the clouds. I was just wondering if there were other reports around my neighborhood at the same time.;40.6679;-74.1178
