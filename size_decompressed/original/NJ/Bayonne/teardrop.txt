It flew what seemed to be a lot lower than the stars in the sky, almost the height of a helicopter, or plane, it left a bit of a trail behind it.  It definitely wasn't a shooting star but but bigger, brighter, and lower flying.  It seemed to be no more than 100-300feet from when it started to when it ended and lasted 1-2 seconds.  I definitely saw it clear as day. I have perfect eye sight and am not under the influence of drugs or alcohol where I thought I saw something that didn't really exist.  It was circular or oval in shape and moved quick where it left a trail of light behind it that was similar to a tear drop.
