Rapidly-approaching, brightly-lit craft disappears over Kill Van Kull;2012-08-03 16:00:00;15 seconds;Rapidly-approaching, brightly-lit craft disappears over Kill Van Kull At the above time and date, I was standing on the shore of the Kill Van Kull in Bayonne, approximately 1/2 mile north of the Bayonne Bridge.  I was looking out over the water when I saw what I thought was a low-flying helicopter rapidly approaching me from the Staten Island side of the Kill.  I watched for a few seconds, getting confused as I was not seeing a helicopter or plane shape under a very bright, white light on top.  It was indistinct and dark, with an oval profile.   As I waited for it to pass overhead I was distracted for all of three seconds, as my dog got twisted up in his leash. I bent down to untangle him, stood back up and looked expectantly overhead to see this strange copter but there was no longer anything in the air overhead.  From my vantage point I had an excellent, unobstructed view of all directions around me, and that craft was nowhere to be found, nor was there any noise emanating from it whatsoever. I remember that the light was so much brighter than what one would normally see on an aircraft, and for the life of me cannot figure out exactly what I saw, or what transpired that day.;40.6679;-74.1178

A low gliding ship, rotating, with red and white flickering lights, it was a circle with a bubble hump in the top center.  It passed in the direction of NYC, moving towards there.  No sound.  The lights got my attention.;40.6679;-74.1178
