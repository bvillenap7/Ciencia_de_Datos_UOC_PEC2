Red star like object in the sky moving around in the sky;2011-07-03 23:00:00;3 minutes;Red star like object in the sky moving around in the sky On July 3, 2011, I spotted a red star like object in the sky.   At first, I believed this object to be an airplane but soon realized it was not.  The object moved through the sky going forward but left to right and then in circles.  This went on for a matter of 3 minutes and then the object I believe to be a ufo disappeared into thin air.
