suspicious   moving lights no sounds  in the sky   to close to the ground;2004-01-29 21:30:00;3 minutes;suspicious   moving lights no sounds  in the sky   to close to the ground in my way home we saw what appear to look six lights but what call my attention was that in that part of the sky is imposible to place lights that was when I told my friend junior to stop his truck and we jumped to the ground .personaly what I saw was 2 separate ufo very close to each other steady in the air (no movement)(no sound) like if they were watching something suddenly one of then turned off it lights for 3 seconds and then turned then back on 3 seconds later both of then started moving very slow getting lost.we sat down and discussed what we really saw and concluded that those things couldnt be planes or helicopters because of the proximity to the ground which was very very close and besides they didnt produce no sound at all. I knew from the begining of this situation when I saw the lights that they were not regular and that we were facing something unknown.;39.9703;-75.0617
