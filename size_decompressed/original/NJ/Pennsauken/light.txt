THEY WERE STATIONARY FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS. THESE LIGHTS WERE NOT PLANES OR HELICOPTERS BECAUSE AS I SAID THEY MADE NO NOISE.THESE LIGHTS WERE LIKE AN ORANGE AND YELLOW MIXED. THE LIGHTS WERE ONE TOP OF THE OTHER BUT ONE LIGHT SEEMED TO BE IN FRONT OF THE OTHER.THEN ABOUT 2 HOURS FROM WHEN I FIRST SAW THE LIGHT THE DISSAPPEARED.;39.9703;-75.0617
