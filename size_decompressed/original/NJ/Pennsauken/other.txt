red object dips below commercial airliner;2006-08-12 11:00:00;15-20 seconds;red object dips below commercial airliner During lunch break, I was outside when I noticed a commercial airplane to my right. The moment I saw this airplane a flash occurred in this small portion of the sky. I could see a red glowing object half the size of the airplane, just ahead and below the nose of the airplane. The airplane was flying south to north, while the object flew east to west. It seemed to just miss the airplane as it shot downward to a slightly lower elevation. After the two crossed paths, the glowing subsided and the object appeared to take on more of a solid, flat, rectangle shape. Both the airplane and the object appeared to be traveling at roughly the same speed. The object continued in the same direction as I got up to get a better view. I took a few steps, looked back towards the sky and saw only the airplane. The object should still have been visible at the speed it was traveling due to my large view of the sky. I am certain from my viewing angle that this event took place directly above the delaware river/philadelphia area which was three miles away from my vantage point.;39.9703;-75.0617
