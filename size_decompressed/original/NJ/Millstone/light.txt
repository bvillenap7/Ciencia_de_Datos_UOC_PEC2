Dancing light in sky over N.J. pulsed, vanished in perfect visibility;2002-09-08 13:30:00;<1 minute;Dancing light in sky over N.J. pulsed, vanished in perfect visibility While laying on a hammock, looking straisght up I observed a white light against a pale blue / cloudfree sky.  The light danced around in an area as big as a softball held at arms length.  It moved, stopped, and changed directions faster than could be imagined.  It looked like the effect you might get as your watch crytal picks up light and dances on the ceiling.  The object moved to the south west, stopped, pulsed and got brighter / larger and vanished.;40.188885;-74.64388
