It was just before dusk.  I was driving a friend home, when we turned onto her street, many people were standing in the street looking up into the sky.  We got out of the car and looked up to see a huge saucer shaped UFO that had multi colored lights under it and it was very, very low. I can't say how long we stood there in amazement... I often call that friend and talk about it.  I've also searched websites looking for any one else who may have reported that sighting.  It took off over the Hudson and headed towards the George Washington bridge.  Three years ago, I told a friend in Boston about it and learned he lived in Queens at the time and remembers seeing it as well.  It was never in the newspaper or media. For some strange reason I couldn't talk about it for months. As though my mind was in a state of amnesia? ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
