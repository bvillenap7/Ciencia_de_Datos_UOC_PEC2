Unknown out of atmosphere object observed while star gazing.;2000-10-28 22:50:00;5-8 seconds;Unknown out of atmosphere object observed while star gazing. I was in my backyard stargazing with my telescope. It was a particuarly clear night and I was observing Jupiter and Saturn. I was gazing openly in to the sky without my telescope as a light caught my eye in the far western sky. ( Jupiter and Saturn being in the east and where my telescope was aimed ) I watched as the object darted across the sky and passed through Cassiopeia ( almost directly above my position ). It than moved towards Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter was to the lower left of Saturn. The object continued on its coarse passing just below Saturn from my perspective. The object apeared to not be in earths atmosphere. There was no discernable shape to the object and all I was able to observe was a brite white lite. The object was not a meteorite or any type of debrese because for one there was no tail and secondly it did not apear to move like previously observied meteorites.

From my view point...it was heading over new york from new jersey.Also I want to add that there were 2 more just as as bright however it was farther away from the main bulb...It DID not look like a light from a helicopter or plane! I noticed the bulb coast away west bound...Also the the was not cloudy-also I must add that this was a silent moving object...I am not a ufo buff...just giving you what I saw...the air felt different too,motionless,maybe just me...

A light appeared and shot across a small portion of the sky over the statue of liberty in an arc and then disappeared.;2010-04-13 22:45:00;Three Seconds;A light appeared and shot across a small portion of the sky over the statue of liberty in an arc and then disappeared. My girlfriend and I just walked out side to have a cigarette on the roof deck of our apartment which is about eight floors in the air and faces the statue of liberty.  Our apartment consists of two towers and the roof deck conneects them.  We are exactly one block away from the Hudson River so we are very close, and the sky was completely clear of clouds.  There were only other planes and a few stars in the sky. We sat down lit our cigarette when a singular light similar to a plane appeared and flashed across a specifc section of the sky in a downwards arc at an incredible speed of the likes I've never seen before.  Judging by the speed and trajectory this could not have been anything like a shoot star.  Also, because of the fact the light just went on then all of a sudden went off-not out of sight although we couldn't see it anymore-I do not think it was anything man made. I have never been on a UFO site before nor have I have had a sighting.  I do not know anything else that this could be.;40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438

It flew straight for a short distance then flew in a jittery zig zag pattern then flew straight again.   It repeated this pattern about 4 times then suddenly the lights of the object turned off.;40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438
Bright light surrounded by small lights, all change color and move in an strange manner.;2020-03-02 20:15:00;~30 minutes;Bright light surrounded by small lights, all change color and move in an strange manner. Two witnesses:  One 32 year old man who is a pharmacist, and one 34 year old man who is an operations manager for a commercial real estate company. I live in Jersey City, NJ on the 8th floor of a building. My large windows face west with minimal obstruction from buildings or trees.  The other witness spotted a bright light in the sky and told me to look at it (I’m a sky gazer and am familiar with the typical star layout – which isn’t much since we’re so close to NYC).  I walked to the window to check it out, and it looked exactly like a bright star.  But it was red and has also never been there before. I grabbed my binoculars, which are high powered, to take a look on the balcony.  The red light had about 5 or 6 smaller lights above it in a circular or possibly a hexagonal pattern, which were not visible to the naked eye.  The large light almost looked like it was jiggling a bit as if it was like a ball of jello.  Newark airport is nearby and I regularly watch the planes take off and land.  I have a real-time app on my phone to track all of the planes in the area since I find it interesting.  This object was not on the radar. After a few minutes of watching, it was clear that this wasn’t an aircraft that the average person is familiar with by any means.  Both the main bright light and the smaller lights above/surrounding it changed colors several times.  They were usually red and green, but sometimes white. The smaller lights above the main large light initially were stationary but then would start spinning in a bizarre manner as the “UFO” started moving or changing directions.  Left, right, forward, backward, ascending, descending.  All directions.  The object landed on the ground in the distance behind a building. I’m not sure how far away it was though.  It went straight down to the ground and straight back up on two occasions. I tried to capture a video with my iPhone while also looking through the binoculars because I couldn’t take my eyes off of it, but the iPhone video does no justice.  Although, in the video you can see the general movement of the light in the sky as well as the larger light changing in color. I have a few iPhone videos about 60-90 seconds long. In one of the videos there is a 2nd green light that looks almost orb-like that jumps around on its own and moves across the screen – I’m not sure if it’s related or not, but my phone was steady and the light moved around in an odd manner. While watching the videos in slow motion, there are other strange light movements that I originally didn’t notice. At one point there appears to be a slight trail of a light moving by quickly. I'm going to forward the videos and a map of my location to ufocntr@nwlink.com;40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438
