Within the atmosphere there is a bright white diamond shaped light in the sky. The sky is completely clear, no clouds. The object is standing still. I asked a few bystanders passing by what they thought it was and they said it was definitely not a star, planet, or plane. The people that observed the object with me were parents and adults that appeared to be in their late 20's and 30's. I noticed this object in the sky at 20:00 and it is still there, motionless. The current time is 21:05. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438
