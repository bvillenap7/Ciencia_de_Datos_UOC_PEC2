WOW NYC UFO SPOTTED ON WEBCAM !;2017-12-19 00:00:00;30 seconds;WOW NYC UFO SPOTTED ON WEBCAM! So I will watch different webcam’s that are close to me to try and see strange things. I saw a huge round object scan over the NYC skyline,  Very cool to say the least… I used to post a lot of these videos, but all anyone who ran these web sights ever said was, “No that’s A plane, or a helicopter”….. Yeah, sure and i’m Santa’s foreman at the toy shop in the north pole !!!  Hey see for yourself how large and slow this thing moves, then tell me its from here….!!!
