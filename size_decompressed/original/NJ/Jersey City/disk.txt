slow flying round shaped object with many lights flying at night in Jersey City,NJ;2008-09-18 21:00:00;10minutes;slow flying round shaped object with many lights flying at night in Jersey City,NJ I saw outside my window a slow round shaped object that was outlined in white lights. The object itself was like the color of tin can. I have a picture and zoomed in as much as I could. Unfortunately you can't see the lights in the picture but it was a pretty good shot. The object moved slowly going east, it lasted a long time but I couldn't see anymore out of my window.;40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438
Orange lights in sky above New jersey;2012-11-17 17:00:00;15 minutes;Orange lights in sky above New jersey We are in Jersey City, USA. We were looking out of the kitchen window towards  the south, kind of out over Newark airport. We saw three orange glows in the sky.  At first, I thought it must be the sun or moon, but they were clearly distinct shapes and they were moving kind of toward the left and downward until they finally disappeared behind the houses in the distance.  I would say they were not some kind of optical illusion, nor did they appear to be some kind of reflection caused by the sun.  They were definitely not airplanes. We then did some looking around online to see if anyone else had reported any similar sightings, and we found that there have been many reports in the last few years (one in my home town in Huntingdon, England) and others more locally.  Finally, we came across this website and decided to add our voice to the many others who say they have seen something.  I wouldn't like to say it was definitely something from outer space! Big claims require big evidence (or something like that) as someone once said. But they were definitely UFOs.;40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438
UFO in Bergenline, Red , Green , white lights Video taken;2018-04-09 21:30:00;~30 minutes;UFO in Bergenline, Red , Green , white lights Video taken A saucer shaped object was seen over a 20 floor building.  It was still, did not move but emitted Red, Green white lights from around the corners.   I ignored it at first, thinking it was a drone.  But helicopters and airplanes going around it caught my attention.  I took a video and it's pretty clear .;40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438
