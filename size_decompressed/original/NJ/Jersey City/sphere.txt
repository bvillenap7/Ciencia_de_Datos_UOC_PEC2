It did not have any blinking lights, tail or trail behind it and was absolutely silent. The object itself appeared to be dimly lit from within. We all remained silent and transfixed until it passed completely out of sight.;40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438
Silver spheres that appeared then quickly disappeared...;2000-10-23 14:00:00;ten seconds;Silver spheres that appeared then quickly disappeared... I am not totally sure if it was alien activity.  I believe it was because of something I read.  I was looking into the sky and I saw a silver ball flash very quickly and it disappeared.  I had read an article once on how you can communicate with it telepathically.  In my mind I said appear again and it did.  Then I asked if it was alone, then alot of the silver balls appeared but disappeared in the matter of seconds.  I saw it from Jersey City, but it was over the Manhattan skyline.  I asked it to appear again and nothing happened.  I asked several of my friends if they had seen any weird actvity in the sky at about that time.  They all said no.  If there are any other reports about this in this area around this time, please inform me at ((e-address deleted)). Thank You ((name deleted));40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438
Copper sphere sighted over Jersey City . Sphere maintains consistent altitude.;2002-10-07 11:28:00;30 seconds;Copper sphere sighted over Jersey City . Sphere maintains consistent altitude. The sphere was approx 2-3 feet in diameter ( an estimate based on its visibility in reference to the Chase building about a half-mile away and its relative size in comparison with Chase's satellite dishes) . The sphere was of an unmistakeable copper finish.  It was not emitting light but reflecting it.  It turned black & shadowy on its lower half  intermittently giving an impression of undulation.  It flew a straight and consistent flight path SW-NE maintaining altitude of about  300 feet. Its trajectory and path was too straight for a balloon to maintain for the duration that I witnessed. It made no sound.;40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438

A single sphere of white light appeared out of nowhere in the sky. It hovered for a moment in mid-air, before shooting down in an arc very quickly. Five times the size of the planes that were passing nearby. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD));40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438
