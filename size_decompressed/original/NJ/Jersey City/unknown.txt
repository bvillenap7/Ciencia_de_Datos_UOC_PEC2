It was not unreal fast, but too fast for something flying at that level. I thought it was a fighter jet but it didn't make any sound. I was on the couch looking out the window when I saw it and went to the balcony. The object turned back south and as it came closer I saw a bright beam of light (like xenon headlights of a car, just very big). It went behind a big cloud and I couldnt spot it afterwards. I wouldn't say it was definitely a ufo, but crazy enough for me to report this and try to find out what it was.;40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438
