Very fast green hazy fireball over jersey city NJ;2011-07-13 21:40:00;12 sec;Very fast green hazy fireball over jersey city NJ My lady and I were watching television this evening.  Our sofa faces the west window exposure in our loft.  It was around 9:40 p.m. when I jumped off the couch yelling what the he'll is that?!?  My lady looked and couldn't believe it either.  What we had seen was a green fireball like object jet across the window exposure wickedly fast.  There was a small trail behind it but quickly dissipated.  The fireball then vanished into the sky while moving south west.  What's interesting is that I've seen this green fireball twice before in a property we lived in just one block east from where we currently reside in 2004.  It was seen traveling in the same south west direction.  My lady didn't necessarily believe me until this evening.  I can say what we saw this evening lasted roughly 12-15 seconds.  In our prior living space we had north west exposures so I know it had come from that direction.  Tonight It just appeared west and travelled south west.  She and I thought maybe fireworks initially but there are no structures surrounding to allow a launch in that direction especially being it moved horizontally.   I have an iron clad memory and know without a shadow of doubt this IS the same gree fireball light I've seen twice in 2004.;40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438
Fiery circular craft spotted hovering in Jersey City and then vanishes;2019-07-03 17:50:00;60 seconds;Fiery circular craft spotted hovering in Jersey City and then vanishes After watching the latest Spiderman movie with my family at Newport Center Mall in Jersey City we headed home.  After leaving the mall garage, we cut through the BJ’s shopping center area and my wife (seated in the passenger seat) says, “What is that in the sky?”.  A few seconds after, my cousin seated behind my wife saw it too.  Since it was visible on the right side and I was driving I couldn’t see it initially.  Then I opened the moonroof of my truck and I was finally able to see it.  Shortly after my son saw it as well. It looked like a large circular fireball hovering over a distant city somewhere west of us in NJ.  It was about as high as a plane would be flying.  The appearance of the ball seemed like a glowing orange fiery light and it seemed like it had some type of aura.  My wife’s first thought was that it was a plane on fire.  But after watching the object for about 30 seconds that claim was quickly refuted.  I asked if someone could take out their phone to! record it.  My son immediately began to reach for his phone and as he started reaching for it to the second this bright orange object began to move North in a linear fashion.  As it started to move this bright orange light that lit up the night sky began to diminish in a matter of seconds until it was completely dim and vanished out of sight.  It’s almost as though it knew we were about to record it.;40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438
