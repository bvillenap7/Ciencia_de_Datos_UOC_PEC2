A 747 jet was coming over the sky line & near it a slightly lite blurry small area of the sky. Three orbs of light came through whatever the liter area of the clouds were & proceeded to literally do laps around the 747. It was akin to a swarm of flys in the sense each has its own free movement but follows with the swarms general movement. So these things lapped(seemed to be playing with it). It was an amazing experience! ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438
