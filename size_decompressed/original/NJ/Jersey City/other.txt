Worm shaped object seen by at least 6 adults from Jersey City back yards;2007-06-27 20:45:00;10 minutes;Worm shaped object seen by at least 6 adults from Jersey City back yards I was with two other people (all adults) in the back yard in the evening, right around dusk. There were 3 adults and 2 children in the adjacent yard. We all saw a silent, dark gray object in the sky, it looked like it was a few miles away, just above the tree line. It was worm shaped, it looked kind of like a para-sail. It seemed to have three sections that were fairly straight, but combined together to make a shallow downward facing C shape - the open part of the C facing the ground. At first I thought it was a balloon or a kite, but it didn't behave like either. I ran into the house to find a camera, when I returned, it had moved to a new position, and had become much fainter. I watched it gradually, over a period of 2 - 3 minutes, grow fainter and fainter, until it vanished. It was also growing darker at the same time. It may have simply vanished into some clouds, but it was starting to grow dark outside, so it was hard to tell if there were clouds that it could have disappeared into.  I took a picture with my cell phone camera-you can see something there, but it just looks like a blurry smudge. I took some pics with a digital camera, but unfortunately, i couldn't figure out how to turn the flash off. I also took some video with the digital camera, but by that time, the object had grown very faint, and it was growing dark outside.  We did see and hear an aircraft approach the same area at great speed. I was unable to tell what kind of aircraft it might be, but it sounded like a military jet.;40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438

Then it suddenly just disappeared. Just like that.;40.7274412859559;-74.0598265651438
