Strange Upright Cylinder crosses over New York City before disappearing behind the clouds.;2003-07-19 18:30:00;5 minutes;Strange Upright Cylinder crosses over New York City before disappearing behind the clouds. A friend and I were on the roofdeck watching the Manhattan skyline when we noticed an upright cylindrical object appear in the sky on the Southwest tip of Manhattan.   It ascended slowly and without sound, maintaining constant ascent and flight path towards the center of  Manhattan , changing shape and color several times  before it  disappeared behind the clouds. The object was a whitish/grey matte finish with a trace of red color. Perhaps due to the setting sun, its redness  seemed to intensify as it climbed higher. No light emissions. The object was relatively big,  half a thumbnail size at arm's full extension when it was first sighted. Estimated altitude range at 10,000 ft. - 35,000 ft. based on various commercial aircraft and helicopters (approx. 7) that crossed the sky during the event.  The cylinder maintained its amazing  upright posture throughout its flight.  We were not under the influence of any intoxicants or alcohol. Unfortunately, we were too mesmerized to grab a camera. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that a blimp would be the first possibility to be ruled out, although we suspect the witness probably considered such a possibility during his sighting.
