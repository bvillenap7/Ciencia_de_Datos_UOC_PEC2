It was exactly 12:50 PM. On Sunday, November 9, 2014, at 12:50 P.M.  While I was in my back yard in Wanaque, I saw two, what appeared to be either F-16s or F-18s chasing an object over the Ramapo Mountains just east of the Wanaque Reservoir. 	The planes flew very low and very fast.  I looked up when I heard the sound of the jet engines, and what I saw ahead of them was a very small, silvery dot.  They flew from the south over route 287 in Haskell and banked sharply east over Midvale and went over the Mountains in the direction of Oakland. 	I checked the local news for any mention of an air show and found nothing.  These two planes, and the object in front of them were flying way too low and too fast to be a normal training flight.  As I stated earlier, I could not tell if the planes were F-16s or F-18s because they were right above me when they turned east.  I was on a westerly facing mountain slope at an elevation of 460 above sea level.;41.0558;-74.2804
