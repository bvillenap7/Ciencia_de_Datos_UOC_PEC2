The witness observed a round object fall to the earth. It was very bright white light and seemed to be about the size of a street light when standing abot 10 feet away. The object had a tail which seemed to linger.  It disappeared behind a building and seemed to have hit the ground fairly close but there was no sound. I was with the witness but saw and heard nothing as I was driving.  The witness is a manager of a restaruant and in my opinion very reliable.;41.0558;-74.2804
