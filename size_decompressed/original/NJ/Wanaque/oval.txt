Pulsating light blue orb falling straight down to the ground.;2010-07-02 10:15:00;5 seconds;Pulsating light blue orb falling straight down to the ground. Driving back on 287 South Bound right before the Wanaque Bridge between exits 57 and  55, I witnessed what appeared to be a pulsating light blue orb falling straight and quickly towards the ground with a extremely narrow and straight grey tail.  There was no sound.   It fell behind trees, and there was no impact light or blast.   There were other cars around me that slowed down, possibly because they saw what I saw.   Anybody else in the area see it?;41.0558;-74.2804
