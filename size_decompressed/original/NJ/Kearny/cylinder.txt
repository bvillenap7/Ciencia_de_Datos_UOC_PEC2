Oject moved slowly to the north still in an upright pos I came out onto my back deck with my dog.  I was facing west when I saw the bright lights.  There was a cylindrical shaped object with bright  white, green and some red lights coming out of the bottom of the shape. I ran upstairs to get my husband.  We both looked out our 2nd floor bathroom window.  The object was still there, not moving, just hovering. We both went down to the deck.  The object was still there.  There was no noise, no movement, just flame or electric-like lights coming out of the bottom.  Other lighting must have been on the sides or from within because the cylinder was was entirely lit up a yellowish white. The glow surrounded the entire object. Suddenly it rose straight up.  It did not make any noise.  It reached just above the rooftops of the houses behind us and started to move sideways.  It moved to the north at a very slow speed.  It did not turn on its side when it began it travel north.  It remained upright. We lost sight of the object behind trees and taller houses.
