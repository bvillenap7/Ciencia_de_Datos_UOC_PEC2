light makes L- shape turn in sky;2007-03-18 20:10:00;40 seconds;light makes L- shape turn in sky i was waiting for my wife to come home from work so i was looking out the window.while waiting there, i started looking up at the nightsky which was very clear,i was interested in how much the stars stood out so when she got home i went outside to ask my neighbor if he had binoculars or a telescope to look at the stars.we both went outside with some binoculars and began looking so i passed the binoculars to him then i was looking all around at the different constillations when i noticed this very small light far away, was moving.i felt it wasnt a plane cause it was very far and i was looking directly upward not in a angle.so i pointed it out to my neighbor. we're both following it as it was moving smootly through the sky saying how it's too far to be a plane when out of nowhere it makes a sharp L-shape turn very fast and disappear into this aura of light that i can only discribe as quotation marks of blurring light.just like when a ship goes into warp speed in the movies.i stayed out for like a half hour looking in shock for more lights and my neighbor ran inside to tell his brothers.the more i looked the more i hoped to see andother. while staring directly up at the sky i saw one again. in a far distance another very small light, far away, which i felt was too small and far to be a plane,was flying smoothly through the sky.i followed it with my eyes for as long as i saw it but it just kept on going. this one didn't make any sharp unexplained turns.still all in all i am convinced that i saw something im not sure what but it was weird..if anyone can figure this out post a comment.;40.7642999999999;-74.1480000000001
