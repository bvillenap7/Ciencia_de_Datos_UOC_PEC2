As you kmow-it is pretty dark at 3:30 am.  What caught my eye was i looked out living room window (on fourth floor of apartment building) and saw a round shape in the distance just sitting there - flashes of red, yellow, and green.  I woke my husband and asked him to look to so I was sure i was seeing what i was.  it looks like a spinning orb as the lights pass, however it is in distance.  My husband was passing it off as star clusters.  But as i sit here now and look at it - it still peeks my curiosity.  We live in flight pattern for newark airport- and i am used to seeing helicopetrs hover and plane lights - but never have i seen anything like this.sometimes the white is really bright and then fades- but its just hovering.  I wish someone could tell me what this is.;40.7642999999999;-74.1480000000001
