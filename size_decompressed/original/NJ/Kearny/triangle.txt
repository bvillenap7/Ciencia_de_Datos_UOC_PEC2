As i cross to the other side of the street i happen to look back where I was to find out what was the humming and i noticed what i thought it was a small plane because of the blinking green, red and white light! but then again, it really wasn't moving or sounding like a plane.  It was also flying kind of low, around 500 feet.  I sat down in a bench trying to find out what it was but it was too dark to see anything beside the lights.  i assumed it was in a triangular shape because in the direction it was traveling or hovering had a rectangular shape light and then 2 other rectangular shape light in the back and the red, green and white lights were in middle of the ship. after a few minutes a light came out of the ship, it looked like a fired fly just flying around the ship but it was moving pretty quick and then it banished into the ship after that I just proceded to wal! k home;40.7642999999999;-74.1480000000001
