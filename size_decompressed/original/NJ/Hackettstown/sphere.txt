two bright spheres moving very fast and erratic;2007-04-28 21:30:00;15 seconds;two bright spheres moving very fast and erratic at approx 9:30pm I was standing outside looking at the sky. The sky was clear and windy and cold. The moon was almost full. The wind kicked up quite a bit and I saw a patch of clouds pas by the moon. Just then to my left, I observed 2 bright spheres traveling across the sky. The one sphere was steady and the other was moving around it. The one sphere was on top and then it would move around to the front of it and below, very eradictly. I observed these spheres for about 15-20 seconds. they moved faster than any airplane i have ever seen and they were above the clouds.;40.8566;-74.8389
