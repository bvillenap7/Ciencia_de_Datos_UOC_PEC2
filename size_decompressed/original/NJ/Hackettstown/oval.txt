Oval shape objects that would make 90 degree turns with lights during summer nights.;2013-08-03 00:00:00;seconds;Oval shape objects that would make 90 degree turns with lights during summer nights I saw 5 different oval shapes objects shoot across the south sky at night time for the past 5 years living in New Jersey, I also lived in Maryland and saw oval objects in the Northwest night sky.  It happens during summer time.  The colors are green, red, white, yellow-whitish and blue-green lights of the objects.  All 5 objects didn't show up at the same time, I would see sometimes two or one at a time.  I saw them myself in my backyard and front yard at night time. I don't have photos or videos, but I can draw or describe them.  I am a simple and normal man.  I did not contact right way because I did not know were to start and who would I tell and believe me.
