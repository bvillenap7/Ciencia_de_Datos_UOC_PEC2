Looking nearly directly northward overhead or at a slight arc, a pinpoint light appeared (star-like).  Beneath the light was an illuminated area, that formed an inverted v shape, that appeared like 'fog'.  The pinpoint light did not move.  It eventually dimmed and went out.  The illuminated 'fog' appeared for a while later - maybe 20-30 sec then dimmed out as well..  The sky was crystal clear all day and no clouds.  The clarity extended well into the evening.  There was no moon out.;40.8566;-74.8389
3 orange lights in sky.;2013-12-25 21:30:00;~5 minutes;3 orange lights in sky. I was walking my dog and saw 3 orange lights in the sky heading NW.  They did not appear to be airplanes because there was no engine sounds and the lights were orange and they were not following typical flight paths that I've seen with planes.  They were in a loose v formation/ obtuse triangle.  I saw stars in between the 3 lights so I knew it was not a single craft.  The light in the more northern position suddenly made a relatively sharp turn and headed north/northeast.  The other 2 continued NW and began to cross cross paths until the tree line of a western mountain/hill blocked my view.;40.8566;-74.8389
