My wife and witnessed a fireball-like object passing south to north just off the Jersey coastline at Barnegat.   It was quiet and fairly low altitude, flying north smoothly until it disappeared somewhere around Forked River.   It appeared to be an aircraft on fire from the way the bright light flickered, but we could not determine any shape of the object because of this.   There was no smoke trail.;39.7576;-74.2496000000001

Saw 3 orange fireball looking flying objects in the shape of a perfect pyramid in the night sky.  They stayed perfectly still and suddenly all aligned perfectly spaced out and in a perfect line.   Then one at a time they disappeared very rapidly.;39.7576;-74.2496000000001
