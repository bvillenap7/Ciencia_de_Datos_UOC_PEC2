two red blinking lights moving very slowly than dissappeared;2011-05-05 23:00:00;5 minutes;two red blinking lights moving very slowly than dissappeared I was looking out my window facing south and saw two blinking red lights moving together at one time very slowly.  it seemed to be on one aircraft, but could have been two seperate crafts.    It was not a plan because it seemed to hover and not move at all for awhile.   when it did move, it moved very slow.  than it went down into the marsh lands.
