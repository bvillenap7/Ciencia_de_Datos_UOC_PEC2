moving fast, bright light, long tail, burned out. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 20:15:00;1 minute;moving fast, bright light, long tail, burned out. I was on the beach fishing and looking at the stars. I looked at my rod and when I looked into the sky I saw something unexplainable. It lookied like a spotlight at first but it soon changed. It was a bright white light orb in the southern sky going north. behind it was a tail of gold sparkles. I was amazed and a little worried. The tail grew out and longer, like an opening umbrella. The orb disapeared into thin air after about 20 seconds, but left the tail for another 45 seconds. I did not leave until 2 hours later and had no other sightings of the object.
