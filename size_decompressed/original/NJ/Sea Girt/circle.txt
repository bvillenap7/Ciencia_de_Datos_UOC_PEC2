I walked outside to smoke a cig and as I turned my head towards the neighbors yard a small circle of light appeared, traveled for approx 2 seconds downward at a steep angle, then disappeared. I thought it might've been a comet at first (before it vanished), then maybe a spark from a fireworks display, but there were no fireworks around. I looked all around my house, asked my friends if they had lit anything, etc. It seemed pretty small, but it could've been in the way distance. It disappeared before it hit the tree line so I had no indication. It seemed perfectly white (but not really glowing, didn't notice a halo around it) and also perfectly round. Startled the hell out of me, that's for sure. No sound at all. It was west of my house, which is about half a mile away from the Atlantic Ocean, central NJ.;40.14;-74.04
