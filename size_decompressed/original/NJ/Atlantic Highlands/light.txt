Unexplained light;2011-08-13 18:20:00;5 to 7 sec;Unexplained light Over cast evening at the marina.  I was just watching the ships sail by when I looked up and saw a light.  It was like a star but maybe five to seven hundred feet above the water.  It stood out against the grey clouds like a spotlight.  I thought at first it was a plane and expected it to move towards me but after five seconds motionless it shot straight up and dissapeared through the clouds.   Have no idea what it was. But thought I should report it.;40.3975;-74.0297
