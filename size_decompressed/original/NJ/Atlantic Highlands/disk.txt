I live in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey. The night sky has been looking unusual for the past month. On Monday, September 17th 2012 at 9 pm, I saw a flying object or saucer in the night sky over my house. It lasted 2 minutes as it hovered, and then it went down the road to the right.  It was a circular object. I also read a book that a UFO was hurting someone's body. I don't want this to happen to me. That is very high technology and I don't understand how that was happening to him. It is very hard for me to live with that thought that that can happen to people.  Please if there is any way that you can shut the UFO down and move it over the glaciers, I would appreciate it.  Thank you for your help.
