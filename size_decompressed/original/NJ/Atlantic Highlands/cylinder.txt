Small White UFO Flying Treetop Level, Possible Probe to 9 Other Larger UFO's Offshore in NJ;2005-08-27 00:15:00;2 minutes;Small White UFO Flying Treetop Level, Possible Probe to 9 Other Larger UFO's Offshore in NJ I was smoking a cigarette on my patio (2nd story high)at 12:15am and while noticing one of my neighbors across the way i saw the object pass right in front of me since i was looking in the general direction. Mind you, the area i live has a small wooded mountain in front of me so the object passed below the mountain height level and was highly visable due to the white light contrast against a black backround. The object was approx. 6-7 stories high in flight and traveling at a 100+ mph rate of speed..it was fast but not fast enough for the naked eye to catch. Shape was hard to determine but a close guess was it was shaped like a cup or cone (size like a beer bottle) and emitted a white trail in its wake. No sound at all but it passed in front of me(30 feet away)and navigated through some treetops towards the ocean. (Sandy Hook area) Once i looked at the area it traveled too i noticed that the cloud formation that had just been formed but wasnt there a minute ago. There was one very large cloud with 9 smaller clouds ascending/descending from it in tight formation, all equally the same size and distance from each other. One minute later they all disapeared and the sky was totally clear again. Im a military veteran so im familiar with logical earthbound craft and wasnt drinking, or on medication, etc.;40.3975;-74.0297
