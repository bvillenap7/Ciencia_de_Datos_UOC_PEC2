It did not blink nor did it make any sound.  It was difficult to estimate the altitude, but the sky was totally clear. I saw it for about 2.5 minutes.  It moved from about due north to due south and appeared to be going slowly for a plane or satellite.  I looked up all satellite passes at my zip code and there were none at the time.  I saw it at approximately 9:00 pm Eastern time near Atlantic City, NJ. I shot about 2 minutes of video on my iPhone, however it does not look very much like what it looked like in person. It was very bright â€“ brighter than Venus, but not as bright as the moon.;39.3774;-74.5612
