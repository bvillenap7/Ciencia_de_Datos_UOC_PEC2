Shape of Object Hexagonal/circle. Size: Varied from a pea at arms length to a dime at arms length. Color Red about the perimeter, with a whitest center. Movement: Stationary and then would move to the east the color would diminish in intensity. Object stopped in the distance then returned to original location when fireworks resumed. Remarks: My son another, and myself were watching the fireworks display when my son pointed out an object that appeared to be hovering in the air. I looked up at it and it was unusual in both color and shape. The ambient noise made it impossible to determine if there was any associated engine noise, but the object was indeed unusual. For the time that we observed it, it moved several times. The impression was that it was demonstrating an interest in the fire works, and we discussed the possibility of it being a helicopter or balloon/dirigible observing the firework display.  My son pointed out that the lighting was not correct for either.  Upon conclusion of the firework display, the object traveled quite fast to the east where we lost sight of it.  We then walked over to a local dinner approximately a 15-minute walk.  Before entering the dinner, I looked back in the direction of where the object had been and it had returned.  This coincided with the start of another townsâ€™ commencing of! a fireworks display. Several weeks later, I check with the Parks Department of Red Bank for any information concerning the possible photographing of the fireworks display from an airborne platform.  The individual that I spoke with was unaware of any photo operation.  The location of the event is several miles from a naval weapons station, so I guess the possibility exists that it might have been some security operation.;40.3584;-74.0681
