NJ: Bright Blue and Orange lights (2X)  at approx 01:15 am (as seen from exit 114 of the GSP);2003-09-19 01:15:00;1 minute;NJ: Bright Blue and Orange lights (2X)  at approx 01:15 am (as seen from exit 114 of the GSP) While traveling home from work early yesterday (Sat morn) on the Garden State Pkwy south, I passed the Middletown Holmdel exit (114) and at approx mile marker 112 I observed a brilliant blue light to the east of the GSP (my left while traveling south) I estimated that the blue light lasted approx 2-3 seconds and was followed by a brilliant orange light of the same magnitude and time constant as the Blue light (approx 7-10 air miles wide of pure light in each instance). As I pondered what the heck I saw approx 25-30 seconds later, the blue light appeared again at the same intense illumination and for the same amount of time. The orange light appeared again as well.  I am certain that at least 20-30 travelers on the GSP saw what I saw as we all slowed down to see what was going on. There wasnt any sound associated with these lights but they were nothing I have ever seen in my 38 years of being here.  Since the GSP has trees along its banks, it made it difficult to see what caused the illuminations but it was clear that whatever it was made pure daylight for 3 seconds for quite some distance along the NJ shore..
