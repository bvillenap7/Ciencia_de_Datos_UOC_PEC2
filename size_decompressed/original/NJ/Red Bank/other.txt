UFO looks like Chemical Structure of Carbon.;2006-08-15 19:30:00;4 minutes;UFO looks like Chemical Structure of Carbon. Unidentified is all I mean... It drifted by silently, as I had camera in hand, and should have used movie mode from the start. At least I have a few good pics, but it was really oddly shaped.  It looked to me, from eyesight (I have 20/10 vision I found out at my last physical) like 3 spheres, with a round sphere on top and a smaller red sphere on top of that, making it look triangular or pyramid in shape. It also moved by silently as it drifted.  Here are links atttached to the pic and video. On the picture I enlarged the object and placed it to the left of what I saw between the phonelines.  http://i113.photobucket.com/albums/n220/IGASOP/UFO_maybe.jpg http://media.putfile.com/UFO-26 = Video   PS - Add to this... this same object was spotted 3 days later at the same location, this time moving West to East, not South to North as it was on 08/15/06;40.3584;-74.0681
