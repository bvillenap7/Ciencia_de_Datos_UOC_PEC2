Observed 3 red-orange objects in a trianglur formatation hovering in evening sky.;2014-09-27 20:30:00;10 minutes;Observed 3 red-orange objects in a trianglur formatation hovering in evening sky. My wife and I returned from dinner at approximately 8:30PM when we noticed a neighbor of ours standing on the side of the road looking up on in the sky.   As we passed him and turned the corner to our place, we glanced up and saw 3 red-orange fire balls illuminated in the sky.  This is similar to another report on 8/31 by another witness. The 3 objects were moving in somewhat of a triangle formation upon initial viewing, however, they appeared to hover and move in separate directions and at different rate of speeds.  Ironically, we saw a plane pass by them, detected by the blinking light, and it appeared to stay straight and without changing direction.
