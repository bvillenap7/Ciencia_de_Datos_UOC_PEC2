Last night at 7:26 p.m. while driving through Hillsborough, NJ, my daughter and I noticed a large, bright orange triangle in the sky.  the night was very clear, no clouds and no wind.   The object was moving slowly and was at least 1 mile away.  It was very large and very bright.  There were two other cars pulled to the side of the road also.  We left before it did, as the area was not safe to remain parked.;40.4856;-74.6265000000001

East sky, three red light, in the shape of a triangle moving west, then stopped lights together move back the direction they came, but it appeared as though they had separated a little, forming a distorted triangle, then all three faded out as they ascended upward.  I had no phone on me, was walking my dog.  I asked other people I encountered on the walk and no one stated that they saw anything.  I placed a call local police and described what I saw.  Nothing more.;40.4856;-74.6265000000001
