It was moved slowly across the sky.  the object appeared to move under its own power. It was moving too fast and travelling in to deliberate fashion to have been a balloon.  It was much shinier than a mylar balloon, and also appeared much larger. There were both childern and adults present at the sighting.   We watched the object until it was obscured by the trees.;40.4856;-74.6265000000001
