Sun reflection off a stationary rectangular object in a completely clear blue sky.;2005-06-19 19:43:00;1 hour;Sun reflection off a stationary rectangular object in a completely clear blue sky. Small star-like stationary object, rectangular in shape, spotted while looking up at aircraft inbound to Newark International (EWR). First feeling was that it was the bright reflection of the sun off of a Mylar party balloon. However it did not move. Absolutely clear sky and no movement. Sighted and aligned the object against my deck posts as reference. It did not move. Made an assumption that it was likely the International Space Station's Solar panels reflecting the sun. It was there for a good while. Finally noticed that it was gone. A Southwest Airlines jet allowed me a point of reference and I snapped the digital image that will accompany this report. The object is to the left and above the jet.;40.4856;-74.6265000000001
UFO in Hillsborough, NJ.  ((anonymous report));2016-05-08 23:50:00;30 minutes;UFO in Hillsborough, NJ. On my way home driving along the backroads of dukes park, two bright lights hovered over my vehicle,  moving slow and soundless.  I took multiple pictures and video from my iPhone 6+ and showed it friends and family.  It's so amazing these objects where distinctly unique.  This sighting is not my first but this is just up close and so vividly clear not from this planet!   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
