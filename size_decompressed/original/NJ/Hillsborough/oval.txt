Somewhat a clear sky last night, few cloud clouds here and there, almost a full moon. My husband said look at that, that's not a plane. It never moved, itjust hovered about 5 miles away but we easily seen that it had pale gold and pale red lights that went across the front horizonally, which blinked and not a real fast blink. Then it was gone, no take off, nothing that you could see it leaving it just vanished into thin air. We never took our eyes off it and the most amazing part of it was the way it was there then gone.;40.4856;-74.6265000000001
