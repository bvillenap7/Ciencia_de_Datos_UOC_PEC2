Large bright circular light that got smaller and smaller until it disappeared.  I was on top of a building on the roof, and happened to catch something bright from the corner of my eye in the sky, when I looked up I saw a big flash of white light shaped like a big orb for about 1-2 seconds and then it dimmed down a bit, then the light started getting smaller and smaller while traveling slowly across the sky until it disappeared. It just vanished. It wasn't an airplane, it just vanished!   Then about 5 minutes later higher up in the sky I saw a little dot of white moving across (not a plane) then when it got directly over my head it flashed into a big circular white light again for about 2 seconds then it dimmed down and kept moving across the sky slowly until the light vanished.  By vanish I dont mean it kept going across the sky until I could no longer see it but it died like blowing out a fire on the spot! .;40.4856;-74.6265000000001
