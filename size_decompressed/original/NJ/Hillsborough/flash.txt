I thought it was lightning aqt first because it was about 3 bright quick flashes. Told my husband and within seconds the light flashes started again.  This time they were VERY bright and non stop and with them was SOUND. Sounded like a very large electrical sound.  It hummed in time with the lights and then it all stopped. My husband and I both heard and saw it. My 9 year old daughter who was sleeping was woken by it.  She  heard and saw the same thing. We all saw the light source in a different direction though.  I saw it brighter in the back of the house, my daughter from the front and my husband from the side.  I went outside and there was no smell or lights and NO police or fire sirens, as something that big and loud had to be a transformer or something large and electrical...no reports last night or this morning on the local news. Last night I ran ofver to my neighbor to ask if she experie! nced this too....she only heard it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous provides little contact data.
