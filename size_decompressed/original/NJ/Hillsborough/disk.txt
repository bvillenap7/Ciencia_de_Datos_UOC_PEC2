At approximately 8:47PM my daughter and I were driving home, when at the same time we spotted a very large, very bright, saucer  shaped object in the sky.  It had bright red lights around the perimeter that were blinking on and off in succession  The disc-shaped object was so bright, it appeared to glow.  Far off in another direction, we saw a  helicopter, and by comparison, the size of this unknown craft was at least 10 times bigger.  We followed it by car, as it moved just over the tree tops in our view.  It flew on an even plane, at a speed that seemed faster than a blimp, but slower than an airplane.  We watched it for about 10 minutes before it flew out of our sight.  It was a very clear night and we saw this object very clearly.;40.4856;-74.6265000000001
