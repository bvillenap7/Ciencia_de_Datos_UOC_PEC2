White, star-like object, slow moving silent light in Bergen Cty. NJ.  ((anonymous report));2018-08-04 01:30:00;45 minutes;White, star-like object, slow moving silent light in Bergen Cty. NJ Star-like object that appeared to hover like a drone.  Changed position slowly, no sound.  Sometimes a very small blink of red and white lights near the main white light source.  At one point that main white light looked like it extended into beams of light, like the star of Bethlehem. Object seen from Ridgefield, appearing to be over the Fairview or North Bergen area, south of New York City. Watched object for approximately 45 mins then it appeared to move behind trees out of my view, but still in the sky currently.  I didn’t panic or call authorities thinking it’s likely a drone or military surveillance craft.  I’ve seen more of these near Lakewood near the naval base.
