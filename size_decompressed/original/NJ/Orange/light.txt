Bright white light  (occasionally diming and becoming fully bright again) displaying odd movements over the SW skies of Orange, NJ;2013-10-13 19:00:00;30+ minutes;Bright white light  (occasionally diming and becoming fully bright again) displaying odd movements over the SW skies of Orange, NJ Single white light, appearing to be an airplane (silent, without noise of any kind), coming up from the south-southwest, heading north-east.  The light came up over the tree line of the backyard, then stopped and maintained it's position in the sky (max height: about 40-50 degrees above the horizon).  After about 10 minutes, the light dimmed and stayed dim for approx. 2-3min, then came back to full brightness (as bright as the ISS would be in a clear night sky) - this behavior happened about 4 times total.  The light stayed in a constant position relative to the moon (during this time, the moon had risen approx. 70-80 degrees above the horizon).  As the object seemed to move with the rotation of the earth, it soon became harder to view due to the tree line (from which it initially rose above) and we could no longer locate/track the light. Before the light disappeared behind the tree line, we noticed another seemly white light appear flying from the east toward this light.  When the two lights were close to each other, the original light quickly became dim-to-invisible, while the other light seemed to become two lights, flashed in an alternating pattern, became dim-to-invisible also.  We were initially aware of this because we live near a major airport so flying craft from commercial aircraft to recreational aircraft are seen regularly.  This one was strange because it came from a place in the sky outside the flight path that aircraft would normally approach. The above is an observation of something we normally do not see over the skies of this part of New Jersey.  Its behavior was suspicious so we wanted to put it on record.
