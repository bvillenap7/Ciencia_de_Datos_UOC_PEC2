My boyfriend was outside smoking a cigarette and yelled for me to come outside.  He told me to hurry, because he just saw the entire sky flash red, blue and green lights.  I ran downstairs hoping I would see it and about a minute later, I also saw the same thing.  But this wasn't just a portion of the sky or fireworks, THE ENTIRE SKY quickly flashed the colors red, blue and green.  He took out his phone to hopefully record it and it did happen once more, but the video for some reason didn't even show any change in color.  I've googled to see if anyone has seen anything like this and it seems that one other person witnessed the same thing.;40.6773;-74.4954
