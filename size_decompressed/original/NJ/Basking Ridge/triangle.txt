Just under the low cloud cover, I observed a very large, black triangular object with flashing red, white and blue lights.  It was moving at a very high speed and was not making the sounds that a low flying airplane would.  I kept losing it among tall trees and houses, but I did follow it long enough (and saw it enough times) to see it make a sharp turn downward and to the left, all the while its lights flashing brightly and appearing to alternate in color from red to white to blue. I parked in front of my house and ran from my car just as the craft disappeared from view above and behind the trees of the Bonnie Brae School.  The area was completely silent and there were no other witnesses.  I looked for the craft to reappear and sadly was not able to get any photos of it.  Due to the shape, the changing color of the rapidly flashing lights and the silent, sharp turns it took, I was completely sure that what I saw was not an airplane.  I am wondering if any other Basking Ridge area residents saw what I saw.;40.6793;-74.5574
