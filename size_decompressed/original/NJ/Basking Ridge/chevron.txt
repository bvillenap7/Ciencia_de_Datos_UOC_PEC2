Daylight NJ i78 large chevron shaped craft 50 plus eye witnesses;1988-08-07 15:30:00;30 seconds;Daylight NJ i78 large chevron shaped craft 50 plus eye witnesses In August 1988 my parents and I were traviling east on I-78 from Clinton NJ to Newark airport.  While in the vicinity of Basking Ridge near the wildlife overpasses with relay towers on the north side of the highway, I caught a glimpse of something large aproaching the highway from the south.   I leaned forward to get a better look and in doing so saw a airborn vehicle approximatly 40 to 50 yds from tip to tip.  The shape was that of a cresent moon or chevron which was light metalic grey in color. I would estimate that the craft elavation was no more than 400ft.  I told my parents as we passed under it but the brake lights were distracting them as both lanes of traffic were rapidly coming to a halt as people saw the object.  The entire viewable amount of time I had to observe the object was aproxamatly 30 seconds.  This sighting was in broad daylight around 3:30pm.  The object was moving sideways tip to tip.   When I stuck my head out the window I noticed that there was no discernable noise generated by the craft.  The craft was moving far to slow to remain airborn by any conventional means of propulsion that I am familar with.  There were five lights across the front arc and a panel of white lights pulsing a pattern rythmicly as we drove under it.   I know other people saw this craft and am very anxious to speak with anyone with anybody who could confirm this sighting for me.  This was absolutley not a blimp!
