Star moving on a zig zag and cicular motion.;2003-11-03 17:40:00;45 minutes;Star moving on a zig zag and cicular motion. November 3, 2003 Today about 5:40 I was watching the sunset, when i saw something that looked like a star, but it was moving in circules and zig zag, it moved for aobut 5 seconds then it stopped. It continued for about an hour, then it became steady. At first I thought that my vision was playing with me, or may be the clouds, but i tryed looking at other stars, and they did not move at all. After an hour, the light became staedy and stop moving. I do not know if what i saw was an ufo, but it was too high to be a plane or a helicopter.;40.7927870036099;-74.0248678700364
