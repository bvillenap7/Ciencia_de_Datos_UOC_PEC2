It was a very calm and peaceful shade of florescent blue or soft powder blue light To whom it may concern,  On approximately June, 1994 at 21:00 hours a girlfriend and I were at a Carnival in North Bergen, NJ. There was a crowd of people there but no one seemed to catch a glimpse of what my girlfriend and I saw that night. She tapped me on the shoulder and said “What is that!” I looked up to where she was pointing and there was a disk shaped object out in space.  It was a very calm and peaceful shade of florescent blue or a very soft powder blue light. It was a very clear night and I know definitively the unidentified object was out in space and not a hoax. It hovered there for about 20 seconds and as soon as I tapped my husband’s shoulder and asked him to look up at the sky, from the time it took me to tap him on the shoulder and the time he looked up which was only about a split second, the saucer left in a flash and instantly disappeared into space. My guess it was traveling the speed of light to disappear that quickly. I would say about 0 to light speed in approximately ½ of a second. I thought to myself how lucky I was to have seen it because most people have to go through life wondering if UFOs and life on other planets exists. Now I know the answer and I consider myself privileged to know. When my girlfriend and I tried to tell our husbands what we saw they just looked at us like we were crazy and then she dropped the conversation. I just kept telling everyone and did not care if they did not believe it. It was an amazing memory. This is the first time I am reporting it because I did not know there was a site where I could report such events. I just came across your site today.

Then I notice that it was moving  in a circular motion slowly but obviouse . From afar it seem like a helicopter but it was to far up in the sky for it to be a helicopter. It keep moving west of Hudson county with is just across from Manhattan New York.  I stood up and my wife said that she was also seeing another star like object which was also fashing  , I saw the second one she was taking about and also notice that there was a 3rd.  All of them align in a triangular formation.  I final notice the reason for the flashing of these object it was the reflection of the sun that was hitting these UFOs. ( I noticed this BC of the planes that were pasting by these objects and how they would also shine BC of the Sun)   The object kept moving West   and at one time on of them just shined with a burst of bright fire  and disapeared .... the last 2 continued to move West and final disapeared.

Huge bright blue slow speed flying disc shape object flew from Palisade Park to Seacaucus seen in NJ 00:45 am.;2009-11-05 00:45:00;4 mins;Huge bright blue slow speed flying disc shape object flew from Palisade Park to Seacaucus seen in NJ 00:45 am. The object flew from the north heading to the south.  It also flew at very low altitude also at very low speed.  The object has bright blue light and also has a white flashing light running in one direction on the body of the craft.  Comparing to the side of the normal aircraft, it was much much bigger. The craft has a disc shape and only one object was seen in the sky.  I was on the street and the yellow light shined on me.  The background of the craft was dark as the object was witness flying over the area of Palisade Park to Sycaucus area in New Jersey.;40.7927870036099;-74.0248678700364
Blinking red circular lights going in circle for almost an hour.;2013-11-06 20:20:00;>30 minutes;Blinking red circular lights going in circle for almost an hour. It's been flying in circle about 20 miles away from where we are, with red lights lighting one after an other in circle. At first we thought it was a plane and that because of the distance we had a distorted vision but then because of the route it took as it got closer we realised the lights (from far away we could only see 4 lights in circle one after the other) were definitely not those of a plane or a helicopter.  We waited to see what it did when other planes came close and the planes passed by as if there was nothing while it kept on following its elliptical trajectory... It's still there as I am writing this report, it is now 9 pm, it's been over 40 min. I would say it's on top of Secausus or Kearny, if anyone wants to take a closer look at it…;40.7927870036099;-74.0248678700364
