Another Triangular Formation in the skies of new jersey 3 glowing lights;2012-08-06 22:00:00;half hour;Another Triangular Formation in the skies of new jersey 3 glowing lights i recently read an article on http://www.realufos.net/ about these young ladies whom recorded a triangular formation in the skies of new jersey. I always tend to look up to the sky and I know where to see stars, because in Northern Jersey it’s hard to see stars.  When all of a sudden, I happen to look up towards the southwest direction west from NYC, I saw clearing 3 orb shaped white lights in a PERFECT triangle formation. I was convinced that it was a UFO of some sort.  They seemed to glow but no movement, and then I started to think maybe they are stars after all that I never noticed before.  But the formation was so clear I know I would have not missed it before.  So I went upstairs and had dinner 30min later it  was gone.  So now I’m convinced it was no stars.;40.7927870036099;-74.0248678700364
