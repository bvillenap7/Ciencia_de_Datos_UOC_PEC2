I Observed some balloons float by with the wind, then observed what looked like balloons that were red and white seemingly attached to each other, but they did not move or float across with the wind. I observed this first for about 5 min, then they disappeared. I went in the house for a few min. then came out and saw the sighting once again. I was amazed! They looked like balloons, but they did not move across the sky*. I observed the two balloons together again......They stayed in awkward rotation movement, but did not move in any direction. Then suddenly they detached from each other slowly and seemingly with purpose. They moved away from each other, Both rotated awkwardly in unison shortly...then disappeared.  * During this observation, it was noticeably windy.;40.7927870036099;-74.0248678700364
