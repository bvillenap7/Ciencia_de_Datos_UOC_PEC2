U.F.O.  observation.;2011-09-30 03:46:00;5 seconds;U.F.O  observation. As I was taken a night photo of a bright star, and when I lowered my camera, after taken the photo, I saw a falsh of round light suddenly in the dark sky, looking East from the west.  The object was circle in shape.It had two shades of color to it, in the middle it was dark black looking, and on the out shell it was a lighter color.  Also in the middle of it was a smaller dot of some kind, circle in shape,like something a U.F.O would have on it, or on a spacecraft,from out of this world.  After the light went out on it, I pionted my camera in the direction of the said object, and took a photo of it.  The photo showed what I just discribe above.  I believe I have a real photo of a real U.F.O. This is my secound report of two different U.F.O observations,that I reported to this site, this year ,and with in the last four months.Duly noted.;40.7927870036099;-74.0248678700364
While viewing the stars I saw a U.F.O  fly near by,in the from north to south,in New Jersey.;2011-10-25 04:00:00;6 sec;While viewing the stars I saw a U.F.O  fly near by,in the from north to south,in New Jersey. While I was looking through a pair of 12 x 50 binculars,up into the sky and viewing a bright star in the southwest, I suddenly saw a circle shape U.F.O flying by the star to the left of it, through the left side of the eye pice of the binculars.  I followed it heading south,and saw it turn left suddenly, and than back to traveling in a straight line,traveling fast.   I lost site of it in a haze of what look like clouds.  The u.f.o seem to be gray in color and had another rounded part to it in the middle, but I never saw any lights coming from it.  If the clouds did not block my view I could of viewwd it much longer, because of the speed it was going. This is the first time I got a good look at a u.f.o that close.  The time I viewed it was 4:21am on 10-25-11.;40.7927870036099;-74.0248678700364
the most panicking moment of my life;2020-07-20 22:37:00;5 minutes;the most panicking moment of my life First, I am a nature lover.  I have been seeing strange objects in the sky since June 27.  On July 20 at 10:37,  I came out of my house to smoke a cigarette and I looked at the sky in front and I saw two: circles of light with a light in the middle that turned on and off.  one moved towards New York and the other to the left.  Then the one at the left moved towards my street, I stood just under the canopy of my building and looked up and it threw a silver light to me.   I entered the building quicky and my body was shaking, I do not know how I went up the stairs.  I was petrified and it took me a long time to fall sleep.;40.7927870036099;-74.0248678700364
