My husband was looking West, towards Hudson County Park, when he claimed to have seen a ball of fire moving East towards New York...when I got to the window, it was gone.  I did not report this for three reasons: I did not know where to report it to, he does not believe in UFO's, I did not want to sound nuts.  There was an article in a local free paper.  I remember incidents reported in the park when I was younger.  Hence this report ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));40.7927870036099;-74.0248678700364
