I remember seeing lights over North Bergen, NJ;1997-06-01 01:00:00;1-2 mins;I remember seeing lights over North Bergen, NJ I am watching a show called The Unexplained on Bio.  This show is regarding UFO sightings over North Bergen, NJ.  If I had not seen this show I would never report or admit to seeing anything flying over anywhere. In 1997 I was on my porch in North Bergen, NJ with my mother and as we were chatting we seen a group of green lights that suddenly appeared over the street in front of us.  If this was a craft we did not see the actual body but the lights (about 8-10 orbs)were lined in a circular formation and perfectly oval shaped. The lights were perfectly stationary for about a minute and then suddenly, whatever it was, tilted on an angle and just as quickly as it appeared it disappeared.  I broke the silence by asking my mother if she saw what just happened and she said it was probably the airport or some type of light show. She was clearly shaken as she started to go inside. Neither explaination my mother gave me seemed reasonable since Newark Airport is miles and miles from North Bergen and light shows after midnight are not likely either, however, seeing UFO's is probably just as silly so ever since we've never talked about it.  I sometimes wonder what that was. Honestly, it is too disturbing to think that there might be someone/thing out there so I don't really think about it often.

Beam shoot towards park.;2007-11-24 01:45:00;.5 seconds;Beam shoot towards park While driving home and stopped at a red light on Bergenline avenue, facing east towards the river, I noticed two parallel beams shoot directly down towards the ground on my left.  I was taken back but made no mention to my friend who was driving at the time (I was in the passenger seat).  At the same time my friend proceeded to look up to the sky and lower the radio. At this time, I asked if he saw what I saw and he made mention that he only saw one beam.  We then drove through the James J Broddock park where the beams looked to have landed, but saw nothing out of the ordinary except an overturned port potty.

white and green lite hovering 20 or 30 feet over head. then ziipped away and disapeared after 3 or 5 seconds;2009-02-06 19:30:00;about 5 seconds;white and green lite hovering 20 or 30 feet over head. then ziipped away and disapeared after 3 or 5 seconds this looked like a small light.  Like a star only flying about 20 or 30 feet over our heads.  I was with my wife and just parked my car by North Hudson (Braddock Park).  As we were walking to our apartment we both saw this small light over our heads hovering and then zipped away like a shooting star.  Only it was too low and was impossible that it could be a star.  We bothed looked at eachother, and were like, did you just see that?  We debated on what it could have been.  I began to explain that I had seen something similar two times before.   The first time I saw something similar was in my a car with my friend.  It was about 1997 or 1998. We we going down 48th street in Weehawken, NJ on Blvd East that leads to River Rd. We both saw a green light same hight above, (20 or 30 ft), only the ligh was green.  The light looked like those firecrackers that shoot up and pop but this hovered and then zipped away exactly like it did with my wife and made no noise.   I saw it again in about May or June, 2008 riding bike with the same friend by the Palisades up by Edgewater, NJ. We had stopped to look at the N.Y. City skyline after riding up the long hill and both saw the green light hover and zip away.   I have never thought of reporting it because everyone takes these reports as a hoax.  I decided to report it after someone mentioned to me that there have been hundreds of reports in this area especially right by my house in North Hudson Braddock Park.  I have always known it to be 80th street park.;40.7927870036099;-74.0248678700364
Extremely bright light zooming scross the sky just disappears from sight;2009-11-21 17:40:00;5 - 10 secondes;Extremely bright light zooming scross the sky just disappears from sight My boyfriend and I were lying on the couch facing 2 different directions. I was facing the wall and he was looking out the window.  He was observing some type of white light in the sky moving upwards diagonally at a very rapid speed for about 5 seconds when he informed me to turn around.  When I looked out the window, I too saw a very bright light moving across the sky quite rapidly.   After I looked for about 3 seconds the light just disappeared out of the sky.  It was too small, moving extremely faster, and not the right shape to be an airplane. It was also too big/bright of a light to be anything shot up into the sky.  Nor was it a comet or shooting star due to the size being too large, the light being too bright, and there was also no tail at all.  It was semi-hazy and the sun had just went down not that much prior to the sighting, and nothing outside of our atmosphere could be seen at the time so it was definitely something leaving the planet.  It was a very nerve rattling event, since neither of us had ever seen anything like that before, and it was completely unexplainable.;40.7927870036099;-74.0248678700364
