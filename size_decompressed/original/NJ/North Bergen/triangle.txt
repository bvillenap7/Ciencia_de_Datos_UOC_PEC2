triangle spinning;2000-09-20 18:00:00;10;triangle spinning It was a clear day talking to a friend sitted facing the artificial lake in the park james bradock, when I notice a dark form over the three line what look like a plastic thras back turns out to be a black triangle with no lights, moving slowly and at low altitute,  when I mentioned that to my friend we stood up ,with my afghan dog by the leash after a couple of minutes of my skeptic friend asking what it was almost scare, the other witness got tangled with us,as he was walking and looking at the object at the same time, he was a white male blond, middle age, the comment was that it was probably a radio controlled model, I said I don't think so but it would be cool to have one!!.  Me and my friend tried to locate somebody with a camera to no avail.  We follow the object, and then in the middle of the lake started to spin slowly on its axis!!,  every 3 seconds more less , following and absolutely silent and straight path despite the mild wind moving the trees.  I had the chance to compare against the 2 passenger planes in the horizon,this after the object heading for Manhattan crossing the boulevard east,and the Hudson river, it was completely flat from below no protruding shapes, and absolutely majestic and spooky in its fly solid in the air. I have found that a lady saw it too in Rockland county,and reported it to jeff rense.com, while hiking she described mayan like designs and a hull on top this is because the exact date would be better known this way.
