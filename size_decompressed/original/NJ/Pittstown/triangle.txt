Diamond shaped shiny reflective ufo sighted in Hunterdon County, NJ.;2016-02-28 17:18:00;45 seconds;Diamond shaped shiny reflective ufo sighted in Hunterdon County, NJ. Sitting outside on my deck late afternoon after dinner sun was not set yet.  At first thought it was a silver, shiny Mylar balloon.   But, then it flew at high speed horizontally across the sky until I lost sight of it.  It had no lights but was reflective and it had no wings.  It was shaped like a 3 dimensional diamond.  It moved straight, did not float or waft, it moved steadily.;40.5951;-74.9573
