LARGE BRIGHT OBJECT HUNTERDON COUNTY NJ;2006-12-10 03:00:00;30 minutes;LARGE BRIGHT OBJECT HUNTERDON COUNTY NJ At about 2:30 AM on 12/10/07, I saw an incredibly bright object in the southwestern sky near the border of Hunterdon County NJ and Bucks County PA.  It was larger than a commercial airliner, and through binoculars it appeared to be a long, oval shape.  The light emitting from it was extremely bright, yellowish white, no other colors observed.  It was stationery, maybe 3 miles up. It appeared to be between 5 and 10 miles distance from my location in Pittstown, NJ.  It remained there for approximately 10 minutes.  I stopped viewing for about 2 minutes.  When I returned, I thought it was gone, but it had changed position dramatically.  It was now about 200 to 300 feet above the distant tree line, and was more to the north east.  I continued to observe for perhaps 15 minutes then, the object began a slow descent, and began traveling in a northwesterly direction.  It was still about 200 feet up, was following the tree line, and the brightness of the light had dimmed. I continued to observe until it was no longer visible.  This object, in my opinion, was not an airplane or helicopter because of the size, shape and dazzling brightness, nor was it a celestial body because of itâ€™s changing and deliberate course.
