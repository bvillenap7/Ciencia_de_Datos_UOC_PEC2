two beams of light high in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 19:50:00;15 seconds;two beams of light high in the sky While walking around the block we suddenly noticed a bright light high in the sky and our gaze was drawn upward to the southwest.  At first it looked like a single bright beam of light, then a second similar beam of light appeared briefly, then they both faded away.  It seemed to leave a round cloud of vapor that lasted for perhaps a minute before disappearing and leaving a perfectly clear sky.  The light beam was very high in the sky and we never did see or hear a vehicle.  We don't know what caused this but speculated that it could have been landing lights on a jet plane showing up in a jet  trail or the clouds. Or could it be the exhaust from a military jet (or rocket) going supersonic?  The beam of light seemed somewhat unusual in that it seemed to spread out more, almost appearing like a jet trail. The light beams seemed to point downward to the earth and the direction of movement seemed to be upward.  We get a lot of jet traffic in the sky from New York (JFK, La Guardia) and and Newark airports. But this was different than anything we've ever seen before. Usually their landing lights go out horizontally and don't spread out as wide. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));40.5951;-74.9573
Three orange lights moving around in sky.;2012-06-22 23:00:00;a few minutes;Three orange lights moving around in sky. I was driving home from work last night and saw three orange-red lights in the sky in a triangle shape.  I pulled over to watch and they were slowly moving around in different directions.  A few minutes passed when they each started to slowly disappear from view.  It was very strange I never saw anything like it before.  They did not move like any aircraft I have ever seen.;40.5951;-74.9573
