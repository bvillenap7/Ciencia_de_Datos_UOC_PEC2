Object may have landed in area that saw similar circumstances 4 years ago.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus?  PD));2010-08-16 21:15:00;TBD;Object may have landed in area that saw similar circumstances 4 years ago From approx 9:10 this evening to 9:27pm, 2 other witnesses and I observed an orange orb, low in the north west sky, which descended slowly, (approx. 17 minutes) and disappeared behind a tree line.  Through binoculars, it appeared to be perfectly round and pulsating.  The color would at times deepen to red, than back to orange.  The area where it descended is the same area in which I witnessed similar events 4 years ago.  A digital photograph was taken by one of the witnesses, but unfortunately, the object appears as a pin dot. This was also videotaped, but again, the object appears minute on the tape.
