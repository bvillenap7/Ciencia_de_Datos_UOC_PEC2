Large Bright stationary object over the atlantic gets attention from other aircraft.;2005-12-03 17:45:00;1 hour;Large Bright stationary object over the atlantic gets attention from other aircraft. I live very near to the ocean and have a clean view of the night sky. I was just leaving my house and out over the ocean, I saw a very bright star like object in the sky. It was enormous compared to the other visible stars in the sky. At that monment, I noticed other aircraft in the sky around this object. I thought it may be military planes given the fact that they seemed small and flew very quickly. One of these aircraft flew up to the object and shined what looked like a spotlight at it. Then it flew away from the object still shining the light as it headed south. This aircraft, I noted, had ONLY 3 red lights and may be a hint as to what type of plane it was. There were about 4 other planes flying to and away from this object that I could see. I took some photographs with a film camera and have yet to see what comes out. There was also what looked like a lunar eclipse (although I've never actually seen one before) It was just very eerie. My husband and one of my children also witnessed this. As far as altitude, I would guess that it was about 20,000 feet in the air. And would have been over the atlantic in the bayshore area between NJ and staten Island.
