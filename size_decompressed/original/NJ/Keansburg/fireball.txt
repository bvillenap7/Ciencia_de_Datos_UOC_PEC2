I went out on the balcony sometime after 10:40pm to try and catch a glimpse of the Persieds, as the night had cleared up enough for star visibility. Northbound, in between 8-9 o'clock from the direction of the rising sun in the area I spotted a bright orange light with the naked eye. At first I assumed it to be one of the bright Perseids fireballs, given the particular night.  However, it did not flicker out as expected and as it followed the normal trajectory of a meteor moving across the sky it slowed down and suddenly began to rise back into the sky.  It rose at a slightly faster pace than the one it had been falling at, and when it had traveled far enough (in between 10-11 o'clock from the direction of the rising sun) it stopped midair and hovered for about a minute and a half. Two aircraft right flew past it during that time, clearly identified as such by their blinking lights. The object itself also blinked, but not the way an airplane would - as it was entirely consumed in light its 'blinking' was more of a flicker, like a meteor. It was also completely silent the only sounds heard were those of the two planes that passed it. Shortly afterward it began to shrink/dim in and seemingly disappeared out of existence. I waited for about thereafter in case it returned - it did not.;40.4442;-74.1300000000001
Fireballs.;2013-09-28 22:30:00;30 minutes;fireballs A group of us saw and photographed a number of these small fireball type objects that came out of the SE towards the NW.  They seemed to come at random times but followed pretty much the same path and when they got to the same point in the air they just disappeared. We thought they were Chinese lanterns at first but after driving around towards the direction of their origin found no signs of anyone partying or having any celebrations.  There were no people on beach and it stopped after about 30 minutes.  It would be nice to know what they were.
