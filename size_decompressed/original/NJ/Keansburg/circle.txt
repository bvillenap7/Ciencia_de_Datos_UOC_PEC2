As it ;2002-08-08 02:30:00;under 20 seconds;I was outside with my dog, in NJ, when I noticed a white light through the trees. It was high up in the sky, but in the horizon. As it came out from behind the trees, it was white, & round (like a circle). Behind the trees, it was in the SW horizon. when it came out from behind the trees, it was in the southern horizon. It moved accross the sky, towards the East Coast. It didn't just fly accross the sky, but it curved upward toward the sky. About 2 seconds afterward it just disappeared. It didn't streak off, there was no tail. It was just gone! The object looked like a round, white light, moving accross the sky. It was not a plane!;40.4442;-74.1300000000001
