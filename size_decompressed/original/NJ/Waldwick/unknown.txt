My wife and I were standing outside our home with a neighbor and we witnessed a large bright glowing red object come out of the Northern sky, drop down approx. 200-300 feet above ground.  An airplane was over it's head and the plane looked like a pinhead.  We watched it move totally silently over our heads and disappear into the southern sky.;41.0157;-74.1312
