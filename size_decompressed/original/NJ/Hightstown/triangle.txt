Sighting in Hightstown UFO!;2009-01-23 11:38:00;60 seconds;Sighting in Hightstown UFO! Driving Monmouth Street Heading east, right above power lines and trees, slow moving air craft. Triangler in shape color dark grey, Charcoal or black. 2 white lights recessed under the air craft. No visable landing gear. Not noisey a slight humming sound. Stopped the vechicle to look at air craft and it was gone nothing visable in the sky a very clear day. Not a normal flight pattern for any aircraft in this area. Could this have been something out of McGuire Air Force Base and if so why flying just above house level in a quiet town?;40.266;-74.5216999999999
