Jersey shore sighting.;2016-12-01 16:30:00;2 minutes;Jersey Shore Sighting Three of my friends and I were on the Boardwalk heading towards Ocean Grove around 8:30 last night, and saw a very bright light in the sky over the ocean.  Two of my friends thought it was a plane and walked off.  Another friend and I stayed and watched it (it was sort of oval shaped).  It just stayed in place so it couldn't have been a plane.  Plus it was very bright.  Suddenly this large bright light became a pinpoint of light and then, in a split second, disappeared completely.  No noise at all.  Then just darkness.
