I saw numerous orange colored lights in the sky moving from south to north at medium to slow speed.  They appeared to be several hundred feet in the  air and moved off shore after getting directly in front of my building. As they climbed off shore they increased altitude until they were out of sight. It was a clear night with the moon clearly visible approximately 20 degrees above the horizon. They made no noise durring the event.  There were approximately 100-200 orbs involved in the sighting.  I am a naval officer an pilot with 20+ years of aviation experience and have never observed anything like this before.
