Unusual lights on Asbury Park Boardwalk as seen on webcam;2020-06-10 00:30:00;10 minutes;Unusual lights on Asbury Park Boardwalk as seen on webcam At 12:30 AM on June 10 I was awake, looking at my computer, I went to Asbury Park Boardwalk WebCam. I saw some shooting star as I thought. Then I saw a very bright light ,small ,come dashing in from the ocean and  moved about erratically. Then it disappeared , next three small white lights came into focus on the boardwalk, then they blew up in size to be bubble shaped with what appeared to be an interior bubble that was a little more foggy looking. It was shocking looking. And then they dashed off to the side toward the ocean. They should all be available for review on the WebCam if they Keep their film. Iâ€™ve called the Asbury Boardwalk Web Cam number but have not heard from them yet , I left a message.;40.2510000000001;-74.0504000000001
