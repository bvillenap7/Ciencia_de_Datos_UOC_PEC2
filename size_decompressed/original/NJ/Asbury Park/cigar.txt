Craft  was then seen rising slowly north of Convention Hall then travelling west at a very slow rate On Sunday evening, 5/24/98 a green/blue cigar shaped craft was observered travelling north to south, approximately 200 ft up and 50 yards off the beach from in front of the Stone Pony, on Ocean Ave. The object moved at a slow rate of speed, and disappeared behind a row of buildings on the boardwalk. My 14 yr. old son ran to me from the back area of the Pony( we had just finished hosting a holiday show/barbeque) and excitedly described the same object that one of the band members & I had just seen. We all kept searching the skies when the object rose very slowly from the north side of Convention Hall. It hung in the air for approximately 15-20 seconds before moving, what looked like, west. At this sighting we were approximately 3/4 mile away from it. It moved sready & slowly until our view was obscured by the incomplete Ocean Mile high rise building.;40.2510000000001;-74.0504000000001
