The saucer looking craft flew very low to the ground. There was flashing red lights on every side. These lights were not very bright but very much brighter then an planes lights. The craft flew horizontily in a spinning motion. This motion was not a fast spin but more like a rotation. It was hard to tell which part of the craft was spinning the outside or the inside. It came very close to hitting another flying aircraft which might have been a plane. A minute or so later there were many other flying aircrafts farther away probably planes however it was to far away to see. The object flew very slow and low to the ground,but still well above the height of our house, and lasted around ten seconds. After seeing the aircraft the house plumming backed up and the toilets started bubbling and no one could use the bathroom or run any water.
