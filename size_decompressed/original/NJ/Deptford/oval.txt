Strange-moving object hovering and making helicopter-like sound at night, but not shape of a helicopter;2008-07-30 21:45:00;5 minutes;Strange-moving object hovering and making helicopter-like sound at night, but not shape of a helicopter My wife and I were standing outside our home at 9:45pm when we noticed a mysteriously shaped object with many lights hovering in the sky about a half-mile away.  It was moving back and forth in strange rocking motion, and it made the sound of a helicopter.  I thought nothing of it initially -- perhaps something for the evening news.  But the strange movement caught both of our eyes.  All of a sudden, it turned and moved very slowly in our direction and flew directly over us.  As we looked up, it didn't appear to resemble the shape of a helicopter, but almost like a giant oblong boat.  Although it was night and we couldn't see it clearly, there didn't appear to be any helicopter-like propellers.  I would have to say that the lights were probably consistent with that of a helicopter.  Nonetheless, it scared the be-jesus out of the both of us.  We think it was an alien spacecraft of some sort, mimicking the sound of a helicopter at night in a suburban neighborhood in order to fool nearby onlookers.  Has anyone ever experienced/seen/reported a helicopter-like unknown object? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
