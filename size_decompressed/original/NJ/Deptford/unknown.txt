Magnificent ultra bright light/shape seen shining 10am in the sky north and to the east of downtown Philadelphia.;2018-07-02 10:00:00;30 seconds;magnificent ultra bright light/shape seen shining 10am in the sky north and to the east of downtown Philadelphia Me and my wife were driving through Deptford, NJ, heading northbound towards Philadelphia on highway 42 north when we both noticed a ultra bright light up in the  sky (due north) that appeared to be the shape of a rough diamond, it also was like burning or shining a really bright light in colors from yellow to pink.  I couldn't tell if it was moving or still because of the burning and shining I spoke of earlier.  The light reminded me of how sunlight is sometimes reflected in the windows of skyscrapers, but this light was very very brighter then that, there are no skyscrapers in that direction we saw the shape/light.;39.7512999999999;-74.9998999999999
