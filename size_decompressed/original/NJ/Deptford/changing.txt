Sparkling strings of lights floating in the sky.;2014-04-01 19:00:00;10 minutes;Sparkling strings of lights floating in the sky. While looking at the sky, I noticed what looked like a huge flock of birds that were a lot higher than I thought they could fly.   As my friend and I continued to talk it looked like they were flying towards us while changing formation constantly.   It wasn't until they got close enough to where normal birds would fly, we noticed it was strings of twinkling lights always changing shape.   They were moving from south to north.   Then we noticed a small baby strand coming from the opposite direction and just added to them.   I've never seen anything like it.   No one can tell me what it is that I caught on video and it's hard to see the sparkling since it's against blue sky.;39.7512999999999;-74.9998999999999
