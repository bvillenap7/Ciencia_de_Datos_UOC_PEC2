Diamond shaped UFO hovering in the sky witnessed by 8 people.;2014-04-16 20:20:00;15 minutes;Diamond shaped UFO hovering in the sky witnessed by 8 people. Very clear skies, saw UFO standing still, making no sound in the northern sky.  UFO  had very bright red and green lights  that were  pulsating.  UFO stayed motionless for at least 5 minutes, gradually moved down to the horizon till building (2 story High School) blocked our view.  Lost sight of UFO until it rose above the building , once again it stood still in the sky.While it was in the sky a plane from the west came close to the object.  The Philadelphia international airport is only about 6 miles to the west of our location.  I assume the plane may have been a commercial plane.   Suddenly UFO moved quickly across the sky heading southeast ,came to a stop then slowly moved back till once again it dropped out of view behind High School across the street.   All of us could not believe what we just saw. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I reported a sighting on the night of the 16th to your website.  The next day I started to review videos that were taken using iPhones.  On two of the videos taken, one 9 second long and another that was 48 sec. long, it appears to be another object moving about the UFO I reported.  I did not notice till I watched the videos,that there was another craft.  During the video the craft moves around the reported UFO, which at one point the UFO brightens as the smaller craft seemed to be right next to it.  As this was going on a commercial plane was coming from the west, as it neared the UFO's vicinity,the small craft swooped towards the plane and looks like it almost touches the plane The plane probably just took off from the Philadelphia airport.
