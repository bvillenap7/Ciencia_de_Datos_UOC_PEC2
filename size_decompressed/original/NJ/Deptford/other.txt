Black V-Shaped object that propelled forward while spinning/dipping;2015-06-22 10:00:00;2 minutes;Black V-Shaped object that propelled forward while spinning/dipping I was walking to my car at B & N in Deptford around 10 am.  I noticed a black V-shaped object approaching somewhat below the clouds.  It was either spinning or appeared to be shifting/dipping side to side.  I stood at my vehicle and kept looking up at the object.  I didn't know if it could be a drone?  It was pretty high up.  But the blackness of object was very dark/deep toned.   I didn't hear any noise emitting from the object.  I wasn't sure if it was something that fell off of an aircraft by the way it was not only propelling forward but spinning or dipping side to side.   I climbed into my vehicle not sure if it was some type of debris falling.  I then tried to locate it again by looking up through the car windshield, but couldn't visually locate object again.;39.7512999999999;-74.9998999999999
