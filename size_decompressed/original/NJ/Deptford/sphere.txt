While waiting to take out my telescope, I went outside to check the seeing conditions when I saw a rather bright green light (seemingly round), come streight down, as if falling form the sky. The light faded to white as it remained stationary.   I watched this object for several minutes, when it moved form side to side rapidly within about 1 degree.  The object then shot straight up, once again turning green as it went, until it was out of sight.  This was unlike anything I've ever seen in the sky, and I have been taking astronomical photos for a very very long time.;39.7512999999999;-74.9998999999999
My husband and I saw a slow-moving, low-flying, orange globe going over our development around 8:00 at night.;2012-10-12 20:00:00;10 minutes;My husband and I saw a slow-moving, low-flying, orange globe going over our development around 8:00 at night. While coming home from the store at about 8:00 pm, I noticed a low-flying, orange globe over my development.  I stopped the car and got out to watch the globe flicker as it moved slowly over the houses.  It did not seem high in the air.   I returned to my car and drove to my house and called my husband out.  He also saw it as it continued to move roughly eastward then finally faded into the distance.  It definitely was not a plane or a meteor.;39.7512999999999;-74.9998999999999
