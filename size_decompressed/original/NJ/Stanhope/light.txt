Two Flying Lights;2008-01-13 04:30:00;At least five minutes;Two Flying Lights My girlfriend and I were looking at the sky in our backyard when we noticed two lights flying around and around in a pattern, but going up and down as well.  They seemed to be too far away to notice where they were going, or what they were doing.;40.9217;-74.7004
Pair of lights seen hovering, or slowly cruising, over Route 80 West.;2009-12-30 19:00:00;<1 minute;Pair of lights seen hovering, or slowly cruising, over Route 80 West. My wife and I were traveling West on Route 80 and drove underneath 2 hovering lights blue/green-ish. The light placement was similar to an airplane. However, the object did not move but remained stationary, or cruised at such a slow crawl that it appeared to be hovering. We considered it might be radio-tower lights (of which there are many on the mountains in that stretch of road) but the lights were above us and the road. Our next thought was that it could be a helicopter, but there was no detectable blade noise and the distance between the lights was closer to an airplane wingspan it would have had to have been a bigger helicopter than I'm aware of in existence. I can't think of anything else that can hover or travel at such slow speeds besides a blimp...but how often are blimps even flown?...especially after dark and over a highway, rather than a sporting event?  It remained in our line of sight as we drove for approximately 30 seconds to under a minute before the road curvature obscured our view behind the treeline. I've waited this long to report it because I've periodically been checking this site, and similar reporting sites, to see if anyone else collaborated this sighting, to no avail. So, I guess I'll be the first to report it.;40.9217;-74.7004
