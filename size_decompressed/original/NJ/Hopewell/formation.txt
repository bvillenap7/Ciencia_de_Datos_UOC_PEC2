Sighting involving light formation and a mysterious vehicle;2004-03-22 20:00:00;10 minutes;Sighting involving light formation and a mysterious vehicle While driving on back road near Hopewell New Jersey, my friend and I spotted a formation of 4 lights, the bottom three all diagonal to the right, with the top brightest light off slightly to the left. We looked at the formation for a minute while it stayed stationary, and then the top brightest light began to move. It passed the car and changed position from the right of the car over to the left. Once we looked back at the remaining three lights, the next top one moved a little to the right, flew straight up, then disapeared into the sky. After driving a little while longer, we were shocked to find a number of blinking lights surrounding the car. After a short amount of time, the objects disapeared, and we noticed we were being followed by a mysterious car. The car's headlights were so bright it caused my friend and I to comment on growing head aches. When we slowed to allow the car to pass, it came to a stop, and eventually fell behind us. The whole event lasted about 10 minutes.;40.3952;-74.766
