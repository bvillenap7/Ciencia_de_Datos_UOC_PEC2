Estimate the object was 50-100 feet in diameter. Blueish pulsating light eminated from the entire cirular shaped bottom of the object. Very low frequency sound got louder as the blueish light pulsated brighter and sound got softer as the light pulsated to dimmer. Duration of event we was at least 30 minutes, perhaps longer. Observer 2 was very frightened. Observer 1 was indifferent. Observer 3 was very excited and interested. O3 eventually said to O1 and O2 that he thought it was a UFO and as soon as he said that the object vanished as if some one had turned off a light switch. At its brighest the object lit up the area like it was daytime.
