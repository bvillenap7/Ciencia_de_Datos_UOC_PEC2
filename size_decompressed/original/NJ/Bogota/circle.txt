Bright green lights in the sky.;2021-05-17 00:07:00;1-3 minutes;Bright green lights in the sky. My wife and I were on our back porch smoking cigarettes and having a conversation. I casually glanced over the top of my Nieghbor’s house and I saw at least 7 green dots in a perfect line and moving very fast across the sky. I yelled to my wife “look look look” she was in shock. She took my phone and took pictures. The objects were moving so fast they were very quickly out of our line of sight. We ran in the house and exited through the front door to get a better vantage point from the street. When we came outside there was 2 men outside my home talking (no relation). When the men saw how we came out the house and how we were reacting to something in the sky one of them asked me “ what are you looking at?” When I pointed it out he was in shock and started to take pictures his friend did the same. At this point the object were getting very far away and very small. The objects were bright green very bright constant green light no blinking. They were very close! together and in what looked like a perfect line. They were moving in sync with each other.;40.875;-74.0347
