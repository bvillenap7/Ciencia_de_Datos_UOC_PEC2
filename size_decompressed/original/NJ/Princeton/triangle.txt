lights seen in central NJ night on 3/12/09.;2009-03-12 20:45:00;30 minutes;lights seen in central NJ night on 3/12/09. On the night of 3/12/09 between 8:30 and 9:00 pm I was coming home late from work.  It was overcast.  I was heading in a western direction on  US 1 (south).  I was  turning in a shopping center to go to Walmart when I noticed some red/orange lights.   At 1st I thought it was a plane until I noticed a similar set of lights underneath at an angle.  They appeared to hover and then go back and forth.  This was strange and no typical of a plane.   I took my new G1 phone and tried to take a picturng fore.  It was dificult since not best camera. After taking several pictures, I spent some time looking  for the phone case.   When I realized it was getting late, I decided not to go to the store,but get something to eat.But the place I wanted to go on the other side of the shopping center was closed so it mus thave been after 9 by then. I got back into my car and headed in other direction on route 1 to go to a fast food  place.   I went to drive in window got my stuff and started heading back in western direction on US 1 south to 95 s toward my development.  It was now at least 20-25 minutes since I first saw the lights.  When I pulled in my devlopement Hopewell, NJ, the lights appeared closer. (Apparently, the sighting in the shopping center was at greater distance and the object(s) were actually closer to my home.)  When I pulled in my driveway, I again took pictures.  When I looked at them I coulnt see any thing on the shopping center photos due to the distance.  But 2 taken from my front yard show a bomber range or v-shaped object.   Based on the brightness of the lights at opposite ends, it appears the object was larger than a typical plane.  There was no noise.;40.3673173913043;-74.6411198757765
Black triangle over Princeton, NJ.;2015-08-19 22:20:00;5-7 minutes;Black triangle over Princeton, NJ. Observer background:  Masters student currently in 3rd year of coursework in the study or religion.  Familiar with some UFO literature. Initially observed what seemed to be a satellite, then realized it was moving in an impossible flight path (e.g. it did not move in a straight line, its speed was inconsistent as it sped up and slowed down).   I then further realized I was looking at a point of line that was connected to 2 other points of light, forming a triangle.  The triangle object was very large (looked about 4 inches across and not very high up--less than a 1000 ft., I'd estimate), black with shimmering edges, and its lights did not so much pulsate as they did shimmer as well.   Called friends to come see what I was looking at, but before they could arrive, the triangle seemed to break apart into 7-8 smaller lights and flew off at impossibly fast speeds, disappearing from view within seconds.

I was scheduled to interview prospective students by skype from China so I was driving to campus at about 5:30 am on Friday, Jan. 17, 2020 when I noticed a strange object in a jet black pre-dawn sky.  At first I thought it was clouds partially covering the moon, but the object was far too big for that.  I realized quickly that it looked like a huge floating platform just hovering in the sky above a large shopping center near my house.  It was black and solid, blacker than the dark winter sky, with white, and the occasional red and green lights irregularly placed around it so it looked strange and caught my eye.  Since it was off at an angle and above me, it wasn’t clear if it was a rectangle shape or a triangle.  It looked like a gigantic sound platform like you see at concerts but much bigger than that, hanging silently in the air.  As I drove down the road with the object hovering to my left, I could ! see that it was ridiculously huge hanging there, dwarfing the large shopping center below it.  As soon as I could, I pulled off the road, rolling my window down to hear any sounds.  I couldn’t calculate how high it was in the sky, but I’d say it was somewhere between where a helicopter would fly but well above the top of the shopping center.  It was much bigger than the center and had no sound.  I stared at it for 10 minutes trying to figure out what it was.  I’ve never seen anything like it.  Finally, it silently drifted off beyond the tree line and I drove off to work so I wouldn’t be late for my calls. The next day I googled to see if anyone else had reported this.  No one had, but there were 2 reports from the previous year of having seen a large triangle like that with similar lights in nearby towns at night. When I looked for images on google, the black triangle looked closest to what I saw from the ground. I’m sure I saw something huge and unusual early that morning.  I still can’t get it out of my head.;40.3673173913043;-74.6411198757765
