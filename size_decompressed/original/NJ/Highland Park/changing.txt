At once, I felt a feeling of deep calm and relaxation.  Almost as if guided by an invisible force, I walked out the door and stood on the grass, facing the three glowing spacecrafts hovering before me.  Welcome! I yelled, as the spacecrafts blinked at me.  Almost without noticing it, I began to float towards the craft until I was hovering before it's entrance.  The door opened as I hovered inside.  I then played cards with the Aliens and we bad breakfast together before we reluctanly bid eachother goodbye and went our separate ways.  The End. ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.
