The ring type object sat fairly stationary at an elevation angle of approx 50 Degrees at a compass position of 108 Degrees East. After taking a couple photos with a Nikon SLR camera with a 300M telephoto lens the object appeared to be moving slowly at a direction of 146 Degrees SouthEast. This object was witnessed by My wife and I, We contacted my daughter in Pennsville, New Jersey who also saw the same object moving at the same heading at a relatively slow speed. My daughter also found someone on social media from Hammonton, New Jersey, who posted two photos of this object with a sharper image.;39.7856;-75.2562
