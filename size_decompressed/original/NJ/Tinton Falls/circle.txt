Illuminated, circular object traveling at igh altitude, high rate of speed and increaseing in altitude before loseing sight.;2005-07-10 23:00:00;15 Sec.;Illuminated, circular object traveling at igh altitude, high rate of speed and increaseing in altitude before loseing sight. 1) Description I observed a round, orange illuminated, object moving south to north at high altitude, and traveling at great speed. It appeared to be gaining altitude before traveling out of sight. I thought it might have been a satilite or other explainable object until reading a similiar account posted from a town south of my location, and within the approximate time frame. This too was traveling parallel to the Garden State Parkway, as it runs North and South. I had observed only one object, and at the time the sky was relatively clear with a number of stars visible through the background light pollution. What had impressed me most was the color. The orange light appeared as if it was reflected sun light off a high altitude silver skinned aircraft though it was 23:00 hrs. 2) Obsever background 18 yrs.

Shaped flying saucer with brite multi colored lights blinking around it, then turns into grey blimp, then disappears;2011-06-17 00:00:00;10 minutes;Shaped flying saucer with brite multi colored lights blinking around it, then turns into grey blimp, then disappears On this particular evening all 6 of us witnessed a very large (Aprox. 1/4 an acre in size)circular space ship with bright multi colored lights flashing around the outside, it was very bright,  it almost looked animated and was directly across the street at the tree line, we also noticed that it was silent.   We all started to go for our phones to take a picture but none of us could find our phones.  During that short time it moved behind a tree and seemed to vanish, all we saw was a very dim greyish blimp, (no lights).   I thought maybe whatever it was shapeshifted or it was just an ordinary blimp rigged with fantastic lights to look like a space ship, either way we all want to know what in the heck that was because it was incredibley fantastic and real looking, my daughter was shaking and in a state of shock she was so scared.   I had to let some time pass before I wrote into the National UFO hotline to be absolutly sure that what we saw was for real and not imagined.;40.27855;-74.07565
