A blue/green neon like light object shined through the clouds. Traveling from the east to west at a high rate of speed.;1997-07-29 20:30:00;1-5 minutes;I was out side when a blue/green neon like light object shined through the clouds.   Traveling from the east to west at a high rate of speed, it did close to a 90 degree turn to the north, not slowing down.   I was talking with a fellow truck driver.  He said did you see that? I asked what?  That quick a second object took in about the same path.   With that, I pointed and ask it that's what you had seen, he said yes.  Upon that, he said he did not want to talk about it, and climbed into his truck.  I sat outside for some time but the 2 were all I would see.  It was huge my best guess about the size of a aircraft carrier. ((NUFORC Note:  Source provides not information about sighting.  PD));40.647;-75.0997
