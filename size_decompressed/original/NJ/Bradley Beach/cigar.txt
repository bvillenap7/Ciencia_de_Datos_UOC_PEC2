Cigar shaped object moving fast, southward from NYC.;2001-09-11 12:30:00;2 minutes;Cigar shaped object moving fast, southward from NYC. Today is February 12, 2003. It has taken me some time to actually believe what I have seen with my own eyes. On the day of the WTC attack, I went to spend some time with a cousin of mine and my wife at my cousin's residence in Bradley Beach, NJ. We could see the smoke from the fires in Manhatten and were all looking up at the sky, as most people were that day. We were astounded when we saw what first appeared to be an airliner in the sky, but our moods quickly switched when we realized that what we were looking at was much larger than a commercial aircraft. It was somewhat cigar/diamond/elongated shaped and appeared to be rotating like a football in flight. It was not anything that I had ever seen before, or since. The object was also moving at a tremendous amount of speed and I cannot say for sure if it was changing colors or if the rotation was causing the sun to reflect off of the hull in a brilliant white light. The object, from my best guess, had to be approximately 35 to 50 thousand feet up, and once it started to move southward, it moved with a speed I have never witnessed before. There was no sound, and I quickly lost sight of it. We had all thought that maybe it was some kind of military aircraft, but none like any of us had ever seen. And I have yet to see the military design an aircraft that large or that fast.;40.2012;-74.0031
