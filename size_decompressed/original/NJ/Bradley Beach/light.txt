Star-like light that moved in different directions, heading south, south-east and dissappeared.;1999-09-11 21:30:00;1 minute;Star-like light that moved in different directions, heading south, south-east and dissappeared. I was visiting my mother and sister and we were sitting on a boardwalk bench on the beach. Our heads were down as we all were munching on food. I looked up and saw what I can only describe as a HUGE search light shining on us from the sky. I said aloud,What the... and the light retracted into what looked like a bright star that did not twinkle. We all looked at this Bright Star for a couple of seconds and then it started to move fast. First, it moved in a horizontal direction, then it dropped down as if it were falling. Then, it moved diagonally upward, and then horizontally heading south, south-east and disappeared. It all happened so fast, but we didn't take our eyes off it. I have never seen anything unusual in the sky in my life. I have to say,THIS, was unusual. It moved too fast to be anything man-made(KNOWN),and it literally,made the hair on my neck stand up.;40.2012;-74.0031
