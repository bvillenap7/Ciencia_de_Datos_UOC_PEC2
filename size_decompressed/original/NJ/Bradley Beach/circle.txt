orange circles moving along side each other;2009-05-21 21:00:00;1 to 1--1/2 minutes;BRADLEY BEACH N.J MAY 21 2009 approximately 9:00 PM. My son and I witnessed Two perfect orange circles moving along side each other, moving  in the direction of  a large Air Plane. The circles were defined the center was not as orange and not  solid as the outer perimeter, they crossed each other twice then went out of site. We were still looking up and saw another like object moving across the sky in the other direction until out of site. The sky was clear we had  100 percent visibility. The moments were  fast & smooth unlike an Air Plane or beam of light. There was no light trail.They did not appear to travel in a downward direction. what are could they have been? THIS SIGHTING LASTED approximately 15 TO 30 SECONDS.;40.2012;-74.0031
