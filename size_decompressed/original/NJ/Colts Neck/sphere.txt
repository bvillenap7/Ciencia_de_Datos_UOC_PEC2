White orb floating in sky turns green and shoots away;2019-10-08 20:08:00;3-5 seconds;White orb floating in sky turns green and shoots away Driving in my car on rt18 north in New Jersey, near mile marker 17, at approx 8:08pm, on October 8th, 2019, I witnessed a white orb moving in the sky outside the driver's side window, it paused briefly, then transformed to an odd emerald green color, then shot across the sky instantly.  The movement of it was very odd, very jerky and sudden as it took off and was gone in an instant.;40.3029;-74.1828
