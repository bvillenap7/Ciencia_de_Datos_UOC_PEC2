Green glowing craft seen over colts neck high school;2019-10-08 20:07:00;30 seconds;Green glowing craft seen over colts neck high school I was driving westbound on rt 537 when I noticed a green circle or sphere in the sky at approximately 45 degrees up from my location, at 11:00 (just to the left of the direction of the road).  I was approaching colts neck high school at the corner of 5 points road.  It was specifically noticeable because there were other traditional aircraft in the background moving and this light was absolutely still.   Moments after I focused my eyes on it and started to slow down the car, it darted extremely quickly in a green blur toward the north/northwest.  I know it sounds cliche but it looked like the the enterprise going warp.   Dead still and then a blur for a distance and then gone.  Green.  Bright green.;40.3029;-74.1828
