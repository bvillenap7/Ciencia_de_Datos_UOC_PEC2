It was late at night perhaps in the morning around 3 am, when all of a sudden I started to feel a little light headed and distracted. I woke up from a deep sleep and saw that my sister was still sleeping pretty comfortably besides me. Like always my window blades were open and I remember that I could see the townhouses that were across my street very clearly. Then all of a sudden a flash of light, as big as my window, maybe a little smaller was right outside of it. It was so bright and I started to try to tell my older sister but she was still in a deep sleep. The lights were so bright and white and yellow. I went running up to my big window, not knowing wether my eyes played a trick on me or it was for real. By the time I was up to my window, the flash of lights or the oval or disk or whatever it was, was gone. I think it was in a disk or oval formation. The scary part of this event was that the next morning when I was heading to my bustop for school, my nieghbor, who usually walks with me to the bustop, said that when she was getting a glass of water in the middle of the night, she noticed wierd lights through her skylight window, and then she went and opened her front door and she saw a disk shaped object or something, then it dissapeared. She claimed that to me without me even mentioning the story to her before she told me. So the question is, is this a coincidence of both of us having a dream,but then how do you describe my nieghbor telling the same story I witnessed or did we both witness it for real???

Multiple flashing lights.;2014-04-06 20:30:00;5 minutes;Multiple flashing lights, all heading north.  One solid red light with a circle of flashing lights going around them, one flew directly over.   I seen it very clear while the others were in the distance, they were completely silent. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Irregular pulsing point source.;2019-06-09 21:39:00;~1-2 minutes;Irregular pulsing point source. At approximately 21:39 I witnessed a irregular flashing/pulsating point (sources). I was facing north the location was within two fingers width held at arms length of Deneb ~ 3 or so degrees.  (Very roughly I think this was 18 degrees above the horizon---using the same finger approximation).  - There was no periodicity I could make out (varying between 2 seconds per pulse up to 7).  - Each pulse began appeared as a light suddenly turning on, then either: (1) immediately turning off or (2) decaying over the course of ~1 second (or longer, I did not take a precise measurement).  - The location appeared to occasionally change/jump within about 5 degrees of angular separation (estimated by three fingers width held at arms length).  - The maximum brightness was nearly that of Jupiter at the time.  - This lasted for about 1 - 2 minutes since I first witnessed it.  Other notes:  - It's central New Jersey the direction I was facing was New York, the night was humid, there were light clouds close the source---in essence there was a ton of light pollution and visibility was mediocre.  Originally I thought the clouds moving were causing the pulsing behavior, but on further observation it was clear this was not the case.  Despite the light pollution I was able to see a couple of meteor-streaks.  - The sky was littered with planes lower on the horizon (Newark airport is extremely close), and---like any good summer night around 9pm---there were plenty of satellites (I saw ~20 over the course of an hour --- mostly east-west moving, some north-south(ish) some in the vicinity of the flash).  - Other than the jumping I described above, the source did not appear to move, even when flashing for long periods.  Granted, what I witnessed was close to the horizon so  that the apparent motion would be small, but I did not see any movement over the very long flashes, and satellites that passed through that vicinity were very visibly moving.  - Over the course of four years, I've seen two bright iridium flares in the same area on other nights---I'm pretty confident this was not that.;40.5256638443936;-74.3994524027457
