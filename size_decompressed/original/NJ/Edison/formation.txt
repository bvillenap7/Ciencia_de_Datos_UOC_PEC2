I noticed that the stars were real bright...at first it looked like the big dipper.    ((Spacelink satellites??));2020-03-26 05:50:00;10 minutes or more;I walked to my car to go to work and noticed that the stars were real bright...at first it looked like the big dipper.  I took a second look and realized that they were moving (I think south east) in a straight line across the sky.  Extremely symetrical.  One after another... I tried taking pictures but it was too dark for my camera to register anything.   Called my mother out to the porch and she saw the tail end of it.  I am not sure if this is related, but my cars temperature gauge read cold and my engine light went off...this happened ten minutes after the encounter.;40.5256638443936;-74.3994524027457
