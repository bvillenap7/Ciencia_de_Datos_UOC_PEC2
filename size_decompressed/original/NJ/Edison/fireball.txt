We were standing there looking down at the cities below us and my attention then went to the horizon towards the south and slightly west (ssw I guess).  I saw what looked like two moving stars in the sky above the horizon.  One was white in color the other red.   I pointed this out to my friend who also saw the sight.  The two objects were moving rapidly towards the ground.  When they reached the ground there was a flash and one of the objects flew rapidly upward and away, the other object had disappeared.  The objects were definitely far from our location, probably hundreds of miles away, if not thousands.  I was 22 at the time of the siting and have since lost contact with the individual that shared the experience with me.

2 Orange Fireball ufo with Nucleus Looking Centers travelling east to west as fast any  other aircraft;2012-08-12 20:35:00;about 2 mins;2 Orange Fireball ufo with Nucleus Looking Centers travelling east to west as fast any  other aircraft 2 Red/Orange Ord Fireball UFO, with Nucleus Looking Centers traveling as fast as an airplane. It was about the size of any ordinary aircraft travelling over Edison NJ. 2 strangers saw the unidenitified object with me when I stopped the car on a side street off of Oak Tree Rd. This took place at 8:30 or 8:45 at sunset. Only reasonable explanation are meteors or stars as these objects only flew straight across. There was no trail or tail behind these objects though. I don't believe in any kind of that alien crap or whatever I would just really like to know what I saw though. It could be something really simple. My only guess is that they were early meteors during the shower taking place later in the night.;40.5256638443936;-74.3994524027457
