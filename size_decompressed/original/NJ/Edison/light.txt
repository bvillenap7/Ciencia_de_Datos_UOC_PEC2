After 15 minut;1999-11-18 19:15:00;approx. 15 minutes;I observed an bright object in the sky with a glittering tail - nothing unusual you say, but it was traveling NORTHWARD. After 15 minutes while the object was hidden from my sight behind tall buildings, I saw it again and it was traveling parallel to the earth - tipping a bit northward without losing its llumination. I initially dismissed this incident until I read about the numerous sightings the next day - about a meteor shower in the MID WEST.  I still find it odd that a meteor would be observed in NJ, and a specific meteor would be traveling at a slow speed north-east for 15 minutes - the sighting I saw could have originated off the NJ coastline. which houses numerous military facilities. ilitary s- off the NJ coast near a military installation.before I dismissed it as another object - until I read the numerous accounts of odd sightings in the midwest.  This observance was from Edison, NJ at approximately 7:10=7:15pm. My husband and I and our 6yr old (and 18 month old) were driving home from my in-laws in Edison to our home in Colonia, NJ. As a passenger in the front seat, I looked out the right front window and saw an odd sight up in the sky.  A traveling, silent light, intense as the North Star ((sic)), was at an equal altitude of the plane traffic in and out of Newark airport, NJ. My husband said I probably just saw a shooting star but I've seen a few shooting stars in my lifetime and this was different. My 6yr old in the back right hand seat said it was comet (he didn't see it initally). For about 3 minutes we passed tall buildings near Metropark train station that blocked this unusual light's view.  After we passed the tall buildings, I looked up in the sky, not thinking it would still be there (I thought it was also a firework or a comet). However, the sparkling tail heading almost parallel to the earth, tipped a bit northward at the same altitude I originally saw it. My 6 yr old then saw it. My husband was busy driving and just saw one of the many airplanes that were escorting this object. The next evening I went to www.sightings.com,(as I do most every day) and read about all the articles where people in the mid west experienced odd sightings. My husband called me later in the day and said that it was on the news I probably saw a meteor - I can still in my mind see the strange object flying northward - When we arrived in our driveway, I saw about 6 (what looked like airplanes) surrounding this odd illuminated object. ... can a comet fly northward for 15 minutes? Can a shooting star fly northward also? Can a firework continue for 15 minutes without losing illumination or speed?;40.5256638443936;-74.3994524027457
LINE of LIGHT BOBS in early morn sky;2012-12-10 03:20:00;20 minutes;LINE of LIGHT BOBS in early morn sky Hi this is to report a STRANGE LIGHT that hovered in the early Morning sky on Mon the 10th, it was pretty cold so I stayed in my friends car looking for anything unusual in the nighttime sky, usual planes, satts and other stuff.  About 3:20 am I noticed a  whitish bright light that seemed to Hover in the South Eastern sky about 30 degrees off the horizon, as it drew nearer it became elongated  a bit brighter,  and would  change  and become more straight....I could blot it out with my thumb but best guess it was above the flight lanes of the air traffic going to Newark Airport.  Anyway, I dismissed it as any UAP but in reading that post from South Amboy, NJ  that day made me wonder just exactly what this LINE of Light was Event lasted about 20 mins or so til I went into garage  thanks...........;40.5256638443936;-74.3994524027457
