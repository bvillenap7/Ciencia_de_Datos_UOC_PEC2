Rotating oval object hanging in the sky;2003-12-02 08:52:00;3 minutes;Rotating oval object hanging in the sky I was aboard a NJ Transit northbound train on the Northeast Corridor Line, on my way to work. As the train pulled up to the Edison Station, I noticed a small white, oval object hanging in the partly cloudy western sky, approximately 30 to 40 degrees from the horizon. It was about the size of an aspirin viewed edge-on and held at arm's length. The object appeared to be slowly changing shape, like an egg rotating on its short axis. I could not tell if there was any sound because I was inside the train. The object blended in with the background enough that if you looked away, it would take a few seconds to spot it again. It appeared to be illuminated by reflection from the sun, and it stayed in the same spot as the train pulled away from the station. It did not look like a helicopter as I did not notice a tail.;40.5256638443936;-74.3994524027457
A oval shaped object silver in color flew behind clouds and never came out the other side.;2014-02-16 17:25:00;10 seconds;a oval shaped object silver in color flew behind clouds and never came out the other side I step out of my truck and was looking at the icicles on the gutters, when I noticed an object above the clouds moving at a fast rate of speed.   The object had no wings and the sun was reflecting heavily of the front of the object.  The object was silver maybe a chrome-like color with an oval shape and was a speck compared to the sun.   The object was moving on an angle heading  south west..after estimated 10 seconds the object flew behind the clouds and never came out the other side.   The cloud appeared to be roughly 30 yards across by 45 yards long (conservative estimate).   The sighting occurred around 17:00 hours on sunday 02/16/14.  In the town of Edison, Newjersey;40.5256638443936;-74.3994524027457
4 oval-like white crafts moving through the sky.;2016-10-18 12:20:00;2 minutes;4 oval-like white crafts moving through the sky. I was on a lunch break in a park nearby, I see planes all day long and these were most definitely not what I would consider normal 'aircraft'.  I noticed one seemingly very close to an airplane and thats how it caught my attention.  I looked a bit left and saw 3 more.  All going the same direction, the 4th one was lagging behind but I did see some kind of trail coming from it.  I believe they were so far up that they probably weren't near the plane I mentioned, but from my viewpoint it looked close to it.   Was hard to tell definite shape/color on the sunny day, they blended in the sky a bit.  Absolutely no wings or airplane like features.  But from where i was, definitely white and oval-ish.  Definitely 4, and I lost them while driving to get a better look.;40.5256638443936;-74.3994524027457
