I thought outlout, what the hell is that? then i was filled with fear. i thought out loud, that thing is following me, that thing knows me, that thing knows who I am, that thing wants ME! rolled up window, turned on radio, looked again, it was gone from view but I knew that it was now above my car. now filled with fear.   the next thing I knew I felt like i woke up at the corner on sunset ave, the corner of sunset and main st in asbury park where I lived. thought, how did I get here, thats funny, don't remember driving. when the red light change to green i went straight across main st. i had to go past bond, then turn right on emery (or visa versa) passed lake to corner then turn left on to fifth and park in front of apt.   when I turned past the lake i was surprised by big lights behind pine trees that took up a large space, couldnt figure out how all of that what ever it was fit. stopped car, rolled down window, air was crisp, clear and cold. I looked and couldn't believe what I was seeing. it was right there but unidentifiable. it was a big something, it made a low humming sound, it had red and green lights on it. i got scared and rolled the window up, drove to the corner, turned left and parkd in front of house. got out of car, looked toward lake. it was gone. i thought wow, what the helll was that. just then eyes were drawn toward sky, i had to bend way back to look at very huge object way way up in sky, but still close enough to observe. six or eight sides, dark brown, metallic, heavy. wondered how could it stay up there? red, green, white light, made no sound, wondered how something so big got from the lake to way up there in the sky so fast with out making any noise? windows went arou! nd. i could see in the windows. saw some people i thought. i was so afraid of it, i just looked at it and said out loud, take me I'm yours. and a thought came immediately into my head. said, we already took you. we are bringing you back. i ran into the house. it was getting light out. it only takes 40 minutes to get from edison to asbury park, but hours passed, at least four, i wanted to go in and call the police, but i passed out cold. in the am around 10ish i woke up ran down stairs looked in sky but it was gone. for a long long time after i heard high frequency sounds in my head, my intuitive power was heightened and to this day i have experiences numerous spiritual experiences. called police two years later. they had nothing to say. went to local hypnotist years later. said it was a dream (not). had other encounters since then. not afraid any more. consider my self lucky for having had the experience. i have not been the same since. the experience changed my life. not business as usual. i noticed paramus 1978 had similar experience. okay. i know that i am not alone.;40.5256638443936;-74.3994524027457

YES, I SEEN THIS OVER EDISON,NJ NEAR NEW BRUNSWICK WHILE WALKING WITH MY KIDS I TOOK IT AS A SHOOTING STAR HOWEVER IT WAS SORT OF ODD LIKE YOU SAID IN YOUR POST....IT HAPPENED IN SECONDS... SHOT ACROSS THE SKY & DISAPPEARED.  I REMEMBER IT WAS ON HALLOWEEN EVENING NEAR DARK. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE OUT ON HALLOWEEN I AM SURE WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO SAW THIS. THOUGH DURING SEPTEMBER THROUGH NOVEMBER 2005 I DID SEE MANY SHOOTING STARS OR WHAT I THOUGHT WERE SHOOTING STARS IN MY AREA.  BUT THIS EVENT THE OBJECT WAS SO BRIGHT & FAST.  I CAN ONLY SAY IT WAS A FIREBALL WITH SOMETHING ODD ABOUT IT. PICTURING THE INCIDENT OVER IN MY MEMORY, IT WAS EXTREMELY FAST & INSTEAD OF IT DYING OUT IT ACTUALLY LOOKED LIKE IT LEFT THE PLANET.  NO JOKE.  HOPEFULLY NUFORC CAN EXPLAIN WHAT IT WAS.... OKAY JUST LETTING YOU KNOW I SAW THIS OBJECT TOO!   I APPOLIGIZE THAT I CAN NOT BE MORE DETAILED.  THANKS;40.5256638443936;-74.3994524027457

It was no airplane or other Ã§raft the object took on a golden hue and would flare then diminish in brilliance only to flare  up again and again and below the H shape was a row of curved lights in less intensity..went on for 3 mins or so too far to get a good pic but it was odd.pilots in final approach to Newark airport should have a good view of it. Really wierd looking;40.5256638443936;-74.3994524027457
