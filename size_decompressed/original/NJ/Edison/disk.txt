Many years have gone by without me mentioning it at all however, now in my adulthood, and starting about a year or so ago,  I have come more open to discuss what I and others witnessed and the feelings it left me with. I was 12 years old.  My mother and I had gone to Woodbridge mall.  After time spent at the mall we left and started driving back on route #1 South, towards the older Menlo mall. After passing the light on Ford Avenue I seen what I thought was a blinking star very high up in the sky just as you would normally see a twinkling star.  As we continued driving, I kept watching the star and to my surprise, it seemed like it kept becoming more visible. I told my mom that it was following us and she told me don't be silly.  It's just a star.  As we approached the next light, it was clear that this was not a star, but something else.  At that point it also gained my mom's attention.  We decided to wait until our turn off exit on N. Lafayette Rd., whereas there was and still is a 7 Eleven store.   We, along with other people, stopped in that lot, while others, including police officers, pulled off along side of route#1.  The exact location where 'White Castle' stands today.  It was apparent this was a craft and now extremely clear to see.  It kept descending until it reached maybe 200 ft above and just hovered there.  I remember everyone getting out of their cars and looking up at this massive round craft.  The strange thing for me was that after a few minutes, no one said anything and we just stood and stared at it.  It rotated ever so slowly with a very slight mechanical hum.  It had a row of 'White lights' and a row of blinking lights which I shall say were similar to that of the kind of lights you would use for Christmas. What we all seen next was amazing.  As it turned almost completely around, you could see what appeared to be an observation widow with beings just watching and pointing at the crowd.  Becouse of the distance, you could not really see facial structure but could see that these beings were human like with blondish color hair and a blueish light as a backdrop from inside.  Still no one said anything. Even I remained Quit. It's hard to say how long this occurred but in my mind it seemed like forever. In reality I guess 15 maybe 20 minutes.  Then this craft began to raise up higher and as if suddenly, everyone got back in their cars and just drove away. It left me with a very satisfying feeling which I'll say was spiritual like. What I don't understand is there was NEVER any mention of this anywhere as my mom looked through many local papers at the time and found nothing.  Now many years later there is still no mention except for someone who filed a report in this same agency and documented it 7/20/1974.  However, what I seen very clearly did NOT spin on its side, turn upside down or etc.  I hope and wish someone else will come forward as there are definitely others who witnessed this but will not speak about it.  WHY?  Please come out and file a report.  It is a happening which should be known.....I feel, possibility these beings had communicated with us (all of us who seen it that night) telepathically because there was an absence of lost time as the entire event felt much longer then my listed 15/20 min. I need to say this, there was never any frightening feeling.  The feelings which it radiated were very enlightening as I've stated above.  Although, I've felt these feelings then during my youth, they have indeed become more evident within these past few years and I don't really know why.  Again, I hope others will speak up about this event.  It happened, I was there and happy to have been a part of something simply amazing and Spiritualâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.

I look up and in the sky in the derection we are driving is a saucer shaped object.  It was white with little blinking lights around the underside. (red,white flashes) It looked huge! It was hovering slowly back and forth not moving like any plane or helicopter would be. And the size!  I have never seen anything that large in the sky before.  We drove toward it for awhile and then we turned off the road.  We thought it too weird to be a real UFO. But I think we are in denial.  I truly believe we saw a UFO now that I know (from this site) that others have seen similar things.  I can sum it up in one word, wow.;40.5256638443936;-74.3994524027457
UFO seen in Edison NJ USA up close;2008-06-14 01:00:00;5 mins;UFO seen in Edison NJ USA up close It was on the night of Friday 13th June 2008. I had just gone outside for a walk (sometimes I do this but never ever had I seen something like this before). We live in a town house complex. I saw a disk shaped object black in color with 3 sets of lights, two on top, two on the bottom and two on the back or side. Lights were yellow and red and they were flickering. It was surprisingly very close to me and so it appeared to be humongous. It looked like it wanted to land and the entire object looked like it was coming down at an angle of approximately 45 degrees and it then would change its angle of dip until it was horizontal(in a very hi-tech manner). It then would wiz I.e. move fast and makes abrupt stops. I thought it was going to land somewhere near by and I continued to pursue it. I was very scared. I did see a few cars on the road. But I have no idea if they spotted the same thing. I also must mention that I saw an airplane above it and it was quite far away in the sky as opposed to this object I saw. I can say that this UFO I saw was approximately the length of maybe 3-4 airplanes (nose to tail) and maybe the height of 1(i.e. distance from nose to tail again).;40.5256638443936;-74.3994524027457

I was driving on 287 around 3:45-4:00 AM coming home from a Labor Day BBQ/Party. When I looked up in the sky and saw six white lights in a semi-circle, with red lights on the top and the bottom. I was thinking it was a few lights too many for a plane but I didn't think much of it. I looked up again not more then 5-10 seconds later and it was gone. Between the extra lights and speed of which it disappeared made me think that &quotHey maybe this isn't a conventional aircraft&quot;40.5256638443936;-74.3994524027457
