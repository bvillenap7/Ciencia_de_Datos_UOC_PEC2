A low flying blue orb perfecly maintaining altitude and speed silently zooming acorss the sky.;2013-12-09 20:00:00;5-10 seconds;A low flying blue orb perfecly maintaining altitude and speed silently zooming acorss the sky. 	What I had seen was an orb, perfectly spherical and blue.  Not emitting a glow, but a completely self-contained light that encompassed the entire orb.  It was faster than anything I had ever seen before but it did not accelerate, decelerate or gain or lose altitude.  It stayed completely consistent in all aspects of movements.  I was in my back yard at about 8:15 PM est. when I saw it zip across the sky from North to south in an arching path.  It didn’t fade away, it continued across the sky extremely quickly until it was out of view.  There were low spotty clouds that may have covered it from view but I saw it perfectly through them.  They didn’t affect my view of it.  The object couldn’t have been more than 1000 or so feet above the ground (still some clouds lower than it).  After I brought it up to a trusted relative, he said he had seen the same type of craft in north Jersey only green 	This was like nothing I had seen before and I hope others saw it as well.;40.5256638443936;-74.3994524027457
