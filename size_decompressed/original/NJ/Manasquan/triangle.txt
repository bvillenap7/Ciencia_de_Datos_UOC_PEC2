VERY LARGE triangle shaped craft;2004-07-01 21:30:00;15 seconds;VERY LARGE triangle shaped craft first, the above date i know is incorrect. there was a reported sighting of a triangle shaped ufo over England a few minutes before my sighting. i was sitting on my patio, looking east at the night sky ( always watching for meteors ) when a VERY LARGE black triangle shaped craft flew through the sky where i was looking. it came from the east/northeast and turned towards the south/southeast. the craft had no visible lights AND for a craft that size, made no sound of any type. the craft was large enough to visually block the night sky above it. the only reason i saw the craft as long as i did was due to its long slow turn to the east/southeast. the craft was longer than it was wider by maybe a four to one ratio.it is hard to be accurate, as large as it was, and knowing it was several thousand feet in the air, i would be hard pressed not to say the craft was several hundred feet long my wife was in the house and i told her what i just saw ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));40.1201;-74.0594
