Was sitting on patio in backyard. Beautiful, clear night. Saw something flash by. At first I thought it looked like a low flying drone. Flew straight across yard, horizontally. Looked like it was right above neighbors house, skimming tree-tops. I thought maybe it was a drone, but it was very fast. Looked more like a meteorite, or shooting star. It made no noise, but did leave what looked like a dust trail of light. But it was a perfect straight shot horizontally. About 20 minutes later another one flew by on the other side of the backyard. I jumped because what are my chances of seeing 2 shooting stars in 1 night? I was also confused because it looked like it was so close to me (right above house). Then a 3rd one shot out across the yard. Over the span of 45-60 minutes I saw 3 of them. Could it have been meteorites? Space trash? Would that fly in a horizontal line at a constant speed?;40.9613;-73.9885
