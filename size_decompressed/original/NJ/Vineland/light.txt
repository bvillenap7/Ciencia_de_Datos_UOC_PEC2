I live in the woods. i went out to smoke a ciggarette and saw what looked like two bright red lights in a vertical shape, similar to a semicolon.  It flew over the trees slowly and it appeared to be close to the trees, but not big enough to be that close.  It did not make a sound...it was a very quiet, cold night.  This is the first time I've seen something like this.  I am a star watcher and I am familiar with the night sky...this was unusual. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.
