Moving stars in the night sky. viewable sun like formations.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of stars or planets.  PD));2008-09-10 04:00:00;all night;moving stars in the night sky.  viewable sun like formations nightly sightings of lighted objects stationed in the sky.  For hours at a time.  They also move a lot.  Sometimes if you look long enough what seems to be a regular plane appears in the objects place.  Various lights will start to blink like a regular air craft.  They look like stars in the sky as they shift from place to place.  They show up in the evening and at night sometimes most of the night.  Sometimes they emit bright lighted objects to the side which disappear.  One sighting in particular I set up a space telescope to view one the objects and witnessed a white sun like object.  It was all whitish and had plumes emitting from it like a sun. It was viewable for 2 or 3 nights and then was gone.  Everyone sees these things no one says anything.  I think I must have stepped into the twilight zone cause these sightings are so bizarre to normal air traffic that it's painfully obvious they are not real airplanes. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of stars or planets.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.4778827586206;-74.9923827586207

The light was bright, did not move until it shot upward & vanished. Around 12:17 am my boyfriend and I were outside his home. He was the first one to point out there was a “red dot in the sky”. I then looked up and saw the same thing. We both saw a circular red light in the sky that was not moving. This light looked very different from airplane lights and stars. This light was steady and did not blink. It also was red and seemed larger than a star in the night sky. I quickly took a Live Photo on my iPhone camera. I then started to record a video. While I was recording this video the light began to move and quickly shots up into the sky and disappeared. There were no clouds out either. This whole experience was no longer than 2-4 minutes.;39.4778827586206;-74.9923827586207
