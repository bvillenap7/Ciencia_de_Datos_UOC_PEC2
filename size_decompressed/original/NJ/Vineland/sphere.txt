Two white objects relatively close to each other travel towards philly in silence and synchronicity.;2007-02-03 10:18:00;3 min;Two white objects relatively close to each other travel towards philly in silence and synchronicity. I saw two objects extremely far away that were above the horizon, but below the clouds. The two objects were perfect white, and even though their distance from me was great they appeared to be spherical. They looked as if they could be small private planes, but there was no trail left behind them. And they were too close to each other for a normal flight. They were traveling away from me, heading north towards Philadelphia. They one object faded in the distance leaving the other alone in sight for another minute. The objects, when first seen, were traveling east, and then faded to the north.  They seemed to have great speed and left no trace or stream behind them. NO noise was heard.
