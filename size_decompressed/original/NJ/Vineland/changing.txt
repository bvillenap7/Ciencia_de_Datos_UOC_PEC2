Couldn't tell if it was a star or plane at first but then noticed two small lights, like tiny cigars moving around each other.  I ran in to get a pair of low powered binoculars and noticed it grew into more tiny cigars. Then it faded before growing back.  It changed to look like the rainbow halo cast from a crystal in the sun.  Noticed a small green orb hovering between the 11 o'clock position to the 6 o'clock positions within the rainbow halo.  It faded again where it stayed until it disappeared.;39.4778827586206;-74.9923827586207
