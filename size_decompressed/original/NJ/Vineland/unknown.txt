Two shapes see descending toward earth.;2014-11-22 12:30:00;~5 minutes;Two shapes see descending toward earth I was driving from doing a couple of errands when I spotted something moving downward at a 45 degree angle to the left of the sun - I was wearing polarized sunglasses which helps with the sky detail in the daytime.  I pulled to the side of the road where I saw the object creating a rounded V-shape as this object descended at the 45 degree angle.  I took a quite of few pictures of this object when I noticed another object moving in the same direction, same angle as the first object, and moving at the same speed.  The objects left a small trail behind them which dissipated - unlike a chemtrail or a meteor trail.  What caught my attention as being different was the rounded V-shape emitting from the nose to around the object as it move down in a 45 degree angle.;39.4778827586206;-74.9923827586207
