4 Red lights in shape of a square float over Avalon.;2014-07-25 01:00:00;5 minutes;4 Red lights in shape of a square float over avalon We were sitting on the beach and we saw four red lights in the sky, in the shape of a square, fly over us very slowly, it was not a plane or helicopter because no likes were flashing.   Coincidentally I spotted two shooting stars go by about 20 minutes before this.   We eventually looked away and it disappeared.  It wasn't traveling in a straight line, it was sort of wobbling a little bit as it if was being affected by wind. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));39.0955;-74.7272
