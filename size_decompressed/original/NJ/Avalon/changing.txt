I experienced them first on the same coast of NJ about 3 years ago. Mulicolored rapid flashing lights( Have Video). I pointed them out to a friend two nights ago and they were amazed. Early this morning 3 am we were hooking up on the beach and all of a sudden this bright looking star grew out into what looked like a hand very large lights on the finger tips with a luminous glow. It seemed very close to us. It lasted a few seconds. we ask each other did you see that? we saw an amazing show after that the multi colored ones seemed to be communicating with each other and the larger bright one  they would flash different sequences. move rapidly up and down and/or side to side. One even took off across the sky looped around the disappeared. One may have even been near or in the water. It almost seemed like there may have been two different types of ufo's. It also seemed we were being watched.;39.0955;-74.7272
