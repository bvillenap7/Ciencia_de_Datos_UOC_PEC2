We were sitting on a deck overlooking the ocean. Four bright, circular lights suddenly appeared over the ocean in the northeast corner of the sky.  Objects were arranged in a straight line and appeared in the sky for about 20 seconds.  They then blinked out.  About 30 seconds later three of the lights re-appeared about 20 degrees further south.  They were also in a straight line and lit the sky for about 20 seconds.  Then they blinked out and did not reappear. This event was witnessed by two other friends and me.  During both appearances, there was no sound from the lighted objectss at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.0955;-74.7272
