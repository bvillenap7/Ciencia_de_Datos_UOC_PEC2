Star like object  moving while watching Nasa's Anomalous Transport Rocket Experiment (ATREX);2012-03-27 05:20:00;2min;Star like object  moving while watching Nasa's Anomalous Transport Rocket Experiment (ATREX) While is was watching NASA's March 27th,2012  - Anomalous Transport Rocket Experiment (ATREX)at about 5:20am, I seen a star/orb like object (I've seen these exact objects many differant times in the past)move from the north towards the area where nasa's experiment was taking place, it was moving slow and then started to fade away while going on a south west direction, it was going towards where the first two rockets were fired.  The object looks like a star/orb but moves, had no blinking lights and seems to be very high up, there is no way it's a plane, satellite or meteorite..  It was visible for about 2 to 3 min....Im going to get a camera and start to document these objects, i see them alot..;40.5738;-74.4974
