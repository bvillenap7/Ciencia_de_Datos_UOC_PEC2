Fast moving black dots.;2015-01-23 15:24:00;20 seconds;Was looking out my window facing south and seen 2 fast moving black dots VERY high up in the sky moving extremely fast..  There is NO way this was a plane or birds...  These 2 black dots moved from east to the west and covered the whole sky in I would say about 20 seconds, they disappeared when they went above or into very high clouds..  The speed they were moving is something I have never seen in my life...   The Weather is about 34 degrees, no wind, blue sky to the east, clouds to the west.... One more detail, when these black dots were moving there seemed to be not much space between both objects and they stayed the same distance from each other the whole time..;40.5738;-74.4974
