UFO with white light and green (ultra light) moved slowly downward on a diagonal path, then disappeared.  ((anonymous report));2019-08-23 00:17:00;1 minute;UFO with white light and green (ultra light) moved slowly downward on a diagonal path, then disappeared. I was getting in my truck to go to work.  Truck was running but the lights were off.  Noticed an aircraft in front of me pretty high in the sky.  Another aircraft slowly came in from the left and moved on a diagonal path downward.   There was a white light on the right side of the ufo and a bright green light on the left.  I could not stop staring at the green light.  Object was moving slowly but I still saw trails from the green light.  In my head I jokingly told myself that might be a UFO.  Just then, it either vanished, or took off super fast.  All that was left was a green hue in the clouds.   On my way to work, I saw at least 10 aircrafts hovering in the sky.  Some were helicopters  but at least three of them had huge panel lights on the front and looked like airplanes hovering.
