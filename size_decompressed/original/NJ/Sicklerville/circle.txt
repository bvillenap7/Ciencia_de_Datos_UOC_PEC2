9 obects total low altitude, eastern skies, vanishing in series one at a time.;2013-09-15 01:15:00;3 minutes;9 obects total low altitude, eastern skies, vanishing in series one at a time. Saw a formation of 8 objects, set in pairs, then another from the right.  my friend was leaving at 1:20 am and called me seconds after he had left, telling me to get out here now, i went out looked east and saw a glittering glowing orange/red (looked like a lava lamp) series of lights slowly separating, but staying in pairs, 8 total making a formation.  they all spread out and then literally dissipated and vanished one at a time starting from left to right, then all the sudden from our right comes from over the houses a bright larger version of what we saw came over where these 8 objects had vanished and hovered there then it too vanished slowly flickering out, it moved strange very jerky movements but maintained a bee line for the area where the others disappeared.  no noise at all and it was dead quiet in my neighborhood.   Ive researched this site and there appears to be an actual ufo flap going on in our area, look at the recent sightings in south jersey, all the same, i was suprised to also read people saying that it has been happeneing nightly.;39.7354;-74.9838
