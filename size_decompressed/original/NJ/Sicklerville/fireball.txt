8 Formation fireballs with 2 distinct lights IN each one then a 9th that came later.;2013-09-06 01:23:00;3 minutes;8 Formation fireballs with 2 distinct lights IN each one then a 9th that came later. Saw a formation of 8 objects, set in pairs, then another from the right. My friend was leaving at 1:20 am and called me seconds after he had left telling me to get out here NOW, I went out looked n/nw and saw a glittering glowing orange/red series of lights with 2 DISTINCT what I can only describe as headlights inside EACH of the 8 fireballs slowly seperating but staying in pairs, 8 total making a staggered like teeth formation across the sky about a 1/2 mile wide formation.  They all spread out, moved towards us and then literally dissapaited and vanished, then all the sudden from our right comes from over the houses a BRIGHT larger version of what We saw came over th where these 8 objects had vanished and hovered there, it moved strange very jerky movements but maintained a bee line for the area where the others disappeared the the large one did just what the other 8 did and slowly flickered out then vanished.  NO NOISE at! all and it was dead quiet in my neighborhood. It was soo eerie looking in the BLACK sky.  Now at 2:5 am the are where the objects were is all cloud covered now.  I've researched this site and there appears to be an actual ufo flap going on in our area, look at the recent sightings in south jersey, all the same I was suprised to also read people saying that it has been happeneing nearly nightly.;39.7354;-74.9838
