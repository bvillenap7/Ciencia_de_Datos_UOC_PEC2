I noticed in the sky this Triangle Yellow Light moving slowly around a little forest that we have between our complex (Asten Woods).  I stopped the car on Dittest St to look at it. The Triangle also stopped and stayed in place for about 2 minutes. Then,the Triagle light disapear/faded away (leaving a little circle of small lights) but there was still something there - I kept looking around, but now there were cars behind me - so I had to move.   I went and picked up my daughter and in the way back home - when I turned into Erial & Williamstown Rd - I could see the Triangle Light again - I asked my daughter do you see that Triangle in the sky she said yes. It moved from the area that I saw before and it crossed the road that you were in and then it disapear again in the open clear sky. The Trianle Light was yellow and when it faded it seemed to had little lights in place of the big Triangle Light.;39.7354;-74.9838
Triangle with Aura, Blinking Red and White lights.;2015-04-11 22:00:00;22:20;Triangle with Aura, Blinking Red and White lights. I first saw the craft while I was out in my backyard with the dog, I saw odd blinking lights.  I then went out front with my daughter.   One red one in the front of the craft and three white in the back of the craft.  The red one blinked and then the two white ones on the back corner, then the red one, the the white one in the middle of the back.  Then the two corner ones went out completely and only the red and the middle white remained alternately blinking.  There was also a black aura around the craft.;39.7354;-74.9838
