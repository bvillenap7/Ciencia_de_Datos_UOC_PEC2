They seemed to be active, moving,  pulsating moving jerky with a slight up and down movement. When he called me pounding on the window to come see them I ran out and saw at least 6 myself. I tried filming them on my iPhone only to realize I did not have the video on so I only got a still image. I did call the police. Did not seem to be interested only to say do you want a policeman to come out. at that point they were gone from our view.;39.7354;-74.9838
