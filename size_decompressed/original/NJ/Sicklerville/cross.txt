White beaming lights;2019-07-30 22:55:00;1 minute;White beaming lights This evening my boyfriend and I both saw a object which at first looked like a air plane crashing down.  After getting closer to it we saw beaming bright lights and it was hovering over the technical school in sicklerville.  We turned around to see if we could see or take a picture but it was already gone.  It was spotted for about 40 seconds.  It had orange and white lights and looked like a X.
