Bright white lights flashing then faded away with an orange glow;2012-07-30 01:00:00;30 seconds;Bright white lights flashing then faded away with an orange glow.  I was watching T.V. and I noticed flashing lights coming from outside.  I assumed that there was a police car out in my street. So I looked out the window.  I saw white flashing lights on, or right above the road in front of my house.  These lights were blinding like a strobe light.  It then became a solid white light that faded away abruptly with an orange glow. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));39.7354;-74.9838
