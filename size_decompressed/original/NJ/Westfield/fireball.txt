Orange fireballs in New Jersey heading northeast.;2010-08-14 20:10:00;15 minutes;Orange fireballs in New Jersey heading northeast. At about 9:10 p.m. on August 14th, 2010, my two friends and I spotted 10-15 glowing orange fireballs going in a northeast direction.  Location was Westfield, NJ (zip code 07090), and it appeared that the fireballs were heading toward New York. They appeared one after another for about 8 minutes, with two or three following about 10 minutes after that. The first couple appeared to be going as fast as helicopters, but flying at the apparent same height as airplanes. They also appeared to fade out once they reached a certain point, though we couldnâ€™t tell if they were just going behind clouds or actually fading away.  They had no tail.
