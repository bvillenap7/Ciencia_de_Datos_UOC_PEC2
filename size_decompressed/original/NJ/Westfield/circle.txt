It was fast -- it took all of 2-3 seconds, I've seen my share of shooting stars  -- this was diffrent -- smooth -- no tail. My son, who is just learning to talk,  even commented wow. It was midway up in the sky looked at least ten miles away -- If I would have blinked -- I would have missed it. see above;40.6496;-74.3505
