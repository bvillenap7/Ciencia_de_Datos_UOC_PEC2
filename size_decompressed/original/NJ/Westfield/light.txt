I was around 7:00-7:30pm. I thought it was odd to see a star this early, but was amazed when I saw three more lights. I live about 20 miles from a major airport and know what I was seeing was not an airplane. We got the binoculars and could actually see the shape of the light. I looked like an ameba shaped light with red and yellow lights around the outside. The lights moved aross the sky and a fairly slow rate. The move in a somewhat straight line, but two hung together. The two that hung together , one was underneath the other, then moved up to the other at a very fast rate of speed and remained close to the other light. They moved together. The last light stayed behind. I know that some airplanes that take off from Newark International Airport must have seen these light. I NEED TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE SAW THEM!!!;40.6496;-74.3505
2 bright lights in the sky that was comming and going ,up and down and stoping and left to right.;2006-03-15 01:00:00;1 hour;2 bright lights in the sky that was comming and going ,up and down and stoping and left to right. My husband went to the bathroom and was looking by the window and was watching them for maybe 10 minutes, he came and wake me up telling me I had too see this. It was 2 lights like more bright than a star, (white)and it was round like it too. But it was no plane, or helicopters...none of what i ever seen. It was not going on a regular speed...sometimes fast and slowing down and going up and down and going to hide in a big cloud that was there. They where going left to right and somtimes doing a c motion....and one stop for like five minutes...and went to the cloud and they vanished. My husband is a contractor and im a house wife with kids.;40.6496;-74.3505
