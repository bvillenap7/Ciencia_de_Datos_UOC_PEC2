There was another car a ways in front of me that also might of seen it. I was on rt. 202 turning on to rt.  7 when I observed a fast moving green ball of fire fall straight down from the sky.  I thought it was a missile at first and waited for an explosion but nothing happened.  The object moved far to fast to even attempt to record.
