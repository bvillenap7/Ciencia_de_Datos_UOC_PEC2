At first I thought it was an eagle with prey.  But it had triangle shape wings on top and some thing hanging down under the wings, like a large barrel shape.  It was bright red on half of the right side of it.   With my line of sight I would say it was a few miles in front of my window.  About the size comparison of a dime, in distance, within my view.   As it banked to the left ,the top of the wings got bright white because it was sunrise here to the south west.  It kept moving to left and disappeared from view because of the trees.  It never went any further to the left of the tree line.  It was lost from my view.;44.6996;-69.1052
