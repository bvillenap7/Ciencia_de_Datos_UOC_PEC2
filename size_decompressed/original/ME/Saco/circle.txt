It reappeared thirty minutes later on the water line even brighter for another two minutes.   Unfortunately, we were caught off guard and couldn't catch it on video.  The police and coast guard called throughout the night as if it was a  flare (I dont think flaares can hover for two minutes in the same spot).  The coast guard told us that they sent aircraft to investigate.  We watched all night and saw no response.  My guess is they knew that it wasn't a distress call.  Anyway, it was unlike anything we had ever seen before.;43.5247999999996;-70.4559000000006
