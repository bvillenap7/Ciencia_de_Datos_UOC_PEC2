I was with my son driving back home from Sanford.  It was mid morning, no rain, just partly sunny and cloud cover.  No planes in area or the moon. We were facing SW and he looked up in cloud cover.  In the center of the clouds.  A very bright star looking UFO appeared.  We both were looking at it off and on, about 1 minute.  I can tell it was in the clouds.   A few minutes later is just disappeared.  Like it moved backwards.  Then about 10 minutes with the same clouds, no change, it appeared again in the same spot.;43.5247999999996;-70.4559000000006

At first I thought plane but when it registered what it was I realized planes don’t fly window level and or this close to homes nor do the hover outside I’m the window.  Once eye contact made it began to move closer to window then it just took off so fast it disappeared.  I always think and wonder  could it be a drone but I really have never seen something like this that moves at such a high speed.;43.5247999999996;-70.4559000000006
