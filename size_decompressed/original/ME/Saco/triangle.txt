I was driving from old orchard me, to Biddeford me. As I entered the town of Saco I noticed A very bright white light to the south of me .As I drove east on Saco ave I had lost it in the trees, Then when I pulled to the intersection of Rt 1 and Saco Ave it was to my Southeast and moving very very slow, So I Pulled into the Shop N Save parking lot and watched the triangle shaped craft move over me it was three times the size of any air craft id seen before and it had a hudge white light in the front and 1 large square in the bottom center of it and three smaller squares on each wing ,With a red light on each wing tip. this was either the stealth bomber or I Have been witness to a top secret craft or a ufo!!!!!!!!!!;43.5247999999996;-70.4559000000006
