White ball of light.;2014-09-27 05:30:00;30 seconds;White ball of light I looked up in the sky and thought I was looking at a bright star.  It was a bright ball of white light coming from the north.  It slowly banked to the east and went over the tree tops and out of site.  I'm not sure how high it was or the exact size. Its a ball of light thats the same which ever side you see.  It has no flashing lights like an aircraft would have. Also this summer in July around 2300 I saw the same type of light at about the same height. This one was moving west to east at the same slow speed. On this occasion I had a witness with me that also saw the light. I did not hear any sound from the objects on either occasion.;43.8946;-70.3479
