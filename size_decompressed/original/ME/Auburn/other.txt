Bright eractic moving lights.;2006-11-09 21:00:00;10 - 15 minutes;Bright eractic moving lights. My husband and I was standing on our deck looking east sky close to the tree line approx. 1 mi. away.  We saw a bright light that at first looked like a small plane perhaps with headlights on.  Then we noticed that it moved very fast and eractic - up and down and then it suddenly zoomed to the south but lost sight of it as our view became obstructed by trees on our property.  We only decided to report this since the following day there was an article in our local newspaper about a man who reported a UFO sighting (I can't remember the town) near Farmington, Maine.;44.0937999999999;-70.2368
