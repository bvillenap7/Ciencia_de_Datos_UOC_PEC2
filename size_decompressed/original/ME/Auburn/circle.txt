Round object traveled straight across the sky and then went straight upward until it disappeared amongst the stars.;2018-10-08 01:30:00;30 seconds;Round object traveled straight across the sky and then went straight upward until it disappeared amongst the stars. I had gone out on my deck to get some air and was looking at the Big Dipper and trying to locate the Little Dipper.  I then noticed a bright light, similar to the size of Venus, travelling across the sky in a north to south direction.  The speed was similar to that of a satelite or the space station when that passes.  The bright light did not have any other lights or flashing.  After traveling approximately 1/3 of the viewing area, the light was almost over my head.  The object then went straight upward and after about 10 seconds it disappeared.;44.0937999999999;-70.2368
