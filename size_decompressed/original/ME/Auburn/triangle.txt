TRIANGLE LIGHTS IN SKY;2003-09-22 21:00:00;4 minutes;TRIANGLE LIGHTS IN SKY As I was driving and was near my home in Auburn at about 9 PM.  I notice three lights in the sky that formed a triangle. The lights were fairly bright and if you hold your arm outstrethed, the size of the lights would be about the size of a nickel that you held in your hand.  The lights moved slowly simultaneously.  I was so amazed that I rushed home to get my wife, but by the time we went back, it was gone.

Navy NOSS satellite system.  PD));44.0937999999999;-70.2368
