Straight line object of 4 small lights with a VERY bright 5th light on left side;2021-08-09 18:45:00;8 seconds;Straight line object of 4 small lights with a VERY bright 5th light on left side I was a passenger in a vehicle and was looking up into the sky ahead. There were thick grey clouds rolling in, with possible storm, ahead. I saw a stationary object, that appeared to not be moving. It was a straight black line that had a very bright light on far left end, with approximately 4 smaller lights, in a straight line from the brightest light. We passed a line of trees, where I lost sight of it,for a moment of approx 4 seconds. As we passed the trees,a few feet ahead, I saw that there was NOTHING in the sky, in any direction. The object seemed to have vanished. It was unlike anything I have ever seen. I cannot say what shape it was because all I saw was the odd lights on a black straight line. It was NOT a drone or a plane.;44.0937999999999;-70.2368
