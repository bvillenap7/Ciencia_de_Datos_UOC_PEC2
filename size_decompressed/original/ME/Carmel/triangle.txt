When object was first seen, only two lights were visible (one red and one white).  I then noticed how low to the ground this craft was then I noticed the craft had stop traveling and was at this point hovering before and then began to travel back slightly in the direction it had just come from.   Next a spotlight became visible and scanned an area of ground very quickly.  As soon as the spotlight disappeared three lights were visible in a triangle or v shape instead of only two and all three lights were now white.  The craft hovered for a few moments then began to slowly descend as soon as the craft met the tree line from my few all lights disappeared and no craft was visible.   I sat parked on the side of the road a moment or so but the craft did not return;44.8038999999999;-68.9889000000001
