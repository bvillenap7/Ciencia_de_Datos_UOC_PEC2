Metallic Sphere flies within 30 feet of apartment.;2000-10-28 10:30:00;30 seconds;Metallic Sphere flies within 30 feet of apartment. I was lying in bed looking out my 2nd floor window when I noticed a metallic sphere, 3 ft. in diamaeter, shoot across my field of view.  The sun was reflecting off the sphere, and the reflection was very bright.  The sphere was about 20 feet above the ground, and 30 feet away from my apartment.  It was travelling south.  After I noticed the sphere, I ran to the window and got a very good view of it.  After a second or two it stopped, reversed direction, then reversed again about a second later, continuing on it's original path.  It shot away at an estimated 20 mph.  At that point I ran downstairs and outside to see if I could follow it.  By that time it was too far away.;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123

Simple truth as seen. (aircraft in vicinty whcih allowed me reference, but none chasing);2009-04-24 04:58:00;2minutes;Simple truth as seen. (aircraft in vicinty whcih allowed me reference, but none chasing) Watched ufo moving over my house, lower than crafts with airplanes with blinking lights.  resembled a star... but too slow to be meteor, sattelite, or shooting star.  Uniform speed, but relatively fast... fast as a jet liner at comperable height but entirely different. again no blinking lights, just bright like a star (airplanes flew higher and I could see their beacon lights!!!) just happened at 4:48 AM EST.;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123
8+ orange lights moving swift and silent in the night;2012-07-07 22:15:00;20 minutes;8+ orange lights moving swift and silent in the night From Peaks Island we watched lights rising from off in the distance beyond portland and moving silently but swiftly across the water, over the island and beyond.  They were small orange yellow lights that all moved in the same direction at about the same rate, spaced out in relatively equal distances from each other, with a few exceptions.  They were silent.
