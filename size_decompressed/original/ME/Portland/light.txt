Aircraft with bright white blinking light.  Velocity 200- 500 mph 0315 hrs;2002-07-05 03:15:00;2.5 sec;Aircraft with bright white blinking light.  Velocity 200- 500 mph 0315 hrs At 03:15 aprox. I saw a white flashing light traveling at 200 to 500 mph at an altitutude of 2,000 to 8,000 ft. break the tree line and do an 180 degree turn. However I lost sight of object as it traveled back into tree line.  Object was only visable by flashing light. The air craft blinked five times in about 2.5 seconds estimated velocity at 200 to 500mph.  Most aircraft cant make a 180 turn in 2.5 seconds. At first I thought object was a fixed wing aircraft beacause of the blinking light, however, when object reversed at 180 degrees I realized that the object was not a fixed wing machine.  I have spent a year at an Army air base in South Korea and I am well aware of the manuverability of most NATO and Comercial aircraft.  I may be mistaken but I don't think so. Note, I could not see the body of the craft only the blinking light.  The distance from craft was at least two or three miles.;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123
Bright white light hovering near Portland International Jetport.  Object turns bright red and silver, then disappears within seconds.;2007-05-08 23:00:00;5 minutes;Bright white light hovering near Portland International Jetport.  Object turns bright red and silver, then disappears within seconds. On the night of May 8th, 2007,  my friend and I were walking the Fore River Sanctuary Trail.  When we crossed the bridge, we noticed a very bright light, which we first assumed was an aircraft.  We realized it couldn't have been an airplane due to the fact that it hadn't moved.  It was a very bright, constant, white light.  The object then turned from white to red, became brighter, and illuminated the sky surrounding it.  The object then appeared to shoot off into the horizon, far faster than any aircraft I have ever seen.   The object seemed to be hovering to the northwest of the Portland Jetport, most likely over Westbrook or Gorham.

Venus sized light;2010-07-12 02:45:00;20 seconds;Venus sized light it looked like a star. then started moving . i thought it was a plane perhaps turning, but then it took off fast until it faded out and disapeared , it crossed half of the entire sky in 20 seconds progressivly getting faster . it was about the size of venus in the sky.;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123
Bright orange orb observed flying over Casco Bay from the Eastern Promenade.;2011-06-03 22:00:00;45 sec - 1 min;Bright orange orb observed flying over Casco Bay from the Eastern Promenade. Standing on the Eastern Promenade a bright orange orb was coming in fast from the south east over Peak's Island and then dramatically taking a turn very fast and heading northeast and then fading very quickly in the night sky over long island.   The light was orange like fire and did not look like a shooting  star, as it turned vastly and did not break apart.;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123
Five points of light, bit brighter than stars, all moving erratically in one direction;2011-10-31 20:40:00;30 seconds;Five points of light, bit brighter than stars, all moving erratically in one direction I didn't see any crafts, I saw five points of light traveling from WNW to ESE in a squiggly way.  They looked like stars traveling together and moved like flies zig zagging independently within the group heading in one direction.  Never reported nor have seen this before.;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123
Four steady lights in the night sky moving quickly changing direction abruptly.;2014-08-25 21:30:00;5 seconds;Four steady lights in the night sky moving quickly changing direction abruptly While outside taking the dog for a walk I happened to glance up into the sky (it was a clear night) and noticed in the viewline just above the trees behind my apartment four unblinking white lights traveling together.   The lights appeared a bit larger than stars and were moving across the sky at a high rate of speed like satellites (but much larger than satellites normally appear).  They were traveling south and toward the horizon  I was looking west, so it seems that were headed on a southwestern trajectory.   Suddenly, the lights changed their orientation relative to each other, and then the group as a whole changed their direction abruptly and quickly, away from the horizon, and then they disappeared from my view.  This entire episode happened in five seconds and was not long enough in duration for me to get a corroborating witness.  My dog, however, began to look up at the sky without provocation and continued to look at the sky for around thirty seconds, which is atypical for him. I have never seen anything like this and until now have been skeptical of UFO sightings, chalking up any strange phenomena that other people have seen to atmospheric refraction, military testing or just other aircraft.  Tonight's sighting has certainly made me more open-minded on the matter.;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123

We noticed an orange light off the port side way up in the sky but closer than any star it was slowly moving to the left and when my wife pulled out her camera she couldn't get a picture of it so when I took mine out we looked up and it was gone;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123
A group of adults witness two lights, moving rapidly overhead, which quickly swap positions.;2018-07-13 22:30:00;5 seconds;A group of adults witness two lights, moving rapidly overhead, which quickly swap positions. At approximately 10:30 PM Eastern Standard Time (3:30 AM UTC) two fast-moving objects were spotted in the sky directly above Portland, Maine.  The two objects initially followed identical linear trajectories through the night sky, separated by about 5 degrees of arc, coming into sight directly overhead.   The two lights were point-source, with brightness similar to a dim star.  At an incredibly high altitude, the fast-movers paralleled each other with great velocity – much faster than any satellite could travel while still maintaining orbit, and much faster than any known commercial or military aircraft.   Around 4 to 5 seconds after visual contact was established, the two objects immediately jutted to the left and to the right to cross paths with each other moments later.  The movement was seemingly impossible and violated laws of conservation of momentum, as an extremely large external force must’ve been present in order to move them in such a way.  After crossing! paths, the two objects returned to their original distance of separation and, with the same seemingly-impossible course correction, returned to their linear trajectories.  Two other witnesses and myself maintained visual contact until light pollution from the nearby city of Portland caused us to lose contact.

This happened 3 times in roughly 10 minutes. I couldn't see a craft and there was no sound. A fourth light I was able to see with binoculars. Looked like satellite;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123
