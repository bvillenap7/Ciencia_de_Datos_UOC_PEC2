I saw a triangle shaped object flying in the sky in Portland, Maine. It was in the form of a triangle, but not a complete triangle, the back of it was open. Like this > . It was made of several bright balls of light. I would have thought it was one big object until one of the balls of lights came out of it's top position, flew down to one of the other balls and started swirling around it! It was like they were playing with each other. The light returned to it's exact top position, the object hovered for awhile longer and then in the blink of an eye they burst off to the right and dissapeared out of sight. When they took off it was unbelievably fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123

My mother came to visit me in maine and i took a friend with us out for the weekend with her. I think it was a friday night and we were laying out on the beach chairs by the pool. My friend mom, and i were just looking up at the sky and talking, around 11:30 before going to sleep.And were were hearing jets in the air flying earlier.after they had stop about 20 min later is when i had saw 3 triangular shape objects flying in the sky and they were glowing sort of a orangis color.I said look at that and they both were watching it with me.it was kind of freaky beacause they were going too fast to b anything i have seen and made no sound easily breaking the sound barrier.soo they were all flying in a v formation. they never slowed down when making these moves:the left one dropped straight down and went forward....the front one out of nowere shot to the left with out slowing down either straight out of its original course and then shot forward again and the other one curved to the left shot up and immediatly after that they came back into formation again a v shape and flew off...later that week one of my friends was camping in the woods at that same time i saw it and saw the same objects that i did and he told me that when i saw him before i had said anything to him so it kind of sent chills down my spine..........i never thought of reporting it untill i was watching sightings few days ago.;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123
