My husband and I were lying in bed watching t.v. about 8:00 p.m on December 16, 2012.  We have 3 skylights facing north-west.  He said he saw something go by the skylight.  I thought, at first, that he was talking about a fly in the room or something.  He said it was a yellow object but was going too slow to be a plane. That's when I saw them. I got out of bed, very agitated, and looked out all the skylights.  Truly, my first thought was that they were UFO's because I had never seen anything like it before. I went downstairs in the dark as I didn't want to draw attention to myself to the, so I thought, UFO's.  I went to my slider looking into my backyard to get a better look. What I saw were circular objects that looked like yellow/orange fireballs larger than a bright star but smaller than a full moon.  They were traveling from my right to my left at about a 45 degree angle in height.  They were traveling in sets of 3 in a triangular formation.  I probably saw 9 of them.  I said, They just keep coming!   As I was looking at them, I called 911 to report what I was seeing.  Then I told the dispatcher I had to get my binoculars to see what the heck they were.  I was able to see them thru my binoculars, but I didn't see anything different than what I was seeing with my naked eye/no other shape or form.   The sighting lasted about 3 minutes or so.  Still agitated, I went back upstairs to bed.  WOW!;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123
