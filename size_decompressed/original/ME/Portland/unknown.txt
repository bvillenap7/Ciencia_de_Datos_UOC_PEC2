implanted piece in hand.;2000-09-16 01:00:00;3 hours;implanted piece in hand. i was taken into their ship at around 1 am, i didnt realize it was 4 when i got back, the next week i had broken my hand and then got it xrayed and found that there was something implanted in my right thumb area. It was a little T shaped thing and the doctor didnt have any explanation about what it was because nothing has been done to that hand and i never have cut it. My mom has also told me stories that she woke up when the aliens were putting me back in my crib but she was awake and it happened more then once. All the women in our family have ovary problems. Thats my story. And periodically practically all the time my right thumb swells up and then goes down all of a sudden with no pain at all. ((NUFORC Note:  We will encourage the witness to have the X-ray of her thumb examined by a physician, in order to determine whether the alleged object is, in fact, a foreign body.

While at work on the Ptld, Maine, waterfront ,at 2a.m I did see bright white lights, 25-45 sec, that vanishedbehind,into a cloud ,;2003-11-25 02:00:00;10 minutes;While at work on the Ptld, Maine, waterfront ,at 2a.m I did see bright white lights, 25-45 sec, that vanishedbehind,into a cloud , 25 November 2003, I was at my work, on the Portland waterfront at approx. 2 a.m..  It was a rather clear night with very few clouds,I looked towards South Portland and the Spring Point area where there are some oil storage tankers, there is a flight pattern to Portland International Jetport near to where I was looking. Two and then up to four very bright white  lights appeared for approximately 25-45  seconds  just like a large plane would in approximately the same  usual flight pattern  , but just the bright lights , no sound, no  solid object that I could see. The lights then went into a very large , very white cloud that was low  over the oil tanks. I watched the cloud go towards Portland , slowly, almost meandering, across Portland Harbor over Bath Iron Works[which by the way was working on a huge oil rig at the time] towards the Eastern Promenade  and beyond.I did not see the lights again after they went behind, into ? the large cloud.;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123
