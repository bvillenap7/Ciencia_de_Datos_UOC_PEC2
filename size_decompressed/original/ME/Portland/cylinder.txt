Cylindrical object disappeared in clear skies.;2016-06-24 15:30:00;1 second;Cylindrical object disappeared in clear skies I was driving on Washington Ave in Portland, ME, stopped at a stop light.  The sky was clear today and there were no clouds or trees obstructing my view.  It was a bright sunny afternoon and this happened around 3:30 PM.  I saw an object that looked like a horizontal cylinder - shades of white and gray, not shiny, no lights.  I only saw it for about one second, just long enough to see it was moving from right to left (northeast to southwest).   About a second after I started tracking the object with my eyes, it simply vanished.  While it was visible to me, it looked like how planes look sometimes when you can't see their wings so they look kind of like a UFO until they change angles so you can see the wings.  In that one instant, that's what I thought it probably was, until it disappeared.  The object was perhaps about 45-60 degrees from the plane of the horizon, and I'd guess its length was about 1/3 to 1/4 the angular diameter of the full moon.;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123
