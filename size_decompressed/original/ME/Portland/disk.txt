I'm visiting my mom for a few days and slept above her garage last night (7/7/2013 into 7/8/2013).  I started awake at 4:45am to strangely blue light filling the windows.   When I checked it out, I didn't see anything but the sky returning to dull, grey and overcast.  Figuring I had woken up because I was cold, I threw on some underwear and went back to sleep (how I'm confident I was not sleepwalking/dreaming). I woke up again that morning (still before 5:00am) and checked the window to find a 40-foot disc suspended 15 feet above the neighbours' house (a stone's throw away).   I noticed 3 lights on the top-side of it and a blue cylinder of light coming from the bottom onto the roof of the house below.   This image is vivid for me, but everything after is vague.  The disc departed and I threw on a shirt and went back to sleep.;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123
