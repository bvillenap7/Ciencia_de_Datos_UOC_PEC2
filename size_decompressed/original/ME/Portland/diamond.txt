Square dark object w/red lights at each of its corners over Casco Bay Bridge in Portland, ME;2012-07-04 23:30:00;2 minutes;Square dark object w/red lights at each of its corners over Casco Bay Bridge in Portland, ME My cousin and I (who are in our early 20's) were driving back home to South Portland over the Casco Bay Bridge when I noticed an object in the air (a little bit lower than where most planes fly).  It wasn't moving, just staying in the air.  I pointed it out to my cousin, and she said it must be a plane. Then it started moving, faster than a plane would.  We could clearly see the shape. It was square, with 4 red lights at each corner of the craft.  It seemed to be dark gray or black. Before my cousin had the chance to catch it on film, it was already over Casco Bay and into the Portland area.  Although there may not be any connection, two police cars had their sirens on and started going across the bridge just as it moved into Portland. It looked exactly like the ones in these pictures:  http://www.ufopictures.info/triangular/;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123
