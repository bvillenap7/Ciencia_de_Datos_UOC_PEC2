Soon thereafter, it was if one of the stars picked  up and travelled southward and then pulled a 'J' hook towards the East.  The object was as tiny and appeared reddish in color.  The object moved at a steady pace across the sky.  It did not make a sound, nor leave any trail like a shooting star.  It travelled slower than a shooting star, and faster than a plane or helicopter, without any noise. The evening began with me discussing certain unexplained philosphical phenomena with two other people.  I took the angle of the scientific observer.  I wanted proof of the 'religious' nature of the universe as the people I was talking to exclaimed to exist.  I have always had a week spot in me for the unexplained, but yet, I have never really experienced anything that strayed me from the scientific and the provable.  Yet tonight, as I came home, parked my car in the driveway, I looked up to a remarkably clear sky.  I focused on a constellation, I'm not sure which, and, all of a sudden, a star like object began to move across the sky, starting in this constellation.  I watched it travel in my direction, although it was completely at a great distance.  It was if one of the stars just picked up and decided to move.  I watched it move across the sky at a fairly rapic pace without changing course.  Then it pulled a 'J' manoever in the sky.  It began moving to the southeast and then the east and then partially toward the north.  It did not leave a trail in the evening sky nor did it make a sound as it travelled.  It did not blink like an airplane wing light.  It did not shoot across the sky like a shooting star, of which I've seen thousands.  It was very deliberate yet quick across the sky.  I've seen satellites which moved slower and continued on a straight line.  This object curved in a 'J' motion.  I was cradled in my driveway by trees towards the southern end and it eventually disappeared behind the trees.  I wish I could say that I was under the influence but I wasn't.  The thing appeared and travelled like nothing I have ever seen in the sky before, and I spend a lot of time looking at the sky in Maine, where you receive more than the fair share of night time entertainment.  This wasn't what is ordinarily in my sky.;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123

I saw a shape moving from north to south towards the downtown area which I, at first, thought was a VERY large bird. The craft was completely silent and moved in a perfectly straight line towards the downtown area. It was black and shiny, probably about 50 feet wide, boomarange shaped, and about 100 feet up with no lights (I could see the light from the spotlights around the field shining off of it). The whole sighting lasted about 3 to 4 seconds as it moved quickly, but not fast, towards the downtown area. It seemed to be lined up with the ABC building (which has an electronic bilboard around the top and it the tallest building in the city). I heard a group of others yelling and clapping in the distance and I can only assume that they had seen it as well.;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123

((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witnesses to this event, and they insisted that the object they witnesses was not a contrail behind a high-altitude jet.  One of the witnesses had worked for an overseas airline, and insisted that had the object been a contrail, she would have been able to identify it easily.  PD));43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123

Between 1030 and 1130am I was working on Forest Avenue in Portland Maine. I noticed the sun had a rainbow all the way around it. I decided to take some pictures with my cell phone. So I took 4 pictures. On my next break I checked out the pictures. In two pictures one can plainly see that there is a hexagonal shaped U.F.O. It is apparent that it is moving at a fast speed. I took 3 pic in like 4-5 seconds and the two pictures that show the UFO it is in different places in the photo.;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123
Lights that turned into a white cloud;2020-09-11 22:01:00;7 minutes;Lights that turned into a white cloud I was on my balcony that over looks the ocean on two separate occasions dating 08/30/2020 at 20:55 and 09/11/2020 at 22:01 I recorded both sightings. The first in August, I saw lights that were visible for a minute or two, I yelled to my son to come see if I was losing my mind. I began to record and then the lights turned into a white cloud that was floating through the sky, and just vanished. The next sighting was not long after on September 11 2020 I saw a weird light in the sky which again called my son to witness and also recorded   The second sighting last much longer then the first and was different itâ€™s hard to explain but I was able to catch both on video.;43.6633054367746;-70.2673009163123
