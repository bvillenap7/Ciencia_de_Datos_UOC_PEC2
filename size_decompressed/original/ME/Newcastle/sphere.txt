Witnessed it while driving south on Rte.  1 in Newcastle. It was still visible on Rte.  1 in Wiscasset, but further away.  I took a picture of it. It is a sphere, with two stripes around it.  It is lit up differently on different sections.  It caught my eye, because its lights did not blink.;44.0499;-69.5280000000001
