Orb against the setting sun.;2002-08-14 19:30:00;5 minutes;Orb against the setting sun. I had just left my house in Leeds and was on my way to Portland.  I came up over a hill and silhouetted against the lower left quadrant of the setting sun was an orb.  I pulled over and watched it for approximately 5 minutes.  It didn't seem to move and was stationary against the setting sun.  I saw another report and decided to post.  At the time, I assumed that it was a transit of Mercury or Venus, but an astronomer friend said there were no transits at the time.  It was a neat astronomical event and it's interesting that others reported it.;44.2856;-70.1295
