I was standing out on my deck and looking up into the Southwest sky. I was admiring the stars and suddenly noticed one moving. It was very high up. I would guess that it was not within our atmosphere. If this object had been standing still I would have thought that it was a star and thought nothing of it, if it had moved in a straight line I would have thought that it was a satellite or meteor, but it did not move in a straight line. This object moved across the sky in a zig zag pattern (in a repeated s shape). I watched it for a few seconds and thought about going to get my wife to have her come and see it, but I was afraid that it would be gone by the time that I got back. I watched it for approximately 10 seconds and then it disappeared. I watched for a few minutes after this and went back out a couple more times to see if I could see it again, but I did not see it again that evening.;44.2021;-70.3754
