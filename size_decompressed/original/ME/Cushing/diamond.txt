Very bright, white light.  Maybe round or vaguely diamond/star shaped.  Didnâ€™t appear to be moving.  It was larger than a star or satellite, and significantly smaller than a full moon.  We watched it for about 30 sec, then we moved inside (+/- 3 sec) and looked for it again.  None of us saw it disappear.  We looked through window from inside and it was gone.  We visit this area every year and have never seen anything like this. Additionally, this afternoon (8/27/19), we were surprised to see a large Coast Guard boat motoring through this same area in Maplejuice Cove at around noon/1:00 today, heading North toward Rockland, ME.  We have never seen a Coast Guard boat in this area before.;43.9844;-69.2768
