Lifelong UFO's;1982-11-01 06:15:00;5 minutes;Lifelong UFO's   Do not email me back. I witnessed a UFO when young. It was ring shaped but changed size and shape with a blue/gray translucency. It slowly went thru the bare treetops. I experienced several changes after this event. I also saw a small hovercraft at another time soon afterwards. I beleive it was of US Military in type. It hovered over a small pine wood ridge in the forest. Later in life I witnessed with another person, a group of triangular lighted crafts at night time and had an experience with a man in black. The crafts were located over Shea's Monument in Mass. I am not using Word and I am only sending this due to future events that will occur before the end of this year. Do not contact me except in person if you need to. My family does not know so I do not want phone calls, emails or other intrusive communications. I am not going to check the box indicating investigator contact because I do not know what that entails. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));43.9508;-69.79
