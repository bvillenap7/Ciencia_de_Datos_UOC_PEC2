I was a passenger, my daughter was driving, S/SE on Rte 235 out of Hope, ME.  We were ascending a fairly steep hill when I noticed a triangle of lights in the sky.   As we climbed up the hill, I realized the lights were not moving.  My daughter pulled over and I rolled down my window.  The craft noiselessly moved slowly in a N/NE direction until it was out of view. ((NUFORC Note:  I spoke with the witness, and he seemed to me to be unusually serious-minded.  I suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD));44.2569;-69.1515
