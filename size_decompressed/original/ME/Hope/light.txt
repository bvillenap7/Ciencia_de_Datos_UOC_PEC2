I looked up and saw a ball of light, circular in shape.  It was hard to tell how high up it was, but it was huge, at least ten times the size of a plane when you see them in the sky.  And it was completely silent.  It moved across the sky much like a shooting star, but a little slower.  It was a light blue color with and electric bluish purple center.;44.2569;-69.1515
