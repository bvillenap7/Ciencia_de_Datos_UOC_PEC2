ABOUT THIRTY BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHTS DRIFTED SLOWLY EAST AND ROSE UPWARDS OVER CAMDEN MAINE, BETWEEN 9 PM AND 10 PM  JUNE 23RD, 2012,;2012-06-23 21:00:00;1 hour;ABOUT THIRTY BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHTS DRIFTED SLOWLY EAST AND ROSE UPWARDS OVER CAMDEN MAINE, BETWEEN 9 PM AND 10 PM,  JUNE 23RD, 2012, AT FIRST I SAW THREE BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHTS SLOWLY DRIFTING ACROSS THE SKY TOWARD THE EAST AND RISING HIGHER TOWARD THE CLOUDS.   FOR OVER AN HOUR A SERIES OF GROUPS OF BRIGHT ORANGE LIGHTS APPEARED OVER THE CAMDEN HILLS AND ROSE UP TOWARD THE EAST OVER PENOBSCOT BAY DISAPPEARING BEHIND THE CLOUDS.  GROUPS OF THREE LIGHTS, FOUR LIGHTS, OR FIVE LIGHTS FOLLOWED EACH OTHER AT FIVE TO TEN MINUTE INTERVALS,  EACH OF THEM WANDERING AROUND SLOWLY AS IF BLOWN BY WIND CURRENTS.  EVERY ONE OF THE LIGHTS WAS EXACTLY THE SAME BRIGHTNESS AND THE LIGHT WAS STEADY, NOT FLICKERING.  NONE OF THEM TURNED ON OR OFF -  THEY FINALLY DISAPPEARED INTO THE CLOUDS OVER THE BAY.  THERE WAS NO SOUND.  I WATCHED WITH BINOCULARS BUT COULD NOT SEE ANY SURROUNDING STRUCTURE AROUND THE ORANGE LIGHTS.   THEY WERE UNLIKE ANYTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.   I AM A RETIRED PHYSICIAN AND THE AUTHOR OF A SCIENCE TEXT ON THE OCEAN TIDES. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be an exceptional witness.  He reported that the apparent diameter of the objects appeared to be approximately one tenth the apparent diameter of a full moon.  The witness will provide additional information about the direction of the wind at the surface, and the winds aloft.  PD));44.2115;-69.0735
