Large orange immobile &quotstar&quot suddenly began to move slowly across the sky.;2013-03-26 05:00:00;5 minutes;Large orange immobile star suddenly began to move slowly across the sky. I got up at 5 am to turn off my alarm and my fiance called me the bedroom window.  Look at that, she said,  What is that?   I looked out and saw an unusually bright star or planet to the southwest.  It was very bright orange and large.  Wow, I said.  It looks like a planet or something.   I then went to the bathroom, where I was when she suddenly called me back in.  A!  Come in here, quick! It's moving!   I looked out and, indeed, it was moving across the sky in a northeasterly direction, very bright and steady.  I got chills down my spine, as it had been totally stationary just moments before.  Within 3 minutes, the event was over and the light had passed out of our sight.;44.2115;-69.0735
