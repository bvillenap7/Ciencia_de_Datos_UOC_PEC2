A triangle shaped object with 3 yellow lights on bottom and a white light on each corner.;2008-05-25 21:57:00;25 seconds;A triangle shaped object with 3 yellow lights on bottom and a white light on each corner. Witness One:  I saw a triangle shape and it was traveling pretty fast. It started from the northwest and it traveled to the southeast. It was going pretty fast so i didn't have a lot of time to look at it but I looked at the lights and I could see three yellow on the bottom and three on each corner of the triange. That made it stand out that it looked like a triangle. We live right next to the airport so i thought it was a plane but it was going way too fast and it made no noise at all.  Witness Two:  I saw the same thing only I ddin't see the shape, I just saw red and yellow lights and it was going too fast to be a plane and too quiet to be a plane or helicopter.  Witness Three: I saw red and yellow lights on a triangle shaped thing. I was going very fast.;43.5825000000002;-70.3513000000005

No other clouds in sky. The shape appeared to mirror the color of the sky when looking @ it, the outline was a cloud like haze. Was not moving. I do not know how long the object was there, however, my viewing lasted five minutes @ 1210pm - 1215pm, 2-13-20.  Object outline  began to evaporate/disappear  like a fuse would burn, it started at one corner and gone. Then immediately, center to the objects position fell a shiny orb, straight down behind  a distant tree line.  Monitored the position for an hour, no further data.;43.5825000000002;-70.3513000000005
