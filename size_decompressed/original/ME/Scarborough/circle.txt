U.F.O. circle-shaped, w/V at top white/reddish color with brilliance and movement (as if pulled by gravity).;2002-09-13 01:15:00;1.5 hrs;U.F.O. circle-shaped, w/ V at top white/reddish color with brilliance and movement (as if pulled by gravity) White-reddish circular object with wide V to the top in white, with brilliance. Black sky with many stars.  Crystal-clear view of object, that appeared to move smoothly, not fast, to various positions,couldn't predict what movement it would go. I was making my security rounds and the lights color is what made me look.  I observed first stationary-type object but immediately it begun to move.  It was easy to see the movementswhen I focused either side of object.  This U.F.O. was over ocean water, appeared good distance from coast, approximately 1/2 mile off shore at probably a 90 degree angle, I had to look directly up, looking out at the ocean, to make a visual.   I took my flashlight and clicked it of and on slowly and then rapidly.  It seems as though the object would move, after the flashing of the light, I sent out to it.  It appeared it was observing what I was doing.  I originally observed the object for half an hour, then I reported the sighting to local police.   A police officer came to my location and immediately saw the object. we walked to a darkened area of the inn and observed the U.F.O. moving and casting the white/reddish colors.  He stated he would contact F.A.A. for any air traffic.  The only air traffic was a plane I observed at 3:15a.m.  The police officer said he would go to the station for binoculors and try to observe object at a beach a couple miles down, because he said the object looked as if it was closer to that particular beach, in other words a better view.  I contacted the night auditor and he saw the object.  We watched it and it make movements.I will look for the craft tonight, at approximately 1:30a.m.  It may return or it may not.  All I know is I observed and had witnesses observe a U.F.O.;43.5825000000002;-70.3513000000005

5 bright orange lights moving through sky from due East to due North disappeared in sequence;2012-04-19 20:42:00;9 minutes;5 bright orange lights moving through sky from due East to due North disappeared in sequence At 20:42, I took my dog out to use the bathroom and noticed three orange lights coming from the East, heading North, in perfect sequence, in a parade.  I observed that they were silent, non-blinking, fast paced, spaced evenly between each light.  They were orange, approximately three times larger than a star, moving at approximately 300-400 miles per hour.  After seeing the third one coming through the trees, I ran in the house and alerted my family to see.  We ran onto the back deck, observing the two lights left since I had entered the house.  The lights disappeared in sequence at the same time.  We were looking at the sky for five more minutes and observed two more lights appearing in the same direction, same heading.  I had my daughter use her phone to take pictures of the lights as they moved through the sky.  The second light, following the first, disappeared, and we followed the other going due North out of sight behind the trees.  They were also silent and! looked like bright pumpkins going through the sky.  They also appeared to be the same distance apart.;43.5825000000002;-70.3513000000005
Ball-shaped green light zooms through the sky, stops, then continues.;2015-07-31 23:50:00;5 seconds;Ball-shaped green light zooms through the sky, stops, then continues. I was driving North on I-95, at about 23:50.  I saw a light flash in the sky out of the corner of my eye, so I turned my head slightly to the left, expecting to see a shooting star.  To my surprise, it was a green ball of light, much larger than any star.  I watched it move a very short distance quickly from left to right, and then it stopped.   After only being stopped for one second, it seemed to pull back a little and then sped off in the same direction it was headed.  It was visible for only another second or two and them it seemed to disappear into nothing.  It did not have a tail and it was too far away to make out any physical features other than just that it was round.   When I got home, I was a little shaken up, but I wasn’t convinced I had seen an alien spaceship.  The next morning, however, (yesterday) I woke up extremely sore. Looking more into aliens and UFOs, I found that could mean possible alien contact.   Also I have had this strange bump on my left ring finger that randomly appeared a few months ago.  It doesn’t hurt but I constantly play with it, and my doctor said it was nothing.  It doesn’t show up in X-rays.  All of this could of course be random, weird coincidences, and really I still don’t know if I believe in all of it, but I figured it was worth sharing with people who have heard a lot of these stories.;43.5825000000002;-70.3513000000005
