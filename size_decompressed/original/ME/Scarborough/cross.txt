4 x-shaped flying objects.;2016-05-31 16:15:00;5 seconds;4 x shaped flying objects. We was driving north on Payne Rd in Scarborough, ME, on 5/31/2016, at about 4:15 PM and not very high above the trees at about 45 degrees 4 x shaped objects flew over the road in front of us they formed the shape of a diamond as they flew very fast very close together so close together you would think they were connected but they was not.    They made no sound if a jet would have been that close it would have been loud Many people must have seen them at rush hour about a mile from the Maine;43.5825000000002;-70.3513000000005
