For unforeseen delays I was at least an half hour to 45 minutes behind schedule.  ((anonymous report));2016-11-22 04:45:00;3-5 seconds;I just wanna to get home this particular morning. But for unforeseen delays I was at least an half hour to 45 minutes behind schedule.  I get done and I'm driving south on what is an average early morning dark roadway.  I glance up at the roofline of the SUV once in a while to scan the night sky . It's a routine I try to keep, but this time I see something I believe to be odd because of the size and brightness of the glow that can't be ignored.  I look away for a few seconds to focus on the roadway and to check if there is a overpass . I wanted to make sure I was safely at a distance from traffic way ahead of me, as I looked back up I noticed the light began a falling star movement. As soon as I could gather the thought to tell myself you might wanna make a wish the light moved so fast I couldn't even finish the wish.  I couldn't believe my eyes it was gone in flash after moving for 2 seconds.  It was like turning a light switch after it was realized I knew it was there.  I had always heard these things were pretty fast but this was remarkable to see how it just flashed and disappeared was nothing less than futuristic. I am a believer now that we are primitively occupying an advanced location on this earth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
