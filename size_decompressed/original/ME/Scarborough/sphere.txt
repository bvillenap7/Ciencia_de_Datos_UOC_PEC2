When I was observing the jets flying by, I noticed a light-silver orb shaped UFO circling one non-commercial jet approximately 40,000 feet in the air.   After going around the jet, the UFO flew about 300-500 feet away from the jet, then disappeared.   This was observed during an intermission period at Beech Ridge.
