Incredibly fast tranveling large white ball of light over Scarborough.;2003-11-25 00:00:00;1-2 seconds;incredibly fast tranveling large white ball of light over scarborough The sighting occured while I was driving home with my girlfriend at 11 or 12 at night, travelling what I believe would be northbound on Fogg Rd (a couple miles inland from the ocean) in scarborough.  My girlfriend was driving, and I was slouched in the front passanger seat, looking out the windshield.  I saw a large, intensely white (at least it appeared white compared to the dark surroundings) ball of light fly through the sky, parallel to the road, traveling in the same direction as the car.  The light was travelling incredibly fast and appeared to be rather low to the ground, as it was out of sight within one second (however, my range of vision was limited, as I could only see it once it became visible through the windshield, rather than directly overhead).  By the time I could react it had vanished into the trees. My immediate thought was that it was some very large comet that had passed through the earth's atmosphere and was waiting to hear some deafening boom.  But I never heard a thing over the car radio.  My girlfriend claims that she did not notice it, which does not surprise me, as she was a bit tired and concentrating on driving, as well as the fact that the light disappeared almost instantly from view. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.5825000000002;-70.3513000000005
Very fast moving lights chasing each other and moving very eratically.;2006-10-08 17:30:00;10 - 15 Minutes;Very fast moving lights chasing each other and moving very eratically I looked up and saw a bright light, it dimmed and went what seemed, straight up. As it was going up, another light seemed to come out of nowhere and chase the first light. There were then three of these lights, circling and moving. I ran to the house and got my wife. She immediately saw the same thing and saw 3 or 4 more lights moving in the sky. I thought the initial light was a sattelite, but then it was joined by the second light that was moving in different directions. I thought that it may have been jet fighters training, but there was no visible contrail or any sound and they all seemed to vanish at the same time. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed the flare of an Iridium satellite, followed by another satellite in the same area of the sky.  PD));43.5825000000002;-70.3513000000005
Witnessed 4 orange lights, 3 equidistant apart and the 4th light set apart and all travelling low/slow in the night sky and dissapeared;2011-12-31 23:15:00;1 minute;Witnessed 4 orange lights, 3 equidistant apart and the 4th light set apart and all travelling low/slow in the night sky and dissapeared My wife and I were traveling home last night at approximately 23:15, when I noticed in the sky a series of orange lights low in the sky.   At first I thought they were lights from a plane, because of the height in the sky.  But, I quickly realized that something was different, because there were 4 lights and the color was orange.  They couldn't have been lights from a plane.   The lights seemed to be traveling slowly, about the same speed as you would see a plan traveling in the sky.  3 of the lights were grouped together and equidistant from each other.   The 4th light was set a little further out from the group of the 3, but all traveling in the same plane and at the same speed.  I asked my wife to pull and I started to get my iphone ready to see if I could take a video.   By the time I got out of the car, the lights started to dim and dissapeared.  Almost like the lights were turned off.  They did not shoot off in the sky or anything like that, but just dissa! peared.   My wife also witnessed the entire event.  All my life I have been the biggest skeptic of UFO's. But this has changed my perspective on these type of sightings.  It was unlike anything that I have ever seen before, and something that I have no explanation for.;43.5825000000002;-70.3513000000005
6 orange light spheres moving from the East to due North before vanishing.;2012-04-19 20:42:00;9 minutes;6 orange light spheres moving from the East to due North before vanishing At 20:42, male head of household (my father) rushed inside from taking the dog out to the bathroom exclaiming that there was something weird going on in the sky.  I rushed outside with my two brothers, mother, and father and gaped at the sight of 3-4 bright orange lights moving in a formation from the East straight North. They were bright orange, almost the color of pumpkins, and moving in a straight line, with no sound. The lights did not blink at all and were obviously not any kind of aircraft, satellite, meteor, or naturally occurring in any way.   There were no clouds in the sky and the last light slowly faded out, almost like someone turning out a kerosene lamp.  We waited outside, discussing it, when two more lights appeared from the East and headed due North once more. One vanished faster than the other, which continued due North until it, too, disappeared.  These two seemed lower in the sky than the others, and the one that vanished last almost seemed li! ke it was constantly adjusting its height, dipping up and down.  None of the lights seemed naturally occurring in any way and we have not seen any since.  I managed to get pictures of the last two, although with my phone they only showed up as bright specks against the black sky.;43.5825000000002;-70.3513000000005
4 orange lights fly across tree line.;2012-04-19 20:42:00;9 minutes;4 orange lights fly across tree line Finishing my chores around 8:42 this night, my dad rushed inside from taking the dog out the front door and yelled at us to turn off the lights and come out on the back porch because there was something weird in the sky.  I was the first one out besides my dad and I saw a pair of orange lights flying in a straight line emerging from the tree line.  By this time all of the lights in the house were off and I could see them very clearly.   After about 15 to 20 seconds I was watching the first light and I couldn’t notice the second anymore, so I turned my eyes back to look for it but it had vanished.  This is when someone cried out that the first had vanished as well which indeed it had.   We stayed outside for a couple more minutes thinking about it when my dad said suddenly that he sees them again through the trees.  We could see another light but couldn’t tell if it was a plane or another light until it too emerged following the same straight path through the trees as the first had.  This light was also part of a pair and the second quickly followed suit with a large gap in-between.    My entire family aside from my oldest brother was out at this point and we were all staring at them.  Just as the first pair had, the second light suddenly halted and blanked out at the same point as last time.  The first light however, kept moving forward until it reached the next tree line where it too blanked out from my vision.;43.5825000000002;-70.3513000000005
