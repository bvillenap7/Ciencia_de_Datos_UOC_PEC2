Scarborough), Maine.  Looking for anyone who was there 1975. I was waiting on rt 1 at the Portland twin drive in Scarborough, Maine, waiting to let the cars in, and I noted something to the SE  it was yellow orange on the bottom.  i didn't think to much about it but I kept looking that way and it was still there. so we drove in and parked.  about half hour later I saw it in the south.  Rite by the Scarborough downs sign about 50 to 75 feed off the ground about a mile away and moving are way.  i thought it  was strange so I kept looking over at it.  Now I'm thinking what is that thing its going so slow.  it went rite over the front of a shopping center and people were looking up and running some were dropping there bags.  it was close enough for me to see it was white on top and side and square lights panels around its bottom side that flashed a yellow orange strobe not in any type of order it kept coming in at a straight line it had been about 30+mins form the s.d sign to the shopping center and still coming are way it take 10 mins and I could have hit it with a rock.  it was moving behind the movie screen by now other people are seeing it some were point  at it.  it went behind the screen  and must have made 90 degrees turn east and came rite over the top of the screen about 15 feet above and just hovered.  by this time people were going nuts women were screaming and cars tearing the speaks off it was just crazy.  then the west screen did the same thing it was about 20 to 25 foot in diameter it was just hovering there for at least 5 mins by then about.  10-15 cars stayed after it left some of us stayed and talked. now I am a big chicken but  I wasn't afraid.  I think I in shock.  It did not hit me until I get home.  to this day if I tell someone the whole story by the end I am shaking. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
