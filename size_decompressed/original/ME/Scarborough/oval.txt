Over thirty orange silent lights all grouped and traveling east at the same speed.;2012-09-15 08:24:00;10 minutes;Over thirty orange silent lights all grouped and traveling east at the same speed. I was taking out compost and noticed multiple orange disc's flying in the same direction from west to east of my point on Broadturn road, Scarborough. I called to my wife & son Austin who were in the kitchen, they came out to the driveway in disbelief.  I witnessed over 30 orange UFO's all traveling together and the same speed approx 250-300 mph. They all traveled to the east and disappeared one after the other. I witnessed the about five of the same lights a few months ago..., but this time there were over thirty of these flying objects. I am a 32 year vet in the military and have seen nothing like this before.;43.5825000000002;-70.3513000000005
