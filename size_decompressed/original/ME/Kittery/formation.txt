A VERY fast light point object that was viewed for about 10 Seconds.;1973-08-01 04:00:00;10 Seconds;Summary : A VERY fast light point object that was viewed for about 10 Seconds. I was standing topside watch aboard the USS Will Rogers (SSBN 659) with another petty officer named Duncan (can't remember last name). We witnessed a VERY fast brilliant object moving across the sky behind the lights of Portsmouth, NH and head out to sea (the Atlantic). Within two or three minutes after the sighting, we witnessed a flight of four F-15's take off from Pease AFB on full AB. They proceeded in the same direction of the object. Thinking this was significant, we made a note in the topside log and notified Pease AFB operations that we could confirm the sighting. The next morning the ship's XO called us in and told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to play games with the Air Force and were then ordered to ammend our logbook entry. We were used to seeing F-15's take off from Pease during day and night. The object was many times faster than an F-15. It also did not in any way fit the profile of an F-15's afterburners. All we saw was a point of light moving very fast out to sea. This incident has remained a question in my mind because of the reverberations it caused in the Navy and Air Force chains of command.;43.0939;-70.7404
