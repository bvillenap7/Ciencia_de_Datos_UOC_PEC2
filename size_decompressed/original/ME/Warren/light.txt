Flashing green orb;2020-01-29 01:00:00;40 minutes;Flashing green orb I am a police officer and I was parked on the side of the road in the dark waiting for traffic.   I noticed a light in the sky almost directly in front of me which was brighter than the stars around.  It appeared to be flashing white and green and my first though was that it was just a plane or something.  But then 10 minutes passed and it hadn’t moved.  Then another 10 mins and then 40 minutes later I’m still watching the same fixed flashing light in the night sky.  I took out my monocular and when I looked at it through that I could see that it was actually rainbow.  I attempted to take a photo with my phone but It was too small and too far away.  Now I’m writing this and it has been almost an hour and it’s still right there, it hasn’t moved at all.;44.1275;-69.2474999999999
