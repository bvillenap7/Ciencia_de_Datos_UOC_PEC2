Cylinder shaped craft with bright diamond shaped light above;2006-12-18 12:17:00;2 minutes;Cylinder shaped craft with bright diamond shaped light above On December 18th 2006 at 12:17 p.m., I was driving on Route #1 when I noticed what I initially thought to be an aircraft.  I continued to observe it and it appeared to be missing wings and a tail .  It also had a diamond shaped bright light above it.  The craft was cylindrical in shape and silver-gray in color.  I pulled over to the side of the road and took a photograph of the craft.  I still do not know what it is or if it was even a craft.  It remained in the same location for about two minutes.  I was looking at my camera photo and when I looked back up in the sky, the craft was no longer there.  Photo available for identification purposes only.;44.1275;-69.2474999999999
