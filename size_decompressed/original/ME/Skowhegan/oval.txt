Brilliant white lights around it with intense red light on top. It was an artic January night when my husband and I were going to a relative's house.  We were getting into our car when my husband noticed this object in the woods across from our driveway.  It was hidden behind the trees at first, then it came above the tree tops.  It was enormous!  It was oval shaped with huge white lights around the perimeter of the craft.  Including red and white lights on the bottom of the craft.  There was an unusual brilliant red light on top of the craft, it was a blood red color, very strange!  The craft darted up and down through the trees within seconds then all of a sudden the craft shot up over to the west and disappeared.  We were both terrified!  There has been alot of UFO activity especially in this area for the past 4 years, but this by far, was the closest and scariest encounter we have had!  There was no noise from the craft, but the strangest thing of all was when it was darting over the trees, my husband called out come closer so I can get a good look at you and it would come closer!!  I'm just glad I found this web site so I can let people know that this does happen anywhere and we are not alone!;44.7772;-69.6976
