I looked up towards the sky and I could see and object coming towards me at a very high rate of speed. It stopped over some trees it was disc shape with a white glow there was no sound.  I could see it hover very slowly.  As I was watching it I noticed another one coming again at a high rate of speed it stopped to one side of the first one. One thing I noticed is the speed they were going but how fast they could stop. After a short time one of them headed towards the same way it came from it took off without turning like a plane would have to or helicopter. Then the second one left the same way.  It was a clear night.  I was very close 150 yards and the objects were above the trees not very high. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Answer to your questions:   They came from the East and went back the same way.  I started working this part time job in 1984 and also worked in 1985 so I guess it could have been in 1985 I am not sure.  I went to full time work in 1986 and I am sure it was not  during that time I was working full time for the church.  I hope this will help you in some way.  I have never said much about it as I figured no one would think I was telling the truth anyway.  I have no doubt to what I saw it was very clear that night and it wasn't that far away.  Thanks for getting back to me.  ((END));44.7772;-69.6976
