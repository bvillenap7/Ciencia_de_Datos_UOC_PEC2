Large v-shaped lights hanging in the sky;2013-02-06 18:00:00;10 seconds;Large v-shaped lights hanging in the sky Driving S-SE just before leaving Skowhegan on Route 104, saw to my left, apparently heading N-NE, a triangle-shaped collection of solid, non-blinking colored lights hanging in the sky.  The craft seemed at least big enough to be a C5 transport ship, but wasn't moving, or was moving very slowly.  I could see stars around the craft, so it wasn't a blimp.  Very familiar with the area and the sky around here and the lights were very noticeable and different.  I saw nothing when driving in the exact same place and in the same direction 3-4 hours later.;44.7772;-69.6976
