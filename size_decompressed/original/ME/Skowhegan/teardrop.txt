Around 2:10 in the after -noon we were dropped off a swimming hole in the woods. Our Parents soon left, and we dipped in the water. Not after 2 min. did my younger cousin point out a medium size teardrop figure hovering to the East of of us. The craft stayed put for about 20 min. then without notice the craft turned in a total circular motion and left. Not making any sound,..wow!!!!;44.7772;-69.6976
