They were traveling similiar to what a jet would appear as. They all were heading southerly from the north. Couldn't hear anything, they were in the hundreds. I was very shocked by this. I was told that it could be mapping satelites or reflections of some kind from distant cities or cars off the atmosphere or ionosphere. I am no astronomer so bare with me. I watched in amazement, tried counting the groups and guessing at a # of them like you would jelly beans in a jar. The distance I could see them in was roughly 3 miles to the lefÝ and right, from the top of the small mountain I was on. Looked like points of light. Couldn't hear anything maybe a faint hum at the most but nothing significant. Color was white just like a star would appear. Actually meshed in very good with the stars that clear night.;44.0969000000002;-70.1863000000006
A pair of red objects moving in parallel following 5 min later by a group of 3 red objects in parallel;2005-11-10 21:30:00;10 min span;A pair of red objects moving in parallel following 5 min later by a group of 3 red objects in parallel Last night while outside I noticed two red objects fly in parallel across the sky very quickly.  It was much faster than any plane or meteor.  There was no trail.   The objects were reddish and spaced far enough apart to know it wasn't planes/jets.  Again they were moving too fast to be that.  They were moving from west to east.   Then all of a sudden one of the objects makes a 90 degree turn in front of the path of the other object and they they both move off into a southerly direction.  There were some meteors last night but those were easy to differenciate.  Then probably less than 5 minutes later we see a group of 3 red objects coming from the same direction all in parallel.  Again moving very quickly.  They start to move back and forth in front of each others paths.  I had never seen anything like this before and I usually go out when meteors are expected so I can watch the show.  What we saw last night was nothing like I've seen before.  There were no trails, no blinking, no sound.;44.0969000000002;-70.1863000000006
string of orange flame colored lights over Lewiston.  ((NUFORC Note:  Aerial lanterns, launched from a party at Bates College.  PD));2007-08-10 22:00:00;1-2 minutes;string of orange flame colored lights over Lewiston On 8-10-07, my father and I were in the process of repairing an electric trolling motor on a bass boat in preparation for a tournament the following day.  I had backed the boat into his garage so we would have some light to work by.  At approximately 2200 hours, my father said What's that up in the sky?  I looked out the open garage door, toward the northwest, to see a string of 6-8 orange flame colored lights traveling in a north easterly direction across the sky.  They were evenly spaced approximately 20-30 feet apart.  I stepped out of the garage and walked out into the gravel driveway in an attempt to get a better look.  I estimate that lights were between 300-500 feet from the ground traveling between 5-10 mph.  It appeared that the lights were attached to something as they moved in a linear direction with absolutely no change in speed, direction, or elevation.  My initial impression was that a small airplane was towing a rope with lit torches attached, through the night sky.  That thought quickly faded as there was absolutely no airplane related sounds what-so-ever during the entire time of the sighting.  In fact, everything was quiet.  I made a conscious effort to try and identify the shape or sort of object these lights were attached to without any success.  No sort of craft was visible or heard at all either between or near the lights.  After approximately 1-2 minutes, the lead light began to fade and went out.  My impression is that it looked exactly as if a torch had simply burned itself out.  The remainder of the lights dimmed and appeared to burn out, 1 by 1, from front to back in a similar fashion.  When all the lights went out, we returned to working on the boat.  Neither of us could explain what we had just seen.  A short time later, as we were talking about the event, we could smell a strong odor of gun powder very similar to the odors after a 4th of July fireworks display.
