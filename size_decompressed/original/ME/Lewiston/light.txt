My friend and I were playing Wiffle ball when A very bright, orange ball appeared out of nowhere, probably a few miles away. It hovered there for about a minute when another ball appeared. The two merged and instantly disappeared, going out with a flash of yellow light. We were stunned. It was about 1:00 pm.

A light in the sky similiar to Haley's comet during sunset 10/26/04 Tuesday evening around 18:00 hours  ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2004-10-26 18:00:00;2 hours;A light in the sky similiar to Haley's comet during sunset 10/26/04 Tuesday evening around 18:00 hours This was seen during sunset as I drove from Monmouth to Lewiston on rt 202. I would say it was in the South West sky.  It was similiar to haleys comet when I saw that only it was gleaming orange with the sun setting.  It did not appear to be moving. If it was it was very slow unnoticeable.  From a distance at times it looked like a huge cessna airplane but then more like a comet.  My daughter noticed this first, we drove back to get our camera and binoculars and lost sighting in the darker sky at sunset. It was very beautiful along with the full moon that night.

Fast moving bright light that stopped suddenly;2012-11-02 23:15:00;5 minutes;Fast moving bright light that stopped suddenly I was leaving a convenience store on Main Street in Lewiston. Wondering about the weather for the next day, I looked up to see if the cloud cover was still solid.  For a moment I saw nothing, then thought I saw a bright star. I quickly realized the “star” was moving at a fairly rapid pace, heading from south to north.   As I watched, I realized there was no break in the clouds – it was solid overcast and still raining lightly.  As I ran through what the object might be, I thought jet plane at first. It was much too fast for a small prop plane or a helicopter, but the speed could have looked like how a low jet might appear.  I don’t think it could have been a plane though, since it was only a solid bright white light – no flashing lights light an aircraft would have.  I thought it must be a satellite, but thought a satellite would be much higher, and above the high cloud cover.  Then, the thing that puzzles me happened. The object had been clearly visible the entire time, and was moving steadily, with no variation in the intensity of the light, or the direction or speed.  Then without slowing, it stopped short and remained stationary.  I stayed and watched for about 5 minutes, and the thing just stayed there, perfectly stationary.;44.0969000000002;-70.1863000000006
White light moving across sky that stopped and stayed still.;2012-11-09 23:15:00;5 minutes;White light moving across sky that stopped and stayed still. As I was leaving a convenience store, I looked to the sky, wondering if the storm we’d been having might pass and the weather improve by morning.  There was solid cloud cover, and it was raining, as it had been for hours.  Then I saw what I first thought was a star, and figured for a second that there was a break in the clouds.  I quickly realized the light that looked like a star was moving at a steady, fairly brisk speed, heading south to north. I first thought it must be an airliner, as it seemed high enough and fast enough that it couldn’t be a small plane.  It was only a steady white light, looking much like a star.  If it were a plane, I thought it would have the typical flashing lights this did not.  Then I thought it may be a satellite, but I thought a satellite would be at a much higher altitude, above the cloud cover. Then the object just stopped and stayed stationary.  It didn’t take time to slow,  it was moving then it stopped suddenly.   I watched it for about 5 more minutes before getting in out of the rain and heading home.  For the entire time I watched the light, it was clearly visible.  I was not up into the cloud cover at all. I am unable to explain what kind of object would be able to be that high, move that fast, be able to stop that suddenly, then stay perfectly stationary.

White Non-blinking light traveling fast.;2012-12-15 17:10:00;2 minutes;White Non-blinking light traveling fast For the last four nights my family and I have seen a white non blinking light traveling west to east moving quite fast. Tonight,we all saw another brighter or lower non blinking light traveling east from the moon to the west, It moved from the moon all the way across the sky to the west in about one and a half minutes.  Not a plane,and I don't believe satellites change the way they orbit earth?;44.0969000000002;-70.1863000000006
Bright star like light disappears as it moves south.;2013-01-14 20:10:00;30 seconds;Bright star like light disappears as it moves south. Saw a light that looked like a star moving south, then it disappeared as I looked at it. It then had very faint colored lights that may have been blinking. The bright light vanished right as I began to observe it.;44.0969000000002;-70.1863000000006
Star sized object moving very fast across sky.;2015-11-04 17:15:00;5 seconds;Star sized object moving very fast across sky.  I was outside at night at Geiger Elementary in Lewiston, looking south toward Thornscrag, when I noticed a bright star sized & colored object moving across the sky in a straight line at what appeared to be very high speed.    There was no sound.   I observed the light move across half of the visible horizon, then disappear.  The speed was steady, and may have even been increasing…much faster than any plane or jet.  The trajectory was completely flat.   I have seen many meteorites/shooting stars and it was definitely much different than those. I was with another parent talking and I said, Oh my God, look at that!  By the time the parent turned around to look, the light disappeared.
