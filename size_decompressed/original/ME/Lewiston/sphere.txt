Multiple lighted spherical objects moving in a linear array from southern horizon to northern horizon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Lanterns.  PD));2007-08-10 22:05:00;5 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness on two occasions, and we deem him and his wife, one of two other individuals with him at the time, to be excellent witnesses.  He contacted the local newspaper, which wrote an article about the incident, and it was determined that the luminous objects were aerial hot-air balloons, released by students of Bates College during a celebration there.  We express our gratitude to the witness for his having submitted such a nice report, and for his having pursued the matter by contacting the press.  PD)) Multiple lighted spherical objects moving in a linear array from southern horizon to northern horizon At approximately 10:05 PM on August 10, 2007, my wife, my mother-in-law, and I were standing in our yard in Lewiston, Maine, and looked into the sky. We suddenly saw an array of about 10-15 lights, appearing sequentially on the southern horizon. They were in groups of one to five, and were traveling along the same trajectory from south to north at a constant velocityâ€”about the speed of a small plane. It was difficult to assess their size or altitude, but they appeared to be fairly large and spherical, with a single light in each shape. The lights appeared to be glowing, similar to waxing and waning yellow-colored flames. They were much larger in appearance than any meteors, satellites, or space shuttles we have ever seen in the past. As they approached the northern horizon the lights dimmed until the lights were no longer visible, but the outlines of the objects gradually faded after the lights dimmed.  The entire episode lasted about 5 minutes.;44.0969000000002;-70.1863000000006
