Third clear night  UFO sighting observed in Western sky with red and greenish blinking lights, Lewiston, Maine.;2000-08-25 22:30:00;60 min;Third clear night  UFO sighting observed in Western sky with red and greenish blinking lights, Lewiston, Maine. My husband and I sit on our back porch many evenings. For 3 of the past clear nights we have observed in the sky an object we cannot identify. This evening it was first seen again at about 20 - 30 degrees off the horizon, in the western sky. The object appeared to be round in shape, with blinking red and green lights. It would move slightly about 5 degrees first to the north,then south,the east and west. Then it moved very slowly downward, as if perhaps it might land somewhere. We could still see it in the sky, but very low. We called the tower at the Portland Jetport to report tyhis unusual sighting. We asked if anything could be observed on radar. The gal told us there was only one plane that could be seen on radar. We also saw this same plane she was referring to. This was NOT the same object we were observing, but another.There was nothing else shown on radar. The gal suggested we call your center  to report sighting. My husband and myself are both self employed professionals. We are also intelligent, sane people. We both are in our early fifties. We have clear minds and do not suffer from any mental problems, dementia or hallucinations of any kind. Neither of us consume alcohol, and were of sound mind when we saw/have seen this object last three clear nights. We can supply you with references if necessary.;44.0969000000002;-70.1863000000006
Bright light in constellation Cassiopeia.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible flare from Iridium satellite?  PD));2013-08-06 22:50:00;8 seconds;Bright light in constellation Cassiopeia Daughter and I were looking at stars and I pointed out a fuzzy area north of the constellation Cassiopeia where I thought a star cluster would be when suddenly a bright light appeared in the lower triangle of the constellation and moved slowly east until it dimmed rather quickly.   Earlier we had tracked the ISS across the sky from  horizon to horizon so we had a pretty good idea how a big object in geosynchronous orbit would look like and behave - this was MUCH brighter, appeared out of nowhere and grew dim before it even got anywhere near the horizon.   It unnerved both of us - looked a lot like a space ship had kicked thrusters for a moment before moving on.;44.0969000000002;-70.1863000000006
My two friends and I saw 3 white dots fade in and out of visibility that moved at fast speed in very close proximity to each other.;2020-05-02 17:00:00;5 minutes;My two friends and I saw 3 white dots fade in and out of visibility that moved at fast speed in very close proximity to each other. On Saturday, May 2, 2020 between 5 and 5:15PM in Lewiston, ME I saw 3 white dots moving around in the sky, right below a very visible moon. It was 60 degrees and sunny out but the moon was visible and I just happened to be admiring it when I saw the 3 dots.  I watched them for about 10 seconds before calling my house mates, who were also outside, to see what I was seeing. The 3 white dots were moving in close proximity to each other, horizontally and diagonally. They didn’t cross each other’s paths but moved closer and farther away from each other intermittently.  Three of these UFOs were visible simultaneously at first, then we only saw 2 at a time for the remainder of the encounter.  They faded in and out of visibility, sometimes with none of them visible at all for brief moments.  They reappeared in different positions in the sky compared to when they went out of focus.  We got a little freaked out because their position in the sky descended as time went on.  We watched this for about five minutes.  The whole time, there was a very long, patchy cloud visible under the moon in an otherwise blue sky.  Once this cloud disappeared, so did the multiple, moving white dots.  We continued looking at the sky for more activity but didn’t witness anything else after the cloud dissipated.  We didn’t collect any video footage even though we discussed trying but, none of us wanted to reach for our phones on the table a few yards away and miss anything.  We also doubted if we could capture it.  It’s all we’ve been able to talk about and everyone we’ve shared it with has told us it was just “Starlink.” No! No it wasn’t!;44.0969000000002;-70.1863000000006
Large flash of light turned into a circle??;2020-08-14 08:45:00;10 minutes;Large flash of light turned into a circle?? The object we saw was very large at first, It was a large red/yellow light.  It lasted for a split second and then the light stopped.  It started going moving strangely, like a zigzag motion except it was just getting higher while doing the zigzag motion. it looked like a satellite but it was going way to fast and they don't generally move like that.;44.0969000000002;-70.1863000000006
