I heard a noise similar to a sound of a plane. I looked behind my house and saw this object lower then usual planes that fly over my house. I walked a little bit closer to it and notice that no red lights were flashing like usual planes do. I saw 3 corners that were lit up in a regular light color and in the middle a light was beaming down...  It was a weird sound, it didnt sound like a plane or a helicopter, it was more deep and less engine like..  I felt like i was in a movie. Behind my house is probably about 4-5 miles of woods, Theres lots of hills and trees.  I honestly believe that it was one. The night had clear skys and very few clouds.  The object was black.
