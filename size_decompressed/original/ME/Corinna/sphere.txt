Silver ball darts across sky and disappears.;2016-08-19 15:35:00;10 seconds;Silver ball darts across sky and disappears On the way home from a trip around Central/Western Maine, I was driving North on Route 7 from Newport to Corinna, I noticed a silver object in the sky, tracking from East to West, about 10 miles away across the horizon.  The weather was sunny and clear and the object seemed to reflect the sun.   I watched the object for a few seconds and the best way I could describe it was it faded away in the direction it was headed.  I didn't see it again after that. I also noticed multiple jet trails in the sky before and after the incident but didn't notice one coming from the object.;44.9227;-69.2348
