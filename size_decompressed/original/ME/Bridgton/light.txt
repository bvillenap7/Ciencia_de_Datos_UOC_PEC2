At around 8:45 p.m EST a friend pointed out to me a slow moving light in the sky.  The craft was traveling about 100 M.P.H. due east at a height of around 5000 feet.  I fly aircraft and this craft had none of the tell tale aircraft lights.  It was a pure, unblinking white light about 10 times the size of a normal star and a lot brighter.  My friends dismissed it as an aircraft and went indoors while I watched the craft for several more minutes until it disappeared out of sight.;44.0515;-70.7294000000001

I live up in Maine and on December, 24th around 6:30pm I saw several different orange red pulsing lights ball shaped.  No distinct pattern to them at all, as they were sprawled out in different areas around each other but not a super close distant.   It blinked from orange to red at times while other lights never changed at all.  It sometimes left a Orange-ish trail behind it, but not all of the lights did the same thing.   It lasted for about five to several minutes before disappearing one by one.   My step father, Father, Mother,Sister, and I all saw it together.;44.0515;-70.7294000000001
Silent round bright yellow light changing formations.;2016-03-12 20:00:00;30 minutes;Silent round bright yellow light changing formations I saw a bright yellow light hovering in the trees outside my bathroom window.  It hovered in the same area for approximately thirty minutes.  It seemed to change it's shape from a round disc to a formation of long round lights connecting to each other.  It was moving around in the same area as it changed it's form.   The color remained the same bright yellow light.  I live alone and was afraid it was moving closer to my window and I felt that it knew that I was watching it and I noticed the windows in the back of the house were lit-up from the bright.   I finally investigated and was in shock watching this for twenty minutes.  I got up enough courage to get my camera and when I returned it was gone.;44.0515;-70.7294000000001

A small speck of white light, dimmer than the visible stars around it, moved in a linear fashion.   Within a second or two, it began to zip erratically through the sky, maneuvering in an unconventional manner at a high rate of speed across the sky, slowly disappearing after several seconds.;44.0515;-70.7294000000001

I was out in the backyard in Bridgton, Maine, when I looked up next to a big star right above the tree lines, right next to the star was a bright light that floated up and disappeared.  Then another light came right after and did the same thing and then it started repeating this cycle of lights going straight up then disappearing. I was with a group of people of more than 10 persons. They all saw this as well. This lasted for awhile,Iâ€™d even say for more than 10 minutes. The UFOS were silent,you could not hear anything.;44.0515;-70.7294000000001
