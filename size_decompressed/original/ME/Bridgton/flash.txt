This light flashes and zig zagged in the sky to the right of me and then disappeared behind the trees and I can no longer see, and then while walking in the direction I was seeing the light flash.  The light came back and flashed one more time in front of me, but way closer then before and looked like a fire in the air and then disappeared and I could not find the light again once it flashed in front of me that last time.   The past week and this week I have been seeing these things for the first time ever.;44.0515;-70.7294000000001
