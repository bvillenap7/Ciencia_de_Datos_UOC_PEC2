Nighttime rendevous turns into a UFO sighting;2007-12-07 12:00:00;0:00;Nighttime rendevous turns into a UFO sighting I was with my boyfriend sitting in his car in a field.  We were in the backseat of his car when I noticed a strange light come from outside.  I sat up and opened the door against my boyfriends wishes, he wanted to continue or little rendevous.  So I looked out and a bright light flashed in the sky again.  At first I thought it was an airplane, but it was such an odd shape and color.  It was diamond shaped with a pointed front in back, or so it looked and it emitted a silvery glow. It last for about 30 seconds and disappeared.;44.6604;-70.1364
