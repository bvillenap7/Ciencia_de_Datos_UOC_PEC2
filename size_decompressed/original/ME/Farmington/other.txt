As it descended around 50 ft, a red diamond shape also appeared (Red light also believed to be part of said craft).  The lights went on and off at separate times.  Amazing!   It was plain as day, the light it gave off was very solid, unlike a street light, or a light from a drone.   It hovered (70 ft from the ground) for three to four minute (Wasn't counting,  I was too astonished).  It did a one eighty and slowly, but surely disappeared into the night sky.  At my angle, the light slowly got smaller and smaller.  It ascended at a 90 degree angle and was completely gone within a few moments.   If it wasn't for the wait in line to return an item at Wal-Mart, I would have missed this anomaly.  Has anyone else seen anything similar?   I have a few more unexplained sightings that happened in the last 9 years.  In all cases,  My phone or kindle were dead, so I was never able to capture any of it on camera.;44.6604;-70.1364
