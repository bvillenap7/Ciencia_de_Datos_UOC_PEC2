7 bright orange fireballs travelling easterly over Farmington;2013-11-14 19:00:00;10 minutes;7 bright orange fireballs travelling easterly over Farmington My husband first observed about 6-7 orange fireballs upon exiting the house and gazing easterly into the sky.  He called to me to see the objects.   Within just a few seconds there were just three left.  The three that remained appeared to be travelling north easterly and eventually disappeared in the cloud cover.   We then observed another directly over the house that appeared as if it might fall upon us.   However, it continued in the same direction as the others, silently moving through the sky.    We often observe planes, however we also can hear them. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD));44.6604;-70.1364
