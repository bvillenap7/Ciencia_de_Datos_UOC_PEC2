Triangle shaped 3 white lights silent hovering.;2012-02-21 22:00:00;3 minutes;Triangle shaped 3 white lights silent hovering. There's this loud noise that sounds like a siren of some sort, my husband said it sounded like an 18 wheeler‘s tires howling as if it were going 100 mph.  He went out to see what it was, and over our neighbor's lawn headed to south there's this huge plane or ...... something.  He called for me to come and look.  It was 3 white lights, one at 12:00, and one at each 10:00 and 2:00. In the center area (kind of below the 12:00 light)was a red blinking light.  It was shaped somewhat like a stealth fighter jet.  After the initial noise, It became silent.  No noise, no wind, no smell from exhaust, nothing.   My husband said it was probably 100 ft. wide at the wing (if that is what they were) span.  It went south just over the treetops, not very high. It got to about ½ mile from here.  It stayed right there for what seemed a long time, but was probably about 5 or 6 seconds, hovering.  It started moving and faded. Anyone know what it was or what's going on? I don't remember ! having air craft around here.;45.0658;-69.0899
