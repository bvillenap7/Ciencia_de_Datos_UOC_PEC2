I noticed an extremely bright light out my bedroom window which at first I thought might be a big star, then I looked harder and noticed it was making bizarre movements and had colors.   I went and grabbed y cell phone hoping to zoom in on it and also grabbed my spouse to witness it.  When I zoomed in on the object it lost all detail.  The craft was spherical, moved in different directions and at times remained idle in one spot.  The lights were red, green, yellow, orange and blue that I remember.   It stayed for a very long time and then proceeded to disappear by going straight up into the sky.;44.3738;-69.2202
