At the time of my sighting, I was a two-year veteran of the USAF.  My home of Caribou, Maine, at the time, was home to Loring AFB, a Strategic Air Command base.  I have since retired from the Air Force after 21.5 years.  The area is extremely rural and remote, Caribou being the largest city in northern Maine.  I had returned home on leave and was out on a date.  We parked near some railroad tracks and had a view of the horizon, as created by hilly potato field.  The sun was down but you could make out the horizon line.  I saw a circular light approximately the size of a dime held at arms length, travel across my field of vision, above the horizon line.  It was green, hazy on the edges and traveled across my field of view and disappeared below the horizon in 5 to 10 seconds.  Being familiar with aircraft and having seen numerous meteorites in the area, I determined that it could not have been either.  It moved to slow to be a meteorite and had no characteristic lights that would mark it as an aircraft.  No sound was heard.

It was a clear night, without moonlight, to illuminate the night sky.  I love to watch the night sky and all the constellations as they shine brightly in northern Maine on a dark night.  There was no noise (aircraft or vehicle) breaking the silence.  I was under a tall lodge pole pine tree waiting for my dog to come back.   I walked out from under the tree and looked up into the northeast sky at about 01:00 when I saw a large white light about the size of a full moon.  It was at an altitude of several thouand feet.  I stood there in amazement at the brightness of the light.  I just stood there, watching, wondering, where it came from and where it would move too.  After about 2 minutes the light moved upward at a high rate of speed, disappearing within 2 to 3 seconds.  The light has never reappeared since this crisp morning in November 2002.  Every time I look up in the sky, I wonder, when the next contact will come. The now closed Loring AFB is about six miles from my home.  The object (light) appeared to be hovering over the old base.  Even though the base is officially closed, the military still has a presence on the base.;46.8706000000001;-68.0204
