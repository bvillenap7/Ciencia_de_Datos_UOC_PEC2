Hovering object with odd light formation- UFO or blimp;2008-10-15 19:00:00;2 minutes;Hovering object with odd light formation- UFO or blimp This was a nighttime sighting, and I honestly don't believe when anyone reports to have seen something at night, because normal things look strange.  However, what I saw to night was either a blimp or something out of the ordinary.  I doubt there was a blimp flying over Maine tonight, and that is why I am reporting this.  The object was eithering hovering or flying at a snail's pace- too slow for a normal aircraft.  It was so bright that it must have been very close, thus movement was easy to judge (or lack thereof).  It appears to be one object, but it had two sets of lights. The configuration of the craft adds to my belief that it was something strange that I saw, but I cannot really describe that configuration here.  The lighting set up was not that of any typical aircraft (excluding a possible blimp).;44.2142;-69.7978
