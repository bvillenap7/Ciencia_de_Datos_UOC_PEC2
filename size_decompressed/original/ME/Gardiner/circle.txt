Later that night my Mom and I saw it agian do the same thing, only this time is hovered and looked like it was either rotating or blinking. It was around 11:30 and we were all watching t.tv. in the living room. I got up to get a drink and looked out the kitchen window and saw an amazingly bright yellow circle hovering about 1,00 feet above the treetops. I thought it was aa star so i went back into the living room and started watching t.v. again.  My brother went to the kitchen and got a drink also and he also saw it and told us to all go there quick. So went over and looked out the window and the yellow object was going striaght up and down.  it did this for 6-10 minutes and then dissapeared. We talked about it for a while and then my Mom's boyfriend and his son had to go so we went to bed.  About half an hour later I got up and looked out the hall window and there it was doing the same thing.  i went into my Mom's room and she was satill awake. i told her and we watched to gether for 3-5 minutes, this time though about halfway through it stoped about 10,000 feet off the ground and hovered and we couldn't tell if it was blinking or rotating.
