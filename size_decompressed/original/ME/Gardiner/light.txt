The object seen flashed a singular main light which almost looked like a star, a slight reddish flicker to it.  It moved irregularly, looked like it was rolling in place. 2 planes had passed it and it didn't move.  As it started to fade out we drove after to observe to the next town over.   We passed a cop as we had gotten further out.  We reached a field to observe it.  It looked like it was shooting out something with mist around it (almost looked like a shooting star just dropping it, this happened at least 3 times).  It started to fade out again so we started following it again and our cars engine started acting weird (it never goes over 2.5 RPMS going up to 40 MPH) it was well over 3. We turned around to head home because of this as as soon as we did the car was fine! We took a turn west before we headed home and saw the same police car.
