Hovering then doing a oval orbit.  Watch for about 10-15 minutes.  Disapeared behind tree line. My Family were all watching T.V. and I went to the kitchen to get a drink and I looked out the window and off in the ditance I say a disk-like object in the sky at about 3-5 thousand feet.  I looked at it for about a minute.  It was hovering then it started to move up and down.  I called everyone over and they all looked out the window and agreed with me that they saw it.  We all watched it and it started to move up and down in kind of a oval orbit.  Then it stopped, hovered for a bit, then it started sinking down below the trees.  Later that night I was walking down the hall and saw it again and me and my Mother wathed it for about 2 minutes then it disapeared.;44.2142;-69.7978
