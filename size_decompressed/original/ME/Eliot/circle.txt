My other friend and I looked up and saw a tan circle in the orange sky almost like it was trying to mimic the color of the sky.   As we were looking at it for about 15 seconds it started to turn black.  It was as if the backside of it was black and it was slowly turning for about 5 seconds.  After it was black for about 10 seconds it just disappeared.;43.1317;-70.7873
Red light dropped straight in from sky to near horizon, and rapidly changed direction to south east - viewed from central Eliot.;2016-01-05 23:15:00;3 seconds;Red light dropped straight in from sky to near horizon, and rapidly changed direction to south east--viewed from central Eliot. While looking out my bathroom window at Orion, a reddish/Amber light dropped straight into the atmosphere slightly to the right of the constellations view, to just above my view of the local tree line.  From there it rapidly changed direction (south-east) and disappeared.  Beside the color, and lack of sound, I found its trajectory odd, as it didn't move like any plane or chopper I'd ever seen.   There was no arc to its travel, like a meteor would have. It dropped in perpendicular to the horizon.;43.1317;-70.7873
