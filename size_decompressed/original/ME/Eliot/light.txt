Bright yellow and red flashing light anomaly just above tree level. Steady movements at times, speeds up. ((anonymous report));2017-10-07 20:00:00;2 hours;Bright yellow and red flashing light anomaly just above tree level. Steady movements at times, speeds up and then stops occasionally.  Past 3 nights have been seeing it over Kittery/Eliot/Dover between 8pm and 10pm.  At first glance it looks like a large drone.  Very good view the other night on Dover/Eliot bridge.  Very strange for a low flying object to be so big. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.1317;-70.7873
