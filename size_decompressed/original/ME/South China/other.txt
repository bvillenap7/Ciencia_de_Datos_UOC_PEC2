I would like to state for the record that I was not the person who witnessed the UFO, however it was brought to my attention by people who knew about my interest in such matters. The object was sighted very close to the setting sun, initially it was thought to be an aircraft off in the distance, as it wqas thought that it was reflecting the sunlight off the surface of the craft.  On later discussion we decided that this could not be the case because the sun was behind it and therefore could not be reflecting off it. The object which was oval in shape was seen to decend to below ground level, we were on top of a hill overlooking China Lake, and we later determined that it must have been many miles in the distance as the object was so small.  It didn't move at speed or stop and start it's descent, it just gradually descended to below the hight we were observing from. There were potentially 100+ obserevers, however many of these were in medatation at the time.  And I myself who is normally engaged in the persuit of scanning the skies for things which are out of place, had my head burried in a book.  I do remember however, that there was very little cloud cover over the sky and the day had been very hot (over 100 degrees).
