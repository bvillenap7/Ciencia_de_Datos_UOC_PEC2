Stars that would take off and move to other locations or vanish.;2013-08-04 22:30:00;2 hours;Stars that would take off and move to other locations or vanish. My wife and I were out side enjoying the night sky,  We started to see these stars just up and move in all directions, there would be 1 to 5 at a time.  Some were bright some were dim.  Others would blink really bight gold lights and the others would either vanish or take off at a high rate of speed.  We see these most every night we go out at all times of the night.  My wife downloaded a satellite tracking app on her phone and there were none in sight.  Even they were there were to many and the didn't have a certain direction. Some would go one way then stop and go back the other way.  They went from west to east and south to north or just the opposite.  Very very high in the sky and no noise or blinking lights.  We saw at least 30 over a 2 hour period last night.  A few were connected by a beam of light.  My wife's phone would not pick them up due to there high elevation.
