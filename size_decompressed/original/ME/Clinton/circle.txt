green object trailing haze;2006-01-16 23:00:00;2 seconds;green object trailing haze It was around ten thirty at night I was laying in bed, watching tv. It was a ice cold, clear night. My window is one the left side of my bed. I looked out the window real quick and got ready to shut my eyes when I opened them again I saw a greenish object shoot thru the air it was a perfect circle. It almost had a greensih tail too it, it could have been a comet or something, but the real unusal thing is that it when up than down towards the woods in a split second. After that I got up looked around alot longer, nothing was seen again accept I saw eight to nine planes flying thru the air after that happened. It is not the first time I have seen unusal activity during the cold winter months. I am going to try to get my video camera to see if it happens again. Also these last 2 days my truck will not start. And the baby moniter, and alarm clock make high pitched buzzings noises in the middle of the night.;44.6439;-69.5339
