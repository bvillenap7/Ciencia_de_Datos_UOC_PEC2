Bright star;1993-06-01 05:30:00;10 seconds;I awoke for work one morning and as my usual routine I let the dog out first thing and I also look at the sky to check the weather. As I opened the door I noticed a very bright star in the southeastern sky. It seemed larger then a star should be and it suddenly seemed to grow in intensity as if it had noticed me looking at it. I took a quick second to refocus my eyes and as I did that it arced away upward, like a hook, so fast i could barely see it disapear. The previous night I had been playing with a flash light aiming it up at the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
