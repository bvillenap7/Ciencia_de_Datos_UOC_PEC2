Disturbing sightings in Maine.;2013-08-15 11:00:00;1:00;Disturbing sightings in Maine. 3 friends and I sat on the porch.  We witnessed a white thin cigar shaped craft in the north eastern sky, heading west north west.  It had no contrail it disappeared behind a cloud for several minutes, after 2 of us made hand signals.  Pointing, first at our eyes and then it.  It appeared to have little to no visible wing, flying at a high altitude and was silent.  it looked to me, what I would expect a drone to look like.  it came out of the cloud heading the opposite direction.  after a 1-2 minute trip to another cloud it exited the same cloud about 10-15 seconds later  it exited that cloud accelerating hard with a solid contrail, I didn't know our boys had jets or thrusters of any kind on our white drones, and had heard that they were invisible to the naked eye.  so what I saw did disturb me enough to report this tonight.   also in the same area of the sky 2 bright objects flashing from red, blue and white.  similar but not the same distance from my town in the same direction but a bit further away and lower to the ground always at night.  It seems to move faster than other stars, the closest one. it also appears to be doing zigzags, up down and at times quick up down or slanted movements.  in the north western sky, the second object flashing the same three colors is west north west in what looks like a straight line i am not centralized in the triangle you would get if you were to draw straight lines connecting me and the 2 objects .2 witnesses some times 3 or more.
