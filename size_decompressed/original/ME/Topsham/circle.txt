Quick moving, non-blinking light moving across the night sky above Topsham, Maine.;2015-07-22 22:00:00;5 minutes;Quick moving, non-blinking light moving across the night sky above Topsham, Maine. We were standing outside, looking at the stars and discussing inter-dimensional beings.  My boyfriend was saying how sometimes, when thinking about projecting energy into space, it increases the probability of a sighting.   As I look up, I notice a light moving across the sky quickly, with no blinking lights.  My boyfriend said the only thing that would move similarly would be a drone, but the object was too high up to be one.  As we watched, the craft seemed to vibrate intensely for a moment before slightly changing direction and becoming further away and dimmer.  We continued to look after it was out of our sight and then went inside.;43.9799;-69.9364
