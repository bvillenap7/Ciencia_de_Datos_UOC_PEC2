1996 encounter with bright lights on country road in Topsham, Maine.;1996-06-30 21:00:00;2 hours;1996 encounter with bright lights on country road in Topsham Maine At 9:00pm my boyfriend left work in Brunswick, Maine, on a Sunday night, summer of 1996. He should have been home 15 mins later.   He came home 2 hours later, drove into yard and fell out of the car.  I helped him up.  He was white as a sheet, no energy, and told me he was driving the River Road by open field when extreme colored lights of such intensity blinded him from behind the trees, he had to pull over. (blue, red, white etc. )   He next found himself on the ground next to car and it was 10:30 pm.  He had no recollection of what happened.  He made it home  under great difficulty.  He never seemed the same again did not want to be reminded of incident and died at 66 in 1999.  His health was not A-1, but his health suddenly declined.  He did say the colored lights were still there when he awakened and they flashed straight down into in the field.;43.9799;-69.9364
