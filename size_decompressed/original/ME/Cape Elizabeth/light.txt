The object was a pulsating light and the shape was unknown.  It appeared to be five miles out over the ocean and was moving slowly north by northeast.  After watching it for a few minutes, the police officer directly south of my town contacted us and told us that there was an object over the ocean, approximately five miles out over the ocean heading our way.  Two police officers were sent to the beach area where they were able to see the object.  The Sergeant guessed that it was 500 feet off the ocean between 3 to 5 miles out over the ocean.  When it was directly off our coastline, the object made a sudden turn South and disappeared.  A week prior to this sighting, a caretaker of a local lighthouse called our police station, quite upset.  He asked to have an officer come see him regarding an object  that was actually floating on the water approximatley 100 yards off the rocks. He saw the object from ground level and ran up to the top of the lighthouse to get a btter look.  When he got to the top of the light house, the object took off from the water straight up in the air.  The object lifted at a high rate of speed, not consistent with a helicopter or anything he was familiar with.  He wanted to see one of our officers to confirm that he had not been drinking and was sane (he had to make a report to his supervisors).;43.6017;-70.2354
