The lights were really dim, just barely a dull glow. The object was about 1000 feet high and never gave off any sound what so ever.I just slowly went overhead traveling directly north. There was snow on the ground and it was cloudy, so the lights from the town reflected off the snow and lit up the bottoms of the clouds so I could see the craft very well.;46.1207;-67.8601
