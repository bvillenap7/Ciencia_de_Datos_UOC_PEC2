We ran out front and coming from the SW to NE were 7 orange orbs flying approximately 300 ft above the rooftops. No sound was heard and the objects seemed to be moving 600-1000mph.  Behind those 7 orbs came 5 more orbs same altitude and speed.  All 12 orbs did a corkscrew curve into a huge thunderhead.  The accelerated quickly into the cloud.   After that, it down poured like I have never seen before for only 2 minutes then the weather turned beautiful.  That same night I was in my backyard having a fire and I heard what sounded like footsteps in the neighbor's back yard.   I stood up and went over past the hedge in my yard and on the border of my neighbors yard and the next yard I saw a figures silhouette in the trees.  I saw the head and it seemed about twice the size of a human head.  The figure was all black because of the time of night, and the light from the second yard downs window.   I felt an intense feeling come over me.  Not fear but like it was trying control my emotions.  I whistled and the creature tan away I heard five bipedal footsteps before it ran through the treeline two yards down that is like 50 feet in five steps.   I felt sick to my stomach afterwards for five days and when I went over to where I saw the creatures head silhouetted in the light from the neighbors window the creature had to be at least seven feet tall.  It fealt was up to no good.   I need to be contacted by an agent if possible because there are other related events to this one.  I was visiting my mom in Maine I live in Vermont.;46.1207;-67.8601
