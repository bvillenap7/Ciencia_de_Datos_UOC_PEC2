A white, orb like craft moved over Rangeley Lake from the west to northeast.  This white orb moved quickly across the large lake eventually went out of sight.  When the craft dissapeared it did not follow the curvature of the earth.  It simply got smaller and smaller and then shot out of sight.  Very eerie.  This sighting turned one skeptic into a beleiver.  My first sighting.  Very cool. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.  We have assigned an arbitrary date of July 9, until we hear back from the witness.
