Watched 3D cube for 2 min out office window.;2004-06-09 13:00:00;2 min;Watched 3D cube for 2 min out office window. Craft Description: from out of my office window I observed what I thought to be a large bed sheet (king sized) caught in the wind about 300 yards away and approximately 150 yards off the ground. I thought it peculiar so continued watching. After approximately 15-20 seconds I observed that the motion of the bed sheet was very odd. The only way to describe what I was viewing at this point of the encounter, is to say that I was looking at a large bed sheet that was caught in a rising thermal and being tossed around as it rose. However, the bed sheet was traveling across my field of vision in a perfect horizontal path. As it approached, instead of the bedsheet being swirled around in a random pattern, I could see that it was revolving with some regularity around an unseen object and traveling in a deliberate path. When the bed sheet got to within 100 yards from me I could CLEARLY make out the object. What I saw was a 3D cube floating above the ground oriented standing on end. I dont believe that it was rotating. The only way to describe the outer surface of the object is to say that if you took video footage of a large sheet caught in a rising thermal (the sheet fully spread out and tossing in the thermal) and projected that footage on the outside of the 3D cube... that is what I saw. I watched this object for some 2 minutes and saw it very easily. It moved from NW to SE and my guess to speed would be 100 - 175 MPH. It was slow enough that I could see it plainly and watch it as it finally went out of site over the south easterly foothills outside my office window. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
