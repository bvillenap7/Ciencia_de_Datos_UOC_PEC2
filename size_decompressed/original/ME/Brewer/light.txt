fast moving aircraft aproaching a strange light.;2006-10-13 05:00:00;4 min;fast moving aircraft aproaching a strange light. My coworker and I were outside on our break when we noticed a fast moving  aircraft heading across the sky it caught our attention because the airspace is not usually flown threw because of the Airport close by.  we saw that the aircraft was heading towards a bright light in the sky that was growing brighter... as the fast moving aircraft got closer the Light seemed to dim and then shoot into the sky up and away from us at a very fast speed...  the aircraft that was heading toward it then turned around and headed back the way it came... we both thought this was very strange...;44.7845000000001;-68.7560999999999
