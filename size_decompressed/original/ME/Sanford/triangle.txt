Low flying low speed stealth military aircraft;2012-07-16 00:00:00;4-5 minutes;Low flying low speed stealth military aircraft Strange low flying (500ft?) low speed (&gt250mph) aircraft that was lit up with white lights in a triangular shape, (The aircraft may have not been triangular itself but just the pattern of white lights) it also had a red flashing light in the center. There was also 1 set (2 lights) of white search lights in the forward position (Its how me and my mate first noticed it as it briefly (2-3secs) lit up the area where we were standing, then proceeded to scan the ground ahead of it. It was NOT extraterrestrial as it was powered by a jet engine, but a very very quite one, as we could hear nothing till it was right on top of us, then you could hear the faint sound of its propulsion. It was most definitely a stealth military aircraft either a stealth drone or possibly the F-35 as they are testing the air-force version in Maine right now.  And the town meeting my friends father attended (East Wilton) he was told they were going to be flying very low around 500ft so this could very well be that. I must say that till the point when i actually heard the jet wash (very quite even right on top of us) I thought it could be something really interesting but i have no doubt it was military... Either way a very cool site to see! If its lights were not on we would have never have noticed it!;43.4279999999999;-70.761
