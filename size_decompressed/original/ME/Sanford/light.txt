We were having a fire and saw a very bright cone shaped light above the tree line, it stayed for a minute or so then vanished.;2009-09-19 19:45:00;1-2 minutes;We were having a fire and saw a very bright cone shaped light above the tree line, it stayed for a minute or so then vanished. It was Saturday, September 19th, around 7:45pm. I was sitting around a fire with my Husband, Brother in law, 2 nieces(ages 2 and 5), my daughter(age 2 1/2)and 2 other friends when my brother in law saw a bright light in the sky. He said, Whats that?! We all turned to look and saw a very bright light hovering above the tree line. It was almost like a giant spotlight in the sky that was triangular in shape. It stayed there for about a minute or 2 then slowly started to fade/drop? It just disappeared.  There was nothing around for sound other then the crackling of the fire. No sounds of any type of air craft, just that one bright light. It reminded me of a movie, I was almost expecting to see a cow raise up or something.  We attempted to take photos with 2 different cameras. One camera cought only darkness and the other is so filled with orbs its hard to see anything. We all truly feel we saw something very unusual. Wheather its a UFO or not is to be determined by you but we all know what we saw and it ws something I will never forget. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));43.4279999999999;-70.761
