Long trail of slow-moving lights through the night sky.   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-25 20:35:00;30-60 seconds;Long trail of slow-moving lights through the night sky. My friend and I were outside her house near the ocean tonight, watching the sky and talking about UFOs.  Oddly enough, as we’re on this topic, we see a long trail of lights moving slowly through the night sky toward the ocean (northeast).  There must have been about 100 of them.  They were in perfect single file, some spaced further apart than others, and had the appearance of very bright stars.  They were moving horizontally.  It was strange how in sync they were, moving at the exact same pace.  They also moved much more slowly than you would expect.  We were completely blown away.  Of course we took out our cameras, but they couldn’t quite pick it up in the dark.  I managed to take a screenshot of the video I took and adjusted the brightness so you can see one frame of them (I will be emailing in the photo).  There were many, many more than what I captured with my camera, but it gives you the idea.  Eventually they disappeared at this one point in the sky, one by one! , until they were all gone. I’ve never seen anything like it before in my life, and I have no idea what it could have possibly been.;44.3738;-68.2448000000002
