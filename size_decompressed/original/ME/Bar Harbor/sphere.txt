This object made absolutely no sound even though it would seem by the size of this object and the speed it was going that it would make some kind of sound.  We at first thought that it was a meteor, but the ones that we had seen it the past had never been so bright green. The object passed over our heads and disappeared behind the mountains (near the Acadia National Park area).  We were very surprised and had never seen anything like this before.  This object seemed very close although we could not precisely judge the distance.  This object was so bright that when it disappeared behind the mountains, it left a huge silouette of the mountains behind it. The object was bright green.  No sounds, lights or sparks were seen coming from the object.  It passed from ahead of us literally over our heads then disappeared behind the mountains in back of us.  The object left no trail behind it which seemed odd to us considering the speed. The object was spherical in shape.  My friend Steve is a student in Bangor, Maine presently studying broadcasting.  I am a nationally registered EMT and working on a unit part-time while continuing my education at Southern Maine Technical College.;44.3738;-68.2448000000002
