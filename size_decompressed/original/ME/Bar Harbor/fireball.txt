I am a 14 year old B average student.  My mother came in and told me that she saw somthing outside.  I looked out and there it was.  It stayed for about 20 seconds.  It was hard to make out but hade four blinking lights and was moving very slowly.  It had the shape of about an audio tape.;44.3738;-68.2448000000002
UFO appeared as a shooting star at first, then burnt a red trail and stopped in midair.;2008-08-22 23:30:00;5-10 seconds;UFO appeared as a shooting star at first, then burnt a red trail and stopped in midair. It was pitch black out with clear skies.  Me and three other people where on board a large schooner sailboat watching the sky.  We saw some shooting stars here and there and then I saw what I thought was a shooting star.  It had a white trail behind it like shooting stars have but then it started to burn red instead of white.  Then suddenly it stopped for a second completely.  I couldn’t make out what it was.  It was just a red fire ball and then it bounced across the sky in a very erratic pattern this did not leave a trail.  It clearly wasn’t propulsion driven.  It was incredibly fast.  Then it disappeared.   I called out to my friends and was so amazed by this however to my horror none of them witlessness it.  It was very disappointing to have been the only one to of seen this.  I have no clue as to what this was.  I see satellites all the time and shooting stars and of course airplanes.  This thing had astonishing speed and moved which ever way it wanted to.  It was amazing.;44.3738;-68.2448000000002
Red and orange fireball in sky;2012-08-15 19:44:00;3-5 minutes;Red and orange fireball in sky Red and orange fireball rose straight up in the sky very quickly then it seemed to be moving towards our direction.  It eventually stopped and hovered in the sky then  disappeared.  This was over the ocean in bar harbor.  My daughter and I witnessed this and could not believe our eyes.  Behind us there was a lady on her hotel balcony and we asked her if she saw it too and she said she did and described it the exact way that we saw it!;44.3738;-68.2448000000002
