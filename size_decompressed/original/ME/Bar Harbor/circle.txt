Round, bright, white, objects, jetting sporadically back and forth, up and down, in the night skies. Several Brilliant white round objects, jetting off at extreme speeds and reappearing, as if they were playing tag. While on an East coast car vacation, nearing Bar Harbor, Maine, friend and I had pulled over in a National forest parking area to get some sleep after driving on the road for several hours. Ready for some sleep, laying down in front and back seats of a Plymouth Duster, looking out the car windows, we were watching these objects playing tag in the sky.  We suddenly were energized enough to drive on to Bar Harbor, near civilization. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));44.3738;-68.2448000000002
