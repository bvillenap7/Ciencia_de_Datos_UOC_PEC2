Three orange/amber lights flying in formation North over Falmouth ME;2013-08-30 20:55:00;3 minutes;Three orange/amber lights flying in formation North over Falmouth ME We were driving from Route 295 on Falmouth Road towards West Falmouth.  We saw 3 objects in the sky that were an amber/orange color with some red color, in the sky.  The lights were steady with NO blinking.   Two objects were in front and one was trailing halfway between the two at the front making a triangle.  The lights stayed in exact formation as they passed over us heading north.   There was no sound.   Several cars pulled over to observe. I have never seen anything like it in my life.   The lights continued north until they vanished over the horizon.  They were much much brighter than any starts in the sky.  About 10 times larger than a star appears.;43.7340000000001;-70.2625000000001
Multiple orange lights across sky.;2013-11-02 19:45:00;Unknown;multiple orange lights across sky As we were heading south on 295, it was completely overcast and we observed several orange/red lights in the sky which stretched completely to the western horizon.  These lights numbered at least 12, but possibly numbered as many as 20.   Each moved independent of each other and in many different directions some moving in and out of the low cloud cover.  It became most interesting since we actually drove underneath these lights meaning they must of been low and moving particularly slow.;43.7340000000001;-70.2625000000001
White bright lights flashing in a row of lights, vanished, then came back with bright red lights.;2015-06-14 22:00:00;10 minutes;White bright lights flashing in a row of lights, vanished, then came back with bright red lights. Watching TV in bed and noticed flashing light in the sky outside my window.  It was white and bright and appeared to be flashing down a row of lights.  There were 2, one was higher up then the other. I had my husband look, as I wasn't sure what I was looking at.  We stood in the window looking at these two very bright flashing lights in the sky.  They moved up and down and stayed in placed, then they were gone, just vanished as if a switch had been shut off. With in a few seconds, they had reappeared as red/orange lights, very bright.  One appeared to be moving closer.  I looked away as I didn't really want to see what I was seeing.  My husband, however, continued watching until they vanished.
