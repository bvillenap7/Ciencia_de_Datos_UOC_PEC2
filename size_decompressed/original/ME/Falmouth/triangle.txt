Four soft glow orange lights, three of them in a triangle with a trailing fourth light, 100 feet up slowly moving;2014-06-14 22:23:00;4 minutes;Four soft glow orange lights, three of them in a triangle with a trailing fourth light, 100 feet up slowly moving We were driving on Interstate 295 Southbound, when three orange lights appeared on the right side of the car, about 100 feet above, just entering the tree line.   Then a fourth trailing light to the right of the triangle it was transparent due to the fact that clouds could be seen in between the lights, so maybe four separate orange lights.   The orange was like a street light but a much softer glow.   We think they were Fire Lanterns.  Pretty incredible site though.;43.7340000000001;-70.2625000000001
