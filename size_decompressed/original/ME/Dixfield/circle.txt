Green Circle gets chased, leaves cloud of red haze behind.;2003-07-05 21:00:00;45 minutes;Green Circle gets chased, leaves cloud of red haze behind. I was sitting in my kitchen, playing some games on my computer, when i heard this racket outside. It sounded like serveral jets flying around the area. I got annoyed after a short time and went outside to look. I got outside and looked skyward, seeing about 5-7 aircraft (planes) circling and chasing one circular orb. They attempted to fly along side, but could not manage. After about 35 minutes, the planes left, and the craft stood still in the air for a time, shot straight up (presumably, got smaller and smaller) and before disappearing dispersed some sort of red haze. My brother and neighbor came home 5 minutes later, and related the exact story to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));44.5548;-70.4241
