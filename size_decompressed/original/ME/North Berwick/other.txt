9 dark orange orbs floating in eastern sky, in formation.;2013-08-21 20:30:00;10 minutes;9 dark orange orbs floating in eastern sky, in formation. After leaving a class at church, my wife & I pulled over, along with a half dozen other vehicles, on Rt. 4 to witness 9 dark orange balls of light moving from south to north in the eastern sky.  They appeared to be at different elevations & maintained their symetry (sp?) without straying too much.  Occasionally moving up, then down, then moving up again. The event (after we stopped) lasted about 10 minutes.   One (retired?) couple remarked that they'd lived nearby all of their lives and had heard about different sightings similar to this, and scoffed at the reports.  One observer told me that he was a retired Air force pilot & that he'd never seen anything like this before but had heard all kinds of stories from other pilots.  He seemed unfazed by the incident.   We were all in awe more than fear.;43.3254;-70.7212
