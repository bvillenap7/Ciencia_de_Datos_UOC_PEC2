Bright blue flash lit up the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));2012-02-28 22:10:00;2 minutes;Bright blue flash lit up the sky I was leaving to go to Sanford, ME, and right as we pulled out of the driveway, the sky lit up for a split second bright blue, not around us, but above the tree line. We were a bit stunned and my girlfriend ask if it was just her who saw it, but I did as well, a minute down the road I saw orange/yellow lights, I believe 3 that were visible, moving toward Sanford/Wells area.  No longer could see it once we got onto Route 4. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));43.3254;-70.7212
