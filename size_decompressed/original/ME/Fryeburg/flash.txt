Flashing light over Black Cap;2009-09-25 21:00:00;1 hour +/-;Flashing light over Black Cap This was the 4th or 5th time I was able to see these lights.  From the 302/5/113 traffic light in the center of Fryeburg - look from where NAPA used to be.  Locate Black Cap to the west of where you stand.  Follow the ridge line south to the next shelf, Middle Mtn?, look up anywhere from 15-45 degrees.  What I saw was a very slowly moving, appeared to be stationary unless you gauges it's location using a fixed object, one night climbing then dropping, others dropping, another fading from view then returning.   The object at first appeared to be a bright very flashy star, upon closer inspection there were colors present in the 'twinkles' - green, red, orange & white.   In conjunction with the flashing light disappearing another light to the north was noticed - strong white light, on then off.;44.0302;-70.9614
