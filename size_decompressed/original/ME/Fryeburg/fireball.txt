Orange Orbs over Fryeburg, Maine.;2014-06-21 21:00:00;5 minutes;Orange Orbs over Fryeburg, Maine. While Driving on Route 5 in Fryeburg, Maine, I witnessed 6 orange orbs in the sky to my left. While pulling over to get my camera out, 4 of them simply vanished. I was able to film 2 of them for a good minute or more. There was nothing in between the two orbs, I am positive it wasn't from planes. Also, in the video you see one of them simply fade out and the last remaining orb then starts moving around erratically, and I could not keep my camera on it.;44.0302;-70.9614
