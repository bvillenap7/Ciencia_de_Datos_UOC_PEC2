6 slow moving balls of light disappear into a cloud;2011-08-16 20:10:00;3-5 min.;6 slow moving balls of light disappear into a cloud Walking on the beach, my family and I watched 6 balls of light slowly move in an easterly direction.  At first we watched to see if they were airplanes, but as they entered a large low level cloud, they never came out the other side.  I watched for another 10 minutes...  Plenty of time for something to pass thru the cloud, but nothing did. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.524;-70.389
