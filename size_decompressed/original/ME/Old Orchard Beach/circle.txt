Suddenly the craft changed directions, dropping lower, then went sideways for a spell, then it came to a complete stop.  When it moved again, it went up, and appeared to kind of bounce slowly as rose, then started moving sideways, back towards the fireworks. As the show ended, rather abruptly, without the usual grand finally (sic.  finale), the craft veered North, until it was right above me.  I could see that it was round, surrounded by red lights.  It then changed directions again, back towards the beach, slowly.  It was over the water when it suddenly dropped, VERY QUICKLY, and then vanished into thin air. This is not the first time I've seen unexplained flying objects over the water but it's the closest, and longest, I've seen one.   There is nothing else it could be other than a UFO because nothing moves through the sky (and disappears) like that.  It was crazy.  Freaked my kids right out.;43.524;-70.389
