Fast moving featureless white cylinder shaped craft with no sound.;2018-09-28 15:20:00;10-15 seconds;Fast moving featureless white cylinder shaped craft with no sound. My husband and I had stepped out of my Mother-in-laws's home to see my husband's uncle's new truck.  I happened to gaze up at the trees behind the house looking east and spotted a fast moving object that was moving from right to left above the trees.  That would be in the direction of southeast to northwest.  It was a long cigar or cylinder shaped object with no wings, fins, windows, or propellers.  There was no sound coming from the object.  I gazed away for a couple of seconds to try to get my husband's attention, but he was occupied.  I looked back at the object and it was just beginning to disappear behind the trees where I lost sight of it. My husband and I live in coastal South Carolina and are used to a lot of civilian and military aircraft going over regularly.  This thing was a long white featureless and soundless object that was moving steadily without any indication of propulsion or other features.  It looked like a long pure white sausage.  The sky was sunny and perfectly clear that afternoon.  It happened too fast to get the attention of the others present.  I have no idea what it was.;44.5542000000001;-69.6179
