followed home by low flying light;1998-04-05 01:00:00;5 minutes;followed home by low flying light while traveling home from job. Lived outskirts approx. 6mi. Turned onto road which was uphill. At top of road, saw bright orange/white light that appeared to be sitting low in the sky. began to panic (have seen this many times),knowing that home was not far, I began to speed up. The light became very bright and seemed to be traveling very low (treetop high) and alongside my car. Speeds of 55-60mph were reached and it stayed along the side and just over trees. The light was very big.A short distance from my home, I began to blow my horn, hoping that my husband would hear and look out the window to see what was going on. When I got to the end of our drive,I turned off my lights and pulled into the driveway(a steep downhill,under pine trees).The light slowly 'floated over the trees and sat at the edge of the field nearby.I ran to the door and began pounding. My husband reached the door  in time to see it slowly move away easterly.;44.5542000000001;-69.6179
Odd oscillating white lights above Maine (Sighted in central Maine);2011-08-07 00:41:00;1:41;Odd oscillating white lights above Maine (Sighted in central Maine) At 12:41 AM est a white oscillating light was seen from Winslow, Maine, towards the southern sky towards south southeast.  The light started off very bright brighter than anything else in the sky.   During the sighting 2 commercial planes where spotted which seemed to be flying at a much higher altitude on a typical linear course.   Unlike the light that was spotted which seem to be doing circular, elliptical, as well as zig-zag patterns during its course.  The light also began to change in brightness becoming as dim as the stars that surrounded.  At 1:07 AM est a second light much dimmer than the first light was spotted towards the southeast which seemed be imitating the same patterns and behavior as the first light that was imitating.

Light chasing another.;2015-09-06 02:50:00;1 minute;light chasing another I was walking down the road through a parking lot, heading to the store, when I looked up I saw what looked to be a white satellite light, but moving in an irregular pattern changing course.  Another light appeared with a bright flash behind the path of the first and started chasing it following the same wave pattern.  Then both disappeared with a flash, the first object slightly before the second.;44.5542000000001;-69.6179
2 lights blinking, controlled upward movement.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-02 05:00:00;Hour;2 lights blinking, controlled upward movement. Saw 2 lights blinking in the sky.  I first thought stars or airplanes but even though they first stayed in place they did move a little.  Then one started to move up.  Not like anything I have ever seen.  It was a controlled upward motion.  The other one stayed in place and it was bright and flashing.  My husband woke up and I showed him the two lights.  The light that had moved up wasn't obvious to him.  However the other brighter light staying place but flashing he noticed and said it seemed odd.   My husband and I are professionals, we are not believers but we also believe in possibilities.   We aren't sure what we saw, what we are sure of is we haven't ever seen anything like it before.
