I was about 7 or 8 and my brother was about 10 or 11.   One night i snuck into my brothers room to play and we saw a bright light coming from the window.  Our back yard faced the nuns convent and they had a tennis court the light light up the whole outside like day light but seemed to hover over the tennis court.   We starred for about ten to 15 minutes and then it was gone just gone dissappered. we stayed up drawing pictures of aliens and ufo's thinking that must be what we saw.  A couple weeks later my science teacher came by the house to speak to my parents to see if anyone saw anthing unusual cause people in winslow were claiming they saw a ufo. we never told my parents till after they thought we were crazy.....but after my teacher came to the house that confirmed it for me that we did see one cause so did other people.
