Triangular shaped craft over rt 46;2009-12-21 15:30:00;4-5 min;Triangular shaped craft over rt 46 We were going home from Bangor when a huge triangular/slice of pie shaped craft floated from west to east in front of us, across the road,and out over the treeline and out of site.   It made no sound, it had lights in its underbelly, the sides and back looked....industrial like...it was drab grey in color...it looked like it had been underwater a long time because it had strings of kelp, and barnicles attached to it. It was moving so slow that I couldn't understand how it stayed flying. We saw this thing in full daylight, about 1500 ft or so away. I'd like to talk to someone about this, I can't seem to get it out of my head. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via;44.6029;-68.7782000000001
My husband and I were driving down Route 46 in Bucksport in December of 2009 when we saw something in the distance that looked strange.;2009-12-22 16:00:00;@ 5 minutes;My husband and I were driving down Route 46 in Bucksport in December of 2009 when we saw something in the distance that looked strange...it was slow moving and just over the tree tops, very large, greyish in color and triangle shaped with lights on it.   We watched it move toward us and slowed down to get a better look, it got quite close from what I remember, I tried to get my husband to stop but he thought we would get a better look at a different angle but when we got to where he wanted to go it was gone... I had just been to the hospital and had a procedure done so I was on some pretty serious medication (which had actually worn off by this time), so my memory isn't as good as I would like it to be but I remember it being huge and did not look like anything I had ever seen before (or since) and it made no noise and did not look like anything that should even be in the air, especially going as slow as it was going.  It had lights on it but I don't remember the color or shape of them, all I remember is that I couldn't take my eyes off of them.   I don't remember alot of details about it but know it was not something ordinary...  My husband cannot get it out of his head and I don't have a great recollection of it and am not sure why... You are welcome to contact me for more details or whatever... Thanks;44.6029;-68.7782000000001
