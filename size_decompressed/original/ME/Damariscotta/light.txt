Standing a dock on the western side of Pemiquid Pond two lights seen traveling very high up in tandem eastward their motion slowed and hung stationary for a moment, using a green laser I indicated the lights to the group, using the beam to circle the two stationary lights, one seemed a faint red or pink, the other a larger brighter white, the smaller red light was trailing the larger bright white light and after I had circled them with the beam they slowly faded from sight. we all were impressed and awestruck at the mystery of it and the feeling of interaction with it.;44.0278;-69.5092
