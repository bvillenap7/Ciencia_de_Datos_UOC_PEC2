Speed (very rapid and parallel to horizon) and light (solid bright white) rule out any known aircraft, and the size and direction seem to rule out a meteor.  Altitude is difficult to determine since we are unsure of its distance from us.  Object was viewed through east and south facing windows by two of three people in the room.  Observers were a 31-year-old male and a 72-year-old male.;44.0278;-69.5092
