Black dot the size of a star appeared and began to shine a green light intermittently as it flew over the Kennebec River to N.;2016-07-17 15:30:00;4 minutes;I was sitting on my back porch, watching an eagle flying over the Kennebec River when suddenly this black dot the size of a star appeared and began to shine a green light intermittently as it flew over the Kennebec River toward the north before disappearing in a thick grey cloud.  I had my friend and my mom both check it out.   Then we saw 2 more black, circular dots just appear out of nowhere and head in the exact same direction and disappear in the very same cloud!!  These two were not shining any lights that we could see.  I have been seeing these strange 'moving stars,' beginning last week.  I saw 6 last night in less than an hour and a half.  In cloudy light polluted sky.;44.6477;-69.6792
White 'stars' that suddenly appear out of nowhere and begin zooming across the sky, sharp turns.  ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites??

Last night, I went out on my back porch and was looking at the sky not even 5 minutes when I saw the first 'moving star' of the evening.  I saw 4 more in the hour and a half I sat out there before the sky got too cloudy to see anything.;44.6477;-69.6792
