Thought to be a plane or helicopter but too fast for helicopter and han one continuous light, none blinking as a plane would have. I detected a light that seemed odd in the sky and called my four co-workers over to see the light.  We thought maybe it was a plane since it was too fast to be a helicopter.  We have planes flying over almost all night long and this particular object just didn't seem right.  It had one continuous light, none blinking, it din't follow the usual flight path of the usual plane and it seemed to fly very close and between other planes flying by.  Eventually it took off, not away into the horizon, but up into the sky. p.s.--I would also like to know more about the tenth planet and the so-called three asteroids heading toward earth.;44.6477;-69.6792
