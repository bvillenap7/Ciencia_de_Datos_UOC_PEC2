Bright light with diffuse edges, flying at high speed, low altitude, no sound, then disappearing suddenly;2000-03-10 19:20:00;5 seconds;Bright light with diffuse edges, flying at high speed, low altitude, no sound, then disappearing suddenly Driving on an unlit road 2 hours after sunset, my wife and I saw a light, brilliant bluish or greenish white at the center with a diffuse halo around it, fly from right to left across the road in front of our car. My wife thought there might have been two lights close together at the center of the object. We could not discern an outline. Our best guess as to size and distance is something about the size of a passenger jet at 500 to 1000 feet altitude, but traveling at least two or three times as fast as we would expect to see a plane move. We were driving north, and the object crossed our path moving from east-southeast to west-northwest. We saw it traverse about two-thirds of the sky, in a straight line. Then it suddenly disappeared well before it reached the western horizon. My wife saw it change color to bright red for an instant before it winked out. Since I was driving, I missed the color change. There were patches of light haze, but stars were clearly visible throughout the sky. I immediately stopped the car and scanned the sky to be sure there were no clouds it could have flown into. I also flagged down the next car that passed. Its two occupants had seen the same thing, including the disappearance and color change. All four of us agreed that we heard no sound from it whatsoever. In fact, these two witnesses had watched it for several seconds longer than we, and had shut off their car's engine and rolled down the windows to listen.;44.4633;-69.319
