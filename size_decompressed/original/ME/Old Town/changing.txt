Indian Island, Old Town ME. (Driving home);2003-04-13 19:30:00;less than 2 min;Indian Island, Old Town ME. (Driving home) My wife, my son and I were driving home around 7:30 pm. when my son of 10 had pointed to a bright light hovering around 70 feet in the air, I pulled the car immediately  over and the object changed from a single bright light to about 12 or 14 pinpoints of white lights in sets of two all along the side of the object. It was long and seemingly sausage shaped or cylidrical. The Twilight made the object barely visible against the horizon.  I quickly rolled down my window to listen for any sounds like helicopters or airplanes since there is an USAF refueling base within 25 miles south of location of sighting. There is also an airport in Old Town for local flyers. The three of us observed there was no sound at all. The object then started to move away and up in to the sky with an extreme acceleration leaving a small vapor trail that quickly diminished within seconds. It was no more then a second or two before it was completely out of sight. The whole occurence was maybe a little over a minute long. My son expressed an urgency to know what it was since it had no sound and moved at such a high speed. He also pointed out that there were no blinking or strobing lights like the small planes and helicopters that we see regularly around this area all hours of the day and night. I was unable to tell him what it was.;44.943;-68.675
