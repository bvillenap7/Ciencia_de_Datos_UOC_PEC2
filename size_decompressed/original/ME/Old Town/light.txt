Approximately ten minutes later, running perpendicularly to the first sighting, what appeared to be a moving star flew over the field, slower than the first. About midway over the field, the light lit up bright white for a few seconds, before continuing on, disappearing behind the trees.;44.943;-68.675

About 10 minutes later, two helicopters were spotted in the sky with their search lights on heading in the direction of where the green light had fallen.  Fifteen minutes after that, another helicopter was spotted heading in the same direction making it a total of three helicopters searching for whatever had fallen from the sky.
