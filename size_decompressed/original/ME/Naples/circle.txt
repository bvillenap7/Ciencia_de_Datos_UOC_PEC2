3 Lights play together over Maine skies.;2002-07-04 01:30:00;20 mins;3 Lights play together over Maine skies. This morning ( 07/04/02 ) at approximately 0130 hours while star gazing with my girlfriend, I noticed a circular white light moving in the night sky among the stars. My first thought is that it was a sattelite until it began to slow down until it eventually came to a stop. Seconds there after, another circular white light, much brighter, started to move towards the first light that had stopped. The first white light then began to move away from the second white light as if it were being chased when suddenly it shot off in a 90 degree angle, unlike any manuver that an aircraft could make. The second white light then stopped again, and began to glow brighter, and then just dissappeared. The event of the two lights took place directly above us around the constellation of the big dipper. Excited and amazed as to what my girlfriend and I witnessed, we decided to stay longer and look for more unusual activity. Approximately 3 minutes after witnessing the first event, I happed to notice another white light, much brighter than the first two on the horizion above hill tops, behind thunder clouds begin to move eastward. It illuminated the clouds it was behind. It to came to a stop behind the clouds, when sunddenly seconds after it stopped, shot out of the clouds vertically towards the direction of the other two lights and dissappeared into the night sky and stars. No further activity was seen in the half our we remained outside after the events.;43.9681;-70.5988000000001
