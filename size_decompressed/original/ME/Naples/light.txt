I was at my grandmothers house which sits on top a hill and has a nice veif of the sky 360 degrees. My dad came to pick me up(He is retired military) at about 19:30 and said there where some weird things outside in the sky, I then proceeded to go outside and look. there were atleast 6 lights in the sky, they did not look like airplanes, the didnt blink, the where pure white, alittle bigger than the stars. We then proceeded to go home about 2 1/2 miles away, I tracked them in the car, and when we got home looked at them again, they were still there, there where also alot of planes flying around, It look as though they were following the objects, but I am not sure. the last time I looked they were still there, that was at about 20:45. I do study ufo's somewhat, and believe that what I saw was not just planes, or stars.;43.9681;-70.5988000000001
