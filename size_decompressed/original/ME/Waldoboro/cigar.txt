red cigar shaped object in sky over Waldoboro, Maine;2001-01-10 16:30:00;10-15-min;red cigar shaped object in sky over Waldoboro, Maine I was driving on route 1 southbound when I noticed a bright object in the sky straight ahead and in the sky. I watched the object until returning to the farm that I drive a delivery truck from. I thought at first of a meteor but there was no tail involved. I also thought about an aircraft yet there was no jet stream coming from it. When I returned to the farm I told my bosses girlfriend to take a look at it. Her daughter and she and I  looked at it out the back window. We got a pair of binoculors to try to get a better view of it as we could not tell what it was. on closer examionation with the binoculars we still had no idea. It was red like it was on fire and a cigar shape to it. We did not see any blinking lights or anything that made it look like a plane. ( I thought it may be a plane with the sun setting reflecting off of it) The object was traveling horizontally in the southwest direction.;44.1036;-69.3666000000001
