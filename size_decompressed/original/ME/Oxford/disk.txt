Hoovering over some trees... it was a disk shape with lights around it, and it looked as though it was spinning slowly, it was hoovering over the trees, i was stunned, i was looking at it and could not move, i wanted to go tell someone, but i was unable to move, i did tell someone the other day, but they just laughed at me, so i felt unable to tell anyone else. until now...there is a sight i can vent..thank-you ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Took the dog outside with a friend, walked out back and heard something like a helicopter whirring. We both looked up and saw what looked like a saucer about 25 feet wide maybe 6 feet tall. At the angle we saw it from, the craft was a large half circle with red lights that gave off a blue aura on either side. My pit tried to pull my friend and I towards the craft but didn't seem scared, only curious.  The craft was very low and hovered for a moment as if it was observing, then left quickly behind the tree line surrounding our building.;44.1093;-70.5055
