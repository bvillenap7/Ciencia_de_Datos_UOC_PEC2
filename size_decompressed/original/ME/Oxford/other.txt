UFO leaving LARGE TOWER;2018-10-30 07:16:00;1 second;UFO leaving LARGE TOWER This photo shows a hexagonal UFO, next to a very large tower.  We were trying to take a burst of photos of the sunrise while driving.  Upon later look we saw these two strange objects in the sky, it only appeared in one photo out of 8.  A small hexagonal UFO, with what looked like possible gun turrets on the front is exiting or entering a large tower with a bulbous top that also appears to have turrets.  The large circular part of the tower is held by a thin pole that flares out at the bottom and has another pole protruding from it.;44.1093;-70.5055
