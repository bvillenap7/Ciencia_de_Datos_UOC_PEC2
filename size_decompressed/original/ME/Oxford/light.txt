It had three flashing lights, yellow, green and red. This one object was far away in the sky. 30 degrees east, northeast. I looked through the binoculars at it. What struck me about it being unusual was that it remained stationary in the same position, not moving. It had three colors, red, yellow and green. I thought it may be a helicopter at first, but when it was still in the same position after 15 minutes to a half hour, I thought it odd. The lights flashed. It was not a star, it was not a plane and it was not a helicopter. What it possibly could have been was a satelite, if they have flashing tri-colored lights. It appeared the next night in the same position. When I checked it a few hours later, it was father to the south, as our earth moved in its rotation.;44.1093;-70.5055
