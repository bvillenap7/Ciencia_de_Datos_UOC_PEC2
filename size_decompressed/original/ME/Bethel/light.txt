A bright star made right-angle turns without deceleration and sped down over the horizon.;1993-09-01 22:00:00;2 minutes;A bright star made right-angle turns without deceleration and sped down over the horizon. My wife and I were viewing the stars outside a friend's home on a hilltop in rural Maine.  I was watching a medium sized bright yellowish star moving slowly in a straight line from East to West directly overhead and was trying to determine if it was a plane.  It appeared to be as far away as the stars.  I asked ((female name deleted)) to look and we both watched as the star, just a steady bright light with no blinking, made a perfect right-angle turn towards the North with no deceleration whatsoever, travelled for around 10 seconds in a straight line Northward, and then made another right-angle turn Westward, travelled in a straight line Westward for 5 seconds and then accelerated and zoomed towards and over the horizon.  At no time did we see sparks or any sort of trail like a meteor would make.  It was just a yellowish star doing something I couldn't since find any way of explaining.;44.4167;-70.8066
Shining object over Bethel.;2015-10-19 13:00:00;15 seconds;Shining object over Bethel. My dog was acting funny like when he wants to go to the bathroom.  I opened the door and hear the animals in the farm next door making noises.  The dog was smelling around, but he seemed confused.  The day was cloudless and somehow there was this shining object and at first I thought it was a plane but there was no noise.  All of a sudden the object stopped completely for about 2 seconds.  After that, it took a sharp right and sped off.  I blink and it was gone.  I still cannot believe what I saw.;44.4167;-70.8066
