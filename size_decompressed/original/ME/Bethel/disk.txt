I noticed that it was not moving and did not look like a plane. I got out my binoculars for a better look. I was fascinated, so, I had my former husband look at this and his daughter. They saw it more clearly than I did.  At his first glance he said that, it looked like a satellite. I asked him to take a closer look with the binoculars. All of us looked at it through them. Out consensus was that it looked most like a saucer. They also thought that it look's like Saturn with the ring around it. All I could see was an extra light. I just checked the sky it is still there. I will probably watch it for a long time tonight if it stay's. It still has not moved. I tried to make a call to you, however, there is no toll free number for you. We have thought of calling the police. I don't quite know what to do to insure that other's see this right now that have not yet. Therefore, I may risk being thought of as a nut and call the local police anyway. It seems a small thing to have happen if other's may witness this. I have always wanted to see one. I hope that this is the real thing. I also hope that somehow I will discover if other's have seen it as well. I have just called two friends to go and look at it too. It was suggested to me that I call our local new'. I'll be calling chanel 8. Good luck with this. Thank you for your time.;44.4167;-70.8066
