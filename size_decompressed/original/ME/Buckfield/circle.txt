Large aircraft traveling slowly just above tree line emitting green and red lights.;2019-12-10 23:41:00;15 seconds;Large aircraft traveling slowly just above tree line emitting green and red lights. I was looking out my bedroom window when I saw a very large aircraft just above the trees traveling at a slow speed.  It had red and green lights on it’s underbody, and was very large.  I ran outside to see if I could get a better look and by that time it was gone. Light pattern (how the lights blinked was very strange and didn’t seem to have a pattern).  The aircraft was making any sound and was traveling with the roadway.;44.2868;-70.3702
