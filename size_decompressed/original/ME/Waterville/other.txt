the star looking object quickly,silently moved from out of the big dipper to orions belt and disapered;2003-09-09 23:40:00;about 2-3 min.;the star looking object quickly,silently moved from out of the big dipper to orions belt and disapered I was looking up into the night sky at the big dipper,it was to my north west.all of a sudden from out of the center of the big dipper( in the middle of the 4 stars that make up the pan)came a tiny white star looking spot that looked like a star,it was very far up there.silently,i watched it go from the big dipper,straight towards the southeast to Orions Belt.it wes moving faster than a plane and i kept saying to my self that it wasn't blinking. i was trying to see if it was blinking,it wasn't.this actually lasted about 20 seconds to a min. maybe.i was very excited.now that i know that this web sight is here i'll use it when i see things...Thank You;44.5542;-69.6179000000001
