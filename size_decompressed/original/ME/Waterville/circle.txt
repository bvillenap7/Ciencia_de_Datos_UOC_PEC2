Movment in the sky;2011-07-02 09:00:00;1 minute;Movment in the sky Well, I just went out side to smoke a cigarette with me girl friend and I happen to look up.  I saw something in the sky.  I look just like a star, but was moving very fast.  There were no blinking light, just a steady constant beam.  It was not a plain or anything that we have created.  I grew up on an air force base, so I know that is was the unknown.   The object didnâ€™t give off a noise, and was too high.  I wish I only new.   I have seen more around here, about the same concept as this one.  They are just lower and brighter.  Thank you.;44.5542;-69.6179000000001
