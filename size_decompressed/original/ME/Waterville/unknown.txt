AT 8:15pm, standing in the parking lot between Walmart and Home Depot,a person called out to me, look[pointing to the sky]southeast direction.  There was a high flying object,moving in one direction, orange.  It traveled some,then disappeared. Then there were 3 flying in format, then disappeared. Then 5 objects ,then disappeared.  There objects kept appearing and disappearing.  There was no sound. i guess they could be helicopters as a logical explanation, but because they were so big, then disappearing and reappearing,then disappearing,then very high up in the sky, then low to the ground in seconds, they looked very odd. Tonight there was a full moon out. I wished there was not otherwise we may have called the cops. I swear on my fathers grave,every thing i say is true.;44.5542;-69.6179000000001
