PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  News article, written by Nok-Noi Ricker, in the Bangor Daily News:   BANGOR, Maine  A city official driving home with his daughter Thursday night saw strange orange-colored balls of light in the night sky over Waterville and called the Bangor Daily News to find out what it was. Shawn Yardley, director of the city’s Department of Health and Community Services, described what the two saw as bright orange dots at cloud level. They looked like Christmas lights, but they were orange, he said Friday, still looking for answers to what he witnessed.  They took up about a quarter-mile of sky and they stayed in place. It wasn’t fireworks, because they stayed in place. Yardley was on Interstate 95 near Waterville and said the fire-colored orbs could be seen on the Oakland side of the highway. People were pulling off the road to look at them, he said.  If my daughter hadn’t been there to witness the same thing, I would not have called. I’ve never reported anything like this. Police and fire officials in Waterville, Winslow and Oakland, as well as the Maine State Police, said they took no reports of balls of light in the night sky, and the National Weather Service reported no unusual weather that could account for the lights. A string of lights [in the sky] is a very common UFO report, Alan Davenport, director of the University of Maine’s Jordan Planetarium, said Friday. Some prior UFO reports have proved to be aircraft flying away, he said. They appear to be stationary because they are so far away. That is what their taillights would look like, Davenport said. Yardley’s wife, Rita, asked him why he didn’t take a picture of the balls of light with his cellphone, and he said he couldn’t because I was on the phone. The National UFO Reporting Center, which has nine postings on its website from Maine for October, has taken reports of orange fireballs from all over the world.  There were no postings on the website for Thursday night. There also are a couple of YouTube videos posted of people filming orange lights in the sky. Yardley said he’s not sure what he and his daughter saw, but he did expect others in the area to file reports. I got up this morning and assumed it would be in the newspaper and on TV, he said.;44.5542;-69.6179000000001
8 parallel orange glowing lights in Waterville night sky 11-1-12;2012-11-01 19:35:00;10 minutes;8 parallel orange glowing lights in Waterville night sky 11-1-12 8 circular balls of light moving in unison.  They were orange/fire in color.  I noticed the lights rising higher in sky at almost equal distances apart in 2 lines running parallel. They seemed to hang in place like a flare would.  One side elevated and lights moved slowly across the sky keeping the line formation. I was looking up across a parking lot in the evening sky.  Noticed the lights. Initially based on its movement I was thinking that it must be parachuters with lights or flames, but realized it couldn't be as they were too precise and there was no plane. It was just above a distant tree line stationed over what could have been the freeway or mid section of the city or perhaps the Colby campus. I moved from spot to go up the street to see better and they were gone completely. I am a star gazer and look up every night of my life, I have never seen anything like this here or anywhere else for that matter.;44.5542;-69.6179000000001
Green light streaks through the night sky in Maine;2016-09-16 20:45:00;4 seconds;Green light streaks through the night sky in Maine. Driving home tonight to a huge full moon to my left, in the sky in front of me appeared a very bright green light streaking across the sky faster than any craft I have ever seen.  The lights were not blinking like they do on a normal aircraft.  This light traveled for a second or two in one direction and then suddenly, without warning, changes directions and travels straight up towards the stars and gets smaller and smaller until it vanishes.;44.5542;-69.6179000000001

The lights made small circles and then moved horizontally in a zigzag pattern and then at a slight angle of maybe 30° going towards the north east direction and then rested at a possible 40° elevation above the horizon.;44.5542;-69.6179000000001
