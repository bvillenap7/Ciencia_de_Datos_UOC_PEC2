My wife and daughter watched an amber colored pulsing object hovering with no sound over the lake. We could see this from our back yard.  The colors were very vivid, I would say about 150-200 feet off the ground.    After watching the craft for about 5-7 minutes it took off unexplainably fast at 45 degree angle. This was an incredible experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));44.4662;-69.859
