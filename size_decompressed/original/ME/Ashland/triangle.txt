At first I thought it was a plane, but when it got closer I wasn't sure.  I got my binoculars and looked, but it didn't look like a plane.  After about a minute of watching it with the binoculars, it suddenly disappeared.  I quickly put down the binoculars and saw that it had quickly picked up speed and was now almost out of view. The craft was a flying triangle.  It had seven lights on it that I could see.  It was flying at about normal altitude for a plane.  The lights were a light blue color.  When the craft made its rapid speed increase, the lights became red.  There was only the one object and all it did was fly in a straight line.  When I first saw it, it was moving very slowly.  About half a minute after it had passed over my house, its speed increased so much that it was beyond the horizon in a few seconds.;46.6550142857143;-68.4004428571429
