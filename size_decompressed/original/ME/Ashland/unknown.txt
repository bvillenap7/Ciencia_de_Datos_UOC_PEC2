Very Bright Aqua Blue Light in Shape of Cone.;2013-11-23 01:30:00;10 seconds;Very Bright Aqua Blue Light in Shape of Cone. Was sitting in my living room listening to Coast to Coast AM on my shortwave Radio, I had no lights on, and was looking out of my Bow window which faces directly North. It was a very rainy misty night/morning.  I am surrounded for many miles in all directions by very thick Forest, except for the the frontage to the North. The Frontage/Clear is in the range of 2,000 feet and beyond that is the tree line, which is mostly forest to the Canadian Border (40 miles).  The cloud deck was very low (700-900 feet) I estimate.   Suddenly, as I just happened to be looking to the NNW, a very bright aqua blue light in the shape of a cone turned on facing directly South!  and then Scanned right below the cloud deck about 20 degrees to the West and just as abruptly as it turned on it shut off (No Fading) of the light.  I have never seen a light source as bright as this lightsource was ever in my 57 years of Life!!  I am always watching the skies here in upper Maine, and have not seen this light source again. But I will still keep scanning the night skies up here,were there is no light pollution at all. Thank You;46.6550142857143;-68.4004428571429
