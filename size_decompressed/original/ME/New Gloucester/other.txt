Bright light large upright being.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  Possible hoax.  PD));2008-10-25 01:27:00;25 minutes;I was exploring in a sand pit with two other individuals when I decided to explore a bright light when I viewed a large upright being. I was with two other friends in a 60 acre sand pit owned by a friend of mine. We were exploring when we viewed an extremely bright light. We were terrified at first but decided that we would regret not investigating. We continued toward the light until it led us into a section of the pit enclosed by thick trees with a opening in the middle roughly the size of large SUV.  At this point we viewed an upright being approximately 8 feet tall, covered in hair with piercing ice blue eyes.  Frozen in fear, we stood as still as possible until it noticed us and bolted into the trees.  I understand how ridiculous this might sound, and I did not go to the police because I did not want to bring negative attention to myself and my family, or be considered insane.  I assure you that everything disclosed in this document is truth. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  Possible hoax.  PD));43.9579;-70.2949
