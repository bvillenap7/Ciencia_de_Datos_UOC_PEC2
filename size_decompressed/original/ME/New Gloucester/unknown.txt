I'm still afraid to look at the sky at night.;1988-10-10 21:00:00;few minutes;I'm still afraid to look at the sky at night. Please understand, this happened many years ago.  It's not what I saw, it's what I didn't see that was/is the UFO.  My daughter and I went to a local store, one evening.  It was comfortable, temperaturewise, this sky was clear, the stars, bright.  I could hear what sounded like the wind blowing, but there was no sensation of wind.  I looked at trees in the vicinity, and there was no movement, just the sound of blowing wind.  I looked up at the stars, and there was a definite area with no visible stars, just pure blackness, and this area was moving.  Definitely not cloud cover, just total lack of light, also, no running lights.  I watched briefly, then went into the store.   Didn't tell any one inside what I had seen, basically, becuase I didn't believe or want to believe that I had seen something.  Whatever it was, it was gone from view when I went back outside.  My daughter didn't notice anything, other than she says now that she knew that I had seen something that botheres/scared me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
