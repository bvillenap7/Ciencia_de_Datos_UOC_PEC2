Bright flash from the woods, followed by intense heat.;2008-10-25 01:00:00;30 minutes;Bright flash from the woods, followed by intense heat. I was driving by myself heading East down Snow Hill Rd. when I noticed a bright flash coming from the woods on the left side of the road.  It was blinding, similar to that of the sun's light.  The heat was very high for about 3 minutes, and I was forced to stop my car because my gauges stopped working.  The entire area was lit up for about 15 seconds, and then went back to pitch black.   At first I considered that there was a bomb that went off in the woods, but there was no noise to follow the light, and it stayed lit a lot longer then any explosion.;43.9579;-70.2949
