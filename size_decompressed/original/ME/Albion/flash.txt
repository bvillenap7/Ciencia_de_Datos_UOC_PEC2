Stationary flashes of varying intensity occurring 10-60 seconds apart over the course of 5-10 minutes between 8:30 and 9:00 pm EST 09/23/17.  This occurred in the south between the arm star Sadalsuud in Aquarius and the stars Scheddi and Nashira in Capricorn in a quarter-sized portion of the sky closer to Capricorn.  Observed for 5 minutes then called a witness to confirm.  Observed a plane passing below lights from east to west around 8:40 followed by a second plane at same degree above horizon passing from west to east around 8:50. Near 9pm Est lights could no longer be seen.  Sky was exceptionally clear.  Flashes seemed to be at a greater distance than planes.  Flashes seemed to emanate from central sources approximately the size of stars.  Some flashes were like brief glimpses of stars, others were faint and lacked a clear central source.  Flashes lasted less than one second and did not move during that time.  Though they did not seem to appear in the same spot twice.;44.5366;-69.463
