As I was watching deer feed in the field behind my house, a small dark sphere of no more than 16 diameter passed quickly thru my yard at an altitude of no more than 3'.  I did catch the object by accident on a cell camera.  It appears to be sliding along on brilliant somewhat flat bright reddish orange glow, as best as I can describe it.   I have noticed the color of this objects glow more than once in the woods behind my house, and became cold just after it passsed my back window, only 30' feet away.
