Intergalactic Fisherman.;1998-04-22 16:00:00;10 minutes;Intergalactic Fisherman My whole crew and I witnessed two lights approximately five hundred feet away.  They seemed to change direction in an instant.  One would fly straight up then stop, and the other would follow, they then dove into the water where their lights would go away.  About 10 seconds later they would emerge from the water and do the same thing over again.   The crew and I watched for about 15 to 20 minutes when they took off to the south probably 50 feet above the ocean, there was no noise, but we have yet to catch anything in that region since?
