Amphibious light in Wayne, Maine.;2009-01-28 23:07:00;4-5 minutes;Amphibious light in Wayne, Maine. I live beside Lake Androscoggin, Wayne. Upon entering my bedroom I noticed a small light shining into the room from outside the window which moved across the room and disappeared. I first thought nothing of it and presumed it must have been light from a car headlight. Then it happened again, but this time the light moved very quickly and zigzagged through the window. Thinking that some kids were playing with a torch, I looked out of the window so see the source of the light. I waited there for roughly 40 seconds before I noticed a light 0.5 miles away on the other side of the lake, behind a small wooded area opposite the harbour. It appeared to be a ball of light, perfectly spherical with what I would estimate to have a diameter of 15-20 feet and pulsed slowly. The sphere moved at a jogging pace and weaved aimlessly through the trees. It would appear to slowly move down to the lakeside and stop there after completing a circuit of the wooded area. The sphere appeared to rotate as it would beam light every 1 minute, which I believe I first saw beaming through my bedroom window. I woke my wife and she was curious to what it could be, so she went to look in my sonâ€™s room for binoculars. By the time she returned to the bedroom the light had stopped, but then over the lake, probable 0.8 miles from the wooded area where we had seen the light, a strobe light flickered and then disappeared over the banks of the lake at 25 mph.
