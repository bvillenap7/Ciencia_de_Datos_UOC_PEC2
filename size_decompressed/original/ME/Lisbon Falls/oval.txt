Lisbon Falls, Maine UFO Sighting during the Day;2012-12-20 15:30:00;1-1.5 minutes;Lisbon Falls, Maine UFO Sighting during the Day My husband and I were traveling west on 196, about a couple of miles from the mill in Lisbon.  We came up on top of this big hill and we looked out on the horizon and saw this silver object in the air.   I am really not sure on how to describe the shape of it.  It was silver in color and the sun was reflecting off from it.  It seemed that the object was traveling fast and it was not too high up in the sky.   As we were traveling west it disappeared because of the trees but then it reappeared again when the area was free of trees and you could see the shape a little better.   I would describe it as halving a dome shape with a round flat surface going around it.   The object then disappeared and we did not see it again.;43.9972;-70.0736
Lisbon Falls, Maine shiny oval object;2012-12-20 15:30:00;1-1.5 mintues;Lisbon Falls, Maine shiny oval object My wife and I were traveling west on Rte. 196 from Topsham to Lewiston Maine.  As we were driving up the large hill about 1.5 miles from the old mill in Lisbon (very near to W Merrill Rd), we witnessed a metallic object flying across the sky.  The object seemed to periodically reflect sunlight.   The vehicle in front of the one directly in front of me slowed down and was beeped at by the car behind them.   As we continued we witnessed the object two more times, once at the foot of the hill by the mill and the second at the summit of that hill by Craft Auto.   The object seemed to be traveling west up the river.  I would estimate it to be a mile and a half away at an altitude of between 2000 and 2500 feet.   The objects shape seemed oblong/oval during our first encounter but seemed to be disk like with an oval top much like a bee keepers hat at our second and third encounters.   The craft seemed to vary in speed as it traveled.  It was not close enough to trees to n! otice if any exhaust was displacing the trees.   There were no crafts on the water.  The time of the incident was 15:30 on December 20, 2012.  The sky was clear except for distant black clouds far on the horizon which was not near the sighting.;43.9972;-70.0736
