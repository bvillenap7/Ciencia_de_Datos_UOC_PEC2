BERWICK MAINE U.F.O;2006-09-08 20:00:00;1 minute or more;BERWICK MAINE U.F.O my son and myself were walking down the road in my neighborhood at about 8:pm when my son noticed a bright glowing oval shaped object moving from east to west.  it stopped hovered and rotated at about 300 ft above my street i live on.it was hard to make out til it rotated.  this object was silent and when it turned you could make out the shape it was oval and matallic and had a vent type duct on top rear like an air intake or fin. very bright light emmitting from the bottom.almost blinding. after watching it for a few seconds the object shot straight up and out til it was out of site. had a light vapor trail just before it left this earth.took a few seconds to leave this earth. very fast. still no sound.  my son and i look at each other wondering what the hell we witnessed .we both felt no emotion of the incident. wasnt excited or scared. maybe shocked.  after about a few minutes there was like small falling this is hard to explain like flame balls coming from the east and ribbons of flame that just disappeared in thin air as they got close to the ground.   ive been a skeptic for years but this is not from this earth , my son and i still talk about it but feel if we tell others they would think were crazy or something .;43.2881;-70.8584
