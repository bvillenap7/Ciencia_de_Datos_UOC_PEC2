Light moving east then west then north............;2005-07-29 22:30:00;5 Minutes;Light moving east then west then north............ I was outside locking my car and looked up and saw a little light (I thought it was a distant star, but it was moving).   My first thought was that maybe it was Columbia.  It was moving in a due east direction about the speed of a passenger jet.  It moved east for about 1 minute then faded out.   About 20 seconds later it returned, heading due west in the same manner.  After another minute, it very quicky turned north (I have seen planes bank that fast) and after another minute it faded again.   After 10 minutes of sky watching, it had not returned, so I went inside. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellites, we suspect.  PD));43.2881;-70.8584

They look at first as if they are  still but when you  zoom up they are erratic with the direction they go.  Not like any normal  craft I have witnessed.  They move and stop just as fast.  The sky is usually clear and I see them just about every evening for the past few months.;43.2881;-70.8584
