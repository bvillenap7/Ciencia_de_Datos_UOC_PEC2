I looked in the sky to the right, I instantly said “what is that?” to my husband and pointed up at the three lights that were shaped in a triangle. It wasn’t moving or flying around, it was just floating there being really still, so I thought it was one of those metal tower things with the lights on top. But we go down this road a lot and it didn’t look familiar. I got a weird feeling and pulled off quick onto a side road then turned around. I wanted to go back down the road to see if it was still there and if I could get a better look at it. But we couldn’t see it anymore. I turned around again, the same way we were going in the first place. We looked in the same spot I first saw it, and it was gone. I was shocked. We continued to go home after that, and we did see something flying with lights kind of fast, but I’m not sure if it was a he! licopter or if it was what we saw. I’m still very creeped out by this because I knew that this thing wasn’t moving and that it didn’t look normal to me.;43.2881;-70.8584
