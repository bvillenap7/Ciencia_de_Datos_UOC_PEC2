Myself and a friend saw an orange a circle that made no noise whatsoever. At first I thought it was a helicopter until it came over my house so low and made no noise.  It then disappeared after watching it for roughly 30 seconds and trying to get a picture of it.  I looked online and saw other people have seen these as well.   I think it was moving to fast to be a candle bag thing and was to slow to be a helicopter or plane.;43.8128;-70.4852000000001
