While doing yard work with my neighbor, I heard a small aircraft passing overhead. Out of curiosity I looked up and saw the single engine plane. Then I noticed some extremely bright lights flashing just below some black storm clouds. I looked more closely and could make out a rectangular shape moving Southwest very slowly then just came to a stop. I called to my neighbor and asked her to look up and tell me what she saw. She said, “what is that?” We watched it for about ten minutes, just sitting there in one spot, not moving and very bright lights flashing from all three points of its shape. It then started moving slowly to the Northeast and went into the heavy black clouds.;43.8128;-70.4852000000001
