WE HAVE SEEN AIRCRAFT CRUISING BY AND SEEMED LOWER IN ALTITUDE THAN THIS THING AND ABOUT 1/4 ITS SPEED. THIS THING WAS COVERING SOME GROUND ON SOME MEGA SPEED. IT WAS HEADING NORTH INTO N.B. CANADA AND AFTER ABOUT 10 OR SO MINUTES IT HAD DISAPPEARED COMPLETELY. ME, MY WIFE AN R.N. AND 3 STEP SONS AS WELL AS 2 OF THEIR FRIENDS OBSERVED IN THE NIGHT SKY WITH NO MOON, THE FAST OBJECT.IT LOOKED LIKE A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT WITH NO APPARENT RED OR GREEN SIDE MARKERS LIKE AIRCRAFT DOES NOR WERE THEY LANDING LIGHTS LIKE THE ONE THAT LOOK LIKE HEAD LIGHTS. IT WAS SOME WHAT CLOUDY BUT MOSTLY CLEAR AND WE HAD A GOOD VIEW OF THE OBJECT. THE LIGHT WAS A BEATIFUL PURE WHITE WITH NO OTHER COLORS. IT LOOKED ROUND AND NOT OVAL. FAST AS ALL GET OUT. THANK-YOU ((NUFORC Note:  Our first guess might have been that the witnesses were observing the ISS, but if the object generated a contrail, that is not the proper explanation of the sighting.  We do not understand how an object can be moving at an alarming speed, but be visible for an estimated 10 minutes.  Those two aspects of the report seem to us potentially inconsistent.  We will attempt to contact the witness and inquire about this aspect of the sighting.  PD));46.6827999999999;-68.0169000000001
