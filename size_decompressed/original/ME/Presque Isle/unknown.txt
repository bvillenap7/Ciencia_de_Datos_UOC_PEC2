I’ve witnessed 4-6 objects in the sky a few times.  These objects have flashing lights that change color.  I’ve taken binoculars to observe these objects closer.  They remain rather close to each other.  They blink red, green, blue, purple and white in a very quick pattern and move back and fourth, up and down rather fast.  They will occasionally stay one color and sway back and fourth.  These objects remain in the sky for a few hours. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect twinkling stars.
