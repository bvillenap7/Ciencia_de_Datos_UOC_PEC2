Standing on porch looked up to see triangle shaped objects following one another.  they had an amber glow that was not bright by any mean and they seemed to be playing with one another.  one craft on the right seemed to maintain a steady course but would stop abruptly and continue at a high rate of speed.  the craft following was darting back and forth and would stop on a time mid air with the other craft.  the two crafts continued forward but in a staggering formation and eventually disappeared out of sight behind my neighbors building.  this was nothing i had ever seen before and the speed and abrupt direction changes as well as the hovering in one place then acceleration beyond anything I've seen gives me no doubt that these were not crafts that would be of a man made nature.  this was truly spectacular and I've never claimed to see a UFO my entire life and would not even consider myself a believer but this event was truly unexplained.;46.6827999999999;-68.0169000000001
