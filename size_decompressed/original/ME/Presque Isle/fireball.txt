Huge fireball emitting a white light that lit up the entire sky, falling at amazing speeds then dissapearing.;2008-01-28 00:00:00;2 Minutes Or Less;Huge fireball emitting a white light that lit up the entire sky, falling at amazing speeds then dissapearing. VERY Bright object bigger than the moon hovering in the sky for a few seconds before shooting towards the ground at an angle heading directly towards Presque Isle Maine, the object looked almost like a huge flare and it had two trails of fire burning  off the end of it, the object appearently dissapeared before it hit the ground. No calls were made to the police relating to this crash, so no other eyewitness reports could be found. The object did not appear to be a plane crash, it looked more like a strange falling object or a shooting star that had come WAY too close to earth, and possibly burned up while falling. I personally still beleive this could have been an Unidentified Flying Object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));46.6827999999999;-68.0169000000001
