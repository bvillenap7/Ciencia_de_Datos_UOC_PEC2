cigar shaped lights pass over Presque Isle and disappear over airport (when closed);1974-12-05 20:30:00;2 mins;cigar shaped lights pass over Presque Isle and disappear over airport (when closed) My best friend and I were out snowmobiling one evening crossing the airport over Hanson lakes dam and over the abandoned road leading to Creasy Ridge, finally stopping to look over the lights of Presque Isle.  After sitting on our sleds for about 15 to 20 mins we saw an dark cigar shape (almost saucer shaped) with lights on each end and towards the middle pass over the lights of town, moving over the trees and a mobile home then stopping to hover over the road we had arrived on.  The craft hovered or maybe turned like a tank turrent does, and then raced off following the road and disappeared over the airport, making no noise at the time.  The airport was closed down at the time. I could tell this because the runway lights are turned on by the Flight Service STation in Houlton when needed by radio.  This craft was also seen from our home neighborhood by my friends mother looking out her homes back door which faces the ridge, at about the right time.  My father was an Navigation Aid electronic tech stationed at Presque from 1960 to 1976 and I grew up on and around the airport and am now a lic. pilot.
