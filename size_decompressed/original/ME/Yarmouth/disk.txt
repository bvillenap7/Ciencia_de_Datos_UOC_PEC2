It looked to be in a saucer shape moving quickly.  I was in complete shock when I saw it that it didn’t even occur to me to try and take a video of it until it was too far away.  I pulled off on exit 17 to try and chase it but it faded into the fog heading toward the coast.  I don’t think I blinked the rest of my way home.  I was a skeptic but now I don’t know what to think.;43.7996;-70.1779
