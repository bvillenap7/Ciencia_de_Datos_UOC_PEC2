Driving home last night I saw a small spherical object similar to a star at first, but with some flashing lights on it which I thought was odd. As I got closer it became apparent that it was definately not an airplane or anything I've seen before, and it was falling slowly, apparently on-fire. So I immediate think it might be some sort of incredibly slow falling meteorite, but the flashing lights lead me to believe otherwise. Also, I waited and watched in the night as I continued driving past the vicinity where I believed it was falling to, and heard no explosions. The sky also did not light up to indicate some sort of fire or crash. I have no idea where it went. Alien or not, I dunno, but it was definately a UFO.;43.7996;-70.1779
