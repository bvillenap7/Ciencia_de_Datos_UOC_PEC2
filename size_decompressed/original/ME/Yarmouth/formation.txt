hundreds of tiny non-blinking lights, following in perfect line.  ((Starlink satellites?));2019-01-07 23:00:00;15 minutes;hundreds of tiny non-blinking lights, following in perfect line   It was a formation of tiny, pinprick-like lights very high up in the sky.  They looked like stars, but were moving in a perfectly straight line.  There were hundreds of them all following each other across the sky.  They were not blinking but were alight.  Imagine hundreds of small stars following each other in a perfect line.  I, my sister, and our two friends saw this on a beach at night.  The lights moved into our field of vision, across the sky, and out of it.;43.7996;-70.1779
