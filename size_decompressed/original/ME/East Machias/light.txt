Light in sky got brighter and truck almost stalled out light flickered out.;1998-08-05 21:00:00;1 minute;Light in sky got brighter and truck almost stalled out light flickered out. First I want to say I am not crazy,  Iam only posting this because I mentioned my sighting to a co worker who told me to post it. Iam a reserve deputy sheriff what I seen I can't explain.  I was travling out of East Machias on Rte 191 when I noticed  a light in the sky, that I thought at first was a star but it was getting brighter and brighter,  the light was bright white and it did not move,  as I drover closer in it's direction it would get brighter,  Then my truck started to act like it wanted to stall out.  I stoped the truck, when I stoped the truck the light flickered and got dimmer and dimmer till it flickered out.  I looked for any other lights like a marker light or a strobe but I could not see a thing.  I tried my police raido and it was not working, till I arived home.    I am worried about people thinking I'm nuts but I'm not This event scared me.;44.7424000000001;-67.3820999999999
Flare Lights;1999-09-18 09:15:00;7 min;Flare Lights At first glance I thought I was looking at two starlightflares side by side, they were motionless then started to desend downward picking up speed,then slowing down and coming to a complete stop.Then slowly started to move parallel at a forty five degree angle,picking up speed then again slowing down to a complete stop.Remained motionless for a few seconds,then started to desend again picking up speed,then slowing down and coming to a complete stop for a few seconds.It appeared to me to be making a stairstepping motion,every thing was at a forty five degree angle. My wife and I watch this for about seven minutes as it continued this movement. I thought to my self that it may be landing ,but it seemed to not be getting any closer to the ground, So to me it seemed that it must be very high and very large. All we could see was two flare like lanterns side by side.we couldnt see a craft, just  two lights, that to me could have been engine outlets.Was this craft having some kind of trouble? I dont know. We didnt get to excited about it ,it just seemed strange.I served in the military for many years and and I never saw a aircraft make a perfect fortyfive degree angle turn. Also there was no sound.;44.7424000000001;-67.3820999999999
Flashing lights that approached each other and flew in a circle in Maine.;2008-08-31 01:00:00;5 minutes;Flashing lights that approached each other and flew in a circle in Maine. At approximately 1:00 AM on August the 31st, 2008, a friend and I were watching the night sky and the shooting stars on Rocky Lake, which is in far eastern Maine.  I noticed a flashing light up about 20 degrees in the sky to the left of the big dipper.  Then to the right we noticed another flashing light coming towards and under the big dipper.  The two flashing lights that were approaching each other became brighter as they got closer to each other.  When they got to about 4 inches apart, as I saw them in the sky, they stopped (or dramatically slowed), became really bright, and began to do flash about randomly in a circle for about 5 seconds, in the space between where they stopped at and became bright at and each other.  After that, two lights traveled from that point roughly back the same way as they came. As I saw the lights they were similar to the newer flashing lights of police cars that appear to randomly flash different colors yet there is a pattern if you look closer.  I saw the lights as being connected, but flashing at separate places on the object. I did not have my camera on me and did not want to go back to my tent to get it at this point.  After a few seconds we talked about what we had just seen.  I was cold and went to the tent for my camera, binoculars and more clothing.  When I got back I sat and watched the stars with my friend who was still there until it got too cold so I went back to my tent to sleep.;44.7424000000001;-67.3820999999999
