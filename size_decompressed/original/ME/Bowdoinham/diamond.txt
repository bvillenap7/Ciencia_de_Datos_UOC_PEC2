I noticed a strange out of ordinary craft up in the sky out in the distance.   I then noticed, as we were headed towards it, that it was not moving no where but very still and I'd put it at around 1200 feet with 7 lights about a quarter the size of the moon and very frightening.   I felt as if it knew I was watching it.  The craft showed no intention to hide itself and it was creepy.   It was blinking lights but not of any plane or air craft I have ever seen it was I would say between 60 to 80 feet long and 25 to 50 feet wide.  It had a yellow light a white light and a few blue.   It's raining bad so it is hard telling the shape and distance as well as it being night time.  It was diamond/triangle shaped.
