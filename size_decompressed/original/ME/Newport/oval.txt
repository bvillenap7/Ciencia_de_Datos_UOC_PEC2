Strange U.F.O. space craft spotted over Newport Maine.;2009-01-27 23:30:00;5 minutes;Strange U.F.O. space craft spotted over Newport Maine. Tuesday January 27th 2009 at 11:30 pm, In Newport Maine, I happened to look out my kitchen window and see a very large distinct U.F.O. space craft up in the sky. It appeared to be hovering above somewhere over the town of Hermon Maine. It was initially slowly making it's way left towards Bangor then it stopped in mid air and hovered for about 30 seconds, it then moved back towards the right and stopped and hovered again, it hovered for about 2 minutes and then slowly started hovering straight down until it dissapeared out of sight due to the tree line. It had distinct white and red flashing lights that didn't match up to any plane or helicopter that I've seen at night before. It also didn't have any audible sound in the sky like a plane would. It also seemed quite low in the sky as well as moved any direction it pleased. My grandfather also witnessed it right along side of me. A gentlemen who works with my grandfather said his wife (and her female passenger in her car) saw the same U.F.O. earlier that night at around 9:30 pm on her way home from the bangor/hermon area. She said that she stopped on a hill heading home to watch the U.F.O. and she said that it looked pretty nearby to her. She said it just hovered for a while and then dissapeared out of sight. I could clearly tell from my observations that night, that this was some type of unexplainable U.F.O. space craft.;44.841;-69.2721000000001
