Has distinct cigar, almost saucer shape outline, not shape like a usual airplane.  It was above tree line, but too far away to see detail.  I normally would not report this, but it had unusual shape.  It was white color and straight, not tilted.  It was moving slowly but lost sight as it moved away.  It may have been a manmade object of some sort but no binoculars to get a closer view.  Anyways, the unusual design of the object is the reason I reported it.
