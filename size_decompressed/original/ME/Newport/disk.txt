Silver saucer with white flashing lights flew overhead;1997-06-10 12:00:00;5 mins.;Silver saucer with white flashing lights flew overhead I was 13 years old, in seventh grade, and I was at lunch with a fellow student and my teacher.  (My teacher took us out to lunch at a local restaurant for good behavior over the course of the school year.)  We sat in a booth, and I faced the window with my fellow classmate.  During the conversation I kept seeing a bright light in the distant sky outside.  I assumed it was the metal from an airplane reflecting the sunlight.  I kept looking out the window because the light drew closer.  I soon noticed the light was flashing, and I thought that it could be sunlight glinting off of a helicopter instead.  My curiousity remained, so I continued to watch it as the flashing light came closer and closer.  Soon enough it actually flew over the restaurant, and I was dumbfounded and in disbelief at what I saw.  It was a rather large, silvery metal saucer, and the flashing [white] lights were on the outer rim of the saucer.  They seemed to be flashing because the lights would turn on and off in a line, going round and round the rim.  Looking back, I suppose the lights could have seemed to be going round and round if the saucer were spinning, but at the time that did not seem to be the case.  Either way, I could not believe what I had seen.  I asked my friend sitting next to me if she had seen it, and she said she had not seen it.  I think they both thought I was crazy, but even to this day I cannot shake the image from my brain.  I know what I saw and I believe in my experience 100%.

Sighted a disk/saucer shaped craft with rotating lights at 4:30 heading to Newport.;2016-12-09 16:30:00;10 minutes;Sighted a disk/saucer shaped craft with rotating lights at 4:30 heading to Newport. My mother and I were traveling in a car towards Newport at 4:30 PM, when a moving light caught my notice.  My mother was only able to take a short look at the object as she was driving the car at the time.  I watched it for ten minutes, searching over possible explanations for the strange object.  It lacked the consistent blinking and red and green light color common to planes.   The altitude at which the object maneuvered, I would estimate, was like that of a plane (39,000 feet), possibly lower.  The object moved fairly quickly and was lit by white/yellow light which appeared to rotate.   I lost sight of the object when it moved behind a large cloud and apparently disappeared.;44.841;-69.2721000000001
