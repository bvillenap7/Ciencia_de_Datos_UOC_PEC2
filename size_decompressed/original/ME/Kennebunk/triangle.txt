Is this a UFO or the government;2020-09-27 00:00:00;30 minutes;Is this a UFO or the government I was having a hard night with sleeping so I went outside in my yard an walked around. I noticed it getting brighter so it mad me look up at the moon. When I looked up it was bright like super bright an it wasn’t a full moon night An for a mint I thought the moon was moving.it looked like it was getting close an backing up a few times I thought I saw this. So I continued to look up at it an follow it in the sky. I watched an watched an became really interested with it I felt that this thing was unusual. So I pulled out my phone and started to take a video. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It was bright big had about 3 or so sides it looked maybe it looked like it was also turning an at one point well it started lighting up one one side than another an another. One of the times it was light up I saw a vehicle go by me on the road an well I thought I saw it flash almost like Something took a picture like a flash of light. A day later I sat here an played ! that video wondering if I had indeed seen what I thought I had. Just put it this way when I got to the video we’re the Vehicle was driving by I DID INDEED caught an unbelievable thing I slow mode the time in my video an that thing in the sky well it flashed a light right down on that vehicle an a ray of a green light.
