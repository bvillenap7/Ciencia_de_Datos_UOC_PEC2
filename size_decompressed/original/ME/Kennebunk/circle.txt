((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 2055 hrs (EDT).  PD))   a bright moving star;2005-04-29 21:00:00;3 minutes;a bright moving star My friends and I where riding our bikes when we saw a very bringht star that was moving in an odd pattern and was not blinking like any sort of plane. We are positive that this was a  space craft of some sort. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 2055 hrs (EDT).  We believe the missile may have been launched to the northeast from Cape Canaveral, which explains why people reported the launch from locations as far north as Maine.  PD));43.3858;-70.5453
Orange light rising and disappearing again and again over ocean near Pease AFB;2020-02-08 02:00:00;Ongoing;Orange light rising and disappearing again and again over ocean near Pease AFB My bedroom is on the second floor and has a view that’s a wide opening to the sky and faces east about 3 miles fromthe ocean.  Nightly at around 9 pm I see orange lights fly slowly in the east along the shore.  Tonight my dog woke me up at around 2:30 am and I have been watching a very bright orange light rise up from the tree tops, linger about a minute and then just disappear.  This process lasts about 30 seconds and happens almost every minute or so and I have been up watching for an hour so far.  Pease AFB is nearby and I suspect they are training the fueling helicopters and wonder why they only train in the dead of night. I hope they aren’t dumping fuel as they train and don’t want people to see.  I see them out over the ocean most nights flying south to north in early the night but this is the first time this orange light is rising up into the sky and then disappearing again and again.  It is not going very high in the sky, but it rises up just over the tree! tops.  It is very bright orange.;43.3858;-70.5453
