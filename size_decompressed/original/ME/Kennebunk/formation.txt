Trio of 'craft' in formation, dots of lights.;2001-08-24 21:30:00;2 minutes;Trio of 'craft' in formation, dots of lights. While at the Astronomical Society of Northern New England's opening of their Starfield observatory in Kennebunk, Maine, we were observing an Iridium Flare.  At 21:29. One of our members observed a trio of 'satellites' moving in formation from East to Wesst at 80 degrees alt. ENE, in the constellation Lyra.  We put several bino's and one scope on the trio (we could only get one craft at a time) and they were only dots of lights with no characteristics of commercial aircraft. There were no noises as the craft were extremely high if not in orbit. The trio of craft continued in perfect formation westward until out of sight over the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Very few satellites fly to the west.  Observers seem to be quite qualified.  PD));43.3858;-70.5453
