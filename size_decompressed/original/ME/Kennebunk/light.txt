2 bright orange irregular lights moving slowly, with no sound, into a fog bank over the ocean.;2011-12-31 23:40:00;3 Minutes;2 bright orange irregular lights moving slowly, with no sound, into a fog bank over the ocean. I walked out of my house, through the basement door, facing East-South-East. I looked up towards the East and saw 2 lights at about 30 degrees above the horizon. The lights were orange in color and brighter than aircraft landing lights. They were moving in tandem, with slight variations in proximity to each other, generally maintaining about 10 degrees of arch between them, from my perspective. I could not tell their size, how far away from me they were or their altitude, with no frame of reference. They were moving slowly from the north. They were moving faster than would be expected had they been wind driven, as it was a windless night. I followed them visually until they approached the apex of a neighboring house. I walked to the North end of the parking lot, in order to maintain visual contact. I watched them continue at the same previously described speed. They gradually arched upward and towards the Southwest, then faded into a fog bank that I presume ! was over the ocean. The objects made no sound. There was no discernible outline of a physical aircraft that I could see. The lights weren't perfectly round and even in tone, but more of a diamond shape.;43.3858;-70.5453
Multiple lights following each other   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-14 02:30:00;20 minutes;Multiple lights following each other Stepped out of house for last cigarette before bed. Looking west to a very clear sky. I noticed what I thought may have been a satellite. As always I track to see if it moves. As I was tracking I noticed another not far behind then another then another. After the third one I ran to the door and yelled for my girlfriend to come see. We counted 12 total. None following directly behind in a straight line. And not evenly spaced out. No blinking lights and nothing on flighttrader24. No moon. Reason I thought this was odd was looking west, the sun had set and the objects were illuminated (white) on the eastern side. No noise either. Sighting was around 35 degrees up from horizon.;43.3858;-70.5453
