Bright Strobe Lights Over Rockland Maine;2014-03-29 02:00:00;>1 hour;Bright Strobe Lights Over Rockland, Maine. This was a flashing object in the sky.  The flashes were bright and blue/white light.   The light pattern was irregular but there did appear to be strobes in an irregular fashion.  The light being emitted appeared to stay in one spot the entire time.   We thought it might be on a cell tower on the mountain but it was above the mountain in the sky.  It almost appeared like this was just above a cloud and was hidden due to the cloud that didn't move.   It was there over one hour.   We did see two other vehicles heading in the direction as well - we weren't the only ones who saw it.;44.1123;-69.1154
