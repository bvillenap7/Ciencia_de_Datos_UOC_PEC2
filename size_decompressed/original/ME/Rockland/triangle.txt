Large Triangle spotted over Mooshead Lake ME;2004-09-14 22:30:00;6 mins;Large Triangle spotted over Mooshead Lake ME We were on on the dock at the Birches Resort on Moosehead Lake, stargazing with a group of 4 other guests for about an hour. The sky was crystal clear, with no cloud cover and the moon was not visible which made viewing the stars ideal. At around 10:30 PM EST, a very large triangular shaped object began to move very slowly above us, we estimate around 10,000 feet, but it was hard to tell, due to it's size and there was absolutely no sound coming from the craft. The object traveled over Moosehead Lake and as it shrunk from view just across the lake, it began to climb straight up, then it began to reverse direction in an arc like motion and head back in the opposite direction across the lake. There were 3 very large, glowing gold lights on the object that were stationary and no other lights or blinking lights were noticed. The object disappeared out of viewing range once it crossed the lake. This was the most unusual and large flying object any of us had ever witnessed. One of the witnesses flys helicopters and planes and is an expert in aviation and even he remarked that he'd never seen anything like it and could not even guess what it might have been.
