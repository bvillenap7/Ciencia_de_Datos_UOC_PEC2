Balls of light that are not airplanes don't move like these things;2015-10-05 01:35:00;30 minutes+;Balls of light that are not airplanes don't move like these things I was closing my window when I saw a white light with a flashing red light.  At first i thought it was a plane but a plane passed by it and then started to show a bluish green light while moving side to side effortlessly.  I went outside to get a better look and noticed 6 other, much smaller, balls of light moving.  I thought they were stars but stars don't move nor do they get brighter or dimmer like these did. 	After 30 minutes,  several of the smaller balls of light disappeared.  One is still going side to side and the first one I noticed seems to be staying close by it.  I don't know if I was seeing this right, but, I thought it looked like some of the balls of light were shooting at each other.  I only say this because I saw faint white streaks coming from a few of these lights and other lights would move in a different direction as though they were dodging them.;43.4937;-70.4913999999999
