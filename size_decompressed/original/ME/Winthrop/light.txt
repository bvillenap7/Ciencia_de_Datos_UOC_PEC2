Bright cigar shaped light in Winthrop, ME.;2012-08-07 21:10:00;2 minutes;bright cigar shaped light in Winthrop, ME My friend and I had stepped outside for a cigarette and saw an extremely bright cigar shaped light. The object was moving quickly and had no other light color besides the intense white light it was generating. It was very quiet and there were absolutely no engine noises as you would expect from the highth of the object.  We stood and listened for several minutes after it went out of sight and still no noise. It was moving from east to west, it was clear skys, and only was obstructed by view when it moved out of sight over the trees continuing its course... very cool...;44.3229;-69.9576
Silent white light.;2021-07-28 10:41:00;10 seconds;Silent white light. I witnessed a single bright white/blue (like an arc welder) light traveling in a south easterly direction. Approximately 1500 feet high moving about 200mph. It was silent. No blinking lights. Not a plane, not a helicopter and not a meteor. I had a bright flash light in hand as I was outside to observe an expected meteor shower. I recognized it was something unusual right away. I decided to blink my flash light at it, to see if it would respond. I blinked my light twice. The light immediately changed course. Now traveling straight up from my view point. It disappeared into space. The sky was extremely clear and made this all a stunning experience. It happened quickly.;44.3229;-69.9576
