Never seen anything like this.  My girlfriend was back to and got startled when I yelled Wow i just saw something.  She thought i saw shooting star.   I know what a shooting star looks like.  This was not that this object was way low in atmosphere.  So low it was moving fast and close to rooftops.  My best description is when I saw it I immediately had a feeling that this is something special, it was an extremely bright white in color bright but a flat white color, round but not perfectly round.  I could feel it was a ufo.  I waited longer with her and nothing.  I was hoping someone else may have saw the same white object but have not heard anything yet.;43.4702;-70.8012
