A row of horizontal yellow/orange lights hovering over the Saco River;2012-07-28 21:15:00;3-5 minutes;A row of horizontal yellow/orange lights hovering over the Saco River My husband and I were driving home from a wedding and were crossing over the bridge at the bottom of Cornish station hill, I was driving and as we crossed over the bridge I saw the row of lights hovering over the water of the Saco River and the lights were just at the tree top level, this would be on my left side, the lights were a soft yellow/orange color, there were at least 5 lights in a row, as we corssed the bridge I said to my husband what I thought I saw, I then turned our car around and drove back accross the bridge for another look now the lights were on the right side and still there, we went slowly accross the bridge watching the lights then again turned around heading back in our originial direction and the lights were still there now on our left side again. So we decided to go up the road to the next street to try and see if we could get a closer look. We drove up Rt 25 and went down a side road and did not see anything then decided to go back o! ver the bridge for another look, when we went back over the bridge the lights were gone. We have been over this bridge many times and there are no structures in the area, just trees and the river.;43.7775;-70.7757
