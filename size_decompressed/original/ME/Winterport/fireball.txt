She was gone for about 20 minutes, I decided to go check on her to make sure she was alright. I then stepped outside and looked up at the night sky. I noticed a bright light about the size of a plane but a little bigger. I though it was weird there were no lights on it flashing to distinguish it was a plane. My first reaction was that it was a satellite or a space shuttle since they are repairing the Hubble Telescope.  I rushed to the garage to get my mom to try and show what I was seeing. I was keeping an eye on the object the whole time as to not lose it. I then noticed that it started to go from side across the sky like a plane would, then it started to go straight up and stay in a spot in the sky and started to flash. Two other points in the sky that were to the lower left of it started to flash and move side to side. The main light was in the same spot but moved up and down and kept flashing.  We both went back into the garage and started to sort some things out and move things around. About 5 minutes elapsed and we went back out and to my surprise they were still there in the sky flashing and moving a little bit, and then they all vanished one after another. All 3 lights disappeared. Keep in mind that planes are flying around in the sky due to the fact I live a few towns away from a major airport.  They moved way to fast for a plane and too slow to be a satellite or a space shuttle. I have seen the space shuttle in the sky while in orbit and that moved very fast. I do not know what it was that I saw, the only conclusion I can come to is a UFO.;44.6552;-68.8862
