Red and green craft drops from clouds;2019-10-14 19:30:00;60 seconds;Red and green craft drops from clouds A red and orange oval craft dropped from the clouds to about 50 feet above the trees on the Bangor Waterfront. The craft hovered, then descended into the trees. It remained hidden until it reappeared above the trees again. Dogs began barking at it. It dipped into the trees again. I never saw it re-emerge from the trees. It was a red oval with two green circular lights on the front almost like headlights. The craft was the size of a dime held at arms length.;44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
