After getting off the phone, I went outside to look for it. I found it, and after squinting it almost looked like some sort of electronic signals almost in the shape of an airplane with lights that are red, blue and green with one central light. It is the strangest thing I have ever seen. It is stationary and is not moving through the sky, so far it has been in the sky for 45 minutes ((NUFORC Note:  Reports seems to us to be not inconsistent with a twinkling star.  We will invite the witness to confirm the sighting against a star chart.  PD));44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
