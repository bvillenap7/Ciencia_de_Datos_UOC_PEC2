Chevron object seen in night sky.;2014-12-18 21:30:00;20 seconds;Chevron object seen in night sky. I was driving home from Bangor, Maine, at approximately 9:30 p.m.  I was on Outer Ohio Street headed West – Northwest.  It was still somewhat cloudy from the snow that came through earlier that day.   Because I am always looking at the night sky out of habit and fascination I looked up out of the upper driver’s side of my truck’s  window and saw what appeared to be the same type of object that was previously reported at a earlier time this same evening of Dec. 18, 2014, in Pennsylvania.  It was the same as stated in that report:  A very large object in the shape that migrating geese fly and the so called bottom of it had many equally spaced lights on it.  For the little time I was able to get a fairly decent view, the lights appeared to be all white, but pretty large.  Just as I was about to pull over to get a better view it appeared to ascend slowly into the clouds with an eerie type glow in the surrounding clouds.  Then it was history.   This was also fairly near to an airport but with a few farms and many wide open totally dark farmlands surrounding the area. I have only lived in Maine 2.5 years, but have seen all sorts of weird objects in the night skies year round.  I have been reluctant to report until now.  I thought I would come home and get on the computer and see if anyone else might have seen the same thing.  BINGO! someone did in a different state just a couple of hours earlier.;44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
