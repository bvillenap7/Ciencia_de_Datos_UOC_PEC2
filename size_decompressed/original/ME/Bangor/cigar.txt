two bright white lights(front and back), no noise, moving slow, low to ground, near airbase/airport;2002-07-12 23:15:00;1 minute;two bright white lights(front and back), no noise, moving slow, low to ground, near airbase/airport slow-moving and low to the ground, the object was oblong with bright white lights in the front and back.  two small red, blinking lights on the bottom with another small non-blinking white light in the center of the bottom.  the object made no noise, if had i would have heard it since it wasn't that far way. i live near an airport/airbase, so this could have been a plane?  this thing couldn't have been a plane nor a helicopter. a week and a half before seeing this thing, i was hearing strange noises coming from the airbase.  the best way to describe the noise that i was hearing is to say that it sounded like a ufo from some cheesey 60's ufo film.  i heard these noises for about 2 weeks and only late at night/early morning.  after hearing what i heard, and seeing what i saw... something strange is going down at the airbase.;44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
