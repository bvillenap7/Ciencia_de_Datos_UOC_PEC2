I noticed an unusually bright looking one.  It had bright green and red alternating hues to it.  And white light.  But it was about four times larger than any other star in the sky.  Even the North star. I am a high school student from a smaller city, not completely rural. I get great grades, and I am very normal, whatever that means. The Unidentified Flying 0bject (-I want to specify that it was unidentified, that means that I'm not calling it a flying saucer,) appeared to be a little closer than a star, but far enough away to look light a star at first glance. It looked four times larger than an actual star, and it was twice as bright. It has three colors to it.  Mostly white with red and green flashing on it alternately.  I watched it for about a half an hour while riding in a car. I gave up after a while.;44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
A bright light hovering in the sky, closes into itself, then takes off at an incredible speed.;1999-06-06 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;A bright light hovering in the sky, closes into itself, then takes off at an incredible speed. I live in an area less than a mile from the old Dow Air Force Base, the site now houses Bangor International Airport. It was at night, in a little patch of woods known as Brown Woods Trail. My boyfriend and myself were in the woods, no flashlights, just darkness, when we came to a clearing. Coming over the treetops and moving towards us was a bright light. We thought it must be a helicopter as we are less than a mile from the airport. The light just hovered there, making no noise what so ever. As soon as I pointed at it and mentioned it being there, the light seemed to close into itself until it was just a pinpoint of light and then took off straight up at an incredible speed. I don't believe we have the kind of technology it would require to travel at such speeds.  Two months previously, in the same general area I experienced the exact same thing.

Pilot and passenger witness light to the northeast of their aircraft, which they could not identify.;2006-09-20 19:30:00;5 minutes;Telephoned Report: Pilot and passenger witness light to the northeast of their aircraft, which they could not identify. Telephoned Report:  A young pilot, enroute to Bangor, reported that he and his passenger witnessed a peculiar light directly ahead of their aircraft, which they could not identify.  He emphasized that the light was almost certainly not the landing light on another approaching aircraft, and that he could not see red or green navigation lights on the object.  When asked whether he had contacted Approach Control, to have them attempt to identify the object, he said that he had not.  The light suddenly just disappeared, as both witnesses were staring at it from their cockpit.;44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
Small star-like white light seen 3 separate times, seach time changing direction, travelling straight, and ascending until out of view.;2009-09-05 21:15:00;25 minutes;Small star-like white light seen 3 separate times, seach time changing direction, travelling straight, and ascending until out of view. I was outside having a smoke staring at the sky when I suddenly noticed a small moving point of light up in the sky that would have looked like a star had it been stationary. It moved through the sky in a pretty straight path though it did deviate from it's path slight at times. Twice, it quickly skipped forward at 45 degree angles. I will say that I saw the light three separate times so I have no way of knowing if it was the same light three times or individual lights. There were a two separate airplanes in the sky during my sighting which gave a good point of reference. The planes had flashing lights and were much closer as the lights were much larger than the tiny points of moving lights that I saw. While the planes were clearly much closer, the light moved across the sky several times faster than the planes. The first time I saw the light it was flying to the North through the sky and as it flew over my house, it slowed gradually as the light grew smaller until I could no longer see it. It gave the impression that it quickly angled upwards to an altitude at which the light could no longer be seen but I can't be sure. I stayed, watching the sky, and 10 minutes later it reappeared in much the same way that it had disappeared, horizontally, further to the right going the opposite direction it had been going initially. It traveled across the sky going to the South in the same way as before and disappeared again exactly as it had the first time. 5 minutes later, it reappeared the same way a third time further to the North, having changed directions to the North yet again. It traveled and disappeared in the same way again. I waited for 10 more minutes to see if it would return and I did not see it again. Each of the three sightings lasted approximately 15-25 seconds. I did see a small meteor though which was CLEARLY different it was very bright and only visible for a fraction of a second.;44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
Single light slowly moves across the horizon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of ISS??  PD));2012-08-13 20:45:00;2 minutes;Single light slowly moves across the horizon. A single light passed a group of 5 adults tonight around 8:45 pm. Moved from west to east.  Was the size of a bb gun bb no strob, no sound.  Not sure how high as it was night.  Blinked off & on erratically, like going from the size of a bb to the size of all the other stars.  Disappeared over the horizon.  Object took 2-3 minutes to go from 40 degrees above my head over the horizon. Was not a plane, helicopter, or any Other flying object I've witnessed living in close proximity to a large airport.;44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
Three blinking lights in nightsky of Bangor, Maine, helicopters searching the area.;2012-09-17 20:30:00;one hour;Three blinking lights in nightsky of Bangor, Maine, helicopters searching the area. I was in my room and heard what sounded like a helicopter hovering above. This was around 8:30 pm. At first, I just simply ignored the sound.  But after five minutes, I decided to go outside. The sound was indeed that of a helicopter. However, as I looked up into the sky, I saw three lights blinking. The lights must have been about a few miles up in the sky, and equidistant apart (am not sure about the actual distance between each of the lights).  Then, another helicopter arrived, circling the area above. As I am typing now, I can still hear the sound of at least one helicopter. They are definitely investigating the blinking lights, which I no longer see. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Two oval lights appear, hover, and move off to the East;2013-03-26 05:15:00;1 minute;Two oval lights appear, hover, and move off to the East At 5 am I was setting on the edge of my bed looking out my window to th northwest.  Earlier I was admiring the huge bright moon while it slipped below the tree line.  As I was taking a pill I looked up and saw 2 lights, shaped oval, hovering over an old Bomarc missile base about a mile or so to the Northwest, just appear out of the darkness. They just hovered there for about a minute not changing color or shape.  I awoke my wife to see these lights, and just as she moved to see out the window they started moving to the East.  They made no noise and the clear white light just kind of flickered slightly.  They moved off to the east from the point I first saw them.  Now I am a pilot with over 1200 hours in my log book and, who's father was a navigation tech. With both the USAF and with the Federal Aviation Admin.  I grew up around Loring AFB and the Presque Isle airport (along with many nav sights in northern Maine).  My point here is these lights were between me and the Bangor VOR, which sits a few miles off the north end of Bangor International Airport. There were no strobe or anti collision  lights, no wing position lights, a red light should have been visible as they were approaching me and the left wing would have a red light marking it.   As i said earlier, there was no sound at any time.  The lights were about 2 to 3 football fields apart from the time the appeared until they moved out of my sight.  I see aircraft flying over and around home most every day.  BIA is the home of the 101st air refueling wing, flying KC 135 Stratotankers, which make a huge noise on take off and cruising overhead.   Also we have a helicopter unit stationed here, flying UH 60 Blackhawks, which are also noisy.  The lights approached no closer than  2 football fields near me.  I saw no other lights or aircraft in the sky.;44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
A flying, bright object was flying at a fast pace then slowed down and dimmed as it came to Earth.;2013-06-17 22:30:00;1 minute;A flying, bright object was flying at a fast pace then slowed down and dimmed as it came to Earth. We were outside and saw a bright object flying at a fast pace.  It slowed down and got closer to Earth.  I was video taping it and it out shinned the stars.  My Ipod had full battery and shut off when I was taping.  When I checked it it was not saved and the battery was restored.  The object got dimmer as it came down slowly.  There was only one object to our knowledge.  The object was bigger and brighter than a star. It was a bright white color.;44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
Two dimmer, low-flying lights flying one in front of the other  at same speed on a northeast path.;2015-05-05 21:26:00;<2 minutes;Two dimmer, low-flying lights flying one in front of the other  at same speed on a northeast path. My roommate and I were on the rooftop deck of our apartment in downtown Bangor.  There's a white bat that lives in the area, and we noticed it flying overhead.  The bat was flying somewhere above the vicinity of Main Street & Cross Street.  We were watching the bat, when I noticed what I thought to be a single craft with two dim, semi-hazy lights located on the front and back.  (No craft was actually visible, just the two lights. If this was a craft, it would be cigar-shaped.)  My roommate whispered, Oh my god...do you see that? The lights flew above the bat but below the cloud cover, and were moving at a faster pace than the bat.  They moved at the same speed, without sound.   Instantly, the lights jumped forward and to the side, changing direction slightly from a northeast-path to a more northerly path. (Based on iPhone compass app, original path was about 60 degrees, and changed to 35 degrees.)  The jump forward in distance was roughly the same length as the distance between the two lights (or, if it was a single craft, the length of the draft, itself.)  After the jump, the two lights kind of vibrated, like if it was one craft, it was wiggling ever so slightly and rather quickly. After the jump, the bat immediately did a 180 and booked it to a nearby church steeple. This was flying too low to be some kind of satellite or meteor, and there was absolutely no sound, so definitely not a helicopter or plane.  (Also, we live right by the airport, and, not only was this thing flying off the regular flight paths, but also, we're pretty familiar with every type of aircraft that lands or takes off around here.  Can't think of any possible explanation.;44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
