Three or four very large bright white tubular lights that were packed together and pulsating in unison.;2015-03-24 23:15:00;1 minute;Three or four very large bright white tubular lights that were packed together and pulsating in unison. I was traveling on Interstate 95 in the southbound lane between exits 191 and 187, when I saw to my right, maybe one hundred feet above the tall trees, a group or cluster of three or four very large bright white tubular lights that were packed together (pointy end toward me) and pulsating in unison at a rate that I estimated to be twice per second.   As we approached each other I stared intensely to see if I could make out the aerial vehicle that these lights were attached to, unfortunately I was unable to identify anything but the lights.  My cruise control was set on seventy and the light cluster appeared to be traveling toward me at a reasonable speed.   When we passed each other I looked in my truck’s side view mirror and was able to detect the object some distance behind me, still pulsating.  It is difficult now to say whether the object was traveling in my direction or was stationary.  This incident occurred not far from Bangor International Airport (BIA), which is adjacent to a National Guard airbase (Home of the Maniacs).  The object made no discernable noise, like a military aircraft does, and was clearly too close to the trees.   I’ve lived in this area for thirty-one years and have never once encountered such a thing.;44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
Large craft, many flashing red lights.;2020-08-22 01:30:00;2.5 minutes;Large craft, many flashing red lights. I saw large red flashing lights in the sky heading away from me at a slow rate of speed.I pulled my tuck over and watched it slowly go away from me with a slight turn to the left. Whatever it was it was large  Much bigger than I would expect from a plane and the flashing red lights were large also.  I could not tell the shape as it was going straight away from me but there was a row of flashing red lights with at least 1 that seemed more out front.  I would like to know if anything like this has been reported.;44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
