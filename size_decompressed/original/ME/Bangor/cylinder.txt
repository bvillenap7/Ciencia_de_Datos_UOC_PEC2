Most contrails from high flying jets go in a north to south direction but this caught my eye as it was traveling in a south to north direction, very high, over 30 thousand feet. It had no observable wings or tail and looked like a cylinder with slightly rounded ends. It was pale white and seemed translucent like a cloud. It had two, very faint, contrails that were very close together at the rear where the tail would have been. It may have been such a small plane that the wings and tail did not show, like a fighter but is something that I have never seem before. It flew in a straight line quite slowly compared to a normal airliner but didn't dart about or vary its trajectory, Maybe a plane but if it was it looked like Wonder Womans Translucent plane from my childhood comics;44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
