Circular structure in sky, blue and green light.  Vanished in thin air.;2016-07-22 00:20:00;2 minutes;Circular structure in sky, blue and green light.  Vanished in thin air. Saw a circular structure in the sky about th size of the tip of a pencil in distance.  Blue and green lights flashing.   Longhaul trucker from Canada driving south on the I-95.  It never moved, when I looked down at my phone and back up, it was gone.  It seemed to be suspended in the sky.   Too bright for a tower, too low for a plane. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) My apologies. 00:20 is correct.  ((END ADDENDUM));44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
