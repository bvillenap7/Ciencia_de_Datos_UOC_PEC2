I was driving and came in to this area where I heard an engine mechanical sound, (not a helicopter or plane) I did not see it until I pasted some trees, to the right in the air still in a distance away an odd shape craft in the air just above the trees, really questioned what I saw a brightly light diamond shape saw some tracks on the inside and reddish color, as I watched it closed to a triangle, travelled in my direction and flew past in front of me, this object have three blinking lights one in front two on each side the bulbs were cylinder shaped, there was a flat red light on the back, watched it go slowing into the clouds, I could see the red glowing from red as it was in the clouds.   (For the life of me no idea why I did not attempt to get a picture   I so regret this);44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
