RED, YELLOW, AND BLUE LIGHTS OVER BANGOR, MAINE.;2005-11-22 19:45:00;15 MINUTES;RED, YELLOW, AND BLUE LIGHTS OVER BANGOR, MAINE. I was on a vacation I was in Bangor, Maine I ate at an ITALIAN RESTAURANT called EVO ITALIAN BRICKOVEN. When I got there I saw 3 circle UFOS. They had on the inside of the bottom red, yellow, and blue lights. Then I saw 3 triangler UFOS. One was red lighted with yellow dots on the corner, the other one was yellow lighted with blue dots on the corners, the other one was blue lighted with red dots on the corner. This happened on November 22, 2005 on a Tuesday night at 7:45 P.M. I watched these objects these UFOS hovered over the restaurant I was eating at. I kept seeing these UFOS and I walked around the restaurant and I still saw them then I lost sight of these objects and didn't see them no more. Then I went inside the restaurant to eat dinner after I ate dinner I came out of the restaurant and didn't see them no more. They didn't make a sound It was partly cloudy that night in Bangor, Maine. I got back in my car and went back to my motel. I was puzzled to see the UFOS that I saw outside where I ate at.;44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
Stubby boomerang shaped object with no lights, tan/orange in color.;2012-07-09 23:00:00;20-60 seconds;Stubby boomerang shaped object with no lights, tan/orange in color. The sighting took place in the center of downtown Bangor Maine.  The skies were clear. I observed 4-5 (what I assumed to be) civilian aircrafts before the sighting, and 1 helicopter some time after the sighting.  I was on top of an apartment building stargazing when I noticed the object out of the corner of my eye. The object was fast moving and tannish-orange in color.  I observed no lights on the object in the short time I had a good view of it.  It's shape could be compared to a stubby boomerang with short wings. It wasn't following the flight path of any of the previously viewed aircrafts.  It was difficult to tell the height at which it was flying, but it was flying at a near immaculate pace.  I observed the object until it disappeared into the night sky, which leads me to believe the object could have possibly been reflecting the color/light from the city glow. Additional observation: the object, while it had no visible light emitting portions, appeared to have translucent gem-like fixings.  But I diddnt get a good enough look to say for sure.;44.8216161981262;-68.798627443106
