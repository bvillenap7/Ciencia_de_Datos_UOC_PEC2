Low flying  bright object appeared to zigzag  and hover.;2007-10-02 21:30:00;15 seconds;Low flying  bright object appeared to zigzag  and hover. Appeared as a shooting star, but going about 30 to 40% of the speed  and did not leave a trail.  It came from the west, and was flying low to the horizon.  At first I thought it was a shooting star, but then it seemed  to zigzag. I was seated on an a lawn chair on a slope overlooking a bay there was not much obscuring my view  except a clump of pine trees. The star disapeared behind the stand of trees. I thought it had fizzled. A full two to three seconds elapsed, and it reappeared going the same direction and same speed, toward grand Manan. I shouted   You're not supposed to do that!.
