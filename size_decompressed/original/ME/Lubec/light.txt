((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-25 20:35:00;10 minutes;Two strings of bright white lights (50-60 in total), appeared like a train in the night sky. Observed a string of 30-40 objects very high in the night sky travelling at a magnetic compass bearing of 150 degrees ESE.  They appeared as bright white lights evenly spaced in groups of 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, with no logical pattern of grouping.  Fast moving, silent, they appeared like a train in the sky.  After about 5 minutes, a second group of exactly 20 lights travelling at the same bearing passed by.  My wife and I both saw the lights.  They were spotted at approximately above the sliver moon, which was below Venus.  We watched them pass over the house and head in a direction towards Grand Manan Island, Canada, and suddenly vanish in the night sky.;44.9043;-67.0408
