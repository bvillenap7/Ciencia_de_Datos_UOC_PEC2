This was in South Portland Maine, The Airport (PWM) is approximately 4 air miles away. Neither Vehicle had any collision markers flashing at all only the orange glow, Both vehicles executed a slight easterly turn towards the ocean and the lights faded.  The sky was clear no clouds.  No sound could be heard coming from them either that we noticed.  Any planes approaching the airport usually come in from south to north not north to south. The whole incident lasted about 45 seconds to 1 min 30 seconds.  Both vehicles were heading towards oncoming aircraft approaching PWM.  Definately should not have been routed that way by air traffic control.;43.6327969121139;-70.2731052256528
