Large triangle craft moving slow over Maine Mall area.;2016-04-05 02:40:00;5 minutes;Large triangle craft moving slow over Maine Mall area. Somewhere around 0236-ish While riding in a car, saw bright light halfway above horizon, dismissed it as a bright Venus, but I didn’t think the direction was correct.  As we got closer, could see head on, two bright “headlights” with two small blinking lights, one on either side. We drove underneath it, and then I realized it was either moving very slow or not at all.  From underneath, could see the light, almost grayish, color of the triangle against a clear dark sky.  In the triangle were 3 larger lights on the points, and a series of many smaller lights forming an inner diamond.  Outside of the colored portion where you could only see black sky, were the blinking lights, one on each side, one red, one green. The driver of the car thought me crazy, and didn’t want to look at it.  So we kept the same speed, drove head on, underneath, then away, in about the course of a mile or less, with me watching it the entire time.  I could only hear the sound of the car we were in. I’m trying to dismiss it as a drone or secret plane, but the size, slowness, and definitive shape were a very new sight for me.  I’m not sure of the height because I’m not sure of the size, but I could see actual details in the underside like I was looking at model plane up close, but there were too many to recall with accuracy.
