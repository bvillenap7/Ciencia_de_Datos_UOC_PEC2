bright white light darts horizon to horizon in 15 seconds;2010-06-18 21:58:00;15 seconds;bright white light darts horizon to horizon in 15 seconds Bright light that caught the corner of my eye when I exited my hot tub to go inside.  My split second perception was that two stars were merging as it was a very clear night.  I realized that it was a craft, non blinking, that was moving in a straight line at an incredible speed.  It made no noise and it appeared to be very high in the atmosphere.  I have witnessed a night time launch of the space shuttle, I have seen meteors galore,  and watched satellites go by...but I never saw anything move this quick.  It went horizon to horizon in 15 seconds.  Maybe I caught the rumored Aurora....I don't know...but the object was a consistent bright white and was moving from south to north.  Hope that helps.  This seemed like a good place to place my sighting as I didn't know where else to post.;43.6327969121139;-70.2731052256528
Red lights glowing over Casco Bay, Maine;2012-07-26 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;Red lights glowing over Casco Bay, Maine July 26, 2012 Saw red lights hovering in sky over Willard Beach area of South Portland Maine.  First one appeared and seemed to move slowly emitting a reddish glow and floated upwards and disappeared.  A second light appeared in the same area and remained for about 5+mins before moving upwards, changing color to be more white than red and disappeared again.  We do have a photo however it doesnâ€™t do justice to what we saw.;43.6327969121139;-70.2731052256528
