yellow/white light seen from about three miles away;2008-08-05 20:25:00;30 Seconds;yellow/white light seen from about three miles away Saw a bright light to my left driving from Guilford to Dexter this evening which would be west/southwest of the truck.  The particular part of the road can see a cell tower in which to the right of it was the object.  It appeared very bright (almost like Venus) but seemed to dim a lot and eventually disapated after looking at the same location about a minute up the road. Very low in the sky. It looked sort of circular and bright yellow/white and as it dimmed it went into a diamond shape, top being the widest. It was still dusk and could still see the outline of trees and the sky was dark blue. The object was about 3 miles west of my location on the road. After driving down the road a bit I felt odd sensations but nothing too particular. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
