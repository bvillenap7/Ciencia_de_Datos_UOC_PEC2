Bright light moving fast across the sky.;2015-08-13 21:00:00;30 seconds;Bright light moving fast across the sky. Brightest light In the sky, looked like the brightest star moving across the sky faster than any plane.  Video taped it and couldn't see any other stars on my iphone video due to them apparently not being bright enough, even though it's very clear skies.  I see a solid 200 stars tonight.   Other planes in sight as well with flashing lights I tried to compare in the video but the plane lights didn't even pick up on the video, just the single light moving from one end of my visual sky to the other and disappearing into the sky not clouds, just gone.  Moved way faster than the plane that was in the sky at the exact same time I could see both and compare for a solid 30 seconds.
