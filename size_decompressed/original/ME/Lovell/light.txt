Very dim flashing white light moving quitely, eratically, and misteriously across the sky.;2004-08-22 23:00:00;60-90seconds;Me and my uncle were gazing at planets and stars through his telescope. We decided to take a little break and just gaze at the stars for a moment. It was a good idea because we saw a couple of shooting stars. About 3 minutes later i noticed an extremely faint light around where i saw a falling star just moments ago. It was odd because it appeared to be extremely farther away farther than a satellite we just saw go bye. So we knew it couldnt be a satellite. It would flash rapidly and stop for 5-10 seconds then reappear. For the first 30 seconds i was watching it, it was stationary. Then it began to move at a pretty rapid speed across the sky. It made its way half way across the sky then and made a almost a complete u-turn and darted off in the other direction. That night it was crystal clear, clearer than it has been in a long while. And where he lives the is no light polution what so ever. We gaze at stars on a constant basis, but this is the first time we saw anything of the sort. It was a very dim flashing white light moving quitely, eratically, and misteriously across the sky. The funny part is, we saw no more shooting stars after that. The light the object emitted waz very faint and hazy to see;44.1592;-70.9335
