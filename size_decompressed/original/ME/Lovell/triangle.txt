Black Triangle over Lake Kezar in Lovell Maine in the Late 1980's;1989-07-01 23:00:00;5 - 10 Minutes;Black Triangle over Lake Kezar in Lovell Maine in the Late 1980's It was in the summer time in the late 1980’s at night. I was with my family looking at the stars on a boat in the middle of lake Kezar in Lovell, Maine when a very large black triangle ship silently flew lowly over us. I didn’t see any lights, but I could be wrong. I did see what looked like windows on the side. Not 100% sure about the windows. I don’t remember it taking on water, but it could of before we saw it. It flew directly in the middle of the lake, and from the projected flight path it might of took prior it could of spent a few miles over the lake. After it flew over us it went into the mountains. It last about 5-10 minutes. Unfortunately I don’t remember the exact date, but know it was in the summertime in the late 80’s. My family can verify the sighting, but they don’t remember the date either. As far as I know an early date for a black triangle sighting.

triangle shapes hovering over Kezar Lake at sunset.;2009-09-19 19:05:00;3-5 min;triangle shapes hovering over Kezar Lake at sunset. Myself and 4 others were on top if a mountain watching the sun set.  Over Kezar Lake we noticed two triangular very dark shapes literally hovering like a kit in the wind.  However, these objects were several hundreds of feet in the air.   One of the black shapes went left about 30 yards a literally dissipated right in front of our eyes.  The second object still hovering did the exact same thing in a slightly different direction.   We all literally watched the second object in motion go from solid mass into a light grey partially see through and then gone right before our very eyes. Has anyone else seen this before?;44.1592;-70.9335
