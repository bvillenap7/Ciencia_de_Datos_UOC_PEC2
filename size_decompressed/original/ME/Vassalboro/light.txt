circular  light/orange craft out running a pursuing military helicopter;2009-12-04 04:50:00;3 to 5 minutes;circular  light /orange craft out running a pursuing military helicopter As I was driving down route 201 south to augusta I saw what appeared to be bright orange light, circular in shape, traveling parallel to me. Trailing it was a convential aircraft of some kind, because I could see the strobe lights at the base, tail of the aircraft. As I drove down the road the craft passed diagnol to my position about three or four miles from my position, followed by the other aircraft in pursuit. All of a sudden the light took off and left the second aircraft far behind and it did not slow down till I lost sight of it. As I finally pulled into my parking lot at the condo, I identified the craft that had been following the circular light. My father and I have been attending airshows since I was five and I can identify every convential, man made aircraft in the world. So as I was walking in overhead flew a Black Hawk helicopter, I assume is stationed with the medivac unti based out of Bangor Maine. They are a constant presence in the air here! in the kennebec county airspace and ther engine sound and cavatation noise of there rotors are unmistakable. I know aircraft, and I know what a planet or a star, or meteorite looks lik and this was not any of those. There was a planet shinning brightly in the sky tonight but this object was no where near that planet.;44.4432;-69.6481
