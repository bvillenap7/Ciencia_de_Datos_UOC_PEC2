It was cylindrical in shape, lower than a jetliner would pass over and much bigger than a jet fusilage.  There appeared to be a small rectangular shape on the side back about one third the length of the object.   As it passed from view behind trees in my yard, I ran out beyond them but it had disappeared.   The sky was clear ant the temperature was about seventy-five degrees Fahrenheit.;44.4432;-69.6481
