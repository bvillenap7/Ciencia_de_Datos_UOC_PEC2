No sound at all, 6 witnesses My family and I were sitting around a fire roasting marshmallows, all of a sudden my sister (age 27) started freaking out, My dad age (48) was asking what she was freaking out about she couldnt get the words out of her mouth fast enough so she was just pointing and screaming. I witnessed a neon blue SUPER bright light hovering appx a 1/2 mile away, It was about 300ft above the ground and slowly descending. It was hard to tell what shape the light was attached to but seemed like a disk shape, the light was so bright it made a huge beam all the way to the ground until it was within tree level and unable to be seen. At this time my whole family had seen it, a very unusal thing that also happened was all the neighborhood dogs began to bark continuously. There was no sound that came from the craft itself, The sky was completely clear, there was no wing markers or anything else on the ufo that lead us to believe it was a typical airplane or helocopter. Im now a fi! rm believer of UFO's;44.022;-70.1168
