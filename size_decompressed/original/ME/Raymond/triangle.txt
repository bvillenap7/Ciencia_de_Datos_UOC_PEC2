And with extreme precision at about airplane level. My daughter(15) was on the school bus at about 2:30 pm yesterday(Nov.18) when she looked out the bus window and saw 2 blackish triangular objects flying toward each other,slowly and with great precision. She thought to herself Gee, I'm impressed! How do they do that! There was no sound emitting from them at all. She looked at the girl sitting closest to her and said Did you see that?! The girl said yes in a disbelieving way.  My daughter is a sophomore in high school, is very levelheaded, doesnot do drugs or alcohol.;43.923;-70.4551
