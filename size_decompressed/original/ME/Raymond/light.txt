On the night of October/12/2014 at 8:45pm Eastern Standard Time in Raymond, Maine.  I was walking outside to get my work cloth out of my car to was and I notice in clouds over a dozen faint oval lights moving very fast and then they would pause in the night skys clouds. I thought they might be spot lights and I decided to call the are local dispatch Cumberland County Sheriffs.  They told me they didnt know what the lightswhere but there was nothing on the ground that they could find.  I noticed there was nothing shining on the ground or a trail of light shining up from the ground.  They would move in a pattern formation and a group of them would start to spin like a ferris wheel and then they would shoot from one side of the clouds to another.  What kept getting me was they would stop.  The police also told I was the fourth person to call at that point.  I called at 9:00pm.  The next morning I was running errands and I ran to a neighbor that asked if I had seen them! also. Several people witnessed the event.  It lasted over an hour.   I have called the local news media twice and I emailed them once.  I tried contacting the Maine Air National Guard.  I just want to find out whag I shaw in the sky.  If you research this the police will confirm that others called dispatch and reported the lights.  I just want answers.  I tried to record them with my camera on my phone but I wasnt able to pick them up.  My father and brother witness them also.;43.923;-70.4551
