Greenish, white orb appears and drops straight to the ground.;2021-01-07 17:00:00;5 seconds;Greenish, white orb appears and drops straight to the ground. On January 7th at around 5:00pm I was driving on Rte 9 from Wells, to North Berwick, As I crossed over the bridge, just before Pratt and Whitney I noticed a greenish white light just appear about 3 times the height of the tree line and drop straight to the ground until it was out of my sight.  At that point I drove in the direction I saw the light fall,  But I didn't see any more at that time.  The light was about the size of a basketball and fell with immense speed.;43.3119000000001;-70.5979000000004
