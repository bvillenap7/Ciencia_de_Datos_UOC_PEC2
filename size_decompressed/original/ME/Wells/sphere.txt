My wife and I were just leaving our friends house in Wells Maine along route 1 when we saw in front of us a couple hundred feet up a pair of bright orange glowing spheres traveling from south to north along the coast line and a moderate pace.  We found it strange that they emitted no noise.  Other cars stopped to observe this as well.  No one knew what these were.  They went out of site after a few minutes.;43.3119000000001;-70.5979000000004
