Extremely large ball of light streaking from east to west.;2012-11-28 23:45:00;1-2 seconds;Extremely large ball of light streaking from east to west. My girlfriend and I were standing outside when all of a sudden a huge light moved across the sky moving east to west.  It was as least as bright as the almost full moon.  It was so bright it lit the ground up and I could see the shadows of the trees move as it moved over our house.  It only last a second or two almost like a shooting star but it was much much larger and brighter.  I thought maybe it was a meteor but I never saw or heard it impact the ground.;43.8576;-70.1044
