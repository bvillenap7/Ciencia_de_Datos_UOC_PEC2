Daylight Disk;2005-07-04 19:15:00;5 minutes;Daylight Disk My brother(53) and I (47) had just finished dinner on our patio.  We had two patriotic kites flying for the Fourth which were tied off. When looking at one of the kites my brother saw the object and asked me what I thought it was. The object looked like a planet but was almost at our zenith many tens of degrees above the ecliptic. The object moved back and forth in an erratic manner several times. At other times it would remain in one place. The object was fairly bright and about the size of BB held at arms length. After watching the object for few munitesI went inside to get some binoculars for a better look and upon returning my brother said the object just vanished.;43.8576;-70.1044
