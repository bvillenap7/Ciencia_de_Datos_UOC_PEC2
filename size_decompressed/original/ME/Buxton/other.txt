I thought it was a star but it was blinking, so I kept a close eye on it.  When I got to it, the object was about 3 feet behind a leafless tree staying perfectly still near Lows Variety.  I knew it wasn't a lamp post because there was nothing holding it up.  So I slowed down and stopped and watch it.  I rolled down the window and turned off my music and I couldn't hear anything at all.  After about 30 seconds I got ready to go again and it started moving.   It ended up going over the river to where it became hard to keep an eye on it so I drove up the hill a bit (maybe 100 feet max) and looked back and it was gone.  I had a good view of the entire area and then some but there was no shadow, lights, or moving objects. Description: Moved about 1.5 feet per second/really slow and was between 1 and 2 feet tall with about 6 inches of body behind it.  At first it appeared circular but after it started to move I realized it had some really odd shape to it.  It had a curved top and two legs.  One left and one right.  In the center of the top half was a trapezoid type shape that glowed a yellowish orange.  The left leg had a blue light and the right side a red light.
