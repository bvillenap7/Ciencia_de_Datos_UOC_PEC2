Black Triangle in Northern Maine!!!;2012-06-19 22:10:00;5 minutes;Black Triangle in Northern Maine!!! My wife, my friend, and myself were out fishing this night and noticed that there was a light off in the distance.  We kept on fishing and began to notice that the object in the sky was getting closer to us and the lights were getting brighter.  They were in the shape of a backwards triangle at first then when it got closer to us you could see that it was actually in the shape of a diamond.  This whole time my friend was taping the craft and then asked me to take over the camera for him.  I zoomed in as far as the camera would let me to try and make out the shape of the object and when i zoomed back out i could see that it was hovering over us for quite some time.  I want to know what this was because it scared the life out of us all..  And of course the only sounds that you could hear are the frogs, the campfire that we had going and also our voices talking to let people know that we did not turn the volume off.;45.6574;-68.7102
