They had talked for about a minute when my father-in-law screamed my name.  He told me to get out and look at the sky.  It was and egg shaped craft fully lit up, as if it was glowing.  It had a small trail, but nothing like a comet.  It flew very low over the tree line, horizontally across the sky.  30 seconds later, it couldn't be seen.
