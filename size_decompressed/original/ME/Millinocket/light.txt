What first appeared to be a satellite suddenly and abrubtly stopped and then shot straight up, judging from it's distance, well over a few thousand feet.  Then, it shot straight down and proceeded to move foward towards us again.  At this time the brightly lit object was approx 10-50 miles away.  We watched the object continue to move closer towards us for the next ten minutes and as it conducted a couple more W shaped manuevers where it would stop, shoot up, down at an angle and then up again before proceeding on course again.   Finally after watching for approx. twenty minutes the light proceeded to accelerate and gradually turn skyward away and to the left of us like it was heading into outer space at a rapid rae of speed until we finally lost sight of it. It was a surreal experience and my second such sighting in the Northern Maine area. Things that make ya go Hmmmmmmm? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
