Orbs of light watching me.;2002-08-16 19:45:00;3 hours;Orbs of light watching me it all started that night around dusk.  I looked up to see two jet airliners heading northeast. as the first jet got closer I noticed a ball of light coming out of the northern sky.  It looked like It was going to hit the plane but it was only 1000 to 2000 feet up and the plane was 20000 feet up.  I could not believe the pilot did not see it and then banked left to avoid.  The plane following  made a slight turn left all the planes that night made same turn to avoid this spot.  a couple hours later I watched five balls of white light playing in eastern sky and for some reason I sensed they knew I was watching them.  the five of them hid in a star formation cassipeia ?  I knew they were there but they did not move. I never took my eyes off of them. a half hour has gone by still no movement.  then I notice dim light 150 feet away from me on ground.  I went over to see it closer. it was 5 lights very dim shining on ground on  the same spot they were over lapping one ano! ther. I was still watching them and they were watching me. I went back to where I was sitting. another 30 to 45 minutes went by still no movement. I had to go in the house but did not want to leave. so I called there bluff. I went to where the lights were shinning on ground looked up at them and said I must be seeing things? so I shrugged my shoulders and headed toward house. the whole time watching them while I walked away from them. when I got to my door out of there sight all five of them moved off there spots and headed in a southeast direction. I yelled at them as they drifted off I knew you were there! this is only one of very many sightings I see most happen first week of august to the third week. I also have abduction story in Alaska. and many in house abduction were at night they come take blood and put things in me or take things out of me.  I would like to go to hospital but I get this feeling I would be betraying them I feel they have helped me. and they really like my A negative blood every 3 months more needle marks appea! r. well I will end this here. good bye and may alien be with you!;44.9217;-67.0044
