((anonymouf report));2019-08-20 21:30:00;10 seconds;Large circle or triangle shape craft with many pulsating lights around craft See field light up bright next to house while getting in my vehicle with my son.  stopped and watched it, see giant disc or triangle shape craft with pulsating lights, guessing 10 to 12 lights, coming right towards us just over tree Line,   jumped in vehicle in a panic feeling  and watched go directly over us and had red and purple colors in center,  watched go by us and over trees headed northeast and seemed to accelerate, took 5 seconds to get directly  over us and maybe 2 or 3 seconds and gone, flying about 100-200 ft above tree line, window down watching it directly above and watched disappear to NE, looked black or dark colored and absolutely no sound!  So low u could hear the air being cut, also never seen any plane or any aircraft in that part of sky in 30 years,  itâ€™s too populated and is in no-fly area.
