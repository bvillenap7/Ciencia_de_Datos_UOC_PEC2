The outline was in amber (orange) lights, and thought this to be unusual, also the size was amazing. Judging by the distance it was from me I would have to guess it was as large as a football field in length.  I took my eyes off it for a second because I was driving, when I looked again it had changed shape to a triangle and three bright lights took the place of the amber lights.  There was no sound. I started to pull over to have a good look at what this was, when there was a bright flash that lit up the tree tops.  When I look at where the object was it had disappeared. No there was no sound.  At first I thought I was looking at a giant air plane because the amber lights were outlined in the shape of a commercial jet, but huge.  I have seen other occurrences here also but did not want to report them because they are weird.  Two others to be exact.  Bath shipyards are here in bath where they build destroyers for the navy. Missile destroyers.  I worked at the shipyard at the time of the sightings.;43.9041;-69.8302
