Orange lights that changed to bright white;1999-09-15 09:00:00;2 minutes;Orange lights that changed to bright white I live in Bath Maine and have seen several objects I cannot explain. BNAS (Brunswick Naval Air Base)  Is near by so I know these planes, also Portland Jet port commercial planes are easily identified. One night while working for a engineering outfit in Poland springs I thought I was seeing a satellite  passing overhead. I used my field glasses to look at it and it appeared star like. It moved very slowly. But to my amazement it made a U turn and started back toward the direction it came  from. I have no idea what it could have been.  It traveled what to me seemed miles before turning back. On another occasions, and this really frightened me, I was going to work at the shipyard where I work. It was about 9:30 at night. I looked to my left and sitting up in the sky was an object with orange light in the outline of a commercial jet. But this was way to large to be a jet and it was not moving.  It just sat there what I believed to be right over the river. I drove on a block before looking back up. The orange lights were replaced by 3 large white lights in the shape of a triangle. Very huge. I set my eyes back on the road and suddenly there was this bright light that seemed to me like someone setting off a flash on a camera. It lit up the trees and the rooftops, and when I looked back the object was gone.   This object to me later as I went over itâ€™s size had to be as big as a football field, or damn near as big.
