It was moving in a east to west. It then changed direction and move west to east.  AS it did so it changed colors, from white to red and then blinked out.;43.9041;-69.8302

I thought it was strange and kept looking...about 10 seconds later I saw a second &quotplane&quot in the sky with the same orange light.  I decided to pull into an empty parking area and get a good look.  When I looked east again, there were 2 more in the sky heading west.  The strange thing was that these &quotplanes&quot were absolutely silent...and just a flickering orange light under the object.  I took video of it burble is difficult to grasp the size and description of the object.    A woman in another car came over to me and asked if I knew what these things were?!  We both saw the same thing and simply couldn't imagine what we were seeing!!!  Any ideas?????;43.9041;-69.8302
