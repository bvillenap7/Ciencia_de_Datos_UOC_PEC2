Bright, singular, blueish-white orb-like sighting.;2015-07-04 00:00:00;15 minutes;Bright, singular, blueish-white orb-like sighting. Just after sunset my nephew, brother in-law and sister noticed a very bright singular light moving at a steady paces from SW heading NE.  This light changed its direction an brightened an dimmed at various times throughout the sighting.  I have had similar experiences with a similar light many times.  Living very close to the airport I know this is no aircraft for sure!   I also have pictures and videos of similar sightings from a variety of dates since my first sighting of this nature.  I also have attempted to communicate using a very high watt LED flashlight whenever I do see them and I seem to get there attention having mimicing responses to my sequences of flashing my light.  An have also encountered them coming back around several times from all different directions in one sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
