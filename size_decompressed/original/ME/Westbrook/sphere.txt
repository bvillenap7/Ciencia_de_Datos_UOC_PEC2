moving stars that disappear;2005-07-03 22:20:00;3 minutes;moving stars that disappear It started when me and my friend were riding our bikes up around the usual neighborhood. We stopped for a minute as we watched 4 motorcyclist ride by. My friend said  hey whats that, I said what. He showed me it as he was in a rush. Up in the sky it looked to me as if it was a bright, large, moving star. If i had to explain it i would say that it looked kinda like a fast moving north star. After about 5-10 seconds it was in the other side of the sky and started to go behind trees until we couldnt see it no more. We were fascinated so we stayed there for about a minute. Then all of a sudden my friend said OMG, look theres another one. This time it looked exactly like the other one except it was going in almost the exact opposite direction(maybe 10-15 degrees off) and it also came out from behind the trees that the other one went into.It was going a little bit faster than the other one though. At this point we thought that this was just the coolest thing ever. And same as the other, it just was across the sky in mabye 4-8 seconds then disappeared.(Way too fast for any man-made object.) About 45 seconds after that one was gone the last one appeared. It looked the same and was moving the same speed although this one was the most unusual. It seemed to come out of no-where. If you look strait up in the sky, thats where it came from. From where I was standing it was moving to my left. After about 3 seconds it only moved so far then it was gone. It just vanished.;43.6820432432432;-70.3583405405405
Blueish white sphere, no sounds even when directly overhead, brightened, dimmed, then disappeared.;2016-07-04 21:45:00;2 minutes;Blueish white sphere, no sounds even when directly overhead, brightened, dimmed, then disappeared. As fireworks were going on in the distance I observed a bright orb shaped object slowly approaching from the distance.   I pulled my iphone out and began trying to capture this object on video.  This isn't the first observation of similar objects.   I have multiple videos of these objects.  I know for a fact these object are not planes or any other aircraft I have ever seen.   I live within 5 miles from the Portland International Airport PWM.  And I've lived here for over 10 yrs.  Never have I seen anything like this before my first siting.
