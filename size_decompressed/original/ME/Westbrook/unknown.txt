Face to face encounter.;1990-06-30 01:00:00;Unknown;Face to face encounter. When I was a child I dealt with ongoing contact with ETs.  This started when I was very young, around the age of 6.  I was awoken several times to either a blinding white light or white light that flashed twice. This report covers one incident but my timeline is over years. I woke in pitch blackness to a sense that something terrifying was about to happen.  I had a bunk bed with my brother.  I was on the top bunk.  I saw one bright white flash of light and so I lifted my head to stare at our door.  I could hear something coming up the stairs.  I heard it open my older brother's door and then open mine.  Through the door walked 5 foot or so ET.  It looked like a classic gray.  Abnormally long fingers.. three or four of them. Eyes that looked like a classic gray, a slit for a mouth but no real nose.  More of a bump and two small holes without nostrils.  It walked along the wall to my right and was looking down at my brother.  The ET was within arms reach, staring down at him.  I was scared but not so scared that I couldn't react or move.  Instead it was hard to move, as if something was done to keep me in place. It then noticed that I was conscious and looking at it. When it did it snapped its head up and stared into my eyes for a few seconds.  It then leaned a bit to the right and reached up and over the bedside at me with its left hand.  My arm was laying out beside me with my hand hanging over the edge.  I managed to ball up a fist and try to punch it.  I managed more of a tap.  It recoiled its hand back and took a step back as if it were confused.  It then started walking towards the door while keeping an eye on me. A bit of my background:  I am a veteran of the USCG. I work in IT, recently for the largest company in the world. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.  PD);43.6820432432432;-70.3583405405405
