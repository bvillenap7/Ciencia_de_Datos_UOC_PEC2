Silent and  Unknown.;2005-08-12 22:00:00;10 minutes;Silent and  Unknown A friend  and I were sitting near a lake at her campground when I noticed a bright light across the lake, it wasnt moving just sitting there. I asked her what it was and she just laughed and said a UFO.  I laughed also but then the light disapeared,I asked her if she seen where it went and she  said uhhh no then it reapeared again I panicked and got up  and she  told me to wait and watch it,It then started to move towards us over the lake  I jumped up and just watched  as it came closer, there was a very bright light  that was very blinding ,there was no noise following it so we knew it wasnt a  helicopter or anything. As it passed over us( which was right over the tree line) we began chasing under it ,As I was looking up  the light was so bright but you could kind of make out little lights on the sides of it I was running under it but triped and fell over a rock ,while my friend was helping me up  we both looked up and it was gone ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
