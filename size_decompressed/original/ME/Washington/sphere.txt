Very unusual sphere with multiple flashing colored lights, high in the southwestern sky.;2009-03-31 20:00:00;2 + hrs;Very unusual sphere with multiple flashing colored lights, high in the southwestern sky. In the southwestern sky, high on the horizon, we watched for over two hours an object the size of 3 large bright stars that stayed in one position and flashed various colors of light such as white, red, green, turquoise, and purple. With the naked eye, it was visible.  With a spotting scope,it was incredible. Small parts would pulsate with the same colors and break off the original just to reattach again. I contacted the county police, who referred me to the state police, who referred me to the FAA, and the local TV station.  All were very unconcerned.  The gentleman from the FAA did say he heard on the news there was supposed to be some sort of event in the southeastern sky in the Boston area, but he didn't know anything more.  It's very frustrating to try to convince anyone especially the police, to just step ouside their vehicle and look up!;44.2692;-69.3895
