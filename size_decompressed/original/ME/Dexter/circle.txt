As my wife, her cousin and our 14 year old nephew were sitting outside talking about or day in our church trip to bangor, I noticed two round objects moving nothwest to souteast in the southern sky. They did not have any blinking lights, rather bright white objects following each othe very quickly.  As I watched, I got up from my chair and noticed the objects getting dimmer as the appeared to travel away.  Airplanes would have remained visible, these two just vanished.  Please do not remove my name as I am telling you this as truth as God is my wittness. Feel free to contact me at j((e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  ISS in formation with Space Shuttle??
