I am sure most of these get dis-regarded as mine probably will also, but I truly believe my friends and I saw a UFO over the past summer.  We were out on a private beach in Kittery point waiting for another friend of ours to get home.  It was getting kind of boring, and I was just watching the sky.  At one point I noticed a really slow-moving plane type thing flying away in the distance.  I said something to my friends and pointed up at the craft, and as soon as I raised my hand in it's direction the object turned on a dime.  It made a very tight turn and flew directly over us.   As it was getting closer, I could see that it was not very high up from the ground.  The other strange thing about it was that the craft was sort of triangular with a big green light in the front.   I don't think I would have believed it was a UFO nearly as much if I hadn't turned on the T.V the next day and immediately seen a show on the history channel about UFO's, and the UFO's the! y said had thousands of sightings over Bolivia and other foreign countries looked almost exactly like what I thought we had seen.   I shall follow your requests to leave out contact info, but please feel free to contact me if possible.  I would be more than willing to answer questions or here other stories and whatnot about sightings. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));43.0973;-70.7176
