Flashing, Hovering Craft Seen for A Long Period of time in Casco, Maine.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??  PD));2018-12-25 21:00:00;Ongoing;Flashing, Hovering Craft Seen for A Long Period of time in Casco, Maine. Was driving east on route 302, and spotted a red, green, (I know its Christmas but this is NO hoax...) and blue flashing lights…  Watched it from the lake edge for about a half hour with and without binoculars...Lights were flashing very quickly, appeared once or twice to expel something from the lights...through binoculars it is obviously a small object hovering anywhere from 200-600 feet up.  What I dont know is WHAT the HECK that was. I've seen some weird shit in my life, but that one, friend, takes the cake.  It was moving up and down, left and right in a slow and deliberate motion…  I apologize in advance for the quality.  Oh, and for a short time the neighbor's dog was going INSANE barking at it. Also, it appears this particular object is, as far as I can tell, round(ish?) and about the size of a minivan.  Hard to tell with all the flashing.  Heading back out to get pictures and hopefully not get abducted in the process…  Not far from Betty and Barney country out here... I'm a 37 year old male btw, and I wouldn't waste my time making up internet stories.;43.9603;-70.5206
