Diamond shape.;2017-04-23 21:30:00;5 minutes;i was outside on my deck to have a cigarette and i looked up at the stars as i often do and i seen this purple/ blue diamond shape descending to the east of my location which would be the umo ((i.e., Univ. of Maine at Orono)) field.  it descended  at a downward angle and as it went below the tree line i ran inside to get my video camera and car keys and i drove to the umo field to hopefully video tape what i seen. to my avail there was nothing there. this object i seen did not make a sound and at the bottom of the diamond shape it appeared to have a fire ball to it;44.8921596491229;-68.7171421052633
