Bright red ball of light movong at rapid speeds and jets flying towards it;2012-11-05 02:00:00;3 minutes;bright red ball of light movong at rapid speeds and jets flying towards it Last night I saw a bright red light blinking in the sky and moving quicker than any plane could.   After watching the light for a minute I heard and saw a jet scramble by.   Then again on 11/6/12 I saw th bright red blinking light.  The light looks way different than any other light i have seen.  Me and 3 others witnessed this and again you can hear a jet to begin flying towards the light.  Very weird.;44.8921596491229;-68.7171421052633
