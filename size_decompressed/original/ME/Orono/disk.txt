Silent Lo-flying Craft with Dome and Bright White Lights;1989-10-01 21:30:00;15-20 seconds;Silent Lo-flying Craft with Dome and Bright White Lights The following account is related here as told to me by my sister.  The approximate coordinates of the house from which my sister observed the UFO are:  44:55:00 N   68:41:00 W   In the fall of 1989, my sister, then 16 years old, returned home after seeing a movie with a friend. It was probably between 9:30 and 10pm.  She looked out of her bedroom window and saw a large, gray object with a dome top and one or more rows of white lights around the lower edge. There was one very bright light illuminating the path ahead of the object, which was flying just high enough to clear the tree tops --  (probably 50-75 feet above ground level) She estimated it to be about the size of an average house.  What struck her most was that the object made absolutely no noise, and was traveling too slowly to be an airplane. The bedroom window faces due north, and the flight path was south, toward the house. When the craft passed over the house she ran to a back window to see if she could catch another glimpse, but she saw it just for a second as it disappeared behind the tree line and disappeared.  My sister was slightly shaken by the incident, but did not tell anyone about the sighting for years because she feared ridicule. She eventually told me and one or two others.  I have heard many accounts of sightings.  This one is unique because I do not believe it would be possible for my sister to imagine or create what she described.  She has always been a very down-to-earth, responsible, and realistic person. She is a college graduate with a degree in Human Development, was the director of a private pre-school for several years, and is currently a Case Worker for a Social Services Agency.  She was a popular, well-behaved high school student with good grades and had no reason to seek attention. (She doesn't even like science fiction!)  The only nearby military airports are unlikely to be involved in experimental aviation. There is an ANG refueling wing at KBGR (8 miles) operating KC-135 aircraft, and a Medical unit with Huey and Bell helicopters. Brunswick Naval Air Station is nearly 100 miles away. I believe Loring AFB was still operational at the time of the sighting it is almost 200 miles to the north.  My sister provided a pencil sketch of what she saw which will be submitted.  If you have any questions about the incident, please feel welcome to contact me via e-mail and I will contact my sister. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));44.8921596491229;-68.7171421052633
The object  was about the size of a full moon, had red and white lights, then vanished.;2004-10-28 21:33:00;15 seconds;The object  was about the size of a full moon, had red and white lights, then vanished. My eyes were glued to the T.V., when all of a sudden i saw these odd red and white lights get my attention, but then after about 5 seconds they went away.  This got my attention emidiatly. i stood up and looked out my window to get a closer look.  All of a sudden, they came back.  The lights were circling around on a soucer, and you could tell the object was disc shape.  The object was about the size of a full moon, and maybe 1-2 miles away.  Then the lights vanished.  When the lights vanished, it seemed as thought the object itself did too.  Then, about 5 seconds later, they came back.  The colors didn't change. The object was moving south.  I couldn't hear any noise though. I was inside, my tv was pretty loud and it was 1-2 miles away.  The lights only went for about 3 seconds when they finally vanished and never came back.;44.8921596491229;-68.7171421052633
