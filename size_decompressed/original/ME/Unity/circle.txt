A circular form with different colored lights around the periphery was moving through the night sky - it appeared that the lights were moving in a circle (how I knew it was a circle shape).  Quite high up - like as high as a jet would fly.  No noise.  It did not stop.  Was moving north to west.;44.5974;-69.3314
