Parallel lights moving east across Shapleigh, ME.;2013-07-03 20:30:00;2 minutes;Parallel lights moving east across Shapleigh, ME. My family was visiting some friends on Mousam lake in Shapleigh, ME,  on July 3, 2013.  At dusk, we decided to go out onto the lake to watch the annual fireworks display.  There were multiple adults and several children on our boat.  We travelled from the east side of the lake south approximately a few minutes to where the lake intersected with Route 109. While making our way south, one of the adults noticed 2 lights travelling from the west to east direction across the lake.  These lights took approximately one minute to travel from the west to the east side of the lake.  As we continued to watch these two lights, they seemed to disappear.  We thought there might have been some cloud cover there.  We discussed that the lights seemed a bit strange and that they didn't make any noise, but chalked them up to released Japanese lanterns.  We continued to head south. Facing approximately south west, we watched the fireworks display until the sun went down.  We then decided to to head north up the lake and enjoy the smaller fireworks displays.  At this time we witnessed the same lights, traveling in the same direction.  Again, we thought they were odd, but convinced ourselves they must have been two more japanaes lanterns in parallel.  Although as I followed them this time, they disappeared in the same fashion as the other pair, but this time there was what appeared to be a shooting star right in that area.;43.5674;-70.8286
