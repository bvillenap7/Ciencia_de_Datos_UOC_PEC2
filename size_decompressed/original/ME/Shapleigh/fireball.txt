Seconds later this ball of fire appeared to stop moving for a short time, then I realized it was slowing moving upward.   Around 11:15pm it started darting back and forth and then it disappeared out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
