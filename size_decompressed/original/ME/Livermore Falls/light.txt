Two Orange/Reddish Craft moving slowly across Livermore Falls, Maine, blinking on and off;2013-08-24 20:50:00;3 minutes;Two Orange/Reddish Craft moving slowly across Livermore Falls, Maine, Blinking on and off I was getting ready for a Live show for Youtube when My friends yelled for me to come out side, When I did I heard them say there are UFO's over the river.  So ran out and had my iPhone in hand,  When I seen the objects I first looked for an explanation like maybe a Helicopter or Plane,  But there was No identifying Lights Just a Bright Orange/Red Lights One one each object,  They were pulsing on and off, they stayed at the same speed. One was above the other and ahead of it but they both stayed at the same speeds. I stood trying to Identify them first before I took out my camera.  After looking at them for about 30 seconds I realized they were completely silent, Large, and moving too slow for any Helicopter or Airplane.  They glowed a orange reddish color and then blinked out on and off at the same time.  Me and My 2 friends I believe both witnessed a UFO, I am a Researcher on Conspiracy Theories and of the Paranormal, I new what to rule out and what to look for. ! These lights were solid crafts and large. They moved off slowly. I managed to capture a Short video of them with my iPhone but it was very short because my battery in my phone went dead because of all the videos I was taking while My friends and I were in town. I will upload the short clip to my Youtube  Channel Named MrJasrene1.This was my second ufo encounter in 6 years. The lights blinked out but they moved a good amount of distance. After that My live show on Youtube was mostly about the encounter I had, that video is on My Second Channel named TheFutureTechIdeas.;44.4343;-70.1377
