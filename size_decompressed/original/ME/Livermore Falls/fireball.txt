It finally split into two distinct balls of bright orange fiery lights about 1000 feet above and ahead of us.;1997-08-29 21:30:00;15 minutes;My mother and I were travelling west on Rte 17 in fayette at the time of the initial incident. I pointed out through the windshield to a small bright orange light hovering in the night sky. We watched as I drove slowly trying to keep an eye on the road at the same time. The light seemed to shine and glimmer as if a star or satellite does to the naked eye. I turned on to a side road we used for a shortcut home. As I slowed more to keep an eye on the object, it seemed to grow in size. I stopped the car but did not get out. We kept watching as it grew bigger and bigger. It finally split into two distinct balls of bright orange fiery lights about 1000 feet above and ahead of us. It made no noise as it glided directly over the roof of our car. However, the car and ground shook as it passed and there was a slight rumbling as it passed. I tried to watch it by looking through the back window. We were both a little shook up and I decided to just take off. At the time I lived in Wilton. Which was about 15 miles further away. When we arrived at my house I looked up into the night sky to see a dim orange light fading into the darkness. The disappearing act took about 2 minutes and then it was gone for good.
