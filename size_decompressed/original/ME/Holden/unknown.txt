High altitude object??????;2016-01-06 21:30:00;2 hours;High Altitude object?????? I was outside on my deck smoking a cigarette and was looking up @ stars.  Something I do on a nightly routine.  I saw what appeared to be somewhat like a bright star object literally circling and stopping.  This object stopped in place then moved a little then started flying circles, then would stop.  I went in the house grabbed a flashlight with a green color bulb and flashed it off & on.  The object stopped and stayed still.  This thing must have been huge because it was like I said as bright as a star yet it was high altitude.  I would say I thought I was crazy but my girlfriend was seeing what I was seeing at the same time.  I have never in my 41 years seen any plane or even a drone be able to maneuver like this was.  I can say this was amazing! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.7181;-68.6162
