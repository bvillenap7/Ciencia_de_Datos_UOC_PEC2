Incandescent light-greenish Orb with Red Halo spotted in sky over Northern woods..................;2001-10-01 20:35:00;10 seconds;Incandescent light-greenish Orb with Red Halo spotted in sky over Northern woods.................. It appeared to have come out from the direction of the full moon, which was to my left. The oval shape was speeding somewhat rapidly down at first, and I thought initially that it was a comet, as it appeared to have a tail and it was shooting a bit down-ward, but then it went off in a very rapid parallel direction, and the comet-like trail or vapors which followed it were no more....It hovered minus the trail(s) and then appeared more roundish....the orb was incandescent green with a vibrantly bright red halo surrounding it. I know that it couldn't have been marsh gas or a flying air-craft.....at least not of any military or common sort. It absolutely was not of this planet, to my thinking....as it immediately disappeared.My eyes remained transfixed on the spot in the wooded area behind my house, but it was gone....very,very suddenly.;44.1864;-70.1461
