UFO sightings in Southern Maine;2001-08-29 22:20:00;:02;UFO sightings in Southern Maine This is the third occassion that this has happened.  Tonight I did not see any craft, but Sunday night three crafts were sighted going over the neighborhood.  They were like the ones that went over Phoenix, AZ.  Just a triangle arrangement of lights, moving very slowly.  If you were outside you couldn't hear them, but inside the house the walls were vibrating.  Tonight all I heard was the hum of them going over and it only lasted about 30 seconds or so.  I didn't get out of bed fast enough to see them.  But the sound is so unmistakable I knew what it was.;44.1864;-70.1461
