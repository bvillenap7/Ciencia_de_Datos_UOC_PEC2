I then noticed a very bright light high in the atmosphere.  Moving very quickly then turned off at a 45 degree angle and picked up speed then disappeared.  It was a clear morning with the sun shining.   There was no visible object (airplaine, or metal) it was just a bright light in the southern sky and as bright as it was it looked as if the light should have been bouncing off of whatever it was , from the north...it was super weird. No sound, just a bright light ..;44.8039;-69.8439
