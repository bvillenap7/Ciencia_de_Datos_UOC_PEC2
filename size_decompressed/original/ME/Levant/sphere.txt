Several amber spheres hovering silently;2021-03-20 20:00:00;5 minutes;Several amber spheres hovering silently Driving towards Bangor through Levant when I noticed 2 amber spheres hovering over a farm about 300 feet off the ground. Silent, did not move. I observed for 5 minutes while driving. I stopped at a store at a 4 way intersection to look at the objects. They disappeared. I continued home and observed a third object over a field on the Bangor line. This was a single orange sphere. It too dissappeared. This is a military flight path the spheres were hovering on.;44.8842;-68.9784
