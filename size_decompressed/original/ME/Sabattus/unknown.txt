My partner and I were both looking up at the night sky before going to bed for the evening, though we were on opposite sides of our house and not aware the other was doing the same thing.  We both spotted a solid white light moving very quickly high in the night sky in a straight line, I followed the light for a few moments thinking it was an airplane and impressed with its speed.  However, after a few moments as the light passed in front of a star it disappeared.   I kept searching for a moment or so for it to reappear, it didnâ€™t.  I went inside to tell my partner only to find out he had been watching it also and also thought it had been odd. We both went outside to look at the sky on the front side of the house and saw another high, fast moving white light in a similar area of the night sky though this object appeared to be moving in a slight zig zag pattern in a different direction and it also disappeared into the night sky after a few moments.  This time we also saw an airplane considerably lower in the sky with the blinking red lights on the wings and it was moving 1\10 the speed of the previous objects we had seen. I went online this morning to search for other posts hoping that someone else may have seen what we had and I ran across this site so I thought I would share my story in hopes someone else had shared the same experience.;44.1146;-70.0791
