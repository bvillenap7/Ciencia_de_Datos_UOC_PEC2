I was driving and I noticed a bright red light in the sky.  My brother saw it and at first we thought it was a plane, but didn't seem to be moving.  We kept our eyes on it for a couple minutes, then it suddenly changed color to green.  I lost sight of it once I got to a busier street.;44.1146;-70.0791
