As I was looking at the sky (Moon) i noticed something that looked like a Shooting Star. I asked my Fiancee to look at it. When she did it slowed down as it was going across the sky. Then it turned and did a figure 8 and proceeded into a circular motion.it was red then faded to white Then it turned too the left and shot strate backwards off into the distance.  Earlier this Month i was looking outside from my home and noticed a white light in the shape of a circle. I was looking at it for approxamately 5 seconds and it immediately stopped glowing and disappeared. I was a little shaken by this event but didnt think anything of it until tonight ( the second sighting) You must get a lot of these Sightings. But im telling you right now this is REAL!!! I'm a highly intelligent person. And never thought anything of this sort before, i saw these two objects. It wasnt a plane,or a shooting star. It was a outside object that i have NEVER seen have so much control if itself. It was almost like it knew that we were looking at it, and wanted to let us know and understand that it WAS there. And that it knew that we were freaked out.;44.323125;-69.7687684210526

It stayed in sight distance of our car until we got home and I ran in my house with my Mom.   It was scary, very scary...I could see it but with all the trees in Maine it was blured for maybe 5 minutes.  Then it came back into view when we got out of the car.  I felt like something was going on in the air above or around us 15 minutes before it happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Report is from young student.  PD));44.323125;-69.7687684210526
