I saw a UFO;2008-04-23 19:00:00;12 minutes;I saw a UFO   Me and my friends were walking up one of our streets. My friend turned to me and said that cloud looks like a teardrop. I said Whatever because it really did look like a teardrop, but we noticed that it kept getting closer, and then my other friend noticed small little lights on the sides of it. So suddenly it starts defusing from it's melecular cloud structure into a solid teardrop-shaped object with these blinking lights and shit started dissapearing, like leaves and even trees and rocks. So suddenly their's this giant flash, and then I just remember lying in my house naked with my two other friends. So we got up and I was all freaked out because I thought I had had a fucked up dream, and I was also naked now. So when i told my friends they had had the same dream, so We looked up UFO and Alien shit on the internet and found that you guys had a subcategory for teardrop shaped spacecrafts so I was wondering if their had been similar sightings before.
