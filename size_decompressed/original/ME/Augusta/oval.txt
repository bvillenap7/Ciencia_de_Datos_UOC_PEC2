This  evening  Monday  August 6th 2013 I was sitting  out on my cousins deck with his wife . Here in Augusta  Maine 04330  the sky was very clear stars are shining its about    930 pm  . I wonderd what stars were above us I grabbed my cell and went too  droid sky  view app. I thought it would be cool too observe the night sky and watch the sky for  a while my cousins wife was looking too . We began too see a orangish white glow in the sky about the size  of a star . We saw it travailing across the sky for a minute and a half till it was out of site over the roof of the house.  I looked at her   and said that was probably  a satelite going by . I got busy doing something else  for  about 7 minutes   I looked up  aigan    I could see another star like object moving very very quickly 2 times faster than the other object I had seen  this got my attention!!                 I  it was a star size object orangeish white ish in color I stood up turned my head too the right just be for the object went over the peek of the roof their was a burst of bright star like rays of light wich quickly imploded  intoo it self.   I yelled hey did you see that she said what I pointed it out too her this object  seemed  too last over a full minute .     The      direction of the object went from north west  too east off in the direction of Maines coastal Atlantic shores   . The object from first seeing did a fish hook turn best way for me too describe it !!!;44.323125;-69.7687684210526
