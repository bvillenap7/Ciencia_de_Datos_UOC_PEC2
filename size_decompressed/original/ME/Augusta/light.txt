It was right in town and very visible.  I thought it might be fireworkd because the lights seemed to be phasing brite and low.  My son saw them and we both remarked at the same time.  I opened the window to look out the side to make sure it was not a reflection on the windshield.  As we drove closer to the place they were over, they dissapeared.

Light moving like satellite suddenly fades out and disappears;2015-03-11 20:32:00;0.34;Light moving like satellite suddenly fades out and disappears. I was on my front porch looking up at the stars like every night looking up. I thought I saw a satelliteit.  It was moving like one.  Me and my wife are interested in looking at the stars.  so I open the door real quick and had my wife come out and look at it.  I pointed at what I thought was a satellite and it suddenly started to fade out from a white light to a dim blue light and disappear.   I want to remind you the skies are completely clear no cloud cover.;44.323125;-69.7687684210526

It was way too;2016-11-04 18:00:00;1 hour;Last night as my boyfriend and I was walking home from kmart we looked up in the sky and saw a HUGE bright white light. It was way too big to be a star.  The weird thing about it was the part of the sky it was in was clear and to the west the sky was black and red....I'm aware that it could of just been the sun setting and the biggest star I've ever seen in my life but this was seriously creepy!;44.323125;-69.7687684210526
