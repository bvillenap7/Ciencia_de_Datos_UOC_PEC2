2 large blue flashes in different locations late night in Maine;2012-09-26 00:41:00;6 seconds;2 large blue flashes in different locations late night in Maine At 12:41 P.M. ((sic.  A.M.)) my wife and I were driving home from the Portland airport on route 295 north.  About 15 minutes south of Augusta, Maine, we saw a huge blossoming, neon blue explosion, north, directly in front of us just over the horizon.  Three seconds later we saw another, a little farther to the east, toward the ocean. The color was similar to the blue flames on a propane stove.  If you held your hand out straight in front of your face and spread your fingers, they were about that size. My wife and I have seen bolides (exploding meteors) before, and these were nothing like that.  The flash came from the ground up, brighter blue at the bottom, with no streak or trail in the sky to indicate anything fell.   The rest of our trip home we did not see anything else unusual Just wanted to put this out to see if anyone else reports it.;44.323125;-69.7687684210526
