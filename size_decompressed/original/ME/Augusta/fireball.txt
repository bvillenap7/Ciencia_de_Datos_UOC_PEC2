Moving ball of flame deploys small white light in atmosphere then disipates;2012-10-08 21:30:00;~60 seconds;Moving ball of flame deploys small white light in atmosphere then disipates Myself, and two friends were walking down the street (Washington street) looked in the night sky and noticed a street light dark yellow colored object in the sky (ball of fire?). At first I thought the object was a planet but then we noticed it was much larger than a planet.  It also moved across the sky somewhat slow.  Another light (a smaller white one) detached from the object, it stayed stationary and the other object we first saw faded away like it was burning out but still travelling in the same direction. No noise could be heard from the sky, it appeared to be in the atmosphere, definitely did not appear to be a plane or satellite.  When I squinted and blocked out the street lights I almost want to say it was a V shaped craft with a rocket thruster propelling it into the atmosphere to deploy a smaller object.  That is what it looked like.;44.323125;-69.7687684210526
