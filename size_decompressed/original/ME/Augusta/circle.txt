I was looking out the patio doors when I saw what I thought was a meteor streak by and disappear over the horizon.  The only difference being when it reached the horizon it winked out of sight instantly. 2 minutes later I decided to walk out onto out deck and I noticed a bright light heading toward my position.  As I watched it approach I began filming it with my cell phone.  It was far below the orbits of any satellite, and as it grew closer the light grew brighter in intensit. We are less than a mile from the Augusta airport and there were planes doing instrument takeoffs at the time. There were no strobes or usual aircraft lights on this object. There was no sound as it passed over head and headed Northeast. I am familiar with every form of conventional aircraft having grown up an air show kid and I keep up to date on military and civilian craft that operate I this area.  The crazy thing about this is the next day two of my students who were in Winslow Maine! , which is 15 miles north northeast of Augusta told me they were outside at about 10:00 and an object passed overhead, spun around and took off.I know these kids and they wouldn't make this up. They couldn't believe what they were seeing. I also have two videos of the object. In one video you can clearly see the object as it passes. An early video I took as it first appeared shows the object winking in and out as it slowly moves across the sky. The strange thing Is as I recorded that I watched the object as it crossed the sky and I never lost sight of it. It did not wink in and out of sight. I don't know if it is because the quality of the camera or if it was due to some type of electrical interference.;44.323125;-69.7687684210526
