GREEN illuminated sphere hurling through sky;1998-11-03 20:13:00;:01;GREEN illuminated sphere hurling through sky I am a trucker traveling S. bound on the Me. turnpike approx 2 mils from the tollbooth. It is about 8:15 pm when I notice in the sky to my L. coming through the cloud cover at about 2-3thousand ft. A large perfectly shaped green sphere faintly illuminated the clouds of an area approx. 5 times it's size as it passed very quickly through the clouds at a 30degree angle toward the ground. It dissappeared behind a hill giving no evidence that it had stuck anything.This object was almost a candy green.It was not glowing. I stopped to pay my toll an asked the female toll person if she had just seen the sphere.She replied no.My guess is,it must have fallen well past the toll booth into NH;43.2565;-70.6132
