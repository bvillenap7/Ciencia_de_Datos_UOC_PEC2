Two bright lights faded over five minutes.;2006-10-14 21:30:00;5 Minutes;Two bright lights faded over five minutes. While walking the Marginal way south toward Perkins Cove, we spotted an aircraft. It passed slowly across the night sky. It was also then that we noticed a set of two stars seeming far brighter than all others. These sat rather close together, respectively. They stayed at their impossibly bright intensity for a few moments and then becan to perceptibly fade, over the course of five minutes, until no longer visible.
