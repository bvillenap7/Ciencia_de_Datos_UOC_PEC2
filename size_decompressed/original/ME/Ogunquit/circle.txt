The skys are very clear.  when I first looked up to the west, there was what seemed to be an explosion of light under 3 stars (Ithink Orion's Belt) One particularly bright pulsing circle (Ithought was a star) movedin a strabge way. I turned away to clear my eyes(in case I was seeing an illusion of some sort)  after a moment, I looked back and the star was definatly moving in a zig zag way. I watched for a moment and went in the housse to get my daughter so she coukd tell me I wasn't seeing things, but the star was gone.  Tonight about 1:30 am my husband came in from smoking a cigarette and said he saw something too.  Towards the west a zig zag moving star. I can't honestly say I saw a UFO but i am making sure my doors  and windows are locked and I am afraid to go out and look up. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius, a bright and twinkling star, is just to the left of Orion.  PD));43.2565;-70.6132
While sitting on the beach just S of the Ogunquit River outlet to the Atlantic Ocean, on July 3,2016, at approximately 2:00 - 2:30;2016-07-03 14:00:00;1 minute +;While sitting on the beach just south of the Ogunquit River outlet to the Atlantic Ocean, on July 3, 2016, at approximately 2:00 - 2:30 pm, I observed what appeared to be a sphere crossing the sky, from south to north.  It appeared to be relatively small, not shiny, you could say it was dark, and it traveled at a very constant velocity (fast, but not real fast).  There were some clouds in the sky, and I watched as this object traveled under some of the clouds, then traveled through others.  I have no idea what height the clouds were, or the altitude the object, but am positive it passed below some, and through others.  Its path was absolutely straight, and unvarying in any way.  It made absolutely no noise, created no vapor trail, was completely stealthy, with the exception of it being visible.  It was NOT a bird, or small airplane, I am ABSOLUTELY positive of this.   I regret that I have no video of this incident, all I can say is I was transfixed.  I can assure you that I was not under the influence of anything, and that no one on the beach, including my family, took notice of the object. I've mentioned the episode to my wife, and no one else. Do you have any other reports of this?  I'm not crazy, I know what I saw. Do you have any reasonable explanation for what I observed?;43.2565;-70.6132
