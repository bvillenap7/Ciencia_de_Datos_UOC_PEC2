Directly across the water, I saw a pinkish-orange ball of light in the night sky.  It was stationary/hovering and its light was reflected in the water.   At first I thought it was a planet, but it seemed too low in the sky for that.  I was a little nervous, as I had never quite seen anything like this in the night sky before.  Through my binoculars I noticed that its color was changing from orange to red and back again.   After a while I noticed that it had receded and its light trail in the water had faded, as if it was moving away from me in the exact opposite direction.  I observed this ball of light for about an hour on and off as I moved through the house.   Eventually it was gone, but it appeared to have faded into the distance rather than suddenly speeding away.   I made a few phone calls to family members regarding the experience before I filed this report.;43.7802;-69.9954
