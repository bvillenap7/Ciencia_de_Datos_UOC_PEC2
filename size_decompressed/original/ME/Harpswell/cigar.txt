I left my bedroom to walk into the llving area about 11:30 PM. The living area wall is made up of 4 glass sliders. Directly ahead in the west I saw a cigar shaped light. It hovered over an island in Quahog Bay. The stabilizer on our binoculars needed batteries, so the lights appeared to be dancing or jumping. I particularly noticed the red and orange lights. The object rose slightly and I thought it was coming closer, so I woke my husband. When he got to the living area it started to go down and disappeared behind the trees on the island. A few minutes previous to this I heard a vibrating or pulsating sound outside. It was fairly loud, so much so that I began to wonder if it was something in the house. Then it slowly faded. I spotted the object a minute or two after that.;43.7802;-69.9954
