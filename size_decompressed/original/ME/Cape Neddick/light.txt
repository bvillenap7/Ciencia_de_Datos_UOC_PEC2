Noticed 4 very distinct orange/red lights flying out above Cape Neddick Beach.;2014-07-18 21:11:00;55 minutes;Noticed 4 very distinct orange/red lights flying out above Cape Neddick Beach.   They seemed like aircraft at first but then began changing their flight patterns and moving in non-linear motions.   Lights would get bright then fade.   At one point they all disappeared and then 2 returned.   Seemed to be following the shoreline back and forth as if looking for something.   Finally, after almost 55 mins, the lights disappeared.
