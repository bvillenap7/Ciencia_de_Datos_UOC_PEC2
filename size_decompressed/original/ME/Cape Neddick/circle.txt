Ocean-bound low-flying saucer glimpsed in Maine;2010-03-06 23:30:00;.4 sec;Ocean-bound low-flying saucer glimpsed in Maine I was parked outside a buddies apartment building the other night, gazing out the front windshield of my car I glimpsed somthing move overhead and behind some trees and buildings.  It obscured the stars behind it in a circular form, and had what appeared to be two lights on either side, it moved swiftly and silently, and appeared to be flying very low. I moved my head and checked lighting inside the car to confirm it was not a reflection on the glass (it wasn't).  The object was headed towards the ocean.;43.2124;-70.6366
