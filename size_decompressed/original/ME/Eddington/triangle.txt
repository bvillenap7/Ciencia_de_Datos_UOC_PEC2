Triangular shaped UFO with blue lights hovering above field off of Route 46 in Eddington, Maine.;1996-06-10 01:00:00;4 minutes;Triangular shaped UFO with blue lights hovering above field off of Route 46 in Eddington, Maine. At about 1:00 am I was driving home on Route 46 from my friend's house in Brewer when I saw a bright object in the sky out of the corner of my left eye.  We live out of the city, in a more rural, mountainous area.  The overseas flights from Bangor International Airport fly overhead and from my home we see/hear them passing above daily.  My first thought was that this was a late, redeye flight but the plane moved too quickly across the sky. I was about 1+ mile from the Hatcase Pond Road (formerly the South Road).  As I ascended the crest of a steep hill in the road this plane went zooming overhead.  I sped the car up trying to see out the front and passenger window in the direction that it was heading and I didn't see anything.  I then drove faster to the next field/clearing on the right (about a quarter to .5 miles further)to see it and instead of being far away it was slowly flying over the field.  This scared me so I drove faster towards home, still looking to the right above the tree line and was shocked to see that the UFO was hovering above the clearing at the end of the South Road (another .5 mile or so away).  I slammed on the brakes and was mesmerized by the shape and lights.  I could see it completely as I leaned over the passenger seat of my car and looked out the window.  It was triangular shaped and appeared black against the night sky except for blue circular lights which seemed to line the edge of the ship.  After probably only 30 seconds to a minute, I sped the car up,driving at breakneck speed to get home.  I did not see the UFO again.;44.7883;-68.587
