Large metalic cigar shaped object seen just before sunset.;2013-05-19 18:30:00;1 minute;Large metalic cigar shaped object seen just before sunset. My 10 year old son and I were out for a walk and we saw a large metalic cigar shaped craft fly in front of the moon.  The light from the moon illuminated the craft very well.   The craft had no wings, tailing or lights.  The object made no noise and did not emit a contrail.  It was visible for less than a minute before it was gone from our view.   In contrast about 10 minutes later a passenger  jet also flew over heading in the same direction and I could hear it, and I could see the red mmarkings on it, as well as the wings and lights.;44.7883;-68.587
