dark circle dim lights from above showed shape stopped in it's path when we spotted it took 90% turn quick stopped turned parrellel too;1973-06-01 19:00:00;1 minute;dark circle dim lights from above showed shape stopped in it's path when we spotted it took 90% turn quick stopped turned parrellel took off fast seconds later 2nd zoomed past ridiculed by local paper round black circle night sky illuminated only by dim light around it. Flying high in night sky,no noise,going slow,I now believe it was observing us playing in snow[sliding].As we seen it ,it stopped dead in it's tracks took quick 90% turn sped quick stopped dead again took off very fast parallel to origional flight path seconds later 2nd craft sped by seemingly in original path of first. We hollered to other friend in house,whom called immediately local paper as if he had seen it,but truthfully he hadn't they ridiculed us in local paper describing it like an airplane[which it was not!]My brother who was one of the witnesses is now deceased but I wouldn't lie in behalf of his name,the second witness is now a civil engineer and his brother who made the call to local paper now works the pentagon. the second craft I could not say really if it was alike or maybe one of ours checking out what we seen,but at it's rate of speed I don't believe so I was in USAF,seen a lot of air shows and I believe second to be same but couldn't detect shape as for speed and height in sky;44.7883;-68.587
