Day Light Disk;2005-07-24 05:50:00;10 seconds;Day Light Disk I was heasding east on 295 into Brunswick when I saw the disk heading north just below the clouds. It seemed to be reflecting the sunlight but because of it's location to the cloud and the time of day I realized that would be imposible.  It was traveling at a high rate of speed and I lost track of it while I was driving.  I'm chosing to to identify myself because of my affiliation with the Defense Department.
