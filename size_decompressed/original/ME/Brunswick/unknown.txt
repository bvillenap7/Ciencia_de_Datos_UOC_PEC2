Completely filled the interior of the aircraft.   To aircrew inquiry, tower reported no other aircraft using the field that night.  My source for this sighting is ((name and rank deleted)), a veteran P-3 naval flight ((position deleted)) who was the ((title deleted)) onboard the aircraft in question.  He was ((deleted)) at another command at Brunswick. Very reputable ((rank deleted) with a TS clearance. This event clearly spooked him.  The lights were seen by other witnesses later that morning in Portland.  Reported in local newspapers.  Not quite sure of the date. I have filled this page out several times, but have problems filing the report.  Call for more details. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));43.8971;-69.9817

Tonight however I saw something extremely weird.  3 UFO's that where flying hoovering about 1000 ft up. They had 6 flashing lights, RED, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, ORANGE, AND WHITE.  I don't know what they were unless they are a new type of airplane or jet, but there was absolutly ZERO SOUND COMING FROM ANY OF THEM.  So, tell me if you know what in God's Green Earth they are. Thanks.;43.8971;-69.9817
Two slow moving, then hovering, objects in night sky.;2016-06-14 21:00:00;20 minutes;Two slow moving, then hovering, objects in night sky. 9pm – We were in our back yard, looking up at the Moon, when we noticed two “aircraft lights” a little “west” of the  moon, about the height that we usually see airplanes.  Planes regularly fly over our house, at a high altitude we see the lights blinking and sometimes a red light from the taillight.  My husband said that’s weird the lights on those planes aren’t blinking.  I was like oh ok who cares.  Then he was like also one of them isn’t moving, they are just hovering.  Then we thought helicopter??  But it seemed really high for a helicopter and we couldn’t hear anything, we can usually hear a faint roar when a plane flies over.   So then one of the “lights” starts moving really slowly through the clouds heading east, while the other stayed still.  An actual plane flew by as this was happening, the plane was much faster with blinking lights and we could hear it.   The east light moved for about 5-6 minutes then stopped and hovered.  The west light started moving really slowly as well, for about 2 minutes then stopped.   They both just stayed there, seemingly equidistant from the moon (from what we could tell) for about 20 minutes before a large black storm cloud obscured them from view.;43.8971;-69.9817
