Flashing red, blue lights around stat. obj. w/ white lights: seen Nov, 5, 6, & 8 in W sky of ME. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD));2011-11-08 21:00:00;5 mins;Flashing red, blue lights around stationary object with white lights: seen Nov, 5, 6, & 8 in western sky of Maine. My wife and I witnessed an object on Nov. 8, 2011, in the western sky that appeared to be stationary.  It glowed and had flashing red and blue lights that flashed (or strobe) around the object in a CCW manner.  White lights were also around the object, but these didnâ€˜t seem to be flashing. The object could have been cylindrical in shape but could have been V-shaped.  This object was not a plane or helicopter as it did not appear to move much as witnessed to be in the same general location several hours later.  Possibly the rotation of the earth could make it appear to move slowly down in the western sky as time passed. We originally thought it may be the ISS or a satellite but this appeared to be larger and/or closer to us.  This object was also seen for several nights before we both saw it.   What is this??
