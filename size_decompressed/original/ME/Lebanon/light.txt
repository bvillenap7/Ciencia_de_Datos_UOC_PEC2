It’s unknown as to how many there were, there was not enough time to count before they disappeared behind the cover of trees.  I would say it was at least 15 of these lights moving in a tight single file line all close together except for 3 in the back that were farther back and more spread out than the others.  However they all appeared to be in a straight line moving the same direction.  Unfortunately my phone was dead but I don’t believe it would have been able to capture it without a better lens anyway.  I’ve never seen anything like this, especially in Maine, but I could not find a reasonable explanation as to what could cause this. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));43.4621;-70.9149
