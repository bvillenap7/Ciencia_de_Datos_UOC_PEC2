Then saw six others come out of the clouds not in any pattern.  They were larger than any stars, three times the size approximately.   They were  orangish and red and looked like light and were round in form.  They moved very slowly and were headed East to West.   I called my daughter, she was driving ahead of me on the road, then pulled over with two other cars.  I got out and went to talk with the people in front of me.   They did not know what they were either and we could hear nothing.   I was very scared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found her to be an exceptionally well-spoken person.  We suspect that she is an quite capable, and credible, witness.
