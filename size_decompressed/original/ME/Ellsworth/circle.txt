Branch Lake UFO sightings. Circular crafts, with white flashing lights.;2013-08-20 07:50:00;30 minutes;Branch Lake UFO sightings. Circular crafts, with white flashing lights. Branch Lake sighting.  My two friends and I were out on our camp dock. We had seen a circular light flashing object over by the trees, for about 30 minutes.  It disappeared into the trees suddenly.  We kept watching after it disappeared.  We saw another one across the lake.  At first we thought it was a plane. I said, If this is a plane, it will keep going, if it stops at the same place…  We know what it is.   It did.  It stopped at the exact place the other one disappeared.  Then, It came bolting at us. We ran inside, and went back out about 15 minutes later.  There was another figure floating above the camp.  It was circular like the others, and had the same flashing lights.;44.5547999999999;-68.4120999999997
Circular object with blue/ subtle red lights blinking sat in one spot for half hour;2015-04-04 20:00:00;30 minutes;Circular object with blue/subtle red lights blinking sat in one spot for half hour. It was circular and had blue and subtle red lights blinking and looked like it had a vague white light coming from the bottom not very noticeable..  I watched this for a half an hour realizing it was not moving there was not way it could be a plane, planes dont just stay in one spot.  I took video of it also..i looked down to find my phone charger when i looked back up it was gone.;44.5547999999999;-68.4120999999997
Small Circular Orange in color moving up, down, left, right switching between slow and quickly actions.;2020-08-26 00:13:00;1 hour and counting;Small Circular Orange in color moving up, down, left, right switching between slow and quickly actions. Object is orange is round like a star but much bigger and is moving up down left and right and all those other directions in a small pattern sometimes zipping up and down but stays within a certain perimeter and constantly changes direction and speed but all within a small area, have multiple videos unfortunately they’re not very clear. This is not the first time a UFO has been spotted at our property on branch lake, this is the only sighting caught on video, I would like to upload my videos. They are around 1min30sec taken on a IPhone 10. Has also appeared to stop and stay stationary for a few moments then starts moving around again. Videos and pictures DONOT give this sighting any justice but it is without doubt a UFO. I would like to send you my videos and would like to know where to send them???;44.5547999999999;-68.4120999999997
