(Light was briefly white, then turned light and very bright green.)  The light was accompanied by a loud, vibrating pulse that lasted 4-5 seconds.  After about 10-15 seconds, the light and pulse repeated exactly as the first time.  Fog and darkness did not allow us to see into the sky.;44.5547999999999;-68.4120999999997
