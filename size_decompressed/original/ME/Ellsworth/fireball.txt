4 Orange Spheres flying in diamond formation.;2012-12-31 23:20:00;2 minutes;4 Orange Spheres flying in diamond formation Tonight while driving my coworker back to the restaurant we saw, what looked like, 3 orange spheres moving slowly in the sky.  They were flying in a triangular formation, as we were loosing sight of the lead object, we noticed a 4th orange ball bringing up the rear to make what looked like a diamond formation.  The fireballs were moving from right to left heading North East. Never seen anything like it, very strange.
