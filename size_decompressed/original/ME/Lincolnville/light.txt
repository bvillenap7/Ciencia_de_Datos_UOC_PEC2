Half-hour long string of starlike orbs, one changed direction.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-03 03:00:00;1.5 hours;Half-hour long string of starlike orbs, one changed direction. At approximately 4am on 5/3/2020 at Bald Rock Summit, myself and three others witnessed a string of starlike objects travel for nearly half an hour from the south west towards the eastern horizon over the ocean.  The objects look like a satellite as it would appear in the the night sky.  They were mostly equidistant in spacing.  However, we all witnessed one of the orbs break off from the line and make a curving trajectory change towards the north, changing its heading by approx. 90 degrees.  The lights seemed to materialize and appear in the same spot of clear sky towards the South West approx every ten or fifteen seconds.   The sighting lasted for about half an hour, until 4:30 during this time dozens of orbs were witnessed.  Myself and three others also witnessed a very similar string of lights travel from West to East from the Summit of Mount Battie on 4/19/2020 from approximately 9:00pm to 9:40pm.  Prior to seeing the string of lights on 5/3/2020, we witnessed a reddish-whitish light flashing in an irregular manner towards the east over the ocean.  It flashed on and off every few minutes about thirty degrees above the eastern horizon.  This lasted for close to an hour before witnessing the string of orbs.;44.3016;-69.0788
