Object seemed close and possibly half the size of a full moon. Was very bright, blueish white in color,brighter than a full moon. Both my wife and myself saw this glowing ball of light on the same evening from different locations (approx 1 mile apart).  There wasn't a sound accompanying this objects travel, though seemed to be very close as it moved overhead. At first I thought it was a shooting star but it was moving slower and was much larger than any  falling star or meteor.  It also moved accros the night sky not plummeting downward. My wife saw the object moving in a North/NorthEast direction overhead, from the outside porch of our house.  I was driving roughly in the same direction as the object when I spotted it overhead and in front of me. On my returning home minutes later, we were surprised the we'd seen the same weird thing. One more point of interest, on Saturday the 2nd, we had three sonic booms and the sound of more than one aircraft after each boom.;44.7849;-69.9345
