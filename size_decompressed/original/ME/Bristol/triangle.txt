Blueish/Green shimmery lights on a triangle craft.;2018-08-17 21:30:00;10 seconds;Blueish/Green shimmery lights on a triangle craft Driving up Route 130 in from New Harbor.  Noticed blue light behind the trees to my left, and when I crested the hill looked out my driver's side window.  First noticed the blueish/green shimmery lights, one on each corner of a completely black triangle craft.   Guessing 300-500 feet up, maybe moving slowly south.   Had to second guess I wasn’t seeing some sort of towers, but there weren’t any around.;43.9519;-69.4956
