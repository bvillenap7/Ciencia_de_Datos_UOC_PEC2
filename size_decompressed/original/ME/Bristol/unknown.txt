((anonymous report));2020-01-01 01:00:00;60;See clouds looked weird and only 2 in sky then sun reflection of my mirror from sun setting hit this ship,, was directly above me and I screamed and pointed and it shot up and sat for min until taking 90 degree angle at speed so fast it left the blue sky a trail ! It was studying me and friend ice fishing on lake in pickup ! Had hair raising feeling something watching and sure enough it was 80 ft above me and 50 -60 ft around and Chamaeleon camo until sun reflection showed it true form , that same area my father and his 2 friends chased a craft exactly same thing 20 years ago to the tee and town watched it as they chased it on atvs over trees !;43.9519;-69.4956
