A large orange ball...larger than any stars that changed to red and green with a bright light in the center..it hovered for a while and slowly went down like the sun on the horizon...as it went down it became a darker orange and with bonoculars you could see a faint light following behind kinda like a tail. We at first thought it was a comet but it became more and more an unfamiliar object. it lasted about 10 minutes than flicker out.;44.0474;-70.3899
Meteor streaks from Newgloucster, over Poland towards Oxford. (Maine);2008-12-29 21:29:00;3 Seconds;Meteor streaks from Newgloucster, over Poland towards Oxford. (Maine) I was driving past Tripp Lake Beach in Poland maine towards Raymond. A streak of green, blue and yellow passed overhead from east to west.  It was low, too low to be a shooting star but was more of a falling star.  Its direction of travel put it headed towards Oxford.  While I didn't hear it hit because I was in my car with the radio on, I pulled over to see if i could still see it.  That's when i kept hearing small pops (Possibly explosions) in the extreme distance over the course of the next twenty or so minutes.  After getting and posting online that i had seen it, two of my friends also told me they had seen it as well.  They agreed it was so low that it had to have come down relatively close by.  One had seen it in New Gloucster, and the other more near Oxford. ((NUFORC Note:  We would welcome other reports.  PD));44.0474;-70.3899
