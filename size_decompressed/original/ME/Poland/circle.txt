Bright white ball in the sky that stopped and changed direction 90 degrees, airplanes cant do that.;2011-08-01 04:30:00;5 minutes;a bright white ball in the sky that stopped and changed direction 90 degrees, airplanes cant do that It was in august of 2011at 4:30 am myself and four other people had just ended our shift at work, it was a clear night sky. We were standing around talking, and a bright white light in the sky caught our attention. The shape of the light was round.  We tared at it for a minute and then it took off from south west and proceded toward the north west.  There were no flashing lights on it like an airplane has, it moved in a straight line thru the sky.  It stoppd abrupty for a few seconds, then went north, stopped again and then stopped again.  It then took off in the north east direction again.  This object went at least twenty five miles and two counties in less than three minutes, it then stopped again and stayed there for at least a half hour.  The sky was dark and it was an hour and a half before the sun was to rise.  There was no planes in the sky because our airports close from midnight until six am.  The five of us were speachless.  Never had we seen anything that can stop and change direction like that before.we live in maine and we know what a shooting star looks like and this was not a star but a ufo....
