Thunderous noise with zooming red and yellow lights.;2017-03-24 03:15:00;3 minutes;Thunderous noise with zooming red and yellow lights. There was raucous thunder, and I didn't think anything of it at first, until the sound went away and came back.  Then I got worried.   I looked out my bedroom window and two crafts were zooming through the sky.  They were each formed by two lights:  red and yellow.  It was a constant light, not blinking or flashing like you see on normal planes.   I thought at first a plane was crashing.  One craft looked like it was falling rapidly in the air, but then another circled it--not touching, just around it--and then they soared off.  This was quick.   I reached for my phone to make a video, but it was over in seconds!  From when it first woke me, to when they flew off, I'd say it lasted 3 minutes tops.;44.7258;-68.7831
