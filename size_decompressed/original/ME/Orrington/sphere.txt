On 10/23/12 at aprox 2300 in Orrington, Maine, NNE @ aprox 11 o'clock I witnessed a large high altitude sphere bluish in hue. It became very bright, much more so than venus or anything other than the moon.   The sphere would then fade until it was barely visable then it would appear to move about in a circular pattern fading until it was almost out of sight.   The sphere would then get brighter and brighter until it would again be brighter than anything in the sky, rivaling the moon.  It would repeat this sequence over and over for about an hour until clouds overtook my area. It appeared to be very high in the atmosphere, there was no noise.  It was very unnerving to say the least.;44.7258;-68.7831
