20 plus amber colored objects in formation over Orrington;2013-07-28 22:20:00;5-10 minutes;20 plus amber colored objects in formation over Orrington It began around 10:15 pm when our cat started asking to go out.  I finally gave in and let him out onto the deck where he started to growl as he looked up toward the sky.  I did not see anything at first and then I noticed several objects in the sky come from the southeast then turn almost due north.  Each object was amber in color and made up of 3 circles.  There were 4 of these objects in formation and they were silent.  I called to my wife to take a look and she saw them as well.  I’m a pilot and thought at first that it might be some military exercise as we are near the Bangor airport.  But what struck me as strange was that these objects had no navigation lights, were totally silent, and kept coming in groups of 4.  It was difficult to estimate the altitude or speed but I would say that they were possibly less 1,000 feet AGL.  They moved at a constant speed, not fast or slow.  We observed 20-24 of these objects and they all followed the same path from the southeast turning northerly.  A few minutes after the last group passed, our cat calmed down and came in and slept quietly the rest of the night.  It’s almost as though he sensed something unusual.  Unfortunately, we did not think to take any photos.;44.7258;-68.7831
