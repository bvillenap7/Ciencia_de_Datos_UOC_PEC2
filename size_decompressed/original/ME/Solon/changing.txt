High elevation when seen from my computer.Did it Land? I am at my computer again and on the distant Horizon it appears red. Instantly it propels itself forward like a big flash of white light and disappears. Unaware if it ventured behind a ridge or landed as I am at a high elevation with a wide Western View  I have seen it prior and after my report issued here on 2/ 29/ 20 and called in a Close encounter the same am of the 29th. Monday as I was telling someone what had happened a young man with his son stated he had seen the same sighting .Wasn't certain if it was on the 29th but had a Video of it. If investigated he will be here with me also.Thank you, Beverly;44.9694;-69.8356
