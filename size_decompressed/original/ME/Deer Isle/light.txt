Large ball of light, streaking south to north, over Deer Isle, Maine.;2009-09-20 18:00:00;2 seconds;Large ball of light, streaking south to north, over Deer Isle, Maine. We were out on the deck in North Deer Isle, it was still daylight, and I saw a ball of light going from south to north.  It was too fast for an aircraft and seemed to arc like it was following the horizon.  My guess was it was a meteor but I've been googling this event and no one else seems to have seen it. I have seen falling stars before but this didn't seem to look like that, as it was a larger ball of light and seemed closer than a falling star.  I, too, am a skeptic about sightings, and 3 other people were out there with me, but none of them saw it.  I was telling a story and stopped, mid sentence, and stared at it as it flew by, but by the time my friends looked up where I was looking it was gone, as it only lasted MAYBE 2 seconds at the most.
