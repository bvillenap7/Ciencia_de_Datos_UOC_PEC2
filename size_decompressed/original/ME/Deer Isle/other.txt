Orbs with auras moving north and a triangle shaped object moving over 30 + foot trees.;2005-04-26 21:30:00;30 - 45 minutes;Orbs with auras moving north and a triangle shaped object moving over 30 + foot trees. My sister, nephew, and I witnessed multiple orbs with a green aura around the largest one. The aura appeared to be the wash from the rotors of silent helicopters flying north over Deer Isle at an elevation of 10 miles up or more.  We started to view thru a telescope, but quickly realized it was easily seen with the naked eye.  The orb and wash effect moved in various directions only to return to the initiation point.  After watching for some 45 minutes a large triangle shaped object passed over our home moving west to east. It was silent as it floated over the 30 + foot trees that ring our summer home.  It disappeared in the blink of an eye and the previously seen wash disappeared also.  The sky was studded with stars that appears to be out of their normal position. My sister saw what she believes was recon aircraft coming from the north.;44.2332;-68.6438
