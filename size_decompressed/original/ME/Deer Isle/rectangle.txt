Several non man made objects in the northeastern sky flashing bright green blue and red lights.... ((NUFORC Note:  Stars??  PD));2013-11-03 19:00:00;1 hour;several non man made objects in the northeastern sky flashing bright green blue and red lights.... My wife was watching the night sky and came inside to ask me to look at the stars.  I went out side and observed several objects flickering in the distant sky.   We obtained binoculars and observed several objects with very sharp and crisp lights, red green and blue.  Darting around with incredible speed.  The shape was hard to determine due to distance and the erratic movement. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been looking at the star, Capella.  PD));44.2332;-68.6438
