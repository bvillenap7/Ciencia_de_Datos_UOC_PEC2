Bright light flashes in sky follwed by a flying disk in Gorham,Me.;2012-01-28 22:00:00;25 SECONDS;Bright light flashes in sky follwed by a flying disk in Gorham,Me. I am a 38yr old female from Gorham, Me.   My fiancé and I were driving down Westcott Road in Gorham, Me. which has hay fields on both sides of the road, at approximately 10:00p when we both saw a flash or trail of bright light in the sky and a disk shape fly quickly in the sky and he stopped the truck and with in seconds a second one shot through the sky right behind the first.   We both looked at each other in disbelief and I said, Ddid you just see what I just saw?!!! It wasn’t a shooting star, as the disk and light was clearly visible and the trail of light was larger than a shooting star could possibly be.

UFO lingering low in the sky the chased off by other aircraft.;2015-08-28 23:00:00;10 minutes;UFO lingering low in the sky the chased off by other aircrafts Two of my family members where outside talking on the porch as I was inside, they both notice this large disk shaped thing and yell my name (as they know I am a alien fanatic).   I come running out of the house and I spot it immediately, I walk out into my yard and that's when it started moving towards me.  My family had said that before I had come outside that it was still and stayed in one place.   As it moved forward it became very close, it was not high up in the sky at all.  You could see every edge on it, the center where there was a large white light and all the other light around the center.   You could hear it as it went above me, and look right up into it.   It did not go by fast and seemed to linger.   Soon enough we hear police sirens and other airplanes come towards our location.   Then the UFO was gone.
