Metalic object spotted, dissapears.;2013-09-10 16:46:00;15 seconds;Metalic object spotted, dissapears. While driving, I witnessed a metallic object, cylindrical with stout crosspiece (also cylindrical?) hovering in sky above the Grondin Quarry.  It was quite high in the sky.  A tree interrupted my view for a brief instant.  I continued to watch it as I turned onto another road.  A second tree interrupted my view, and then it was gone.  No sound, sign of movement (trail) remained.;43.6819999999999;-70.4694
