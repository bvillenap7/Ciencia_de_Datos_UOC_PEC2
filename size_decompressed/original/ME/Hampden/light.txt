bright spot of light;2004-10-24 16:00:00;45 seconds;bright spot of light was driving home from going to Walmart in Brewer Maine on I-395. The object was coming from the east I was going south, it lasted about 45 seconds and then disappeared withouit a trace. I guess it could have been a a spot light or a landing light from a plane, but I don't know what a plane would be doing with it's landing or spot light on at that time of day. It was overcast but not foggy and under the clouds it was clear and not raining.;44.7375;-68.8782000000001
A bright light in the treeline;2009-10-03 03:30:00;2 Minutes;A bright light in the treeline It was around 3:30 am when I let my dog out to go to the bathroom.  I was standing in the door way looking out into our back yard which is just a giant open empty field with a few clumps of trees and I saw a light in the tree line that I thought was a four wheeler.  Basically I the only way it could have been a four wheeler or ATV would be if it was hanging in the tree.  I screamed for my boyfriend to come out of the bedroom to check it out and when he did he took one look at whatever this was ran out to grab the dog and ran back inside.  We both stood there and blinked to try and make sense of what we were seeing.  The light got brighter and bigger and was just in one spot for a minute or two. I got freaked out and ran into the bedroom and hid under the covers.  My boyfriend stood there and said that after the light became really bright it quickly shot up into the air till he couldn't see it any longer.  I was scared for the rest of the night and every noise I hea! rd made me even more scared.  I almost jumped into the car to go stay at a hotel.  And just so you know I don't believe in things unless I can see them with my own eyes and this made me a believer in something.
