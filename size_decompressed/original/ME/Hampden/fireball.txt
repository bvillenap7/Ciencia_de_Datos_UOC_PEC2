The object moved at a slow rate and hovered I was driving home when I saw a bright orb in the sky.  It resembled a star or planet however it was a little bigger.  It had a very bright yellowish/orange glow which gave it an oval like shape.   At first I thought it might be a plane with its bright landing lights or a helicopter with a spotlight or something.  The object then appeared to drop in altitude towards the ground but not at a fast rate.  It actually was moving at a slower rate than an airplane typically seems to travel.   At first, when it began to drop in altitude, I thought a plane or something was on fire and falling towards the Earth due to the intense brightness.  It then leveled off just above the treeline.   All this happened while I was driving.   I pulled into my driveway and got out of my car to see if I could hear a plane or helicopter, but I heard nothing.  I ran inside to call my girlfriend to tell her about what I saw.   I went back outside and could see the glow just through the top of the tree line.  It appeared to be hovering.   I went back inside to get my camera but the battery was dead.  I then went outside one last time, but it was gone.;44.7375;-68.8782000000001
