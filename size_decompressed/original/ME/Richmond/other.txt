Lights in sky, hoovering like object over house.  ((NUFORC Note:;2011-03-31 20:00:00;15 min;Lights in sky, hoovering like object over house We were driving home from town and saw 2 lights in the sky very bright lights, I thought it was maybe one of the towers for the Airport in Augusta but wondered why I had never seen it before.  There was a big light on the top and directly under it was a smaller one they were perfectly aligned up and down.  We watched there were 3 in our car, it didn't move as we moved closer it stayed still in the sky.   We drove for about 5 minutes watching and we were going to follow the light to see what it was, when we turned away for a second because of the trees the one disappeared the one that was on top, the little one started to move we ended up pulling in our driveway and our kids pulled in behind us we all got out   I was just in awe as this craft or whatever it was went directly over us, no sound just lights it looked like a hoovering car, it had a flat bottom with one light on each side.   It disappeared when we turned to watch.;44.1027;-69.8255
