String of lights heading Southwest to Northeast.   ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD))  ((anonymous source));2019-05-26 22:00:00;>5 minutes;String of lights heading Southwest to Northeast. Heading Southwest to Northeast at 10 PM EST just past the last star in the Big Dipper's handle, I saw a string of 30-50 equidistant lights moving at the same speed with varying brightness (most remaining the same brightness of a typical satellite, while some were about the brightness of Venus and some brightening and dimming like an Iridium flare). They disappeared at the treeline (about an arms length relative to my view). Starlink satellites, maybe? ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.
