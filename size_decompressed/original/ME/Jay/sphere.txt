On my way to work on June 22 (night shift), I noticed a bright object in my peripheral vision.  No stars really visible at this time as the sun was just starting to go down.  Upon closer examination with my iPhone camera, I noticed the object seamed to move, in place. Hard to explain, but the video may help clear it up some.  Weirdly shortly after video recording the incident,  I had seen on social media and a few other sites that I use to research the topic that several witnesses in other states we baffled by bright spherical objects high in the sky.  I read that several comments were claiming it to be a ufo, while, some skeptics of the ufo topic said “case closed” it’s a high altitude balloon released by google.  And apparently  that wasn’t the case because it’s my understanding that google actually commented on the post in reply stating they do have high altitude balloons, but do not have any released in the Atmosphere as of the comment.  Strange, I believe I may have witnessed what several others from various states had seen.;44.516;-70.2099
