Greyish sphere seen by 2 people in Maine.;2012-10-21 05:30:00;15 seconds;Greyish sphere seen by 2 people in Maine. While watching the Orionid Meteor shower we observed what appeared to be a greyish ball shaped object traveling from West to East on a straight trajectory.  I asked my girlfriend if she saw it and she replied yes.  We both wondered what it might be.  It had no obvious light emitting from it, but was still visible as grey in the night sky.  We did not observe it from horizon to horizon, but watched it travel about 1/4 of the night sky.  The sky was clear in our location with some slight clouds low on our southerly horizon.;44.2537;-70.2468

Two red glowing orbs very slowly traveling about 25-35 degrees above southern horizon, east to west.   Object on left would dissapear at random for a few seconds, then reappear in the approximately the same place. Eventually we lost site of them.;44.2537;-70.2468
