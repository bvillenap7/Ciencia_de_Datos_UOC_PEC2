Very bright and changing colr very clear red , blue and white.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius.  PD));2012-11-17 23:00:00;3 hours;Very bright and changing colr very clear red , blue and white While looking in the sky I noticed a bright oval with alternating red, blue, and white lights a little above the tree line, east of my location. Towards Wayne I asked my wife to come and look at this object in the sky? At first it looked closer and slowly moved up, and moving from side to side. We watched this object for a while going sideways and up out only to watch it move, while staying in the same vicinity. You can clearly see blue, red, and a white color, Very bright and still in the same vicinity after two and a half hours.  My daughter came out, and kept asking me what that could be, and thatâ€™s what prompted me to write this and hopefully find out or at least have someone else say they saw the same thing.

Oval shaped object with bright yellow lights.;2018-02-06 16:30:00;1:00 minute;Oval shaped object with bright yellow lights. Saw a oval object with 3 very bright round yellow lights.  This object was about above trees in an area that also has fields.  Was right at dusk, but still light out.  It hovered motionless until I lost it behind the trees as I was traveling in my vehicle.   Was so bright that others on the road had to have seen it as there was very heavy traffic at the time.;44.2537;-70.2468
