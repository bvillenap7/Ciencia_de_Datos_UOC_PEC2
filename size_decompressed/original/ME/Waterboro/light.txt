I am wondering if there are any others in the area that have seen or reported the same things. I would like it if my old friend Peter Davenport would call me and i could tell him the details directly. I used to be a Field Investigator and State Section Director for York County Maine MUFON. My interest in this field is because i have been having unusual forms of contact all my life and still have sightings occasionally.  I know what to look for and this was no doubt, the real thing.... i have 2 witnesses this time...not always been the case....:) Hope to hear from Peter, it has been awhile... BTW, he loved my Investigative reports...he will remember me...i also met him twice while visiting Seattle, about 8 years ago. Thank you, ((name deleted)) Sundays is a good time to call me at work: 207-((number deleted)) (Name of business deleted)), Portland, ME.);43.5629;-70.7397
