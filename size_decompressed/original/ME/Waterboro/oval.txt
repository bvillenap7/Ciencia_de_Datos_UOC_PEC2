PD))  2 BRIGHT LIGHTS OVERHEAD ONE EMITTING 3 RAYS OF LIGHT;2005-04-29 21:45:00;10 minutes;2 BRIGHT LIGHTS OVERHEAD ONE EMITTING 3 RAYS OF LIGHT AND THEN A CIRCLE OF LIGHT AROUND IT PASSING WEST TO EAST AT  A HIGH ALITIUDE A SATELITE LOOKING OBJECT SOMEWHAT BRIGHTER ,TRAVELING WEST TO EAST AT THE APPARENT ALTITUDE OF A SATELITE SUDDENLY EMITTED A STREAM OF MISTY LIGHT OUT OF BOTH SIDES TOWARD THE REAR OF THE OBJECT, AND SHORTLY AFTER A MISTY LIGHT OUT OF THE FRONT OF IT IN THE DIRECTION OF ITS TRAVEL. THESE 3 LIGHTS CONTINUED FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS AND WENT OUT, THEN THE OBJECT WAS ENCIRCLED WITH A WHITE MISTY LIGHT CONTINUING ON ITS WAY TOWARD THE HORIZON. A SECOND OBJECT APPEARED OVERHEAD TRAVELING THE SAME ALTITUDE AND DIRECTION ABOUT 5 MILES BEHIND SHOWING NOTHING UNUSAL BUT APPEARED TO SLOW AND SPEED UP. BOTH OBECTS CONTINUED OVER THE HORIZON AND BEFORE THEY DISSAPEARED,2 COMMERICAL FLIGHTS PASSED ONE AT DEPARTING ALTITUDE AND THE OTHER ON 30 MILE APPROACH FINAL ALTITUDE. MY HOME IS 30 MILES FROM PORTLAND MAINE AIRPORT WHERE I WORK FOR THE F.A.A. AS A TECHICIAN. I SEE ARRIVALS AND DEPARTURES OVER MY HOUSE ALL THE TIME. I WONDER IF THE PILOTS WOULD HAVE NOTICED THE OBJECTS? EVEN THOUGH THE OBJECTS WERE AT THE ALTITUDE THAT THE SATELITES TRAVEL. IT WAS A CLEAR STARLITE NIGHT.HAS ANYONE EVER REPORTED ANY SUC OBECTS BEFORE? ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs. (Eastern) on this date.  The missile apparently was launched to the northeast, so it was visible along the eastern shoreline of the U. S..  PD));43.5629;-70.7397
