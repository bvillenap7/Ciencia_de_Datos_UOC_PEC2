Red tipped UFO over RT 35 in Harrison, Maine;2010-11-12 18:30:00;5 mins;Red tipped UFO over RT 35 in Harrison, Maine Driving home at 6:30pm on 11/12/2010, driving into Harrison, Maine on RT 35. Just passed Buck RD. on the right. Over a line of pine trees was a bright red 3 to 4 tipped object hovering just above the tree line and seemed to hover. As I drove closer to it it disappeared behind the tree line. I was alone in the car but on the phone with my Husband who I reported it to. It really spooked me. I knew it wasn't an airplane or helicopter, no sound, I turned off the radio and rolled the window down, no sound. I continued along RT 35 and could not see anything else? Definitely some kind of UFO.I just can't stop thinking about it.

Red tipped UFO Triangular shape/diamond shape.;2010-11-12 18:30:00;5 minutes;Red tipped UFO Triangular shape/diamond shape addendum:  It came across the sky hovering from Shawnee Peak heading NE direction.  I was driving and noticed it from my left looking out the window.  I saw three or four red lights, seemingly intact, flying and or hovering heading ahead of me NE toward Rt 35 in Harrison.  The craft did not have ANY noise, at all. In fact, when the craft hovered over the line of pine trees, no wind or movement disrupted the trees, no windy swaying at all. The lights we bright red, but not bright by our means. It was a bright red like shining a light through opaque red jello.  They were chevron shaped, I was that close to it.  It only illuminated what was directly underneath the lights.  I was awe struck and then felt immediate petrifying fear when the craft descended into the pines and the lights went out.  I assume it landed when the light went out and then I floored it, and sped home doing 70 plus down Rt.35 to my home.    I'm having difficultly dealing with this.  I KNOW WHAT I SAW.  I was not abducted but woul! d love to take a lie detector test or have a hypnosis session.;44.1034;-70.6551
