Bright light seen above horizon moving up and down erratically towards the northeast.;2007-07-14 01:00:00;10 Minutes;Bright light seen above horizon moving up and down erratically towards the northeast. While staying at a lodge on a mountain in Greenville, ME (I will not name the lodge, but will say that is has a clear view to the North and of Moosehead Lake) my father and I had returned from a night of moose watching around 12:30pm.  The sky was pitch black and many stars could be seen, including many high flying airplanes heading for Europe in the same path continuously.  However, towards the Northeast I saw a bright light, about as bright as a light from a lighthouse if it were a mile away, about 10 degrees above the horizon.  Now, there is a small airport with a light in that direction as well, but it was clearly distinguishable that this was not the airport light.  The light, which glimmered, traveled further to the East in a direction away from us.  I mentioned it to my father, who saw it for himself and admitted that he did not think it was an airplane.  The craft would move up and down about 5 degrees while moving towards the East.  The craft did this about five times while we watched it.  The color was an orange that changed slightly to a blue and red as it moved across the sky.  The object disappeared when it dove towards the horizon quickly and faded as it dropped.;45.4694;-69.5807
Red/green stationary light NW of Greenville, ME.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star?  PD));2014-10-12 21:00:00;unknown;Red/green stationary light NW of Greenville, ME. As I was admiring the night sky outside our camp I looked North towards Greenville and saw a red/green flashing light, thinking it was a plane but it did not move, it stayed stationary.   I watched it for awhile from the deck, then saw another smaller white light moving from the east to west that seemed to go beneath it.  I assumed this to be a plane.   I called to my husband and we went upstairs w/ binoculars for a better view.  It was still too far in the distance to make out anything clearly other than the red/green light.   We watched for about 20 mins and it did not move at all.   I looked again just befor bed at about 10 and did not see it at all.;45.4694;-69.5807
