bright circle of  intense light that vanished into a pinpoint;2009-08-18 19:45:00;1 to 2 minutes;bright circle of  intense light that vanished into a pinpoint My boy friend and I were swimming outside our remote lakeside camp. When we got out of the water, we were drying off on the dock. My BF said, What the h__is that? About 30 degrees above the horizon, there was a large,intensely bright cirlce of light. It was still daylight. The light was so bright it reflected in the water, casting a reflection like a full moon-- but much brighter. Out camp is in a remote area. There are no close neighbors. It was absolutely silent. The water was flat calm. We watched this for 1 to 2 minutes. Then it disappeared. It disappeareed as old TV sets used to turn off. Quickly going from a full bright circle down to a pinpoint of light, then it was gone. Neither my Bf or I had ever seen anything that could have been a UFO before. We have always been skeptical of sightings. I am 57, my bf is 66. He is an optometrist. We both have 20/20 eyesight. My bf has had a private pilot's license for 35 years. There is no explanation taht we could think of for this object.;45.8927;-67.8493
