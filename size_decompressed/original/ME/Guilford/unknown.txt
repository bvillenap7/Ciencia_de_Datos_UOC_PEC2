Shiny object hovering in the mountain range;2018-04-24 15:20:00;2 minutes;Shiny object hovering in the mountain range. I was returning home from work this afternoon taking 150 North toward Monson/Willimantic, just past the farm  and saw a silvery-shiny looking object in what seemed to come off a mountain.  I travel this road frequently and have never seen that object in that place before.  I saw it for about 30 seconds before turning around and went back to see if it was still there - it hadn't moved.  I looked at it for about a minute before deciding to maybe get closer or a better view but couldn't.  I shrugged it off as maybe someone had a satellite dish on the top of the mountain or it was something man made.  I took photos on my cell phone and looked at them when I got home and there is definitely some light reflection off of something.  As far as I could tell it didn't move and stayed stationary. I couldn't see much of a shape from the distance I was at but I originally thought it looked like a planchette from a quija board, although it may have been oval or rectangular with rounded ends.;45.1748;-69.3975
