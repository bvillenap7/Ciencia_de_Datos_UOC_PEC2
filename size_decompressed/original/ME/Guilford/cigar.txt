My mom and I observed silverish-grayish object above Piscatiquis River in Abbot;2002-10-16 15:00:00;2 Minutes;My mom and I observed silverish-grayish object above Piscatiquis River in Abbot Alright, my mom and I were headed north on Route 15, I just got out of school. I looked down the river on the river bend right after the 'Welcome to Abbot' sign and I looked up and I saw a silverish object in the sky maybe 3 miles away. By this time I alerted my mom who had no idea what it is, and noted that she did see it also. It occassionally went from a bright silver to a dull gray (maybe 4 or 5 times.) We passed some trees, the object was still there, and we still commented on it. After the next clump of trees it had dissapeard. It was more like an oval-ended rectangle shape, than anything else. The sky was clear, and behind the object there were a few Jet-Lines which was quite odd. There were a few clouds, and it was over a river. It hovered maybe 20 feet above the treeline, until it disapeared. I am a student at ((school name deleted)), I am 16 years old, and I have seen two other 'objects in different locations throughout the state. My mom is a homemaker, who had a stroke, and a car accident. It was a silver-dull gray color.;45.1748;-69.3975
