Circle object w/ rings of white light around the center w/ other spots of light circling around the rings object was not moving.;2014-09-28 19:30:00;All Night;Circle object w/ rings of white light around the center w/ other spots of light circling around the rings object was not moving. Several Unidentified Flying Objects around the town Portage, IN and over Lake Michigan. During the night time.  No specific Time.  Could've been there all night. 1 has been spotted 3 nights in a row 9/26, 9/27, & 9/28 @ 290 deg. N.W and 43 deg off the horizon from Porter Beach vantage point. 2 more were spotted 9/28 @ approx. 240 deg S.W. and 17 deg and 23 deg respectively from Porter beach vantage point. There was a 4th light further away around the NIPSCO power plant in Burns Harbor, IN that had the same characteristics of the other 3 with the naked eye but was not identified with a telescope. Looking through a telescope, objects appear to be round in shape with several rings of white light around the center. Several spots of light (white, blue, red) appears to be moving around the inner rings. Objects do not appear to be moving in the sky. With the Chicago Area airport shutdown the previous week 10/23-10/26 ish, it was thought that objects might be drones of some sort. Please investigate immediately. Thank you.;41.6133;-87.0446
