We observed an orange fireball in the sky.  At one point a white triangle of individual white lights appeared around the fireball briefly.  It was completely still, then suddenly it ascended upwards until we couldn't see it any longer.  We continued to watch, when suddenly from the north another fireball like the first appeared, and stopped in the same place as the first.  It didn't stay long, and ascended upwards.   At one point I briefly saw another white triangle of lights appear, but disappear just as quickly.  It quickly disappeared.  The orange ball looked like it was made of fire.  It didn't change shape.  It seemed like it was fairly low.  It was partly cloudy that night, and I could see stars.  When they ascended, it looked like they were in the same path in relation to a particular star in the sky. By the time the second one ascended it had to pass through a thin cloud that had appeared. So it was lower than the cloud. Actually it seemed pretty low.! It seemed like it was right there, but I am not a trained observer.  Lower than a small plane would be. This is my observation and thoughts.  Oh, there was no sound. Thank you;41.6133;-87.0446
