A star like object that hovered and appeared to change color.;2009-04-16 22:00:00;1 hour plus;A star like object that hovered and appeared to change color. It is about 10pm and i was contacted by my brother to look into the southwest sky. When i did i saw a bright star like object that appeared to stay in one plac and changed colors seemingly. I watched for about an hour and it was pretty much in the same spot and would get brighter every so often.;41.7327;-84.9496
