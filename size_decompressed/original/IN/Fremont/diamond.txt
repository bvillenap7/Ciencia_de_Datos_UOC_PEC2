While taking a break from paperwork in my garage office (it was a very clear, crisp, fall day) I was keeping track of these huge praying manti that were looking for sunlight on the eave of the garage when I noticed what I immediately thought was a door falling off of a jetliner.  It was just east of due north and 60 dagrees above the horizon and it appeared to be falling at a downward angle drifting eastward of straight down.  I was at first convinced it was a door from a jet plane, then realized it was much too reflective-mirror-like to be a painted surface.  As I started to calculate where it would land, it stopped dead in the air, instantly.  I then realized several things it was much larger and farther away than I originally thought, and the shape of it was in reality 2 pyramids base to base, with mirrored surfaces.  The diamond shape appeared to be revolving, in place, at about 60 cycles per second (a rough guess), and was oriented vertically,straight up and down.  Just as I was trying to guess the size of it (about the size of my index fingernail held at arms length) some of the few small clouds that were in the sky drifted in front of it, it then started falling again.  It was then I realized it was not falling at all, but it was moving across the sky as a satellite would at night, it sparkled and moved in that easterly direction, getting slightly smaller, until the tree line at the horizon obscured it.  When it was gone I was dumbstruck and tried to reason that I had seen a large satellite in the middle of the day?  If so, it had to have been huge, and have the ability to stop instantly, and the diamond shape was absolutely unmistakable, it was easily seen with the naked eye.
