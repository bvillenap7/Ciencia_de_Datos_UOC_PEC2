3 orange globes.;2003-07-15 23:00:00;23:00 - 1:00;3 orange globes. I was sitting in my parents' living room watching television and I looked through a windown in another room and i saw three orange globes floating around in very erratic patterns, almost as if someone were holding a flashlight and quickly swinging it around in no pattern whatsoever.   I was too frightened to go into the next room and look more closely, so i went to my room upstairs.  In my room I have a skylight window and while looking through this window, i saw one globe moving straight up and down very quickly right in my line of sight through the window.  I almost felt as if the globe knew i could see it and it were mocking me.   I called my then girlfriend on the phone and talked to her as it was occurring.   After a while the globe went away, and i've never seen it since.;38.2069;-87.4212
