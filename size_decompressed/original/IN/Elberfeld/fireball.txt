As I was approaching the I64 crossover, I saw a bright green fireball with a long greenish tail. My first thought was that it was a plane crashing but then realized it was green, not red like fire. I slowed my car and pulled over onto the shoulder. I was in a panic when the next thought was this was a meteor which had not burned up. The size if it was huge, approximately the size of a doppler radar globe. I was trying to remember how large of an explosion would be generated by one this size when it began to slow down. As it slowed, the tail was breaking up into sparkles and it sounded like static as a television shuts down-crackling. It was moving West to East. It passed over a gas station toward fields. I sat there a moment in shock but too afraid to investigate in the dark. The next morning, I left for work early and drove down the country road it had gone down in. There were no broken trees or holes or scorched fields. I have no idea what I saw but it was not a plane, nor a meteor. It was about tree top level and speed was observable, meaning it was not in the far reaches of space.;38.2069;-87.4212
