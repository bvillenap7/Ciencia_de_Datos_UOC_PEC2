Large, Bright LED type light flying low and fast then dimming out quickly.;2008-09-25 06:15:00;Seconds;Large, Bright LED type light flying low and fast then dimming out quickly. Thursday, September 25, 2008 Approximately 0615-0620. I was driving home from work when I seen one bright LED type light out of the corner of my eye.  I looked to my left out the window and observed a large oval shaped bright LED type light flying (south bound) at a high rate of speed, at a very low altitude (200-300ft).  I immediately nailed my brakes as the object passed directly in front of me.   At this exact same time the bright LED type light disappeared.  The light did not go directly out it dimmed out quickly.  I stopped my patrol car and got out. I observed nothing, absolutely nothing. I guess I was expecting to see airplane lights or here the sound of a jet, but there was nothing. My background is Law Enforcement.;40.4566;-85.3733000000001
