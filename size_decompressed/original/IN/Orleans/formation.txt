Saw a straight line of what seemed like a hundred or more white lights in a straight line. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));2019-05-25 01:00:00;1 minute;I looked up when talking to my sister to see a straight line of what seemed like a hundred or more white lights in a straight line moving north.  The lights were about a mile or so long and high in the sky.  When I ran to try to get a clear photo the lights dimmed and faded out. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));38.6558;-86.4611
