gray in my room;1998-06-30 01:00:00;5 minutes;gray in my room   had a recurring event w/1 gray in bedroom. terrifying. body frozen with fear. could not escape, gray could read my thoughts, anticipate what I was going to do. finally, in one event, i kept telling myself i must free my arms, break the paralysis. it was hard but i did, the image of the gray faded like mist, and i have not had an event since. I have to conclude that these were bad dreams, and people that claim abduction at nite from their beds are also having bad dreams. The media has created this image of the grays, and it is unnerving, unsettling. What are the triangles? Why doesn't someone build an array of video cameras and make a constant observation of the night sky for an extended period of time?

We saw some object in the sky move very slowly that was not a plane or a star.;2004-02-01 01:00:00;>1 hour;We saw some object in the sky move very slowly that was not a plane or a star. We're not sure if it is a craft or some object in the sky. My g/f and I were in bed when I looked out the window (in the South West direction) and saw this flashing object in the sky, about the size as any star looks from here. Except it was moving very slowly. Somtimes it would move less slow and other times it would just seem to come to a halt. We are sure it moved though. I have it on camera. At one point it seems to have something break off of it. Every once in a while it appears to turn to red from blue for short periods of time. We are sure it is not a plane, and we are sure it is not a star in the sky.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
Bluish white dots seen over south bend, IN;2006-02-20 01:00:00;10-20 minutes;bluish white dots seen over south bend, IN on the night in question i was sitting in front of my house in my car talking on the phone, i was leaning back pretty far in my seat. i saw something move from the corner of my eye, i looked up out of the car window and saw nothing. i continued talking on the phone and about 3mins later i saw something again, i looked again and saw nothing again, i thought i might have just barely saw a &quotshooting star&quot as i have seen those before. i went back to talking on the phone for another few minutes and saw something again from the corner of my eye and i looked and was thinking maybe it was a meteor shower, i got out of the car and saw a blueish white dot flying around in high in the sky. it was flying around like a house fly does, zipping around really fast. i stared and stared trying to listen to see if i could hear any sound because i thought i might of been a bat flying but bats dont emit light at night and you can see their wings. in the background was ! a streetlight which helped me kind of determine how high up this dot was, the light from the streetlight was not nearly enough for me to make out a shape, if it had been a bat the streetlight would have shown me because the bat would have been closer to it and bats dont fly up that high. so while i observed this dot flying around and heard no sound at all, the dot was flying across the sky at extremely high rates of speed, faster than anything i had ever seen move in the air and cover that much distance in such little time, the agility of this dot was stunning, changing direction abruptly without appearing to slow down. after several minutes i noticed another blueish white dot appear from seemingly knowhere and began to kind of interact with the other dot, i compare to two house flies flying around each other if you have ever noticed anything like that...really fast and going in every direction really fast. after a few more minutes another dot appeared from knowhere and now there were 3 blueish white dots flying around in the air, going back and forth across the sky at very high rates of speed, changing direction flawlessly, with absolutely no sound coming from the 3 dots. after observing all 3 dots for several minutes they all flew into a horizontal line, stopped and then they all shot straight up into the sky faster than anything i have ever seen fly or move and the dot on the left flew off to the left and the dot on the right flew off to the right and the dot in the middle continued straight up...this is when i realized that these dots were up extremely high because they would go up so high and disappear and then reappear all of a sudden. so after that show the dots continued to fly around like fly's and one by one they flew off into the distance disappearing from view and they were gone and nothing was left...no cars came down my street at this time, there were no other planes in the sky that i noticed and i live close to an airport and hear and see planes flying up very high all the time.

Object travelling in night sky below cloud deck eastbound illuminated (flashing & steady) green, red, white & shimmering violet light.;2010-03-25 21:00:00;3 minutes;Object travelling in night sky below cloud deck eastbound illuminated (flashing & steady) green, red, white & shimmering violet light. This object was observed while driving in residential area north of the University of Notre Dame. Weather was overcast and object was below the cloud deck. What at first appeared (and was assumed to be) a very large commercial aircraft took on a very different appearance upon closer inspection. An impressive display of flashing lights is what caught my eye. Green and red lights similar to standard aviation craft were seen...however these were arrayed in larger numbers, particularly the red lights. A deep fluorescent violet light began to shimmer at one point along at least one edge of the object. As the object passed more overhead I could then see the bottom of it. On this aspect I could see a large bank of white lights (these were not bright white but had a somewhat warmer and yellow/orange tone) in a rectangular pattern. These somewhat shimmered and sparkled. The object was traveling due east at a steady but undetermined speed. My guess was that it was traveling at approximately 300 to 600 MPH (depending on the actual height of it). The object appeared to be quite large in that as it got further away, it did not really seem to diminish in size too much. On the other hand, it was below the cloud deck (the altitude of which I do not know), so sizing the object in that regard was not possible. I was driving alone and simply could not pull over in traffic to get a better look. There was a solid black background slightly visible behind these lights...so it was almost assuredly a solid structure that I was looking at. If I had to guess, my general impression was that the object had a somewhat triangular shape. The size of the object by pure general impression, would have been approximately the size 1 to 4 times the size of a Boeing 747. I lost sight of the object behind trees. The type of lights on the object were shimmering (violet), flashing (red and green), steady (red and green) as well as the steady yellow white rectangular lights which had a shimmering to sparkling aspect to them as well. The object, while in my view, did not behave any differently than that of an aircraft except that I have never seen an aircraft which was lit up in this spectacular fashion.  Very interesting. I found your site after wondering if I could locate a similar type of sighting.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
Two orange objects set apart in the sky more than four moons apart moved in tandem then one disappeared shortly  followed by the other.;2012-12-25 19:51:00;40 seconds;Two orange objects set apart in the sky more than four moons apart moved in tandem then one disappeared shortly  followed by the other. My wife and I looked out our car window and saw 2 orange objects witch my wife says looked like bisected spheres glowing and hovering in a stationary manner.  As we approached a stop sign that was in line with their position one object disappeared followed by the other briefly there after. Also, my wife tried to take a picture but couldn't get an image on her crappy old phone.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
Strange orange ball of light.;2014-10-25 18:45:00;10 minutes;Strange orange ball of light. Around 6:45pm, my son (9) called  me outside to see a wierd thing in the sky. At first I thought it was a comet, but it didn't move.  It was orange and several miles away.  It slowly got smaller, but stayed in the same location.  Before it faded away, it appeared to dart back and forth a bit.  I looked at local news sites, but there was no mention of a meteor or a comet.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
Craft repeatedly above the South Bend airport (drone or what?);2016-06-13 00:15:00;nightly;Craft repeatedly above the South Bend airport (drone or what?) I have seen a strange object in the sky for well over a year.  It appears to be hovering above the south bend airport.  It is definitely not a star or satellite.  I have seen this thing many times and it does move.  I can't tell if this is some sort of craft used by the airport or military and I can't find anything about this object.  I was wondering if its some sort of drone, but it stays in the sky for a long time and the lights on it are extremely bright.  I've seen it with different lights (red, green and white ) and not always the same.  I don't have any sophisticated equipment to get a good look at it.  I've tried a cheap telescope, but I can't make out any definitive shape, although it clearly wasn't anything I've seen before.  I would imagine someone else besides my family has seen this thing and if so, maybe someone knows something.  All I want to know is what this is.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229

I was standing outside sipping coffee with some co workers and it's a little dark out, before the sun came up.  Suddenly there was this really bright flash streak in a woosh shape.  Like it came close but sling shot itself the other way.  And the only thing left in the sky were the lights of an airplane flying in the distance.  We are relatively close to an airport at my work so we see airplane lights all the time, but this was just ridiculous.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
