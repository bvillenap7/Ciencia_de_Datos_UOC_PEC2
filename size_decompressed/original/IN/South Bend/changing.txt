I witnessed a black shape-shifting black mass in the sky .;2005-05-25 19:45:00;20 minutes;I witnessed a black shape-shifting black mass in the sky . At 7:45 ((p.m.)) eastern time I witnessed a black shape-shifting black mass in the sky traveling in a gentle southeast to northwest direction approximately 2 miles south of the indiana/michigan border between Niles, Michigan and South Bend, Indiana.  I watched this phenomenon for at least 20 minutes before it was obscured by moving clouds.  I saw several jets go by and the speed of this black shape-shifting mass seemed to be at the same altitude but move very slowly.  I attributed it to some extremely high flying bird formation but it seemed very unusual.  On November 16th 1999, I observed a low flying fireball over New Carlisle, Indiana and you were kind enough to let me know something about it.  I still had the email and your address.  I am an amateur sky-watcher and I never seem to have any photography equipment when I see these things.  Has anybody else seen this and is there an explanation?  Thanks in advance for your response .;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
There were 3 lights, there were 2 lights at first, then one more appeared, they were moving in a circualr movement sorta.;2012-11-21 23:00:00;10 minutes;There were 3 lights, there were 2 lights at first, then one more appeared, they were moving in a circualr movement sorta. Well my brother went outside just to chill, then about 5 minutes later he told me to come outside and the see this object, and I could not believe what I was seeing.  There were 3 lights, there were 2 lights at first, then one more appeared, two lights were moving aligned and the one light appeared a little bit after I noticed the other two, and then it was moving in circular movement, it looked like a changed shape sorta. The complexity of it was difficult to describe.  But what I just told was very clear.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229

My back yard faces west, with a generous rural view.  Usually I I drink my morning coffee while looking at falling meteors.  After sitting down, I looked out at the night sky.  Over to the northwest  part of the sky, I noticed a bright yellowish star or planet, no big deal.   after playing a game on my phone I looked up  and the light had moved closer.  This caught my attention  so I stood up to look a little longer.  It was moving south east . thought it was a plane but there were no wing lights or sound.  as I watched, I called to my wife to come look at this..  then all of the sudden the yellowish  light changed into a a white highlighted arrow shape, it changed patterns a few times, then stayed on the arrow head shape and dissappeared.   have never see anything like this ever.  as far as my personal background, I'm an artist, and my eyes are trained to see what's there not what I want to see.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
