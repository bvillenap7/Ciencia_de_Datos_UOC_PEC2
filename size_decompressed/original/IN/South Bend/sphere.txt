150 foot glowing redish-orange object over northern Indiana on April 4th, 2004 (23:00).;2004-04-04 22:00:00;10-15 seconds;150 foot glowing redish-orange object over northern Indiana on April 4th, 2004 (23:00). The date was Sunday April 4th 2004, at exactly 10pm (23:00). I can be sure of the time because the news had just started on the television and it was time to let my Irish setter outside to do his job. One thing I want to point out here, is that my wife and I live just south of South Bend, Indiana city limits and We have a completely unabstructed veiw of the horrizon to the south. I had no sooner hooked the dog chain up, when my Irish Setter lunged out the door and started barking up in the air at an object flying over our backyard and off into the distance. I stood tranfixed on the sight.  The object was a bright orange-red color like somthing on fire but with no actual flames or tail coming from it. It appeared to be a sphirical shape. It made no sound at all. The object was not falling to the ground, but rather on a level flight path. The night ski was pretty much clear that night. Judging the size would be to much of a guess but if I were being pressed, I would say that it had to be nearly 150 feet or more in diamiter and seemed to be traveling at a very high speed. The object took a direct path due south. I stood outside on my back porch and watched the object until I could no longer see it beyond the horizon. The whole episode took maybe 15 seconds. I see airplanes and gliders and such all the time out my backyard view and I can tell you that this was non of these. I am a well known Business owner in the community and well respected. I am a Buddhist LAma, I have several Degrees and am not prone to flights of fancy. If the truth be known, I would have just forgot about this, but after seeing other reports a few weeks later in the same area, I thought that this should be reported to someone.  (I would like to add, that 25 years ago while driving south toward Odessa texas, I and at least 5 other drivers saw this EXACT SAME OBJECT FLY OVER US. aT LEAST FIVE OTHER CARS AND TRUCTS ALL PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND GOT OUT TO ASK IF WE HAD ALL JUST SEEN THAT OBJECT. AGAIN, THIS SEEMS TO BE THE EXACT SAME OBJECT THAT I SAW ON APRIL 4TH 2004.);41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
A spherical craft several hundred feet up moving steadily east over Cleveland Road in South Bend, Indiana.;2011-08-19 10:20:00;30 seconds;A spherical craft several hundred feet up moving steadily east over Cleveland Road in South Bend, Indiana. This sighting took place on Friday, August 19th, 2011, at about 10:20 am. The weather was sunny and cloudless. The moon was visible in the western sky. I was driving west on Cleveland Road in South Bend when I noticed a dark circular or spherical object at least several hundred feet up in the air, moving east.  The object moved parallel with the road at a steady speed with no erratic motion. It was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or a bird.  It could possibly have been a satellite of some sort, but the object seemed to change its shape subtly as I observed it, especially toward the end of the sighting, which lasted about 30 seconds. The object reflected sunlight and appeared metallic. As soon as the object passed from view, I did a sharp U-turn and parked in a nearby driveway, got out of my car, and looked east to try to see the object again, but I couldn't spot it. I had just been talking to my 4 year old son about the moon and how mysterious it is. Just a minute before the sighting he had craned his head down below his car seat shoulder strap to peek out the windshield in order to see the moon (which he saw).  He did not see the ufo. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be exceptionally lucid and eloquent in his description of his sighting.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD));41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
Seen at first on the NW horizon. Headed in SE direction.;2012-09-09 00:30:00;3-4 minutes;Seen at first on the NW horizon. Headed in SE direction. Bright white orb color and shape. We were just finished viewing Venus with telescope when this came into view at a very high speed right over us.  Much faster than any aircraft we have ever seen.  This was very bright and low enough to appear as a large orb.  No lights, no tail and no exhaust.  Silently crossed the sky.  Very impressive.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
About 10 red lights rising in the sky, appeared to maneuver - second sighting in five years, same part of the sky.;2017-04-17 21:00:00;5 minutes;About 10 red lights rising in the sky, appeared to maneuver - second sighting in five years, same part of the sky. Saw a number of red lights in the sky.  Appeared to be distant.  Originated below the horizon (obscured behind buildings) and rose in the sky while moving steadily from left to right from my perspective.  Lights were North and East of my position. Lights moved with constant speed but did not follow a constant path.  Vertical component of velocity changed - lights changed rate of rise and at some points descended.  Horizontal component seemed steady. Saw about 10 total lights. Initially saw them when coming around the corner of a building that obscured the sky and immediately say about 7 in the same part of the sky.  No obvious formation to them but they were all in the same few minutes of arc in the sky.  One by one the lights faded and disappeared.  As the last of the original lights disappeared a new one rose into view, then another, then another at wide intervals.  They all rose and then disappeared as the original 7 did. Did not appear to be flares as they steadily rose and covered a very large distance (assuming hey were far away, as was my impression.)  Again, they appeared to change vertical component of velocity several times.  My sense was they were maneuvering. I have seen this phenomena before in the same part of the sky from a nearby (2 miles away) location about five years ago.  I am an avid airplane enthusiast, an atheist, and a general skeptic - I am not prone to false beliefs and delusion.  These were not aircraft lights or flares.  I do not believe they are alien craft but I cannot explain them by phenomena known to me.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
