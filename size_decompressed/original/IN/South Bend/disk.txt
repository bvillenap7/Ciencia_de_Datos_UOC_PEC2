It was a grayish disk-like object so I started watching it. When I turned to tell my friend look, there were three more next to it. They seemed to just hover in one spot. It was weird because then as I looked a little to the right, I saw two more. They seemed to be moving back and forth and just switching places. The sun was setting so I got a pretty good view of them. The all just seemed to be hovering over this corn field.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
