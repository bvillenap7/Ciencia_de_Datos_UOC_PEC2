I left my work, on Fir Road in Mishawaka, Indiana 46530, at 21:55 sharp. I punched a clock at this time. Before entering my car, at exactly 22:00, my attention was diverted upward to the sky,to watch a three fast moving large orange, round balls of light, with one out in the front lead and two more following, pretty close and side by side, less than ¼ mile behind the first one. I then observed the first one’s light becoming smaller, as it moved a great distance, very quickly, in a straight level flight pattern, becoming dimmer and smaller and then disappeared. It seemed to maintain a constant speed but grew smaller and smaller and then I was unable to see any light at all. The light dimmed smaller than the surrounding stars. The two that were following, did the same thing. They were bright and big, then dimmer and then not observable any longer. Just as the first group of three was disappearing, another group of three came in, one out in front, with two more trailing and did exactly the same sequence of events. They were just flying straight and appeared larger than an airplane and such a different color and a bright ball similar to a sodium street light, kind of an orange.  There was a little twinkling and at one time, I thought I could see like a red strobe, perhaps is the best way to describe it. To my astonishment, this groups of orange balls, totaled to about 9 groups, or about 23-27 objects, going from the North, over Cleveland Road, to the South, and disappeared, as if it reached out of sight very, very fast, as it got smaller and dimmer and then invisible. There was another gentleman, who pulled into the same parking lot, and was observing them, he got out of his car, opened his trunk, and then drove off without conversing. I reported the sighting to the South Bend Police Department at 24:00, and they said that no one else reported seeing them, that I was the first.  I do not understand that no one else saw what I have seen, as God is my witness.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
