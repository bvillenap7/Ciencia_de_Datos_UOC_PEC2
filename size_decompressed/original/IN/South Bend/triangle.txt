It started out we were driving down a dirt road and stopping at a stop sign that led to paved road there was kind of a hill that we were stopped at with our bright light's on i looked up in the sky about 200 ft from the ground i saw a triangle type object with three lights at the corners that were orange and a big spot light that was pointed at the ground i flicked my lights on then off the spot light and all of the lights shut off i rolled the window to see what i copuld hear i thought it might have been a helicopter but there was no noise but my car so i took off and looked to my right and the object turned and the orange lights flashed i started speeding and blew a stop sign and it was still beside me i started going over interstate 69 and it flew over my car i looked up and could see it through my t tops in the middle there was a glowing i could see all the details of then i just slowed down and it took off i told some friends and family but i never really thought there would be anybody that would believe this a year later on unsolved mysteries they had a guy that worked for the government on who was telling about a craft that the governmet admits the designed it but they wont admit to building it the really freaky thing was that this object i saw looked extremely like the drawing he was showing down to every detail it was supposed to run on mercury and be totally silent ((NUFORC Note:  Date in May 1997 is approximate.

Saw triangular craft in early Fall 9-12 years ago that was either jet black or transparent with three lights in Northern Indiana.;2000-09-01 22:00:00;10 minutes;Saw triangular craft in early Fall 9-12 years ago that was either jet black or transparent with three lights in Northern Indiana. I believe this event took place in the early Fall of the year 2000 or 2003 (sorry about the gap) at approximately 10:00 pm. My best friend and I had just finished clearing trails in his woods and we were making our way back to his house, crossing a grassy field to get there. Headed towards us we saw what we thought was an airplane at first, especially considering that there is an airport somewhat nearby. This craft had three solid white lights on it, arranged in a wide triangle shape. The lights were not blinking and the craft was completely silent. It seemed to be flying very low, enough so that we certainly would have heard this thing if it was just another passenger airplane. Besides the fact that this craft was completely silent, a couple of things really grabbed our attention. First, we realized that this thing was either jet black or totally transparent between the lights. Realizing that detail was very unsettling. The second thing that really grabbed ! our attention, and the thing that caused us to run towards his house (this whole time we were just standing there watching this thing), was when it changed direction. Up to this point the craft was moving very slowly, as far as we could tell, in a straight line directly toward and over us. This thing seemed to suddenly and completely stop, do a 180 degree turn, and head back in the direction that it came from. There was never a shift in speed, from what I could tell. After that 180 degree turn we were both startled enough to run to the house and pretty much pretend that none of that happened. All of this happened about 9-12 years ago and I've told very few people about the event, probably because I'm afraid of what they'd think of me.  I'm no expert on aircraft but I was in the U.S. Army and I saw my fair share of passenger, fighter, transport/cargo, and unmanned aircraft during my service and never once did I see anything like that. I heard about you last night on Coast to Coast (I work midnights and have nothing to do on my break so, typically, I listen to Coast to Coast) and so I figured I'd file the report. Thank you for your time ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
The object made a sharp right turn, spun around and shot off like a bullet.;2004-08-15 15:45:00;Aprx.  4 mins.;The object made a sharp right turn, spun around and shot off like a bullet. While watching some turkey-buzzards sunday afternoon I noticed a high altitude craft moving from southeast to northwest almost straight above me, at first I though it was pretty amazing that a buzzard could fly that high  Then it made a 90 degree turn with no arc or loss of speed.  I ran into my house and got my binoculars, when I got got back it was maneuvering erratically a little to the north. When I got a good look at it, it was a black triangle with a bright red line accross the back. It was wider than long, like a large hang-glider.  After about 30 seconds it stopped and rotated slowly in place one complete turn then shot off to the east like a bullet.  The sky was mostly clear and blue with a few puffy white clouds.  It looked to me to be as high as commercial air traffic which would have made it about the size of a 747.  I noticed no sound but I could hear a jet at about the same altitude a few seconds later moving in almost the same direction.  The triangle left no contrail but the jet did.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
Triangular UFO over South Bend, IN moving southeast on 11-23-06 at 20:25.;2006-11-23 20:25:00;20 seconds;Triangular UFO over South Bend, IN moving southeast on 11-23-06 at 20:25. Triangular shape and moving across the night sky to the southeast.   There was enough time for me to mention it to 2nd person and for them to see the same thing.   The sky was clear and we were looking toward the star cluster Pleiades.   We listened for ANY sounds that might indicate a jet, but there was no sound at all.  The rate of speed, if a jet would have made this object low enough to make quite profound engine noise.  If higher in the sky, then this object would clearly be quite large.   The shape identified by us was by seeing an outline of dimly lit lights or light reflection along its front two edges only.   The light was about the same color as what we usually see reflecting from the clouds near the sulfur halogen lights of the nearby interstate.   The trajectory was straight and we were able to see it until it disappeared behind a row of trees.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229

I can't believe they are now showing up in my small town...;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229

The craft flew very fast from the NE to SW but not in a straight pattern it was out of sight within 7 seconds.  There were no sounds made by the craft as it flew overhead.

It kept on moving south then it took off it disappear.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
