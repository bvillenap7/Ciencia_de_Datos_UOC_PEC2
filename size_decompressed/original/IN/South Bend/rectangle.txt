I was sitting on my back door step when I heard a whistle (like that of a hawk). I looked straight up, thinking to see a hawk when I saw a black, coffin shaped craft over head moving directly away from me, I heard the whistle 1 more time until it went behind a line of trees. My impression was that this craft was low, 800-1500ft. and moving very fast (could have crossed the entire sky directly overhead in about 7 sec.). It moved in a very straight line at a constant speed.  It was sunny, clear, and about 75-80 degrees, with some high cumulus clouds. There seems to have been some heat distortion/haze at the rear of the craft. The craft seemed to be about 30 ft. long or the length of a Cessna 172. I like to watch and identify (with my field guide and binoculars) the aircraft, both private and commercial that fly over my house.  I am very familiar with the types, their shapes, speeds, routes, and flight characteristics. This was no know aircraft, and other than the whistle, was silent.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
Repeated white rectangle and round object by airport and hiding behind cloud;2005-06-23 12:20:00;10-15 mts;Repeated white rectangle and round object by airport and hiding behind cloud I have witnessed UFO's on my way to work several times.  This was just the last time. The area I see them is always by the airport going down the highway.  Now, the first time, I noticed a round bright light in the clear blue sky that would fade out and reappear as I traveled along. It seemed to stay with me.  It didn't move. It seemed to stay fixed in the sky except when it would fade out and reappear almost as if to stay with me.  This lasted about ten minutes and was in September of 2003.  This past year I have noticed it at least two other times.  Except two other times it was not a light but a solid round white object that seemed to hover and then zoom off into the distance.  The last sighting looked like a white rectangle that I was open to the possibility of it being a jet.  So I watched it as it went behind a cloud and never came out.  I watched that cloud for at least ten minutes.  I really felt that it wasn't a plane, but knew for sure when it hid behind a cloud.  I have had other experiences in my life since I was little, including lights surrounding my bed and not being able to move. My sister was a witness to this and stared in shock.  Also, a couple years ago my son noticed a moving star when he looked out his window.In that same time period he showed me a rash under his left rib cage that was the shape of a perfect equilateral triangle.  This is just the surface of the things I've seen.  I'm beginning to think that they're following me. By the way, my very first sighting was when I was about nine.  I noticed a glowing green oval shaped object darting in a zig zag pattern in the sky and then disappearing.  The lights in my room occurred when I was about four.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
