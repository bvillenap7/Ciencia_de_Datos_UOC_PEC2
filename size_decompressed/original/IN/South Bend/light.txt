We were driving home. this was in the 6pm hour. just before 7:30, i went to the back door of my house to quiet my dog who was barking a t pedestrians or another dog. When i opened the door, i noticed a round steady light in the west sky. I was surprised at how far the planet (jupiter?) had moved away from the moon, which i could see to the south. I looked at the 'planet' for a few seconds, and picked up a red hue in it. i thought that it might be mars. i looked away to yell at the dog. when i looked back up, the light was gone. I never heard a noise, or saw any movement. It's a very clear, cold night here. I could see planes clearly. I have peered around the garage to see if it had set, i saw nothing. it was there, i looked away for a few seconds, looked back, and it was gone.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
Witnessed 3 points of light zipping around the night sky interacting with one another;2006-02-01 01:00:00;20mins;Witnessed 3 points of light zipping around the night sky interacting with one another I was in my car one night on the phone in front of my house around 1am. I was laid back in the driver seat, and noticed something in my peripheral vision. I turned my head to look and didnt see anything. I continue talking and a few minutes later I notice something again, I look and dont see anything, I'm thinking maybe it's a meteorite. A few minutes later it happens again, I look and see a point of light flying around. I got out of  my car to see it better. I'm standing on the sidewalk in front of my house under a streetlight looking up, I thought it could have been a bat but I saw no wings flapping and bats dont give off light in the dark, so I knew it was up higher. So now its above my house up high in the air zipping back and forth across the sky like a house fly and moving really fast. This is going on for several minutes I tried to call 2 ppl and they didn't answer because it was late. I tried to wake up my parents they werent interested. Our video ca! mera battery was dead of course. I went back outside and it there was 2 points of light zipping around with each other, all over the sky. And then a 3rd point of light appeared and began doing the same thing. This goes on for several minutes more and all of a sudden they got into a horizontal line and paused, then shot straight up into the sky very fast and the two points of light on the ends flew off to the left and right, the light in the middle just kept going up until I couldnt see it anymore. They all returned and flew around more and then they started to have a trail of like glitter or sparkles behind them while they flew around. This lasted a few seconds and they continued zipping around. Then one by one they started to fly off to the east and they were gone, I waited a few minutes to see if they would return and they didn't and that was it. They had to be 10's of thousands of feet in the atmosphere. There was no noise or anything coming from the lights and the light! s weren't extremely bright but were white in color. I've never! seen an ything that high fly around in that manner so fast and do the maneuvers I saw,it was amazing. Never seen anything like that again but I'm always looking up in the sky now, ever since.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
We saw a huge light with a large craft behind it, low in the sky for about 20 minutes, then it slowly moved northwest;2007-06-14 23:30:00;45 MINUTES;We saw a huge light with a large craft behind it, low in the sky for about 20 minutes, then it slowly moved northwest My sister and I were sitting in her back yard at about 11:30 pm on June 14, 2007. She noticed a large, very bright, white light in the sky and told me to look at it, wondering if it was a star.  This was in the western night sky.  I immediately said that was something unusual.  We positioned ourselves to face the light directly and watched it for nearly an hour.  We originally thought it might be a star, but it was too large and bright.  I told her that it made me nervous.  Was it a helicopter?  Or, a plane?  It was motionless for so long, that it could be neither.  Maybe it was a blimp, but a blimp wouldn't be out at this time of night and doesn't have a light coming out of the front of it.  It was obvious that a craft of some sort was behind the light.  We called our father, who was at his house nearly a mile west of us.  He and our step-mother went into the driveway and looked at the light.  He said he believed that it was Jupiter - that the planet was low in the western sky now.  We continued to watch the light and nearly 20 minutes later, it began moving in a northwesterly direction.  Our niece came out during this time and watched it with us.  Our brother came by and said it had to have been a hot air balloon flying at night.  This was not possible because the light was too large and the craft was behind the light, as opposed to above it. Also, the light wasn't a flame.  The light began slowly moving and became smaller as it headed northwest.  Within another 2o to 30 minutes, it was gone below the trees.  It was so unusual, though, because it hovered in one place (we wondered if it was over the Golden Dome of Notre Dame, as it looked like it was above the campus).  There is no way it could have been a star because of the way it moved and because of the direction it took.  All the other stars in the sky, which were obviously so much farther away, didn't visibly move in the sky like this light did.  It was different from the movement of the moon, as the path and speed of movement were very inconsistent.  When we looked at the light at first, it looked like a giant 5-point star.  There is a street light that shines in the trees near where we saw the light.  What we saw was much  bigger than the size of the street light.  We called a local television station and asked if anyone had called in this sighting. He told me that we were the first.  I am wondering if any Notre Dame students saw it, as it appeared to be above the area of the campus.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
Glowing succession of flying objects on the horizon.;2008-10-10 19:00:00;10 minutes;Glowing succession of flying objects on the horizon. We were at a back  yard party in South Bend, IN when I noticed a very bright orange light flying on the horizon.  The light at first glance resembled an airplane, but was being followed closely by other objects of the exact same description.  They looked exactly alike and were flying too close to each other to be airplanes.  They were flying due west of us.  Everyone at the gathering agreed that planes and helicopters do not fly like that.  And they glowed a bright yellow or orange.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
Six Red/Orange objects fly over South Bend, Indiana.;2013-07-13 22:15:00;5 minutes;Six Red/Orange objects fly over South Bend Indiana. 	I live about 4 miles north of downtown South Bend Indiana and a mile and a half north of Notre Dame Indiana.  At 10:15 pm on July 13 2013 I was watching TV when I looked out of my living room window to the South and saw a red/orange object traveling from the East going to the West. It looked to be about twice the size of the brightest star. I went out into my back yard and saw that there were two of them.  I got my phone in video mode and filmed them until they went behind my neighbors trees.  I saw that there were three more coming into view and I filmed them as well until they also went behind the trees.  I switched my phone into HD mode and got another, much better video of one of the objects.  When I zoomed into the last one you can see its colors changing rapidly. 	They were all traveling at the same speed and in the same direction but not in a straight line.  One was a little lower than the rest.  I donâ€™t know how fast they were moving but they came into view from around a tree to my due South and went out of my view behind my neighbors tree to the Southwest of my house, in about a minuet to a minuet and a half. 	After the six objects all were out of view I stayed outside for another half hour to see if there were any more.  There were not. 	I have uploaded the videos I took to my Facebook account and will embed links to both below. https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10201801310657340&l=4700501642669154771   https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10201801289256805&l=38328169986020255   Thank you for your time.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229

Bright light moving fast out in the cornfeilds;2013-07-31 20:59:00;2 minutes;Bright light moving fast out in the cornfeilds Was driving east on Douglas road just past capital ave. saw a Bright bluish light traveling in the feild to my left over a corn feild - it speed up a head of us , and crossed over to the right , then it proceeded to travel west very quickly, I asked my wife to keep an eye on it . it started to head upward and faster .. then was just gone.  It was low enough that we saw it when it crossed the road to be in front of the tree line along Bittersweet rd.  so I think it went behind the house on the left and crossed the road in front of the tree line to the right .. it was too low to have traveled down bittersweet .;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229

At exactly 6:32 AM EDT, stepped outside to take my daughter to school.  While facing North, I noticed an unusually bright star.  The star accelerated from a fixed position moving from West to East.  I noticed a number of fainter, smaller, star-like objects floating around it.   The area around the brighter object was distorted in a type of lensing effect. Very briefly a cone of light like a spot light emanated from the side of it.  I called my daughter over to witness the object as it sped away.  We agreed there were no strobing light, no colored lights, no sound, and therefore, it was not a conventional/commercial aircraft.   We live close to the airport and always recognize commercial aircraft readily.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229

Four lights in a staright line hovering in a stationary position.;2015-02-19 19:00:00;30 seconds;Four lights in a stright line hovering in a stationary position. My family and I were driving east on Douglas Rd. just before Grape Road in South Bend, near Mishawaka.  It was snowing and very cold and windy.   About 1/2 mile before Grape Rd. I saw 4 white lights in a straight line in the sky just to my right (south).  At first I figured it was an airplane heading to the airport, but then I realized the lights weren't moving--they were just staying in one place.   I pointed it out to my wife and kids and they all saw it too.  We couldn't figure out what it was.  As we got near it, it finally began to move to the west in a straight line.  It was definitely not a helicopter because the lights didn't match any that I know of, and I put my window down and didn't hear anything.  The only thing we could guess it might be was a drone, but for a drone to be flying in that kind of weather just doesn't make sense.   It was probably 200 yards or so off the ground.  I didn't see any sort of the typical saucer shape, nor did it fly off at incredible speeds, but we couldn't identify it, therefore to us it remains a ufo, and I wanted to report it for what it's worth.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229

Witness reporteda light zig zagging and maneuvering at incredible speed.  ((MUFON report));2018-05-06 23:51:00;Several minutes;Witness reporteda light zig zagging and maneuvering at incredible speed Witness noticed an object with blinking lights moving at an incredibly high rate of speed and zig zagging through the sky.  It would stop abruptly and then accelerate covering large distances. It also went straight up. (Video taken)  Observer was standing in hisy driveway facing west when he first saw it.  When he last saw it, it was in the eastern sky.  It basically travelled the north in an arc around his position.  He first noticed the object due to the pulsating lights and the erratic movements.  It was also traveling incredibly fast.   Witness is confident that it was not an airplane or helicopter or blimp or any other flying object that he had ever seen. It was reportedly very high in the sky, appearing to be at an altitude of an airplane.  He lost sight of the object after it traveled to the eastern sky beyond his line of sight.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
