Rectangular configuration, no lights, haze or aura around it at high altitude.;2019-08-03 10:00:00;Few seconds;Rectangular configuration, no lights, haze or aura around it at high altitude. I was having coffee on the notth porch with our cat. I heard a helicoptor and looked up for it but it went around behind our house so i could not see it, as i Was looking up i saw a craft very high and further north Moving extremely slow.  From west to east.  It looked like an Plus sign with 2 parallel bars going one way and just 1 going the other.  The 3 bars were about the same length and had 3-D rectangular crossection.  They were positioned. at about 45 degs to the direction of travel, they had a haze or aura i looked away to my cat for a split second, and when i looked back it was gone.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
