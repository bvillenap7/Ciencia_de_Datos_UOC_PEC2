Bright lights in shape of a ball vanishes.;2020-03-31 06:30:00;20 seconds;Bright lights in shape of a ball vanishes. It was twilight, light enough to see off into the distance and the sky was clear (no clouds).  I was at mile marker 68 going east bound on the Indiana toll road.  I saw a big circle (basically a ball) of bright white lights, the brightest I’ve ever seen, in the air.  There were no wings, no red or green lights to indicate an air plane, and nothing around it.  It wasn’t like the lights you see in the air for a plane to see at night either.  As I approached and fixated on the object, the lights went off and it increased the altitude and was just gone.  The object left no trail.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
