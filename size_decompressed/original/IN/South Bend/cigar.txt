Long cigar shaped ufo near crescent moon;2018-05-10 07:00:00;40 seconds;Long cigar shaped ufo near crescent moon While observing the crescent moon just before sunrise under a clear blue sky on May 10, 2018, I spied a long white cigar shaped object moving across the sky.  It was just below the moon and moving fairly fast.  At first glance I thought it was a jet leaving a contrail.  I then thought that if it was indeed a jet, it appeared  very high up.  I then noticed that the shape of the object was not changing. When the object was directly below the moon it blinked out of view and immediately reappeared.  The object moved along for a few more seconds before vanishing again and did not seem to reappear.;41.6714363984674;-86.2510919540229
