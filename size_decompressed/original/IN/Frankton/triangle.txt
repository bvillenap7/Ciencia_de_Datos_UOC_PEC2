We seen a bright light in the distance and though it was just a plane.  When we approached the intersection on 700W and 1000N we noticed it was low,not moving, and the lights where not blinking.  As we got closer and closer we came to a dead stop in the middle of the road at the T (corner of 775w and 1000n), we got out of the car.  This craft was hovering approx. 50ft from the ground, over the cornfield, no further than 20ft from the road..  It was a perfect triangle no bigger than a V.W Sluggbug car.  It was Black(so black i thought in was staring into a black hole.), had 3 lights the tip of the triangle was white the other 2 corners where red.  We where freaking out because it was as calm as can be no noises, no motor, no fans, just pure silence, the corn was even still and not making noises from the air.  We tried tanking pictures but we couldn't get it on the phone it was so black.  So i turn my flash on and take maybe 10 pictures and still nothing showing up.  Next thing you know the lights on the craft started blinking off and on very slowly.  Then it just started rising into the air maybe 10 ft more and started to move east. we watched it get higher and farther heading towards Alexandria.  The worst part about this whole experience was the pure fear me and my friend felt next.  Like i said no wind as calm as can be.  We start to hear something hauling a$$ towards us from the cornfield, i mean this thing was breaking corn stalks we jumped in the car and never look back. craziest experience of my life!!;40.2263;-85.777
