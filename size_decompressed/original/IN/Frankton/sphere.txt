At 23:17 hours i was driving down 600N about to head to 100W when i looked out my window to the right to see what appeared to be a semi in the cornfield.   When i got closer i realized that it wasn't a semi but a sphere object hovering over the corn.  There were many flashing lights on it and it was spinning fairly fast.  The lights were yellow red and white and extremely bright.   When i pulled over to look, the object was gone.;40.2263;-85.777
