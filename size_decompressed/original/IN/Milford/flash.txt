Occasionally, we would see small towns set off fireworks, along the way. I saw a flash of light, assumed it was a firework, and waited for the noise. There wasn't a noise.  By the time I had realized that it wasn't a firework I saw whatever it was, flash again. This time it was much closer(Yes we were moving in a car but it moved too much of a distance in that time to be stationary). The next flash was directly beside our car. The flash occured about the same heighth as the top of a telephone pole(except the telephone poles were on the other side of the road). There still wasn't any sound. I looked behind the car antcipating the next flash which occured quite a distance from our car. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));41.4027;-85.8517
