neon green light like a comet shooting across the sky;2001-06-24 20:50:00;1-2 seconds;neon green light like a comet shooting across the sky witnessed a neon green colored light race across the sky in a northern line. I have never seen anything move as fast as this.  At first I thought it was a comet but it did not appear to be falling but shooting across the sky.  Lasted just a few seconds and it was gone.;39.7628;-86.5343
