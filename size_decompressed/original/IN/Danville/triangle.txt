The second I saw it I knew something was weird and didn't take my eyes off it.  The lights grew bigger and I realized it was coming closet so told my family to watch.  It was emitting beams of white light and slowly hovered over the road and it made no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
