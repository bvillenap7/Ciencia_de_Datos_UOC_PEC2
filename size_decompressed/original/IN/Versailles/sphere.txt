A friend and I were driving back from Ohio, when, just East of Versailles, IN, we saw a bright orange sphere, hovering approximately 1500 feet above the ground. It moved slowly from East to West across the field which it was above for about 15 seconds then disappeared.  10 seconds or so later, it reappeared, in about the same area in had vacated seconds before, moving slowly again across the sky, always staying below cloud level. Again, after 15 seconds or so, it disappeared. About a half a minute later, it reappearred, and brought with it a second craft, looking identical to the first, in size, color and shape.  They stayed a uniform distance from each other (150 feet?) while moving slowly across the sky for around 45 seconds, then disappeared.  That time when they left, it was as if you could feel them depart, and we knew they would not reappear to us again that night.;39.0471;-85.2234
