Small silver disc, Stationary in clear sky;2003-07-29 12:00:00;3 minutes;Small silver disc, Stationary in clear sky I was biking around 12:00.  I was on my way to a friends house, and the sky was clear.  So I was suprised to see a bright object in the sky (not the sun).  At first i thought it was a planet but it seemed too big and it also seemed that it was getting bigger.  I'm not sure though.  Also it wasn't white, it was silver.  I watched it while going down a sidewalk, so i was constantly looking at it and watching where i was going.  I went over a bump and the next time i looked up it was gone.  I stopped and looked for it for a couple minutes but i didn't see it.  So i continued to bike to my friends house. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) sorry i got the date wrong on the report (approx. 12:00pm) ((END)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sightings was July 29, 2003.  We have amended the date above.  PD));39.9573;-86.277
While driving a unidentifiable white light flew West and was out of sight as fast as it appeared.;2013-12-28 03:55:00;Seconds;While driving a unidentifiable white light flew West and was out of sight as fast as it appeared. I was headed West/North on the 865, right before the 65 interchange, and saw a ball of light fly overhead.  Clearly moving too fast to be helicopter and too low to be a plane.  Sky was very clear, could see many constellations.  There was several tractor trailers headed East/South that may have seen as well.  Emitted no sound and was gone as fast as it appeared.  This was just like another sighting earlier this year but the object headed  West this time and not North, same light same duration.;39.9573;-86.277
