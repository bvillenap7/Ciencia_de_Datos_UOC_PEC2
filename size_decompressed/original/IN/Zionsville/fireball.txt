Lights that looked like big balls of fire seen over Zionsville.;2005-03-21 20:40:00;several minutes;Lights that looked like big balls of fire seen over Zionsville. I was at work just south of Zionsville off of Zionsville road and was outside pumping fuel into a truck when I saw the lights appear.  First I saw one light appear then right next to that one I saw another one appear then next to those two I saw a third light appear and then I saw a fourth one appear obove the three but off to the left a little.  The lights were perfectly synchronized when they began to appear, the first one then about two seconds later the second and two seconds later the third and then the forth one was visable. The first three lights were all in a perfectly straight line and the fourth one was above them but offset a little. They did not move at all for about ten to twenty seconds then they just faded out. A couple of minutes went by and they began to appear again in the same fashion as they did the first time one right after the other except this time only three of the lights appeared, not four and they were visiable for about ten seconds then they also faded out. These lights were identical to the first ones I saw and were in the same area of the sky as the first ones. Immediately after the second appearance faded out I saw a faint white light from the exact spot of the sky where the last three lights faded out shoot across the sky at an incredible rate of speed heading east and it was gone.  These lights looked like big balls of fire in the sky, they didn't look anything like airplane lights plus they just sat there and didn't even move. It's nice to get on this web site and see that other people saw the same lights that night, now I know Im not going crazy.;39.9573;-86.277
