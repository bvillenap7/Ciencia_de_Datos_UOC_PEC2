UFO takes off and flies away in rural indiana near crash site.;2010-06-11 00:30:00;00:02:00;UFO takes off and flies away in rural indiana near crash site. Three of us were driving home on a wooded road, the woods open up to a clearing we are about 100 feet from the site of a bad car crash a day before.  We look out the right window and are shocked to see four bright lights in a row hovering about 50 feet in the air.  The lights flipped from horizontal to vertical in place then rose and flipped again so now it was upside-down, then it took off diagonally, not in a straight line but curved and flew off to the right. We stopped and the cars behind us stopped.  When it took off we kept driving away trying to figure out what we saw, I tried to take a video but it was too dark.;39.9573;-86.277
