I WILL NEVER FORGET. IT WAS A COLD FEBUARY NIGHT ,MY MOTHER AND I WERE DRIVING HOME FROM A MOVIE. I LOOKED OUT MY WINDOW TO WATCH THE MOON FOLLOW ME., WHEN I NOTICED THREE OBJECTS FLYING IN FORMATION. I DIDN'T THINK TO MUCH ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY HAD BLINKING RED AND GREEN LIGHTS LIKE AN AIRPLANE. WE CAME TO OUR ROAD TO GET HOME WE MADE A RIGHT TURN THE OBJECTS HAD VANISHED. WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT OVER A SUBDIVISION.IT LOOKED LIKE A HELICOPTER WITH A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT .I ROLLED MY WINDOW DOWN I HEARD NOTHING . SO WE CONTINUE HOME ABOUT 7 MILES.WHEN WE PULLED INTO THE DRIVE WAY I GLANCED TO THE NORTH AND THEY WERE THERE IN FORMATION AS I GOT OUT OF THE CAR I NOTICED I COULD HEAR NO SOUND THEY WERE SILENT BUT DIPPING INTO THE WOODS BEHIND OUR HOUSE UP AND DOWN BRIGHT LIGHTS OFF AND ON FOUR 10 MIN THEN THEY GOT BACK INTO FORMATION RED AND GREEN FLASHING LIGHTS AND TOOK OFF LIKE NOTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN.;39.5643;-86.0776
