Hovering green, blue, and yellow lights over a wooded area, landing, then taking off into the night sky.;1983-07-01 01:30:00;30 minutes;Hovering green, blue, and yellow lights over a wooded area, landing, then taking off into the night sky. I observed lights hovering over a wooded area about 1/2 mile away.  I was in an upstairs bedroom and had full view.  The lights which were green, blue and yellow, were then diminished but still could be seen.  I believe that whatever had been hovering over the wooded area landed.  I notified my stepfather and told him to look.  He did, but thought that it was a wrecker recovering a vehicle.  He later went back downstairs and I continued to watch the lights flashing.  Later I observed these lights hover again over this wooded area for about 10 seconds.  I then saw it shoot up into the sky faster than anything I had ever seen.  I was 13 at the time and I do still believe I saw something unidentified and can not be explained.  I never investigated the area where a Possible Landing occured, but I've always wondered what it was or what it was looking for.;40.5104;-85.8283
