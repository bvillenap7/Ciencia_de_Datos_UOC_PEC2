It was about 7pm. It was about 35 feet in diameter and was glowing red all over and extra brite on the bottom. it was hovering about 150 feet up in the air and had fast strobing lights on the top and bottom that were white. We kept driving because it was a terrifing event! It was not an air craft, it WAS a U.F.O! We dont want to get involved so no names but just thought you should know...;39.7682;-87.1978
