city in space and not ours;2009-06-23 04:00:00;15 seconds;city in space and not ours I got back from a show and looked up at the stars and saw a Huge round city sized UFO and a strange fire glow orange color seemed to lite it up as if it were STEALTHed and caught a ray of light somehow. This was a HUGE city sized craft and was in space up 50 miles overhead. The orange lite lit it up for about 10 to 15 seconds before it vanished, I ran inside to get my binoculars and scanned the whole sky and nothing. I told my wife about it and was very excited but I never reported it or said anything to anybody, about 3 nights later after another show about the same time I was looking up and so was my wife and it did the same thing again in the same way with the orange lite. as if it had never moved. This scared the hell out of both of us and we never said another word about it. I believe its a whole city that is STEALTHED and is only visible when the light catches it just right. I dont really care if anyone believes me , just thought I better report it.;39.7682;-87.1978
