Three lights were seen in the western sky three times over the course of fifteen minutes in and near Elwood, Indiana.;2005-03-21 20:35:00;a few seconds, three time;Three lights were seen in the western sky three times over the course of fifteen minutes in and near Elwood, Indiana. I was traveling north on State Road 37 on the evening of March 21, 2005.  Beginning at about 8:35, I saw three dark red lights in the west three times over the course of fifteen minutes.  They were slightly above eye level, hazy around their circumference but roughly circular and about the size of taillights seen from ten car lengths away.  The distance between them was the same as their diameter.  They didn't form any obvious geometric shape.  Each time they disappeared, they did so quickly but not instantly they didn't quite blink out, in other words.  I didn't hear anything unusual.  I wasn't sure if they were moving roughly with me or not moving at all. When I first saw the lights, I was about five miles south of the point where highways 37 and 13 merge.  The second time, I was about a mile from the spot where 37 crosses SP Street in southeastern Elwood.  When I saw them the third and last time, I was past Elwood, about a mile north of the 37/28 intersection.  The first sighting lasted about three seconds and was the longest of the three. I made a slightly more detailed (and much wordier) report to a site called UFO EVIDENCE about three weeks after the fact.  It's still up.  Googling UFO sighting Elwood, Indiana March 21, 2005 gets to it.  I've found seven very similar sightings that took place in north central Indiana at about the same time:  1.  west of Kokomo, 19:30, 2.  south of Lafayette, 20:30, 3.  north of Sheridan, 20:30, 4.  north of Zionsville, it seems, 20:40, 5.  southwest of Logansport, 21:00, 6.  northwest of Kokomo, 21:00, 7.  west of Kokomo, 21:30.  The first six are on the NUFORC site.  The seventh is on a site called HBCC UFO RESEARCH.  It has two sightings similar to mine, but one seems to be a second report by the same person of one of the six.;40.2838;-85.8393
