horizontal string of lights in the night.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-17 22:07:00;20 seconds;horizontal string of lights in the night Dark night, sitting on the bed on second floor, observed bright, deep red glowing round(possibly lights, possibly some sort of exhaust portals) hover past my upstairs window at approximately 1/16-1/8 mile off across a newly harvested farm field. I very quickly went from bed to window. The red lights appeared to be horizontally linear, quite a few. I opened the window and was dumbstruck by absolute silence. The craft came into sight initially from my left and moved slowly and silently to my right. I am not aware of any color as it was pitch dark. When I reached the window, it had already entirely crossed the field. My viewpoint was from the side only and it could have been oval or round or otherwise. I could not discern size from bottom to top. There is a neighboring long white barn with outside lights in the near distance behind my residence. The craft appeared to be between the barn and my residence. It appeared to be at least twice the length of the barn as it moved over the trees, turned slightly to the left and quietly hovered out of sight. The speed of the object did not appear to change. There was absolutely zero sound. I observed no other lights than those at the side. I determine the shape as saucer only because the linear lights did not change in length as it turned and disappeared over the nearby treeline. When it had passed I noticed all 3 of my pets were silently at my feet.  It is to be considered that Otis AFB is not a great distance from here however, I am not aware of that we are capable of absolutely silent flight.;40.2838;-85.8393
