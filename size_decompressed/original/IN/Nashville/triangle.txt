BRIGHT LIGHTED OBJECT, CLEARLY VISIBLE WITH THE NAKED EYE, HOVERING LESS THAN 100 YARDS ABOVE THE GROUND.;2007-02-10 21:00:00;10 MINUTES;BRIGHT LIGHTED OBJECT, CLEARLY VISIBLE WITH THE NAKED EYE, HOVERING LESS THAN 100 YARDS ABOVE THE GROUND. THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED IN THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF BROWN COUNTY, INDIANA, ON FEBRUARY 10, 2007.  IT WAS BETWEEN 8:30 AND 9:00 P.M. WHEN I STEPPED OUTSIDE TO RETRIEVE SOMETHING FROM MY CAR.  TAKE NOTE THAT THIS IS IN THE COUNTRY, AND A RESIDENCE WHERE I HAVE LIVED FOR OVER 6 YEARS.  I AM AN AVID STAR GAZER, AND MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE NIGHT SKY AND MY SURROUNDINGS THAN MOST MIGHT BE.  NOT TO MENTION THE SKY IS MUCH MORE DETAILED THAN LIVNG IN THE CITY.   I IMMEDIATLY NOTICED A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE SKY NOT 5 MILES AWAY, AND VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND.  IF I WERE TO DESCRIBE A STAR IN THE SKY AS THE SIZE OF A PENCIL DOT, THIS OBJECT WOULD, IN COMPARISON, BE A FOOTBALL.  IT HAD 3 WHITE LIGHTS, FORMING WHAT LOOKED LIKE A TRIANGLE, AND ONE RED LIGHT IN THE REAR.  NONE OF THESE LIGHTS WERE FLASHING.   I OBSERVED THE OBJECT THROUGH MY BINOCULARS, WHICH WERE IN ARMS REACH, JUST INSIDE THE DOOR, AND COULD CLEARLY SEE THE MOVEMENT OF THE OBJECT, WHICH SEEMED TO BE HOVERING, MOVING IN SPORADIC, SMOOTH MOVEMENTS CENTERING IN ONE LOCATION.  I YELLED FOR MY DAUGHTER AND BOYFRIEND TO COME SEE.  BOTH WITNESSED THIS AS WELL AS A NEIGHBOR, ONE RIDGE BEHIND ME.   I REACHED INSIDE AGAIN, ABOUT 7 OR 8 MINUTES LATER FOR A SECOND PAIR OF BINOCULARS, AND TURNED BACK AROUND TO FIND THE OBJECT GONE, WITHOUT A TRACE.;39.2367;-86.222
