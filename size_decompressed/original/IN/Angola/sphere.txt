Two white spheres flying through sky at incredible speeds.   ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-22 03:45:00;5 minutes;Two white spheres flying through sky at incredible speeds. I was walking to my house when I looked up at the sky and saw a weird flying object. It looked like two white spheres that weren't connected but were flying right behind each other at the same speed.  They were just slowly starting to tilt higher up and started flying upwards almost vertically.  I thought it was just a plane or rocket, but it didn't have any wings and we don't launch rockets anywhere near hear.  It also only happens once a month or so, I hope this helps you and you can figure it out soon.;41.6524;-85.0142999999999
