4 lights flying in formation;2009-03-15 20:05:00;1 - 2 seconds;4 lights flying in formation I looked up in a southeast direction, standing on my front porch.  I saw 4 diffused lights flying in a backwards v formation, 3 on one side, 1 on the other.  They maintained spacing between each other.    Moved quickly across the sky, no sound.  Incident lasted approx 2 seconds.   Lights bigger in size than a star, probably 20 times bigger than a star visually appears.   Each light appeared to be a different size.
