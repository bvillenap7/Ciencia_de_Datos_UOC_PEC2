Tire shaped object sighted in the woods of indiana had no lights and moved with purpose.;1997-09-15 20:00:00;about 3 minutes;Tire shaped object sighted in the woods of indiana had no lights and moved with purpose. About 8 pm i stopped at a spot on the way home where a pair of great horned owls were nesting. i made this stop many time throughout the summer to watch them. i had a series one night optic that i use on my boat. When i parked i started to setup my watch point when there was a crashing noise from deep in the woods south of my possion. at first i thought it was a tree falling but very quickly there after a tire shaped dark form rose above the trees. it rotated from a vertical axess to a horizontal, hovered for about two minutes then moved of and up at a increasing speed. finally dissapearing into the clouds south east at i guess about twenty thousand feet. The object while in sight with naked eye and optic showed what i would describ as a hubcap dom on top rised slightly above the side wall of a tire. the side wall had several small projections. the tread area were what could have been ports or windows. all along the tread area were tubes or piping boxish and roundish projections. the next after noon when i got off work i went into the woods and after some searching found a slop busted into the pines where this object had been on edge down to the ground. the crash i heard must have come from a temperat tree which had a very large limb fresh busted. The object was about thirty to forty feet across and maybe twenty feet thick. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));41.6524;-85.0142999999999
It was no crafts from this world.;2016-07-30 23:45:00;30 minutes;It was no crafts from this world I witnessed 25+ balls that were red and yellow....no blinking lights.  The only way I can discribe this event was as if you were watching musical lines and the balls were notes.   Someone was cranking the handle on the lines and the balls fastened to them moved in a procession.  Never speeding up...never slowing down...never going up...and never going down.   And after they passed me by....they shimmered....winked....and vanished!   Then, I SAW some of the balls that had NO lights and if you were not looking for them...you couldn't see them.   I have cell photo.   I'm a long haul trucker, and this is a new one on me.  I was thinking while I was watching them, No one is gonna believe me.   That's when I went OH!!!  WHY AM I NOT FILMING THIS!!??  So....I did  (I cant seem to send the video);41.6524;-85.0142999999999
Bright green light falling in south sky;2020-11-04 05:30:00;2 seconds;Bright green light falling in south sky While traveling south on US 69 a bit south of Angola Indiana I saw a green light falling at an angle from left to right.  This light was in the south sky.  It was moving quickly and faded out after 1 or 2 seconds.  It did not appear to have any kind of tail.  I donâ€™t think it was a shooting star as it was bright green and appeared closer than falling stars I have seen in the past.;41.6524;-85.0142999999999
