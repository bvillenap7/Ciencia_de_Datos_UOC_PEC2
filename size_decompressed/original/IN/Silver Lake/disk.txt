I let me dog out and after a few minutes she starts barking frantically, which she normally does not do.   I go out and she is standing at the end of her leash, on her hind legs barking at an object in the sky.   It was across the lake above the tree line and very bright making a woo, woo, woo sound, high pitched.   It had white lights on the bottom and a dome on top that was pulsating red. It moved slowly and would stop, them move and stop and then it just disappeared.   There was no trees in it's path and the sky was crystal clear. In fact the moon was very bright that night.  Once it disappeared my dog was fine and went inside.;41.0763;-85.8808
