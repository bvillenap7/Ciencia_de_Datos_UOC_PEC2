As my wife and I sat in our garage just after midnight we noticed one particularly bright light in the sky at about 60 degrees in the sky from our vantage point.  We didn't think much of it until it had been there for well into 20 minutes.  We began watching it and comparing it to its location above the neighbors house to the east for matter of reference. During the time we watched this light we saw it zig back and forth in the sky.  While it did not move around a tremendous amount, the movement was still noticeable.  Also, at times the light would pulsate slowly, rarely changing from a white light to red then back to white. After watching this light move for nearly an hour we looked southeast and discovered another light in the shy that also was moving erratically in the sky.  The first light we saw moved toward in the sky to nearly 80 degrees and became noticing dimmer as time went on. We live in a flight path for one of the busiest airports in the US and are very accustomed to airplanes flying over.  This hovered in the same general area for over an hour, moving in multiple directions during that time. We couldn't stand to be out in the cold any longer and decided to come inside before either light went out of view or disappeared.;41.3098;-87.0362
