Two very large cylinders side by side;2005-03-09 17:00:00;about 3 to 5 seconds;It was about 4 pm today when a few military jets flying south west and very low altitudes went right over our house.  Then about an hour later I heard a helicopter coming from the south west , as i watched it go right over me , it was pretty high and going to the North East ,  I seen an object like nothing i have ever seen before ! It looked like two very large cylinders side by side with like a cloud around it or like a mist , but i could still see the object moving off to the northeast very fast . It was partly cloudy but was in a blue part of the sky , I could only see it for about 3 to 5 seconds , it was very high in the sky .;39.4042;-86.5779
