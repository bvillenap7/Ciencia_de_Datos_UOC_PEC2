It just looked strange;2004-07-17 21:00:00;15 sec;It just looked strange I was going to the store , and had stopped at the stop sign and i seen a small blue light way off to the north , and then in no time the object was almost right on top of me , then i seen a green light to the right of the center of the object , and then what i seen next freaked me out , it was a huge flying rectangle and it was all black , it was so big and only about 200 to 300 feet off the ground . Just before it went over my car I opened my door really fast and heard the sound of it's engine , so it sounded like a plane , but it sure didn't look like one , at lest no plane i have ever seen . When i got to the store , and there was a guy working outside and he seen it too , he told me he thought it was going to crash . So you can see just how low it was . Can you guys there at mufon find out if there was some kind of military training going on that night ? If anyone else seen it please let me know.;39.4042;-86.5779
