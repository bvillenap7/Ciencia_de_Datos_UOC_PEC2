Bright orange ball moving slowly;2009-10-31 18:00:00;1 minute;Bright orange ball moving slowly I don't know the exact time but I was driving east in chesterton Indiana. It was around 6 to 7 at night.  It was still light out. I saw a orange ball above the tree line.  I have lived in town for over twenty years. The orange ball was large and looked like a perfect circle.  It looked like the light was above 80/94 highway.  The light was stationary then started moving below the tree line.  It wasn't the sun or any advertising signs.  I have never seen anything like it before.  It saw it for less than a minute.  This is twice in one year I have seen lights I can't explain.  I placed a report in August of this year.  I wanted to let you know I looked every night for a week after sighting and it was not there again.  So I know it wasn't a star or planet.  This object I observed with my binoculars changed in sequence to four different colors in a pattern. This was the August sighting.  I didn't want to report the orange ball because I was afraid no one woul! d believe me since I had posted a different sighting in August.  Then I saw that someone in Indy and Chicago saw a simular thing. Many people had to have seen this orange ball. It was right over a very major highway in and out of Chicago.  Thanks.;41.6133;-87.0446000000001
