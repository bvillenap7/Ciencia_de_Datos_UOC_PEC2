light moving across sky fades then comes back on.;2003-06-21 10:00:00;10 SECONDS;light moving across sky fades then comes back on. One light up very high moving from south to north very fast.  The light faded to nothing then the light came back on while it was moving.  Went from horizon to horizon.  Never seen any light like it before.  Not a plan don't think it was a shooting star. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the sighting occurred during evening hours, and we have amended the time above accordingly.  We further suspect that the witness may have observed a disposed missile shell tumbling in orbit.  PD));41.6133;-87.0446000000001

Then it kept slowly moving to the west.  It was a long way off.  It looked like it moved up and down and then would move back to the east.  Am on flight path of Midway airport and see lots of jets all of the time.  Not a jet.  It finally went behind a tree and was gone.  Just wondering if anyone else saw the same thing.  It was in the south part of the sky. Thanks;41.6133;-87.0446000000001

While stargazing at Indiana Dunes State Park, we witnessed a star moving across the sky at a high rate of speed.  It curved southbound and faded in and out.   Twelve minutes later we witnessed a northbound star traveling at a high rate of speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not provide a time of the sighting, so we have assigned an arbitrary time.

Orange ball of light;2020-08-08 21:30:00;2 minutes;Orange ball of light There was a large orange/red ball of light traveling south to north. It was not flashing. Just a solid ball of light. It was flying somewhat low, about as low as a commercial plane would fly. It was traveling in a straight line and did not disappear at any time.  There was no sound associated with it either.;41.6133;-87.0446000000001
two lights circling in a figure 8;2021-05-13 23:30:00;15 minutes;two lights circling in a figure 8 Two lights were circling in the shape of a figure 8. They would intersect at the top the 8, at the mid point of the 8, and at the bottom of the 8 in synchronization. This continued for 15-20 minutes and was witnessed and/or filmed by 5 family members. While we were going in and out of the house to get phones to take video or check social media for reports from others, the lights disappeared. We were also checking other websites to see what aircraft or military planes were overhead and found nothing. There was no sound, or wind during the sighting or other aircraft lights. The sky was overcast and the lights appeared to come from above the clouds as there were no beams of light shining up from the ground, and appeared over a wooded area right across from our home. There were no other neighbors out and no reports of anything on social media. We were going to call the non emergency number for the police but thought the lights would be gone by the time they got! here and they would think we were all crazy.;41.6133;-87.0446000000001
