((anonymous));2019-05-07 20:52:00;15 seconds;Absolutely still object, very large, hovering so close over trees above all street lights, silent, 2 massive bright white lights one on each side parallel, absolutely not a plane or jet of any sort never seen anything like it in my 38 years.  Small flashing lights noticed on back side , it caught my attention so I stopped and watched and it so quickly took off straight ahead into the night out of sight I turned around my car to follow it and it was gone ,  it didn’t leave at blazing speed like something from out of space technology it certainly wasn’t normal and went from a dead stop to just taking off and gone within seconds,  not a helicopter not like anything I’ve seen absolutely has me stumped to where I had to check to see if there was anything else reported and first time on the site figured I’d put something up there see what the masses says, notice a lot of reports lately in Indiana.  I drove around in circles not a trace in the sky, with a plane ! you can notice it for such along time flying overhead this just literally disappeared, clear night clouds not a reason, was so low clouds wouldn’t have mattered anyways .  God bless keep our eyes on the skies there’s something going on out there.  Stay with Jesus and pray. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
