Got my camera so I could enlarge. Put on night mode (Samsung Galaxy 4).  Once enlarged I could make out the shape and lights much clearer.  Disc shape with top and bottom domes.  I also saw what looked like little stars or balls of light around it coming and going (almost reminded me of swarming mosquitoes), one turned a bright red for just a second.  Kept moving in a line further away until I could not see anymore (took about an hour from when I first noticed it).   Disappeared out of sight or went behind trees I could not tell which happened first. Lucky to see it by about 12:40 it became overcast in our area.;39.6903;-86.6682
