I was enroute to my residence from work at approximately 23:15 hours.  I noticed what appeared to be airplane lights (wing tip red and green) in the night sky to my left (east).  However, I then noticed that the green light was angled downward and appeared to be decending.  I was approximately eight miles north of Francesville, IN at the time.  I continued to watch these two lights.  As I got closer to Francesville, the lights got lower.  As I pulled into town, I observed these lights to be approximatly 100 to 150 feet above ground.  What I had first thought to be one green light was, in fact, a multitude of green lights on the front of the craft.  The craft appeared to be approximatly four (4) stories in height and was approximatly two (2) blocks long.  What had appeared to be a red light was an apparent exhaust port and appeared to be approximately fifty (50) feet wide.  There appeared to be some type of structure on the outer shell of the craft, however, I could not tell for sure.  This craft stopped and hovered over Francesville, IN for approximately five (5) minutes.  There was absolutely no sound.  After approximately five (5) minutes the object angled upward by approximately one or two degrees and continued on a westerly course toward Rensselaer, Jasper County, IN.
