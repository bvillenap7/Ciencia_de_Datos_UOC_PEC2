We, myself and 5 other friends, were having a bonfire at a friend's house. We noticed one light moving up and down behind the trees and above them. It would disappear and reappear rapidly. Suddenly, other lights and crafts appeared, one with a beam of light coming from it forming a path across the sky. Two lights or crafts chased another across the sky. One craft flew above us and there were red lights and white lights and a strange, foreign humming and whizzing sound. It did not have wings and could not have been a plane. There was lots of activity and strange lights everywhere. They moved fast and disappeared unlike planes or other aircraft. They moved irregularly.;40.7494;-86.0686
