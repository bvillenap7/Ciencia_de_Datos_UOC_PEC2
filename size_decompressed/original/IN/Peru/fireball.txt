I was sitting outside on the evening of 7/22/08 and noticed a very bright white light breaking through the clouds. Four orange balls formed a satellite around the white light then moved off in different directions moving through the clouds. The orange fireballs moved back to the brighter light and moved out farther yet again. This went on for about 22 minutes with the lights converging several times to the stationary bright white light. We have quite a few aircraft that fly close to our house, however these objects did not have the sound or jet trails that we would normally see or hear associated with aircraft. This was witnessed by 3 people as well as me. 2 of the observers are former military personnel and had no explanation for what the lights could have been.;40.7494;-86.0686

IT LASTED ABOUT 10 SECONDS, AND THEN BURNED OUT CLOSE TO THE GROUND.   IT WAS BRIGHT WHITE, WITH NO DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS.   I HAVE RARELY SEEN A FALLING FIREBALL IN THE SKY.;40.7494;-86.0686
