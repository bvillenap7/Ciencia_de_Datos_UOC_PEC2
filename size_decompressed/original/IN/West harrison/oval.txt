Enormous thick black oval hovering above a tree;2008-03-19 16:00:00;30mins;Enormous thick black oval hovering above a tree Probably irreverent due to it being over tens years ago but i randomly kept searching for what I saw on the internet and finally found this website.. I was traveling down I-74 towards Cincinnati around 3pm with my boyfriend, his cousin and girlfriend along with my daughter.  We got onto the interstate and not long after, we came up to cars lined up on the side of the highway for as far as you could see, miles of cars. There were hundreds of people looking up towards the sky. In an open field above a tall tree right beside the road there was an ENORMOUS thick black oval just hovering in the sky, it was at least 20ft wide.  I took pictures with my old phone for evidence.  We stood and watched it for over thirty mins it was so odd and out of place. I’ve seen smoke rings and this was not that.  It looked as if someone took a gigantic sharpie and drew a circle in the sky above this tree.  It was certainly not of this world. We finally stared to drive away and every so slowly counter clockwise it started to disappear.   This has crossed my mind thousands of times over the past ten years the curiosity of what I saw is baffling. I’d love to know what it was or where to it came from.  I feel blessed to have seen something so cool.;39.3017;-84.8850000000001
