Red Orbs rousing my dog and moving on my property.;2007-06-19 03:30:00;10 minutes;Red Orbs rousing my dog and moving on my property. Waken up by my dog who was really worked up barking and jumping around, I grabbed my pistol after failed attempts to quell her vocally and went into the dining room where my dog was at the patio door going crazy,and saw two blood red orbs about 4 acres from house.   I watched them bank right in tandem like fighter jets do and follow a gravel road on our property and disappear into the dark.  They were flying at about 100ft and about 10 miles an hour. I tried to tell myself that what I had seen was a State Police helicopter looking for marijuana with infrared lights, but I knew better because, being decorated, and had served in three branches of the military especially as an Infantryman, that those craft are not silent and have major prop wash.  And whats up with the 3:30AM deal?   I believe that aliens are really Demons/Falling  ((sic.  Fallen)) Angels.;38.6146;-85.5184
