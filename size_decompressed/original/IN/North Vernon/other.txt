Plane like with two white lights and one red.  2 hours of same route in sky, varying speeds;2016-10-03 20:30:00;90 minutes;Plane like with two white lights and one red.  2 hours of same route in sky, varying speeds The object looked like a plane, but when it went around in a small area taking the same route for over an hour I started to wonder if it really were a plane.  It looks smaller than a plane and for its location in the sky doesn’t seem right.  It has two white lights that continuously blink and one red light that blinks off and on.  It continues to take the same strange route in the sky for almost two hours now.  It started out very slow moving and speeds up and then slows down.   I have seen something similar to this exactly two years ago with some friends and we couldn’t figure it out but it was definitely not a plane.;39.0021;-85.6270000000002
