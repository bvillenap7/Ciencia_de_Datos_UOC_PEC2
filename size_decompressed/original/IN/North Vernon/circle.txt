Round shape with a dip in the top and bottom;2004-03-28 19:00:00;3 hours;Round shape with a dip in the top and bottom The object is round with one dip in the top and one dip in the bottom, with something sticking up in the middle of the top dip. It appears to the naked eye as a real bright object, but with the close up view of a video camera, it takes the above described shape.  It appears every night at the same time (around 7 pm) in the eastern sky, then moves into the western sky (around 8 pm) and leaves at the same time (around 10 pm).  I noticed the first one in the sky in the year 2000, it appeared to be shooting red beams of light straight out from it, at times. Then a few months ago I started seeing this one that appears to be keeping the same time schedule and has the similar shape.  I have told people about it and most don't believe me. I am not the only one that has seen this and I just recently took another video of it and shown it to people.;39.0021;-85.6270000000002
