My wife and I witnessed an orange fireball in the sky moving from the south to the north and turning to the west only to disappear from sight.  The whole event only lasted about 1 to 2 minutes, however, could have been longer as we happen just to come out of the house at that time only catching a brief glimpse.  This is rural Indiana and mostly farms, so someone around here had a way better view of this thing, as we live in dense wooded area and view was semi obstructed.
