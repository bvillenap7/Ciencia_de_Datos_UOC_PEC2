This is the 6th or 7th time we have seen what ever it is hover over our house...it's triangular shaped and is gun metal gray about the size of minivan (know color cause we had flashlight that we had on it has it hovered over house).  We have seen this THING in several location now but only at night.  Been tiring to see if there surveying or something in our area but can't seem to find any reports.   Tonight's sighting, I had my camera ready and it was to far away to get clear photo (but working on getting a clear shot).  It does have a very low humming noise that we can hear in house so we know when it's close.  It has 2 red lights and 2 white lights...I feel silly honestly filling this out but have never seen anything like it and now with us seeing it so many times in the last month it has us both curious as hell I won't lie ...I'm 47 my spouse is 55 we have lived here for 22 years and have never seen such a thing ...wondering if not a drone except for the size j! ust to do the sound of it .... ok thank you for your time hopefully will find some report on what's it is;39.61;-84.9125
