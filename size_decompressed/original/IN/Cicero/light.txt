We were driving down a country road at about 10:30 at night heading south. We saw a light red or peach colored object in the sky. It looked as if it was next to a couple of cell phone towers in the city of Noblesville. It then moved northeast a little ways. We then turned onto a road going west and the object was gone.;40.128;-86.0428
