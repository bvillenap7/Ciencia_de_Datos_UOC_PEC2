While driving on St. Rd 19 in Cicero, Indiana, I noticed an extremely bright oval shape in the sky.  It was just hovering from the time I noticed it for about a minute.  It then moved to the west before rapidly becoming a pinpoint and disappeared.  The brightness never changed, just the size of the object until I couldn't see it.   From the time the object moved until I couldn't see it anymore was a couple of seconds.;40.128;-86.0428
