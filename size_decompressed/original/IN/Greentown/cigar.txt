Orange cigar shaped object;1997-12-01 22:00:00;20 seconds;Orange cigar shaped object I was driving home from a friends house when suddenly flash of light caught my eye up in the south western sky. The object was bright orange, cigar shaped, stationary, and sitting at a 45 degree angle in the sky. A area of roughly 100 yards across below it was lit up in a orange light also, almost like the light from a street light. I stopped my truck in the road and stared at it for 20 seconds. The temperature outside was 25 below 0, the wind was coming out of the west at 17 m.p.h. Suddenly the light just went out, and I saw nothing more of the object. It wasn't a plane, it wasn't ball lightning, and it wasn't a firework. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));40.4778;-85.9505
