A diamond shaped craft with 4 bright lights - 1 at each corner - moving silently, at great speed - seen in NW Ind. on  04-04-01 @ 11:30;2001-04-04 23:30:00;30 seconds;A diamond shaped craft with 4 bright lights - 1 at each corner - moving silently, at great speed - seen in NW Ind. on  04-04-01 @ 11:30 On 4-4-01 at approximately  11:30 p.m., I saw a very bright light in the east sky traveling straight west.  It passed almost directly over me & continued in a straight westward line until the trees obscured it from view.  The light was like a motorcycle headlight - single, not double as an airplane's.  There was no accompanying jet noise or airplane motor noise - only a soft afterhum - like a furnace running, or wind through trees.  This craft did not have red and green lights.  I saw 4 distinct lights arranged in a diamond shape (or a triangle with a tail).  There was also the suggestion of a few smaller lights around the back of the craft.  The front and rear lights were cream colored, while the side lights were amber and chartreuse.  It was travelling rapidly - from initial sighting to the point where I lost it in the trees took less than 30 seconds and the approximate distance I would estimate to be 3/4 mile.  The sky around my farm usually has many moving lights - all attached to regular aircraft.  The traveling speed of this craft astonished me, making me realize that it was not one of the regulars.  Background info:  I'm a retired Chicago teacher (35 years) and live on a small farm with dogs, cats, 3 sheep, 1 goat, and 1 horse.  I study dressage, ballet, spinning, weaving, and read in my spare time.  I hope that this report is clear and that the background info is what you wanted. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found her to be a seemingly quite credible, sober-minded witness.  She reported that the object passed over her head, covering some 160 degrees (est.) of arc, in the 30 seconds she witnessed the object.  We do not believe that the object could have been a plane, in light of that fact.  The witness reported that it was totally silent.  PD));41.538;-86.8996
