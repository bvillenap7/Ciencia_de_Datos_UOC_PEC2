Cigar shaped craft - similar sighting listed in same area;1979-07-15 14:00:00;about 5-6 minutes;Cigar shaped craft - similar sighting listed in same area This happened when I was about 9 years old.   I was standing behind my dad's house in Fairmount, Ind., looking to the NW/W.   I witnessed 2 cigar shaped objects slowly moving/hovering in the sky.  It was funny because I thought that they looked like the spaceship that Marvin the Martian flew in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  Since I was just a kid, I always dismissed this incident until I read another post about a cigar shaped sighting in Yorktown Ind. around the same time.  Yorktown isn't very far from Fairmount (about 25 miles).  I know that is story isn't very exciting, but I thought it was interesting that it was similar to something someone else saw in the same area.   So ... you never know.  Just thought that I would share. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.4147;-85.6779
