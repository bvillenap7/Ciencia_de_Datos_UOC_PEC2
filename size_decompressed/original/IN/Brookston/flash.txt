4 bright orange flashes in a line;2004-03-21 21:20:00;15-20 sec;4 bright orange flashes in a line 4 bright, yellow/orange flashes, fairly spaced apart, appear in the eastern horizon.   Each flash lasted 3-5 sec.  There were about 1/2 sec intervals between each flash.   Flashes appeared 2-4 times larger and brighter than the planet Venus in the sky.   While lit, the flashes made no appearent movement.  Flashes would start out dim and grow brighter then, fade off.  Flashes seemed to follow a line in the sky.

They often give off pulses of light, although the color of the light is white.  PD));40.5996;-86.8802
