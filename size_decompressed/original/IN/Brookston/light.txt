This time we had witnesses!  We were watching the Full Lunar Eclipse in the front yard with our neighbors, their 2 children, our two children, my husbands parents and his aunt.  The lights first appeared to the left of the mood and almost completely to the east.  My husband and I recognized them immediately as the same lights we had seen in March.  The lights came on one at a time then went off in the same pattern they came on in.  About 5-10 minutes after they first appeared, they came on again further north.  They came on and went off in succession again.  Then a 3rd time they appeared as they had before, further north this time.  After the 3rd display, we thought we heard a sonic bomb and a military jet fly by at a very high speed.  They appeared to be 30-40 degrees above the horizon and a few miles away.  They were yellow/orange.  Sometimes smaller lights came on around the main lights, sometimes they didn't.  They appeared to be moving north northwest.;40.5996;-86.8802
3rd Sighting of 3 Sightings from March 2003 - April 2004 - Yellow/Orange Lights in Formation;2004-04-16 20:50:00;10 minutes;3rd Sighting of 3 Sightings from March 2003 - April 2004 - Yellow/Orange Lights in Formation 3rd Sighting of 3 from March 2003 - April 2004.  My husband and I were returning home from dinner when he noticed these lights again.  This time they were very close to the ground - probably within a mile from us.  By the time he said There's those lights again! and I ducked to look thru the drivers side window, I saw 3 very large yellow/orange orbs with about 3 smaller lights around the outside of the larger ones.  From what I saw, they were in a triangular pattern.  However, my husband was able to see them better out the drivers window.  He said what he saw was 4 lights with the smaller lights on the outside of them.  He also saw a much larger light above these lights which appeared to be closer than the other 4.  The smaller 4 lights seemed to come on at the same time then the larger light came on.  When the larger light came on, the other 4 lights faded.  We were only a couple of miles from home.  We drove slowly trying to see them again but didn't.  When we pulled into our driveway, I got out of the vehicle as my husband was pulling it into the garage. I looked behind me just in time to see 3 large yellow orange lights in a horizantal line about 10-20 degrees above the horizon.  They came on from left to right and faded from left to right in a period of a few seconds.  We waited to see them again, but didn't see them again that night.  As I've stated before - this was the 3rd sighting in a years time in this same area.;40.5996;-86.8802

I saw a moving light way up in the  Northwestern sky.   It appeared to arc upward then was gone.   I did notice an airplane coming out of the west right after.   I have never seen just one light like I saw, especially one that disappeared as like leaving the Earth’s atmosphere.   I thought it was a plane till I saw it just vanish.   I really hope that what I saw was a UFO.   I couldn’t make out any shape since the craft was so high up.;40.5996;-86.8802
