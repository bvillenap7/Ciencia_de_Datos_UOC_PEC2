Fast moving metallic oval object over Brookston, IN;2010-06-10 20:53:00;2 minutes;Fast moving metallic oval object over Brookston, IN While sitting on my mother-in-law's deck, I saw an oval-shaped object traveling SouthWest The sun was gleaming off of the craft. It was very metallic like silver. There were no vapor trails at all so it must have been traveling at a lower altitude. I did not see any kind of wings or a tail at all. It eventually disappeared into the horizon. I am an USAF veteran.  Since having being in the military I know to observe all the details.  This may have been a classified aircraft that I am not familiar with. I sure didn't look terrestrial.;40.5996;-86.8802
