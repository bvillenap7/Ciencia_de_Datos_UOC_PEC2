They were tinted red, and have been seen around my town. Also, something identical was spotted other Pheonix. I'm 12 years old and I had ridden my bicycle to my friend's home. It became too dark to ride home, so my friend's father took me home. While riding in the back of the truck with my friend and his sister. My friend said Hey look! A UFO! I thought he was kidding, but when I turned, I realized he really saw something. The object(s) were in a curve, following the pattern of shining, fading, disappearing, and reappearing. The next day at school, I discovered another friend saw it also. Please notify me by e-mail ONLY.;38.1753;-87.8008
