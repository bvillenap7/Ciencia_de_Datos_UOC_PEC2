Bright round or oval dots moving in straight line over Wayne Co., IN.  ((NUFORC Note:  String of Space Link satellites.  PD));2019-05-25 22:50:00;~8-9 minutes;Bright round or oval dots moving in straight line over Wayne county indiana   , 2 flights  one after the other. I first saw a falling star.  I thought I might see some more so I looked up for a few more seconds.  I thought I was seeing one but then noticed one following it, followed by another and so on, New they  couldn't be  falling stars.  They seemed to be traveling at regular intervals in a straight line.  Bright, a few brighter or somewhat larger than others, seemed to be very high possibly Going through some high clouds at times and moving very fast.  I was considering not reporting this but I believe I have witnessed something rare.  P.S,  The falling star was moving east to north the objects were moving west to east. Hope some one else saw them.

I was outside at work and happened to look up at the sky.  I saw a white light that was way too low to be a plane or street light.  It moved very quickly from left to right in a fast diagonal movement.  The light disappeared after it moved.;39.8334597402597;-84.8984610389609
