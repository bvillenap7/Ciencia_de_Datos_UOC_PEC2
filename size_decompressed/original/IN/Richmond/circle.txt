Multiple red round objects grouped in a v shaped form appeared moving across the sky then dissapeared into nowhere;2013-06-22 22:30:00;15-20 seconds;multiple red round objects grouped in a v shaped form appeared moving across the sky then dissapeared into nowhere 	 I live in Richmond, IN 47374. I witnessed something last night i am unable to comprehend. 	On the night of June 22, 2013 at approximatly 10:30 pm i noticed a group of 5 to 7 red round shaped objects in a staggered v shape followed by 2 more of the same isolated objects.   I apologize for not counting exactly how many there were but i assure you it was 5 or 7 in the first group.  I was somewhat taken back by what i was witnessing.  They appeared at the south horizon just above a tree line.  They traveled at what seemed to be a slow rate of speed northeast toward an almost full moon.   They then began to dissapear individually about fifteen seconds after they appeared to me.   These objects did not move in an abrupt fashion or shift in any way but in a linear motion. 	This account took place as i was sitting om my girlfriends front porch patio.   I'm an avid star gazer so naturally i was staring at the sky while my girlfriend went inside to grab her sons overnight bag for him. His grandfather was sitting in his truck in the driveway facing north bound. I  noticed the objects and stood up to get a better look at the event and in awe just pointed at the sky, speechless! As the group shaped in the v pattern began to dissapear Missy, my girlfriend walked out of the front door onto the patio. She noticed me pointing at the sky and cuaght sight of the two objects that followed. They then began to fade into the night sky. At first i thought that they had dissapeared behind cloud cover but after further investigation i realized the sky was very clear with no visible clouds. 	Im not sure what i witnessed but i can tell you that ive never seen anything like it before in my life. After discussing the event with Missy i decided to notify someone of the event. I tried to figure out a logical explanation for what i had seen but was unable to. I  wanted so badly to find out if others had seen the same thing so when i woke up the following morning after a restless night of sleeping i immeditely looked in the paper and browsed the internet for other sightings. I then chose to call the National UFO sighting hotline. I truley hope that others will come forward and tell there stories of the same event if they witnessed this unexplained event. Im willing to testify to what i seen.;39.8334597402597;-84.8984610389609
Orangey spheres over the north end of glenn miller park in Richmond, Indiana.;2014-03-10 20:00:00;20 minutes;Orangey spheres over the north end of glenn miller park in Richmond, Indiana. I was laying in bed and saw an unusual flashing light in the north.  I got up and saw 3 or 4 folowing it.  The color was a orange.   As the event went on more and more came over a hill in the northwest section of glenn miller park traveling east but remaining north.   I went outside with my roommate there was no sound. the shape was round and some of them had a red glow.  The event seemed timed and somewhat in formation.  Never had seen anything like it.;39.8334597402597;-84.8984610389609
