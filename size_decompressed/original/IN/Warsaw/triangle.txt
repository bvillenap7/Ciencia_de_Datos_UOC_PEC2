Triangle ship in Indiana.;1994-06-15 02:00:00;2 minutes;Triangle ship in Indiana My friend andIi were riding motorcycles after work one night, and stopped for a smoke as we usually did.  All of a sudden from the west, we saw three small lights about treetop level coming at us across a field.  We sat on our bikes and watched as it got closer.  It finally got close enough to see it was one craft with 3 lights on the bottom.  We could make out it was triangular in shape and about 100 feet long and about 100 feet wide at the back.  It moved real slow, probably 5-10 miles per hour, never made a sound.  We could make out windows towards the front, but could not see inside.  It was so low we could have hit it with a rock.  I had the feeling that whoever was inside had seen us.  It kept on traveling to the east, rising up to go over the next set of trees.  After that we went home for the night.;41.2655217821782;-85.8535465346533
