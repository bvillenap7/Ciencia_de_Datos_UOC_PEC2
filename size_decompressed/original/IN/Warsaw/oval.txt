She also saw and we were frightened. Then we came to the living room and opened the window blinds.  From there, it was very clear.  We saw a bright oval shaped cloud circling my apartment in very definite pattern and speed.  We saw it for few minutes and could not dare to go out.  Then we came back to the bed room and from here also we could see this thing for few minutes.  It was so frightening that I could not have an idea to take my phone and capture this event.  After approximately 15 minutes of circling, it vanished.  We did not hear any sound.;41.2655217821782;-85.8535465346533
