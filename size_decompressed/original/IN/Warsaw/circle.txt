My Husband (driving),  our nine year old daughter,  two small sons and I were driving South on St. Rd. 15 on a return trip from Goshen;2008-07-24 22:00:00;35 min.;My Husband (driving),  our nine year old daughter,  two small sons and I were driving South on St. Rd. 15 on a return trip from Goshen Indiana at around10:20 P.M.  We were about 2 miles from Warsaw, Indiana when I noticed 2 objects off to the Southwest  that  were spaced much farther apart than the lights on an airplane wing.  These lights were round and were moving Southwest on a very clear night.  My Husband dismissed them as air planes due to the proximity of the local airport.  I talked him into turning down a side road to the West in the direction of the 2 orange lights.   Approximately 3/4 of a mile down this road we saw another object lower to the tree line to our Southwest. This object, the same as the first two appeared as a round, orange  complete circle moving / hovering South.  We turned South and then back to the West and found a clearing with a wide view of the horizon.  It was around 11P.M.  With the car off we sat in the entrance of a field facing to the South.  Within 5 minutes we were witnesses to an amazing display of these objects.  First a cluster of 2 appeared,  stationary to the South and then disappeared, one appeared just to the East, two reappeared again and then three more to the West of the other three for a total of six round orange objects in the Southwestern sky.  It seemed as though the objects were communicating to one another.  All the objects were stationary at this time of our observation. At this point a small panic ensued in our car and we left the area amazed, excited and feeling our world as a much smaller place.;41.2655217821782;-85.8535465346533
