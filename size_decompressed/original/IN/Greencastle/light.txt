small light that turns on huge spot light with images in center of spot light.;2011-07-01 22:40:00;35 seconds;small light that turns on huge spot light with images in center of spot light. I was looking at the stars and saw a light that was very small going across the sky.  I thought it was a plane but there were no blinking lights.  All of a sudden the small light turned on a spot light that was 100 times larger than the small light.  It then moved the spot light to the east where I could barely see the light when it turned back towards me there was a dark hour glass shade in the middle of the spot light.  It then blinked and the hour glass was gone. It was then just the huge spot light.  It then turned off the spot light and there was the small light again.  It then just kept going across the sky like it was a satellite moving across the sky.  I thought it was a plane that turned on its landing light but this craft made no noise and there were no blinking lights on it at all.;39.6495;-86.8685999999999
