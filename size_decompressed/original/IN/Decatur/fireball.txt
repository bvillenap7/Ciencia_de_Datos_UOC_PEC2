My Uncle, his girlfriends kids, and I were out in the middle of the parking just in front of his appartment. We were shooting off fireworks, and all of the sudden one of the youger kids had said hey look over there.  So we looked and it was this yellowish-orange light kind of just sitting there. I thought at first maybe its just a firework, but then it started coming towards us.  I looked over to my uncle and said what is that. I remember saying hey maybe it's a helicopter or a plane, but it was flying way to high to be a helicopter and it had no blinking lights so it couldn't be a plane.  All of the sudden it turned to our right started moving for a few feet (relative to us).  Then it was like it turned around turned red and hit light speed, and in a split second it was gone just like that.
