white lighted ball shape ufo hovering slowly above tree tops, no sound;1986-08-15 23:55:00;30 seconds;white lighted ball shape ufo hovering slowly above tree tops, no sound I was in bed at the time and heard my brother yelling and was excited about something.  I got out of bed and thats when he said there were strange lights in the sky.  He said he looked out of the kitchen window and saw some triangle shaped object with 2 red lights ascending up towards it.  So we got the binoculars and went outside.  There was a farmers field behind our backyard with a bunch of trees on the other side of the field.  Thats were we saw this pure white ball of light(roughly the size of two cars stacked on each other) which was moving slowly just above the tree tops.  I tried looking at it through my binoculars but I couldnt keep my hands steady enough to make out any detail.  We lost sight of it went behind a bunch of trees.  That was all we saw that night.  I dont remember what time of year it was but my guess is late summer.  I do vividly remember looking at the clock and seeing 11:55 pm after we came back inside.  Also I remember there was a big full moon which lighted the sky a bit. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.8272;-84.9366
