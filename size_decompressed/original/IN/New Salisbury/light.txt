((anonymous report));2017-06-06 04:00:00;30 seconds;Standing in driveway, observed 2 very bright lights.  Thought at first they were planes (solid white light - steady) they were very close together and seemed to be coming towards us. Light intensity was increasing.   We all said of no are the they going to collide as the lights were getting very close together, then as they were close both began to fade out and then just disappeared.   We all thought the sight was very strange.   We continued to watch, but no plane or light reappeared after the even occurred.
