Square UFO spotted aprox. thirty miles from Fort Knox.;2008-10-16 00:53:00;30sec.;Square UFO spotted aprox. thirty miles from Fort Knox. It was starting to rain so I went out to roll the windows up on our car. When I turned around, facing east, I saw an object in the sky behind our home. I watched it, traveling south east, for about 30 seconds before the tree line blocked my view. The craft looked like a perfect square with four rectangular lights, one centered at each corner. It had framework outlining the bottom that resembled that which stage lights hang from. The object was charcoal in color and traveled point forward like an arrow. I couldn't make out any other details on the bottom nor could I see its top. I came inside sat down and started to draw a picture of what I'd seen while it was fresh in my mind. My first thought of its size was about 60'square after trying to sketch it to scale I realized it had to be bigger to look like what I saw. After the completed drawing I estimated it to be 100'square and the framework to be 8' across. This area is located less than 30 mile from Fort Knox Ky.;38.3426;-86.0924
