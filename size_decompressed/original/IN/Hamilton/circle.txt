AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A PLANE BUT IT GOT CLOSER AND WE SAW THE SHAPE GLOWING RED.  IT WASN'T MOVING ANYMORE AND IT HAD 2 BRIGHTER LIGHTS ON IT AND HOVERED OVER THE FIELD NEXT TO OUR HOUSE. THE HORSES WERE RUNNING EVERYWHERE AND OUR DOGS WERE LOOKING UP BARKING.  MY MOM TOLD US ALL TO RUN INTO THE HOUSE AND WE LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AT IT AND THEN IT TOOK OFF LIKE IT WAS THERE ONE SECOND AND GONE THE  NEXT, OFF INTO THE SKY.  IT WAS SO BIG AND BRIGHT. IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS AS BIG AS THE 10 ACRE FIELD NEXT TO US. IT WAS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF THE X-FILES! WE HAVE AN ARMY RECRUITMENT CENTER NEAR US AND THEY SAID THAT THEY HAD MANY CALLS ABOUT THE CRAFT HOWEVER THEY REFUSED TO GIVE US ANY INFORMATION, SAYING IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN AIRCRAFT.
