Reddish rectangular object;2013-09-27 16:00:00;5 minutes;September 27th at 4:00 p.m. North of Huntington Indiana. Large reddish rectangular object. Flying slowly from west to east. I was south of the object when I saw it. 	The object appeared to be about 150 feet long and about 1200 feet from the ground. 	At first I thought it was a banner but there was no visible airplane towing it.  The object then turned north. That was when it look most rectangular and 3 dimensional.  Almost like a large box kite. 	I attempted to follow it driving on country roads.  Woods and cornfields obscured my vision. The object then quickly disappeared over the north visible horizon.
