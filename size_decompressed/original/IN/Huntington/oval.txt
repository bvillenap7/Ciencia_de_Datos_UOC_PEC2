I noticed a small black ball shaped object floating slowly to the south.  The winds was from the southwest.   I grabbed my binoculars and found  a second object flying close to the first.  It to was a black ball shape object.  I watched them for about 3 minutes before loosing track of them. They appeared to be flying between 7 and 8 thousand feet.;40.8771;-85.5045
