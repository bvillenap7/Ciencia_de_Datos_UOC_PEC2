I was driving home it right 11:00pm   I was on a road facing west stopped waiting to turn to my left and was then facing south.  It was a clear night with a full moon.  When I turned I looked up at the moon and noticed a pulsating orange orb/fireball but it wasn't fire that I was seeing.  If you were facing south the moon was probably 70degrees in the sky from the horizon.  If you were looking at the moon and imagined it was a clock it would have been at about 4:30.   Now keep in mind this was a full moon, and it was bright enough to really stand out considering it was close to the moon.  It was stationary I live exactly 3 blocks from the road that I had turned off of.  I was driving fast because I wanted my mom to see it, it took me prob 30 seconds to get to my house.   I told my mom to come see it the object started moving in a southwest direction.   Now by the time we went outside in back yard it had accelerated extremely fast in a matter of about 25 seconds it was onl! y about 15 to 20 degrees above the southwest horizon!  It had to have accelerated to a very high speed and was out of eye sight within 15seconds of coming outside to the backyard!  I am not sure of the altitude but it seemed like at least 15 or 20 thousand feet because a plane came into view that was not to far away from the object, and then it was out of sight!  It made no sound, but since I didn't know its height it may have just been to high to hear it.  I couldn't make an educated guess on its size.  It looked like a ball of orange pulsating energy, I believe that it was not a part of a nuts and bolts craft I cant say for 100% certainty but that's what it seemed to be!
