2 bright, stationary lights in the southwestern sky, one appears to be hovering over another.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter.  PD));2008-11-28 17:00:00;15-20 minutes;2 bright, stationary lights in the southwestern sky, one appears to be hovering over another We were driving home from dinner down State Road 24.  We all noticed two bright objects in the southwestern sky.  They were stationary in the sky, one was higher in the air than the other.  At first we thought they were helicopters hovering, but we decided they weren't.  When we first noticed the objects they were very bright in the sky,  but as we drove southwest toward them, they dimmed for a while and then became brighter again.  We all thought it was a very odd sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter.  PD));40.8771;-85.5045
Pink lighted unknown object in sky over Huntington;2012-08-04 23:05:00;3 minutes;Pink lighted unknown object in sky over Huntington UFO August 4, 2012  At about 11:05 pm in Huntington Indiana I saw a pink light up in the sky.  It was moving slowly in a straight line.  But then it began to slow to nearly a stop.  It was completely silent.   I kept thinking I would hear a noise.  It would have to be a silent helicopter.  I know what a jetliner at 20 to 40 thousand feet looks like.  This pink light was non blinking.  I ran inside to get my 16 year old daughter.  About 30 seconds later when I got her to get her shoes on and come out, the light started moving away. It seemed to be only a few hundred feet up but hard to tell.    There were fireworks (delayed due to drought) that night which were supposed to be done but they kept on going after the finalé.  I had watched those right near my house and I had gone back inside the house after the finalé and had come back out to see why they were still firing them off.  Rain prior in the evening had apparently caused a problem with some of the fireworks. ;40.8771;-85.5045
