Watch the sky every night it was not planes or stars or metors called my neighbor to witness what I was seeing he was freaked out. Called another friend two blocks over she was freaked out seeing the same thing.  These objects was neither man made and could have been up to a 1 mile wide with similar light formations that resembled diamond shapes.   When there was breaks in cloulds you could see multiple diamonds shapes none resembling Constellation patterns.  Flying 10 times faster than a jet could.
