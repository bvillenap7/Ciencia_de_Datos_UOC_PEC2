Amber light hovered and visible for seven minutes.;1999-12-22 06:30:00;7 minutes;Amber light hovered and visible for seven minutes. I'm a public school teacher and have been interested in ufo's since age twelve.  I never had a sighting I was confident was a ufo until this morning.  I was going out to the truck to go to work this morning at 6:30am.  I noticed to the west, the sky was completely cloudy, but to the east everything was perfectly clear.  As I looked to the east, I noticed an amber light that was brighter and larger than any of the visible stars in the sky.  When I became aware of the stationary nature of the object, I began to talk out loud to it, asking it to come closer.  When I said that, the light grew in intensity, but was still a considerable distance from me.  At 6:35am, I got in truck and began to drive in the general direction of the light hoping to get more detail.  After driving a half mile to the east, I stopped the truck and rolled down the window.  Even though light was still some distance from me, I waved at it.  Almost immediately the amber light went off, revealing a constant, smaller red light.  In a matter of two seconds, the red light had moved beyond visible distance toward the east.;39.6598;-87.4225
