Two circular lights about the size of the moon;2008-05-24 00:15:00;2 mins;Two circular lights about the size of the moon I was about to go to bed when I looked outside my window the last time.  Southeast in the sky were two circular shapes.  They were both about the size of the moon.  The sky was completely cloudy, so there was no visible moon.  After about two minutes of sitting idle, it slowly disappeared.;37.9653;-87.3902
Five or more people saw a string of bright red lights hoving in the sky that disappeared;2008-05-31 21:40:00;5 minutes;Five or more people saw a string of bright red lights hoving in the sky that disappeared I am the daughter of the witness. My father, mother, and uncle were sitting outside. My mother came into the house to tell me they (mom, dad, and uncle) were going to drive down to a place where they saw a string of big red lights in the sky. They went there, and as they got there, two cars turning the corner suddenly stop as they approached the lights. But when they actually got there, the lights were gone. This took about five minutes. My father described them as big red Christmas lights hovering stationary in the sky. My mother described them like exploded fireworks that hadn’t disappeared. My uncle didn’t give a description. My father just now, at 21:54 of the same day, told me he called the sheriff and reported the event. The sheriff said that about a year ago, the exact same thing was reported in the exact same area.;37.9653;-87.3902
Stationary white light faded in and out;2011-10-06 02:12:00;1 second;Stationary white light faded in and out I just walked outside to the sidewalk to smoke a cigarette and when I first looked up to the sky the white light object faded in and then out once.  Object was stationary and appeared just a fraction below Pollux.;37.9653;-87.3902
Very weird stars forming a stationary triangle in the sky.;2013-08-26 01:00:00;2 hours;very weird stars forming a stationary triangle in the sky It looked as if it were stars yet they were low in the western sky and their was one in the front and 2 on each side like a triangle formation.  They were spinning not fast not slow. You could tell they were not stars.  They would move side to side but just a few feet both ways.  Were pretty staionary for the most part.;37.9653;-87.3902
Object just disappears, multiple colored lights no sound.;2018-10-25 04:22:00;10 minutes;Object just disappears, multiple colored lights no sound This is the second time I have seen it in the last two years.  My dogs always wake me up around 4 a.m. to go out.  Both sighting have been the same.  They are circular lights that have multiple colors.  The object appears to barely move and I am unsure of the distance. Object was north of Newburgh but I am not sure how far.  Just like the last time, I was observing it an it did not fly away it just disappeared.  They were airplanes in the sky, they had to have seen it.;37.9653;-87.3902
right green light that was coming toward her out of the west for 1 to 1-1/2 minutes, then anomalistic motion;2021-05-19 04:12:00;3 mins;The MADAR Op's wife was a lifelong skeptic and her object was an unmistakable UFO, She had taken one of the dogs out a few minutes before the event and was startled to see a bright green light that was coming toward her out of the west for 1 to 1-1/2 minutes, then anomalistic motion where the light suddenly jumped to the left (which no airplane or anything else can do), then jumped to the right, stopped, then just flat disappeared. None of the dogs in the neighborhood barked. There was no MADAR alert at this time, and the field readings didn't show anything anomalous. Newburgh's node 142 has a threshold shield of 27 and the field readings never exceeded 7.5 milligaus, which explains why 142 didn't trigger. The accelerometer readings were normal but the compass heading numbers from col. 3 varied more than 3 degrees. In fact almost 5 degrees. At 4:08 the data shows a 221.14 degree reading. Three or four minutes before her sighting, something was di! sturbing the geomagnetic field. It is my opinion that had the UFO gone vertical, MADAR would have shown a spike in the field 2-3 times normal but still probably wouldn't have triggered the device. Also, if 142 HAD gone into alert, the data rate would have jumped to once per second, but the status rate is one line per minute under trigger.  Two of the ReoLink skycams had been offline for months and the two that were running were aimed east and south.The west and north cams were not online. A few days later the cameras were pulled and the west and north were found to have been destroyed by moisture leaks at the lens. (MADAR Operations Center).;37.9653;-87.3902
