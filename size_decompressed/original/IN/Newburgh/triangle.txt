This happened in the country about 2 mi. north of Alcoa. We were outside talking and noticed to the east of where we were this lighted object just hovering in one spot. The lights appeared to be flashing of some sort. All of a sudden as fast as you can move your hand above your head and as far down as possible this thing moved this fast and flew right back up just as fast. Up,down,up,down several times. When the thing flew up you could hear the cows in the distant 1 mile away mooing. After watching for about 1 hr. it started heading west toward us. I could no longer see any lights though as it moved directly over our heads we could see it was huge about the size of a football field only triangular in shape it was not that high in the air maybe 800 ft. there was no noise coming from this thing at all total silence I could even hear the crickets as it moved over top of us.

Very large triangle shaped craft over Southern Indiana.;2014-10-08 08:20:00;>1 minute;Very large triangle shaped craft over Southern Indiana. My wife and I watch for shooting stars several times a week. Tonight we saw an orange light coming quickly from east to west. As it got closer it shifted into three lights. It appeared to be 200-300 feet long and maybe 100 feet wide.  It made some sound but was not loud like a jet. It looked similar to jets flying in formation but when it was directly overhead we could see it was solid and blocked out stars as it passed in front of them.  It was maybe half the altitude that the planes fly above our home.  When it was roughly 1/2 mile past us it made a 90 degree turn and went northeast quickly.  My 14 year old son also saw it. His take was it looked like a star destroyer from Star Wars.  The two light in the rear were rectangular and were taller than they were wide.  The light on the front was thin and horizontal.  This all happened with a very bright full moon so we could easily see the shape.  Needless to say we are all freaked a little.  We got on google to see if anyone else saw anything and found this site.;37.9653;-87.3902

Both aircraft were indentical in size, shape and speed, the estimated size was roughly 10 times that of a star or a 1/3 of the moon, but appeared to be at a very substainal height.  Both aircraft traveled from the southwest to the east, and made it from horizon to horizon in no more than 15 seconds. Each aircraft entered the sky and exited the sky in the same location within 10 minutes of each other. After each sighting, we witnessed heavy air traffic in the vicinity of the exiting location by presumably both human and indentifiable aircraft.   The presence was not threatening, at anything it was welcoming and I  even shouted for the aircraft to take me with it. After witnessing the second aircraft we sat on a nearby swing set to hopefully have 1 more sighting.  Approximately 15 minutes after the 2nd sighting had concluded we witnessed what appeared to be an aircraft that was stationary and astetically identical to a star begin moving from the northwest to the southeast and disappear into the night sky.  The third aircraft was visible for 1 minute before fading out.;37.9653;-87.3902

It didn’t fly off that I could tell, it was as if I had lost track of it. It just vanished.  I know my son saw it too because he mentioned it looked like a V.  It did appear hazy between the lights like it was cloaked.  I don’t believe  there was any sound involved at all. It was a clear night sky,  I could see the stars well.;37.9653;-87.3902
