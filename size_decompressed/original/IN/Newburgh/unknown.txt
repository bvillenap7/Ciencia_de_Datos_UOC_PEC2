Large orange light Newburgh, IN 10/14/12;2012-10-14 21:15:00;5 minutes;Large orange light Newburgh, IN 10/14/12 On the evening of 10/14/12, at approximately 9:15 pm CST.  I walked out my front door, facing west.   A bright orange light was seen coming towards me, above the tree line.  As it approached I could make out two large orange lights on each side with a bright red light in the center.  It was moving at an even speed.  The lights were not blinking, and were extremely bright and colorful. I entered the house and got my wife, who witnessed it briefly from this angle as well.  It then went out of our range of vision due to our house.  We went inside and out the back door, bringing our daughter.  It was located again continuing toward the east until it was out of sight.;37.9653;-87.3902
