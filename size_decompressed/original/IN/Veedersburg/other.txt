Orange sphere drops from bright orange light and 3 angled spheres appear after;2019-10-07 20:00:00;2-5 minutes;Orange sphere drops from bright orange light and 3 angled spheres appear after The night of October 6th, I noticed a large orange light in the sky to the northwest. Approximately 5 minutes later a smaller orange light (both of which in shape of sphere) dropped from the bigger one and the bigger one then dimmed a bit as the smaller light fell below the horizon line.  The light then started traveling to the east and looked like it was moving farther north as well.  Then seconds later it moved south closer to me and suddenly vanished. The following night (7th) I noticed the same orange light at roughly same time.  This time at a perfect slanted angle there were 2 other lights.  Only seconds after noticing the highest light it went out. Then the middle one.  Then the end one.  I watched the area for several minutes after, and they havenâ€™t reappeared.;40.1194;-87.2563
