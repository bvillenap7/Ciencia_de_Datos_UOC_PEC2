As it moved closer, its size appeared even greater than at first sight.  It appeared to shift direction and began to slowly move east.  I could not believe the size of this light.  It was like nothing I had ever seen in the sky before.  After watching for maybe 20 seconds, the light vanished completely and I noticed an airplane flying in from the east.  Coincidence?  I don't know. Strange? Definitely.;40.1194;-87.2563
