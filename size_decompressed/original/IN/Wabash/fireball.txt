Giant red/orange glowing ball in night sky along horizon that had a duration of 5 minutes.;2014-02-15 19:23:00;5 minutes;Giant red/orange glowing ball in night sky along horizon that had a duration of 5 minutes We were driving to a basketball game around 7:20 pm and all of a sudden noticed a reddish/orange glowing ball that looked like a half set sun in the east direction.   At first we thought it was the moon, but then noticed that the white moon was already up in the sky.  We also thought of the possibility that it could be the sunset, but then came to the realization that the sun sets in the west.   This ball was at least ten times larger than the size of the moon.  We then drove on for another five minutes and planned to take a picture when we stopped driving.   We arrived at the game and got out to take the picture and it was gone.  It disappeared as fast as it had appeared and had a duration of five minutes.  Then 2 hours later, after the game, we were driving home in the same direction and checked the sky one last time.  We did not notice a ball but did see a slight orange tint in the sky in the exact same place.   We then came home to do research and got to the conclusi! on that it must have been a UFO.
