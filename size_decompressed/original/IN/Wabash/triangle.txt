When it got closer I realized almost immediately that it was some sort of air craft, triangular in shape, with eight or nine lights on the bottom - though none were lit.  I had an exceptional look at the craft and have no doubt in my mind what it was.  The craft was traveling around 30 - 40 mph and was completely silent.  Upon noticing what I was looking at I became frightened and ran inside to alert my girlfriend.   We returned outside a few minutes later to notice two red non flashing lights traveling through the sky at high speeds and moving sporadically with seemingly no effort.  There were also several other aircraft in the sky, but were man made and a helicopter, all of them seemingly headed in the direction of the UFO. It then disappeared and that was the last that I saw of the craft.;40.7908;-85.8327
