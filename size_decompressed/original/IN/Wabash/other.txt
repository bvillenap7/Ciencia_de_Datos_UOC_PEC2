Five or more bright orange sphere shapes in the night sky.;2004-04-09 21:00:00;30-45sec.;Five or more bright orange sphere shapes in the night sky. I was traveling home heading west.  It was dark and cloudy with cloud coverage.  I don't know what it was, but it just appeared.  In the west sky high above the tree line.  Whatever I saw had five or more round burnt orange center cirle shapes in a horizontal line.  The circle shapes reminded me of big stadium lights that were orange that would fad into a haze on the outer edges.  Like I said there were five or more.  It could of been a big circular shape that all the lights were connected to, because it was cloudy.  It was so bright that it cast a shadow on the clouds.  I never seen any metal only the round orange globes.  I seen the thing  I started fumbeling for my cell phone, never taking my eyes off of it.  I was stopped right in front of my house.  Then it was gone, before I even had my phone in hand.;40.7908;-85.8327
