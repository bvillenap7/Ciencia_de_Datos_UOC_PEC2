We first thought it was a commercial jet, but we heard no engine sound at all.  I estimate the altitude to have been fifteen to twenty thousand feet.  About the time the object was directly overhead, we heard what sounded like a military aircraft in hot pursuit.  Its rate of closure was fast enough that it was about to overtake the silent object.  We stood transfixed as the silent object made a precise 90 degree turn to the southwest and accelerated OUT OF SIGHT in no more than two seconds, leaving the military aircraft helplessly behind.  We watched for a short time after that, but nothing else happened.  That is all we saw.  I verbally verified it with my elderly friend to be sure we both saw the same event. She confirmed that she had.  About the same period of time, I can't remember if it was before or after, along this same stretch of road, a farmer lost some of his pigs to mutilation.  Their nostrils and rectums were surgically removed.  No tracks led up to or away from the carcasses. Local law enforcement was unable to make any determination as to who or what it was.  As far as I know, the case was never closed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD));40.9928;-87.1067
