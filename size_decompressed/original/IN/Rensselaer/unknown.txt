Three lights, one of them blinking. Moves north, then southeast, east, west, and every which way.;2012-08-21 21:00:00;30:00;*** I am a television producer. This was emailed to our local TV weather center email address in Chicago. I'm simply passing on the text of the email while keeping the party involved anonymous. ***  &quotThere's something really freaky in the sky just west of a mile north of Rensselaer.  It's at least twice as high as the jets flying over. Appears to have maybe three lights, one of them blinking. Moves north, then southeast, east, west, and every which way. Has been there for at least a half hour. We are kind of freaking out. Can you help us find out what it is please? Thank you much!&quot;40.9928;-87.1067
