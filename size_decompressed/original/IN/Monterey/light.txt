Stationary brightening light that faded gradually.;2018-09-13 19:28:00;10 seconds;Stationary brightening light that faded gradually. I was observing the moon a nd jupiter when an object caught my attention.  The object was a light that kept getting brighter as I focused on it.  I thought perhaps it was a pulsing sattelite, but it did not move.  The stationary light gradually faded over ten seconds time.  It was located 12:00 east-west, and 1:30 south and reached the brightness of venus briefly.  I am a 63 year old retired auto mechanic with no bad habits.;41.1383;-86.5179
