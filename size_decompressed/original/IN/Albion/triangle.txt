Saw lights next to a tower, at first i thought they might have been part of the tower and maybe I never noticed them before.  When i got closer I realized that it was some type of air craft.  At first it looked cigar shaped, not huge, maybe 30 ft wide.  4 LIGHTS seen from the front, they were red and white.  Object was right next to the tower, maybe 50 - 100 ft from the tower...the same height as the top of the tower.  Could see very well as I passed right by it that it was more of a triangle shape, maybe triangle more with rounded edges.  Saw 1 or 2 lights on the back.  Immediately called my husband.  As I continued down the road i could see in my mirrors, that the objected slowly headed south across road, then slowly headed back towards the tower.  I continued down the road about 2 miles to my house, seen it most of the way home, grabbed my husband went back out and couldn't see it anymore.  The only light on ! the tower is one white light.  Was Definantly not part of the tower. Did not hear any noise from the object.  But looked dark, like black.  Just 4 lights on the front when it looked cigar shaped, but after i passed and could see the bottom definantly looked more triangular.  No lights on the bottom, all on the sides of the craft.;41.3458;-85.4155
