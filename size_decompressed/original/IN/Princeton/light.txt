Return of short-lived bright orange lights in night sky NNW of Ft Branch/Princeton, IN area that dissipate after initial illuminations.;2004-04-15 20:57:00;15-20 seconds;Return of short-lived bright orange lights in night sky NNW of Ft Branch/Princeton, IN area that dissipate after initial illuminations. While standing in the parking lot of Gibson General Hospital in Princeton, IN, talking with a friend I noticed the same orange light appear in the NNW sky as I had the prior night. I asked my friend to look in the direction that I was pointing to just as the light dissappeared. About 5 seconds later a second orange light appeared then dissappeared. I asked my friend if he had seen the same light. He stated that he had. There was another couple standing in the lot as well and I believe that they had heard me say something about the light, but I do not know if they saw it or not. We continued to watch the sky for any further events. The conditions of the night sky was dark and mostly clear with a very slight haze as the light emminated tonight was not as bright as the night before from the objects. I did notice other commercial aircraft in the sky, but not near enough the obect or travelling in the same direction that would suggest that it may be from those. The lights were high enough in the sky to obviously not be any city lights just as they were the night before. To guess, the craft would have had to been at an altitude of 10-15,000 ft. given their distance, brightness of the night and location in the sky. This is similar to the night prior at roughly the same time and location in the sky.
