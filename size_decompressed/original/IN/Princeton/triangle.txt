Was outside at 3:20 and at 3:29 noticed funny light moving through the tree outside the back door.  Once it got into a clear view, I noticed it was very unusual, certainly not a normal aircraft nor a drone.  I got the binoculars for a closer look, and noticed it to be triangular in shape with 3 blue/white lights at each point with one larger pulsating red light at the center.  It looked to be up around 15-20,000 ft at approx 45 degrees.  I watched in move very slowly, occasionally picking up speed, then stop to hover, move some more, stop then turned 180 degrees where it stood and moved north to south.  It stopped for 5 seconds, became brighter, and vanished with a speed impossible to follow.  The event lasted 7 minutes, the sky was pretty clear, no moon, no other planes at that time.  I waited for 30 minutes, but no return.  Nothing I know of can take off at that kind of speed from a stand still.  Hopefully, someone may have seen it, too.;38.3534;-87.5725999999999
