Weird slow moving aircraft with bright lights;2014-02-13 10:30:00;5 minutes;Weird slow moving aircraft with bright lights I was riding along to work with my car pool buddy when we seen what we thought was a helicopter.  I  watched and as it flew over I noticed that it was gun metal grey.  And cylinder. I assumed it was a blimp.  But it's been in the negatives here so I didn't know why an unmarked blimp would be flying so late.   This was Tuesday right inside evansville.  I spent all day Wednesday trying to look up online to see if any blimps or anything have come up.  I found nothing. Wednesday right at where you go to Princeton from 41.  Me and the same car pool buddy spotted just the lights of an extremely slow moving aircraft.  It had one big light in front and several lights on the side. It just turned around like a balloon would turn easy.  Then rounded Princeton and landed somewhere over there. It was huge and slow moving. I'm not sure what it is. I've tried to find on the news if anyone else has seen it or if it's supposed to be there.  I can't find anything.  I've been driving back and forth for 2 years and haven't seen anything like this.;38.3534;-87.5725999999999
