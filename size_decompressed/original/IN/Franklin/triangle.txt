((HOAX??)) I have seen posts with stories similar to mine. Giant triangular aircraft emitting no noise.;1998-10-01 22:00:00;10 minutes;I have seen posts with stories similar to mine.  Giant triangular aircraft emitting no noise.  Its strange because if an air craft so large and peculiar hovered over a crowded area, you would hear about it from everyone.  Right?  Then why do I vividly remember this happening when I was 6 years old 20 years ago. Vividly.  A dream?  Sometimes you remember your dreams in vivid detail and sometimes you can't remember what it was even about.  I would wager that whoever is reading this right now cant remember one dream from 10 years old or younger.  What makes us remember our dreams?  Is it possible that some people are not remembering what happend just like a forgotten dream?  One of two things happened to me, I dreamt of the giant triangular air craft hovering over hundreds of cars or it happened and no one said a word.  This being 20 years ago I tend to convince myself that it was a dream.  But I find it hard to believe that after all those years I can recall every detail ! of that dream and yet I can't remember where my brain wondered last night while sleeping.  If you want to have a serious debate on UFO's or explore evidence you have to take this into consideration.  Why haven't any of these giant UFO's made the 5 o clock news?  Are some of us forgetting our dreams? ((NUFORC Note:  Semi-anonymous source.  We are uncertain as to whether this is a serious report, although we agree that it is odd that the mainstream press does no cover the UFO phenomenon.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));39.4815;-86.0614999999999
Triangle craft hovering 5 minutes, no sound, lights, very dark black;2006-05-03 22:35:00;5 minutes;Triangle craft hovering 5 minutes, no sound, lights, very dark black Coming home from work on rural roads, saw Triangle shape with 3 lights, 1 on each point, and one in middle, hovering over Union Elementary School location in Union Township.  Stopped car and got out to observe.  Was approx. 1500 feet in air, very clearly triangle shaped and absolutely no sound noted.  The shape itself appeared to be deep black, darker than the night sky, almost seemed to absorb any light, and the lights did not appear to illuminate anything under it.  This is in restricted military airspace for Camp Atterbury, which is located approx. 20 miles south.  I observed carefully until the craft slowly moved off to the northwest.  My mother had also had a sighting over our house approx. 3 miles southeast of this location on 11/8/04 of the same type of object.  She notes that during her observation, the craft also had no sound and was very low to the ground.  She had reported her observation to Art Bell by e-mail and still retains a copy of that e-mail.;39.4815;-86.0614999999999
I saw along both sides of the interstate 3 triangle shaped objects with 2 bright lights in the middle on the bottom of them.;2010-10-04 20:30:00;5 mins or longer;I was driving south on I-65 between Franklin, IN and Edinburgh, IN.  I saw along both sides of the interstate 3 triangle shaped objects with 2 bright lights in the middle on the bottom of them.  I opened the windows and the sunroof and could hear no engines or other sound.  I drove directly beneath one of the objects and could see the outline of the triangle against the sky.  In the rear view mirror I could see that one of the objects changed to red and started sending out red lights.  I was scared and didn’t stay to watch, I headed home and ran in the house.;39.4815;-86.0614999999999
Triangle hovered low for several minutes and went nne slowly and silently.;2015-02-17 20:05:00;4-5 minutes;triangle hovered low for several minutes and went nne slowly and silently.    --Lat, long,-- (39.536510, -86.077044) --GPS coordinates-- 39° 32' 11.4360'' N86° 4' 37.3584'' W  I was working delivering pizzas on February 17th, 2015 and it was about 8:05pm. We had several inches of fresh snow and it was still overcast, no stars or moon. I was pulling up to a red light (A) on US-31 at the Franklin/Whiteland town line, central Indiana, USA.  I was the only car at the intersection.  I was pulling up to the light, facing east and i noticed two lights right behind the tree tops off to my 1 o'clock, they didn't seem to be moving but i didn't think twice about it because sometimes planes seem to be standing still from the right angle.   I came to stop, checked it was clear and saw the two lights, white, steady on, still hadn't moved.  And i noticed they were pretty far apart, roughly a city block and tilted down to the (my) right maybe 20°.  I'm guessing ¼mi to ½mi. away(B).   I turned right on the red light, eyes now glued to the lights looking for distinction.  As i moved south down US-31 a third light came in to view to the right of the first two.  Nearly the same! distance apart it appeared, it was also white but flashed red at a little faster than once per second.  I drove nearly a quarter mile, under the speed limit, rolling down the window, turning off the music and heat, and staring.   I pulled over (C) realizing how unsafe i was being, silently watching, as it remained static, pitched, for around two full minutes.   At this point i had still not heard any noises that wasn't one of the ten cars that passed me the entire time or my jaw hitting the road outside.  After the approximate two minutes of watching three lights and hearing no sounds the aircraft leveled off allowing me to see the two white lights move together and reveal there was no further leading parts of the aircraft ahead of those points.  Straight across that edge.  After leveling it continued to pitch, this time to the NNW at maybe 10° and began moving, blunt edge first, in that direction.   I saw it start moving and threw my car into gear and zipped to the next pass thru in! the median watching it the best i could.  Still almost no traf! fic i wa s able to get going north bound before it got far.  It didn't leave quickly, just suddenly.  I'm having trouble estimating it's speed, it seemed to triple mine at the least, but not shockingly fast, no bright flash or anything.  I got turned around and up to 60mph+ and was looking at the tailing end of it. The craft never ascended or descended.  Remained just a few hundred feet off of the ground. I never saw any other lights, or heard any sounds.  Even though i was able to watch it from two different positions I never got a glimpse of its silhouette, just the shape of the three lights and the angle change when it pitched forward at the front before it left.  I followed the best I could, maybe 30 seconds watching the two steady white lights at the sides, and the white light flashing red centered right in between them, until it again faded behind the tree tops a few miles ahead of me in straight line(D).  I saw no other planes helicopters or crafts any time before or after.;39.4815;-86.0614999999999
