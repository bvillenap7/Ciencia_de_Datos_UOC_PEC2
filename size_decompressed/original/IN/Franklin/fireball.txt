Fiery orbs moving into formations while dropping smaller orbs.;2013-08-12 22:00:00;15 minutes;Fiery orbs moving into formations while dropping smaller orbs. Sitting outside with a neighbor I noticed large bright orange/yellow lights in the sky off in the horizon.  We watched as the two objects seemed to come together into one, as yet more objects began to appear, starting as a small orange light and growing to the size of the others, none of which were larger than the others.   They made formations, when there were three they briefly made a triangle formation before some of the objects would either join together or slowly vanish over about a five second timespan.   When there were four they briefly made a square, and when there were five they seemed to form a straight line.   During our sighting these objects randomly dropped smaller objects of the same shape and color, these slowly dropped below the tree line towards the ground.   After watching for a few minutes I realized I could take video/pictures, by this time the objects had come together, almost looking like a single object, and dropped a final smaller light,   I was able to get video of this, and a dozen pictures or so, before the lights faded and were gone.;39.4815;-86.0614999999999
Fireball traversing laterally across the sky between Franklin and Bargersville.;2013-08-14 00:25:00;~10 seconds;Fireball traversing laterally across the sky between Franklin and Bargersville. I was outside smoking a cigarette, looked up, and happened to notice what at first glance appeared to be a meteor but after a few seconds I realized that it was moving laterally across the sky and not falling in the way that normal meteors do.   By this time I also noticed that it was leaving a trail of light with a corona just behind the object and it disappeared from my sight after a few more seconds as it traveled north by northeast.;39.4815;-86.0614999999999
