Amber lights appearing from the south and moving north.;2013-06-01 22:00:00;~30 minutes;Amber lights appearing from the south and moving north. Saw 3 amber colored lights that appeared to be oval in shape.  There were 2 initially seen and then shortly behind those a third one appeared and came from the south and were going north.  They were silent and made sharp direction changes. We were unsure though if we more than 3 or if the 3 we first saw were going in a circle as there were trees in our line of sight.;39.4815;-86.0614999999999
