Glowing Fire Colored Orb in the Sky;2012-09-26 20:40:00;4-5 minutes;Glowing  Fire Colored Orb in the Sky At 8:45PM, In Muncie, Indiana, at approximately 180ft Northwest of the intersection of Reserve and Centennial Avenue, I saw a single fire colored circular orb of light in the sky travel Northeast for a distance of about 100ft then it traveled backward stopping for a moment close to its original Northwest position.It made a spiral jerking motion as though it were wavering before it continued forward fluidly again in the opposite direction for a distance of about 275 Ft and simply vanished like it was never there.It did not travel into the distance becoming dimmer, it literally vanished as if the light had been extinguished without any trace. I was accompanied in this sighting by a random neighbor who happened to be driving and actually pulled over in his vehicle to park and observe this phenomenon.;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325
At one point I centered on the object. It was light grayish blue with a dark circular center.;2012-12-04 20:00:00;2 hours;My husband called to tell me that he saw something in the sky that was moving very fast, up, down, left and right.  I went outside and saw it.  I have a high powered telescope and I brought it outside.  My husband arrived home a few minutes later.  I focused on the object the best I could since it was moving.   At one point I centered on the object.  It was light grayish blue with a dark circular center.  It had several dark thick and thin lines.  Some were very thick and dark and other were faint and almost looked cellular and like it had veins.  The object hovered for some time.  Meanwhile we also saw several military jets flying in the area, but lower.  I googled doughnut shaped UFOs and saw several images that were similar to what we saw.  The object appeared to drop or shoot something out of it a couple of times.  The UFO also had light, but I do not think its the same type of light that our aircraft has, it was almost like the whole thing glowed blue.  I do stargaze quite a bit and I would say that the object was quite large and very bright from the ground, yet it appeared to glow once we saw it through the telescope.

Opalescent orb witnessed in east-central Indiana sky.;2017-06-18 19:00:00;5 seconds;Opalescent orb witnessed in east-central Indiana sky. I was taking a break at my night supervisor job at Ball State Universityâ€™s Bracken Library and while looking out a south facing window, I witnessed an opalescent orb suddenly appear about mid-sky and immediately shoot off towards the East.  The entire sighting lasted about five seconds.  Cloud coverage was spotty.  The orb did not reappear after passing behind a cloud.  I watched the sky for several more minutes and did not see the orb again.;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325
