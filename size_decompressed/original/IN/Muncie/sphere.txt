Bright orange light in the northwest sky near the Muncie airport.;2009-09-01 22:00:00;5 min;Bright orange light in the northwest sky near the Muncie airport. It was around 10:30 on the night of September first and I was out on my third story balcony smoking a cigarette when I looked up a saw a fairly large orange light in the northwest sky near the Muncie airport.  At first I thought it was a plane coming in for a landing at the airport and I thought to myself, “Wow, look at that plane.” But when the object didn’t move or have any other lights on it I started to wonder if it what I was looking at. After a few minutes of watching the light started to move slowly away from the horizon and even looked just a little bigger. I continued to watch the light for several more minutes while I finished my cigarette and after I was done smoking I went inside. A few minutes later, no more than 5 minutes, I remembered that I had left my Mountain Dew out on the balcony so I went out to get it. When I was outside I looked back up in the sky to see if I could find the light again and it had disappeared. I did not think anything of it until the next day and I began to wonder if I had seen a UFO. I am a Ball State student from South Bend and I have seen thousands of planes come in for landings at the South Bend airport because my house is only a few miles away but this was bigger and did not look like any plane I have ever seen.;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325
