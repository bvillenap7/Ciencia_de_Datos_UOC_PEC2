Strobing Star like objects in the sky being observed by aircraft;2010-11-08 23:30:00;45 MINUTES;Strobing Star like objects in the sky being observed by aircraft Approximately five star like objects hovering and moving at slow speed were observed over downtown Muncie Indiana.These objects were east of Muncie at about 15,000 feet. The objects would constantly twinkle like a star and then suddenly emit green strobes for several seconds before switching off. This cycle would then repeat with red strobing lights. After about 45 minutes the objects completely disappeared one by one. The light that these objects emitted were  different from aircraft strobes as they were seemingly had random time intervals and were very bright when compared to other aircraft in the area. These objects were being observed or chased by what appeared to be delta wing aircraft which turned their landing lights on when approaching the objects. They diverted and  left they area when the objects began to diminish;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325
saw glowing orange ball of light and ghostly face;2011-07-04 22:00:00;3 min;saw glowing orange ball of light and ghostly face on july 4th 2011 my family and i were watching fireworks in muncie in. and my fiance said something about a ufo and i turned the camera and saw a glowing orange ball of light.   I couldn't see it on my view finder but i could see the light very clearly.  it was to the right of the fireworks.   i was afraid i wasn't recording it so i gave the camera to my fiance.  it flew close to the fireworks and stopped. the object sit there for a minute and flew off to the left almost through the fireworks and behind some trees. we thought it was gone so we kept recording the fireworks.   we wasn't sure we recorded the object until we viewed the sd card and we saw the craft and we also saw a ghostly, alien, almost demonic face come into view.  it was only a face but it would open and close it's mouth and when it was facing us you could see glowing white eyes.  we could not see the face while recording we were focused on the orange craft.  but while watching the video we saw that face and didn't know what to think.;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325

The craft seemed to stay out in front of us for a couple of minutes then flew off to the north.  About 2 day's later i was telling a friend about what we saw and he has a nice computer so i said lets check the s d card out of the camera what i saw has had me spooked since as it turns out we did catch the craft and right below it you can see a ghostly image of a face and  you can see it's glowing eye's just for a second and it's mouth open and shut it's very disturbing;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325
A light that could be mistaken for a satellite except for ita erratic movements.;2014-07-03 23:40:00;15 minutes;A light that could be mistaken for a satellite except for ita erratic movements. While taking my dog out I was viewing the stars. I began to see movement and assumed it was a satellite, I have viewed them before. What caught my attention it suddenly went backwards very quickly.   As I continued to watch the object planes were flying by but again this object was very high up.  The object began to move erratically, first straight up then it made a 90 degree turn.  It would move at angles and then radically move in a saw blade motion.  I tried to capture it on my cell phone but really did not have much success.  I am not saying its extraterrestrial, my first thought was military.  I was amazed at its ability to move so quickly and in so many different directions.  If we have this type of technology it has never been reported to my knowledge. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Bright white light from craft vanishes instantly over I-69 north around Muncie/Warren area in Indiana.;2014-10-14 22:45:00;1 minute;Bright white light from craft vanishes instantly over I-69 north around Muncie/Warren area in Indiana. We were driving north on i-69 and saw what we thought was a plane.  It was shortly after exit 278.  We noticed it only because the light looked neat across the clouds.  We looked at it not for very long and then it just vanished.  We saw no more light.  It was a bright white light and we saw no other red green lights like you do on an airplane. It was lower than a normal plane would be in that area.  Even if it was a plane and turned directions we would have still seen a light.  We dont know what it was.;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325
Flashing lights everywhere in sky.;2015-11-04 21:00:00;1 hour;Flashing lights everywhere in sky. For the last three times that I took psycehdelics, lights appeared in the sky and were flashing at me.  These lights appear to be in morse code.  They change direction very fast and change colors from purple to yellow.  I finally took a video last night of my encounter.  Any person that i've shown is amazed at what I have to show to them.  I have been trying to communicate with them through though projection. I keep asking them for their help since humanity is on the path to extinction.  I've concluded that they can not be planes because all planes follow direct paths and can not move at all directions.  It can not be a glare because nothing was flashing different colors around me.   Sometimes I see multiple flashes going off at once in the sky and they seem to dance around each other.  I've seen some of their spacecraft but it's hard to get them on video since the lights are so faint.  They travel at speeds that I've never seen before. No human technology is close to what I can see in the night sky.  I try to put a sane mind on it everytime it happens but I know and feel what I saw.   Aliens are amoung us and they are here to save this planet.;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325
Unusual solid bright white light slowly traveling across the night sky.;2018-05-23 21:40:00;2 minutes;Unusual solid bright white light slowly traveling across the night sky. I work a late shift at Ball State University’s Bracken Library (6PM – 3AM) and while I was talking a walk outside during my lunch hour at approximately 9:40PM I was suddenly overcome by an unexplained chill.  Although it was 70 degrees Fahrenheit, I began shivering and my teeth were chattering as if I was walking outside in freezing winter temperatures. At that moment I looked up and saw a brighter than a star solid white light very slowly moving steadily from the southwest towards the northeast.  Thankfully there were three airplanes in the sky as well.  The airplanes were obvious due to their familiar flashing lights and shape definable by their security lights on the tips of the wings and tail.  The object I saw was no airplane.  There were no flashing or pulsing lights and no sound.  It just a bright solid white light a little bigger and brighter than the surrounding stationary stars and it steadily moved very slowly across the entire arc of the sky in a straight line from southwest to northeast in about two minutes.  After it was out of sight my experience of the chills ceased and it felt like 70 degrees Fahrenheit should.   Although I mysteriously developed the chills during the sighting, I can report zero feelings of apprehension or fear.  In fact it was as if I had no feelings about the sighting at all (and it is my fourth UFO sighting in my 43 years of life).;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325
