ufo sighted just north of muncie,indiana;1993-08-20 22:00:00;5 minutes;ufo sighted just north of muncie,indiana On a warm, clear, summer evening, I was driving home. I lived in a house about 2 miles outside of the town of Muncie,Indiana. 80,000 people. I was passing the municiple airport, and saw an object hovering, only 20 feet above a 1 story house, which sat right next to a large subdivision of about 400 homes. Object was less than 1 mile from airport. I drove towards it, in my truck. When I got within 500 feet, I turned my lights off and drove, staring at this object. I came within 300 feet when I realized it made absolutely no sound. It rose about 30 feet, then took off towards the northwest sky and dissapeared in seconds. All without a sound. Object had three lights on the bottom. Red,green,blue. Thought it was a chopper at first. But why hover silenlty, 20 feet over a house, and then take off from a dead stop, to out of sight in 3 seconds? Sonic booms are common in this area, but this was silent.;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325

Around 10:30pm I noticed something in the sky, it was a large black triangle with 2 bright white lights on the back points.  This large craft floated overhead in kind of a horseshoe like move then it went off slowly, to the right in a straight line. It didn't make any sound at all.  This lasted for a few minutes, during this time my friends and I were trying to figure out if it was military, a UFO, or something else.  We were very excited either way.  We kept watching this craft go to the right of us, then it seemed to pause, the lights seemed to get brighter... then all of the sudden the white lights turned to orange and the entire craft disappeared.  At this point the 3 of us determined this thing was definitely a UFO.  I am not saying that this craft must be extraterrestrial, but if it is man made it is being kept a secret from the public.  In any case I got really creeped out by seeing it had my friends take me home shortly afterwards.  Also, the pond that we were at, was very close to a small airport in Muncie IN;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325

It was Orange in color and was very bright, we were in awe of its size and brightness.  As we were looking and trying to determine what it was it started to move very slowly and take a triangle shape with twinkling lights on each point of the triangle, the lights were almost pulsating.  The craft kept moving in a very slow, linear path that looked like it was coming directly towards us.  It passed just to our right and was only 1,500-2,000 feet in the air, as it came closer we quickly determined it wasn't any airplane or helicopter because it made no sound.  When the craft passed us we noticed 3 more with identicle shapes appear, they were also moving slowly and had the same linear path just spaced further apart. As we watched the other crafts as they moved closer we noticed one craft that was almost directly infront of us drop a small, light-like object to the ground.  My friend and I were already kinda freaked out about seeing these objects and became almost scared when we saw one drop something to the ground.  These crafts continued their straight, slow paths and when they passed they just sorta disappeared.  We drive for another 5-10 minutes before arriving at our destination, when we arrived we continued to look in the eastern sky where these crafts were coming from and ended up seeing three more that went right over our heads.  We got very good looks at the ones that went right over our heads, they were definitely large black triangles with lights on each point and a few lights in the middle and along the edges.  They were moving very slow and had no sound until they were just past us, then we heard a very light propulsion-like engine sound. All of these objects basically just appeared and were all uniform in size, shape, and color, but their lights differed in slight color and patterns of the pulsations.  My friend and I are just a couple regular, football loving, family guys and neither one of us have ever seen anything that compares to what we saw this night.  After seeing these objects we tried to come up with logical explanations as to what these things were and we came up with nothing.  Neither of us are aviation experts, but due to the size, altitude, sound, and light configurations we were both very confident these objects were not planes or helicopters or weather ballons.;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325
Sighting of multiple triangular shaped objects with yellow & orange/red lights moving across the sky near Muncie, IN.;2013-03-31 03:00:00;5-10 minutes;Sighting of multiple triangular shaped objects with yellow & orange/red lights moving across the sky near Muncie, IN.  500 Lights On Before this sighting, I was a huge skeptic about this stuff. I'm still not sure what these were, but I do know what I saw doesn't match up with anything I have ever heard of, read about or seen before. I am not an aeronautical expert or even hobbiest, but I can't get the piture of these things out of my head and have been doing research all day. I came across this website where I have read several peoples' desciriptions of similar sightings and thought I would share my own. The time was between 2:30 and 3:30 AM. I was catching a ride home from a friend and had some trouble getting into my house that night. I had recently moved away and was back to visit and I forgot to grab a key from my dad. Anyways, my friend offers to let me crash at his place, so we make the 5 or 10 minute drive it takes to get to his place. We pull up and I grab a couple things from his back seat before we turn and start to head towards his side door. At this point, we are facing East with a full(ish) moon off to our right. I honestly don't remember who saw them first but there in the sky, traveling in a general north-east direction, are 3 objects moving in perfect synchrination. There appearance was triangular, and they all looked the same. They appeared to have yellow lights on each corner of their respective triangles with an red-orange light in the center. As they traveled we noticed that the formation they were moving in was a giant perfect triangle. The thought occurred to me that we might actually be looking at one distinct object, but they were fairly high up and it was dark enough to make it dificult to tell for sure. A couple other things of note from this sighting: (1) it was very dificult to determine how fast and in which direction they were heading. I am also fairly certain they were not on a strait course. There appeared to be some back and forth movement in their route. (2) The lead object (or appeared to be the lead), disappeared about halfway through the sighting just as an additional object appeared back towards where we first noticed them. No idea if this additional object was the same object that moved very fast without us noticing or an entirely different object all together. (3) We heard absolutely zero sound coming from these objects even though they moved fast enough that it would be expected if they were using any human technology that I am aware of. At the end of the day, I still do not know what these things were, but I can say that I much more open to the possibility of there being something else out there that we are sharing this universe with. Hope someone out there has seen something similar and can share some information or at least theories.;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325
Bright Triangular Light Orb in the sky different flashing lights and appears closer each day.;2013-10-01 09:43:00;2 hours;Bright Triangular Light Orb in the sky different flashing lights and appears closer each day. I noticed like a fire ball triangle object in the sky it seemed as if it is getting closer every day it comes around the same time.  I also got several interesting pics.  Of some interesting looking creatures of some sort or orb type beings.   This is not a hoax thank you for being interested.  It hovers southwest Muncie, Indiana.;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325
