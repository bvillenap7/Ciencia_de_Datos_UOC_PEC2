Bright lights in the sky over Muncie Indiana;2006-01-25 22:30:00;A few Seconds;Bright lights in the sky over Muncie Indiana We were driving east of the city of Muncie on the way home from a friend's house, and witnessed a light in the sky moving downward toward the ground. The light then climbed quickly in altitude and fell in what looked as if it was a fireball. We were unable to locate the site it dissapeared to.We think this could have been a plane crash, as the wind was exceptionally strong tonite. From that period until about 1230AM, we heard and witnessed lowflying jets in the area going unusually slow.;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325
1 orb hovering in sky and exploding in a ball of blue light before disappearing.;2011-12-02 23:00:00;1 Hour;1 orb hovering in sky and exploding in a ball of blue light before disappearing. On December 2nd, 2011in Muncie, Indiana at around 11:00pm I witnessed   what I believe to be a Extra Terrestrial space craft fly across the sky at a tremendous speed then erupting into a ball of light and vanishing. I was not able to get any pictures or video because the encounter was so quick if I would have hesitated to look up into the sky I would have missed it. Earlier that day I had an intense feeling of being watched. It felt almost as if there was someone watching my every move through out the day. As I drove down the highway from Northern Indiana back down to Muncie I had noticed a blue orb hovering in the sky. At first I thought nothing of it thinking it was just a nearby radio tower or an airplane. As time progressed I kept looking up to see if it was still there and it was. Suddenly the orb started to move erratically in the sky and the light had gotten brighter and brighter the faster it moved. All of the sudden it shot forward in tremendous speed behind a cloud and all I could see after that was a large explosion of blue light. I have not seen the Space Craft since or had the feeling of being watched. The orb sat there hovering in the sky around 1 hour before darting off in 30 seconds or less.;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325
