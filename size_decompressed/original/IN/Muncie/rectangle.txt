((HOAX??))  Red  Rectangle object at constant speed that could not be described as a known thing in the air.;2007-02-24 16:00:00;about 2 mins;Red  Rectangle object at constant speed that could not be described as a known thing in the air. Was randomly looking up in the sky when i saw this strange object. I pointed out to two friends and their dad. They wernt paying much attention and said it was a bird or something. It was not though. I was big and red and was traveling not to fast, but went out of sight because of buildings. It was not a bird, balloon, or some type of glider or weather balloon. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.
