Two yellow disks adjacent with a silver white probe/extension from lead disk;2006-12-10 13:35:00;2 to 3 minutes;Two yellow disks adjacent with a silver white probe/extension from lead disk High altitude UFO over central Indiana  Date:  12/10/2006   Time: 1:35 PM  Sky conditions:  Blue sky with isolated cirrus clouds  I was in my backyard and looked up. WNW at approximately 80 degrees elevation, I saw a slow moving light (or sunlight reflection).  With 7x50 binocs, you could see two yellow disks tangent to each other. A silver white probe extended out from the lead disk in the direction of motion (toward the NE). The probe like extension was about the length of the two disks diameters. There was also another shorter extension parallel to the silver white one. The objects were in view for approximately 2 to 3 minutes until they were hidden by cirrus clouds in the NE. During the sighting, a commercial jet airliner flew over from East to West. The UFO appeared to be much higher than the jet. Because the UFO was above the cirrus cloud when it “disappeared”, and because of the resolution in the binocs, it’s my opinion this was a huge object or objects at very high altitude (60,000 to 70,000 feet). It is possible that the two disks could have been spheres, but they looked like disks to me.;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325
Dark saucer shaped craft with lights seen hovering over Ball State University.;2014-10-02 01:00:00;10 minutes;Dark saucer shaped craft with lights seen hovering over Ball State University I was walking down the street near Ball State University with some friends and I noticed a saucer shaped form in the night sky.  Although the sky was dark, the object was noticibly darker with 3-5 (I can't recall exactly) lights on the bottom half.  It appeared to be hovering in one spot on the sky a few hundred feet above the ground a mile or so away, but still looked pretty big.  Everyone with me saw it and believed it to be a UFO!
