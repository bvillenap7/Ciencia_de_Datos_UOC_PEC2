Photo of a jet flying overhead with an unknown;2007-03-05 09:35:00;Photo time;Photo of a jet flying overhead with an unknown Last Dec 2006, I was looking thru 7x50 binocs at a jet overhead.  There appeared to be a UFO near the jet.  In an effort to obtain objective evidence, I started taking digital pictures of randomly selected jets passing overhead. Then I examine the photos on my computer using the zoom enlargement option. Today (3/05/07 @ 9:35 AM), I took a picture of a jet with a possible UFO in the photo.  I did not see the UFO, but my Canon SD 630 recorded it.  The object appears to be viewed on edge with two black ports facing down.  Curved areas appear to be reflecting sunlight off metallic looking surfaces. Because of the detail in such a small image, I would say this was a very large object at high altitude.  Also in the picture is the jet which provides a good reference for image resolution. I will e-mail you the picture for your opinion. Sky conditions: Blue sky with some clouds in the area. Ground level conditions: Air temp 34F, slight or no wind. Viewed SW @ approx 80 degrees elevation;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325
Dark un-lit silent object moving NE across morning sky at low altitude;2014-09-05 07:10:00;20 seconds;Dark unlit silent object moving NE across morning sky at low altitude Morning hour dusky sky.  Object approx. 800 feet high traveling NE silently.  No lights, wings, rotors or other recognizable aircraft properties no markings discernable and no visible sheen or reflections.  Object traveled smoothly under what appeared to be a non-random manner.  Perhaps ~40 ft. in diameter or slightly larger.  Flat but not saucer-like - hard, angled edges alternating up and down, reminiscent of a metal ashtray design.  No contrail or emitted vapors detectable.  Driver ahead of me appeared to be recording object as she drove using a smartphone.;40.203854494382;-85.4034668539325
