((HOAX??))  Grey, triangle, but upside down, looked like cloud, but had straight edges.;2014-07-02 00:00:00;12:00;Grey, triangle, but upside down, looked like cloud, but had straight edges. It was like an upside down triangle.  But, it looked like a cloud, but the edges of it were straight. It was also on the left side of the moon and then eventually it went above a tree and disappeared.   Plus, I've believed in aliens and UFOs most of my life and I have never seen that in my entire life.  Also, I have seen one as a child, 10 years old. I was in the back door needing to feed my Doberman and I saw a HUGE, silver, 30 foot long UFO floating 15 feet above the road by the fence.  I freaked out!  I ran back inside and nothing else happened after that.  I'm 15 years old now.  To prove it, I was born on December 22, 1998.  I want someone to believe me, also my brother saw it, but my mom, dad, and two sisters won't believe me.  I'm afraid I'll get obducted.  I'm one of those people who will totally FREAK OUT if I get obducted.  Please believe me.  Thank you so much!;38.6905;-85.8028
