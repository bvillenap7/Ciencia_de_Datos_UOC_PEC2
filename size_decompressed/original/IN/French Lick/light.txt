Bright stationary light in the southern sky of southern Indiana.;2009-07-13 20:40:00;1 minute;Bright stationary light in the southern sky of southern Indiana. At  8:40 PM after I had gotten home from a date with my girlfriend, I was talking to my parents on our front porch when a bright flash caught my eye. I looked to the South sky to see a very bright light at about a 7-10 degree elevation. My parents were both asking me what it was, and asking if I saw any blue or red lights on the object (there weren’t from what I could see). As we were watching the object, it disappeared into thin air, and didn’t come back for as long as we were out there.	 The object was about twice the size of an average star, and was also about twice as bright. There was still sun on the horizon, and we couldn’t see any other stars at that time anyway. The object was completely stationary throughout the entire period.;38.538;-86.6121
