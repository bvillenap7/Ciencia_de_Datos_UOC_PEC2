Large brilliant light from craft over Charlestown, IN.;2004-03-03 03:30:00;>90 minutes;Large brilliant light from craft over Charlestown, IN. On the aforementioned date and time I took my dog outside (Nabb, IN) and started my car to let it warm up when I noticed what I thought was a Commercial Airplane with its landing lights on over Charlestown, IN.  I could not make out the shape of the craft but noticed it had no blinking lights or the usual red/green lights just a brilliant white light. Around 30 mins later I went out after the dog so I could leave for drill and the Naval Reserve Station in Louisville as I had ((deleted)) duty as a ((deleted)) and notice the light still there and knew it wasn't a conventional aircraft and thought to myself with some doubt that maybe it was Venus or some type of star. For the next 10 mins I drove out of view of the craft until reaching Market St. in Charlestown.   Once I passed the hospital I saw that the high school football field on my left about three blocks up was totally lit up and the craft was gone which was very odd at that time of year and 0345 am I pondered what in the world could be going on there. About 1 min later and much closer to the field, I suddenly saw, I will do my best to describe it: all the light in the stadium started dimming like it was being sucked in by a vacuum, until it all went into a white brilliant ball of light in the center of the field, and then shot upwards with great speed.   The ball looked almost exactly like the craft over The Temple Mount and i was flabbergasted and proclaimed all ritey then!   I saw no vehicles on the streets at all but surely someone especially the police had to see the massive light over the stadium.  I mean the odds would be impossible. Someone me that you seriously saw this stuff, Please!;38.4549999999999;-85.6608
