Heard low flying helicopters coming fast toward me, looked up toward sound and saw this ufo.  ((anonymous report));2016-06-23 20:30:00;30 seconds;Middle of summer standing on my deck hearing low flying helicopters comming fast toward me, looked up toward sound and saw this ufo.  The craft was almost invisible, but I could make out its shape and all 4 helicopters total black and no lights flying with or chasing it.   Days later got up my nerve to talk about this with my neighbor, and he told me he had seen the same thing and was afraid to tell anyone.   Almost 2 yeas later here I am telling the story.
