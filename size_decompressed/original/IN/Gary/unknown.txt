A lime green light throughout the whole house and the air stone surged with power throwing water 2 feet in the air.;1986-06-15 23:30:00;1 or2 minutes;A lime green light throughout the whole house and the air stone surged with power throwing water 2 feet in the air. ATTN: Peter Davenport On or about 16 years ago, during the summer, my husband and I had returned home at 11 p.m.(maybe even a little later).  We noticed that our home lit up in this lime green light (like fllod lights were on in the house), in our living room we had a fish tank, and the air stone surged in power and was throwing the water as high as 2 ft. out of the tank.  Then when the light stopped the air stone went back to normal.  We had thought the high lines might have been struck, but when we asked the electric company, they said no.  I asked different people, line men, supervisors, etc...and they all said it had nothing to do with the lines.  This happened outside Gary Indiana in a single dwelling, inside was my husband and I, my 30 year old daughter who was taking care of a 2 1/2 year old boy, and my 16 year old daughter.  My 30 year old daughter can confirm this.  Please keep this confidential, like we talked about (name).  Add to your records only!   I feel this should be noted that this happened, so if someone else this has happened to knows that they are not alone. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.

The object that was observed piqued my interest, and I searched for other blinking lights that would give it away as either a helicopter or jumbo/private jet.  These other lights were not found.  I told my passenger to check it out, to see if he could make out the object better than I could. Eventually even another passenger in the back seat witnessed the object, but could still not determine its origin, nor identify what it was, except for the fact that it was very bright.  Shortly afterward, the object disappeared into a cloud, and as we all waited for it to emerge, the light shining through the aforementioned clouds dimmed and was suddenly extinguished. Note: All observers are males age 21-25 with college-level educations and above-average intellects.;41.5771123076923;-87.3441692307692
