Large Dark Circular Object Hovering Over Highway;2002-08-24 04:28:00;5 seconds;Large Dark Circular Object Hovering Over Highway Me and a friend were heading from Grand Rapids, Michigan to Chicago, Illinois Saturday morning to spend the weekend there.  We were just outside of Gary, Indiana at 4:28am when I happened to look up in the sky and noticed a dark, very large circular object hovering over the highway just ahead of us.  As we approached, I expected it to move, but it was stationary as we drove right under it.  Unfortunately my friend who was driving had his eyes on the road and missed the whole thing.  There were no lights or sound at all.  It was about the size of a frisbee at arms length, so it was either very close to the ground or very large.  Our headlights did not illuminate the bottom of the object at all, so I'm thinking it was pretty large.;41.5771123076923;-87.3441692307692
