white geometrically moving lights on a stationary craft over Gary, IN;2007-06-22 23:15:00;1:45;white geometrically moving lights on a stationary craft over Gary, IN It was a cloudy evening.  And the two witnesses living a mile apart could see 4 fast moving lights (north, south, east and west) that would move, bump each other and go back apart.  It was like the spokes on a wheel.  The lights would make a small turn and go back into the center of the 'wheel'. When the lights would 'bump' (in the center) they would stay lit.  It was absolutely nothing like a search light. From the ground using the naked eye, it appeared that the lights were about 4 -5 feet in diameter. The lights were a soft white with lots of movement inside of the actual light. There was no sound at all.;41.5771123076923;-87.3441692307692

I saw a dozen or so lights some moving some still. Some were blinking and some were solid. a few were red in color and  they varied in intensity. I was on the southern shore of Lake Michigan looking north.;41.5771123076923;-87.3441692307692
