Three triangular glowing lights flying very slowly toward the horizon (I-90 West outside Gary, Indiana);2004-08-19 20:00:00;45-60 seconds;Three triangular glowing lights flying very slowly toward the horizon (I-90 West outside Gary, Indiana) Traveling West on I-90 toward Chicago, somewhere between Gary and Hammond, I saw three isoceles triangle shaped, glowing lights that had a bright, pinkish-white hue and a lighted trail. What caught my eye was their shape, large size relative to their location in the sky, and slow movement toward the horizon. It was completely unlike the typical lights from aircraft flying at night there was no blinking or flickering, and the size and shape indicated three separate movements. The lights appeared to be moving in formation. My friend and I watched and were very aware that what we were looking at was extremely unusual. We even thought about watching the news that night to see if any unusual sightings were reported. The three lights slowly dimmed and disappeared. I searched the sky for about ten minutes afterward and saw no sign of them. When we got into Chicago, we learned that the air show was taking place that weekend, which we figured might have been the cause (although we both maintained this did not resemble airplane flight).  When we first saw the lights my friend was talking on her cell phone with perfect reception. Suddenly the connection completely failed. After the lights were gone she redialed and had a perfect connection once again.  I had not forgotten the event and when I came across this website and saw the large number of reports in and around the Chicago area for that weekend, I felt our experience was validated. ((NUFORC Note:  The sightings occurred in Chicago on August 21st, not August 19.  We will correspond with the witness to inquire whether the date indicated above is correct.

Five black triangular ships sighted in Gary, Indiana city limits close enough for me to get a clear view of what they looked like;2008-01-16 20:00:00;5 min.;Five black triangular ships sighted in Gary, Indiana city limits close enough for me to get a clear view of what they looked like i was standing outside of my friends house and where they live it is surrounded by trees and bushes but the clearing is circular .(not sure if that's relative) i was looking upward east as i like to look at the stars formations but particularly eastward the sky was cloudy. It seemed like seconds passed when three craft came through opening the clouds zig zagging towards the area i was standing in.The ships stopped and lined up and waited, and two more ships came straight down and aligned themselves with the first three. They were triangular and black with orange light behind them, they were right above the trees close enough for me to see the shape, the color and lines that looked like how the ships were built.I'm positive they werent stealth planes because they don't stop in the air on a dime and they don't zig zag left to right. Also the ships made no sound and no vibration even though they were dangerously close. the ships turned to the south and slowly moved away over the trees. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));41.5771123076923;-87.3441692307692

We were driving, when he caught my attention and asked what it was.  My husband and I drive a truck across country.  We were driving when he caught my attention and asked what it was.   At first I thought it was nothing then it was just hovering there and I took pictures.  It was three oval shaped crafts flying in a perfect triangle.   And above them was a flat bottomed something.  I'm not sure what it was.  Traffic backed up to look at it though.;41.5771123076923;-87.3441692307692
