A huge Object with about 22 lights rotating counter clock wise moving, hovering, and then vanishing North of Hamilton County Indiana!!!;2008-04-16 10:37:00;3 Minutes;A huge Object with about 22 lights rotating counter clock wise moving, hovering, and then vanishing North of Hamilton County Indiana!!! I live in Westfield and was outside with my friends and just happened to look up and I seen this object come down from the sky diagonally.  It was one solid object because the individual lights were perfectly aligned.  It leveled itself out and just kind of hovered for about 20 seconds or so.  While all this was happening the lights on the object were rotating counter-clockwise.  It then took back off up toward the sky and so fast... it just vanished.  I live about 20 miles from where this happened.  I was just far enough to know that it wasn't a bunch of little objects.  It was not a flare.  We would have never been able to see a F16 from there esp. in the night.  We could tell it was one big object with about 15 to 25 lights.  I would imagine that if you were anywhere close to the site like 5 miles or so it would look like a fireball, but it wasn't we were had a perfect look at it.  By the time we got out camera phones loaded up the thing was long gone.   Also, the local news talked about sending heli's up to the scene, but I didn't see any of them headed that way. They also said it was F16's last night.  This morning they said it was meteor showers. Now they are saying it was F16's.  F16's are not allowed to break the sound barrier and why would they do a training mission around a residential area?  Things are not adding up. I am the biggest sceptic of them all... and after last night I don't think  I will look at the sky the same anymore.   What we witnessed last night was no man made aircraft!!!  No Way No How!!!   I am always the person that has too see it to believe it... buddy I seen it and I know in my heart it wasn't anything close to normal.;40.0537999999999;-86.1432999999998
