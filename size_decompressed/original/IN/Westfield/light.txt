Amber Orbs;2006-08-04 22:14:00;2 seconds;While traveling northbound toward SR32, I saw two amber orbs on the northern horizon. The lights were positioned very close to each other in a diagonal formation. The top orb disappeared and then the bottom orb did the same. This is the third time I have seen these lights over the last 4 years. These amber lights look exactly like the Phoenix Lights except on a smaller scale.
