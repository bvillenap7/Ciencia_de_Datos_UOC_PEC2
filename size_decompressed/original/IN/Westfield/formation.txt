4 bright white orbs in line formation near intersection of SR 38 & US 31 near Westfield, IN.;2004-02-03 21:30:00;30 seconds;4 bright white orbs in line formation near intersection of SR 38 & US 31 near Westfield, IN. I was driving north on US 31 just south of the SR 38 & US 31 intersection at approx. 9:30 pm. The sky was clear.  In the northwest section of the sky, I saw four circular lights lined in a horizontal line from west to east. The orbs appeared to be bright whiteish yellow. The orbs were about 5 times larger and brighter than any star I have seen.  The orbs didn't move. Each orb was visible for about 30 seconds and then from east to west one-by-one the lights went out.  I have traveled that route daily for the past 12 years. I have never seen anything like it before or since. I enjoy amateur astronomy and have lived near Grissom AFRB for decades. I very am familiar with the nighttime appearance of stars, planets, meteorites, flares and aircraft. What I saw that night was unique to my experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Two orange glowing orbs speed across sky in formation.;2012-03-21 20:00:00;3-5 seconds;Two orange glowing orbs speed across sky in formation. I was standing out siding on our balcony by myself smoking a cigarette.  To my amazement, (as I actually said whoa out loud), two glowing red-orange orbs of light shot across the sky.  Our place is facing South, so, these objects flew in from the Southwest due North. These two objects flew in a perfectly horizontal path.  They flew in a staggered formation with one appearing to be above the other, but slightly in front.  These objects left no trail like a meteor would.  The light was a constant self emitted warm orange glow with sharp edges.  The objects raced across the sky with incredible speed.  It took probably no more than 3 seconds to cover the extent of my view in the horizon before they flew behind our home and out of site.  These were no meteors.  They appeared to be intelligently controlled.  The best way to describe the size of the objects in the sky would be to say if you held a lit cigarette as far from your face as possible in the dark against the sky, that little orange glow is about the size of the two objects seen racing across the sky. I am a licensed professional business owner in the state of Indiana.  This report was originally submitted to MUFON a few days after the occurrence.  I have submitted here after Mr. Davenports visit on Coast to Coast AM the other evening.  He mentioned there has been somewhat of a phenomenon of these sitings.
