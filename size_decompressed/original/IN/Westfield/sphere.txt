One of my family members was coming down my street on his way back to the house from the local gas station wile I was out side smoking a cigarette.  He got out of his car and told me to fallow him down to the street corner. We walked down to the corner and there it was a bluish white ball of light moving around slowly by the moon. My family member went to get another family member as I stood there watching the u.f.o.   They got back to where I was.  I called my bubby to tell him to come outside and look at the sky. He saw the craft moving as well. We then went back inside.  About an hour later my family member decided to go back out to look at it some more I fallowed him out and this time we saw two.  One was flying over head at a tremendous speed.  The other was moving in the opposite direction at a much slower speed.;40.0537999999999;-86.1432999999998
