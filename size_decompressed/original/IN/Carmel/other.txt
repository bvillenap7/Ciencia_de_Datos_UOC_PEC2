Low flying, horizontally flashing strobe lights. (Reminescent of CE3K);2008-09-18 20:55:00;3 minutes;Low flying, horizontally flashing strobe lights. (Reminescent of CE3K) 9/18/2008, Carmel, Indiana (39.978 N, 86.118 W).  Clear, dark sky. Walking my dog, I glanced westward and noticed a set of lights well below normal flight path for area airports. We are approx. 12 miles from Indianapolis Intâ€™l, and 5 miles from Indianapolis Executive airports.  We are on no flight path for either, but can observe final approach from our location.  4 to 6 brilliant white strobe lights, flashing in random horizontal pattern, no top or bottom red lights, no navigation lights, were moving rapidly, approaching from west.  First observed 20:55.  Looked again after crossing street and they were much closer and at same relative altitude (neither ascending nor descending). We walked around a 2-story building, looked west in a 50-foot gap between buildings and the lights were much closer still.  We returned to our original position, and the lights were gone.  No engine noise was ever heard.  No lateral motion it moved in a straight line directly toward us from due West. Call to Executive Airport established no arrivals in the appropriate time frame.;39.9717430127043;-86.1241718693277
