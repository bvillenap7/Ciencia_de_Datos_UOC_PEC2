At approximately 21:15 on August 27th, 2011, I and one other witness saw a spherical unidentified flying object for a duration of approximately one minute.  This craft was a pulsating Orange-Red spherical object, and it made its way across the sky in the North to South direction.  Its speed was approximately that of a commercial airliner.  The UFO disappeared from sight after its lights were seen dimming for approximately 10 seconds.;39.9717430127043;-86.1241718693277
Five orange lights over Carmel, Indiana.;2014-07-19 22:00:00;5 minutes;Five orange lights over Carmel Indiana It was the end of a long work day, when a co-worker and I were walking out to the parking lot, joking about how he was going to be picked up by a helicopter.   As I looked to the Eastern sky I saw a large orange light hovering about 800 feet, or so, above the ground.  I pointed at it and my co-worker, laughed, and said, There it is now  As I watched the object for a few seconds, I saw another orange light fade into view near the original, so I start walking in their direction.  While I'm walking, I see another appear the very same way the second did, then another, then another (5 in total).   At this point, I've passed up my car and started jogging down 129th Street from Gray Road, towards Hazel Dell Road, where the lights seemed to be hovering.   Just as I moved past the tree line and into a clearing, I saw the bright orange lights very clear as they all started to move east in unison as if they were many parts of a whole.   They stayed on that course for another 10! seconds or so when they faded back into the dark night sky.;39.9717430127043;-86.1241718693277
