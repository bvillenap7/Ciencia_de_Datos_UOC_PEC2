Saw an object in the sky over some trees, object appeared to be falling rapidly maybe crashing, then object slowly glided down into some fields. This was observed in a dark sky between 8:30-9:15pm. The object was very small not much bigger than a van and had red lights surrounding it, it appeared to be round. Once object was on the ground lights were no longer visible. Object was flying in a residential area, no airports etc. around. only homes and corn fields. No sounds were heard although I was driving at the time when observing it. Last year between October and December I observed what I thought was a meteor falling in the same area over the trees where I first observed this object in the sky.
