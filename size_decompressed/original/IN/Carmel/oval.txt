A oval star-like very bright thing quite close to the horizon.  It was similar to the pinkish orange of Mars and much larger even at Mars closest point.  It radiated a kind of glow.  I watched it for about 4 or so minutes and it never moved (I had it between 2 wires for placement).  All of a sudden it went up like the opposite of a shooting star! Now this was a very clear night. I could see tons of stars and planes (there was a lot of air traffic).  I am very familiar with the flight path as I am out back every night I am in town.  This object was low to the ground and about 15 -20 degrees east of due north.;39.9717430127043;-86.1241718693277

At first we thought it was a spider shaped balloon, but it was not floating. Instead it was like hovering pretty fast.
