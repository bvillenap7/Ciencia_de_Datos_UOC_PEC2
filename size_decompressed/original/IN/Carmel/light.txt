On several occasions have noticed a bright light to the south west.  Thought it was venus, however, this evening there were no other stars visible.  In addition, I did see a jet approaching Indianapolis from the east  and it was clearly moving.  The bright light (or lights) I saw disappeared after about an hour although another set of lights, directly above but much higher, were still visible.  I'm not sure what the object(s) were because 1) they did not move 2) the one set of lights disappeared and 3) no other lights (e.g., stars, planets, etc.) were visible in the night sky other than the jet that I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus currently is quite prominent in the southwest sky at the time indicated.  PD));39.9717430127043;-86.1241718693277
Orange light moving E to W at high altitude, red beacon visible after passing overhead;2009-09-08 21:31:00;1 minute;Orange light moving E to W at high altitude, red beacon visible after passing overhead 9-08-2009 21:31 EDT 39.9624°N, 86.1194°W  I observed an object pass overhead at the referenced coordinates, orange, and about the same apparent size (perhaps 20% larger), magnitude, and color of Antares. First observed about 60°elevation E. of zenith, as an orange light.  After it passed directly overhead, a red flashing beacon was occasionally visible, but no strobes and no navigation lights.  It traversed my entire 100° field of view in under 1 minute. At the time of the observation, there were 2 commercial airliners passing to the south, one going East, the other, West.  The aircraft was much higher and faster than either.  I could not hear any engine noise after it passed overhead.  (Generally, I can hear engine noise a few seconds after airliners pass overhead due to the speed of sound (1,100’/min.), and can guess their distance accordingly.)  I heard the engines of the airliners after they’d passed. We are near the Indianapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZID).  This did not resemble any airliner I’ve seen passing at night. I suspect that the orange light was due to sunlight reflecting off the fuselage, but sunset was at 20:05. 1.  How high did this aircraft have to be, to be able to reflect sunlight 1.5 hours after sunset? 2.	What type of aircraft was this?  (I suspect military, am unsure of size or type.)   (The ISS, Cosmos 1844 and Resurs 1-4 objects were visible within a few minutes of this, but on different tracks and of different magnitudes.);39.9717430127043;-86.1241718693277
