It was not distant, but very close and large!  Triangular in shape with flash in the rear, greater on the outer edges than center.  The entire shape seemed to be lit.   It may have been white flame shooting from the back of the object and I am certain there was a flash of blue in the center.  There was no tail to speak of so I am fairly certain it was not a comet, afterall.  Maybe a military vehicle?  So peculiar.  I do wish I'd had my camera.  I live 3 1/2 miles south of Spencer on Pottersville Rd.  Is there anything you know about this that you might share with me?  No sound.  So strange.  I watched it pass with amazement and wonder.  Because we are surrounded by tree lines on all sides the viewing area was limited.  After it passed beyond the treeline, there was some distant flashes in the sky but this could have been heat lightening, although I did not notice them prior to the sighting.  Thinking about it all night makes me certain it was not a comet at all (my initial thought) because there was definite structure to the object.  Were I to associate it with something familiar, that something would be a stealth because of form and light that would resemble fuel flash feathering from the rear.  As well, I did see what appeared to be a comet after turning away from this sighting, shooting off in a different direction, from a different direction..  if the two sightings occurred simultaneously, they would have made an X over my front yard!  The second sighting did seem to be a comet, lower than most I have witnessed, but definitely the shape, oval, with a short tail, white, without any deviating signs of being otherwise.  What a night!  I hope you will reply.;39.285;-86.7813
