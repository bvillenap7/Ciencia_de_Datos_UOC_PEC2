Indiana glowing shape shifting orb;2019-06-18 19:00:00;2.5 hours;Indiana glowing shape shifting orb. We were looking at the roof line of our house and noticed a white object directly overhead.  We believed it to be an aircraft but it appeared to be stationary.  I took photos and video . I went and got my binoculars in order to get a better view, we first observed it to be white with a gey dot in it.  After about 15 minutes it then looked like a ying-yang with the grey dot still visible in the upper left part of the object.   After several minutes of trying to take a photo with the binoculars over my phone camera I observed it as white with a grey line though it diagonally and the grey circle in the upper left part of the object. The last hour of observation was difficult due to increasing cloud cover. The object moved from directly over our house  to about 35 due west over the span of two and a half hours. I verified on my skywatcher app that there wer no celestial bodies or satellites in the area. Photos to be sent.;39.9246;-85.1597
