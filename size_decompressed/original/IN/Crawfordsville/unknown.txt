THE LIGHTS SEEMED TO BE ON 1 OBJECT ABOUT 2 MILES NORTHWEST OF ME AND WAS TRAVELING AT A SPEED A BIT LESS THAN MINE, I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 65.THIS WAS AT MILE MARKER 41 AT 21:16. I OBSERVED THESE PRETTY MUCH CONTINIOUS TO MILE MARKER 29, AT THAT TIME THE LIGHTS WERE DIRECTLY NORTH OF ME AND BEGAN TRAVELING SOUTH AS I COULD SEE THEM IN THE UPPER THIRD OF MY PASSANGER SIDE WINDOW. THIS IS WHEN I COULD SEE A DARK FORM BETWEEN THE TOP LIGHT AND THE LOWER 3 LIGHTS, IT SEEM TO BE A BELL SHAPE. IT CONTINUED TOWARD MY TRUCK UNTIL IT WAS CLOSE ENOUGH THAT I COULD NOT SEE IT OUT MY WINDOW, LIKE IT WAS PASSING OVER ME, BUT I LOOKED AND NEVER SPOTTED IT TO THE SOUTH OR BEHIND ME, AS I DROVE ON TO THE WEST ABOUT 3 MILES LATER I NOTICED ANOTHER SET  OF LITES SIMILAR TO THE FIRST SET, THESE WERE ALSO TO THE NORTH AND SEEMED TO BE TRAVELING AWAY TO THE NORTHWEST, THEY WERE ALSO TRAVELING SLOWLY. I OBSERVED THEM FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES, THEN THEY SEEMED TO REVERSE THEIR DIRECTION OF TRAVEL, NOT TURNING AROUND MORE LIKE BACKING UP. WHEN THESE LITES GOT LIKE FROM JUDGING FROM THE TREE LINES IN THE DISTANCE , I SAY ABOUT A HALF MILE NORTH OF ME AND LESS THAN 1000FEET OFF THE GROUND, ALL THEIR LITES WENT OUT FOR A SECOND OR 2, THEN ABOUT WHERE THE 3 BOTTOM LITES HAD BEEN THERE WAS A SEQUENCE OF 5 0R 6 STROBE LITES, FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, TWICE, THEN ONE BRIGHT FLASH FROM THE LEFT END AND RIGHT END LITES. THEN NOTHING, IT JUST WASNT THERE.;40.0346;-86.907
