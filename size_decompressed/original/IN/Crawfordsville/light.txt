Thirteen red lights travel same path over Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana.;2012-06-18 23:00:00;5 minutes;Thirteen red lights travel same path over Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana. I was sitting on my front porch and looked up into the sky above Wabash College and thought I saw a plane -- just looked like the red light but without the &quotblinker.&quot  About 10 seconds later, another followed....and then another....and then another.  Thirteen in all from the time I started counting, all following the same path.  No sound of plane/jet engines, and three simply disappeared (although they could have merely gone behind a cloud as it was partly cloudy that night). ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.0346;-86.907
