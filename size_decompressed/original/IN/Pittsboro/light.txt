It was a nice day and my friend and I had just finished watching a movie.  We decided to go outside. The sky was bright orange.  I looked aproxamently to the north.  there was a bright orange-ish yellow ball in a clearing of the clouds, at first I thought it was a plane.  After it stayed there for over ten minuits I fianaly realized what I was seeing could possibly be a UFO.  I am still wondering what it was, I figured you might want to know.
