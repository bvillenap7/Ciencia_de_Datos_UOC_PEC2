Metal orb of wires that was seen through a telescope after noticing a bright light that hovered in the sky. ((anonymous report));2019-06-18 21:00:00;1 hour;Metal orb of wires that was seen through a telescope after noticing a bright light that hovered in the sky for about an hour. Noticed a light in the sky that looked like an airplane, but never moved.  Proceeded to get telescope out and noticed a sphere that looked as if it was made out of wires.  Also noticed 2 black things inside of the center or at times one black thing and a tail on it.  No lights were on it and once the sun went over the horizon it was very hard to see.  There was 3 other of these lights in the sky very far apart from each other.   The whole incident lasted a whole hour but I am sure it was there for half an hour more at least.
