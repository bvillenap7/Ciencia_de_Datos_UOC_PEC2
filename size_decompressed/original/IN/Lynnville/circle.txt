Cemetery UFO sighting;2003-12-19 00:00:00;unknown;Cemetery UFO sighting I was out at a local cemetery, alone, taking some photographs because I had nothing else to do at the time.  I've visited the cemetery several times because I ghost hunt and its a really nice, rural area where the sky, on a clear night, is very pretty.  As I said, I was taking some photographs and looking up, it was partly cloudy and I noticed one or two conventional aircraft in the sky and identified them by their red/white flashing lights as well as some sound.  The other object appeared and looked to be higher in the sky than the other aircraft, however also appeared to be larger.  I didn't think anything of it first and went on with what I was doing.  About 10-20 minutes later I was ready to leave and looked up to see that the object was in the same spot, while the other aircraft were no longer visible.  After that, I left and didn't think anything more about the incident until I heard about the website on Coast to Coast and decided to report it.;38.1944;-87.2968
