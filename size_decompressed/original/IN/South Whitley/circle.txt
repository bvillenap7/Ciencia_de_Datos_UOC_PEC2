Green light in sky.;2015-01-22 07:00:00;minutes;Green light in sky. It was on 1/22/15 around 7am, my husband and I were heading down IN 14 east towards Fort Wayne, Indiana.  Between the county line of Kosciusko and Whitley county.   I was watching the fields off to the right looking for deer.  I noticed a green light in the sky.  I didn't think nothing of it until we passed a large areas of trees and was wide open to some fields.  Not really moving fast just a steady moving.  It was above the large power line but lower than the clouds.   At first, I thought it was a plane but the longer I looked at it the less it had the attributes of a plane.  There was no blinking lights.  No red or white lights.  I thought how strange that a plane so low in the sky.   As my husband drove on, he asked what I was staring at.  I explained to him a green object in the sky.   He kinda poked down and looked over, as we kept driving down IN 14, I watched it slowly glide across the sky behind us.   A few hours later on the ride home we passed the same field and we looked around, thinking a tower of some sort or lights on top of the power lines, but we could see nothing. Just a house and power lines then open fields.   I'm not sure what we saw.  It just seemed a little odd to me.;41.073;-85.6109
