Bumbbell shaped ship sighted. Beings onboard!;2000-04-10 10:00:00;30 seconds;Bumbbell shaped ship sighted. Beings onboard! I was driving to work around 10:00am. It was April of 2000. The sky was overcast with loght grey clouds. As I was making my way around a curve in the road, something caught my eye. Something very large was moving very slowly just cross the tree tops. I slowed down even more to get a good look at this thing. I stopped and hung in the air over the road about 30 yards in front of me. I stopped to look at it. It was dark grey. About 50 feet long. (The road is about 25 feet wide, and this thing was more than twice that long.) The shape put me in mind of a dumbbell. Larger sphears on each end with a narrower cylendar like center. Each end had a window that was about 5 feet high and went the width of more than half of the radius. The center cylendar also had a like window down the side. The out side of the ship was made up of triangle panles. In the window I could see at least 3 beings looking at me. The one turned his head to another, then quickly looked back at me. the other one moved very fast to the other end of the ship. I could see him through the windows. Then the ship took off with amazing speed. I hit the gas to see if I could tell where it was going. It shot off at tree top level, then made a curve up to the sky. The ship went from standing still to vanishing in less than 3 seconds. I have thought of this everyday from that moment on. I have told a few people, but it sounds kind of crazy, so I have not brought it up. Has anybody seen anything like this? It made no sounds. No lights. Nothing.
