Floating object over our backyard;2004-01-03 23:45:00;3 minutes;Floating object over our backyard I saw an object coming toward our house going west. It had 1 row of white lights at the top and 1 row of white lights on the bottom.In the center were 2 rows of red lights. It was silently flying lower than a tall tree. The object was so strange that I asked my husband to take a look. He saw the object turn left then right and go north toward Lake Michigan. As it turned, he saw 3 lights at the front (yellow, green, and brown). It rose to around 300 feet and flew out of his sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
