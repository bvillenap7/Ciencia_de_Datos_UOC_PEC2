large, triangle shaped craft in the sky;2008-12-02 20:00:00;2 min;large, triangle shaped craft in the sky I was driving home and I noticed a strange object in the sky above the cornfield across from my neighborhood.  It was moving very slow to the north towards Chicago.  It was a triangle shape with bright red lights at each tip.  I pulled over to the side of the road to get a better look, and I could see distinctly a triangle shaped craft.   I didn't hear any noises, so I know for sure this wasn't an airplane, and I have seen this object once before a couple months ago in the exact same area.  This time, it was closer to the road.  I managed to get a couple pictures of it on my cell phone.  After a minute or two, the object dissapeared in the sky. It was very scary, I'm still shaking!;41.4250690265486;-87.3567999999999
