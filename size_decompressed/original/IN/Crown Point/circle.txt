Red glowing circular object moving laterally South to North with no sound (about the size of an aircraft);2011-10-22 20:45:00;3 - 5 min.;Red glowing circular object moving laterally South to North with no sound (about the size of an aircraft) On October 22, 2011 at approximately 8:45 p.m., my husband and I were outside of our home and observed a bright red glowing red oval/circular object in the sky moving laterally South to North.  It was as large as an aircraft but made no sound whatsoever.  At first I thought it was a glowing balloon or lantern (but more circular in shape), but it did not ascend and moved laterally instead.  My husband usually has an answer for everything, but not for this!!  I have noticed upon doing an on-line search that others witnessed a similar object in our area (10/18 in Munster, IN, as noted on the MUFON site and 10/8 in Crown Point, IN on UFO's Northwest site).  We've never believed in paranormal activity, including UFO's, but this was so unusual would love more information!;41.4250690265486;-87.3567999999999

We watched them and then looked east again to see four more, then one more.     He looked at them through his binoculars and said they were round and looked like they were on fire.     There was no sound.     We watched them for about five minutes until they went behind the clouds and disappeared, just about one by one.
