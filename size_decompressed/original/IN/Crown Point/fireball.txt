Two firballs or meteors seen low in the sky southwest of Crown Point, IN;2001-11-22 16:15:00;20 mins.;Two firballs or meteors seen low in the sky southwest of Crown Point, IN There were 2 large firball like ufo's seen in the light of day.  They were southwest in location and low in the horizon.  They were very bright and left smokey dark black trails behind them.  They moved very slowly downward over a 20 minute time-period.  We have no idea exactly what they were but they were very bright and so slow that we knew they were not planes so figure they must be meteors or fireballs.  We were so excited and didn't know who to inform of these strange sightings.  Glad to have found this website!  My husband and I are 40 years old and my daughter is 9 years old.  We looked at the fireballs with binoculars.;41.4250690265486;-87.3567999999999
