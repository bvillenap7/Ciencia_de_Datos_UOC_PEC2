Sighting of disk-shape object, lost time,  possible after-effects.;1987-08-20 23:00:00;unknown;Sighting of disk-shape object, lost time,  possible after-effects. Myself & a date were driving home and were approximately 2 blocks from my house, when the car stopped in front of what was at that time a corn field.  All I remember is looking to my right out the window and seeing a large disk-shaped object hovering approximately 50 feet in the air over the field.  I could only see the underside of the object,  but it was radiating a pink light which lit up the whole car.  I remember a very powerful vibrating humming sound which sent a numbing & tingling sensation thru my body almost like what I imagine an electric shock would feel like.  I turned my head away from the object to look at my date saying, Oh my God... as I turned my head, and it felt like I was moving and speaking in slow-motion.  I remember nothing else except that I arrived home at approximately 1:30am,  and do not recall how I got home or what happened.  I never spoke of that night to anyone until about 5 years ago,  and I only told my mother and 2 of my closest friends.  Since that time I have ran into the person I was with,  but have never had the courage to ask him about that night,  because it sounds so crazy.  Since that time, I have experienced what a neurologist told me is probably a sleep disorder called sleep paralysis.  I will be on the verge of sleep,  but still aware of what is going on around me and I get a buzzing sound in my head,  which progressively gets louder and louder,  then what feels like an electric wave runs thru my body causing that same tingling & numbness feeling that I experienced that night.  When this happens,  I am completely paralyzed,  then I don't remember anything else.  I either pass out or fall asleep or something.  This happened approximately every 3 months until the last year, during which time it seems to have stopped. I am very skeptical,  and have anylized this,  wondering if it really happened or if it was a dream, yet it is still so vivid & such a strong sensation.  I am an educated person, am not delusional,  and am of very sound mind,  but yet when I sp! eak of w hat I saw,  it sounds crazy,  even to myself. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We know nothing about sleep paralysis, although it frequently is cited as a source of suspected UFO abductions.  We observe that UFO abductions could be an adequate explanation for the phenomenon of sleep paralysis.  PD));41.4250690265486;-87.3567999999999
