Bright orange orbs moving from south to north, from slow to fast, and disappearing into clouds.;2013-04-27 20:45:00;~ 2 minutes;Bright orange orbs moving from south to north, from slow to fast, and disappearing into clouds. On 27 April at approximately 8:45 p.m. I looked out my patio doors in Crown Point, IN and noticed an orange light at an approximate 60Â° angle of elevation.   I am a former U. S. Air Force weather observer and I live on a golf course and the back of my house has in unobstructed view. I went outside into the backyard to get a better view.  There were four (4) circular bright orange orbs moving north easterly across the sky.   They were lined up in a straight line and their movement was slow on approach.  I got my binoculars to get a closer look at the orange orbs, they were not airplanes.  Then I thought they might have been helicopters, but there was absolutely no noise.  Then they moved northwest, and the first light sped up and disappeared into the clouds.  Then the second one sped up and disappeared.  The third followed and then the fourth.  According to the weather service in Gary, Indiana, the winds were calm and visibility was 15 miles with overcast skies.;41.4250690265486;-87.3567999999999
