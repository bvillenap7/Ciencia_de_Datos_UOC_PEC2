Shaft of pulsing light in Crown Point, Indiana;2007-02-11 00:20:00;20 Mins;Shaft of pulsing light in Crown Point, Indiana For approx. 20 minutes I witnessed a shaft of very bright pulsing light in the eastern sky.  It appeared only in the clouds and it appeared to be massive.  I also noticed several other cloud-like shafts in the area that were perpendicular to the normal clouds that were present.   The normal clouds were thin fluffy type.  The cloud-like shafts were solid.  I am a night person who spends a lot of time (usually from midnight to 4 am CDT), especially in the summer, watching the night sky.  I have seen several UFO's (crafts) starting in the early 80's.  I have seen the Northern Lights several times.  I am an avid watcher of meteor showers.   I have never witnessed a light like this.  I live in the flight path of O'Hare &/or Midway airports. There are always planes in the sky even in the middle of the night. There have been no planes in the sky for at least the last 30 to 40 minutes.  Not sure if that is worth mentioning but I thought it was strange.  I am submitting this report and then will be watching to see if this phenomena returns.;41.4250690265486;-87.3567999999999
Silent, bright, red/orange lights fly over Northwestern Indiana.;2014-05-31 21:05:00;20 minutes;Silent, bright, red/orange lights fly over Northwestern Indiana. Beginning at approximately 9:05 P.M., CST, several round, bright, single, red/orange lights flew over, from horizon to horizon.  Most flew in pairs, with one light following another.  Each pair would fly over and out of sight, and then another pair would fly over shortly after.   We saw a total of 8 or 9 of these lights over the course of about 15-20 minutes.  The strange thing about them was that they were very bright and did not blink, but at times appeared to flicker slightly.   There also seemed to be an area of more diffuse light immediately surrounding the bright light.  The light was equally bright viewed from all directions.   Hard to say how close they were, but they seemed fairly close as they went by, and no sound was heard.   Different from any other aircraft I have ever seen.  I shot a short video clip of the last one that flew over.;41.4250690265486;-87.3567999999999
2 orange spheres seen by 4 people over Crown Point, In.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is engineer and former Air Traffic Controller.  PD));2014-08-23 21:00:00;2 minutes;2 orange spheres seen by 4 people over Crown Point, In. On the evening of August 23, 2014, between 9 and 10 pm CST, 4 people observed 2 glowing spheres outside of Crown Point, Indiana. The spheres glowed/flickered orange/red, and moved slowly and silently from approximately North to South.  Size, speed and altitude unknown but would assume they were at least some feet across and low,  no more than say 1,000 feet in altitude (my impression).  They could have been more than just a few feet but I do not believe they were small aircraft size. At first, the objects were at some distance from each other and just “floating along,” something like you would expect from a Chinese lantern, which they resembled.  Then the lead object seemed to slow, or the other speed up as they joined up at a point in the sky.  Not conjoined or linked, just close to each other in formation. They then changed direction and moved West in close proximity to each other and we lost sight of them as they passed our house and I had to move from the back porch to the front. When I went out to the front yard the spheres had disappeared.  However, as I scoured the night sky I did see one blacked out sphere (no lights now) silhouetted against the night sky, returning back East from the direction it had come.  I did not see a second, nor did I try to follow the flight of the blacked-out object. Coincidently, shortly after this sighting, my wife saw a rather bright streaking light, likely a meteor, moving low in the sky past the house. For what it is worth, I am an engineer and ex air-traffic controller.;41.4250690265486;-87.3567999999999
Series of 3-5 lights seen multiple times in various formations, never making a sound or changing light intensity regardless of angle.;2017-10-04 21:00:00;20-30 minutes;Series of 3-5 lights seen multiple times in various formations, never making a sound or changing light intensity regardless of angle. UNEXPLAINED BRIGHT LIGHTS FLYING SLOWLY IN THE SKY OVER CROWN POINT, INDIANA.  FIRST NOTICED DUE TO OUR DOG GROWLING AT THEM.  THEY WOULD SLOWLY APPROACH FROM WHAT LOOKED LIKE A FEW MILES WEST OF MY LOCATION NEAR CROWN POINT HIGH SCHOOL, RISE INTO THE CLOUDS ROUGHLY OVERHEAD, THEN REAPPEAR FROM THE SAME DIRECTION A MINUTE OR TWO LATER, REPEATING THE SAME PATTERN.  EACH APPEARANCE WOULD LAST PERHAPS 5 MINUTES OR SO.  BETWEEN 3-5 WERE SEEN AT A TIME.  THEY WERE COMPLETELY SILENT, NEVER BLINKING OR CHANGING INTENSITY REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY WERE, AND IN DIFFERENT GROUPINGS EACH TIME (CLOSE TOGETHER, SPREAD OUT,  RANDOM, STRAIGHT LINE, DIAMOND, CURVED LINE, AND TRIANGLE).   AFTER APPROX. 30 MINUTES AND 5-6 APPEARANCES, THEY ROSE INTO THE CLOUDS ONE BY ONE AND WERE NOT SEEN AGAIN.;41.4250690265486;-87.3567999999999
