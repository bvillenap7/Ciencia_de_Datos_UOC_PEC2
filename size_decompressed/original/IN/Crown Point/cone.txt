I had just turned in to my subdivision when straight ahead and up in the sky I saw a cone shaped object with bright lights (I think they were white and yellow and orange) all around it.  It went up into the clouds at about a 45 degree angle, so fast, so VERY fast.  I never saw anything move that fast in my life!;41.4250690265486;-87.3567999999999
