unidentified flying object;2003-12-31 22:50:00;all night;unidentified flying object My fiancee was looking through the telescope trying to see Saturn when he came running in the house telling me to come and look at something he found. This thing was round like a small orb but it was all different colors like reds and greens and yellows. and the middle of this circular thing was swirling around and changing colors like some kind of prism thing. I dont know what it is but i would like to know if anyone else has spotted something like it. It didnt move around in circles or zig zag in the sky like people say but it did move and I know it wasnt a star it was way to low. Whatever it was it was weird. could you possibly give me some info on what this thing could have been;41.4250690265486;-87.3567999999999
