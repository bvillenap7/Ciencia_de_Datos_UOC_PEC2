red, green, and yellow flashing lights that don't move and keep flashing in sw  over Crown Point.  ((NUFORC Note:  (sic) Jupiter. PD));2007-09-28 20:10:00;still occuring;red, green, and yellow flashing lights that don't move and keep flashing in southwest sky over Crown Point I was looking at Venus in the southwest sky at 8:10 this evening and noticed just below it a bit between Venus and the Treetops in the far distance flashing lights like a star or something. I got my binoculars and looked closely and it is stationary, bright flashing red, green and yellow lights flickering and not moving.  I showed my son and my husband and they both see the same exact thing.  Planes go past it with their noticable lights flashing and this UFO just stays right in the same place not changing and continues to flash these colors as I write this message!  Very strange!  Its not moving up, down, right or left and is just below and to the right of the bright planet Venus. ((NUFORC Note:  It is Jupiter in the southwest sky, at present.
