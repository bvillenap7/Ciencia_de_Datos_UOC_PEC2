The CNN Film footage of the Shuttle Before the Break up.;2003-02-01 09:25:00;3 seconds;The CNN Film footage of the Shuttle Before the Break up. On 2/1/03 at 9am CST I was watching CNN and they were showing Mission Control when they first lost contact with the Shuttle.Around 9:25-9:35 am CST the first film footage was being shown and It definitely showed a object behind the Shuttle before it the Shuttle started to break apart. Within the hour that segment of that particular film footage was not being shown anymore.I have no idea what it was,but it was there and to this date I have not heard anyone talking about it  till I read it here on your site.Also I do have it on VHS.Thank you;41.4250690265486;-87.3567999999999
