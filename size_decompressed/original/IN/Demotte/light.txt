The light was eye-shaped traveling in front of a treeline almost at the tops of the trees, which I would say were 30 to 50 feet tall.   We were traveling in a car when we saw it out the windows.  My father was driving and my mother and I asked him to stop but he only slowed down and then the light was out of sight in about 10 seconds.  I could describe the intensity and color of the light as looking like those high intensity headlights with the bluish tint that we have all been blinded by while driving.   This was no car though because it was up in the trees clearly visible moving fast along the tree tops in a straight line and there is not a road in that direction.   The object emitted no sound.;41.1713;-87.2491
