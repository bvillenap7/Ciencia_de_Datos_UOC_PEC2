As I watched this ball of light slowly move, another yellow orange light appeared on its right side, my left.  This light slowly went towards the red ball, and it almost exploded into a wide smiley face mouth with looking to be lights on it.   When the other light went towards this light it looked like it left a trail of red. It glowed orange yellow and red now with looking to be lights.   I stopped at a near by friends at this point and three other witnesses there also seen the smiley face mouth in the sky on 1100 N.  All four of us watched it for approximately 10 minutes in the West, slightly North sky an object.  It appeared in a different area from what I could tell at that point.  Not sure.  It appeared then disappeared.  Until it descended completely still glowing orange yellow and red, bellow the tree lines with no visible lights on it then.  Maybe landing.;41.1713;-87.2491
