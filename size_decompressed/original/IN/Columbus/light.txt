Steady, non-flashing, rotating red light moves off to west.;2003-10-18 21:00:00;4-5 minutes;Steady, non-flashing, rotating red light moves off to west. Iam a 52 year old college graduate and part time UFO researcher. Last night while driving home from work, I noticed a red (about the color of a stop light only a little darker) spherical, steady light about 40Â° above the horizon to my left. At first I though it was a tower light but then realzed it was too high. It appeared to be stationary but I wasn't certain because I was moving at about 50 mph. Anyway, As I kept glancing at it, I noticed that an elongated, vertical, dark spot kept moving from right to left across the object/light which seemed to indicate that it was rotating. I looked for a road to turn off on but it took a few minutes and by the time I saw the light again, it had moved westward and was closer to the western horizon. Soon thereafter it moved out of sight. NOTES: I am an experienced observer of the night sky and of various types of aircraft and their light displays. This object, whatever it was, had a shade of red that I have never seen on an aircraft. Plus it appeared to be rotating and I saw no white or green flashing anti-collision lights. The sky was clear and the object was about three times as large as Mars appears to be. Mars, by the way was in a different part of the sky. I was driving on S.R. #7 in Indiana at the time and the object was just east of Columbus, Indiana in the northern sky. This was DEFINITELY not a twinkling star or a flare.Ive seen both of those many times.;39.2127039603961;-85.9196960396038
