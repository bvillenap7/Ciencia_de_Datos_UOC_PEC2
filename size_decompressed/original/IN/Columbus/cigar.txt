After stepping out of Fairoaks Mall in Columbus, IN around 7:00 p.m. I noticed what I first thought was a BLIMP, only MILES higher than any blimp I've ever seen before. I began to watch it as it traveled across the sky very slowly.  It was low for a jet or commercial plane, but still much higher than any blimp you would normally see.  I began to think maybe it was a weather balloon of some type, but eventually decided that since it was traveling on such a direct path that it must be some sort of vehicle with an engine.  I was first surprised by the fact of a blimp so high in the air at first, but what really surprised me was what happened after it had traveled halfway across the sky.  It was traveling at the same speed, never stopped or slowed or sped up, yet when it had traveled roughly halfway across the horizon it spat out a huge chunk of white smoke.  Then about 3-5 seconds later it spit out another hunk of what I thought was smoke.  Now there were 2 dashes ! of smoke across the sky coming from what I thought was a blimp.  My second witness also witnessed these puffs of smoke.  However, seconds after these two puffs were spat out, it began to emit a CONSTANT trail of this smoke like substance, just like your typical Chemtrail (or Contrail, I suppose).  After traveling at the same speed completely across the horizon, this Blimp (which looked like a cigar covered in Aluminum foil) just SUDDENLY, out of nowhere without changing a thing in trajectory, speed, or altitude, began to omit a chemtrail. It literally looked like a giant crop-dusting blimp, miles in the air.  The thought of it made us feel extremely eerie and upset for the remainder of the day.;39.2127039603961;-85.9196960396038
