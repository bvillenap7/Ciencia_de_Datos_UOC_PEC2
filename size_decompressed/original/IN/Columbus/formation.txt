5-6 rapidly blinking lights seen travelling in a straight line.;2006-04-17 17:45:00;few minutes;5-6 rapidly blinking lights seen travelling in a straight line. In the distance traveling across the northern sky, a series of five-six lights were blinking a in a rapid pattern.  These lights were very small, and there wer no other shapes visible.  They were travelling in a straight line, and the lights were flashing 5-6 times in a second, then they would have two seconds off or so, and then blink again.  The five lights wer not timed together.  They somewhat changed colors--mostly white, but every third or fourth blink it would be red or blue. They travelled out of sight in ENE direction.  There were no sounds, and it is a very clear night.  I would think they were quite a distance away.  I would guess that they were helicopters, but I have never seen lights behave thay way before.  The blinks of light were different time lengths--not all five blinks were on the same amount of time.;39.2127039603961;-85.9196960396038
