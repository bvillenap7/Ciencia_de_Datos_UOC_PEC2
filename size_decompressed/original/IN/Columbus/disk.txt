Pinkish white to red white disks;2010-07-16 22:00:00;20 SECONDS;Pinkish white to red white disks Driving North on County Rd. 400 3 miles south of Highway 58 near Walesboro. I noticed activity N W of my location, like a star moving in the clouds.  When I was 3 miles from Hwy 58 I seen a super bright disk shape object, it was like a pinkish white to red like white.  Then the second disk of the same detail.  The first disk come out of nowhere where I happened to be looking, then the second disk a couple of seconds later.  They were around 6000 to 8000 feet up moving fast, then they both shot away moving up very fast out of sight. It was very awesome.;39.2127039603961;-85.9196960396038
