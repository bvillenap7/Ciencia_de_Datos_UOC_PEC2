Orange flash of light.;2019-09-19 00:00:00;Seconds;My cat woke me up meowing, I comforted her and she settled into my side. There was an orange flash of light from outside that lit up the window, the light was outside.  I grabbed my IPad to see what time it was, it was 12:39 am. I got out of bed to look outside, I saw nothing, it's a clear night.  My husband woke up from the noise of me uplifting one of the slats of the blinds to see if anything was happening outside. My husband got out of bed to look out the windows, he thought it might be someone with a flash lite.  I don't think it was a flash lite because it was too bright, filled the window and lasted only a few seconds from the SW direction. What was strange is I didn't notice the sound of the crickets/cicadas, it was quiet,  I can hear them now. The grandfather clock rang, it was 1:00 am.;41.7454;-86.1387000000001
