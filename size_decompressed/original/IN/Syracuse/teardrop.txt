Orangey-pink orb that appeared to have a bright flame burning inside traveled over a lake SW to NE in a straight line.;2010-07-10 21:00:00;+/-15 minutes;Orangey-pink orb that appeared to have a bright flame burning inside traveled over a lake SW to NE in a straight line. We are out in the yard at the shore of a lake.  When we looked up there was a round, orangey-pink orb that looked as if there was a bright flame at the bottom of the orb.   The orb moved from southwest and traveled northeast across the lake in what looked at a deliberate, straight line leaving no tail.   It seemed to be at the height that a small aircraft would travel.  There was no sound.   As it got half-way across the lake, it entered the clouds and was gone.     About 15 minutes later, it happened again, identical in appearance, height, direction, speed, etc.     We didn't see it the rest of the evening.;41.4065;-85.7184
