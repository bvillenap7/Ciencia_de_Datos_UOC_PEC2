huge red glowing round objects traveling horizonally at a high rate of speed with no sound;2009-08-15 23:00:00;few minutes;huge red glowing round objects traveling horizonally at a high rate of speed with no sound Sitting on the back of our boat at Main Channel Marina in Syracuse Indiana on 8/15/2009 at about 10:45 to 11:00 p.m. my husband, my granddaughter and myself along with 2 men on other boats witnessed a huge round red glowing object come up over the tree line traveling  horizonally  over us and as it traveled away from us the object totally went black and disappeared.   There was no sound and it was traveling at a high rate of speed.  It was so glowing it almost looked like it was on fire.    We were discussing that it was the most bizarre thing we had ever witnessed when 2 more objects exactly like the first one came over the tree line and traveled the same path as the first one.   As they went over and traveled away from us they totally disappeared at the same spot as the first one.   Wonder if anyone else saw the same thing;41.4065;-85.7184
