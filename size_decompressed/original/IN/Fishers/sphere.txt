I was heading to subdivision at the Southeast corner of 116th and Brookschool in Fishers, IN about 8:45pm.  Witnessed a blueish green sphere with a trail moving at an extremely high rate of speed faster than an airplane or light. This lasted for 4-5 seconds. The sky was clear and this was not a spotlight, helicopter,plane or anything...it was moving too fast.  Did anyone else see this?  Please post!!;39.9576857142857;-85.9898666666667
