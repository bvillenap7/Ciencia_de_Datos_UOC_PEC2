The craft was southwest of my location.  The craft appeared to be triangular.  It had three bright white lights that were aligned parallel and nearly touching at the the top of the craft.  The craft also had two blue lights one at each two lower corners.   The craft looked as if it was perpendicular and pointing up towards the sky.  The craft appeared to be totally motionless. What drew my attention to the craft is it looked as if there was a spotlight shining on it.  It had a circular glow around it.  As I was watching the craft just disappeared.  No movement or anything it just vanished right in front of me.;39.9576857142857;-85.9898666666667
