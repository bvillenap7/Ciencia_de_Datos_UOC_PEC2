This was an extremely fast moving, thumbnail size light, emitting no sound.;2010-11-15 18:45:00;2 - 3 seconds;This was an extremely fast moving, thumbnail size light, emitting no sound. First spotted a fast moving, solid (not blinking) light about 60 degrees above east horizon, and about 60 degrees above north horizon, traveling due east to due west at an extremely high rate of speed. Several days ago I saw a shooting star, and thought this was another one.  The light continued due west at a very high rate of speed, disappearing behind trees on the west horizon. estimated time of sighting - 2 to 3 seconds max. There was no sound heard during this event. We are on landing pattern for Indianapolis Airport, with traffic headed southwest over our house. We also have heavy air traffic at cruising altitude, heading in various directions. Shortly after this sighting, I timed a commercial flight at cruising altitude, on approximately the same sight lines, which took about 120 seconds. There were no flights landing at this time. The size of the light was about thumbnail size.  If I had to guess the altitude, it would probably be under 15,000 feet. any higher and this light would have to be huge!  This light crossed the sky faster than anything I have ever seen.;39.9576857142857;-85.9898666666667
Bright 'orb'-type light seen in sky before seeing it quickly fall and disappear - Fishers, Indiana;2011-04-07 05:03:00;seconds;Bright 'orb'-type light seen in sky before seeing it quickly fall and disappear - Fishers, Indiana I awoke earlier than usual this morning, April 7, 2011, around 5:02 or 5:03 a.m. - went into kitchen - upon returning to Living Room where my windows are just about floor to ceiling - with a ‘half moon’ type top window over the bottom long window - I just happened to look up and out the ‘half moon’ window (which has no blind or covering) and which is about 8 feet or 9 feet high on the wall - and just then I spotted a very bright ‘orb’ type thing out the window - maybe a second or two later as I was rushing to the window to look out the blinds which are below the ‘half moon’ window  - keeping my eye on the bright ‘orb’ in the sky - it started to FALL quickly in the sky.   By the time I reached the window which was about 9 feet from where I had been standing - the bright light ‘orb’ was completely gone - just vanished  I kept looking out the window to see if there would be any more movement or re-appearance, but there was nothing else.  It was very bright and! large compared to the stars that were near it.  It was eerie the way it just fell straight down from the sky. Because of the fact that the bottom part of my window had blinds - I was only able to watch the orb until it started to plummet - then the bottom part of that window, because it had blinds over it, blocked me from viewing it any further.  By the time I reached it and opened the blinds it was nowhere in sight.  This was my first ever sighting.  I am 61 years of age.;39.9576857142857;-85.9898666666667
Two bright lights appear out of no where and make very odd movements in the sky directly above us.;2011-09-11 00:25:00;5 minutes;Two bright lights appear out of no where and make very odd movements in the sky directly above us. At 12:25a.m. on September 11th, 2011 a group of six adults (myself included) were sitting on the back deck of a house in Grey Eagle subdivision in Fishers, Indiana.  I had been looking at the sky noticing the broken cloud cover on this moonless evening.   Suddenly, directly above us, two bright lights appeared in the clouds...sitting stationary directly overhead.  At first, I (we) thought that it was someone shining some very large spotlights into the sky.  However, I soon realized that this could not be possible because 1) the source and angle would mean that the lights would have to emminate from our current seated position 2) there was no light trail like you would normally see from a large industrial spotlight used to promote a business 3) the more I looked the more it was apparent that the light source was coming from above the clouds and shining through them, not up to them.  Suddenly the two lights, which appeared to be about50 yards apart, began to move erratically.  They zigged and zagged, moved in circular and linear motions, and then one of the lights disappeared, only to reappear off in the distance, but remained about the same size.  That light then disappeared and reappered back over the top of us.  There was no sound associated with these lights, no smell, no disruption to anything on the ground.  This event lasted for about five minutes.  Then, just as quickly as they appeared, they disappeared.;39.9576857142857;-85.9898666666667
Oval foggy orbs  2-4, going around in circle above houses, following me down the street.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising. lights?  PD));2012-10-23 08:30:00;45 minutes;Oval foggy Orbs  2-4, going around in a circle above houses, following me down the street, in Fishers, IN Last night, Oct. 23, 2012, my son and I walked out of the house to walk our dogs.  My son took one of the dog’s around the block and I took the older dog the other direction down the street.  We always meet up at the end of the street. So as I was walking down the driveway I noticed above my neighbors’ house across the street 4 roundish lights going around in a large circle.  The circle was about the size of the house.  They were not real bright, almost resembled a foggy, cloudy light, but they were very noticeable.  At first I thought someone had some strobe light, which I dismissed, because it was not how a strobe light would look. I will explain that in a minute.  So I’m standing out in front of my house and a neighbor walks by with her dog.  I asked her if she saw the same thing I was seeing and she said “yes.”  I then asked her what she thought the lights were from and she thought perhaps one of those big lights from a store.  Then as we both looked at the lights weaving in and out as though they were chasing each other, we decided that couldn’t be, since that would be obvious if it were one of those big lights.  Let me make this clear.  I’m 51, I’ve seen the store lights in the sky, I’ve seen strobe ! lights too.  These circling lights were something I have never seen. They would go higher in the sky and then get lower.  At one point they were high enough to cross the path of a small plane going by.  It’s hard to estimate the distance of objects in the sky, so they may have been some distance from the airplane. Here’s the weirdest part.  As I continued to walk my dog the lights followed me.  When I reached the last house, there were only 2 orb type circles.  Still they were going around like they were chasing each other.  My son, was walking from the field, and the first thing he said was “Aliens.”  And I’m like, “ are you seeing them too?”  He tells me that he would not have noticed, but our dog stopped and looked at the lights, which made him freak, because she always runs the whole walk. My son, took off towards our house, leaving me with the lights and my slow dog.  I crossed the street and headed back home, aan of course the lights followed me.  I stopped several times just to study them.  When I reached my house, they were right above.  I took my dog into the house and grabbed my phone to videotape them.  As I taped them they were now high above in the middle of the street, and kept getting higher.  I’m not sure if I was able to capture them on my camera, but I haven’t checked. They finally disappeared   I have decided, without a doubt, they were either Spirits in the form of Orbs, or UFO’s of some sort.   I’m always going to believe something is manmade way before I conclude it is from a different source. But with this sighting, I see no other option, but to believe what I witnessed was from a supernatural origin, and they were studying me.  I also feel something big is about to take place.;39.9576857142857;-85.9898666666667
Group of strange light orbs over eastern Fishers, IN, for hours with no particular pattern.;2016-11-19 18:00:00;02:00 and continuing;Group of strange light orbs over eastern Fishers, IN, for hours with no particular pattern. A set of light orbs seen in the sky over eastern Fishers, IN, for more than 2 hours (it is still occurring as this is typed).  Many people within the neighborhood are standing outside watching.  Some report that this same thing happened in 2011.  At first they were expected to be spotlights as you can occasionally see a slight trail as they pass through clouds.  However, they seem to have no continuous pattern or looping effect that is used on a spotlight.  The light intensity varied as did the number of orbs. Maybe a meteorological phenomenon, maybe spotlights, but definitely strange.;39.9576857142857;-85.9898666666667

In SE at 133 degrees drop straight down and then it stopped then light went out I had a sighting with night vision goggles . I saw a light in the southeast at 133 degrees drop straight down and then it stopped and then the lights went out.  If I had to measure from arm length based on thumbnail I’d say it was half size of thumbnail and about a 45 degree angle in the sky from my position.;39.9576857142857;-85.9898666666667
