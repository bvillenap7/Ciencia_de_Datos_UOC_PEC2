pulsating light in the Indianapolis, IN area;2008-03-30 04:35:00;2-3 seconds;pulsating light in the Indianapolis, IN area At  4:35am, March 30, 2008, I witnessed while travelling south bound on Highway 37/Interstate 69 just north of 96th Street (approx. ¼ mile) in the Indianapolis/Fishers (IN) area an unusual light pattern.  The light was a low intensity, translucent, white to very light blue in color, and oblong in shape. The size was similar to that of a beach ball, maybe a little bigger. The light rapidly moved north at my guess of 100+mph perpendicular to the outside shoulder of the northbound lanes its altitude was approximately 30’ above the ground. I saw no object related to the light, but the light seemed to pulse/flash at every length of its width in travel, a very rapid pulse considering the speed that I surmised. I tried to keep view of the object, but travelling at 60mph myself and crossing a lane inadvertently to view it (then trying to regain my control of my vehicle) I lost sight of the light.;39.9576857142857;-85.9898666666667
Weird oval shaped UFO.;2013-07-18 20:00:00;30 minutes;Weird oval shaped UFO We witnessed this thing my girlfriend thought to be a huge bird. I thought it looked more like someone had let a balloon go.  Because it was floating in an unusual pattern.   It then tilted.  And showed a single red flashing light on top of what looked to be an oval shape object. It floated slowly.  From west to east.   And then got to a point in the southeastern sky and floated straight up.;39.9576857142857;-85.9898666666667
Chrome Oval shaped craft over Fishers, Indiana 6/30/19;2019-06-30 15:48:00;30-45 seconds;Chrome Oval shaped craft over Fishers, Indiana 6/30/19 I was driving slowly North on Atlantic Road just South of 126th street on 6/30/19 at 3:48PM. While looking to my left at the soybean crop, I had a bright flash in my eyes that drew my attention to the North. I looked up at a 45 degree angle and there was a chrome/ mirrored oval / LP Gas tank (like you see on farms) type of craft approximately 6500-7500 feet in altitude. It was moving slowly from East to West and then stopped and hovered for a few seconds as I pulled to side of road. As I lifted my I-phone to take a picture, the craft dropped behind the cloud. I took a few pictures and one of them came back with why appears to be the nose/tip of the craft stick out of the cloud. There was no exhaust, noise or light other than the sun reflecting off of the chrome body of the craft. I stayed and continued to look up for 15 - 20 minutes but never saw the craft again. The height of the craft was based on average altitude of cumulus clouds. I would estimate the cr! aft to be approximately 45-55 feet long and around 10-12 feet high. I had the presence of mind to ask Siri flights overhead after the craft didn’t reappear and there were a few flights over head between 30-38,000 feet which is much higher than what I was witnessing.;39.9576857142857;-85.9898666666667
