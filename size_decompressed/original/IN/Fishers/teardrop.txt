Teardrop shaped orb of light at non human speed then vanished.;2020-05-06 10:38:00;6 seconds;Teardrop shaped orb of light at non human speed then vanished. Date: 05/06/2020 Time: 10:38 pm EST  Where:  Looking North-North East from XXXX Galley Way Fishers, IN 46040   I Looked out of the open garage window and saw a blueish white glowing object flying East.  I wouldn't say it had lights, rather the whole object was glowing. I immediately noticed it was moving at a strange speed, not faster than a plane just an odd pace, not normal.  It was shaped like a tear drop with tail pointing west.  The object made no noise and had a hazy appearance.  It sped off quickly the same direction it was moving.  When we walked outside the overhead garage door to try and see it again I expected it to be overcast because of how the object looked and the focus of light coming from it.  It was a very clear night though.  Venus was very bright and the dull moon was behind our house. The object was gone.  I was in the military a long time, deployed overseas, etc., I currently still work for the DoD.  I have never seen anything like this before, I have never seen a plane moving at this strange speed, and I do not take this lightly.;39.9576857142857;-85.9898666666667
