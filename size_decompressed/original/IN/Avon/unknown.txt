We live in a suburban type neighborhood, and I had just put my kids down to bed.  So I went outside to smoke.  All of the sudden I saw three crafts in the sky flying together, with bright pulsating orange lights that seem to be flying in a zig zag pattern coming over some trees in the neiborhood and closer. When they got closer I realized that they were not airplaines and they were spinning thats why they seemed to be flying in a zig zag pattern, and then two more started coming over the tree line and I ran to get my boyfriend, and I was screaming OH MY GOD YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS!!!  He came out and was shocked thats when we were noticed that also they seemed to flying straight up at the same point in the sky and vanishing, instead of going straight out through the horizon.  Thats when my boyfriend decided to go grab his cell phone and try and get pictures if there was more, and boy was there,  They just kept coming.  I was counting them, and had some! point I reminded him that there was a video recorder on the phone.  On the photographs it just look liked orange sphere shaped specs, but to us we could see them clear as day.  On the video the craft seemed to be dancing around the sky and then vanishes.  At one point one of them was going a little slower than the other and it had like a diamond shape of lights under it.  The orange lights were so bright they kind of looked like flames. Later some regular planes came buy. I wondered if they had seen it too. I never believed in UFO's before untill last night. The experiance was life changing.;39.7667999999998;-86.4013000000006
Green and Red Ribbon Lights Passing Over My Neighborhood.;2020-09-26 20:35:00;4 minutes;Green and Red Ribbon Lights Passing Over My Neighborhood. We were driving when my wife first observed lights in the sky.  She slowed the car and leaned forward looking up through the windshield.  She announced what she was seeing and I looked up through the windshield and also observed two lights as they were passing over us.  The lights were red and green but and emanated from the same place, not like two separate lights which would be installed on an air planeâ€™s wing tips.  These lights gave me an impression that there were on the underside of the craft and were more like a light ribbon instead of distinct bulbs.  The lights passed over us and they were seemed to vary their distance from each other in an almost playful flight pattern.  It was difficult to estimate the size of the crafts against the night sky.  My best estimate is less than 100 feet at the time of observation.  We did not notice any air craft engine noises.  I used my cell phone and caught a short video clip of the objects in the North sky as they continued out of our view.  The whole incident lasted 2-3 minutes.;39.7667999999998;-86.4013000000006
