(Pacific) on Sunday, July 4th, 2004, NUFORC received a telephoned message from an adult male, located in Madison, IN, reporting that three orange lights had been seen, and video-taped, near the Madison Regatta on Saturday night, July 3rd.  The witness reported that he had been at the motor home parking facility at that regatta, when he, and a number of other witnesses, allegedly had witnessed three orange balls of light move across the sky, and one of them apparently had separated itself from the other two, and landed on a nearby hilltop.  When asked if he had gone to the hilltop to inspect that site of the alleged landing, he said he had not.  The witness identified himself as a local public employee (law enforcement), and stated that he did not want to get involved in the case.  NUFORC would welcome detailed reports from any other witnesses to the alleged aerial event.;38.7613;-85.4066000000001
Strange red and green lights shaped and hovering.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star?  PD));2014-07-05 21:45:00;35 minutes;Strange red and green lights shaped and hovering. strange red and green light flashing in sky, hovering for about 35 minutes sometimes moving forward and backward, up and down, and hovering. the green light was a circle the red light was a rectangle it looked like an L shape craft/lights.  The flashing was a long green flash then a quick red flash, it was repeating. before it flew away directly east the red light started to flash wildly or it seemed that way to me.  As it was leaving the red light became 3 small red lights. It looked like 2 rectangles, one on the left and one on the right with 1 small red square in the middle.  The shapes of the lights was very crisp and clear without distortion or halos.  For the clarity of the lights I think they where very very large but almost dim to be so clear.

One light moving across the sky. Then another one started behind it a ways. Then a third ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-23 21:00:00;5 minutes;One light moving across the sky. Then another one started behind it a ways. Then a third spaced exactly the same distance started behind it. They kept traveling across the sky as the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and then 8th started all spaced evenly. The 8th one disappeared and shortly there after they all disappeared. Too far up to record. We tried.;38.7613;-85.4066000000001
Ultra bright white light with acceleration twice that of a stealth bomber, yet with an effortless smooth glide moving through the night;2020-05-11 01:30:00;5-10 seconds;Ultra bright white light with acceleration twice that of a stealth bomber, yet with an effortless smooth glide moving through the night 1:30 am Madison,IN  I witnessed an ultra bright light.  The whitest light I’ve ever seen, traveling toward the northwest sky.  I got a very good 5 second look at it, but a tree interfered with my view as it moved northwest toward Indianapolis.  Its acceleration was an effortless smooth glide.  No sound.  Impossible to judge, I would describe its altitude well below commercial air traffic.  Its acceleration as twice the speed of a stealth bomber.  Fast but not shooting star fast. I’m on the Ohio River between Louisville and Cincinnati.  And I would speculate this object would have reached Indianapolis in 5 seconds, then Chicago 5 seconds later.  This too is only speculation, but it did seem to be in the form of a disc.  Interestingly, 10 seconds or so after the object disappeared, I witnessed a bright flash of light to the right (East) of where the object was headed. The flash was in the form of a circle. It was unusual in that as an every night sky watcher I’ve never seen anything of comparison.  I submit this report as my due diligence to the UFO community. I have researched this subject extensively through the in-depth study of thousands of case files. I am beyond knowledgeable in the history of the UFO phenomenon. But I have never seen anything that even remotely resembles a UFO in my 41 years of existence. I would like to continue my research and study of this phenomenon. Unfortunately, I don’t want to publicize this sighting by reporting it anywhere else, having my name attached to it. However, I did see it, and it was unlike anything I have ever seen before.
