It as sparkling somewhat like a sparkler except the colors were only yellow and white. I was turning east so when it passed my line of sight followed. The object appeared to be a little larger than a basket ball, althuogh I could not see the back portion. I noted that it appeared to pass through the tops of two maple tree in the neighbors yard and I stoped in front of them and could see a smoke or vapor trail into the trees at the end of the feild behind the yard. I'm an aviation nut and have spent some time watching planes landing and feel that I can estimate the speed to have been under 200mph. I beleive that the object would have come to ground in less than a mile. The elevation at the point I saw the object is 850 ft and there are some ridges beyond that point that are 850 ft +. I've been trying to get better cordinates in order to limit the search area and intend to look for it. Within 15 minuets helicopters searched the area.;38.7613;-85.4066000000001
