Last night was going to Subway I was driving down the road about one mile from my house. Something catches my attention and I see this silver or white circle thing it was over a grave yard. I stop the car and look out the window the silver circle shaped thing pulsed three or four times and it was gone. I when through the grave yard to see if anyone or thing was in there no one was.  It all lasted about 25 seconds. It was the weirdest thing I very saw.;40.8367;-85.3208
