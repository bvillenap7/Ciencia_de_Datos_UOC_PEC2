I saw them zipping around, there was 5 that were big enough to separate, couple small ones looked the same as the big one.  silver in color and round on top with kind of jellyfish bottoms.   IT was about 1/4 mile up and a 1/4 mile away.  I slowed down to 45 to take a pic with my phone 1.3MP .  as i took the picture they when straight up till i couldn't see.  it was a nice kinda cloudy day.;40.8367;-85.3208
