Four fireballs rising from the horizon into the clouds.;2013-06-29 23:15:00;5 minutes;Four fireballs rising from the horizon into the clouds My wife and I were parked at the distribution center for a company in Gas City, IN. We were waiting in a line of semi trucks to enter the garage area when we witnessed the first two objects rise from the horizon behind the building to our east. The objects in question appeared to come from the Upland, IN area and proceed to the south west. The objects were reddish orange in color and were rising into the sky. Both were moving parallel to each other at the same speed and distance.  They continued up into the clouds to our south and disappeared. The third object appeared from the same location as the first two, roughly one minute later.  This was the same color as the others and followed the same general path in the sky. The object rose into the sky and disappeared behind the clouds the same as the first two. The fourth object followed about forty five seconds later while we were watching the third object disappear, and did as described above. Same orange color with a slight flicker to it. The sky was overcast. The objects in question were approximately the size of a pencil eraser held out at arms length.  The time was approximately 23:15 to 23:30. No fireworks were occurring at this time. The objects looked like balls of fire. My wife and Myself witnessed this as well as another truck driver, his wife, a mechanic, and a man that works at the guard gate to the facility.  My wife was able to get a video of the first two objects moving parallel to one another, but the Iphone 5 video camera will not zoom.  She took still photos of the third object with the camera zoomed in.  The fourth object was not captured due to us talking to witnesses and leaving our phones in the cab of the truck.;40.4836;-85.6137
