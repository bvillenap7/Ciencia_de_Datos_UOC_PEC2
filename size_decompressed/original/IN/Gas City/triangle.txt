By time I made it to Gas City Park, the objects were closer, bigger and brighter and clearly not lanterns.  They were triangular with lights at 3points and several on bottom they were hovering, slowly toward the east.  Was in phone w friend who was coming from 69 far east and ask me ifiI seen them as well.  We discuss what we each see and next in main st gas city at circle k and observed, they were low silent and large.  Directly above us.  The 2 we saw were about 3 mins apart in flying over us.  One in distance as well headed same direction.   I posted on FB, and another friend, in Marion at the time, she comments she seen them from Marion but she and another saw 5 of them.   Storm was blowing in, and her friend assumed they were planes, she said she could see they weren't planes, but could tell they were toward gas city but couldn't see details.  Also appeared to be small plane following, also slow and way low. I attempted to get video of it I have four copies of that you can't make out.  I had got a new phone the day before so I don't know how to work the camera and these object seemed very very far away in the video and they were really really close in person.;40.4836;-85.6137
