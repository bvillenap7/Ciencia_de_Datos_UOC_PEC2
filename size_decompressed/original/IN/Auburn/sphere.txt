We saw them from our car, and they hovered over the building in a tight triangular formation.  We tried to explain it away as an airplane, but airplanes don't hover in midair.  Thus, this 3-lighted-orb triangular formation still defies explanation.  The sighting lasted about 2 minutes.  We saw the same lights a couple of hours later (when we were leaving the church after a concert) these things were still hovering over it! The object consisted of a tight triangular formation of 3 white orbs of light. The lights hovered in their formation over a church building as we were approaching it in our car. There were three of us in the car heading to that church for a Christmas concert (12/14/97). Two of the observers (sister and mother) are skeptics who do not believe in the existence of UFOs. I (the third) had seen a UFO many years earlier (July 1984 at camp) I have been open to the possibility of their existence, and can not explain these objects in any earthly sense.;41.3569;-85.0497
