((anonymous report));2019-01-05 23:00:00;3 seconds;As my brother and I were outside, we saw a bright circle fly quickly through the air, and I witnessed it do a loop before taking off. It was pretty late at night, but my dad, my brother, and I had to do some work outside a little ways from home.  My brother and I were outside while my dad was in a building for the time being.  We both were looking in about the same direction, but I had been looking towards the sky quite a bit that night.   As I was looking up in roughly a northeast direction, I saw a bright white circle appear.  As soon as I saw it, I alerted my brother and he immediately looked up as well.  Before he looked, I saw the object do a full loop, then quickly fly up and away into another direction in an arc.  The object was very fast and a decent size, yet it was very far away.  It made no noise that I could hear.  I asked my brother if he saw it and what he saw, and he said that it looked yellow and that he didnâ€™t see it loop, but saw it fly away in an arc.  That is all I could get from it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.8271;-85.445
