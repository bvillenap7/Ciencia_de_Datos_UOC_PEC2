Bright nocturnal lights;2006-10-04 02:00:00;at leat 1 hour;Bright nocturnal lights I woke up around midnight and saw my bedroom window illuminated like a car was pulling up the driveway and didn't think much about it. Happened about one hour later, now I thought it was lightning related a severe weather was predicted, checked local rader but no imminent weather was near.  Around 2AM the lights were back but much brighter, looked outside and noticed what lloked light multiple moving bright lights through the dense trees. They seem to be on top of a small hill or even the top of the trees. Gusty winds make the trees move and made it hard to have a clear shot at the event, they seem to brighten and dim and have little color (red) in them.  At first I thought it was  a forestfire with severe weather daily prior to this. I quickly dismissed this as a fire does not produce flashlight like beams to reach my window several hundred feet away. ext I though hunters setting up in the trees but this is all private propertie with no hunting activity in years.  I woke up my wife and went outside on the deck to take a better look but moving trees prevented this again.  The light disappeared about 15 minutes later and occurred again about 30 min later for no more than 2 minutes.;41.5983000000001;-86.7025999999999

No flashing lights and no colors.  5 minutes later, 4 more in rectangular formation heading same direction but one very small and traveling faster until reaching one of the others then traveling at same speed as others.  Kind of eratic flying not staying in perfectly straight line but moving fast and high with no trails or sound.;41.5983000000001;-86.7025999999999
