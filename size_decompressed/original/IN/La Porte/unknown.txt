Strobing light;2012-08-14 20:31:00;1:31;strobing light Going outside for a cigarette I imediately noticed an object west of my location which resembled a strobe light I instantly got my camera out and began making a video of it.   Eventhough there was fireworks in the area (where I don't know because I could only hear them) Almost as soon as I started making a video of it, something came out the bottom of the object.  The object resembled our fire emitting friend that I and others have seen many times over the last year.  Whatever came out the bottom very quickly faded away and the original object disappeared into the clouds.  No sounds or disruption of electricity happend and there was no aircraft near it.;41.5983000000001;-86.7025999999999
Red and White lights possible Plane.;2014-07-17 23:50:00;1 minute;Red and White lights possible plane. I was outside viewing the night sky when this set of Red and White flashing lights started cruising by.  I watched it for approximately 1 minute.  It was fairly close and low but there was no sound emitting from it.  I also noticed that there were no Green lights on it.  The Red lights were flashing slower than the white lights.  The White lights resembled strobe lights but no Green lights?   Because of the night, I could not see the craft itself.;41.5983000000001;-86.7025999999999
