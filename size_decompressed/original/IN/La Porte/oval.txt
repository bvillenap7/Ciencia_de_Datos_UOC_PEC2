Slow moving object with airplanes nearby.;2014-08-18 18:00:00;2 Minutes;Slow moving object with airplanes nearby. I was out bird watching for Cardinals and airplanes are a common occurrence including being nearby our local airport.  Since no Cardinals have been coming around for a while and taking pictures of them are challenging at best, I looked up to see what kind of airplane was passing by.  I noticed a plane going by and listening to the roar of its engine. I also noticed a very slow moving object that had to be 100 above treetop level.  I had a very good look at this object which appeared to be oval shaped, white on the bottom and mid-tone to dark gray on the top.  The object also appeared to tilt like a plane would as it turns but then the object tilted back to its original position. I immediately got my camera out which I always carry with me and took 2 pictures of this thing.  I then switched over to video and took 1:10 video of it.  At the end I tried zooming in and also tried getting on the other side of the tree to recapture the object but I was not fast enough.  I reviewed the video later and found out it is out of focus after zooming in.  The pictures I took are crisp and clear. In the video and pictures you can clearly see airplanes near the object but also not aware of it being near them.;41.5983000000001;-86.7025999999999
