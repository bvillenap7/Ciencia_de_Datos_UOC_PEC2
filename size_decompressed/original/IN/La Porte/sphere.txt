Taking random pictures of the sun.  ((NUFORC Note:  Either a hoax, or case of mistaken identity, we believe.  PD));2011-06-07 11:11:00;1 second;While sitting on the porch smoking a cigarette taking random pictures of the sun.  This picture 100_4286.jpg shows 2 objects next to the sun.   At the bottom of the sun and slightly to the right. ((NUFORC Note:  We see a tiny speck in the photo, about the size of a single pixel.  We have no reason to believe that the anomalous object is a UFO.  We have received many, many photos from the individual who submitted this report, but none appears to us to be a genuine UFO.

Fire emitting sphere seen for the 4th time while on porch having a cigarette;2011-06-21 11:12:00;90 seconds;Fire emitting sphere seen for the 4th time while on porch having a cigarette While having a cigarette on the porch this object came into view from the west at 10:14 p.m.   I could not see see the craft at this time but I have seen this object on 3 other occasions.  The craft is a sphere shape and emits fire at the bottom.  It traveled from the west to the east at approximately 5 miles per hour with the flame flickering.   I tried to capture pictures of it using my digital camera but could only get the flame of the object (picture 100_5372.jpg - 100_5375.jpg)    The object made no sound and was approximately 50 feet above treetop level.;41.5983000000001;-86.7025999999999
Bright light seen in sky;2012-11-14 05:45:00;00:02;Bright light seen in sky I went outside for a cigarette and noticed that there was a thin layer of clouds in the sky also noticing that the planet Venus was not visible but Jupiter was.  I then looked toward the North and almost directly above me and seen a very bright light shining through the clouds and moving very slowly to the East in a direct flight path.  While viewing this object it also seemed to elluminate a small portion of the cloud making an aura around it.  This told me that if it was not in the cloud it was very close to the top of the cloud close enough to make the object to appear larger.  The approximate time was 5:45 a.m. because I did not have my watch on or my phone with me and when I came back inside the time was 5:48 on my phone.  I had to have viewed this object for a little over 2 minutes until I could no longer see it.  This was not an airplane because the light remained visible from viewing the front as it came toward my location and remained bright as it p! assed my location then dimmed out from thickness of the cloud.  My phone is currently not active this month but available through email.;41.5983000000001;-86.7025999999999
