Orange fire balls seen turning in sky;2012-07-03 22:55:00;1:30;orange fire balls seen turning in sky Sitting outside having a cigarette I noticed a bright orange ball which seemed to be on fire emerge from treetop levell.   I then grabbed  my digital camera which started acting up to try and capture an image of this object.  I then went to the east side of the apartment to find my neighbor coming outside to tell me that this is his 2nd time seeing an object  very similar to this one 2 nights before.   After this object had emerged from the tree/road line, it quickly made a turn to the east and continued on an east, northeast path.   Its speed was quite rapid because in just under 2 minutes, it was out of visual sight.   When the object emerged from the tree line, the object had to be approximately 1 city block away from us.  My neighbor told me that when he seen this type of object before, there were 2 of them.   Both of the objects were orange with yellow bottoms to them and they were just over treetop level.  At no time did I hear any sound coming from the obj! ect eventhough there were fireworks present.;41.5983000000001;-86.7025999999999

Color changed suspended in Air Good Evening All,  Just around 21:17 pm four of my sons we outside in front of the house hanging out talking.  My oldest, 26, noticed a very bright light in the sky, and out of curiosity, he asked, “Whay is that?”... they other theee boys. 19, 13, and 8, looked up in the sky to see what he was referring to.  Then all of a sudden, the craft changed into a red glow.  Moved swiftly at a 90 degree angel.  Made a brief stop next to another shining light which we are guessing it was another craft, then shot straight up in the air.  My sons started running into the house, my 8 and 13 year olds were screaming”,  MOMMY THERE’S A UFO OUT THERE RIGHT NOW!!!! “ I ran down the stairs and out the door but it had already vanished into the sky.  There were times before we heard strange noises outside in the late nights, and I also seen a huge white owl atop my post one morning when I was watching my son wait for the school bus to come and I yelled out to him to look at he looked up and seen the owl and started runnin! g back up the driveway.  Then the owl kinda soared over to a rooftop across the road and he looked at us.  I was in such disbelief, I was frozen and scared, I felt like it was not even real.  I had not ever seen any bird that huge and he was Snow White with black eyes. At the same time, he truly was the most beautiful and the most elegant creature I had ever seen in my life.   Thank You all for your ability and efforts to educate and discover.  Have a wonderful night.;41.5983000000001;-86.7025999999999
