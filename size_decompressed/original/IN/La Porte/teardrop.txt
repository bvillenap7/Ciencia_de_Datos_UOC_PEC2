While standing on my back porch I witnessed an extremely bright object in the sky.  At first I believed it was the sun, but I was mistaken.  The object was orange-ish and appeared to be related to a fireball.  The object went straight up, moved to the right,  moved to the left,  then went straight south, and disappeared into the horizon.   Once the object hit the tree lines in the southern horiszon I was no longer able to see the object, that I believe is a UFO.
