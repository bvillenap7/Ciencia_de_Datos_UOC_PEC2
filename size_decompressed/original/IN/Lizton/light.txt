My Son, Husband and I watched a very bright light that flashed from white to blue.  It stayed in the same spot approximately 20 minutes and then ducked behind the trees.  It moved in and out of the trees for about 5 minutes and then just disappeared.  This was definitely not an airplane or a helicopter.;39.8814;-86.5421
