I plus 3 others were traveling north on state road 39, time was 18:50. I noticed a bright light out my drivers side window, it was very bright, I could see a small plane to the south of the light thing, but this was keeping pace with my car, a truck and one other car.  It looked like two frisbees one on top of the other, I reached for my cell phone to take a photo and when I looked up, the object thing was maybe half as bright, I started to open my camera app and it was gone. All three of us pulled over and got out of our cars and couldnâ€™t see it anymore.;39.8814;-86.5421
