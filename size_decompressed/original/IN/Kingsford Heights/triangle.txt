3 triangle shaped objects hovering overhead.;1995-03-25 22:00:00;1 minute;3 triangle shaped objects hovering overhead. I was in backyard, with telescope, I was not using scope when I saw the objects. I was looking in the sky when all of a sudden above me I saw a red triangle shaped object hovering above me, and spinning, it appeared to be at a very high altitude, then all at once  2 more more objects joined it. All three were hovering above my head,  I was startled but I could not look away. I was amazed I had never seen anything like this before, and I have never seen them since. They were just hovering and then all at once they spend away faster than I had ever seen anything fly. I then ran into the house and told my wife and she acted as if she didn't believe me, I know what I saw. They did not make any noise that I could hear, I saw no lghts on them, all three objects were solid red. That is al the info that I have.;41.4788;-86.6959
