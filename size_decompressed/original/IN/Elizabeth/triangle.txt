They appeared to be very low in the sky.  I went inside and got my spot light and asked my wife to come outside and look. When I went back outside I walked towards my neighbors to get a better look.  I could tell they were advancing from the west to the east very slowly and more in line than side by side.  The first aircraft came over, slow for an airplane and I could hear it sounded like an airplane but not real loud, I was able to illuminate it enough with my spot light to tell it was triangular in shape, it had a white light in the front or tip of the triangle and more red and white lights down the sides didn’t count them or notice the order.  I watched as the next one approached it seemed to be following in the same flight pattern as the first, the third was the same as the other two. 	I noticed two more lights in the distance approaching as the others did.  The flew over in the same pattern as the previous three. They may have been aircraft in a holding pattern for the airport in Louisville Ky., but they were very low, very slow and not very loud.  My wife saw the same thing I did and thought they were strange as well;38.1233;-85.9627999999999
