I was driving,  And I saw a dot in the sky, it was 5 o'clock, so I am sure it wasn't a phone tower's light.  Its shape was like a BB,  It was glowing orange, and about thirty seconds later, I had driven under a tree, and that blocked the view for a few seconds.  But after I passed the tree, it was gone... I didn't see any aircraft or anything else near it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.1031258064516;-85.678195967742
