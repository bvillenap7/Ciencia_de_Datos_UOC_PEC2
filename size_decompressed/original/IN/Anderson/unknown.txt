I am not one to assume anything strange upon first seeing something out of place. I generally assume there is a logical explanation for almost everything that can be observed with the naked eye.  Tonight however, I witnessed something unusual and inexplicable. I was fishing at a local pond facing northward when I saw 3 lights obviously at high altitude.  Living near airports growing up gives you a unique frame of reference.  They were either three objects moving at very high speed in formation, or a single massive object. I could see most of the stars and constellations over me, to the east and to the west, however, their were hazy clouds in the distance where I was facing and after 2-3 minutes it began to become obscured by those clouds. I have witnessed this many times and would have thought little of it except without a drastic change in the objects heading there was a major clearing not far to the east of where It disappeared.  I watched hoping to get another look thinking I might ascertain what it was, but it never reappeared. That is the point at which I reached the conclusion that this was not something normal, nor could it be explained by logic or common sense.  The lights were steady, with an equal distance between them however as far away as it was that distance appeared as if it could have easily covered a football field between the each light. There were no flashing lights, there were also no sounds which was also very strange.  I have witnessed hundreds of passenger jets fly overhead and their are distinct characteristics.  I saw both but the solid lights moving rapidly until the vanished and there was never a sound.;40.1031258064516;-85.678195967742
