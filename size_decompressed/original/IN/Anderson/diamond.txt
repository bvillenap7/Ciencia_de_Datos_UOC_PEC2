Indiana witness at Anderson recalled a UFO event from 2015 where the object was “as big as a football field” and just 300 feet overhead, according to testimony in Case 82148 from the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) witness reporting database.  The witness was walking home after a third shift in November 2015 when the incident occurred.  “No cars were out,” the witness stated. “Just me walking down the middle of a major road.”  The witness saw the UFO out of the corner of his eye. &#8203 “I turned to the right and saw the huge, stretched, diamond-shaped spaceship. It had orange lights on all sides of it. It was just floating in a straight line heading east. No noise, no fumes. It was massive. Floating 200 feet above me.”;40.1031258064516;-85.678195967742
