Three grayish-brown cylinder shaped objects with no sound or lights.;1998-11-01 10:00:00;5sec.;Three grayish-brown cylinder shaped objects with no sound or lights. We had just gotten out of my van, when my 5yr.old son pointed up to the sky and said LOOK AT THE AIRPLANE. There in the northen sky were three grayish brown cylinder shaped objects moving toward the south. Each one was  about the size of a grayhound bus. They were silent, no lights, and they appeared to be spinning clockwise while staying in a perfect V formation. I estimate they were only about 1000 feet up. When we came into the house, I had him draw what he had seen and I did the same. The drawlings were the same. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.
