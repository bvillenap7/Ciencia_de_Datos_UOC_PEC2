Nine glowing objects seen over my house in Anderson Indiana;2008-10-31 23:25:00;15 minutes;Nine glowing objects seen over my house in Anderson Indiana On Friday, October 31, 2008 late evening I was walking a friend to her car parked in my drive.  We talked for about fifteen minutes then she brought to my attention a glowing light up in the sky.  Her first comment was,  it looks like a helicopter.  I  said no it is moving to fast. Then I noticed there was no noise and suggested it to be a falling star.  As it went over my house we both thought it very unusual.It came out of the sky from the southwest and was traveling to the northeast.  We watched as it went out of sight.  Then she through her hands up and pointed to another one.  The first five came in a steady stream.  All at the same altittude, direction and speed.  At this time I went into the house and got my room-mate whom has been flying since he was fifteen and was a commercial pilot for over fifteen years.  Then another light appeared and soon after another.  Then a moment later a third.  The first two took a path a little off from the first five and the third cut to the north.  My room-mate commented they were a diamond shape.  Then with a pause the final glow went through on the same path as the first five.;40.1031258064516;-85.678195967742
