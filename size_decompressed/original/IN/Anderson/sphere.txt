A very bright white dot.;2016-07-15 22:15:00;5 minutes;A very bright white dot While outside, I observed a very high flying craft above an aircraft which was in the area and well above the broken clouds.  At 1st it was head NE from the SW.  When I first observed it I assumed it was a satellite or the space station which I have watch in the past, until it made a hard left right turn, followed by a very fast u turn to the left.   I can honestly say I've never seen anything move so quick and make turns like it was doing in my life!   It ended up traveling west at a very very fast speed.;40.1031258064516;-85.678195967742
