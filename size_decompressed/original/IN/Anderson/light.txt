lights in a line over my sisters house;2007-07-15 23:00:00;ufo over house;lights in a line over my sisters house One night in July in 2007 My 3 sister and I was standing out side of my sisters house, when my yongest sister asked why is that air plain pulling the other plain? I looked up to see what she was talking about  when I seen two lights moving east to west in the sky. I told my other sister to look up. for about 10 mins we seen the lights moving  one behind the other when the frist light drop down and the other one did the same. It was still moving in a stright line but now it was moveing down. for about 3 min when watch it and just as fast as my sister seen it the light when out. To this day we still dont know what we seen that night. It couldnt of been any thing to do with clouds because it was a clear night not a cloud in the sky. If any one see the same thing put it on line so I know what it could be ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Dont kno what it is but in the SW sky tward indy there is what looks like a star that changes color. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius.  PD));2010-03-17 22:00:00;4 hr;Dont kno what it is but in the south west sky tward indy there is what looks like a star that changes color.  It is very bright and for sure changes color.  You can see red white green purple with the naked eye and a spotting scope. You can see it when it is dark and it lasts most the night. Not sure what it is and it does not seem like a normal star.

8 red lights approached from the S heading NW;2012-06-10 21:00:00;4 minutes;8 red lights approached from the S heading NW 8 red lights brighter than plane lights, hovered high above our house for about 3 minutes.  Then 5 disappeared where they were floating, and three suddenly shot off so far into the distance that they were almost on the horizon, 10 seconds after the 5 disappeared.  About 5 seconds after the move, one of them faded with a duration of about 3 seconds.  Then the remaining two joined together into one light and faded with a duration of approximately 15 seconds.;40.1031258064516;-85.678195967742
I seen several objects of light flying through the sky and maneuvering ways we can’t yet.  ((anonymous report));2019-08-08 00:30:00;30 minutes;I was outside around 0:30 when I seen several objects of light flying through the sky and maneuvering ways we can’t yet. August 9, 2016   Let me start by saying that I have always believed that we are not alone in this universe.  In the past year I have become more and more interested in finding out the truth and why the government is trying to keep it secret!  I had been watching a tv program called “Ancient Aliens: Declassified and “Project Blue Book”when I decided that I would watch the sky at night periodically.  I truly wasn’t optimistic about this because I figured my state would obviously have very few sightings if any at all. Two months ago, I was at my sisters house and we were outside on the porch.  I just happened to be looking at the sky between the trees when I saw bright light (I just thought was a star) and just watched for a minute or less because the light was moving then quickly shot across the sky like a flash of light.  I asked my sister if she seen it and she said no and laughed at me.  Since then I haven’t discussed what I see with anyone unless they are at least open to the fact that what I’m saying is true!   I’ve seen few more since then but hadn’t been very consistent with watching the sky.  Last night I decided to go outside with my granddaughter and look at the stars.  It was a clear night and a great night to find/see a falling star!  My granddaughter went in the open garage to play for a little while and I continued to watch the sky when I noticed that to the left of me, when I began to notice many (more than I’ve ever seen fly in at the same time)  airplanes flying towards our airport. I couldn’t to keep watching because it seemed peculiar and I wondered why.  While I was watching the sky I noticed 2 lights in the sky that almost looked like stars but I noticed that they were kind of twinkling and moving together in the same direction.  First they went right, down, then appeared to be kind of heading toward the airport, when the one I could keep track of made almost a complete circle.  We don’t have anything on Earth that could fly that fast or maneuver in that way! I could not ! make out a shape because it was to far away but the bright light and maneuvering techniques fascinated me enough to find out how to report it and who to report it to!      Thank you for listening.  I hope it wasn’t to long and drawn out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.1031258064516;-85.678195967742
