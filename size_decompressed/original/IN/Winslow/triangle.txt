My brother and I were sitting inside the house when he spotted an orange glow through the window in the door.  He asked to to come and look at it through the window.  I too witnessed the bright orange glow that seemed to light up the ground and sky.  We then went outside to get a better look.  Once outside we both witnessed six objects in the sky.  They were grouped in pairs.  There were 4 lights, 3 in front-almost in a row-and one in back, forming a triangle shape on the object.  The light in back was  red-the three in front were white-appearing a bit yellowish-blinking in sequence from left to right.  They were lower in the sky than the stars and lower than most airplanes, moving quite rapidly.  When one object would blink another object would blink back.  One pair flew directly over our heads.  This is when we saw the most detail as discribed above.  The three pairs were spaced in three different directions in the sky all flying in approximately the same direction.  They then disappeared.  It was a very clear night.;38.3657;-87.2269
