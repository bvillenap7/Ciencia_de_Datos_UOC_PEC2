Actually I have 3 sightings. One, was in the western sky, very far away, about 9:00 high.  It was rectangular in shape, and was a faint red.  It was moving very slowly across the sky in a southerly direction.  After noticeing that one, I turned around, heading back to the house, when I noticed a very bright red light, flashing, in the eastern sky about 10:00 high, much closer than the one to the west.  I also noticed a couple of planes fliing northbound in front of it.  As I kept watching it, I noticed a couple of Air Force jets to the south of the object.  They seem to have been heading for the light.  I ran in to get my camera, and when I came back out, the light had became very dim red.  The planes were still in the area of the object.  I turned on the video recorder on my camera, and all I could see was a red ball- like object, moving around on the screen.  I will send you a copy of what I recorded.  As I turned to come in the house, I noticed another bright light to the south, coming in my direction, slowly.  I kept watching for a few seconds to see what it was, when I noticed another jet approaching that object also.  Then, all the sudden, the object vanished. I am not crazy!!  This happens around here all the time.   My fiance and I have several other witnesses to events we seen occur this past summer.;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313
