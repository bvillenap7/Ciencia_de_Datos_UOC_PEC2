Formation of 6 silent white lights that hovered and dissappeared.;2005-04-16 21:30:00;<60 seconds;Formation of 6 silent white lights that hovered and dissappeared. On April 16, 2005 at 21:30, myself and 2 other adults saw a series of about 6 white/yellow round lights in formation in the western part of the night sky. Initially, the lights stood still then the northen end of the formation began to move upwards, and then disappeared. The lights made no noise and did not appear to resemble any type of aircraft usually seen in the area. The sky was mostly clear. I saw a very similar formation in October of 2002.  That sighting took place in Indiana near the intersection of US31 N and SR 38 at about 22:30. The sighting were nearly identical.;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313
Bright Yellow lights moving in unison, and then dropping straight down.;2008-04-16 22:27:00;1 minute;Bright Yellow lights moving in unison, and then dropping straight down. Since I got off the phone with you, I did what you asked. It was west where the lights were from. And since I missed most of this light show my dad said that the lights moved outward and to the left, outward and to the right, and then straight down. I tried calling news stations, but lines were busy. Channel 6 News helicopter is flying over the area right now. It's kind of wierd because we heard a loud explosion, the lights moved and did their thing, and then they fell crashing down. You would think that the explosion noise would have followed all of this??? The police are looking in fields and in homes with flashlights and they originally thought a plane crashed, but they can't find a plane? This could all be a coincidence... we'll hopefully soon find out.;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313
4 or 5 yellow lights in the sky followed a loud explosion noise. They moved in perfect unison, if one went to the left, they all moved.;2008-04-16 22:27:00;2 minutes;4 or 5 yellow lights in the sky followed a loud explosion noise. They moved in perfect unison, if one went to the left, they all moved. We heard a big loud noise, almost like an explosion. My dad and brother ran outside while I was on the phone with my dad.  My brother tried video taping it, but I'm not sure how much he got because it happened so quick.  My dad said, There are like 4 or 5 yellow lights all moving in unison to the left and now to the right. They just suddenly disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports to the local media, we understand.  We do not know what the objects were, but there is a possibility that they were caused by a military exercise.  However, military aircraft are not allowed to fly supersonic over populated areas.  We would welcome reports from any other witnesses.  PD));40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313
