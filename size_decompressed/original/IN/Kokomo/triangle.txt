Black triangular object observed hovering over a residential area in Kokomo, IN during the summer of 1997.;1997-07-15 23:30:00;5 - 10 minutes;Black triangular object observed hovering over a residential area in Kokomo, IN during the summer of 1997. This sighting occurred during the summer of 1997.  I wish I remembered a more accurate date, but I did not record any information after it occurred family and friends basically made me feel embarrassed for telling this story… which is why I have not formally reported it until now.  I was age 17 at the time of this event.  In the summer of 1997, I lived in Kokomo, Indiana, and at about 11:30 PM on a weeknight, I was on my way (driving) to a local Kroger store to see my girlfriend off of work.  I was on S Dixon Rd., heading north as I passed over some train tracks and began approaching a bridge when I noticed a solid bright white light at my 1 or 2-o-clock in the sky.  At first I thought it was pretty far away, but as I continued to drive north I realized that the object was now at my 3-o-clock, and so was actually very close to me.  At this time, I became curious and turned right on to W King St., which appeared to lead directly to the hovering object.  As I drove towards the object, I pulled up to a house in the residential area that this object was apparently hovering over.  The house was on my right, and so I stuck my head out of the driver’s side window and looked over the hood of my car, up above this house… to see a large black triangular object with 3 bright white lights at each tip, and in the center of the triangle was one large deep red circle (facing downward at the house).  I was fortunate to have been able to observe this object from such a close distance I remember it being about 150 yards away from me while it hovered over the house.  I was also amazed at how quietly the object hovered, as I remember hearing nothing over the sound of my own car engine.  I sat with my head out of the window observing the large triangle for about 1½ minutes before the object began to slowly rise and move in a NW direction, after which it then took off at very high velocity.  As far as I know, I was the only observer of this object, as almost all of the houses in the neighborhood appeared to have their lights off and I saw no other cars on the road.  I never heard of any news of a sighting reported by anyone else after that evening. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
