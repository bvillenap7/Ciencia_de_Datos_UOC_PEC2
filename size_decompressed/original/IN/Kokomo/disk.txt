Anyways I thought it was kind of funny how the hair was standing on my arm but I went ahaed and put my jacket on got out of the car and went inside for a minute. As Iw as in the house I heard something outside and went to the kitchen window and looked out towards the back yard and saw some light. I was thinking it was a flashlight or something like that and went outside and then it happened...My hairs started standing up on my arms again as I was walking around the backside of the house I just happened to look up and seen a circular object lightly illuminated hovering about 50 ft to 75 ft in the air over the house. It was glowing from a blue to white haze. I had no sound at all. The sound I heard before I went to look was like someone coughing outside or something. It sat there and hovered for about ten minutes and then slowly started moving from side to side for about 3 minutes, then just like BAM it shot off to the north and and dissapeared.;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313
Large object of amber lights hovering very low.;2006-03-21 21:05:00;10 seconds;Large object of amber lights hovering very low. On Tuesday, March 21st, 2006 at 9:05pm my girlfriend and i pulled into the gas station to get some cigarettes. She went in and i stayed in the vehicle. I was looking down at the radio and changing stations listening for a good tune when my girlfriend returned to the vehicle. Upon her getting in i raised my head and seen directly in front of us multible amber lights hovering over Marsh Supermarkets about 100 feet high and a parking lot distance away form us. Very close! I started saying (in a raised tone of voice) to my girlfriend and pointing, look! look! what is that? She looked and saw it also, as it was starting to fade.  We were both astonished at what we were witnessing. We were on the corner of South Lafountain and Southway BLVD. facing east. These lights appeared to be in a disc shape and faded   from right to left in a rather quick motion. This object of lights being as low as it was and as close as it was seemed to be very large and silent. Now, this all happened rather quickley, about 10 seconds in all from the time i first noticed it. I am always watching the skies and have seen lights before like this but never in town and so damn close. Actually, it is a little nerving. MY girlfriend to my knowledge has never witnessed anything like this before and now i think she understands all the interest i and so many other people have in this subject. We both had a spectacular sighting of something very large, very low and very close with amber lights that just faded  quickly in a right to left motion and then dissappeared. This was just extrodinary to see. Wow!;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313
Disks spinning over markland dispersing glowing balls.;2014-03-30 01:30:00;2 minutes;Disks spinning over markland dispersing glowing balls. I was driving down markland, by markland mall and 31 when I noticed a shining circular disk in the sky,  pulled over to make sure and just as I did that,  it started spinning faster and two other disks came out and formed a triangular shape, while continuing to spin...  They dispersed millions of 'ball' like things which were glowing, then disks flew off very quickly and the glowing balls vanished,  I'm still very shocked.;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313
