daytime sighting;2007-09-29 12:15:00;5-6 minutes;daytime sighting I was in uptown Kokomo,IN about noon,and was watching two jets and their trails as they entersected. Me and a friend were commenting on how odd it is too see two jets cross paths like that and so on. Then I seen a white, round object very high in the sky,and told my friend to check it out. It wasn't moving just staying in the same place,and Hovering, I guess. So I went and told a few others to check it out. we were watching it for a couple minutes,and I noticed another one to the west,doing the same thing,both identical in color and size. I went to get more people to see it,(cause I had no clue as to what it was,) And when I got back they were both gone. that fast. They were hard to see unless you just happen to be staring into the sky where they were. So I doubt anyone else may have seen them.
