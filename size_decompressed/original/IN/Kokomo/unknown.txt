Some moved in a zig-zag motion, then would dart from left to right and then stay motionless.   Half hour into witnessing this and all disappeared into thin air, after shooting upwards as a bright white light,  10 minutes later reappeared in same spot as they have been.   They waited for a regular human aircraft to pass, then all but one disappeared while the one followed the airplane.  It would follow right up to the tail and then stop, then follow again and then stop.  Carried on for approxiamtely 2 more miles.   My brother, fiancee, and I all witnessed this and are absolutely dumbfounded but amazed to have experienced another UFO experience!;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313
