I've never seen anything like it....ever.  Brighter than stars, almost fire-like in color.   Tonight there was something like a pattern of three fireball lights in a row (like a straight line) and then a fourth fireball appeared...then they faded out.    1st sighting late summer/early fall 2004: The first time I seen these lights of fire....I was a mile west of my home coming to a stop sign.   I'm an aviation freak, so I'm always looking for small general aviation planes (day or night).   The lights were so bright, it naturally grabbed my attention.   It didn't look like airplane lights flying directly toward me...looked like fire.  I seriously started to wonder if there was a mid-air with two planes, a plane with an engine fire....or even a flare from a flare gun.   Totally unexplainable ...it only lasted about 30 seconds to less than a minute.  (thought I would never see it again).   Months later it happened a second time (later 2004).   I was on the same road in my truck heading in the same westerly direction....towards that same stop sign.  After turning north at the stop sign (where I sat a few secs longer this time), I drove slower and tried to keep an eye out to my left.   (nothing else that night).  I couldn't believe it saw it again.   So this evening, I'm taking the dog out to potty and up in the night-time westerly sky are those very same looking lights or fireballs again.   All times were around 8pm with night sky.  Now I've gotta know.....what is it?   I'm get a little crazy sometimes, but seeing this same phenom three separate times on different dates only confirms that I'm really seeing something. I surely cannot be the only person in central Indiana who is seeing this happen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313
Odd Orangeish lights.;2005-03-21 21:00:00;45 minutes;Odd Orangeish lights. Wile heading home last night with a friend I saw a object to the NW that at first looked somewhat like a normal plane but was not flashing at all & had a distincitve orange hue in color. Suddenley another light just like it appeared below it & the first light slowley dimmed out than re appeared, than a third lit up below them, before fading out one by one going from center, top,than bottom. The lights lasted for mabey a minute to a minute & a half. This is the second time I have witnessed an event like this & it really has my curisioty going now. I had posted to this sight the last time I saw lights like this but have not seen the report posted yet. Anyway after getting home I stood outside for awhile & witnessed several more lights again with my friend & my wife. The first I had seen started with a single light in the NW than one to the W than three more in between them spaced a good distance appart, I would guess a couple miles or more. Each light dimmed out(dont recall the exact order)one by one until they were all gone, than two in the center re appeared shortley, followed by the first one in the NW for a couple seconds before they all faded out. These lasted for around two minutes. We all stood waching for about another 15 minutes & witnessed three more single lights through the W & NW sky, all acting the same. They would light up than slowley dim out & usualy re light for just a second or two before dimming out again. We also noticed there was quite a few normall aircraft flying around, most of them were noticed directley above us or to the East with a couple coming from the NW & heading & all heading North. Or from where we are, heading directley in the direction of Grissom Air Force Base. No (normal) planes were noticed around the lights or where they were seen.;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313
