Yellow lights seen above the Kokomo Indiana sky;2002-09-18 21:20:00;10 minutes;Yellow lights seen above the Kokomo Indiana sky My son and I were driving home, going south on US 31.  He was looking to the west and saw a very bright light in the sky that was still in the sky.  It looked almost like a very bright star and appeared to be yellow.  He then told me that the light just faded out like a watch tower light.  I then turned west on Center Road.  After I went about a mile down the road my son saw the light again.  It was straight ahead, in the distance in the southwest sky.  Then there appeared another light in a line next to it.  The lights did not appear to be moving in the sky - just standing still.  After about 3 to 5 seconds they both faded away.  About 2 seconds later they both appeared in the northwest sky.  Then after another 5 seconds they faded away.  We were still driving west on Center Road, just past the Dixon Road intersection.  About 10 seconds later just one light appeared in the northwest sky.  It did the same thing, appeared still in the sky and then faded out.  We then continued home and ran into the house to get our camcorder.  Right when we walked out the door a bright light zoomed directly overhead at an extremely fast speed.  We stayed outside about another 15 minutes but were unable to find the lights again.  I did notice a flash of what appeared to be heat lightening, but there were no clouds in the sky.  The lightening didn't look like normal heat lightening but appeared to be in a band going across the sky.  It was very faint as it happened and only happened once while we were outside.;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313

It was a ball of light obviously heading toward where it came from.;2005-07-18 21:00:00;about 45 seconds;It was a ball of light obviously heading toward where it came from. I was, ironically watching a National Geographic special about U.F.O.s I went outside, to see how bad it had rained when I saw a craft, at first I said, look, a U.F.O. but everyone thought i was joking. As I walked out it just stopped, like it saw me & was  scared to move, it just hovered about (possibly) 300 meters in the air, then I went in & I went back out literally 5 seconds later, it was gone. It couldn't have been a star there were to many clouds to even see the moon. It had no sound & it was at a range that you couldn't have not noticed it if it were a plane. It was heading south when I had noticed it, then it stopped.I suppose it was acending when I happened upon it. So I hope this helps if there is an investigation.;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313

Aircraft or Flares? Two flickering balls of light hovering for hours.;2006-03-22 23:00:00;Hours;Aircraft or Flares? Two flickering balls of light hovering for hours. For the past two nights around 10 pm, there have been a number of light formations appearing in the west sky. At first I thought they were flares being dropped, but then after they kept re-appearing I noticed how they did not behave like free falling flares would. They did not decend in the least bit and their glow dwarfed the tiny flickering of aircraft that appeared off an on in the same area. I also realized that there was no military base in that area. They did appear like flares would though- simultaneously igniting and then vanishing in the same order and timing sequence in which they appeared- so they could just be a special type of training flare that would behave differently or parachute slower... but the more mysterious lights came later. I was doing a search for them when I came across the article of the person below me from the same area in Indiana. We saw the same type of lights, only I saw 2 and on a different night tonight. In the same area of the sky that the flare-like lights appeared, there were, and still are, two bigger-than-star sized lights that are flickering and sort of just hanging out. They are not planes because they haven't moved left or right, or gotten bigger or smaller in hours. They are not planets because I know where venus and mars are located, and these are not them. These two lights, depending on how big they are, seem to be about a mile or two apart. They are flickering white/yellow/blue/red. These are not Helicopters. They are too high and too still. Helicopters do not hover for hours on end. The only other strange event of the evening is that a friend who also witnessed the lights said tonight that her business, which was toward the direction of the lights, began to suffer electrical surges when the lights came. Her store lights flickered and her computer shut off. She said she witnessed the flares, only once they dissapeared, it was only for a 2 seconds and they re-appeared and then was also told that other businesses in the same area were having power troubles. I'm sure there is a reasonable explaination for this, but at the current time these are lights that belong to an aircraft which are not identifiable to me. Thus, I'm calling them UFO's.;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313

3 orange lights in formation fading on and off over city  & fields.;2008-03-06 20:00:00;15- 20 MIN;3 orange lights in formation fading on and off over city  & fields. March 6th 2008, traveling north on US 31, just south of Howard county.  While driving my boyfriend and I spoted an yellow orange light in the sky, a little closer than planes fly, but still pretty up there-  the glowing light appered  then faded away. A few minutes later the light appeared again and split horizontal in two, then faded away. The light appered a third and four time split horizontally into three lights all fading away. Twenty minutes later we arrived very excited at our desination only to see this happen two more times with my boyfriends dad!  We Also saw a jet head toward the objects before they went away. This is my third encounter of this kind in/around Howard County- all lights fading on and off, all different formations! Wow!;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313
Lights circling the skies of  Kokomo Indiana;2008-04-16 10:30:00;3 minutes;Lights circling the skies of  Kokomo Indiana First we and our neighbors heard a loud sound like an explosion that shock the houses. When we went outside to check things out my husband looked to the sky to the west of our house and yelled for me to look right away. There were several lights circling the sky and when I called my sister she said the boys were telling her they seen the same thing. Three dimmer lights remained in the sky for about another 10 minutes.;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313
Ther was 7 to 9 very bright objects that came from the West sky, stopped, then jetted off to the North.;2008-04-16 22:30:00;15-30 seconds;Ther was 7 to 9 very bright objects that came from the West sky, stopped, then jetted off to the North. They appeared to come in from the west sky, at about a 10 o-clock position in the sky. They appeared in a random cluster, then came together on a gentle curve, heading north to form a line horizontaly. The 7 to 9 bright lights seem to stop simultaniously, then shot off to the North at an incredible speed simultaniuosly., Never loosing thier spacing between each other. This followed an incredible explosive sound, that got the whole town thinking a plane had crashed.

We keep seeing bright orange lights show up in the sky, fading out, and becoming large stars that dash back and forth.;2008-07-22 21:40:00;4 hours;We keep seeing bright orange lights show up in the sky, fading out, and becoming large stars that dash back and forth. I seen 2 bright large orange lights in the western sky, about 10:00 high in sky. They were there for approx. 1 minute,then disappeared. I have seen them many times, in the same area, about the same time everytime. It ALWAYS happens between 9:40pm to 10:40pm almost every night. Recently, I have seen them almost every night! On this paticular night, we seen about 8-10 of them. They only lit up big, for a few minutes, but, remained in the sky until about 1:20AM. They looked like large stars moving back and forth, sometimes very fast, other times slow. They would change directions, speed up, stop, and change directions. Then, would go, at high speeds, to another part of the sky, then stop.We also seen 2 or 3, that were totally different. They looked like saucers, with lights around them, moving very slow.;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313

Observed light for forty-five min before it moved away.;2012-03-19 22:00:00;45 min;Observed light for forty-five min before it moved away. I watched an object in the sky of North central Indiana. The object appeared as a star, but brighter than any normal star in the sky.  Something about the object continuously grabbed my attention and made me pay more attention to it than I would a normal star or planet.  I am certain it was not Jupiter or Venus, due to the fact that both of these planets were visible in the western sky and the object in question was much more northerly in direction.   I observed the light in the sky for close to forty-five minutes from Kokomo, Indiana north along US-31 to the Indiana State route 10 at the town of Argos, Indiana.   As I passed the Argos junction, I noticed the light began moving in a clockwise rotation in front of me.  This lasted almost three seconds for the entire rotation.  The object then proceeded in a north western direction towards Plymouth, IN. I am a truck driver and drive this route five days a week.  I have never noticed anything unusual or strange in the sky and I am very familiar with the stars and planets in the sky at night along this stretch of highway.  The light stayed stationary for close to an hour before moving, but I was drawn to keep looking at it.  There was something different about it, but I am still not sure what it was besides the movement at the end of the event. I was very shaken by the experience and really need to get some grasp on what I have seen.  I have never seen anything stay stationary for so long and rocket off with such speed.  I truly have no idea what I observed, but I know it was no plane or planet.;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313
Orange light flying very slowly around Kokomo, Indiana.;2015-06-21 22:15:00;4 minutes;Orange light flying very slowly around Kokomo, Indiana. While standing outside, I noticed an orange light traveling way too slow to be an airplane, and there was no sound of a helicopter.   I went and called a friend to the door so she could see it, and we observed the craft for about 2 or 3 minutes together.  It made no sense and movements, but just travelled extremely slowly across the sky.  Then, in an instant disappear, completely.   The clothes that seem to be orange in color and did not blink did not flash or have any lights on it like a normal aircraft.;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313
Bright Lights Moving Erratically over Kokomo, IN.;2020-06-30 22:05:00;15 minutes;Bright Lights Moving Erratically over Kokomo, IN. My wife and myself were sitting on our balcony when I glanced upwards at the moon. Conditions were mostly clear, with some high cirrostratus hanging in the moonlight.  I saw a bright light hanging by the moon, which at the time was perhaps 70 degrees above the horizon.  At first, I mistook this light for Venus.  It possessed a yellow-white color similar to Venus when the planet is bright. After pointing the light out to my wife, I noticed that the light was solid, failing to twinkle the nature that stars and planets do.  As we sat, perplexed, the light began to move, retaining its brightness.  The light moved southwards, hanging just above the treeline.  We reasoned that the light must have been emitted by a helicopter, or was perhaps a lantern (which are commonly lit and sent into the sky leading up to the forth of July). Suddenly, the light changed colors, dimming shifting to a magenta somewhere between red and purple.  Following the change in color, the light began moving erratically, shooting upwards and circling in a manner that defied our understanding.  The abrupt changes in direction and altitude would undoubtedly be impossible for an aircraft to achieve. As we sat watching this light above the treeline, it seemed to edge closer to our balcony.  As it neared, it again shone bright, bright enough to illuminate the street below and our surroundings moderately.  The light continued to inch closer, changing to magenta again, then brightening significantly.  It seemed very close, we were honestly a bit frightened by the intensity and movement of the object during these lighting cycles. The object continued to move what appeared to be southwards of our location, as it moved it became obfuscated in part by the treeline.  Even when behind the trees, the brightness of the light was visible through the branches.  The object continued to move erratically. Pausing, gliding, then circling quickly in the sky.  Just prior to our losing of the object beyond the trees, we saw another light.  This one hung farther in the distance and was much more purple in color than red.  We did not see this second object illuminate as the first continued to do so.  Resultantly, we quickly lost the second object beyond the trees. Prior to losing the first object, I managed to record a 1 minute video of the first object, appearing as a grainy spot of light hanging above the trees.  Near the end of my video, the object ascends, illuminates and cuts into the trees.  Even in the video, the brightness of the object can be seen through the branches of the trees. I stood vigil for some time after having seen the object.  Employing a plane-tracking radar app, I scanned the airspace around us, failing to find a plane that was or had traveled along the path in the sky we saw the object. Writing this a few hours later, I am quite perplexed.  We live perhaps 10 or 20 miles south of a air force base, albeit all this activity happened in the opposite direction of the base itself.;40.4803488188976;-86.1434157480313
