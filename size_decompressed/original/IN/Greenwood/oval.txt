My husband and I were sitting on the patio at 11:00 pm.  I saw a huge ball of fire coming from the southeast, across the sky, getting bigger as it came towards us.  It looked like a balloon with a giant fire inside it.   It was very high in the sky. This fire ball was not a plane, it zig-zagged a little as it came forward.  It flew just under the clouds and we had a clear view.  It then veered to the left and disappeared for a few minutes, then the huge oval shape turned black when the fire disappeared.  At that point it looked like a dark rectangular parachute against the slightly lit night sky. It went down to the northeast, the parachute seeming to land behind the trees to the northeast of us. We were stunned when we looked back where it had come from and saw another ball of fire coming from the same direction.  This one followed a straighter path from southeast to northwest.  This fireball also disappeared, changing  into a black spot in the sky, and seemed to go down behind the trees in the distance to the northwest. These both started as oval balls of fire and changed to black rectangular parachute shapes after they lost their light. We did take pictures and videos.;39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919
