Strange object at high rate of speed over Indiana sky;2008-03-13 00:58:00;about 2 seconds;Strange object at high rate of speed over Indiana sky Approximately 12:58 AM i was outside smoking a cigarette when i observed an object moving at an extremely high rate of speed moving in a NorthWest direction, the object looked in the night sky to be cigar shaped with two distinct lights on opposite ends with a bit of a haze or blur surrounding it, the lights seemed to be a light shade of red, almost pink, I observed it for only about 2-3 seconds before it was gone, it was moving on a straight path,  i do not believe in UFO'S but I no what i saw was not a meteor, nor was it like any aircraft i have ever seen, I don't know what to think, i've never seen anything like that before.;39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919
