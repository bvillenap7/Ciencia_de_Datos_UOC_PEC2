Greenwood Indiana blinking lights seen during Lunar Eclipse;2015-09-27 21:45:00;45 minutes;Greenwood Indiana blinking lights seen during Lunar Eclipse 21:45 9/27  While watching the lunar eclipse through my binoculars I noticed 2 red blinking flights move in a strait line downward.  Always maintaining same distance apart.  The blinking red lights moved downward behind my neighbors house.  I moved position and saw the same lights change direction approx 45 degrees upward always maintaining same distance which led me believe it must be a craft.  It then smoothly moved strait upward and out of sight.  The moon was 90% eclipsed at that point.;39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919
