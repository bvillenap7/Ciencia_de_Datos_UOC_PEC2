Plane-like except much smaller, shorter, and slower.;2014-07-23 02:10:00;2 minutes;Plane-like except much smaller, shorter, and slower. My mother and I were driving down the road late this evening when we noticed what appeared to be an airplane.  We thought it was odd seeing an airplane so low to the ground.   As we drove close I realized that, while the craft was shaped like a plane, it contained more to its shape than a plane.  It had an extra barrel and it was shorter than a normal plane.  It was just the one craft.  However, unlike a normal plane, it was much lower to the ground, had a darker paint job, was very thin, flew very very slowly, and had lights in a triangle formation on the bottom of it.  It made no noise and left no trail in the sky. Once I saw the craft, I pointed out to my mother that it was much different than a normal airplane.  She suggested that we turn around and take a closer look.   We drove down the road maybe 100 feet before making a U-Turn.  When we returned to the spot where we had seen the craft, the return was less than a minute, we saw no sign of the craft.  It was there one minute and gone the next.   We even drove further down the road in hopes of seeing it again or maybe even a sign that it was still there.  However there was no sign of the craft we had seen.;39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919
Dark Pill Shape with High sounds;2020-05-20 00:34:00;30 seconds;Dark Pill Shape with High sounds I heard a very loud sound, I thought a plane was coming in low at first. then the sound changed. it was high and low almost interwaving.  I looked out the window only to see this weird pill shaped object hovering while maneuvering in these odd circle patterns.  It was darker than everything around it but that made it almost more noticable. it was extremely low and shaking/vibrating.  Out of no where it zoomed out so fast i couldnt really tell which way it went.;39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919
