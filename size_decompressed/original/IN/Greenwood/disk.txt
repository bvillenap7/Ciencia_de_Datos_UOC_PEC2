My fiance' and I were sitting at the barn talking and I got up to walk back to our pasture.  I was standing and looking at the stars and noticed a bright red light to the west of where i was standing which I thought was a planet.  I looked around the sky and realized it was too big to be a planet.  I looked back at the red object and saw it was getting closer to me.  It was flying low and was a disk or saucer shape.  It was a bright white light on the outside and red on the inside of the disk.  Inside the red circle of light was another white object that I would call a ship.  It was like a squared off upside down heart shape.  I realized that what I was seeing was a UFO.  It came towards me and traveled very slowly.  It made NO sound.  It passed me and was to the east of me when I could see the front end of the disk begin to ascend.  It then shot straight upward and eastward and was out of sight in ! less than 2 seconds.  I was not scared and it was the most awesome thing I've ever seen.;39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919
