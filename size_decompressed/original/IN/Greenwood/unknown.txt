I was out with my family and I had just gotten back from the store. Well I kept hearing my mom and sister say, what the f... and I looked up and there were 3 orange dots making a triangle, and 2 other dots on each other.  My sister rushed in and got my dad and when I went to take a picture of the triangle my phone started to glitch really bad. When my dad got outside the triangle had started to change and I don't know how to explain the shape it was in.  I recorded it though. That same night my friend sent me a picture of a triangle with 3 white lights from his bedroom window.  While all this was going on my cat was acting really weird and attacked my sister and he never does that.;39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919
