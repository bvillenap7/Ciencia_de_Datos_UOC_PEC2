String of orange lights appeared in southern sky.;2008-01-22 19:08:00;5-10 seconds;String of orange lights appeared in southern sky. At about 7:10pm my wife, my daughter, and I were south bound on US Hwy 31 approaching Smith Valley Rd.  To our 2:00 low at first appeared one orange light then another, then three or four more.  All the lights seemed to be connected in that as the first    one we saw appear, disappeared.  They all traveled in apparent trajectory of about 45 degrees.  They moved in a downward direction along this path.  We thought at first it may have been fireworks.  The angle was wrong.  The light was different.  And when they flashed they seemed to not “sparkle” like fireworks.  The night sky was clear.  The moon was full yesterday.  It was about 15 degrees Fahrenheit.  We can not believe we actually saw this.  All three lanes of the highway were occupied.  We are not the only ones who saw this.  We wonder who else may report it though.  Being in this kind of shock is pretty exciting.  Ironically tonight when I came home I switched on National Geographic only to see Peter Jennings reporting on UFOs.;39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919
Orange fireballs over Greenwood, IN;2011-07-02 20:30:00;5 min;Orange fireballs over Greenwood, IN We were walking down the sidewalk and noticed 4-5 orange round objects come up from over the houses to the south of us.  There was no noise.  2-3 others joined them, and they proceeded to move very quickly to the northeast, climbing so high that we could not see them any longer.  My daughter video taped the objects with her phone, but when we went to view it, it was gone.;39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919
Six Fireballs Spotted;2011-07-04 22:00:00;30 minutes;Six Fireballs Spotted This evening, July 4, 2011, my family and I went outside to watch the fireworks being let off in the areas surrounding our neighborhood.  As we watched the display, I noticed a nearly steady orange ball of light move across the sky, moving from the north to the south. I initially thought it was a burning ember being blown away from the fireworks, but the light continued as the object moved almost the complete distance of the visible sky.  As it moved past us and on further south, it flickered a few times and then went out. We stayed outside for about half and hour, and during that time we saw a total of six of these objects moved across the sky in the same direction.  They didn’t follow the same path as each other, but they all did move north to south, some of them extinguishing their light sooner than others.  They were not all grouped together, but at one time there were two of them in the sky at the same time. During this time, there were various airplanes flying overhead, so you could see the difference in their lights.  These objects did not have the flashing lights that the airplanes did.;39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919

15+ Fireballs seen in formation in Greenwood Indiana Bright Red glow changing to an orange than a white flash before returning to red.;2013-05-04 22:00:00;30 minutes;15+ Fireballs seen in formation in Greenwood Indiana Bright Red glow changing to an orange than a white flash before returning to red. Upon leaving my subdivision located off of Fry Road heading north I noticed a line of fireball (red in color changing to an orange glow that would flash white and then go back to red) in the western sky.  I could count 15 distinct fireballs with a trail of many more beyond that.  They were in a line formation hovering (or moving slowly east) about the distance of a small plane above the tree line.  I headed east and went to my destination upon returning 5-10 minutes later to my neighborhood.  I noticed the same fireballs (fewer) in a V formation a little north of my first sightings.   I had called my husband upon the first sighting and told him to look in our backyard.  He saw two that disappeared quickly upon his gaze.   I went home and picked him up.  We saw 2 in the western sky over a neighborhood directly west of us.  One was lower while the second was further up.   We stopped our car almost directly below it and my husband took out his phone to take a pi! cture.  I gave him mine with a telephoto lens and while taking the picture it disappeared faster than our eyes could focus.  Upon returning home his picture was just the black sky no fireball and my phone was a white as a piece of paper.   No orbs or lights were seen in either picture.;39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919
