5 orange lights moving slowly, then faster, in somewhat of a formation for about 2 - 3 minutes.;2007-07-05 22:37:00;2 min;5 orange lights moving slowly, then faster, in somewhat of a formation for about 2 - 3 minutes. I was traveling east on US31 in Greenwood Indiana on July 5th, at approximately 22:37 and saw two lights in the sky about 1 mile up, heading east to west, side by side. Their color   was light orange, about the size of a small star, moving slowly. I watched them for about 30 seconds and pulled into a parking lot next to US31. I then got out of my car, grabbed my camera, and by the time I had it turned on, they were gone. I got back into my car about to leave, and saw another one moving the same direction, same speed. So I got out again, got my camera, pointed it in the area of the light, and it was gone moving a little faster now. I waiting a few seconds, and saw another one, moving the same direction, and speed, This time I got it on video for about 10 seconds, and it faded away. I started to get back into my car, and then a fifth object came into view, heading the same direction, but a little faster, I was not able to get this one on video, to fast. The last three objects were in a single file line, about a mile behind each other. The first two were very close together, and side by side. All were the same color, and sort of flickering, but not flashing. They were no more then a few  miles from where I was standing. 							 I am 47 years old, and was out doing surveillance for a client that night, so I did have a couple cameras with me. I do not drink, or do drugs, and I don’t know what it was that I saw, but it did not look like normal aircraft. The footage is a little shaky at one point, but there are a few seconds that were fairly clear, and still.;39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919
a red light floated across the sky that looked like a bright red star, but flew like an airplane;2008-10-27 00:30:00;30 seconds;a red light floated across the sky that looked like a bright red star, but flew like an airplane I am a 25 year old married female who has two kids and is going to school for a social work degree. I find astronomy very interesting and have been observing and studying the constellations in the night sky for about the past year. I even subscribe to an astronomy magazine so I am familiar with things in the night sky, but had never seen something like what I saw in the early morning of October 26. I was with my husband and we had just parked out in the country to look at the constellations. We were facing east when I saw a red light, not blinking or leaving a tail, come up from the southern sky and head north. It looked like it was going in a straight line. I could not tell if it was in the sky where plains fly or in outer space. It basically looked like a red star but moved across the sky like a plane. It took about 30 seconds for it to go across the sky. There were actual planes flying around that night and this did not look like any plane I have seen. I know this was not a meteor because it did not have a tail and stayed in the sky longer than a meteor would. It did not have any other lights on it and I couldn’t tell what it was, I just know it was a red light that flew across the sky.;39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919
Cherry red light, hovering in NW over Fireworks display, then turning 90 degrees and shooting SE at a rapid speed!;2017-07-02 22:15:00;6-7 minutes;Cherry red light, hovering in NW over Fireworks display, then turning 90 degrees and shooting SE at a rapid speed! While watching a local fireworks display originating from a nearby church over the lake behind my house,  I observed an object with a flashing, cherry red light, at a very high altitude in the north western area of the sky.    It was hovering in one place, as if observing the fireworks below. The red light flashing object remained hovering in one place for 3 or 4 minutes, then it made a 90 degree turn and quickly streaked to the southeastern area of the sky and disappeared in a southerly direction as if following the inter-state highway south, in the direction of northern Kentucky. I looked on the Internet to find out what kind of aircraft would have a cherry red,  flashing light, but I did not find any helpful information.  There were no other colors of light being emitted from the object, I watched until it was out of sight looking for the usual colored lights, but none were ever visible, just the one flashing red light. I have never seen an aircraft move with such speed or with such abrupt 90 degree turns as this object presented.;39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919
Two Orange lights in formation over Greenwood, Indiana.;2018-07-07 22:25:00;2 minutes;Two Orange lights in formation over Greenwood, Indiana. While driving southbound on SR 135 between Stones Crossing and Olive Branch, all 4 occupants in my car observed 2 orange lights flying from SE to NE.  When we first saw the lights, they were east of SR 135.   We decided to pull over into Dyes Walk Golf Club to observe the lights.  We got out of the car, and observed the following.  Both lights/craft appeared to be traveling between 2000-3000 feet and a speed of around 200 knots.  We could hear no noise from the lights/craft.   The trailing light when above us, moved up next to the other light and maintained side by side formation.  That light then suddenly disappeared.  The other light continued moving NW for another 30 seconds or so, getting dimmer, then brighter, then accelerated at a high rate of speed and completely disappeared. Both my self and my wife (who was also one of the observers in the car) are both career pilots.  I know how airplanes move and what the exterior lighting should look like.  No aircraft uses orange lights, and I’ve never in my long career have witnessed anything like this.  It was truly astounding.  I made a phone call to the Indianapolis Airport control tower/TRACON apx 30 min later and described the event to the supervisor. He stated they did not observe anything of that nature on radar or from the tower.;39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919
Stationary to slow moving ball of light, 3 nights in a row.;2018-07-18 23:00:00;1 hour;stationary to slow moving ball of light, 3 nights in a row. In July of 2018, my daughter noticed a light in the sky, maybe a mile from our house.  It was stationary for about 10 minutes then slowly moved off to the north.  We couldn't see where it went because of the trees.  The next night, I was on the back porch, letting my dog out, and noticed another light moving at a very slow pace.  I called my daughter and her friend  and my grandaughter and they wittnessed them also.  There was no blinking lights and no noise.  They were just bright.   The following night i went out the front porch and witnessed the same thing.  This time they were further north, over the south end of Indianapolis.;39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919
