I was sitting on the deck outside enjoying the pleasant evening and looking for meteors. I was looking up at the sky for about 20 minutes when I noticed a massive black triangle moving to the south. On each point there were lights. It made no sound. I'm not sure how far above it was flying. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));39.6052351351351;-86.1374918918919
