Further viewing was obscured by the headlamps of automobiles passing my location at the intersection of SR 8 and SR 39. An commercial passenger aircraft had passed through my field of view just moments before  the faint object was far too high and fast to be an airplane of any conventional kind.;41.2158;-86.777
Two lights in sky  quickly changed positions and took off slowly in opposite directions.;2003-01-15 07:20:00;10 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  We have no idea what the witness apparently witnessed.  PD)) Two lights in sky  quickly changed positions and took off slowly in opposite directions. I am a 20 yr. old girl born in Muncie ,In.Moved to Denver ,Co.Raised in Moore ,Ok.Moved to Columbia,Tn @ age 14 then to North Judson @ age17. I am currently living with my 31 yr.old boyfriend and our 6 month old baby girl.On the date and at the time specified I was on my way to an 8:00 appointment at the welfare office.I was on State highway 10 headed East from the small town of            North Judson ,IN to State highway 35 about 8 mins.My boyfriends mother was driving me I was in the passengers side of the truck .I looked out the passenger side window .I saw two lights beside each other like a pair of eyes which I'll call objects A and B.I'm not sure which one went over and which one went under  but they switched places pretty fast  then took off in opposite directions B headed East along the side of  highway and A headed West.After a short distance I couldn't  see A any longer. I probably could have still seen it if I had looked out the rear window but I didn't.I watched object B instead.I didn't  tell my boyfriends mom I don't know why not but I didn't.Object B was not now going as fast as it previously had when  switching places with object  A .I now had to look  slightly backwards from the passenger window to see Object B.The time had come to turn left or North on to highway 35.I had now lost visual contact  with object B. After traveling on 35 for about 7 more minutes I entered the small city of Knox,In.I turned right or East  down a side road we were supposed to make another right south but we missed our turn so we made the next right turned around in a parking lot,got back onto the side road and turned left or South then made another left or East into the welfare office parking lot the back of the office faces North and the front South we parked in the lot and I went inside.I looked out  the window and seen what could've been object B headed South I watched 'til  it was really small.I turned away convinced of my first  craft sighting.Thanks.Two;41.2158;-86.777
3 to 4 bright glowing oarnge balls in a straight line, then made fast movements in a straight line;2013-10-12 20:00:00;30 seconds;3 to 4 bright glowing oarnge balls in a straight line, then made fast movements in a straight line Hello i am 16 and i have been a major conspirator about aliens being here been here and i was driving in a car and i seen 3 or 4 bright Orangish Redish balls of light in a perfectly straight line and right when i said something about it to my younger twin sister behind me in the back seat and to my friend driving as im in the passesnger it started moving fast towards us but high in the sky and right when it got above us i was looking at it to see if their was wings propellers anything and their wasn't!  And no extra lights to signify to other planes helicopters, etc.  And their was no like light going out infront of it to see where it was going in the night sky.  I then thought maybe i can here if it has a noise and i rolled down the window as my friend slowed down and stopped the car i looked up and listened carefully, no noise what so ever!!  When i look back infront of me the other 3 lights are completely gone like they werent even their.  When i look behind me at the one i was checking out it came to a complete stop right next to another oarnge glowing ball as they sat right next to each other and hovered for about 10 seconds and then flew away very fast then dissapeared! I am not crazy i am not anything but an observer, ig!;41.2158;-86.777
