Large silver sphere/saucer-shaped object that hovered for several minutes. Emitted dots (in data-style format) from side.;1969-06-30 18:00:00;20 min.;Large silver sphere/saucer-shaped object that hovered for several minutes. Emitted dots (in data-style format) from side. I have never reported this, but if I could find some of my old neighbors, I'm sure someone else could confirm this, as many of us saw it.  It began very high in the sky as a bright light (apparently the setting sun reflecting from it). Many of us were outside because it was warm weather, didn't get dark until late...us kids playing back in the days when you had three channels on TV and all doors and windows open because no one had air conditioning.  The object descended very slowly, but was in a straight down descent...no shaking or moving otherwise. It eventually settled right over our street (Phillips Drive) and was huge. It sat there for several minutes. Strange how there were no airplanes going to Weir Cook Airport during the duration of this sighting...usually, we could expect a jet to fly over every 3-10 minutes...they would get low enough to rattle the windows because we were very close to the airport.  Many adults and children stood in their yards watching as word spread quickly.  This craft was directly over my front yard. It was silver in color. At one point, I distinctly saw what looked like six dots (we didn't have computers then, but now I know it looked like computer data) emitted from the left side of the vessel. They were in perfect order.  After the dots were emitted, the object began a very slow ascent, in the same pattern it had followed downward: straight up, gradually.  Eventually it ascended from our sight.  I think everyone on our street made phone calls trying to find out what it was. Dad called the airport and they said it was a weather balloon.  But it wasn't a weather balloon.  I'm now 45 years old and I have never forgotten this experience. I'm a lifelong community journalist and have seen a lot of things, but I have never seen anything to match this.  I wish I could find someone in the old neighborhood who remembers it.

Indianapolis Multi-Colored Round object 1972-74 chased by fighter jets;1972-04-01 19:00:00;1 hour Aprox.;Indianapolis Multi-Colored Round object 1972-74 chased by fighter jets Aproximately 1972-74 west central Indianapolis, Indiana. I was a young boy probably around 7 years old. I was walking back home with my friend coming from his house on a dead end street (Corral & Birtha street)   When we reach the front of my house and sidewalk we noticed a huge round object hovering directly over us.  No sound, I can not explain how huge this was.  We had to actually move our heads back and fourth to see the entire object at one point.  It was rotating with multiple colored lights.  From our vantage point directly under it, it seemed to be like a spoke in a wheel.  The outer edges seemed to be rotating around the center and changing colors as it did that.   Suddenly the object shot straight up in a flash, hardly even able to distinguish between it and stars other than the color looked more orange from the distanced view.  We ran inside to tell my mother and finally we convinced her to come outside to see it.  By that time other neighbors was outside too looking at it.  The object had came back down to it's original position but occasionally would maneuver up, down or left or right and even diagonally.  Some times fast and sometimes slow.  The second time it shot up and was ha! rdly distinguishable between the stars other than the color difference.   We all went back inside and my mother called the police and reported it.  She also called the Air force. Moments later it was on the news on TV.  Wier Cook Airport at the time ( Now Indianapolis International ) had sent 2 fighter jets to intercept it.  We went back outside a third time and seen the jets heading towards the object. Suddenly the object shot straight upwards again so fast... but this time it disappeared completely out of view.  The news that evening said the Air force identified it as being a blown off course weather balloon. The next day it was in the news papers also.  A few day's later me and my friend was walking along side the road in the middle of the day and a blue car and 2  men in air force uniforms stopped us and asked if we saw anything strange in the sky. We told them about it as they took notes.  Then they drove away. I never head anything more about this.  Now I am 46 and still remember it so vividly. I tried researching the news archives without success. If anyone else who witnessed this please post here.  Obviously it was not a blown off course weather balloon. We do not chase weather balloons with fighter jets... I might add... they couldn't catch it...lol  I just wish I could find some archives or documentation on this.   Approximately 1972-75 Summer-time, at night very clear sky.  It was all over the news...  Why can't I find anything on it now?

rapid moving high altitude glowing orange disk moves from horizon to horizon in about 5 seconds;1974-02-19 03:00:00;5 seconds;rapid moving high altitude glowing orange disk moves from horizon to horizon in about 5 seconds I looked up on a clear, cold, starry night while on the driveway preparing to get in my car.  I saw a glowing bright orange circular object which I assume was a disk as I was looking at the circular bottom.  The object appeared to be as high up as typical airplane altitudes, but I was unable to judge the size of the object.  It made no sound and left no trail.  The object came from the western horizon and disappeared into the eastern horizon in about 5 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Metallic disk observed in the sky in broad daylight.;2002-07-13 14:00:00;1 minute;Metallic disk observed in the sky in broad daylight I was working with my brother, who owns a commercial HVAC company, at a site that contained an old communications tower and a building that housed communications equipment.  The site was being prepped for demolition and we had the task of removing air conditioning units.  It was a warm summer day, partly cloudy, with no rain in the forecast.  We had decided to take a break and I decided to lay back on the hood of the truck to relax, looking up into the sky.  While looking at the clouds and daydreaming, that's when I saw a disk-shaped object move laterally from behind a cloud.  It was a metallic disk and appeared dark on the bottom, with no sound, no lights, no trails.  It seemed to hover in place for a few seconds, then it moved back behind the cloud.  It then began to reappear and disappear behind a cloud several times within a span of 15 seconds.  It appeared that it was playing a cat-in-mouse game with any observers below, using the cloud as cover.  Not b! elieving what I was seeing, I decided to sit up and rub my eyes, and try to come to terms with what I was witnessing in broad daylight, and in plain sight.  After taking about 15 seconds to collect myself, I decided to lay back down and look for the object again.  It took about 10 seconds since the clouds were drifting fairly quickly that day, but I found it again, still moving in and out from behind the cloud.  As I continued to watch, it finally did not reappear from behind the cloud after viewing it for approximately 20-30 seconds.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Then I noticed another disk coasting alonge another contrail that was twice as high in the sky. Our eyes felt odd as we observed the second disk we all felt weird . but there was no fearful feeling just a weird feeling . It was a very clear blue sky with no natural cloud's in the sky , just man made clouds , and the 2 disk . ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Drove directly underneath a UFO in Indianapolis, saw the underside and inside of the UFO.;2004-12-20 20:00:00;one hour;Drove directly underneath a UFO in Indianapolis, saw the underside and inside of the UFO. My friend and I were driving cross country from Missouri.  We drove over a hill on I-70 and saw 2 lights in the sky.  We were both immediately drawn to them, and we assumed that it was just a plane.  I commented on the size of the plane considering how far apart the lights were.  We kept watching it and realized that it was not moving.  My friend said that it must be an airplane tower, but as we kept driving we realized that it was directly over the highway and it was not moving.  All we saw was two lights until we were directly in front of it when we realized that it was a ufo.  It was very flat and cylindric and sort of a gray color.  We were both mesmorized by it and everything seemed to just stand still.  The entire trip it had been very windy and the car was knocked around a lot but for the time that we were driving underneath this the wind stopped, there didn't seem to be any weather or temperature.  Neither of us were even paying attention to driving, we were just staring upward at this ship.  As we entered the middle of it it went up into a dome.  There was a flashing red light at the center of the dome, and I don't remember anything after that until we were a few miles away.  We then noticed that there were a lot of lights in the sky and we could still see the ufo in the air behind us.  THe new lights turned out to be a swarm of army helicopters that were all formed together throughout the sky all headed toward the ufo.  I watched the ufo sit there, and then all of a sudden shoot up directly into the sky.  It zoomed around the sky for a while shooting back and forth, almost like it was messing with the helicopters.  It would come right back down to being 200 feet off the ground right behind our car and then it would shoot back up in the air.  We then pulled over and got a hotel room once the ufo vanished for good, but for and hour afterward we saw the apache helicopters in the sky in the same place the ufo was.  There were alot of police officers out also that night zooming down the highway in the same place the ufo was.  My friend had his window down when we went underneath it and when we arrived at the hotel we noticed that he had what looked like a bruise on his face and we were both nauseaus and had very bad migraines.  We took blood tests to test for radiation poisoning and both were inconclusive.  My friend didn't sleep for 3 days after this happened.  Also the same night that we saw it we heard very unnatural things in the air all night, sounds that we have never heard before and things that we can't explain.  The next day my friend and I checked our cell phones to see what time this had occured, since we had made several phone calls and received several in that hour timeframe, and found that our cell phone call list had been deleted.  The calls made before 7pm were still in there and the calls made after 10pm were in there, but the calls during that time were not even in the record.  Also 1/2 tank of gas was gone for some reason.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
MY SON SAID, MOMMY, THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS IN THE SKY THAT LOOK LIKE A UFO!!!!!;2008-03-01 21:00:00;15 min;MY SON SAID, MOMMY, THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS IN THE SKY THAT LOOK LIKE A UFO!!!!!   IT WAS ABOUT 9:00 PM IN THE SPRING OF 08.  MY SON WANTED A TOY FROM THE CAR, SO I TOLD HIM TO GO GET IT.  SUDDENLY, HE CAME RUNNING IN AND SAID, MOMMY, THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS IN THE SKY THAT LOOK LIKE A UFO!   I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED BUT THIS WAS A STRETCH.  I STEPPED OUTSIDE AND THERE IT WAS!  I REALLY WAS INSTANTLY IN SHOCK.  I LOOKED TRYING TO COME UP WITH ANYTHING THAT IT COULD BE BESIDES THE ONE THING I HAD HOPED TO ALWAYS SEE.  NOTHING. THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE IT COULD BE. IT WAS PRETTY LARGE AND THE DETAILS ARE MISSING BECAUSE IT WAS IN A CLOUD OF MIST.  IT WAS TO LOW TO BE AN ACTUAL CLOUD.  IT WAS ABOUT 40 FT IT SEEMED, MAYBE MORE, FROM THE TOP OF MY NEIGHBORS HOUSE.  THROUGH THE CLOUDS IT WAS EMITTING 4 DIFFERENT LIGHTS.  DIMMED OF COURSE, THE COLORS LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE PINK, BLUE, GREEN, WHITE OR CLEAR.  THEY DID BLINK IN A PATTERN. THERE WAS NO SOUND AS IT HOVERED WITH NO MOVEMENT.  I SUDDENLY HAD A FEELING OF FEAR BECAUSE MY SON WAS STILL OUTSIDE WITH ME.  I GRABBED HIS ARM AND WENT INSIDE. AT THIS POINT I WAS PRETTY SHOOK UP AND TOLD MY BOYFRIEND TO LOOK OUTSIDE.  I KNOW HE SAW IT, BUT HE IS NOT A BELIEVER.  TO THIS DAY HE DENIES SEEING ANYTHING (POTENTIAL WITNESS).   AT THIS POINT I WAS STILL PRETTY SCARED, SO I KEPT LOOKING OUT MY SIDE DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS STILL THERE.  MY GUESS IS IT STAYED FOR PROBABLY ANOTHER 10 MINUTES.  THE STRANGEST PART TO ME IS I DIDNT REACT THE WAY I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE.  THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE SEEMS EERIE.  I WOULD HAVE TAKEN A PICTURE, CALLED SOMEONE, OR STAYED OUTSIDE BY MYSELF TILL IT HAD LEFT BUT, I DIDNT.  I DONT REMEMBER MUCH ELSE FROM THAT NIGHT.  THE NEIGHBORS WERE RETIRED NUNS.  I DIDNT ASK THEM ABOUT ANYTHING OUT OF EMBARRASMENT AND OBVIOUSLY THEIR STRONG RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND.  I DID NOTICE SOME INJURIES RIGHT AFTER.  THAT THEY SAID WAS DUE TO SURGERY ON BOTH (AT THE SAME TIME?).   THEN AFTER LIVING THERE FOR MANY YEARS THEY UPPED AND MOVED TO THEIR OLD PARISH.  I NOW KICK MYSELF FOR NOT ASKING ANYTHING ABOUT THAT NIGHT. EVEN STRANGER FOR ME, I DIDNT SAY ANYTHING FOR ABOUT 2 DAYS ABOUT WHAT I HAD SEEN.  I HAD COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN OR BLOCKED OUT, I DONT KNOW,  THE WHOLE THING UNTIL MY BOYFRIEND STARTED TO MAKE FUN OF ME ABOUT WHAT I HAD SAW.  I WOULD HAVE AT LEAST CALLED MY DAD AS WE HAVE A MUTUAL INTEREST IN THE MATTER.  I CANT STOP THINKING ABOUT ALL THAT HAPPENED?  HAS ANYONE HAD A SIMILAR SIGHTING OR EXPERIENCE (WEIRD FEELING, CANT EXPLAIN)?  I WAS COMPLETELY FLOORED!  HOW COULD I FORGET ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN SO IMPORTANT TO ME IN MY PAST, AS WELL AS, NOW IN MY PRESENT?  I AM REALLY BOTHERED BY THIS WITH NO ONE TO TALK TO ABOUT IT.  EVERYONE I KNOW THINKS ITS CRAZY, AM I?   THERE IS SO MUCH EVIDENCE OUT THERE WHY THE SECRECY FROM OUR GOVERNMENTS!  WE NEED TO DEMAND ANSWERS!

At approximatley 10:00 p.m. EST on 7-25-09, I was in the driveway of my home in Lawrence, Indiana, a small town in the northeast section of Marion County (about 10 miles northeast of downtown Indianapolis. A female neighbor accross the street yelled at me, pointing at the northern sky and stated What is that? I immediately looked up and saw 20 to 30 bright yellowish disk-shaped objects, each with an illuminated vertical red center, flying accross the sky with no detectable sound. They were moving west to east about 40 degrees off the horizon at what appeared to be a high rate of speed. They were in a straight formation, although about 30 seconds into this encounter 2 or 3 seemed to break off from the formation and head south towards me for a few seconds, then quickly joined the others in their easterly trek. While I was watching this, the female neighbor's husband also came out of his house and joined his wife and I, who were watching this spectacle from the street. After another minute or so, the objects all disappeared into the eastern sky. I am a 56 year old college-educated male, who spent over 20 years in law enforcement in several different positions. I am currently an in-town truck driver, and I do not use illicit drugs or cosume alcohol. I can offer no logical explanation as to what these objects were that my neighbors and I saw. I hope to find out something about this when I watch the evening news at 11:00 p.m. tonight.  Finally, if someone would have told me I would be making a report to a UFO center, I would have laughed at them. I occasionally listen to Coast to Coast on the radio and always regarded UFO reports as just some type of goofy entertainment. Now I'm not so sure!At 10;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Saucer seen on W. Michigan Street and Porto Alegre;2010-11-08 18:25:00;three minutes;Saucer seen on W. Michigan Street and Porto Alegre I’m a college student in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was around 6:26 P.M. on 11/7/2010 when I was standing on the sidewalk of W. Michigan Street that lead back to campus apartment housing at IUPUI (my college).  We usually have a lot of airplanes and helicopters around here, and at first I thought it was an airplane until I realized that it was flying way too low, but then I realized that it must have been a helicopter. I couldn’t have been more wrong I realized, as I looked up and saw a circular object flying right up above me, moving straight in the direction I was facing. It was huge, and if a full moon were out, I would have to say that from my perspective, I would have to say that maybe 15-17 full moons would be equal to the size of it. I’d like to give a better comparison, but I was in a state of shock. I did spend what felt like a long time gazing at it, although in actuality, only about 2 minutes had passed. The sky was clear, but being in the city, it appears as pitch black because of the city lights. It was either flying really low, or it was extremely huge.  I feel stupid for not thinking about getting a picture, but I was in total shock, as I don’t really believe in UFOs, or at least didn’t until now, and even now I’m still skeptical. I did, however, try my best to draw a picture afterwards, even though I’m not good at drawing. The UFO had red lights on it. If I remember correctly, I’d say about 3 of 4 of them, and I believe that red light was coming from the center as well. Since I was looking up at it, all I could see was what it looked like directly underneath. It looked like the stereotypical UFO, or flying saucer, in most aspects. Besides being a perfect circle, it looked like what a mushroom looks like from underneath, whereas you can see the edges of what might be a domed top from below, and striations leading towards the center. Most of the red lights were towards th! e exterior, with the exception of the center (where the stem of a mushroom would be). Here was where more red light emitted. Two things struck me as odd that distinguished this when compared to the stereotypical portrayal. For one thing, the front of the ship had a silver section, which reminded me of a bird shape since the shape had three corners. Secondly, I think that there may have been a protrusion at the base of it, which logically made me think that maybe somebody was playing a prank and it was actually some type of blimp because of how it glided forward, but it seemed much too big to logically call it this. There was no logical explanation for what happened. I went back to the apartment building and called my grandpa to tell him what I saw because I felt like I needed to tell someone that wouldn’t make fun of me. I made this call at 6:34P.M., and stepped through the back door of the apartment complex. I was partway into the conversation when I saw the object again flying over the apartment building, even though I thought it had already passed. At this point a passerby was walking down the sidewalk and saw me looking in shock up at the sky. He then saw the object too and said that it “sure is a wide airplane”. (He didn’t see it until it was going off into the distance.) I said that “was definitely no airplane.” This second encounter lasted until 6:37P.M., so it was three minutes long. This second encounter took place on Porto Alegre Street, and again the object continued moving in the same direction until it got past the river, where it ascended up and disappeared into the sky. A girl walking a ways behind me during the first incident didn’t bother looking up because she thought it was a helicopter and was busy texting, and was shocked when I told her what I saw. I was kind of angry that she hadn’t looked up and I was the only one that saw this the first time, but I extremely glad that someone else saw it the second time to prove that I wasn’t the only person that saw it. By the way, the IUPUI campus apartments are near the Ronald McDonald House, which is not far from the hospital. This area is extremely easy to find on Google Maps, however, for some reason it doesn’t show Porto Alegre, but the street that the UFO went across to get to the river is White River Pkwy E. Dr.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Large, flat sphere with BRIGHT red and white fast, flashing lights flying in Indianapolis, Indiana.;2013-04-04 21:12:00;30 seconds;Large, flat sphere with BRIGHT red and white fast, flashing lights flying in Indianapolis, Indiana. I went outside to get my sons drink out of my car and I looked up in the sky and saw a large flat object with a curved top flashing red and white lights.   The lights were very bright and blinking in a fast motion.   The object was a lot larger than an airplane and the lights were a lot brighter.  I stared at it for a couple of seconds before yelling for my son to come out and see it.  As he ran out the object seemed to slow down for about 10 seconds and then proceeded to go continue in the northwest direction at a fast speed. It vanished and we couldn't see it anymore.  Afterwards I looked at 3 airplanes that was no where near as big or as bright as this object was in the sky.  Compared to an airplane it was about 30-50 airplanes put together in comparison.

It was in the first week of June 2013.  Dogs were barking like usual suddenly they stopped it was dead quiet and we heard a noise outside not like a plane or helicopter sound very hard to describe the sound.  We got up and tried to look out our window we couldn't see anything so we went out back and looked at the sky.. We didn't see anything right up above even though the sound sounded like it was above or very close to the house.  We looked to our left and down the street.  We saw the UFO hovering near the next street over near the street light.  It was very bright.  The light coming from it was white.   It hovered there for a good 2 minutes.  We had it on video but the phone it was on was stolen sadly. The weirdest thing was how fast it disappeared.  It went faster than the speed of light it was gone within a blink of an eye.  I have never seen or heard a sound like that ever before.   After I watched the video and the way it hovered was like nothing I know of that the USA or anyone has invented.  I don't know anything that can disappear as fast as it did either.  It was round but wasn't flat.  Have not seen any after that.

Noticed a black disc approximately 1,000 feet below about the size of an automobile, no wings.;2017-10-25 11:30:00;20 seconds;Flying at approximately 30,000 feet from Chicago O'Hare to Orlando, FL, over the skies of Indianapolis, IN, my 9 year old daughter got my attention.  What is that black thing near those clouds?  I immediately looked out the Boeing 767 port side window and noticed a black disc approximately 1,000 feet below about the size of an automobile, no wings, no vapor trail and it was perfectly visible because we were above the clouds with the object, contrast of the object was perfect.  My wife also saw the object and asked me, What is that?  That doesn't look like a plane to me!  She is a seasoned flier, over 1,000 flights easy for business and travel, can identify nearly all commercial aircraft.  After about 20 seconds time the object disappeared in the distance heading in a northeast direction.   I'm former Air National Guard, worked for 4 different airlines and Aviation Management major in college.  I know the FAA doesn't allow drones at 29,000 feet, especially in Class Bravo airspace. Familiar with both Air National Guard bases in Indiana and know they do not operate this type of object the 3 of us witnessed.  Daughter later told me the object had a green dot or light on top of disc.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Fourth of July - Very Large UFO Near Geist Reservoir and Marion-Hamilton County Line.;2018-07-04 13:00:00;5 minutes;Fourth of July - Very Large UFO Near Geist Reservoir and Marion-Hamilton County Line. On Fourth of July, 2018 in northern Indianapolis, near Fox Road, and the Marion-Hamilton County line, and Geist Reservoir, at about 1 p.m., I walked into my wide backyard and glanced up. Small, dense white clouds were traveling in a northeastern direction beneath a beautiful blue sky. I was following them across the sky when I noticed that one very large cloud to the near northwest, the exact same color as the rest, was stationary. The big cloud was gently moving, like bubbling or slowly percolating in place, and was thinner or wispier along the edges. The smaller clouds traveled northward above and beside it. Then I focused on something I wasn’t prepared to see. The big cloud was mostly concealing an enormous craft that was not moving. The first impression was of the nose of a cruise ship peeking out of a cloud. The craft’s skin was smooth with no external appendages. Its color was a pale, washed-out, non-reflective gray. There was no sound. There were no lights or lamps. The vessel was close enough that it felt as though I was looking upward from the bottom of a tall cliff. The part of the craft I could observe looked like a 3-layer cake. The top tier was the smallest and had no openings. The second level was deeper and wider, rounded on the end, and had about four black, vertically rectangular openings or portholes that were wider at the bottom. Other openings were probably cloaked or masked by the cloud. The black openings were the most impressive part of the craft and felt ominous, like windows or observation ports. The third layer was wider still and had no openings that I could see. The bottom of this level, and whatever was below it, was concealed by the bubbling cloud. The craft was immense. I have brainstormed the event and tried to measure the vessel with imaginary football fields. It is at least 300-400 meters across at its widest point, assuming that it is symmetrical. I entered and exited my home twice and can vouch that this thing was there for at least 5 minutes. The second time I left the house, it was gone. For various reasons, I did not take a photograph and kept silent for over two years. I have repeatedly brain-stormed the event in order to flesh out this description and make the most accurate possible drawing.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

At first I thought it was a shooting star.  Then it stopped dead. It became aware that I was observing it.  It shot strait up in an arch fatter than I've ever seen anything move.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
