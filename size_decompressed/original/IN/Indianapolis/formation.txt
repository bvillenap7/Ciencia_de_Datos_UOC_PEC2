Odd formation over Indy around 3 am;2007-06-10 03:00:00;20 seconds;Odd formation over Indy around 3 am I saw a very odd formation of 3 lights traveling at an unnatural rate of speed across the dark sky over Geist Lake.  They were in some kind of triangle but the triangle was unlike any formation that a terrestrial craft would fly in.  It seemed as if they were miles apart.

Triangular formation of reddish amber lights on the northeast side of Indianapolis;2013-07-06 23:40:00;1 minute;Triangular formation of reddish amber lights on the northeast side of Indianapolis As I was driving down a neighborhood street at night to run an errand, I noticed three round reddish amber lights in a triangular formation about 500 feet in the air, moving from south to north.  They appeared strikingly similar to the so-called Phoenix Lights from 1997, although no large, dark triangular object was seen corresponding to the lights.  The lights where about 150 feet apart from one another in formation.  The lights then made a rounded turn and heading west, then two of the lights disappeared.  The remaining light had increased in altitude to about 2,000 feet, then was stationary then dimmed out.  They appeared to be moving a bit too fast to be Chinese lanterns, considering there wasn't really windy out nor storming (partly cloudy evening).   They didn't appear to be manmade aircraft no plane, jet, or helicopter as each object was just one ball of light.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Many white objects in the sky.;2013-09-28 21:00:00;5 minutes;Many white objects in the sky Going from the south to the north many objects to get a count, white in color, going very fast, some faster than others.  Hard to describe.  It looked like it was falling out of the sky from way up.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Three yellow/orange lights over downtown Indy fliying in a slow triangler formation before fading in the semi overcast sky one by one.;2014-06-11 22:45:00;6 minutes;Three yellow/orange lights over downtown Indy fliying in a slow triangler formation before fading in the semi overcast sky one by one. A coworker and I were taking a break in a second floor conference room in the building we both work 2nd shift on tonight 6/11/14!    As we were looking out of one of two very large picture windows in the room facing east directly towards the downtown area of Indy, as we were both looking up at the sky, we were both amazed as we saw three yellow/orange lights, slowly flying right over the downtown area in a triangular formation!   As these lights/objects moved slowly in the sky over downtown Indy after several minutes had past, they each began to fade away in the semi over cast sky one at a time which was very strange to us both!;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Four to five synchronized flashes of white light, moving and circling repeatedly;2014-10-17 20:40:00;15 minutes;Four to five synchronized flashes of white light, moving and circling repeatedly On October 17, 2014, at approx. 8:40 pm, I saw mysterious lights in the sky as I was driving in Indianapolis, Indiana on I465 eastbound between Meridian Street and the I69 exit.  It was cloudy and cool.   These lights were moving in a synchronized fashion, 4 to 5 lights, coming together and then swooping out, circling around, then coming together again.  They would repeat this movement over and over as I traveled eastbound.   They were dim flashes at first, white color, getting slightly brighter as I watched.  The speed that they moved was quick, but not fast or frantic.   I was watching them ahead of me as I drove. They seemed to be moving slightly ahead of me, but not as fast as I was driving.   I exited I465 at the I69 northbound ramp, and couldn't watch them as close, but I saw them briefly when I turned my head to the left.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
15 glowing objects in a strait line disappeared one after another. ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-27 10:14:00;10 seconds;15 glowing objects in a strait line disappeared one after another. They were traveling from east to south very fast. On April 27 around 10PM. I was going on my nightly jog and I couldn't believe what I saw. I noticed a perfect straight line of about 15 stars. I stopped because not only I noticed the line was perfectly straight but the one on the end was red. Suddenly the lights started moving fast in horizontal formation and one by one each object disappeared one right after another until all objects we're gone.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
