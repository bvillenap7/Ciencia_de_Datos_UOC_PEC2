It looked like(size and shape) the HailBop comet but, moving much faster. 12/13/93 @ APROX. TIME 2310HRS. I was standing in front of 3655 Boulevard Place facing West when, I saw a white/green flared light moving rapidly South west out of my field of view.  I listened for impact sound there was none.  Unlike other shooting stars I've seen the flare was wider and had a green hue to it.  Its overall shape was like that of the Hailbop Comet.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
I was walking the dog about 7:10 PM when I saw a Vanilla white fireball moving West to East past the intersection of South Keystone Ave;1999-11-16 19:10:00;10 seconds;I was walking the dog about 7:10 PM when I saw a Vanilla white fireball moving West to East past the intersection of South Keystone Ave. and East National Ave. I was walking the dog at about 7:10 PM when I noticed a Vanilla white fireball right above me traveling from West to East near the intersection of South Keystone Ave. and East National Ave. I would guess that it was only about 1,000 feet above my head and traveling at around 100 mph or more. It changed colors as it passed from Vanilla White to a sky blue. It made a slight whistling sound. It continued to travel didn't fall to the ground. It was already dark here, so the color change was clearly visible. I have never seen anything like it in my life.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
We saw a strange orange fireball four times across the night sky.;2002-05-10 22:00:00;5 seconds;We saw a strange orange fireball four times across the night sky. We were outside at about 10:00 pm. We saw a strange orange fireball fly away from us. It seemed to big to be anything like a meteor and it was flying away from us. It then disappeared suddenly. We shook it off, but then we heard neighbors talking about how the planets are aligned. We became a little interested. We then continued walking around and saw another one exactly the same, fly by across the sky at about 1:00 AM. Later at 2:00 we saw the same thing. At about 4:00 am we saw it fly across the sky again and suddenly vanish. We live near an airport but their is no way this was anything I have seen before. We also heard ,and saw, large (military maybe) jets flying around. We did some research and found no explanation for what this was.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Large Red Orb on Highway;2006-12-24 22:00:00;1 min;Large Red Orb on Highway I was traveling southbound on I-465 sometime between 9 and 10 o'clock, there was a decent amount of traffic at the time.  Suddenly all the vehicles in front of me, most likely about 10 vehicles, came to panic stop as if there was an accident.  Then I saw a bright red orb, almost like the red dot from a laser pointer looks, but this orb was maybe a foot in diameter.  The red orb jumped up from in front of the cars ahead of me, then shifted to side of the highway in front of a sign. Everybody that had been stopped by this red orb speed away very quickly and most exited @the first exit which was Harding Ave.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Flaming object in sky.;2007-07-04 23:00:00;45 seconds;Flaming object in sky It looked like a plane on fire. We all saw it. it was completely unexplainable. We were all (20 of us) sitting on the White River in Indianapolis launching fireworks. It flew over and looked like an open flame flying in the sky. Like a plane on fire. I really became amazed when someone in Connecticut filmed the exact same thing that we saw the night before - July 3rd.  They captured it on film and posted it on Youtube. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we5Zas7SBe0   We saw the EXACT same thing in Indiana on the 4th. ((NUFORC Note:  Video appears to show orange colored, self-luminous objects moving slowly across the sky.  We cannot certify the authenticity of the video, and we do not know what the objects were.

8 UFOs appear as silent orange fireballs in northeast Indianapolis IN;2008-10-25 21:30:00;15 minutes;8 UFOs appear as silent orange fireballs in northeast Indianapolis IN I was on the north side of Indianapolis driving west on 86th street.  At College Avenue,  I saw 4 orange fiery lights in the sky.  The lights were headed north/north east. I turned north on College to follow the lights which were hard to track because of trees.  I turned east on 91st street and pulled into an apartment complex to get out of the car and watch them as I called a friend to come to meet me. The sky was dark.  The UFO’s appeared as orange fireballs and moved in complete silence.  The four fireballs were headed north/northeast toward U.S. 31.  (We were about 80 miles south of Grissom A.F.B.). As soon as the four U.FO.’s were out of sight, I looked back and saw four more come from the same direction.  They were not flying in formation, but all proceeded north/northeast. A friend caught up with me in time to see the last U.F.O. which is he said hovered and lowered and then took off fast enough to disappear before his eyes. I didn’t see the last U.F.O. because a tree was blocking my view.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Orange flaming light rising, then abruptly changing directions and slowly disappearing in the horizon.;2009-10-31 19:00:00;1 minute;orange flaming light rising, then abruptly changing directions and slowly disappearing in the horizon. I was sitting outside my front door when an orange light, flickering as if it were a ball of fire, seemingly rose out of the north. My initial reaction, since it's Halloween night, was that it was a roman candle, It stopped rising then appeared stationary, it slowly moved south then turned abruptly to the east and went at a slow but steady pace, and also started to rise.  It continued in the same direction and same rate of rising until it eventually disappeared in the horizon.  It had just gotten dark but the moon was shining brightly.  There were very few clouds.  The next door neighbor was sitting on her porch and I asked her if she could see it, she looked up and said 'yes'. We didn't discuss it further. Right after it rose and stopped, I opened the door and asked my wife to come and see it, she watched for the duration.  Oddly enough, we had seen (and reported) the exact same thing in the summer of 2008, which as it turned out, had been seen and reported by p! eople throughout Indiana and Michigan.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
More than 7 Red Flaring Orbs in East Indianapolis Sky on 4th of July;2010-07-04 22:00:00;15 minutes;More than 7 Red Flaring Orbs in East Indianapolis Sky on 4th of July Approximately 2200 hours, a group of us on the deck were watching fireworks.  We noticed 3 red fireballs crossing the sky evenly paced.  They got to a certain pointin the sky and then vanished.  At first we believed it to be cloud cover being the reason they vanished but they never reappeared considering their brightness.  Ten minutes after first sighting.  We saw the same shape again coming from the south but a little farther east.  This time one appeared then followed by another then followed by another.  Each one was evenly paced.   After going a distance the first object disappeared, then another came into view.   Each object got to the same point and then disappeared and again another appeared.  This time there was five to six objects. I work for the military and checked with the local helicopter BDE.  It was confirmed that there were no flights that day.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Looked like a fireball floating through the sky, then it seemed to stop, change course and disappear.;2015-09-01 23:45:00;1 minute;Looked like a fireball floating through the sky, then it seemed to stop, change course and disappear. My friend and I were conversing on his front porch, and I was getting up to leave when we saw a strange light traveling through the sky.  He had mentioned earlier that he had been seeing a lot of military helicopters around lately, so we thought at first that it may have been a helicopter.  But it traveled at a constant, relatively slow speed.   As we watched, it appeared to be some kind of fire, and after it reached a certain point in the sky, it seemed to stop.  I thought I saw it move around a little bit, but it could have just been an illusion because it was dark and we were near the downtown lights.  After hovering near the same spot for about 30 seconds, the flame got dimmer and dimmer, and then seemed to disappear or get extinguished. I have never reported a UFO sighting before, and though I do believe they exist, until tonight, I have never been so perplexed as to what I saw and then watched disappear in the sky.   I'm a 29-year-old cell phone salesman, and my friend volunteers at homeless shelters and lives by himself.  He's 23 and has Parkinson's and is unemployed.  He has a military background I'm not fully knowledgeable on, I have never served in the military.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Yellow/orange fireball in Southern sky seen in S. Indianapolis, IN, for 4 minutes in evening of 05 May, 2018.;2018-05-06 22:55:00;4 minutes;Yellow/orange fireball in Southern sky seen in S. Indianapolis, IN, for 4 minutes in evening of 05 May, 2018. On 06 May 2018 at 21:55 EST, I was walking South in the 5200 block of Madison Ave. in Indianapolis, IN. Mildest haze, no clouds, visibility 8 / 10. I saw a yellow/orange ball of light at approximately 15-18 degree elevation in the Southern sky. It appeared to have ignited, burned increasingly brighter for one minute, and slowly extinguish over the next 3 minutes.  It wasn’t visible at 22:00 EST, from my perspective. If the object had the appearance of motion, I would have thought it was a paper lantern. I estimate the distance from 6 miles to infinity.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

First Possible Sighting of UFO: It began to move toward me!;2021-07-27 23:58:00;2 mins;First Possible Sighting of UFO: It began to move toward me! I left work later in the night and decided to spend some downtime in a parks empty parking lot. Close to the time I was about to leave I noticed a ball of reddish/orange light that seemed to be one or two neighborhoods away. It was hard to tell what it was because there was no definite shape at first. I also don’t recall how long it had been there seeing as I had been staring at the sky and my phone for 20 mins at that point. It looked too big to be a star and didn’t move at all. I took a short video to catch it at 11:58pm.  Suddenly it began to lift vertically into the sky very slowly, too slowly to catch on camera with shaky hands but visible to me. I took another short video but again the camera wasn’t good enough. I was trying to be rational but a kinda stubby beam the same color seemed to protrude out very slightly from the bottom. It wasn’t the long white beam I thought I’d see in my first encounter but it was apparent.  The object continued to rise into the sky. I had music playing on my phone at less than half volume so I could still hear a pen drop. No sound was ever heard during any of this encounter. It was silent. Then lights began to blink, about 4 green vertical rectangular lights on the right side, and 4 red ones on the left. I took a third and final video of the blinking lights which only appear slightly in my video at 12:00am. When I zoom into the video it looks similar a sun with five/six hoops moving around it like an atom.  At that point it was a lot higher in the sky and began moving toward me at a rate that continues to send chills down my back hours later. I could tell it was fast because the size of the object increased in less than seconds. I immediately started my car, reversed, and sped off. As I was speeding off i FaceTimed my friend to explain what was happening as quickly as I could. When I was turning out of the park, I took a quick glance- but nothing. The sky was empty. The encounter felt like forever, when I looked at the timestamps I really couldn’t believe it was only about 2 mins.   I’ve never been so shaken up by anything before.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
