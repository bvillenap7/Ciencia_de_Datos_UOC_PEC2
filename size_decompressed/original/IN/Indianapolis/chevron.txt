The event was at right about sunset on 9-21-99. On Tuesday evening 9-21-99,at about 6:45 PM, I was walking through the Country Club apartment complex on the South side of Indianapolis near S. Madison Ave. and E. Troy Ave.. I was facing West just at sunset when I observed what I at first thought was a hawk flying in the West / Southwestern sky. As it moved, it soon became apparent that it was actually a large chevron shape. The object pivoted on its left wing and leveled off It then either shot off faster than my eyes could follow it or it became invisible. I would estimate the size of the craft at between 100 to 150 feet across at about a mile distance at an altitude of approximately 2,000 - 3,000 feet. It appeared to be a solid dark grey or black color. Just as soon as the craft disappeared from my sight, a second object shot just below the point where I had seen the first. It moved so quickly that all I could perceive was a solid black streak. It reminded me of what a hockey puck might look like after being hit as seen at the level of the ice. I couldn't detect any sound or unusual lighting.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Several boomerang shaped craft that started out like a huge bright red/orange ball of light, diminished to an amber glow, then to black;2013-07-03 21:45:00;5 minutes;Several boomerang shaped craft that started out like a huge bright red/orange ball of light, diminished to an amber glow, then to black I got home from work and took my dog out on a leash to the yard and as we were walking around the yard I looked up at the sky as I always do and have for years because I love trying to spot the big dipper and little dipper and seeing the moon and all the stars...  And all of a sudden coming over one of the tall trees I see a huge and very bright orange/red light and it was about as big as the full moon but it was moving my way and from behind it came another and then another, and another, like bullets shooting out and I'm standing there thinking and saying out loud to myself what in the world is this!  I thought maybe weather balloons or hot air balloons, or parachutes.  I just didn't know and still have no idea. I looked around to see if anyone else was out and of course there was no one but me and my little Shit-zu, who could care less and I've never seen anything like it.   There was no sound and as the bright orange/red ball of light traveled it got higher and dimmer until you could finally tell that it was a boomerang shape and the intensity of the color diminished to an amber sort of glow until finally they turned black, but you could still see them flying across the sky, just like you can see a bat in the sky at night.   I saw 3 of them end up flying side by side and I ran to get my camera but by the time I got back outside they were so high and almost gone that they look almost like nothing but a joke, but believe me it's not a joke and these things were something!  You can only see 2 of them from the picture I was able to get and you can see one is more brighter in color than the other because this is how they went in intensity.  I so wish that I would have had my camera on me and been able to take the picture when they first started out because believe me that had my complete and full attention.
