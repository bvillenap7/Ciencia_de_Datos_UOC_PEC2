Crescent-shaped object seen in 1971;1971-09-10 19:00:00;5 min.;Crescent-shaped object seen in 1971 My sighting took place in early or mid-September 1971. I don't remember the exact date. I was taking an evening graduate level chemistry class on the north side of Indianapolis. Class had finished and I was walking through the parking lot to my car. It was about sunset. The sky was clear. Some bright, moving objects in the western sky caught my attention. I remember three objects. Two of them were tracing out a more or less circular path about 180 degrees opposed to each other, as if they were orbiting around a common center and trying to stay as far apart as possible. The third object was moving in its own oval path to the south of the first two. As the objects moved, they would reflect the setting sun, then the reflection would fade and a dark shape could be seen. This is similar to how the sunlight plays off an airliner near sunset, and at first I thought the objects were planes in a holding pattern. However, something that's hard to put my finger on held my attention - something unfamiliar about the shape, or maybe the way the objects seemed to glide or float, different from the way a plane flies. They also didn't seem to bank as they turned. I could hear no sound or see any lights on the objects. As I continued to watch, the third object, the one farthest to the south, started to move east, directly toward me. It passed almost directly overhead and continued east until it was lost in the dusk. As it passed overhead I got a good look at it. The main part of the object was crescent-shaped and seemed to be made of a dull-finished material. It looked dull red as it was overhead. Projecting back from the center of the crescent was a sort of stubby rectangular fuselage that was highly reflective, like polished metal. This was the part that reflected the sun. There was no sign of a tail assembly of any kind or engines. There was no sound, contrails, or lights, nor could I see any windows. I remember the object seeming to be in the size range of an asprin tablet to a dime held at arm's length. It's hard to estimate the object's altitude and true size. As I said, it was about sunset, but due to buildings and trees I couldn't tell if the sun had actually gone below the horizon. My first impression was that the sun was down, and the object was very high to catch its last rays, which meant it had to be huge. If the sun had still not set, the object could have been lower and smaller. As the object went out of sight, the first two objects were still circling in the west. I'd guess the whole observation lasted about five minutes. I don't know if anybody else in the parking lot saw the objects or not, and I was too fixed on observing to call anybody's attention to them. I never reported the incident, only told a few family members. While this is an old sighting, I thought it might be of interest. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in September 1971 is approximate.

A multi-titled, multi-colored possibly foursided pyramid seen before I entered 2nd grade, brother saw same thing years later.;1994-07-01 09:00:00;15 seconds;A multi-titled, multi-colored possibly foursided pyramid seen before I entered 2nd grade, brother saw same thing years later. My parents still tell a story about how when I was about to start 2nd grade during our family prayers I jumped up crying and hid in the closet in the room that me and my sister shared.  I told them that I was afraid to go to 2nd grade when in fact I was scared of what I had just seen out my window.  My bed was right next a large, nearly full wall window that faced our backyard in the room that I shared with my older sister.  My parents sat on the floor and my sister was in her bed and I was in mine. I remember being bored, per usual, and staring out the window when this...pyramid I suppose floated casually past the window.  It wasn't like any of the pyramid's I've looked up online.  I guess those are like black triangles with lights on their corners?  This was covered in little metallic/chrome-ish rectangles that were either silver or lighting up different colors.  I remember pinks and yellows and blues so nearly primary colors, but you could tell they were still metallic silver underneath.  It was weird and seemed to lazily float past.  It didn't seem to be propelled by anything and didn't seem to be in any sort of hurry. Ok and I get it, I was little could have just been my mind messing with me and I can't remember if it was four sided (feel like it was) or three because I only saw it in profile and in my memory it looks like it floated right between my house and the gazebo on our deck which is only about 25 feet or so, so there are clearly some missing pieces.  Also I remember it was completely silent.  The thing that has finally brought this up in my mind again after 15 years is that my brother is a sophomore in college now and lives in my house here and we were talking about random weird stuff that happened in our old house (which was a lot...I don’t know if that relates either) when he told me that when he'd been in about 2nd grade he'd been woken up two nights in a row by multi colored lights outside his window on the 2nd story but facing the street not the yard. He said he didn't see any object making them the 1st night because it'd been so bright but that the 2nd he'd seen a pyramid type object. I'd never told anyone about what I'd seen and neither had he till we had this conversation.  Now we just want to know if there’s anyone else who possibly has seen something like this because after looking it up forever and all over the internet I can’t find anything.

Huge star like objects swooped toward earth at a fast pace.;2000-11-11 19:32:00;2min.;Huge star like objects swooped toward earth at a fast pace. They were like huge stars, came in view closely then retreated then came at an alarming rate directly at me at a 45 degree angle and swooped back into the air and disappeared in a matter of seconds.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

It was above a thin cloud cover and the moon shown on the underside from the reflected light as it was also observed by moonlight of the sides and also backlighted as well. This craft was estimated to be traveling at 4000MPH and was a chunky V shape with a discernible thickness approx. equal to the width of the body legs. It was silent even though it passed directly overhead. The angle of the legs to each other was approx. 45 degrees with blunt ends to the legs. The apparent thickness of the legs-body was  substantially more than our B2. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
The object  was bright and stauled.;2003-11-26 07:00:00;06:00;The object  was bright and stauled. I was leaving home one morning and was traveling for Thanksgiving. After about 5 or 6 minutes on the busy dark highway of I-465 I noticed flashing lights of different colors breaking through the early morning clouds. I first thought it was an airplane but it wasn't moving at all. From beginning to end it wasn't moving. It just dissapeared in a flash from then vanished into the clouds. Another scary thing about this was that it was right above the skyline of Indianapolis. Scary but true.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Gathering of six objects with pulsating red and white lights, no sound, broke into 2 groups of 3 traveling in different directions.;2003-12-25 20:42:00;4 - 6 minutes;Gathering of six objects with pulsating red and white lights, no sound, broke into 2 groups of 3 traveling in different directions. I observed a gathering of 6 red and white pulsating objects that were in a loose formation when I first observed them. There were two outer red lights with a white light in the center of each of the objects. The formation then broke into 2 groups of 3. 3 moved to the west, the other 3 moved to the southeast. From our vantage point from a second story apartment balcony, I would estimate that the objects were approximately (at first) 15 -20 miles to the northwest at an altitude of approx. 5 - 10 thousand feet. The objects appeared to travel at a steady pace somewhat faster than would an airliner. The westward moving objects went out of visual range within about 3 minutes. The three ojbects moving to the southeast passed just to the west of the apartment complex. It also seemed that two of the objects passing over the area where we were were gaining altitude, while the third remained at consistent level. There was no sound that could be heard from the objects. As they were passing above us, I pointed out a high flying airliner to my friend, to compare the difference of the airliner's running lights as compared to the objects. The original formation's exact location would most likely have been about 2 -3 miles northwest of downtown Indianapolis.One interesting point is that while I was in route to the apartment complex, I noticed airliners coming in to the airport on their regular flight paths with what looked to me to be extremely - almost excessive - displays of brilliant collision lights. They were so bright that when I spotted the first one, I wasn't sure if I was actually seeing an in-coming aircraft or a brilliant UFO. This would have been about 30 minutes prior to the sighting of the formation from the balcony. On my way home, at about 9 PM, I couldn't help but noticed that all large in-coming aircraft to Indianapolis International were displaying the same excessive brilliance as the ones that I had seen about an hour before. This causes me to wonder if what we saw from the ! balcony was only the final minutes of an episode that had gone on in the skies above the city for some time. I have seeen UFO's before this incident, and would like to think of myself as a seasoned sky watcher. I have become familiar with aircraft standard night time appearnces and proceedures   in the area. From the points mentioned in the above despription, I would have to say that there was nothing standard regarding the brilliance of the aircraft or the appearance, movement, and formation of the unknown objects.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
silent, V shaped object with reddish-orange glimmering light at the bottom of the V moving NE to SW.;2008-07-04 23:00:00;5 minutes;silent, V shaped object with reddish-orange glimmering light at the bottom of the V moving NE to SW. Flew from the northeast to southwest about 11:00 PM, then turned directly south and made an abrupt turn west. Not a right angle, but a very tight turn. Bright, almost throbbing orange-reddish glimmering light. I was watching TV and noticed the odd light out the window, I went to look, at first thought it was an airplane on fire, my wife and I went outside and watched it for about five minutes as it made it's way from the northeast, turn south then go west. It wasn't moving very fast at all, but steadily progressing. When it made its turn, it was near enough that we would have heard if it was a plane, but there was no sound. Do to the high cloud ceiling, we could also then see the shape against the clouds, looked somewhat like an upright V, the ends pointing upward and the glimmering light at the bottom. And by glimmering, it was kind of throbbing, but with no certain pattern, that's why I first thought it was a plane on fire. The airport is to the west, but it wasn't following the line the planes normally do and passed by to the south of Indianapolis International Airport. I host an internet message board pertaining to automobile racing and I asked if anyone else in the Indy area had seen it. Many people were still outside at the time veiwing fireworks. I had 2 responses on the message board from people in the Indy area that had witnessed the same object and both had the same reaction I had. I work in the insurance industry and my wife is a registered nurse.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Flashing multi-colored lights on a flying object;2013-06-02 23:00:00;1 hour;Flashing multi-colored lights on a flying object The ship looked like a disk or a square with a flat line of lights. it was moving for about 30 min than stop and was hovering in the same spot for about 45 min so far. the lights were red, blue,while, purple ,and green.  All flashing in random order.   I was driving home when i saw this and then the rest of the family came out looking as well as my boyfriend at his house.  there was only one ship that we saw at this time but we were looking at it thru a scope and everything.

10-20 orange dots, 5 feet off the ground, 2 witnesses. Didn't make a exact shape, but vanished after 5 seconds.;2013-06-03 22:20:00;5 seconds;10-20 orange dots, 5 feet off the ground, 2 witnesses.  Didn't make a exact shape, but vanished after 5 seconds. We were pulling up to my house after going to get some things from the Store. As we approached my house i seen what appeared to be multiple orange balls about 5feet off the ground, what i would describable this looks like, would be when your driving and you see someone flick out a cigarette into the street at night, and those orange/red sparks come off of it..  But this was composed of multiple orange circles i believe, but was only between 10-20 small balls/circles.  I was looking at it for about  5 seconds then it just went away, like it vanished. I don't exactly believe in UFO stuff, but i do believe in heaven and hell, and i do believe that this is a trick of the enemy to distract peoples minds and hearts, and it say the devil is the father of the air ways, but i would say all this is fragments of heaven and hell.. At least some of the things, some of it might actually be UFO's, but dont get carried away and forget your maker. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
