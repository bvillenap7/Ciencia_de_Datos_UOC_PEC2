Strange Looking UFO and others;2003-10-15 17:30:00;3:00;Strange Looking UFO and others I was talking with a fellow student at ITT Technical Institute (northwest side of Indy) when she looked up in the southeast sky and said what's that?” I turned to look and seen a craft traveling northwest at a moderate speed. It was about as high as a small plan would fly. Now get this, it looked like a bunch of balloons tied together flying across the sky (sun setting/no lights). The wind was coming out of the northwest the direction it was flying into. We agreed on its appearance, but couldn't understand how balloons could move against the wind current. I drive to school from a town called Kokomo which is 50 miles north of Indy Mon, Wed, and Fri afternoons (night classes). On my trips back home I have been witnessing strange lights in the sky since October to now (Dec). I have seen lights that fade into view move then fade out. I usually drive the country route unless of snow then I take Highway 31. Since the end of this summer I've seen many of these strange lights in the night sky on my return trips from school. I keep forgetting to grab a camera or camcorder, but with work/school I tend to be on the move a lot (not thinking of a camera). I even stop the car to see if it's just my eyes playing tricks on me. Bingo, I see them moving in erratic patterns then fading out of site. I'm just waiting for one to fly over my car and pick me up to take a ride. Hahaha, I'd probably freak and run home with my tail between my legs. I have seen UFOs my whole life, but these are the most sightings I have witnessed in such a short time frame. I noticed some similar sightings on the board in Indiana by others, so I know people are seeing the same UFOs.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Sky Boom possible Sonic Boom;2003-10-19 17:05:00;1 to 3 Seconds;Sky Boom possible Sonic Boom At 5:05pm, Clear Sky. The northeast side of the city was rocked by a Sky boom/Sonic boom. Strong enough to rattle windows, set off car alarms for several blocks and drew people outdoors and scan the skies for source. At 5:10 local Fire Departments rode the streets looking for source. As far as I could judge by scanning the fire and police band radios it was felt and heard up to radius of two miles and center being at the 46 and Emerson Street area. There were no emergency runs or calls.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
hovering light over Avon for 10 minutes sends signal then disappears;2003-11-25 07:20:00;5 mins;hovering light over Avon for 10 minutes sends signal then disappears Saw light for about 10 minutes or so not moving at all. Upon flashing my flash light at it, it seemed to flash back but not in any specific order. I thought for a while it was the top of a distant antenna about a mile away. I turned away to start my work and looked back in less than a minute and it was gone. There were no other lights or planes to be found in the sky, and at dawn in about 20 minutes i was able to see there was no antenna ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

either one huge triangle with lights on each tip or 3 seperate crafts;2004-05-11 23:00:00;5-6 min;either one huge triangle with lights on each tip or 3 seperate crafts I couldn't sleep, so i decieded to go out and walk around the yard with my dog, looked up and  noticed the sky was clear, so i turned out all the outside lights to get a better look.  So i laid down in the bed of our truck and was looking at the big and little dipper in the sky, when i noticed 3 very faint/small stars moving. At first i thought i must be seeing things,  Then i saw that they where deffinatly moving from nw to se  at a very high rate of speed.  As far away as they were i sometimes lost them and i would have to refocus my eyes to see them again. It was either one huge craft with 3 light in the shape of and offset triangle, or 3 seperate crafts flying in perfect formation,  wow  was all i could think;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Ultra-fast fly-by of 2 ufo's with associated light, noise, energy, electrical interference, UV radiation;2006-12-24 02:55:00;15 seconds;Ultra-fast fly-by of 2 ufo's with associated light, noise, energy, electrical interference, UV radiation I swear this account is entirely accurate and 100% honest based on my unforgettable recollection and account made immediately after the event. I would testify to this in a court of law before God. Myself, Philip Burke, and Wesley Jinks, all eagle scouts and college students, witnessed strikingly similar events. I won the poker game and we stepped outside so Phil could smoke a cigarette. Phil was smoking under the porch by the basement sliding door. Wesley was walking back from his car after getting his wallet so he could pay up for his poker loss and was turning the southeast corner of the house when this incident began. I was completely sober because the antibiotics I’m taking react violently with alcohol. It was between 2:55 and 3:00 AM, December 24th, 2006. I was centered on the east edge of my back patio off the basement. I was looking almost directly up at the northeast sky at maybe a 75 degree angle, attempting to look for the stars. It was evenly overcast that night with no rain and very little wind, about 40 degrees F and relatively calm outside. Very low level clouds in even formation meant that no stars could be seen. All three of us encountered two distinct identical waves of energy that streaked the sky with associated noise, light, and perceptible electric and magnetic energy unlike anything we had ever seen, heard or felt in our experience. I consider myself to have a sharp perceptional awareness and to be in touch with my senses. I was once missed by a lightning strike by 10 feet in a rainstorm and felt incredibly jolted, but this experience shocked or jolted me electrically ten times more than this previous lightning incident. I could tell the pulse was also very magnetic in nature, having had an MRI less than two months ago, and several in the past two years. I was mid sentence and went instantly silent when I was frozen by a sudden blast of energy coming from the sky. The blast originated in the west-northwest sky and moved east-southeast, crossing the entire sky from horizon to horizon in maybe two seconds, no idea as to altitude. There was initially no light associated with this blast, only pure energy. I could feel this energy. It coursed through my body. It felt like a concentrated pulse of electric and magnetic energy. This wave of energy that hit my body felt like the rush from jets doing a low altitude fly-by at an air show, only instead of wind, it was a burst of electric and magnetic energy that grew gradually, drastically spiked, then trailed off. As this pulse moved directly over my head it seemed to convey my entire body with it in the direction of its path. It was strongest at this point. I was frozen still in fear and my upper body wavered east-southeast as if I were getting pushed and pulled at the same time, only nothing physically touched me except energy. I moved my foot to keep myself from being pushed over, otherwise I feel as if I would have been knocked down. As this pulse approached, the associated noise quickly turned from a low drone or buzz to a tinny screech that was deafeningly loud for a fraction of a second then returned to a low drone. It was louder than anything I’ve ever heard for that brief fraction of a second when it seemed to pass overhead. I covered my ears but kept my eyes wide open. As this pulse approached and the drone got louder, the sky filled with an ambiance of alternating green and blue waves that seemed to radiate linearly and at short regular intervals out from the path of travel of this pulse. The waves lit the overcast sky more and more brightly during the pulse’s rapid approach, like they were being projected on the clouds from above the cloud ceiling. The brightness approached the brightness of day but everything around me had an eerie blue-green cast. An instant after the noise got unbearable, immediately as it began to subside, the entire sky filled with an array of every color in the visible spectrum for a brief instant, brighter than anything I have ever seen in the atmosphere, including the light of day at high noon. At this point I was facing east, looking up at a 45 degree angle. It seemed as if the pulse just passed. The sky was splotched with every color in the spectrum shining on the clouds in an instant dazzling array, predominately oranges and reds. It seemed as if a 3D electric matrix of visible fine lightning-like electricity filled the sky and approached from the east, went over my head. This matrix of many hundreds of tiny electric bolts, blue green in color, may have entered the lightning rods of my house. This is unclear because my eyes were still recovering from the brightness of the flash. The previous blue green waves mentioned may have lasted two seconds and grown in intensity, but this rainbow colored flash with the electrical matrix lasted maybe a quarter of a second. The power in the house then went off completely with no associated surge or fade. It just cut out then came back on about a second later. ! The neig hbor’s floodlight remained on. All was calm and quiet for a second or two and my fear caused me to begin to turn towards the house to seek cover as I still looked at the sky. I then remembered Wesley was out front and I stayed outside to see if he saw anything. As he was approaching from the southeast corner of the house, maybe 75 feet away, ALL OF WHAT I HAVE RECOLLECTED THUS FAR WAS REPEATED IDENTICALLY, only we were paying closer attention to the sky now, so it seemed more extreme. I’m uncertain whether it was or not. Both sets of pulses, flashes, buzzes, and power outages occurred in maybe ten or twelve seconds total. During the hour following this incident my ears hurt as if I had been at a rock concert that lasted for a week. My eyes hurt like I just walked out of a pitch black cave and stared at the sun. The cable TV and internet did not work until the next day. Once I regained my footing after the first blast, I felt like I was in instant shock, not from disbelief but from the actual energy inside me. I felt like I was filled to the brim with free electrons. My heart rate instantaneously spiked to its maximum and stayed there for quite some time. My body did sort of a hormonal dump, not quite like going into shock, but similar. It felt wonderful and terrible, as I imagine trying crack cocaine for the first time would be. These feelings gradually normalized over the course of two hours. Immediately after we came inside following the second pulse, we all confirmed something very, very weird just happened. I insisted no one speak of it and we all write separate personal accounts. Before we started writing, I ventured back outside and gazed at the sky for a couple minutes to find out if I could see anything else. The once thick cloud cover had opened to a strip of clear sky. This strip of clear sky was bordered by parallel lines of cloud cover on each side. The strip of clear sky appeared exactly where I sensed the two blasts had traveled horizontally through the sky from west northwest to east southeast. It looked as if the strip was opened by parting winds in opposite directions in the atmosphere. It stretched from horizon to horizon. I noticed Phil had dropped a lit cigarette on the ground. As I gathered paper I felt like I was on a mild dose of ten different drugs at once and my heart rate would not move from its peak. Wesley agreed to write an account, but Phil was ghost white and looked like he was about to have a heart attack. He noticed the cable TV signal had been lost (it worked fine before this incident) and opted for bed instead. Wesley and I did not speak to each other at all as we wrote, and only when we both finished did the results appear incredibly similar in every detail. While writing, I tried to relax and slow my racing pulse. As I did this, I experienced a euphoric pain free sensation originating in my spine and neck. I felt like I was five years old physically, except my heart ached like I was 80. As I wrote from maybe 3:10 AM to 4:30 AM this euphoric feeling gradually shifted from my spine to my muscles where I experienced major muscle relaxation. It seemed as if the electricity left me in waves starting at my core that rapidly moved to the surface. Each wave lasted about four seconds, and there must have been hundreds of them. As these hundreds of individual waves of electricity made it to the skin, I would get the strongest goosebumps I’ve ever had and my hair would stand on end, noticeably on my arms. The feeling of muscle relaxation progressed to the point where I collapsed with my arms and chest on the table for about ten minutes where I could not write. I was motionless, simply enjoying the feeling when I was suddenly overcome by a strange migraine centered immediately behind my right ear near the surface of the skin. It was intense and piercing, and caused me to pick myself up, no longer experiencing any positive feeling symptoms. This migraine was very short lived and disappeared completely after only a couple of minutes. I have no history of headaches and have been routinely staying awake until 2-4 AM for about a month straight, so I felt no undue fatigue during any of this whole experience. The headache was enough to convince me I should go to bed. I tried to think about other things and eventually fell asleep. I slept through the night and woke up the next day with a sunburn on my face and hands, with redness and mild pain. My medication makes me very sensitive to UV radiation and I have been avoiding the sun completely. I ate breakfast, but could not keep it down. The cable TV came back on suddenly at about noon. Let me know what you think. THIS WAS THE WEIRDEST OF THE WEIRD.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Ligt streak during a video on Sunday night football.;2010-09-19 20:40:00;1 sec;Ligt streak during a video on Sunday night football. On tonight's NFL Sunday Night game at approximately 8:40pm eastern, there was a streak of light during a live shot of downtown Indianapolis. There was an ad box in the middle of the screen. They had just switched from southwest airlines to Hyundai.  The streak started on the top dead center of the screen and moved towards the right in a curve towards a building with 2 blue light stripes on it.  It disappeared momentarily and reappeared for an instant moving horizontally. I did happen to DVR the event and reviewed it. it's just a light with no discernable features but didn't look natural.  I'm sure you could get the video image from NBC. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
5-6 amber colored lights flying in formation.;2011-06-14 00:10:00;1 minute;5-6 amber colored lights flying in formation. While driving home from work, from Bloomington to Indianapolis, I noticed 5 to 6 individual amber colored lights in formation.  As they passed my car, the formation was maintained, but it wasn't a formation that is consistent to the military as it was very lose and not in line. The route I take from work is State Route 37 (northbound).  Normally on my return trip home there are aircraft on the left (west) side of the road flying the approach pattern into the Indianapolis International Airport (KIND).  As a private pilot, I am very aware of the orientation of the lights on aircraft.  This was unlike anything I have ever seen. Before the sighting, I noticed what appeared to be a shooting star going to the right, or east side, of the road.  Whether this has any connection to the sighting or not is unclear.  After driving for about 2-4 minutes I noticed the lights through the trees on the same side of the road as the shooting star.   Thinking that it look rather odd, I continued looking in the direction until I passed by a field where there was a clearing in the trees. I was about 10-15 miles from the city at this time. At that point, I could clearly see that there were 5-6 amber colored lights, almost in a Z formation.  I tried to take a picture with my cell phone camera but the lights were too faint to show up.  They appeared to be traveling southbound and I could not tell at what altitude, as there was no prospective on what I was seeing.   As they passed to the right of me, each light faded from the first to last and I couldn't see them anymore.  As I was looking, I noticed there was a cloud that was illuminated by the moon so i kept watch until I spotted them again.  They were no longer emitting any light, but I could see specks in contrast to the illuminated cloud.  They were not connected in any way, and were independant of each other. After realizing what i had seen, and the close relationship with landing aircraft, I did contact the TSA office at KIND.  They said that there had been no reports of anything that I was describing and that it would be noted.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Large falling object that doesn't make a sound.;2012-09-05 22:30:00;4 seconds;Large falling object that doesn't make a sound. Last night at around 22:30 I had been sitting out with my neighbors (4 of us) having a couple of drinks. I just happened to face north when I saw a large object flash. It was coming down at a very fast rate. For a second I thought it was an airplane because it seemed so large and we do live near the airport. I exclaimed to my friends to observe the object, I really thought it could be a plane crashing. By the time they turned to face the object, it had already disappeared behind one of the houses. I was scared, and they could tell I was scared. I don’t think anyone else saw it, someone said it could have been a shooting star. I think it was too large to be a shooting star. The object came by and went too fast for me to determine how far away it was. The object looked about the size of an airplane when it is closing in for landing. The flash I saw from it was white in color, but there seemed to be flames coming from behind it as it fell down, also white in color. I never heard a crash or anything of the sort and part of the reason I got scared was because I was expecting some sort of noise. I was thinking it could have been a meteor or space junk, but I was unsure if those would make a noise since the object I saw seemed so close and large. Bottom line is I don’t know what it was and was wondering if anyone else had seen it.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
NOTE-This is based on what actually happened.

The UFO explained, however, is real and the way it was seen is not changed in any way.  I was out looking at the moon at this time, due to the fact that it was unusually shiny.   While I was out, I saw this odd thing in the night sky, with 2 different colored blinking lights. Every time I went to a different location, the craft was still following me, staying still when I didn't move.  I put on some glasses, looked closer, and realized that it wasn't just a single star (there weren't any stars), but rather an actual spacecraft, with a red light on bottom and a green bluish one on top.  It looked unusual, but kind of ovalish with 2 tiny things on its dies.   It couldn't have been a plane, for they can't be totally still, and jets couldn't possibly stop or they would stall and crash. I am a creative person, and very intelligent.  It took some hours for me to come to this conclusion, and I can't really think of what else to say about this.

I've never seen a UFO or any flying object like this.   My husband was the driver who first pointed it out to me.  It was kind of the shape of a cigar so I thought it was a plane until it got closer.  It was changing lights from red to yellow and flying in a way no airplane could fly.   Then suddenly it was moving so fast I was shocked.  The lights stopped blinking then it continued to remain one flash of light and I saw one behind it!!  It was following the first one I saw.   I never believed i would see something like this.   The location was on the east side of Indianapolis.   After they faded we also saw two of the similar objects by our home doing the same thing.  I can't be fore sure if they were the same crafts or not.  It was just very bizarre.  I'm in shock if no one else has reported or seen these.

I was driving out of the Indianapolis airport tonight and saw what I thought was a plane coming in.  The odd thing was that this craft had an unusual configuration of lights.  I kept looking up at it when it appeared to stop and hovered.  Then a bunch of lights came on and started to 'strobe'  Lights were quickly flashing on and off.  This lasted for about 5 seconds then everything went dark and I could no longer see it.  I was alone when this happened.  I did notice that the other cars in front of me had put on their brakes and slowed while this was happening.  I cannot imagine what kind of craft would do this.

We are in a flight path but this seemed to be not the usual airplane engine noise.  It continued for at least five minutes, and I finally went out in my pjs and stood on the driveway at the back of our cul de sac.   The sky was whited out and nothing could be seen visibly in the sky.  The sound, however, was like massive engines that had tones (f and g above middle c, half note measures) and underneath those tones was a low infrasound engine tone that sounded like low heavy steady wind.  It was Extremely loud and ongoing and I kept wondering why no one else had come out of their homes to see what the source was.  The Only thing I could come up with is perhaps it was a Massive cloaked mothership and or a fleet of same, flying low and slow.   It kept up for at least 20 minutes and then finally started fading off and I could hear it in the distance, it seemed to be heading southwest as far as distance sound.  I'm wondering if perhaps other have heard this.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
