I happened to look up when an apparently large object seemed to hover overhead.  It looked like a strobe light on an airplane in much larger proportion.  It only lasted about 2 to 3 seconds.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Unsual Flashes During Space Shuttle International Space Station Passing.;2002-10-16 19:00:00;5 minutes;Unsual Flashes During Space Shuttle International Space Station Passing. Wittnesses: 2, with 10x30 and 16x32 Binoculars Duration: 1-3 seconds, two flashes or explosions 65 degrees off North. Horizon. Direct North Horizon being 12 o clock, flashes occured at 1 o clock position and remained stationary. Sky Condition: Slight High Clouds. While waiting to observe the passing of International Space Station and the Shuttle pass over Indianapolis at 7:04pm EST traveling NW to SE. My Wittness and I observed a single bright white flash in the NE sky at 7:00pm. The flash being brighter then any brightest star in sky (approx size 1/4th a inch in size if holding a ruler at arms length), strong enough to cast shadow as we stood scanning the sky for the Shuttle/Station. We immediately trained binoculars on the area of the sky believing it to be the shuttle/station. Then at 7:03pm observed a second flash in same location, scanning the area again with binoculars unable to see an origin of the flash. We were convinced that the flashes were the reflection of shuttle/station an were about to return indoors disapointed. Juat then at 7:05pm The Shuttle and Station appeared in the NW sky between the 9 o clock 10 o clock positon NW sky and proceeded across the sky to the SE. (Which by the way was a fantastic sight to behold). Being that both of us are star gazers and pretty familar with the skys, we are unable to explain these two flashs or their possible origin. They were both 1-3 seconds in duration, and faded out instead of winking out.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Driving on I-74 eastbound toward Indianapolis at approx. 1125 pm EST when upon looking south toward the moon I saw two flashes approx. 5 mins apart just left of the moon.  I'm a meteorologist with the NWS so I immediately thought it looked much like sheet lightning from a storm too distant to see.  However, no storms/clds in the state with high pressure dominant.  The flashes were only 1-2 secs in duration and yellow/pink in color.  Very strange and I would have thought nothing of it except that there was no thunderstorm activity or any wx in the region.  Strange...;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Two intense flashes of light that looked liked transformers blowing.;2015-01-08 19:50:00;3 seconds;Two intense flashes of light that looked liked transformers blowing. I am a local Indiana Truck Driver.  I and a co-worker who is our company's safety officer were driving south bound on I-465 at, or around, mile marker 43, when we both saw an intense flash of light at the horizon line that looked to be no more then 300 meters ahead of us.  We saw two flashes, and brake lights were everywhere on the freeway at the time.  My passenger and I thought it was a transformer that blew, or some massive electrical issue with the power lines, but once we got to where we thought we could see the flashes coming from, there was no sign of any power outage.  It was very peculiar.  Two very intense flashes of light that resembled balls of electricity.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Bright beam of light from ground up, then rumbling passing over the house for around 10-15 minutes, making the house shake.;2015-06-25 05:30:00;10 minutes;bright beam of light from ground up, then rumbling passing over the house for around 10-15 minutes, making the house shake. At somewhere between 5am and 6am, I heard a really loud noise that at first I thought was an airplane, although there are no airplanes that come anywhere near here after the evening.  This noise was pretty low sounding and sounded almost like a bulldozer going over the house, shaking it.  There was also a really bright beam of light that lit up the whole wall in one of the bedrooms, which has blackout curtains.  This didn't sound like thunder, and it wasn't lightning.  Plus, we've lived in this house for about eleven years now and no bright light like that has come in.  The noise woke everybody in the house up, and one of us actually thought that something had hit the house.  The bright light came from the ground, up.  Behind the house is a big field, small woods behind that, and a large golf course.  Not sure if any of the neighbors saw or heard it because this was around a time that most people are asleep.  I'd love to know if anybody else saw it, or what it could possibly be... It lasted about 10-15 minutes. No idea if there was any missing time or anything, but there are 5 witnesses.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Bright green blinking light rapidly crossed the sky,;2020-05-26 22:32:00;90 seconds;Bright green blinking light rapidly crossed the sky, Four adults (2 with PhDs, one in a scientific field) simultaneously observed a rapidly moving green pulsing light moving across the sky almost directly overhead. The speed of the flashing green light was 4-5x faster than the commercial aircraft on far-approach to KIND (Indianapolis International Airport) flying directly overhead just minutes before.  After one adult in the group asked what is that? the blinking immediatly changed from once per second to once every three seconds, but the course (roughly southeast, across Franklin Township, Marion County) remained constant, as did speed. The object moved from Northwest to Southeast across the entire visible night sky in about 90 seconds.  It was far too bright to be a meteor or satellite (it was blinking brighter than the commercial aircraft at 2k-4k altitude), and was moving far too fast to be an aircraft.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
