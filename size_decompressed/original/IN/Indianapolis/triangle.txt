Seen but did not hear it aproaching from about half a mile away,it proceded to get within 200 feet at about 75 feet off the ground with no noise what soever.It was triangular in shape,dark grey or black in color,with a light on each of it's three tips.It was probably only going 20 mph.Once it got as close it was going to get,it stopped and just hung there in mid air and no noise was present.It stayed there for about 20 seconds or so,then with no noise it proceded to go in a strait line probably at a 45 degree angle towards the horizen,due south.And without slowing down,it shot out at a 90 degree angle at a super fast rate of speed and just plain dissapeared,no noise while this was going on.Me and my buddy were at the end of our street playing when we seen this sighting,we were 14 years old at the time.

There were a few people around, but I don't think they were paying attention.  I looked up in the sky, waiting for my mom to pick me up, and saw three sets of points of light.  Each set was in a perfect triangle, and then the three sets of lights were also in a perfect triangle.  The lights were moving at a moderate pace, neither real fast or real slowly.  When I got home, I saw something on the news that night about whether there was a UFO or not, but I wasn't allowed to stay up to watch it, so I never found out what it was.

UFO chased me;2000-04-02 02:00:00;2 minutes;UFO chased me I saw a Triangular shaped UFO in Mars Hill at 2am. It was hovering at treetop level over a stopsign. I stopped my car when I realized what I was looking at. The UFO seemed to be moving away from me and it stopped also. At this point I panicked, I threw my car into reverse and started backwards flooring it. The UFO starts backwards. Accelerating faster then my car. I flipped off my headlights hoping they wouldnt see me. The car engine then dies when the UFO gets within maybe 20-30 feet in front of me still coming at me. I put my car in park and realized I was the only person out on the road and I was about to get abducted. So I knew I had to wake people up not so much to witness the UFO but to stop the aliens from abducting me. I jumped out of my car and started running down the road away from the UFO screaming the entire time. Luckily] some people in a nearby house heard my screams and ran outside. The UFO had drifted over behind a tree so they couldnt see it, but they did see its lights. Then the lights blinked out and it was gone. I got back in my car and it started right up and I drove home.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Triangular UFO, with protruding windows, over a field in Indiana;2000-07-01 03:00:00;>1 minute;Triangular UFO, with protruding windows, over a field in Indiana One thing I use to love doing was taking drives at night.  One evening back in 2000, I decided to go for a drive it was about 3:00 am.  Everything was fine.  It was a nice night out and I had the windows down on my car. I decided it was time to head home so I turned down 25th Street, just off of German Church Road. I passed over a small bridge when I saw a triangular-shaped object hovering over a small field.  From the car I could tell there were three dome-shaped windows on two sides of the object and another one off the bottom of the craft.  Lights were on inside. There was a small farm house between me and the UFO so I decided to go just past the house to get a better look.  When I got to where I should have been able to see it better, it was gone.  I didn't see it leave. I didn't see it disappear it was just gone.   I spent the next minute or two looking around for it, but it was nowhere to be found. A few days, maybe weeks, later as I was watching TV, there was a show (Unsolved Mysteries) that was doing an episode on UFOs.  During this telecast I saw, for the first time, mention of the same craft as I had seen just days before.  It was then that I knew it was real.

6/24/05:  5 lights forming a triangular shape in Indianapolis on Meridian Street;2005-06-24 22:00:00;20 sec-?;6/24/05:  5 lights forming a triangular shape in Indianapolis on Meridian Street As driving North of Meridian Street somewhere between 20th and 30th street, my friend and I saw lights that formed a trinagle directly above us. The amount of lights were 5. The object was hovering at a stagnant nature about 70- 80 feet above the street. The lights seemed to be 10 feet in diametar (all the same size) considering the distance we observed it from. Becasue there was no sound admitted from the craft we knew that it was not any flying object we were familiar with. We were not too far from the center of the city, so we assume that many others saw it. We now regret that we didn't stop the car to observe the craft for a longer amount of time. If anyone else has seen this, please post a report. Thank you.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

We where on Madison Ave heading north.   My Grandson and I notice what we thought was a helicopter flying low at the intersection of Stop 11 and Madison Ave.  I told my Grandson that it was flying to low, and maybe it was a police helicopter looking for some one.  As I drove closer I notice one yellow and two white lights at which the white lights where  going on and off.  The yellow light stayed on.   As we got closer we could tell it was not a helicopter, and it was hovering above Stop 11 and Madison Ave.  I pulled into Egg Roll King Restaurant and stop my car to take a look, my Grandson got out of the car, I stay in the car.  It wasn't a plane or helicopter.  Both of us could see the bottom clearly.  The bottom looked like a triangle shape, I could see metal beams two on each side of the triangle.  I could not see the top, cause we where underneath the object.  The only lights we seen where on the bottom of the triangle.  The white lights we going off intermittently as the yellow stayed on.  I could see the outline above the triangle of the object.  It appeared to be somewhat oval shaped, and what I mean by that there where two spots where it protruded out and it equal in shape, opposite each other.  The color of the object was metallic, the triangle beams where of a black color.  We watched this object from one 1-2 minutes, then it started to move to the south slowly, then to the west.  We got back into the car and followed it for about half and hour, it want faster then higher and higher then disappeared.  I never in my whole life seen anything like it.  There also was no sound coming from it. I am also sending a picture, it's not the best drawing, but it it close to what we saw.  Thank you;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Multiple Triangle shaped UFO's in V formation, then slowly follow interstate in Indianapolis;2008-01-04 00:00:00;1 hour?;Multiple Triangle shaped UFO's in V formation, then slowly follow interstate in Indianapolis On the morning of January 4th, 2008, just after midnight, my Fiancée and I were driving east on E 96th street in Indianapolis, IN. As we approached Indianapolis Metropolitan Airport&#8206 (a small Cessna airfield and flight school) to our north west, I noticed about 6 bright yellowish/white lights in a V pattern only it looked more like a “check” because the last top-left area was not lit. I’m familiar with “Lights over Phoenix” and I called my good friend who is quite skeptical of the famous video. At this point, I assumed I was looking at a couple Cessnas doing night training, but I wanted to call my friend and tell him what I was seeing just for fun. While I was on the phone with him, my Fiancée pointed out that there was a 7th light now in the sky next to them- and much to my surprise, I looked up to see the 7th light duplicate to reveal an 8th light, which instantly glided into position, turning the “check” into a “V.”  Two minutes into the event, as we neared the small airport, it became evident that the lights were not tiny Cessna aircrafts. We could now also make out that each ball of light was in fact three large white lights, as if a commercial airliner had a large spherical light on the bottom-front of the plane and one large spherical light on each wing tip. About another 30 seconds passed and the “V” shape broke up and each aircraft began to pass over head. At a stop light, I opened my car door and stepped out to get a better look at these “planes.” It was when one was right over head that I noticed a tiny red beacon in the very center of the aircraft that was blinking. There were no stars in the sky, and I cannot 100% fully verify that the triangle shaped craft was connected all the way around- but for whatever reason, despite never seeing a photo of one, I just assumed it was triangle shaped. It’s like I could make out the darker matter. I couldn’t make out wings or anything, but my mind saw it as a triangle.  My fiancée asked me what was going on, and I told my friend I would call him back. I told her I thought the planes were actually “UFO’s” because at that point I had no idea what they were and I wanted to scare her. They were large, triangular shaped crafts who made no noise as they passed overhead. I’ll reiterate that it was midnight on a deserted street and literally no noise could be heard. I turned into an apartment complex and physically got out of my car and attempted to take a picture with my phone. My hand couldn’t stay still and with the VGA resolution I snapped a blurred picture that looked more like headlights than anything else. I deleted it when I got home (before I realized the significance of our encounter.)  Because I couldn’t bring myself to fathom alien crafts, and my fiancée didn't appreciate me trying to freak her out, I just assumed I was witnessing some new airliner which I’d never seen before and began to drive home. I took I-69 south and noticed one of the aircrafts following the highway. This struck me as extremely odd because I’ve lived in Indy for quite a while and never before had I seen a low flying airliner simply “follow” the highway. It passed overhead and I saw a few more off in the distance. It was actually really eerie. I’d never felt like that before.  I got home and Googled whether or not Indianapolis International had any delays or runways out, explaining why so many aircrafts were simply cruising around the city at low altitudes at midnight. Literally every flight was on time. That’s the last I thought about this event until today when I stumbled upon a website describing these triangle shaped UFO’s with three white lights and a center red beacon. I noticed how they mentioned these crafts fly low over populated areas, and even follow highways. When I read that line I literally got chills. I’m not going on record saying I witnessed alien crafts, but I will stand by my report that I saw exactly what all of these websites are describing as “triangle shaped UFOs.” The physical description and behaviors mimic exactly as what I witnessed. I felt that I had an obligation to tell somebody or some organization that I witnessed a number of these crafts. I’d sure like to know what they were. I’d draw you a picture but it would look exactly like the dozens out on the web right now, except the center red light was about a quarter of the size as the three white lights. Well, that’s that.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
U/ V shaped gray object. Smaller sphere shaped object near it, no lights or sounds on either.;2008-11-01 19:15:00;unsure;U/ V shaped gray object. Smaller sphere shaped object near it, no lights or sounds on either. We were heading south on the road, and saw a few people standing in their yard looking up at the sky, a couple houses down we noticed another family looking high in the sky with binoculars. We looked up and saw what they were looking at as we pulled off the road. High in the Southern sky the left and above of the moon was a very clear u/v -shaped object. It appeared to be gray.  Below it a small distance was a smaller object, it was not as clear, it was more of a sphere shape but I cannot be sure on that. We did NOT see any lights or sounds. The v- shaped object was very high and small in the sky but still had a very distinct shape. It didn't not move at all although my husband said he thought it might have been rotating horizontally. We watched for about 10 minutes with no change, This was at sunset We scanned the sky to see if there were anymore around, after that we lost them. We did not see them fly away, they were just gone. We have been trying to figure out if anyone else has reported this besides the people who were near us tonight. We have never seen a UFO and are no sure what to think about it or how to find out if there is any information about this sighting.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

I told her i don't know if i should make a wish or what. Well we traveled to 86th and Hague Rd back to my house and then to the southside on the interstate. All this time this star is getting closer as we head south. We were about 1/4 mile from the Raymond exit when we noticed this star was moving toward the interstate. My friend was like is that a round thing, i said OMG what is that. There were other cars on the highway that night but i don't know how to find them to see if they saw the same thing. It dissappeared. Were looking out of the windows and was like where did it go. We then both kinda looked out the whinshield window and it was just hoovering over us with no sound. we saw a rediculous amount of lights. We were so scared, we had never seen anything like this before. I just want to know what they are or were. No one believes us, i feel so crazy right now. Can anyone let me know if they saw the same thing or was my mind playing tricks on me. We saw quite a few of them that night the whole thing had to last for about 2 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours. we sat over a relitives house on the southside for about 2 hours and came back to my house on the eastside and saw another one.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
wings up trianglur shaped craft moving faster than any jet and No flapping like a birds wings;2009-04-06 18:10:00;7 seconds;Wings up trianglur shaped craft moving faster than any jet and No flapping like a birds wings At about 6:00 to 6:15pm EST, in Indianapolis, around 82nd street just off 465 Northbound and 69 N, from the Community North Hospital location, a craft coming Eastbound from the North sky portion, just after the sun peeked brightly from the clouds, it exposed a stealth moving craft with WINGS UP!!!, not moving, NO Bird ever moved that fast, let alone an aircraft, nor (military) fly in a COMMERCIAL ZONE for passenger craft (small or the size of 727, 747, etc). This is a very commonly flown zone for passenger aircraft each half hour and then some. There is a small craft airport in Fishers, less than 2 miles from the area and this craft came from the uppermost part of the clouds, without wings DOWN and no noise, and no flapping as a bird. Neither was it the same as fighter jets with wide wings. It clearly looked liked a craft with the wings UP like on a navy shipped when they docked on the aircraft carrier. It was more than odd, it was not from this world. This particular craft came out of the clouds, approached toward my area directly downward and then veered oddly somewhat southbound on a dime, with absolutely NO movement from the UPWARD CLOSED wings. The wings were like a bird but stayed locked upward still. It then did a 360 motion (turn)  in FULL VIEW with a second, while still moving back into the clouds, upward like a helicopter’s movements, without hesitation and clearly like no craft this world has or any I know of, 3-4 miles from it previous location in SECONDS. This was spotted by two individuals who did not know each other.  The other person saw it like me and slowed their driving from the hospital in awe, but moved on. I told my wife,  but I had no other witness before she came out of the hospital clinic area for allergies. It was awesome and yet fearful as this didn't look friendly but more of a probing observation. My heart was beating so fast, my mouth went dry and I couldn’t talk.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Right after working at a concert, my brother-in-law and sister were driving home with me in the back of the car.  We were driving past firehouse number 20, and a Kroger.  And, I seen a thing in the sky that I was just watching.  And, when it went above us and past the clouds, it looked like a black triangle with 3 lights, like nothing I have ever seen.  Two of the lights were white and one was red, and it looked to be moving pretty quickly.  Then we drove past it, and it was back in the clouds again going to the left... with firehouse 20 and kroger to the right.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
It was one craft with white lights going very slow, then stopped, then the craft went back the way it came 3x it's original speed.;2011-10-08 20:15:00;About 2-4 mins;It was one craft with white lights going very slow, then stopped, then the craft went back the way it came 3x it's original speed. The location of this sighting was at Ben Davis High School in Indianapolis, IN.  But i live in Brownsburg, IN. I was there for a marching band competition, and I was facing east, and the object was heading to my left. My friend which was standing next to me also saw the object.  I saw the object for maybe 2-4 minutes, and the time was between 8pm-8:30pm.   The craft seemed large, and it was maybe a mile or so from where i was. I only saw the lights of the craft, I never saw any body to it.  The lights on the craft, which were white and there was two lights which did not change color.  The lights were close to each other, and appeared to be just a straight line. It was about maybe at a 40-45 degree angle from where I was standing. The reason I was watching this was because it was moving pretty slow, slower than a man made aircraft, and the lights were not blinking like planes, helicopters, etc usually have.  The lights also seemed like they were flickering a little ! at times but neither light was ever turned off.  It traveled east and it stopped after slowing down slightly, then stayed in the same spot maybe 3-5 seconds, then the lights became a little brighter.   After that without turning around it went the way from which it came, and now i could see a third white non-blinking light which was the same size and color as the other two. These three lights made a triangular shape. After starting back from the way it came, the craft was going maybe two to three times it's original speed. My view was blocked by a tree in the distance, about a minute after it starting going back from the way it came.  Then after that my view was blocked because of buildings and trees etc in the distance. I do not know if there were any noises or anything because there were bands practicing around us, and lots of people talking. I did not see it again after that for the rest of the night. P.S. Please, if an investigator calls me, I cannot accept calls during school hours, which is 7:50 am-2:50pm.  Any other time on a weekday after 3pm, except Tuesdays and Thursdays between 6:30-9pm which I have marching band practice.  Or after noon on Sundays would be fine to call. I am busy with marching band on saturdays until the season is over in a couple weeks. I also could communicate through e-mail.  ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this young witness, and he sounded to us to be a quite sober-minded young man.

I was at the traffic lights at the intersection of 96th street and Keystone Avenue, facing east. I spotted ten or twelve triangular shaped objects with bright amber/orange lights, flying at the low altitude and slow speed.  There were a lot of other cars waiting at the traffic light, and this sight was not something subtle or difficult to see.  It was very clear and visible, so I’m thinking there are other people who witnessed this event.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I was so baffled by what I’ve been seeing, therefore I  completely forgot about taking photographs of it.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Triangular craft with two blue white strobing lights over Indianapolis;2012-09-19 21:00:00;2-4 minutes;Triangular craft with two blue white strobing lights over Indianapolis I was traveling home from Muncie, Indiana to Lafayette, IN, returning home from work out of town.  I had just gotten onto 465 W from 69 S.  I watched a triangular shaped craft shoot southbound in the sky across 465. The craft moved much faster than an airplane, and even faster thatn jets I have seen in air shows.  It stopped abruptly in the sky over the north side of 465.  The craft stayed stationary for at least two minutes, until it left my field of vision (in a hurry to get home).  The craft had two white blue blinking lights, very similar to the light you see coming from a satellite. This craft obviously was not an airplane, as it was too fast and the lights were blinking in an erratic pattern.  The two lights were not coordinated in their blinking.  I felt compelled to watch the blinking of lights, even though I was driving.   After about two minutes of watching I started to feel dizzy and disoriented. This report is being filed two days after the fact.  Typically I would not mention something like this. However I can't seem to get this strange blinking or the image of the craft out of my mind.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

They hovered close together for a couple minutes and then the right one quickly shot up diagonally before flying directly overhead, maybe towards Whitestown. The second plane continued to hover before following the same path, and was shortly followed by a third.  They were triangular, military aircraft and were near silent as they flew low overhead. It was very strange and seemed to be a purposeful flight, they weren't just passing by.
