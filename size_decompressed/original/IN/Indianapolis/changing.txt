Alot of air trafic is going on this day.Blimps ,old planes. etc.I saw a comm. jet and then a strange shape above it. No wings could be seen,but it was moving as fast as the jet in a cross pattern.It then seemed to tumble or twist as it moved apearing to change shapes.Also a faint circle appeared around it.Everyone there witnessed the same things.It moved northeast as fast as a jet.(oppisite jet stream) The clouds had just cleared after a brief afternoon shower. Some clouds still remained but they were more of a high cirus type.The object was almost black in color, and at first seemed to be a large egg.I grew up around airplanes,my brother was an airforce pilot witch we would go see often as I was growing up. So I like to think of my self a semi pro spotter and identifer.Many military planes fly around this area so I show off and tell people what they are easily.I said look theres a Stealth,no what the hell is that!!!  We all saw this shape then tumble or turn so that a single point became clear then gone ,then it was there then it wasnt.It moved to fast to be a balloon and it was heading into the jet stream and the wind.   I KNOW WHAT I SAW  BUT I DONT KNOW WHAT I SAW!!! This object was unidentifiable to anny of us.No one knew exactly what to do or say.The only thing that makes me doubt my siting is that it never changed course.  Iwish it did then I would be sure.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

A group of bright blue and neon orange orbs floated over my house.  They seemed to be at least 15,000 feet up.  They were blowing around in the upper wind and seem to morph positions.   The orange orbs or globes seem to glow and all of the blue and orange things seemed to change positions in the group.  It could have been balloons released or something else but their color was very vivid.   The orange orbs would suddenly appear to be blue and visa versa.  Very weird.

Large gray stingray shaped object chases fighter plane.;2014-04-11 22:45:00;20 seconds;Large gray stingray shaped object chases fighter plane. I was on the grocery store parking lot placing my groceries in the trunk.  I heard a fighter plane type sound approaching us but didn't see anything.  About 3 seconds later I see a fighter plane coming from the west heading northeast. The fighter plane was traveling very low and very slow.  If I had to guess I would say 2,000 feet in altitude.  I told my son and my friend look it's a fighter plane.  We watched it for about 8 seconds as it flied by directly above us.  Then a large gray object approached the fighter plane from the rear at a very fast speed.  The object had no navigation lights like the fighter jet had. It only had 4 very dim bar lights between the main body and the wings.  I thought it was going to crash into the fighter plane.  It slowed down suddenly about 3 plane lengths away behind the fighter plane. It followed the plane for about 5 seconds.  Then the object gained speed, made a hard right, and then a hard left, cutting off the fighter plane.   The object could be seen more clearly when it turned because it banked left. Then you could tell that the object was shaped like a stingray without a tail.  It was gray and about 12 times larger than the fighter plane. 4 dim bar lights on each side where the wings joined the main body.  The wings were not fixed.  The wings rippled at opposite rhythm like a stingray.  The object took off heading northwest very fast.  The fighter plane gained speed and continued northeast.  2 seconds later another fighter plane coming from the west followed the path as the first plane but traveled at a faster speed.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
5 sets of lights fly into the clouds and turn into or return to 5 large black soundless a/c. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is USAF vet.  PD));2014-05-29 21:30:00;10 minutes;5 sets of lights fly into the clouds and turn into or return to 5 large black soundless aircrafts I observed two sets of lights in the sky in an area where commercial aircraft fly near my house to approach the Indianapolis airport for landings.   The lights were flying side by side with some distance in between them.  They were traveling at a low speed and I thought they were possibly helicopters, however there was no engine noise.   I noticed that there was more distance between the two sets of lights.   At that point I noticed that one set of lights was climbing upward.  I watched the ascending set of lights climb through a cloud until it vanished from my view.   Then I saw a very large black circular and triangular shaped aircraft emerge from behind the clouds floating very slowly.  The craft started descending and changed into a baloon like shape.   I saw a total of five sets of lights and all five flew the exact same pattern and did the same thing.  I did not see where they went or landed.  I am a 66 year old Air Force Veteran and I have never seen anything like this.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Gravity-Defying Orbs in Triangle Shape.;2019-02-20 00:13:00;30 seconds;Gravity-Defying Orbs in Triangle Shape On the night of February 20th, my wife and I decided to step outside to take in the beautifully serene property of our recently purchased home.  Immediately upon stepping onto the back porch, we both looked up to see what we thought was a spotlight, even though where we live made that impossible.  I quickly stated that it must be the moon, while my wife directed my attention to the moon behind me, clearing up that mix up.   As we began to try and get a better look at the lights, a clear shape took form, there were 3 GIANT white orbs in a perfect triangular shape.  When I say GIANT, I truly mean that this craft (if one solid unit) must have been the size of a football field.  I work in an industry that allows me to make fairly accurate scale analysis in a moments notice and my brain simply could not process the shear scale of the craft(s).  I jumped up onto the bench on our back patio to peer over the roof top to see where it was moving and it appeared to be complet! ely silent and heading East towards Geist Reservoir.  Just as my wife joined me standing on the porch bench, it became very clear that this was not of earthly origin....the triangle shaped craft quickly split into three orbs that shot in all different directions, breaking the laws of physics that we live by.  And just like that, it was gone. I have lived with this unsettling event now for 2-1/2 months and still do not know how to process what I saw.  I steadfastly believe that this planet has been visited by ETs at some point in the history of mankind, but to see something with your own eyes, and know that there are millions others like me....itâ€™s earth shattering.   I decided to share this information in the event it may help connect the dots to a bigger story, or at least preserve this event somewhere that it will not fall on deaf ears.   I pray almost nightly now, having never been a religious man...I pray that whatever that was will come back so I can try to rationalize what I saw.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
