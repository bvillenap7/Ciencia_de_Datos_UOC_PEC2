Very bright green light without sound moved over me and my car from a wooded area about a 1000 ft. up.;1980-01-01 01:00:00;7 minutes;Very bright green light without sound moved over me and my car from a wooded area about a 1000 ft. up. I had just left my brothers house on new years eve late that night.  The new year had been in only about an hour.  As I got about a mile away from my brothers home, I noticed this very bright light in the distance, coming out of the sky and going down to the ground.   I didn't pay it any attention until I got closer to the source about two more miles towards home.  As I came up on this main street, this bright light came out of the sky again, and I thought it was a police hellicopter on some kind of patrol.  But then, I notice, there was NO noise coming from the light at all and the light was GREEN, and it was glowing on me, my whole car, and around the area I and my car was in, about a 20 feet area.  I looked at my car, and it was green inside and out, and freen all over me.  It was so strange because no one else one on the mostly busy road but me.  The quite bright green light withdrew back up in the air to the source, and then vanished.  One of the strange things of it was there was a great silent during the whole thing, no noise of any motor, just silent. Later in that week, I noticed others on the t.v. news across the nation noticed the very same thing as I did, the bright light with a green glow that was too bright to look at.  I didn't tell my wife about it til about a month later.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
I saw a redish colored orb that was observing lighting show thunderstorms & it displayed 2 amazing climbs and a huge burst of speed.;1987-08-01 00:00:00;2 minutes;I saw a reddish colored orb that was observing lighting show thunderstorms & it displayed 2 amazing climbs and a huge burst of speed. I was the captain, flying a four engine turbine powered aircraft (L-188) at flight level 230 (23,000 feet) inbound toward Indianapolis, Indiana, thence cleared to Ft. Wayne for the Detroit Star Ft. Wayne transition into YIP (Yipsilanti, Willow Run Airport, Mich.)  That’s a  'standard terminal arrival route.'   I was on a heading of about 030 degrees.  Both my first officer & flight engineer were doing other duties when I first spotted traffic at my 1100 position, 10 miles & slightly below me.  As captain, I always kept the red instrument panel lighting at a absolute minimum setting so as to have the best visibility outside.   I first spotted a cranberry red light.  It appeared as if it were just another aircraft in the clear night sky, no shape or size, just a red light in level steady flight about 4000 feet below me & 10 miles to my left moving left to right at a steady speed of about 400 knots, about the same speed I was doing.  The size of the light was just like any other aircraft’s rotating beacon or light, but this was a constant steady light, not like a normal pulsating rotating beacon that aircraft are required to have.  I noticed in was headed straight towards a large thunderstorm cloud that was at my 1 o'clock position and 10 miles.  This thunderstorm had constant & consistent in-cloud to in-cloud lighting strikes that really was lighting up the large cloud like a Chinese lantern.  The red light kept a steady 400 knot speed aiming right at the storm cloud.   Then when it got to within 200 yards of the thundercloud itself, the red light changed course from 110 degree direction to a 250 degree direction, instantly, still maintaining the constant 400 knot speed.  It didn't turn, like an aircraft makes a turn, it just changed course, instantly, like a curser on a computer is capable of doing when you jerk your mouse control quickly left to right.  Now it was heading straight towards a long line of constant lighting thunder storms, or squall line, that was at my 9 o'clock position and about 20 miles off my left wing tip.  As I watched the light move at a constant speed from my right to my left directly in front of me, it suddenly climbed at a perfect 45 degree up angle, leveled off for a about 2 miles and then climbed again at a perfect 45 degree up angle without any change in speed either time, to an altitude about 3000 feet above me.  It then turned slightly right to a heading of about 250 degrees straight toward a point just in front of the first of a long line of constant lighting thunderstorms. As soon as the red orb got established on the new heading towards the all lit up lightning squall line to my left, this red light went from its 400 knot speed to, I'm going to guess between 2ooo to 3000 miles per hour for about one long second then it again immediately went back to its slower 400 knot constant speed again.  It covered that 20 mile distance in just over a second, someone should be able to turn that into a speed in miles per hour.  It didn't accelerate up to that speed and it didn't decelerate back to the slower speed again, it just made an instant jump from a slow 400 knots to a really fast 3000 knot speed, for just over a second, covering the 20 mile distance and then immediately back to the same slower speed of about 400 knots.  It was amazing to watch.  After being a airline captain for over ten years I have never ever, before or since seen an object under such obvious control that maneuvered & changed speed instantly, at will, so they could maneuver to and observe the constant & consistent thunderstorm light show display. I watched it make one more turn to its left, a heading of about 190 degrees so as to parallel this long line of constant light shows off to its right side.  It was then behind me to my 8 o'clock position.  I brought the attention of my other two crewmembers just before the red light made its two 45 degree climbs, they saw that but couldn't see to jump in speed an jump back in speed because it was off to the left side of our aircraft.   It was under something’s control, sightseeing at thunderstorm light shows in the night, making 45 degree climbs and capable of unknown speeds that amazed me to the point that I only thought was to turn off my rotating beacon/navigation wing-tip lights to hide my aircraft in the dark from its view.  But I didn't even think to call Indy ARTCC and ask if they had it on their radar.   My two other crewmembers really didn't grasp what I quickly brought to their attention, it all was over in 2 minutes.  I saw something amazing, I don't know what it was, I just hope it was from Earth. I was an ATP, flying four engine aircraft all over North, South America and Europe, for about 30 of my 40 years aviation life, and I never even came close to having an accident.  I was lucky to always fly well maintained aircraft.   That’s my story.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Lights seemed perfectly spaced and moved at the same rate of speed. At approximately 7:05pm on Tuesday, November 16th, 1999 I was walking northeast from the building were I work, on the southeast side of Indianapolis, to my car in the parking lot for my lunch hour.  I was watching the sky when I noticed 4 bright green lights coming from the northeast moving downward at an approximately 45 degree angle.  It was such an unusual sight that I caught my breath and stopped walking to watch. The front light seemed larger, maybe about the size of Venus. The trailing 3 lights were slightly smaller.  All were very bright neon green. They seemed to be perfectly spaced apart and were all moving at the same rate of speed. The rate of speed seemed slow for a shooting star.  I saw them clearly for maybe 2 or 3 seconds, then trees partially blocked my vision.  I walked forward keeping them insight until they disappeared below the horizon.  The total length of the sighting was perhaps 6 or 7 seconds.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Two lights moving from the southwest heading north west.  My wife looked up and saw it also.  We moved to the front of the house.

It appears to be a bright star in thw western sky, about 40 degrees above the horizon It has been observed every night for about 2 weeks, except when skies overcast.The amazing thing is that as you watch it the light begins to move, drifting from side to side over about 45 degrees left or right. some times slowly, sometimes dashing across the sky, sometimes moving up in the sky  until almost overhead, then drifting or darting back to its original area of the sky.  During all these maneuvers the object appears to be a bright spot of light, sometimes with a faint red corona. It's most amazing  behavior is its transformation into a brightly colored little carnival badge, with what look like neon tubes emanating from its perimeter. At its brightest it seems to have gaudy feathers on it top,  abd shafts if red kigyht where legs would be. lights twinkle brightly, and the object moves slowly around as if parading its splendor. Then it turns back into a bright light and zooms around some more.My neighbors and I have observed fdor 8 or 9 nights amd I believe it is visible all night. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.

Two more object appear with-in 2-3 mins.  One directly above the original object and one to the left. They stoped and hovered for a few mins.  Another white light appears about a 1/4 of a mile south the of original three. It hovered for a moment and then went south the object # 2 & 3 followed.  About five mins later a fifth light seemed to appear out of the cloud and it for a moment and then headed south and it never approached the original light (that still had not moved). Finally a 6th white light appeared higher up.  At first I thought it was Venus because it was in the same spot for a while. It finally approached the original light and then headed south. The first light hovered a few mins longer and then headed south as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD));39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
A series of 4 lights appearing and disappearing in night sky, one at a time, in a straight line formation.;2004-11-07 01:40:00;15 secs;A series of 4 lights appearing and disappearing in night sky, one at a time, in a straight line formation. At about 1:40 a.m. I was driving North on I-465 in the Northwest part of Indianapolis, Indiana. A few degrees above the horizon I saw what appeared to be a falling star, i.e., a streak of white light moving downward. There was another white light just to the right of that, which I assumed was a star or planet. However, a few minutes later, I saw a series of lights in the same area of the sky that behaved oddly. I had traveled about five miles farther north, and it seemed that the lights I witnessed were now closer to me, i.e. somewhat larger and brighter, and a little higher in the sky. First, there was one light that seemed to be stationary, but appearing slightly larger than Venus on a clear night. What got my attention was that suddenly a second light appeared beside it, separated by a little distance, then a few seconds later a third light appeared, the same size, brightness, and distance apart, so there were three in a very straight alignment, parallel to the horizon. Next, the light on the left end of the formation dimmed and went out it took about 1/2 second to fade out, it didn't just blink off. As soon as it had gone out, a fourth light appeared on the right end of the formation, so there were three again. It was exactly the same size, brightness, and distance apart as the others. After a few more seconds, they each faded and dimmed out, one at a time, in sequence from left to right. After that, nothing. I have seen airplanes and helicopters in the night sky before, and this set of lights was like nothing I have ever seen. I would definitely consider this a sighting of UFO's.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

(It probably caught my attention because I had been outside about an hour earlier, it still being night, and I couldn’t recall seeing the light in that general part of the sky then.)  The light was about as bright as Jupiter, about 70 degrees above the horizon, and perfectly stationary in the constellation Cassiopeia.  The light was stationary for about 20 seconds, almost appearing as part of Cassiopeia.  Then, for a period of 2-3 seconds, it appeared to steadily ascend upwards into the sky across a very short distance (about 2 arc degrees), moving in a southerly direction, until diminishing in brightness and no longer visible.  I did not observe any lights, sounds, or movements from the light that would be commonly associated with common types of terrestrial aircraft.

Strange yellow lights streaked across the Indiana night sky;2008-10-18 20:00:00;1 second each;Strange yellow lights streaked across the Indiana night sky On Saturday evening October 18, 2008, I was in Indiana driving on Interstate 65 heading northwest from Indianapolis towards Gary.  I witnessed two similar phenomena occur twice within a half-hour or less of each other.  Not being too familiar with the area I don’t know exactly where I was located, but for the first event, I’d say I was between 25-50 miles northwest of Indianapolis, and for the second, maybe 50-75 miles northwest of Indianapolis.  For the second sighting, I’m reasonably sure that I was located no more than halfway between Indianapolis and Gary – most likely closer to Indianapolis.  Giving a generous estimation, I’d say both events occurred between 7:30 and 9:00 p.m. EST.  It’s more likely that they occurred between 7:30 and 8:30, but I wasn’t paying close attention to the time. I saw each time a single streak of yellow light occur in the northern sky heading north/northwest.  Each event lasted about 1 second each, moved extremely fast, and seemed to travel a great distance, assuming they were as far away as they appeared.  They looked to be pretty far away, but I could not accurately guess the number of miles.  The streaks were not directly overhead, but they were closer to being overhead than they were to the horizon.  They appeared to be as long as a pencil when it’s held at arm’s length away when they completed their streak.  There was a definite movement of the light.  That is, they did not appear immediately as a solid line.  They began as a point and streaked across a portion of the night sky, as if someone had drawn a line with a yellow marker.  As soon as the lights reached a certain distance, they faded immediately. There were no stars in the sky, and that coupled with the fact that I saw it twice led me to believe that they were not shooting stars.  It was not raining, nor was there thunder, so I’m sure they were not lightning streaks.  They appeared out of and returned to nothing, it seemed.  They were both very unnatural-looking phenomena. This is my first report of a sighting.  I thought these events were strange enough to deserve reporting.  I’d describe myself as being agnostic towards the existence of extra-terrestrials.  I don’t not believe in them.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
on 10/24/08 I observed 10-15 orange colored lighted objects floating or flying on the northeast side of Indianapolis.;2008-10-24 22:20:00;2-3 minutes;on 10/24/08 I observed 10-15 orange colored lighted objects floating or flying on the northeast side of Indianapolis. I am a police sergeant and while on duty on Friday (10/24/08) at approximately 22:20hrs., I observed about 10-15 amber colored lights floating or flying upwards.  I was parked in a downtown parking lot facing north when this occurred.  I iniatially observed 3 lights spaced pretty equally apart, but at slightly different altitudes.  Because of the downtown horizon I was unable to ascertain if they were coming up from the ground or just a slightly lower altitude.   These lights appeared to be coming from the northeast east quadrant of Marion County (about 10 miles away from me).   After noticing and watching the first three lights, I observed 3 or 4 more about 20-30 seconds behind, ascending in the same manner as the first 3. I then observed approximatly 6-8 more of these objects floating or flying upwards from the same area.  After getting so high into the sky the objects disappeared.   There was a cloud cover on this night, as we did have rainfall off and on.  I am not sure if the lights or objects just burned out or I was unable to see due to the clouds.  The puzzeling thing was that the clouds were going from west to east, and these objects were floating upwards from east to the west, into the wind, but only at a very gradual change.  Because these objects were going into the wind rather than with the wind, I quickly dismissed them as balloons of any kind but I could be wrong.   I have never seen anything like this before but there could be a legitimate reason for them.  I am just curious what they were.   I did watch the 6am newscast when I returned home from work and did not see any mention of the lights for legitimate or unknown purposes.  I did email the Indianapolis Star to see if they knew what the lights were, but so far I have not received a response.  I also observed what appeared to be a commercial aircraft heading towards the lights, but the lights had cleared its path by time the aircraft arrived in the area.  I would suspect there was a good possibility the aircraft pilots observed these lights as well.  The aircraft was going from the west to the east ( I assume leaving Indpls. Intn. Airport).   Several hours later when I returned to that spot (where I sit until a run comes out) I did observe what is mistakenly called a shooting star in the area.  This one appearred to be closer and brighter then ones I have seen in the past, but this could just be coincidence.  I just figured I would report it in case anyone else had seen it and no explanation could be found for the lights presence.  I also attempted to take cellphone pics and video of objects, but on review you can not see them due to poor camera quality on cellphone;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

White light turned red and vanished.;2013-04-25 08:45:00;30 seconds;white light turned red and vanished I was having a cigarette on my patio and my son was outside talking to me.  I was watching the sky just west and a little north of us because I thought it was unusual to see 7 jet airplanes flying so closely in the same area of sky.  I know they are farther from one another in the sky, but from the ground they looked very close to one another.  Still odd to see them so bunched up considering how vast the sky is!   It seemed as if they were confused, or that some air-traffic controller must have fallen asleep on the job.  My son agreed and as we watched the last two planes intersect safely there appeared a white light in the sky just above them.  At first glance I just thought it was a star. My son saw it too and it dawned on us that it wasn't there before!  We watched for a about 15 seconds and it moved a little, turned red, and simply vanished!  The rest of the evening I watched the sky for any other unusual happenings. I stayed up until 2:30 am and nearly everytime!  I went outside I noticed one strange reoccuring thing-all air traffic was bunched up in the same manner as earlier in the evening.  We never see so much air traffic out our way in the first place, so it just seems odd to see 3 to 7 planes all in the same patch of sky multiple times throughout the evening.

Strange white shape shrinks and disappears.;2013-07-25 08:00:00;45 seconds;Strange white shape shrinks and dissapears I noticed a bright light was glowing as I was driving to work.  I noticed it a few blocks further down in the direction I was driving but disarded it since some trees blocked most of it.  Figured it could have been a plane (there is an airport around the area) or the sun reflecting against something I don't know.  I reached a stop sign, which happened to be in front of where the light was and I got a clear view at it this time, no longer blocked by trees.  Right then and there I noticed it was shinning bright white light with a different form. The light was brighter on some areas. No other lights.  Just white light and the shape.  It was not a disk shape nor cone or anything that has been seen in pictures. It just stayed there for what seemed to be 20 seconds.  I was trying to pull my cell phone to try and take a picture and I realized, I was still at the stop sign so, I decided to make a left turn to continue my path seeing as there were cars behind me.  As I turned I just happened to look back and I noticed the driver behind me had his head sticking out looking at the same thing I was.  I made the left turn at a very slow pace while still looking at it.  Few seconds later, it seemed to have shrunk in size.  Once I completed my turn, trees again blocked my sight a bit so I decided to drive bit further and stop inside a neighberhood that was underneath the spot were the...light, figure what ever you want to call it was.   It was no longer there.  Even if it was a plane I am sure I would have still had been able to see it.  Same as a weather balloon or anything else we are used to see on a normal day. It was strange but it was not anything I had seen in pictures or sighting videos.  It was just bright white on all it's ends.   Again, it was not a disk, cone, nor small in size at first.  I can say it was probably the size of a car from the point of view I had.  The shape was just different.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Ring light.;2013-08-29 11:56:00;sighting;ring light I was going though my security camera showing my grand kids the video of them playing at night with the fire going.  By mistake I clicked on the wrong night that when I  notice a light coming in and a object came out of the rings of light that was lighting up my yard and deck and it landed in front of the back door of my patio.  Then after about six minutes of this light going around my patio as if it was looking for the object that came.  The light rings picked up the object and the light and object disappeared in to the sky.  I have live video still on my camera system.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Spherical orange lights seen in western sky by family of 3 in Indianapolis.;2013-10-08 19:30:00;6-8 minutes;Spherical orange lights seen in western sky by family of 3 in Indianapolis Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2013 7:30 p.m. ET  My husband, son and I were traveling south in our car on Keystone Avenue in Indianapolis, Indiana. The sky was perfectly clear and very light, as the sun was just setting. We turned west onto 38th Street, a six-lane-wide street with a clear view of the sky nearly down to the horizon. As soon as we were on 38th Street, we saw four lights in the western sky in front of us. Each light was round, orange, and approximately four to five times the size of Venus, which was also visible in the western sky.  Their position in the sky appeared to be approximately 15 to 20 degrees to the right of Venus.  The lights were arranged in a straight vertical line, like a column.  The lights were the same distance from each other, and as we continued to watch them, the two bottom lights moved laterally to the left away from the two upper lights while still holding their position relative to each other, one on top of the other.  Then the two bottom lights moved back beneath the top lights, still keeping the same distance between each other.  Then the bottom lights seemed to sink toward the horizon while the top lights seemed to move upwards in the opposite direction.   We continued to drive west on 38th Street while my son and I took photos with our phone cameras.  Suddenly, all four lights seemed to flatten out, changing in an instant from round, star-like orbs to flat, horizontal streaks.  This happened so quickly that there was no discernible process of change--the forms just appeared different, though the new shapes were the same orangish color and retained their positions relative to each other.   We drove off 38th Street into the 100 Acre Arts Park of the Indianapolis Museum of Art and stopped the car in an effort to see better, but by then the sky had darkened and the flat, horizontal streaks faded rapidly. As we scanned the sky for the shapes, we then saw two streaks of white moving rapidly across the sky in the same path as the shapes.  As the white streaks continued moving, we saw that they were contrails from airplanes.  We could see the dark forms and the blinking red and white lights of the planes as they flew overhead. I Googled UFO reporting on my phone and found the number for the National UFO Reporting Center.  I called and reported what we had seen and am submitting our separate reports of the sighting as instructed. My husband, son and I all witnessed this sight together, and we agreed that it was unlike anything any of us had ever seen before. Submitted by L. On Tuesday October 8, 2013, my wife, stepson, and I were traveling west on 38th street in Indianapolis, Indiana.  When we approached 38th and Fall Creek, I looked in the clear Western Sky. It was approximately 7:30 p.m. and that's when I noticed four lights in the sky. They were in a vertical formation, with what I would guess from the ground looked like they had about 100 to 200 yards between them.  We began following these lights.  Two of these lights smoothly and suddenly began to float in a horizontal pattern and headed southwest.  As the sun set, the lights became more difficult to see, almost as if they were cloaked by the sunlight. We followed the lights to the 100 Acre grounds of the Indianapolis Museum of Art.  It was there that my wife called the National UFO Center, and we were told that a similar phone call had been made only moments before from Pennsylvania, and the caller had reported seeing these lights in the Western sky. Submitted by K. It all started as my mom, stepdad, and I were driving home from my grandmother’s house. We were all having a jolly old time in the car, discussing various subjects like school, politics, and dreams.  As we were heading close to the road that leads to my stepdad’s house, my mom suddenly jumped up and shouted “LOOK, UP IN THE SKY!” I thought she was crazy until I put my glasses on and saw four orange-ish lights floating in unison.  After I saw them, my stepdad finally noticed them as well.  Right after we acknowledged their existence, two of the bottom-most lights began to fly left horizontally.  It was then that we realized that these HAD to have been UFOs. We started following the lights but to no avail.  The closer we drove to the lights, the darker the sky became, and eventually the two remaining lights disappeared on the horizon.  We stopped near the Indianapolis Museum of Art to look up, but still nothing could be seen.  It was then that my mom called in the UFO hotline and reported our findings.  What intrigued me the most is how the operator mentioned someone in Pennsylvania reporting the exact same sighting as us mere minutes before we called in.

Red light over West Indianapolis.;2014-09-26 22:00:00;5 minutes;Red light over west indianapolis. Red light or orb slowly moving across Indianapolis sky at 22:00. At first I thought maybe it was a helicopter however, the light was not consistent with any plane or heli i have ever seen. There was absolutely no noise at all and I followed it for a few minutes until it disappeared. Moved from north west to south direction. It was gone in a blink of the eye.

4th of July.  Visitors enjoy a fireworks show, while I watched them.;2016-07-04 22:30:00;5 minutes;4th of July.  Visitors enjoy a fireworks show, while I watched them. I was watching neighbors shoot off fireworks.  Their backs were to the craft.  There were 5 lights in the shape of the 5 side of a die.  The object was in the northwest sky. I first thought it was a Japanese lantern, since it was the 4th of July.  However, as I continued to gaze, the object didn't follow the typical Japanese lantern pattern. An interesting few things happened, as I intently watched the object.  The object seemed to be watching the fireworks the neighbors were shooting off.  Then in a split second, the object dropped down vertically and straight back up to its location.  The brightness level stayed the same, the whole time. I went inside to grab my telescope to see it closer, when I returned, it was gone.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Silent orange orbs fly very low and disappear.;2016-09-23 22:00:00;1 minutes;Silent orange orbs fly very low and disappear. I saw two orange orbs from my backyard. Both were moving in different directions, one west, the other north-east. The lights looked very low, and didn't flicker or wobble. No sound, as one flew nearly directly overhead. I called my girlfriend outside, who managed to witness one before we lost sight. They followed a straight path before disappearing behind trees and houses. I work at night at a busy airport, and I have never witnessed anything like it. Unsettling because of their altitude and how close to home they were, and their silence. A friend of mine several blocks to my north witnessed five orange orbs in a formation while looking my direction, on the same evening. He watched them disappear all at once, as if turning off an old TV.  Best rational explanation I can think of is Chinese lanterns or drones, though those explanations don't satisfy me.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Light/object moved sporadically for almost 50 minutes, unexplainable speed and precision.  ((NUFORC Note;2017-09-23 02:00:00;>40 minutes;Light/object moved sporadically for almost 50 minuets, unexplainable speed and precision. Stepped outside to have a smoke, and I tend to look at the sky, and to the northeast sky, I see a light, flashing like a plane far off in the distance would, but I noticed the object wasn't moving away or towards me but rather up and down, rather quickly.  Also it moved in an oval shape from time to time and also in a close figure eight movement.   It also seemed to turn, that's when I noticed it wasn't really flashing but something else.  I really can't explain how this thing was moving.   I have a few videos I tried to take.  You can clearly see the light/object.  You can see it moving sporadically up and down, side to side.  My heart was pounding a few times because of the way this thing was moving, and how fast and precise it was.  Honestly amazing.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Speed was steady, not fast, not erratic.  As they approached thicker cloud cover, we lost sight of them.  Overall time span lasted about 11 minutes.  They emitted no sound, no flashing or strobes.

2 Very fast Lights Chasing each other from East to West right above cloud line.;2018-10-23 07:17:00;10 seconds;2 Very fast Lights Chasing each other from East to West right above cloud line. This morning at 7:17am, when going to warm up my car, I saw 2 UFO'S chasing each other!  They were white lights.  They caught my eye because at first, I thought they were shooting stars but they were way too big and low.  They were flying right above the cloud line and going faster than any aircraft I've EVER seen.  I live by the airport so I'm used to seeing aircrafts all night and day long.  This lasted 10 seconds.  They were playing over my house and reminded me of kids chasing each other.  They flew in snake like formation not a straight line.  They went from the west sky until they went so far east they disappeared from my range of sight.  They appeared to be their own light source.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Saw an electric blue light against the blue sky.  Clouds were out but minimal you could see thr;2019-06-14 11:40:00;5 minutes;Walking my dog at dog park before noon.  Saw an electric blue light against the blue sky.   Clouds were out but minimal you could see through them.  It stood out but you had to really look to see it.  It went from one end of the park to the other.  I tried to video it w/ my IPhone 6S, but it didn’t show up on video until the last 2 sec.  It flew towards an industrial park 5 min from the dog park.   I stayed for about 10 min to see if it would come back, but I lost it.  On my way back home passing the industrial park on my right, there was a helicopter.  I was driving and couldn’t really tell, but to me it looked like it had no markings and it could have been a black helicopter.  There is a military base 10 min away from the park and industrial area.  I was driving and could not stop so I can't confirm it was a black helicopter.  I don’t think it a coincidence that I see a UFO and there’s a helicopter flying around the vicinity after.   I’m frustrated as the UFO only shows up o! n video the last 2 sec, when I clearly and visually saw it the whole time while recording.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Small light moving erratically over shopping plaza high in sky.;2019-07-01 01:38:00;~30 minutes;Small light moving erratically over shopping plaza high in sky. We were at a Laundry & Tan Connection, and my girlfriend said she saw something weird in the sky, from our car, far away, and couldn’t tell if it was a satellite or plane, and asked me.  I took a look, and noticed flashing lights so I said it was a plane.  I went back inside the laundromat and came back out about 25 minutes later, and my girlfriend pointed it out to me again, making a point of how erratic and quick its movements were.  I observed, and noticed the same.  It is moving too fast to be a conventional plane, and my girlfriend says that it’s too high up to be helicopter.   Her father is Air Force and has shown her various aircraft and she says it just isn’t moving right.  She says it’s almost moving like a fishing lure, jerking around a lot.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Strange rotating lights seen over Indianapolis Airport Hub.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly advertising lights.  PD));2019-11-28 23:50:00;1-3 minutes;Strange rotating lights seen over Indianapolis Airport Hub I was returning to work after getting food on 11/28/19 around 23:50 hours and noticed 4 to 5 lights rotating in a counter-clockwise formation equally spaced apart from each other in a diameter.  The lights while rotating would zoom into the center and then back out to the exact distance they originated from above the Fed Ex Hub at the airport (Above the control tower from the perspective to my location). The clouds were low hanging, no craft was visible.  I thought that it was strange to be seeing that but also that it had to be some sort of ground light making this effect. I  asked my senior officer about this on 12/2/19 and he stated that there is nothing that would produce that over the hub.  I have not seen the pattern before or sense.  I then searched the internet and located this reporting site that also has a claim of strange lights in Indianapolis roughly 15 to 20 minutes after the time I had observed them.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Bright light on southern Indianapolis from East to NWest;2020-08-26 21:45:00;1 minutes;Bright light on southern Indianapolis from East to NWest There was a power failure around my block, so with the family we went outside to enjoy more of the fresh air... I took my binoculars (50x10) perhaps to show the kids airplanes, Jupiter and some stars.  We are south of the Indianapolis International Airport, so usually there's a lot of light pollution, light pollution was still plentiful however there was a flight coming from south towards the airport and I asked my son to have a look with the binoculars. As the flight passed right on top of our heads I noticed this very bright light approaching from North East (over 2 o'clock if pointing North).  I excitedly asked my son that was using the binoculars to look at it (wife, sons and little daughter were there), few seconds later I got the binoculars. When looking this object (roughly at the brightness of Jupiter) I didn't see any blinking light or discernible light, so I thought it could have been the ISS, I have seen it before, but with a 10 times magnification is a bit squarish (I have seen it before).  I asked my elder daughter to pass me her phone so that I could check the ISS using her data, but to my surprise it was on an orbit to South America, hence, I'm writing this. When I checked the phone the time was 9:56 PM, thus my reported time is approximated, if possible to trace that airplane passing overhead the time would be found precisely. 15 minutes later there was another less bright UFO (I call it such because I checked it with binoculars and was not a plane), this was from the direction of the airport towards South.  On addition, I have seen an object following the same path before, but not this bright.  And few minutes later the same will go in the other direction... sincerely they seem too bright to be satellites.  At this main one I'm reporting I'm pretty sure was way too bright. After the second UFO my wife started complaining about me being too excited and noisy, and told me that she has seen it multiple times once even during the day, just a light, same direction.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Now what got my attention of this u.f.o is the flickering, but after dismissing it a few times I started to see different colors in these flickers, and so I was like let me look at this closer, upon looking closer at it, it mesmerizes you with the perfect circle of flashy red, and blue, and greens, it's like how is it flashing like this and noone can see it or it goes un-noticed. Anyhow finally wanted to report this thing. It sits in the southwest to south east skies, and it flickers like a star, but if you look close it's full of colorful flashes!!;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
