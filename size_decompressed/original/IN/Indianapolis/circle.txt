A rotating, soundless object followed me home from boy scouts.;1993-04-13 22:30:00;10-15 minutes;A rotating, soundless object followed me home from boy scouts. I am unsure of the exact date but I know that it was my fourth grade year of school in the spring.  I was walking home from Boy Scouts on a monday night when I saw an object above me.  It was about fifty feet over the tree tops.  For about three blocks the object was slightly  behind me.  As I turned right onto my street the object did not follow any longer.  No one except for me was on the street.  I then ran into my house.  Watching TV in my sun room I saw it again outside of the windows.  Then later, I went upstairs to my room to go to sleep.  I felt that something was outside so I pulled back my curtins.  The same object as before was about fifty feet above my neighbor's house across the street.  I then remember going to sleep.  The next day at school I asked the class if they had seen anything weird the night before. A couple of people said that they had seen a strange object.  These classmates were from my eastside neighborhood. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Bright wheel looking light, changing colors and size;2002-12-16 06:30:00;1.5 hours;((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star, perhaps Sirius, or perhaps Venus, located in the eastern sky.  PD)) Bright wheel looking light, changing colors and size It caught our attention because it was so bright, and it was illuminating a smaller object just below it that had no light. The object originally appeared to be vertically oblong, and the object below it appeared to be a smaller metal sphere. We got the digital camera out to zoom in closer, and observed that there were bright blue and green lights surrounding the object, with a red flashing light on it's right side. As we watched, the larger object would reduce slightly in size, then change to a purple and green color around it's edge, then seemed to 'explode' into a much larger array of light, probably three times it's original size, and highly resembled a wagon wheel with smaller lights on the tip of each spoke and single bright light in the center. The object at that time would be spinning. This can be observed and appears to be obvious on our video tape. The color of it at that time would change into different intensities of pinks, yellows, greens and sometimes blue and red. Then, the object would again reduce in size back to it's original appearance. The smaller object did not come out on any of our video, yet was obvious without the aid of any magnification. But because it was only shown by the reflecton of the light from the larger object, this evidentally caused it not to show up because of light and dark filters on our camera. Our video is approximately 15 minutes long and we also have several good still shots taken off the tape as well.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

At approximately 10pm on Friday night, October 21, 2011, my daughter and I were driving out of our neighborhood when suddenly up in the eastern sky, I saw what looked like multiple golden/orange objects in the sky.

At first I thought it was a plane coming in, since it was near the airport, but I noticed there were no blinking lights.  As I continued to watch, the object stopped moving.  It seemed to be quite close at this point (within a mile).  I watched to make sure it was a helicopter, but it showed no signs of it, and made no noise.  As I pulled into my driveway, a tree momentarily blocked my view.  When I walked around the tree to get a better view, the light had disappeared.

Time was around 9:30ish PM, event lasted about 5 minutes. I was sitting in my back patio having a cigarette and all of a sudden the circle orange globe objects, 2 of them, appeared on my right hand side in my peripheral view, I turned and followed, they were moving in unison and on a parallel, straight line target. I was surprised and immediately got out of my seat and walked backwards while keeping my eyes on the objects, which were moving from south west to north east, with no noise and as I got further out in my backyard the objects slowed down as I observed them, and them me, and then they slowly started to increase in speed and move in the direction to the north east.   I then decided to run inside and get my cell phone but by the time i got it they had moved from the side of the house to the front on the house and I ran inside to go through the house to go out the front door, as I did I shouted my wife, she and the kids came out and we all stood out front of the house.  The objects had moved off into the distance by this time and only one of them could be seen far away above the tree line.

Orange orb spotted on north side of Indianapolis near Castleton area.  ((anonymous report));2016-06-12 04:00:00;2 minutes;Orange orb spotted on north side of Indianapolis near Castleton area. First, let me begin by saying that i have NEVER reported or seen anything like this before in my life.  I know that we are not the only ones living in the universe.  However coming in contact with something not from here is very eye opening.   I was laying down in my bed, there is a dog in our neighborhood who was barking.  There is a window right above the head of my bed.  I see a light out the corner of my eye.  I turn my head to look and there it was:  A large bright orange orb.  I couldn't even say it was a plane or a helicopter.  It was close enough that I could see exactly what it was.   I got scared, ran downstairs to wake up my 73 yr old mother.  I can't get the image out of my head.  This happened at 4:00 am,  it was still completely dark outside.   I'm still scared, because I just don't understand and I can't justify what I saw.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

A Giant, Three-Level Craft on Fourth of July.;2017-07-04 13:00:00;10 minutes;A Giant, Three-Level Craft on Fourth of July. I am sure of the day, but not the year. It was Fourth of July in early afternoon.  I went into my large backyard and happened to glance up.  The sky was bright blue and small white clouds were traveling northward. There was one large cloud to the near northwest that was the same color as the rest, moving (sort of bubbling in place but not changing position in the sky). The smaller clouds were moving past it, above and below. Then I realized that the large, stationary cloud was mostly concealing an enormous craft. I noticed it because most of it was concealed by the cloud, except for the front and about 4 or 5 dark openings.  The color of the craft was a pale, washed-out gray.  From my vantage point, I couldn’t tell whether I was seeing a side view of a disc or of a cigar-shaped object. The overall effect was like seeing the nose of a cruise ship peeking out of a cloud.  The structure I could observe resembled a 3-layer cake. The top layer was the smallest and had no openings. The second layer was larger and wider, and had about 4 or 5 dark, vertically rectangular openings, being a bit wider at the bottom. The rest were concealed by the cloud. The third layer was still larger and had no openings that I could see.  I don’t know how big the craft was but judging from what I saw, it must have been hundreds of feet across.  I have never doubted life beyond that on Earth, so the sight didn’t much affect me. I went back in the house, came out again five minutes later and it was still there. It was gone about twenty minutes after that. I should have had the presence of mind to photograph it.  I have told my wife and two other people about this. I think it makes them uncomfortable.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

I try to take a picture but the camera for what ever reason would not capture the image. We ran out back and they were still in sight. It was dusk and they were no longer lit up. No sound no erratic movement just floating to the southwest. I ran around to the front of the house and continued to watch them. I had my phone and thought I was recording but unfortunately, I must not have hit the record button.
