Looked like a star but there were no other stars in the sky. I saw this object in the sky while (it was to the west) driving home from dinner at a fastfood restraunt.  It was on a back road of a residenntial area.  The object was very far away.  First, I thought it was a star.  Then, I looked for other stars in the sky.  There were none.  I kept watching for 3-5 minutes and wondered what it was and then I drove by some trees and lost it.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Object meandered like a leaf in a stream.;2000-09-11 23:17:00;3-4 minutes;Object meandered like a leaf in a stream. Object 1st noticed between Pole star & 3-star triangle S.E. of Pole star. At 1st thought it to be a planet but realized it to be too far off the plane of the ecliptic. Object had a constant yellow-orange appearance. No whirling or color changes. I next thought it to be a stationary star till I realized it was moving too fast for an aircraft relative to other stars. Two observations: 1. It was moving in a South-east direction from the point of 1st notice. 2. It seemed to meander like a leaf floating along in a small stream that is affected by eddys.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Highly metalic sphere appeared from contrail and then went back in and out of view.;2003-09-07 17:45:00;5 seconds;Highly metalic sphere appeared from contrail and then went back in and out of view. At 5:45pm 09-07-2003 I was traveling east-bound in my car on I-70 about 3 miles East of Indianapolis.  I saw a round highly metallic Sphere to the North of me and from my position my line of sight was about 70-degree angle.  The Shiny silver ball which I estimate the diamater to be 3-5 feet at about 2000-feet high. The object appeared to my sight as it left a persistant contrail it came from.  The sphere traveled about 100-feet from the contrail and then stopped and reversed direction back into the persistant contail.  The sphere was visible for approx. 5-seconds.  This was no aircraft or balloon nor anything eles in my minds rolodex.  This object moved with intent and purpose.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Sphere shape object with flashing bright white lights;2003-10-10 18:00:00;30 minutes;Sphere shape object with flashing bright white lights Heading South on Emerson Ave I spotted blinking lights in the sky in the South/East direction. First thought it was an airplane, but the flashing lights were more like camera light bulbs going off all at once and not just normal blinking lights you see on an airplane, Lights were bright white flashes, with no color. Looked like it was headed in a southerly direction but remained in the same location for long periods of time... lasted until trees obscured my view. I had a gut-feeling this was not a normal type of craft for some reason... hearing more and more people making comments also about seeing odd crafts in the sky lately... not sure what is going on.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

What struck me more is the abnormal degree of turn it made after traveling very close to an obvious airplane when suddenly it shot to the ground at a complete 90Â° angle where it then disappeared   I My friend in I purely in awe attempted to chase the UFO but could not find anything.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Bright Orange Sphere over Far Southside of Indianapolis;2013-07-29 10:23:00;8-10 minutes;Bright Orange Sphere over Far Southside of Indianapolis My husband and I were leaving the AMC movie theater at US31 and I-465 on the far south side of Indianapolis at 10:23 pm.  We both noticed a very, very bright orange light at 45 degrees north of us. Initially thought it was a planet.  As we watched it, a commercial airliner came in for a landing and we could tell this thing was much larger than an airliner and at a much higher altitude.  The thing resembled a Chinese lantern and flickered very bright orange and white light.  We continued to watch it as it flew overhead.  Once overhead, it was round and very light grey in color.  Made no sound and had a S-SE trajectory.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Red light with white halo around it.  Moving up and down back and forth through the night sky just above the tree lines.;2014-10-28 20:00:00;10 minutes;Red light with white halo around it.  Moving up and down back and forth through the night sky just above the tree lines. At 8:00 pm I let my dog outside.  I looked up to the north east sky and seen a red ball of light with a white halo around it.  It looked like it was going to Land but then Rose straight back up into the sky very quickly That caught my attention.  I told my wife to come quick and look. We both watched as the object moved back and fourth through the sky.  It headed to the ground like it Was going to land, but went straight up into the sky moved left and right very quick and without changing altitude. then it went below the tree line.  We waited for a few minutes and went back into the house.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Saw small glowing red spheres on the 4th of July in Indianapolis.  (Definitley not lanterns or flares.);2016-07-04 21:30:00;~30 minutes;Saw small glowing red spheres on the 4th of July in Indianapolis. (Definitley not lanterns or flares.) Responding to a YouTube video,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcMKJbbkgok   I posted the following comment:  July 4th 2016 - We saw them in Indianapolis, Indiana.  I believe they are military drones that detect radiation emitted from possible nuclear devices or dirty bombs all around the country. Apparently people see them in every major population center around the USA.  I say, Good job military, I appreciate the protection.  Thanks for keeping us safe!  They seemed to be on patrol.  We would see them in one area of the sky, then they would move off and disappear and reappear somewhere else. Very impressive.  I can't rule out the possibility that they could be UFOs, but with the threat of terrorism on a holiday like the 4th of July, it's just my sense that they were ours.  Obviously must be a secret military program. In the check boxes below, nothing applied.  The object(s) themselves glowed orangish red.  They seemed to be basketball or beach ball sized. ((NUFORC Note:  We doubt that the lights were drones.  PD));39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Then I noticed a trail of smaller bright, white dots (about the size of other stars), lined up straight, and traveling upwaed and to the left from my view.  There were 20 to 30 of them. I missed counting to take out my phone to film.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
