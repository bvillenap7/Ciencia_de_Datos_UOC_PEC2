I have no idea of the altitude, since I don't know the actual size, but when I held my fist at arm,s length there was still a full inch showing on both sides of my hand.  The object traveled slowly from west to east directly over my home. At 08:40 I was leaving home for work as a federal security officer.  I looked into the sky  to check out the contrails.  There were absolutely no clouds in the sky, and only a few contrails.  Just below the contrails I noted a smoky gray cylinder floating through the sky from west to east.  It appeared to be about the same size as a 747 would appear at about 5,000 feet. It proceeded to fly directly over my home.  I noted also that it was divided into thirds by blue vertical lines.  As it went behind a tree in the yard, there was a flash of some type of energy in the middle third of the cylinder.  I then stepped to the other side of the tree to try to pick it up as it came out the other side, but it never came out.  The size of this object The object protruded about on inch when compared to my closed fist held at arms length.  There was no tail or wings and no noise of any kind.  There was also no wind that might have moved any noise away from me.  I tried to convince myself that this was just a jet liner, but I watch jets in the sky frequently and have never seen anything like this before.  I tried to blow it off but the next night objects of similar description were reported by Mr. Davenport on Coast to Coast. I wish someone else had seen it and reported.  But according to the data on your sight, they have not.  There was something very strange.  The image almost seemed to be computer animation and the flash of energy in the middle section looked just like a cartoon drawing of an explosion.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

While making a round i noticed a glowing object hovering just above some high tension lines. I watched the object start to slowly move to the south from my position and made out a elongated cylinder softly glowing , apparently from the inside.I called to a fellow employee who also saw the same thing. Our security truck was parked almost directly under the object and it was a  little larger than the s-15 GMC. tHE OBJECT WAS VISIBLE FOR APP. 3 MINUTES.it flew south making no sound untill it vanished from sight.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Object was a silver cylinder with a bright flourescent blue round top.  It reminded me of a wand or staff.;2005-10-30 13:00:00;3 min;I noticed two airplanes following pretty close to one another in a straight line heading south/southeast at around 1:00pm on October 30th during a bright sunny day.  Both planes were leaving smoke trails through the sky as they moved.  I grabbed a pair of binoculars to get a closer view since I never see two planes traveling so close together.   As I was veiwing the planes I noticed this object moving perpindicular in a downward motion away from the planes.  At first I thought maybe they dropped something or that maybe I'm seeing a satelite moving in space?   The object was a silver cylinder with a bright flourescent blue round top.   It reminded me of a wand or staff.  It was kind of moving back a forth as it appeared to move down away from the planes.   I've never seen anything like it before.  I'm thinking it may of been a satellite, but it was to big in comparison to the planes I think to be a satelite, plus I don't know if I would be able to see a satelite that well being that they are higher up outside the atmosphere.   It was definately weird..!!  Possibly a UFO?;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
silver cylinder object in sky 3ft L x 2Ft H white circle moved to cover whole object then disappeared;2010-11-02 14:20:00;60 secs;silver cylinder object in sky 3ft L x 2Ft H white circle moved to cover whole object then disappeared I would like to report a UFO that I saw Nov. 2nd  2010. it was in Indianapolis Indiana. I was at the corner of Southeastern Ave and Arlington Ave. it was in the SW sky.  It looked to be about 3ft long and about 2ft high. It was silver in color and it only stayed for less than a minute. The silver was the shade of a trashcan.  As I was watching this object it looked like a white circle rose from the bottom left and moved to the top right. Once it finished it disappeared.  There were no blimps in the vicinity. It just hung in the air and then the circle of white moved to encompass the object. It appeared to be only one.  The sky was clear with some white clouds higher up than the object.  The address was ((deleted))  Southeastern Ave.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
((HOAX??))  Massive cylinder shaped object, thousands of feet long.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no personal data.  PD));2013-06-29 22:30:00;15 seconds;Massive cylinder shaped object, thousands of feet long. Noticed a large bright object approaching from the northwest.  Was moving fast on a horizontal flight path.  As it got closer the center appeared molten, ie: black/orange/red at the sides flowing to a white core. Exterior appeared to be metal with discolored areas.  It had huge sections of plating seemed together.  There was no pattern to the plating, just giant random pieces distinguishable by the dark colored seems. Shaped was more of a slowly tampering cone and was imperfect, had inconsistencies and appeared somewhat organic in design. Object came to a full stop and then vanished... This thing was not a flare, cloud, smoke, somebody playing with an RC toy, or frickin weather balloon.  It was huge, thousands of feet long and absolutely not made by man. NO way.. It was very frightening, we are absolutely terrified. I feel really ignorant now having expectations/ideas of friendly little UFOs buzzing around the galaxy on expedition.  This thing was massive and looked more like some horrible war ship out of the movies. Someone else has too see thisâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
There were 2 aircraft. One has lights. The other did not. The one without lights was massive. Both craft were at a high altitude.;2013-12-28 01:15:00;5 minutes;There were 2 aircraft.  One has lights.  The other did not.  The one without lights was massive.  Both craft were at a high altitude. I seen two space craft.  Or at least what I think what I have seen.  One was like a normal aircraft but was to high for a normal airliner and like a weird light pattern.  It has rectangle LED style light all under the wings.  At some point those lights turned off to like make it look like a normal aircraft.  But it was very high up to where if it was normal lights I wouldn't be able to see it because those lights would of been turned off at that altitude.    The other ship I saw looked like a mother ship that you would see off the movies.  It had no lights and I had to look and stare at it to see it.  It did not move and it just hovered at a high altitude.  It looked black and it was like a cylinder shape with massive size wings.  I  was talking to a friend on Skype and I went out there for a second time to turn on my cam.  He saw the mother ship style thing.  Then that is when I saw the second ship that I talked above above.  The wings of the LED style craft looked to leaned back to be a normal aircraft.  The mother ship style thing looked MASSIVE at that high altitude.  I would guess it would be at a altitude of around 30 to 50 thousand feet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
