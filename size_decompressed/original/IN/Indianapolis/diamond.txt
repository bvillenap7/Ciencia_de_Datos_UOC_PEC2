Bright lights in the city of Indy...UFO???;2012-02-22 01:00:00;1 hour;Bright lights in the city of Indy...UFO??? I noticed 2 bright lights come together in the sky and I pulled my phone and began to record.  The lights went in separate directions and I proceeded to record, I noticed several other lights in the sky but was unable to record all of them.  Shortly after this event which lasted at least 45 min  it appeared to be followed by what appeared to be military craft observing the area.  My camera work was shaky at best because of my sheer excitement of trying to figure out what i was looking at.  At one point I drove under the light and nearly dropped my phone trying to capture the uniqueness of the object.  I am completely convinced this wasnt an aircraft but I will leave that for someone with trained eyes and a amplifier to decide.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Multiple flying and lit-up diamond shaped objects were seen going from one specific place to another.  ((anonymous report));2016-12-30 01:01:00;51 minutes;Multiple flying and lit-up diamond-shaped objects were seen going from one specific place to another waiting in sync for each one to go. Around 1:01AM on Friday December 30th, 2016, I witnessed multiple flying objects in the night sky.  I was up watching a show, when all of a sudden I heard a loud and peculiar noise, not one of an airplane but it was louder and more high pitched.  I looked out of my bedroom window and noticed a flying, lit-up diamond shaped object coming from across the sky, so I watched it.  Curiously I stayed until it was out of sight then right as I was about to turn around I saw another one coming from the same area where the first one had come from.  So I waited for that one to pass but before I knew it I was there for over 45 minuets just watching these objects go from one side of my window to the other.  Finally I had gotten tired of waiting for another one after about the 15th one so I headed to bed. There was a gap between the 15th,16th and 17th ones.  Around 1:55AM, I went to lay down in bed whenever I heard the noise get louder.  Two of the objects flew close to each other a! nd stopped.  About 15-20 seconds later they left one going one way and the other the other way.  I thought it was finally over until I heard the noise coming back again, but shortly after that, a train came at 2:02AM, and after that train, there were no more flying objects that were seen.
