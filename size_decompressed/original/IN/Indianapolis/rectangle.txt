I was driving North bound on I-465, headed in a SE direction according to my compass in my van. At about mile marker 25 I noticed a tall rectangle in the overcast sky. The sky was typical gray-blue, as commonly seen here in the winter. I think this is why I noticed this shape, it was just up there in the sky to my right. It was white in color, rectangle in shape with a glow around it. Traffic was light to moderate at the time so I was able to look around in the sky and to my left, about North, I saw two contrails. So now I am watching this shape to my right and the contrails which are closing in on the shape on my left. I kept comparing the two situations and the two contrails were headed right for the shape. As the contrails got close to the shape they seem to split into seperate directions around the shape. The shape never seemed to move, change in appearance, it just floated there. At this point I went past the point to see any more activity. I have been around aircraft all my life. My father was in the Air National Guard and my uncle was a high ranking officer in the Air Force. I also have worked for Boeing in WA. In the report I refer to contrails moving to intercept the shape because I never saw what these aircraft were.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Rectangular shaped object hovering on Northeast side of Indy;2008-10-15 19:30:00;?;Rectangular shaped object hovering on Northeast side of Indy While driving south on US 37 (Binford) around 7:30 pm I noticed a rectangular shaped object hovering , then move east slowly and at an irregular pace.   It must have turned 90 degrees, because then it appeared to be a thin line.  I didn't see any lights, but it was solid and appeared silver.   It kept heading east(hovering, then moving slowly) and disappeared behind trees.   I was so tempted to follow, but I wasn't really sure what I was looking at, I was headed to a fitness class and I didn't want to piss any aliens off.  I really wish I had a camera with me because it was definitely unlike anything I've seen before.    I always thought UFOs were supposed to be round or at least more aerodynamic?

2 dimentional, matte gray rectangle, slowly moving apx, 1000 or 2000 ft. off ground, no lights;2009-05-05 08:46:00;apx. 3 minutes;2 dimentional, matte gray rectangle, slowly moving apx, 1000 or 2000 ft. off ground, no lights May 5, 2009 May 5, 2009 Indianapolis, IN 8:46 a.m. 1)  This not a hoax. 2)  I have ingested no drugs or alcohol and am not deprived of sleep. 3)  I am not crazy, or otherwise distressed. 4)  I am not seeking attention or recognition of any kind. 5)  I didn’t even believe in UFO’s or the people reporting them until today. 6)  I have a college education and an I.Q. over 120. 7)  I am in my thirties, have reasonably good eyesight, married with 2 children. 8)  I am not selling drawings, info, interviews or otherwise attempting to profit from this report. This morning for aprox. 3 minutes I observed a large matte gray rectangle or trapezoid that appeared to have only 2-dimmentions. It was traveling very slowly, possibly floating, to the east @ much less than 100 m.p.h. apx. 1000-2000 feet above the ground. It was not rotating and it had no visible lights. The object had no depth like piece of paper or a thin sheet of metal but was not shinny. Visually, it seemed to be only one side of a larger 3-dimmentional object. I detected no noise or possible propulsion system. The object was DEFINATLY NOT being towed or otherwise supported from the ground. The was greater than 50 ft. wide and high, but was not over 300 ft. in any direction.  I was able to positively conclude the following. 1)  This was not a commercial or civilian aircraft. 2)  This was NOT a ballon or zeppelin if and known kind. 3)  This was not any military project that is public knowledge. 4)  This was not a reflection or other natural phenomenon. 5)  This was not a bird, kite, or  hoax perpetrated by another individual. 6)  It was created or manufactured by intelligent being using unknown technology. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this individual, and we found him to be quite eloquent, sober-minded, and apparently sincere.  We suspect that his is a very good witness.

Huge, translucent vertical rectangle spotted floating in sky before sunset around 20:00 in Central Indiana;2010-06-01 20:00:00;1 minute;Huge, translucent vertical rectangle spotted floating in sky before sunset around 20:00 in Central Indiana I was driving east on U.S. 40 around 8 p.m. on 5/01/10.  My attention was drawn to the sky in the southeast by a flash resembling a flare or a dud fireworks.  I became aware of a translucent object, a long, vertical rectangle with well-defined corners that floated north from the location of the flash. We are on Daylight Savings Time in Indiana and still have plenty of sunlight at that hour.   At first I doublechecked to make sure the object was not a banner being flown from an airplane, but the object had to be at least a mile from top to bottom. I slowed the car and got into the right turn lane and inched along.   The object, like a gigantic plastic film in the sky, kept moving north and was gradually assimilated or hidden by a darker cloud. I don't think this was a reflection of something on my windshield, because of the way the object moved, then remained stationary for a moment, even though my auto continued to move.  I had to turn into a parking lot at tha! t point and did not see the object after that. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) To the staff:  I filed a serious, legitimate report but mislabled the date of the incident as 5/01/10 instead of 6/01/10.  This was a typographical error made in the way people use the previous month or year right after the date has changed.  Because it's the beginning of June, I've been putting 05 as the month on paperwork.  My deepest apologies -- however, I want to stress that the report as filed is serious for a sighting on 6/01/10.
