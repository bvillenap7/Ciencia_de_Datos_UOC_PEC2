Was playing outside. saw a round object colored red and moon yellow to the north. I was frightened ran inside screaming. The object was similar in size to the moon.  It appeared rather suddenly. When my dad came out to look at what I was screaming about it was gone. The day was hot and hazy.  I remember the object was hovering over the bride which if its the 16ht street bridge it would have been due north. I was at a friend's house at the time.  As far as I can remember I was the only witness to this. I have never reported this.  I saw a special on A&E on UFO's and there was a drawing of a UFO identical to the one I saw. Note on information.  Contacting me could result in problems with work or my husband Please email me if you wish me to contact you so I can do so when it would not cause a problem.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Odd lights/large slow craft north of indy?;2004-10-29 23:45:00;2-4 minutes;Odd lights/large slow craft north of indy? I left the house to pick up my kid when I noticed an aircraft in the south sky.  Something about it seemed a little off, so I became distracted enough that I found it hard to watch the road instead of the sky.  What I saw was confusing. It was a line of 4 or 5 white and amber lights, much like an aircraft but much too large to be as distant as it looked. It moved slowly and silently, gliding low in the sky. I lost sight of it through the trees a few times as I drove. A minute or two later there were a few other small, slow triangles of blinking light in the sky, too. One triangle soon looked more like a diamond.  For one brief instant, the line of lights seemed to have a faint gray coin shape below it, as if the whole thing might be a lighted disc tilted to an angle. The small objects seemed to move less slowly. Some lights blinked or changed from white to amber, but I canâ€™t remember a pattern. It all just seemed odd and moving strangely.  I was north of Indy, at about 116th street, driving south as I saw this to my south/southwest, toward some radio towers. The lights were drifting east.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

Vertical, white, smoky cigar shape.  White light a tboth ends. Lights did not flash. I saw it while driving. I left work at 11:00PM. I was driving E. on 86th. St. I saw a white, smoky, vertical object in the Eastern sky. Bright white circular light at bottom, small white light at top-bottom light went out, came back on twice, did not flash repeatedly.  Object remained stationary. It reminded me of a comet with a short,smoky tail...not a long one. I watched it as I drove 8-9 minutes...no visible movement up-down-right-left-nearer-further. If you hold your left hand on the steering wheel and raise your finger....the object was about as long as your fingernail...at whatever distance it was away. I did not see any other object. Several stars were visible in the surrounding sky. I arrived at home. I could no longer see the object for the trees.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
