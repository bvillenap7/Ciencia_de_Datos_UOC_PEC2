I have a REAL PICTURE of a UFO!!!!!!;2001-08-09 17:30:00;2 mins;I have a REAL PICTURE of a UFO!!!!!! I was standing in front of my glass sliding door looking at the sunset when I saw a metallic oval object darting back and forth in the sky.  I ran to my computer room and grabbed my digital camera in hope that I could catch it on film so I could analize it later.  I ran back into the kitchen and continued to look for the oval object.  Beyond my belief, it was still there.  I took a picture of it and that's when it dashed away.  I didn't hear any sounds nor did I see any other objects.  Afterward, I went to my computer and downloaded the photograph that I had just taken.  There it was, plain as day... a real, live UFO!!!!  I still have the picture and would love to send it to whom ever would like to have a copy!!!!!!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
A view from the airplane and a dream come true;2002-08-15 15:45:00;3 minutes;A view from the airplane and a dream come true Flying from Indianapolis to Chicago I was looking out the window. We were above the clouds. I was just enjoying the beauty of the sky and clouds when I noticed off in the horizon a silver oval, barely visable, but flying at the same speed as our plane. I leaned closer to the window across my husbands lap to get a better view. I told him to look but he could not see anything. I kept trying to point it out. He accused me of making a scene. I watched and wondered if I was seeing a UFO. I sat back and thought about it, and when I leaned over to look again I noticed another aircraft flying towards the silver oval. This other aircraft looked like it was painted in military camouflage. I tried to tell my husband again, but he was scorning the idea. The clouds began to cover my view so I could not see anymore. What makes this odd to me is this.... Earlier this year I had a dream that I was chasing some sort of aliens that were jumping and swimming along the coast. I was running along the beach with a flashlight trying to get a better look at them. I never did catch up to them. After seeing the UFO I went camping with family on the beach 2 weeks later. I heard something out in the water with headlights. I grabbed a flashlight and it was deja`vu. I was running along the beach with a flashlight chasing something that was in the water. I never did see what it was as they went out into the ocean. Some of my family say it was jetskiers, some believe, like I do, that it was aliens. K;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215

It apeared to be kind of oval shaped and white in color with a dark circle on the bottom.The incident lasted about 15 seconds when it drifted behind a tree where I couldn't see it any more.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
Acorn shaped object with light on bottom;2011-06-09 21:30:00;10 min;Acorn shaped object with light on bottom On 6/9/11, at 9:30PM, near eastside of Indianapolis, I was outside looking toward the western sky. I observed a dark acorn shaped object moving west to east slowly.  It had a large white light on the bottom that seemed to swivel or rotate. I heard no sound. I watched it move across the sky for approx. 10 minutes before I decided to go inside my workplace and get a co-worker to see it.  When I went back outside (approx. 5 min), It was gone. I feel this object was probably explainable, but interesting.;39.8067799638579;-86.1347583239215
