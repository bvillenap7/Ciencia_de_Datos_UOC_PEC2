UFO seen over Argos, IN;2000-08-01 21:00:00;1-2 Minutes;UFO seen over Argos, IN Myself and two friends were standing, grilling outdoors when I looked up and I saw what appeared to be a moving star that made some unusual flight patterns before dissapearing. It had the same color and intensity of a star. We saw it descend from the edge of the atmosphere looking towards the northeast. It moved downward for almost a minute before it turned at about 90 degrees and headed back out of the sky accelerating as it left. It looked like a ball of white light but it seemed to move in a coordinated manner. We stood ther and watched in amazement not sure of what it was that we were seeing. I am still unsure. I think that if a being or person were inside it, as it was a solid object, they would have been killed by the rapid change of direction it made. It seemed to defy gravity and to have the limitaions of flight that 'known' manmade objects possess.;41.2277;-86.2476
