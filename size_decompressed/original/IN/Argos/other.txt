Stealth Bomber shaped object at 1:00 postion of moon.Taken 5:15AM June 8,2004  ((NUFORC Note:  Bat in flight.  PD));2004-06-08 05:15:00;5min;Stealth Bomber shaped object at 1:00 postion of moon.Taken 5:15AM June 8,2004 This morning at 5:15 Am My Mother and I was waiting for the sun to come up so we could see Venus come across the sun  so while I was waiting I took some pictures of the moon. On the Right hand side of the moon at the 1 o'clock postion is an object shaped like the Stealth Bomber,only it isn't. I took the picture with a 35mm camera with a 1000mm lens set on a tripod. I had the film devoloped and after I sat the object I scanned the picture on to my computer. Once I scanned it I started zooming in on the black shape and I now have this Great shot of a UFO. What ever it is, it is  HUGE!!!! I would like to share this picture with you or someone. I know once you see my picture you will be as excited as I am. I also have another picture with a strange round thing in it. I am not sure if it is an astroid or one of Venus's Moons. I would like to share it as well. Thank you ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photo, and concluded that the anomalous object may be a small bat, with its wings swept forward in flight.  PD));41.2277;-86.2476
