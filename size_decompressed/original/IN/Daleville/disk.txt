Saucer lands on farm;1975-06-01 12:00:00;00:20;Saucer lands on farm This sighting happened many years ago when I was about 12 years old.  I have estimated the date, but know it was about lunch time that day because my mother was making lunch for us.  (I don't know if you care much for childhood memories, but I remember it like it was yesterday.)  We lived on a small farm and our nearest neighbor was about 1/4 mile down the road. I am the oldest of 6 children.  On this summer day we were all outside playing kickball.  I went back to the fence to chase down the ball when a silver flying saucer hovering over my neighbors barn caught my eye.  As soon as I saw it, three legs came out of the underside of the saucer and it floated down to the ground behind our neighbors barn where I assume it landed.  I called all of my brothers and sisters to watch, figuring it would have to take back off again.  While waiting, I ran inside to get my mother, but she dismissed me as a child making up a story and did not care to come see for herself.  I ran back to the fence where my younger brothers were getting bored and had given up on waiting to see it.  Only myself and my two oldest siblings waited long enough (about 15 - 20 minutes) when we did indeed see the craft take off again.  It raised up above the barn, retracted its legs, and shot off over the tree horizon very fast.  The craft was silver with a dome on top and was shaped like a saucer.  It was witnessed in good light during the day and with good weather. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.1295;-85.5106
