Three round, orange objects in the sky;2004-02-13 21:00:00;45 seconds;Three round, orange objects in the sky From my car I saw three round, reddish-orange spherical objects in the night sky in Flora, IN at about 9:00pm.  The first two appeared simultaneously and faded out after about 5 seconds.  A third appeared about 15 seconds after the first two and lasted for about 5 seconds as well.  All three were in different parts of the sky.  The first two appeared at my 11 o’clock and the third at my 9 o’clock.  There were no clouds in the sky at the time however there were airplanes in the area.  I don’t know if they were involved.;40.5417;-86.4979
