I read the accounts of the gentlemen from Kansas and Florida and their stories were so similar to what I had seen I felt I should tell my story. At the time I lived in Albion, Indiana and was driving over to my girlfriend's home who lived outside of LaGrange to make christmas candy. I worked with her in a factory in LaGrange for several years. It was just before Thanksgiving. I had to drive through Rome City on St. Rd 9 going north. Just before you enter the town you are on a hill and it declines as you drive into it. There is a perfect view of the horizon. I have no idea what caused me to even notice what I saw but all I know is I have never mentioned it before only to a few close relatives. I saw a metalic, silverish eggshaped object in the western astmosphere, it hovered there and didn't move. Since I was driving I tried very hard to figured out what I was seeing and to watch the road. It was a great distance from the ground and I couldn't even begin to say how far. Since I had a perfect view from east to west I saw another object that was identical in the east. Suddenly the object in the east moved at a very high rate of speed and joined the object in the west. There was no trail of vapor that comes from planes,no sound, nothing. It shot across like a laser beam to the other. But it left no trail of any kind and I know from the speed it was not a plane. Both objects then hovered together in the west and them they just took off westward and were gone! All this happened quickly and it shook me up so much that I almost stopped at the police sttion in Rome City to report what I saw and to this day I regret not doing so. I saw something that I can't explain. I have never seen anything move so quickly or looked liked these objects. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.4892;-85.3664
