A moving array of white lights illuminating sequentially.;2005-03-21 20:30:00;30 seconds;A moving array of white lights illuminating sequentially. While driving northwest on Highway 38, 2 miles southeast of Sheridan, Indiana, at exactly 8:30PM est, my girlfriend and I noticed a streaking white light shooting almost straight down. It was visible only briefly and left no trail as would a meteor. Within a few seconds, a bright white light appeared to the right and above where we saw the first light. Momentarily, another white light appeared to the right of the first one, some distance from it. Sequentially, a third light appeared equidistant from the second light, to the right, and then a fourth. As the fourth light came on, the first light went out. A fifth light came on and then the second light went out. The distance between the lights and the angle the array created would suggest a chevron shape. We stopped the car, got out to observe, but by then they had all vanished. We could not determine the altitude of the object[s] and I’m guessing it to be 2-3000 ft due to the partly cloudy skies. It did appear to be moving slowly from the west to the east. We didn’t have enough time to determine if the object blocked out any stars or clouds and couldn’t determine it’s general shape, other than that of being not quite straight across.
