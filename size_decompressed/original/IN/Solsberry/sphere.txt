Spereical object not far from Crane Naval Base Drops from the sky.;2005-03-29 19:28:00;10 minutes;Spereical object not far from Crane Naval Base Drops from the sky. Two sons of mine pointed out in the western sky, at sunset on 3/30/05* at 7:20  ((p.m.)) a dim pinkish spereical object floating along with the wind coming out of the south-west it seemed to drift with the clouds.   After ten minutes the object droped strait down with a bright magnesium white glow.  We are not that far from Crane Naval Base,  I question if it is not related to that, who knows just thought I would report it.  I and one of my sons saw the thing drop, and I have to tell you, it was cool.  *The information box would not allow me to enter the correct date*;39.119;-86.7378
