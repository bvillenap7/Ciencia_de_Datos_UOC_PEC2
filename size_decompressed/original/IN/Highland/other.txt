I saw a bright light out of the norm south southeast and seemed to be still.  Then it started flying north west which is a flight pattern I have not seen a plane fly near my house before.   The front of the craft was like a bright white light that was extremely bright in the very center and the light seemed to tail off to make a arch like shape pretty much like a U pattern but a side ways U which meant the bottom of the U would be to the left or facing North.   After the sideways U in front there was another set of white lights in the shape of a cross starting with the front light of the craft and going towards the back of the craft.   Besides the U in front and the cross there were also a bunch of extremely fast and random and the blinking lights seemed to be blue in color and then there was 4 or 5 red lights in the back in the shape of  a circle or square.                                                                                                          !
