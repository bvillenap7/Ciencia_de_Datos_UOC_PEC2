4th of July UFO;2008-07-04 21:52:00;1-2 mts.;4th of July UFO On the evening of July 4, 2008 my daughters went to their friends’ house to see the annual firework show. The show ended and they were just hanging out in the friends’ backyard. It was my two daughters, the friend and the friends’ mom that were in the backyard. My oldest daughter was sitting on the grass and noticed something in the sky, she first thought it was maybe a firework but it was moving. No later that she saw it her friend said, “is that a UFO or what?” They all were freaking out, looking at this object in the sky. My oldest described it as orange in color, a white light in front of it and green lights around the object. My oldest described it as a circular, balloon shaped object, orange in color. She could see inside the object and she described the inside was the colors, green and red, she described it like it was like when a disco ball is on, the different colors. My youngest had her digital camera that she just received on her birthday on July 2. She took it to take pictures of the fireworks but took more than fireworks that night! They both said the object was traveling from North to South. It was a 4th of July they will never forget, much better than just seeing fireworks!;41.5472;-87.4556
