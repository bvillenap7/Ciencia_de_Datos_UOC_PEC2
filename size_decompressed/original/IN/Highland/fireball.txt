Fireball seen near Chicago, IL.;2012-07-29 23:00:00;3 minutes;Fireball seen near Chicago, IL Tonight I was on my deck when I saw a very bright light moving very fast in the sky. It resembled a fireball. I first saw it in the southeast heading northwest.    At first I thought it might have been landing lights on an aircraft being diffused in the clouds.   I live close to Chicago so I see aircraft on approach all the time.   I object was higher than normal planes on approach.  T he object was also heading directly for Chicago.   All the lights on the object went out.  I could clearly see the outline of the object.  It was round possibly oval.   It began to look as it descending out of the sky.   It disappeared as the treeline further blocked its view.   I heard no sound coming from this object.   It was at an altitude where I would have heard the engines if it was an airplane.;41.5472;-87.4556
