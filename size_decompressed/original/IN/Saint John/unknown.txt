Two of my friends and I were hanging out in my garage around 1 a.m. when suddenly a blue light slowly creeped across my driveway. The light was spread across the ground about 20 feet in length and was moving towards the garage.  At first I looked to the street assuming it was car lights, but when I did not see anything in sight I quickly looked up at the sky.  As soon as I did this the blue light sort of swooped from the ground and shot of into the distance until it dissappeared from sight.  This all happened very quickly, and after the event the two others I was with saw the EXACT same thing.  There was no lightening in the sky, no storms, and no cars passing.   Have never seen anything like this before or since. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.4495;-87.4769000000001
