Aircraft in Evansville?;2014-02-11 22:30:00;5 minutes;Aircraft in evansville? I was headed to work from vincennes indiana.  Me and my car pool buddy had just got into evansville from 41 when we saw what we thought was a helicopter.   But as we got closer we noticed it was slow moving and was to big for a helicopter.  It had a bunch of lights. I saw that it was all grey with no markings.  It was a cylinder shape.  I thought maybe it was a blimp.  But I checked the news and the internet and I found nothing on a blimp being flown around evansville.   I asked around to see if any one knew of any activities going on in town but everyone I talked to said no.    It's also odd that a blimp is flying around because it's been in the negatives.     Can you help figure this out.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
