noticed a dark stationary object hanging just below the cloud base;2000-04-01 06:28:00;10 minutes;noticed a dark stationary object hanging just below the cloud base Was driving eastbound on Indiana HWY 62 going into work saturday morning approximately 0630 on 4/1/00 when i noticed a dark object with a spericial shape hanging  motionless below the cloud base,  it was totally overcast that morning. not knowing the height to the clouds can't really give estimate of size, Clouds maybe 1500 to 2500 ft and I was looking at an angle of approx 35 to 40 degrees from horizontal it appeared to be size between index finger not quite covering it to thumb covering it  color was not quite black it appeared black with respect to clouds. during the time i observed it, it did not appear to move during the  time it took me to drive4 miles and set through 4 traffic light changes, saw it  once more after turning on Houge Road through a break in the trees, pulled in the lot at work and could not get an angle on it anymore due to trees in the area, I did have a brief glimpse of it through an 8 x 25 monocular at a traffic light didnt notice anything other than that it might have been in the clouds themselves as it was a little blurred (as having a solid black object and spraying a dusting of white paint on it)  didnt notice much else at light changed and got honked at.it was totally stationary angle and position against the clouds remained the same, a plane or a helicoptor  would have showed noticable movment in the time span might have been a hot air balloon but would have been awfull early for that.  0630 on that date would have been 07:30 EST not really sure what it was, sending this in and wondering if others have reported the same object??;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
5 red orbs forming anomaly in sky, then disappearing behind clouds.;2015-05-23 23:15:00;15 minutes;5 red orbs forming anomaly in sky, then disappearing behind clouds. One red orb appears in the sky.  It was just hovering at first, then slowly disappeared behind the clouds.   Shortly after that one vanished, two more appeared coming from the west moving slowly and flashing red and orange.  These two appeared more closer than the previous one.   Finally 2 more appeared beaming down from the sky toward the others.  Then they all van. ished.   My region has an abundance of owls, they started howling as this anomaly took place.   They were not any kind of aircraft I had ever seen before.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
short series of photos shows spherical object traveling east.  (((NUFORC Note:  Possibly lens flares??  PD));2021-02-03 12:32:00;1 minute;short series of photos shows spherical object traveling east. I was taking pictures of the sky for artistic backdrops. I decided to risk phone damage and shot three pictures directly at the sun. I thought the small circle in the middle picture was a bright light anomaly  until I realized it was in all three pictures. The pictures were all shot within the same minute. The first picture shows the object just west of the sun. The second picture shows it farther east of the sun. The third picture shows it still farther east but it is partially obscured by tree branches and can only be seen while zoomed in. Had I known the object was in the pictures I would have sequenced much more thoroughly but I didnâ€™t know for a couple of days. The pictures were shot at 12:32 02/03/21. The sun was fairly low and directly south.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
