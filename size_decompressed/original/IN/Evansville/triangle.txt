It looked so out of place that I kept my eye on it as I drove towards it down the highway. It was about 5 miles away from me moving very slowly. I turned onto I 65 towards my home which would cross the path of this light.I was looking everywhere up in the sky for it until it came into full view crossing the road infront of me. It was gliding along treeline height. I was amaized but also not afraid for some reason and I flashed my lights on and off at it. Iwatched the triangular shaped object floated noiseless over the road before my  car. I then pulled into a church parking lot and got out to watch it float maybe 15 feet over the treeline. It had 3 white lights on the triangle points and one larger one in the middle. It was smokey black and did not seem to be reflecting the streetlights from the church parking lot. NO sound came from this object. It flew towards Evansville north side. After 4 or 5 minutes I could not see it anymore because it was creeping over the trees. I have never seen a UFO since but have had 3 other strange experiences which I feel are UFO related.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
Very dimly lit , low flying , silent triangular object spotted over Evansville, Indiana;2008-04-02 21:40:00;2 Minutes;Very dimly lit , low flying , silent triangular object spotted over Evansville, Indiana On the aforementioned date at the aforementioned time I was on the telephone in the 3rd floor apartment that I live in in Evansville, Indiana.  I had been talking to a friend of mine and decided to take the conversation out onto the balcony while I smoked a cigarette.   The night sky was clear and the stars were very visible.   As I spoke on the phone to my friend and smoked I looked up at the night sky because the view was spectacular.  At this time I saw a triangular shaped dimly lit object come over the apartment building and move at a steady but somewhat slow pace on a northwest trajectory.  It only seemed to be about 200 to 300 feet above the ground and not very large.  It made absolutely no sound.   I watched in astonishment and relayed what I was seeing to my friend via phone.   I then hung up and thought about what I had seen to see if there was a logical explanation.  I thought of geese because of the somewhat low flight pattern.  However in my experience here in Indiana you ALWAYS hear geese when they fly overhead. HONK HONK!   This also fails to explain the LIGHTED nature of what I had seen.  It was almost like a kite with very dimly lit lights along its edges  Possibly six if you count the point.  It was so dimly lit in fact that if not for the motion of it I may not have noticed it at all.   I called my mother in Louisiana to describe the event to her and once again as I was talking to her I scanned the skies.  It was then that I sighted movement in the northwest and saw the same object taking a nosedive downward for about 5 seconds and then once again disappear.   First time I have ever experienced a sighting of any kind in the night skies.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
Stationary Isosceles triangle, with one VERY bright light at each corner.;2012-08-10 21:00:00;1.5 hrs;Stationary Isosceles triangle, with one VERY bright light at each corner. My boyfriend and I driving home from dinner in the city, when while at a stoplight I looked up and saw a very distinguished triangle of lights in the sky West-South-West.  There was a very large area around the triangle that was pure black, no stars, no haze, no clouds.  Even in the city night sky, this triangle stood out like a sore thumb. It was an Isosceles triangle with one light at each corner.  The “triangle” was stationary and did not move through the sky.  While we were commuting the 20 minutes it took for us to get home in the country, my boyfriend kept his eye on the “triangle”.  The lights were brighter than any stars that were in the sky, and the lights were also larger than any stars in the sky. Once we got home we walked down the road to get a clearer look across a field.   While the lights at each corner of the triangle were very bright, we were not able to capture the lights on camera.   We tried using the cameras on our cell phones, and our digital camera, but the triangle would not show up.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
