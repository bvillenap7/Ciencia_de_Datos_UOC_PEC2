It was like seeing a fleet of plates all grey except for the lights flying through the air.;2001-04-13 02:37:00;side ways;It was like seeing a fleet of plates all grey except for the lights flying through the air. We seen the visitors real early in the morning.they were standing their for about 20seconds then they took off toward the north. They had many lights on the bottom that were a redish color and turned gren when they left. They had many wierd looking sins that were in the shape o a spiral that led into the center which constintly opened and closed.But they were very quiet except when one point whn it dropped about a few hundred feet but that only sounded like a jet way far in the distance.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
((HOAX??))  Debunk This.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax.  Date is flawed, and contact information is wrong.  PD));2013-11-24 18:00:00;1-2 minutes;Debunk This. So I clicked Disk or Saucer, but this looked almost as if there were one plane in front and one following close behind it carrying something in between.   It appeared to be linear and have a flashing light on each end.   I can't identify it, therefore I'm reporting it as a U.F.O.. I was on the westside of Evansville, at ALDI, looking east standing parallel to the Lloyd Expressway.   I could only follow it for 1-2 minutes and it either was too cloudy or it vanished.

I had let my German Shepherd out and heard him barking repeatedly and as I walked outside I noticed two disc shapes hovering close by.;2015-12-28 02:00:00;5 minutes;I had let my German Shepherd out and heard him barking repeatedly, and as I walked outside, I noticed two disc shapes hovering close by at least 25 yards from my house, and one started to circle where I was at.   My dog was growling didn't hear no sounds and I know that these were no military aircraft as being a Marine veteran I know my crafts.  It was disturbing I did walk back in directing my German Shepherd to follow me in.   Strange enough...thought I had seen something move in yard and was ready with side arm crazy thing is that I see them all the time.

Eighteen crafts appeared in the sky, moved very slowly, and then disappeared in about 5 min..  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2017-08-21 11:15:00;5 minutes;Eighteen crafts appeared in the sky, moved very slowly, and then disappeared in about five minutes. The crafts were large and disk like.  All were bright and had a silver-ish color.  Some had blinking orange lights.  I could hear a low toned humming.  I counted 18, but there could have been more.  Some family and friends saw this.  I didn't see them appear, but when they left it was like they vanished.  Just popped out of existence.  I could see them very well.   Also, all of the gas in our cars started leaking out.  My watch stopped.  Camera photos became over exposed;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
