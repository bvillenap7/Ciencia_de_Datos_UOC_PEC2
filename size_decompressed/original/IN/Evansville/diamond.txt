I was looking to the west-northwest. I saw a single, bright, amber-colored diamond shaped object in the sky to the west-northwest of Evansville. The object, when it caught my eye, was about the size of my thumbnail at arm's length. The object immediately seemed to shrink in size until it could not be seen at all. Time to shrink was about 10 seconds. There was no horizontal or vertical movement to the object. It was appx. 30 degrees above the horizon. I have a habit of looking into the night sky as I walk to my front door to see what celestial objects are visible that night. I first thought it to be a planet or very bright star... until it disappeared. It was then I realized that the sky was completely overcast. The object was in the normal flight path for departing aircraft from EVV, but I saw no other lights or beacons or lateral movement that would indicate an aircraft. I have no approximation at all for distance to the object. I watched for a few minutes afterward with no other activity in that area of the sky. It may be nothing, but I thought I should report in case I wasn't the only one to have seen this object.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
