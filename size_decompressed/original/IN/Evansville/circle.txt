Three orange lights make a triangle over east side of Evansville, IN.;2014-02-28 20:35:00;4 minutes;Three orange lights make a triangle over east side of Evansville, IN. My father and I were coming home from him picking me up from work.  We pulled into our driveway when I looked over the slant of my rooftop.  In the sky there was a weird triangle.  It wasn't a full triangle, but on each of the three points there was an orange/red/amber light. It seemed to keep a perfect triangular shape.  I was losing my mind while my dad told me to stay in the car.  Immediately, he does the most stereotypical thing and pulls out his phone.  He starts to record it but forgets to press the actual record button, of course.  I was on the verge of tears because I did not know what was going on.  The triangle moves to the left in the sky and the top point and bottom left point start to move straight out to the left while the right one stays.  The two immediately make a curved path and disappear into the clouds.  The third one stays behind a little and then after about a minute starts to float away.  We waited a few more minutes to see what else would happen but nothing did. We knew that it wasn't a plane, helicopter, or drone.  This was something unreal it seemed.  We thought we were crazy but we knew what had happened even if our minds didn't want to believe it.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
Fire in the sky.;2014-07-18 21:00:00;10 minutes;Fire in the sky. From  my apartment you could see a round shape object that kept disappearing and reappearing. It was heading west going passed Green River Road and Washington Avenue.  There was no sound and I have taken several pictures of this very strange craft.  I know that it wasn't any air craft we have.  It was doing things that our air craft cannot do. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Object very stealthy and moved like a falling leaf.  ((MUFON report));2014-08-02 23:10:00;Several minutes;Object very stealthy and moved like a falling leaf. A young couple were driving home when all of a sudden up ahead just above the tree line they both observed a very unusual bright orange fluorescent light which was moving slowly across the sky N-S and right towards them.  Overwhelmed they pulled over and observed the object float by.  They heard no sound and the object was very stealth and moved like a falling leaf,  The center was almost too bright to look at as the object past very close to them, It was large and perfectly round and symmetrical,  They noticed the object's path take a couple noticeable directional changes as they observed it for several minutes.  The object ascended to the south and disappeared in the night sky. (MUFON 58602);38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313

Blue and white streak with tail traveling in NE sky that disappeared then followed by a blue circular shape with a white ring twice.;2016-02-19 20:43:00;5 seconds;Blue and white streak with tail traveling in NE sky that disappeared then followed by a blue circular shape with a white ring twice. While traveling North on I-69 at approximately mile marker 17, I saw a blue and white streak traveling across the NE sky.  The streak had a tail like a comet.   A second after the streak disappeared, a blue circle with a white ring flashed in the horizon at 3:00 positions in the sky for 1 or 2 seconds.  Then above the tree tops approximately one second later the blue circle with white ring appeared again for one second.  All three images occurred within a 6 to 10 seconds.   The sky was clear but the blue and white circle flashes appeared to have smoke or a cloud around the light...light exhaust.   This occurred at 8:43 Central Time.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313

Numerous objects, one having a rectagular protrusion on a disk-like structure, animal reaction.. ((MUFON report));2018-09-14 03:00:00;Several minutes;Numerous objects, one having a rectagular protrusion on a disk-like structure, animal reaction Witness was at work on the city's east side not far from hwy 41 when he noticed a bright orange light to the east through an open garage door he was working close to.  He estimated it was at least 10 to 15 miles away, but the height was hard to judge.  If you stuck your arm straight out, it would have been less than a fingers width away from a tree line that was over a mile away.  Probably hundreds of feet from the ground.  The light was definitely lower and brighter than any star in the sky that he had ever seen.  It was also brighter than a passenger plane flying not quite overhead of where he was, and larger.  His first thought was that it was a helicopter with a search light, since it seemed to be stationary, and he figured a bright search light may explain why it looked so big.  He watched it for around 3 minutes before he had to walk away for about 10 seconds, and when he returned to see what it was doing it had vanished.  He watched for maybe another! minute and it still hadn't returned.  That's when he thought maybe it was a UFO.  He went to tell a co-worker about it and took care of a few things which took about 10 minutes and went to look again and there was another orange light.  This time it was off to the left a bit and a little higher. I would say at least a mile north of the first light.  My co-worker was close by so I called him over to see it.  They talked for a couple of minutes about it while they watched it and then it just disappeared.  It was like someone just flipped a switch and it was gone.  After another 15 minutes or so he went back to look and another light appeared while he was watching in the same place the first one was, except this time it was a deep red.  Then this one started ascending higher into the sky very slowly, and after it moved about an inch or so from his perspective, it kind of changed colors back to orange.  It stopped after another inch or so and stayed there for several minutes before disappearing.  He had forgot to mention that between the first and second light he had seen an object fly from the direction of the lights toward and straight over him to the west.  It didn't appear to have any lights.  It looked like it was reflecting the lights from the city.  It looked grayish and maybe triangular.  It was moving almost as fast as a meteor and over twice as fast as a plane.  It was probably several hundred feet from the ground.  After the third light he witnessed, he and his co-worker were standing at the garage door when he saw a light that appeared even further in the distance than the original lights.  Then a second light appeared to the south and another appeared to the north.  All three were slowly moving up and down and changing the intensity of their light.  Eventually they disappeared one at a time.  Then about 15 or 20 minutes later he was looking again and saw a bright red light blinking very rapidly in the distance for about 10 seconds.  All of these lights were definitely hundreds of feet in the air, bri! ghter and larger than any aircraft he had ever seen, moved in ways that he had never seen a regular airplane move, and were not stars or radio towers.  He wasn't able to take pictures because it was night and the distances, and there were street lights in the foreground screwing with the focus.  Also, the sighting didn't really make me feel any certain way but it did give me good bumps.  (MUFON CMS);38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
10-12 satellites? in formation 10 degrees apart easterly.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-03-29 20:35:00;5 minutes;10-12 satellites? in formation 10 degrees apart easterly I was attempting to spot comet Atlas in between Ursa Major and Cassiopeia at around 2035 hrs on 03/29 with Nikon Monarch binocs.  While observing Ursa and visually tracking towards Cass, I noticed, what i thought was an ordinary satellite, very common.  Arms fatigued, I dropped, and looked up.  I noticed another satellite moving on the same path at about 10 degrees.  I have been watching the skys for 30 years, it raised a flag.  I soon noticed more satellites following the same path at the same speed, at satellite speed, at approx 10 degrees apart.  I notified my wife, she came out of the house and witnessed the same objects moving easterly at the same speed in the same position, and from what we could tell, the same distance apart.  I witnessed about 10 to 12 objects.  Interesting, we noticed a satellite moving southerly on the left side of Ursa close to 90 degrees after the group past. Visually, it looked like satellites, through binocs, small orange dots reflecting from a setting sun below horizon.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
