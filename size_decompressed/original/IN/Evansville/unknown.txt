Bright Bold Primary Colored Lights in the Sky BUT no shape of a craft.;1995-10-15 22:00:00;4 minutes;Bright Bold Primary Colored Lights in the Sky BUT no shape of a craft. This all happened when I was on my way back to my parents house from dropping off a rented movie. My parents live outside the city limits.  I was almost all the way home when I drove out of a clearing of trees when I spotted the primary colored lights in the sky.  As I approached the lights I slowed my car to a halt.  I was nearly underneath the lights.  It was a clear and cool evening.  I turned my car engine off to listen for any engine noises. there was no noise coming from the lights which were to my guess about 150 foot up in the sky.  I can judge this by the 50 foot tree that was near.  The lights were very large circular and were in groups of primary colors of red, yellow, and blue.  I left my parking lights on and flashed my headlights at the colored lights and the colored lights began to slowly fade and brighted but in a pattern of the grouping of the colored lights.  I rolled down my window and got out of my car and shut the door.  I continued to flasth the lights for a few more moments.  I was startled when I heard an older couple in a luxury car slowly approach from behind me.  I heard the lady in the passenger seat say to her husband What is that? and I noticed her red painted fingernair pointing up at what I was seeing.  The couple being frightened drove off rather quickly.  I tried for the life of me to get a shape of a craft of a length or color of one and I could not see any lines or shape.  The lights which were in perfect focus and were not the little twinkly lights a person would see on a plane or helicoper far away were easy to see.  The thing that puzzles me to this day is why I could not make out a shape of a craft.  I looked near the colored lights and far away from them as to see if I was not looking far enough out.  I believe there was only one craft because the lights must have got bored with my light flashing and slowly turned clockwise together and then slowly went in a direction to my right.  Because there were no immidiate roads to chase it I did not chase it.  I then w! ent home which was only a few hundred feet from the sighting and told my parents about it.  They believed me mainly because I was brought up not to cry wolf and they knew I would not do such a thing.  If someone feels that they need to contact me for more information about the sighting please feel free to contact me at ((address deleted)) and ask for ((name deleted)).  I am not afraid of what people think and only want to let people know what I saw.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313

At that time somethuing appeared just behind the plane, yet lowere than the plane was.  Luckily I had my video camera and caught it on tape!  You tell me what it was it definately wasn't a plane. Not a plane I've ever seen anyway! Can You tell me who might be interested in purchasing this video footage.  You can tell by my daughter this was a weird mishalf, it even frightened her! I had a camera in one hand, fishin pole in the other and 6 year old daughter holding on tight to my left leg! spotted a Unidentified I will send a COPY of this Video Tape provided I have assurance it will not be duplicated, and not used for any nature other than to check its authenticity.  This includes scientific research!  They can afford to pay this poor old Evansville Boy something for this footage.  After watching the video in slow-motion it appears to manuver in an odd fashion.  Directly after my daughter saying it might be another plane, I say it might be a UFO. Still pause tape there run the tape in slow-mo and watch what you see! Is that strange or what? I don't know of any planes moving like that. Hell, there isn't even a Airforce Base anywhere that close! This was on a bright, clear sunshiney day! My daughter explains what shape she thought it looked like at the end. I will send the tape upon verification to use only as directed.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
Two small craft with a sequence of red lights made an instantaeous 90 degree turn to follow a commercial aircraft.;2008-11-18 17:25:00;5 minutes;Two small craft with a sequence of red lights made an instantaeous 90 degree turn to follow a commercial aircraft. A clearly identifiable commercial aircraft was flying to the north east over the campus of the University of Southern Indiana.  Two smaller craft of unidentifable shape but blinking with red and white lights were heading towards the north west. They were flying in formation - one was closely following the other. Initially, I presumed they were military jets, but I could only hear the noise of one aircraft engine. When they reached the spot where they bisected the flight path of the commercial aircraft, both smaller craft immediately turned at a 90-degree angle and began following the commercial jet. These smaller craft did not bank, as airplanes would do - they simply changed directions in an instant. Once they changed direction, they also changed color.  Instead of blinking red and white, they were blinking red only. Further, the location of the lights changed as well. Instead of appearing to be on either side of the craft, a series of red lights blinked in sequence as if along the side of a circular craft.  At this point, two additional craft appeared they were even smaller than the initial two and they blinked with only white lights.  They flew near the initial group for a few seconds, then they flew off rapidly in two different directions (one to the southwest, the other to the northeast). The commercial aircraft and its companions were ultimately lost to sight, continuing to head southeast.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313

15 to 20 red/orange glowing objects soundlessly following one another across sky from NW to NE, a few seconds to a minute apart;2013-08-17 20:30:00;10-15 minutes;15 to 20 red/orange glowing objects soundlessly following one another across sky from NW to NE, a few seconds to a minute apart On August 14, 2013, around 8:30 p.m. CDT, my husband and I and two friends were standing in our friends' driveway in Evansville, Indiana, when we all noticed a glowing red/orange object in the sky, crossing from northwest to northeast.  It made no sound and did not have the three lights one usually sees on an airplane.   Several seconds later, another appeared in the northwest and followed the same path to the northeast.  As we watched for ten or 15 minutes, we saw at least 15 to 20 of these glowing objects following the same path at varying distances.  They did not appear to be at as high an altitude as an airliner travels, but they were high enough that it was impossible to positively determine a shape.  (One still snapshot taken by my husband with a telephoto lens suggested a triangular shape, red with some yellow lights on it, but I hesitate to say that that was its actual shape, due to the movement.) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) This is a correction to the description submitted a few minutes ago.  The direction of travel of the objects sighted was NW to SW (not NW to NE as reported earlier).  Sorry for my error. ((END ADDENDUM));38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313

Funny thing is, that night I had a dream about multiple yellowish orbs flying past my house and some would stop for a moment then would continue circling around.  Also, when I woke up I found myself laying on the other side of my bed. Another thing is that I got a fortune from a fortune cookie that said, You will have a close encounter of the surprising kind.  I also had another dream some months later, but this time it was a black rectangular craft and one bulbous looking craft that had two engines in the back glowing a light blue.... For all I know is that this was all real...;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313

I was on the bus to school one morning and above this small building like substation or antennae (don't know how describe building) and there was 2 orb like craft (possibly). After my bus went down the road the craft then flew off silently into the forest.  As it was flying away it seemed to be connected.

I was looking at the ground checking on the dog when I see a white orb flash and suddenly disappear.  I begin searching for the craft but I can’t see it.  Then it reappears in the distance.  This craft was blinking in and out of sight suggesting it was using some kind of stealth cloaking technology.  I see it go into the distance reappearing and disappearing.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
