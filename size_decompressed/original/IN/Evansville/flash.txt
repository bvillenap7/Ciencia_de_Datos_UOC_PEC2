I was outside taking my dog out and was looking at the first star as it was starting to get dark. All of a sudden I see a bright white flash about airliner height.

Followed by another about from my perspective 3ft from one another way far away. It looked like a star winked 2x but never seen the blink come back until about 10seconds later it looked as if a small rocket launched from the area of the wings and was green in color followed by a glowing tail of light and then disappeared within seconds and never saw another blink or star appear it was just nothing. The strangest thing I have encountered in a while.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
