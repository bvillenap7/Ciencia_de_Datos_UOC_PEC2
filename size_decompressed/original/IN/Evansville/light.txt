I was sound alseep and suddenly awoke to a red light coming in through the blinds.  The light was very bright, like fire.  At first I thought the apartment building next door was on fire, then I felt a static electric feeling and the red light covered my body moving from my feet upwards toward my head.  I was paralyzed and could hardly breathe.  It seemed to last forever, but it was really only a few seconds.  After the light got to my scalp it left and the window was dark again.  I was terrified, so I called a friend. I was crying and shaking.  My friend told me it was just a street lamp shining in or the brakes on a car. I was on the second floor of a building that was facing another building.  I was at the end of the building farthest from the road.  I insisted that it wasn't a light from the street, the red light was angled from above my window.  She said that it was just a dream and I was stressed because mid-terms was coming up.  I have never forgotten this light that scanned my body or the feeling that went with it.   Since that time I have had terrible nightmares of something swooping down from the cieling at me.  When I awake from these dreams, I am usually yelling at them and the swooping things have taken on the form of an object in the room.  I don't remember having any different marks or anything after the light came in, but I started remembering events that I had never remembered before about childhood abuse.   I'm not sure the memories are real, but the feelings that go along with them are very real.  Has anyone else ever experienced anything similar.  I've not told anyone about this incident, other than my friend, because no one would beleive me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

At approximately 10:45 p.m. on June 22, my fiancee and I both noticed a strange speck of light as we stood on the ledge of our second story apartment.  The light behaved in a bizarre fashion, moving at what seemed to be incredible speeds in a zigzag motion back and forth.  It would disappear into some trees for a moment then reappear.  The entire episode lasted until 10:50. In are attempt to give this moment a rational explanation we both ruled out the following: The object did not appear to be any type of aircraft due to it's bizarre flying behavior, nor was it a search light because there was no ground source projecting it. I am writing this to the National UFO Reporting Center in the hopes that there may have been others that had witnessed this strange event.  It may be possible that the object was picked up on radar at our local air port though I could not obtain that information at this time. Whatever it was it has defiantly spooked both of us into thinking that much of the stuff we see on TV may not be figments of the imagination.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313

I noticed a small group of stars and was just admiring them. There was 3 in a sort of one sided diamond shape when I noticed one start to move in a northern direction. It moved at a steady but slow pace. I watched the thing go north till the horizon obscured the view. The entire instance lasted about 1 minute.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
confirm coast to coast caller Sullivan Indiana;2003-10-13 01:00:00;10min;confirm coast to coast caller Sullivan Indiana During your Coast to Coast show right after the Mooreshead guest left a man called in from Sullivan IN.  He claimed to watch a light for 45 minutes with it moving very little.  Military jets followed behind.  I work in Evansville right off of HWY41 (only a field is between my DC and hwy 41)It only takes me approx 16mins to get home from work at night.  I listen to c2c on the way home and have often said dang I never see anything.  I travel east from HWY 41 down Lynch Rd toward I-64. 3 blocks from work there is very little artifical light and open fields so I have a clear view of the night sky for miles and miles.  There is an Airport (evansville regional) north less than 10 miles.  Starting in October I've noticed a bright light in the direction I'm traveling  just a degree or so south of Lynch Road. I note this cause like the other man I see it a long time and it only seems to move left and right slightly.  I spectulated as to what it was ..something traveling toward me?  A balloon? Mars?  A Star?  Lynch road was built up to the I-64 bypass and there it ends uphill into farmland.  If Lynch was 12o'clock then the light was at 1:30am.  It glowed and shimmered like heat on blacktop. From 2 miles away it was just smaller than a dime. (I held one up) Seeing it as I traveled it seemed not natural or right. There was only one big light as if it were a tiny star hovering over a field I could see a silo slightly North of it.  I watched it more than I watch the road. I was driving straight toward it trying to see it but I couldnt actually focus on it. I thought I could make out a shape in the glow cause I was kinda making a joke about it to myself ..here's my c2c call! I was thinking how could I descibe it to Art Bell. Round bright slightly shimmering light seeming to cover something not quite circular. I entered the I-64 ramp but I stopped trying to see it better it never moved.  I couldnt focus good on it beyond the light so I continued on I-64 traveling south toward Indiana 66...looking left at the light it suddenly blinks out. well I thought whatever it is it's gone.  At that moment  large heavy duty helicopters flew over there were 3 of them in formation traveling Southeast in a straight line toward where ALCOA sits on the Ohio River. Of course I'm thinking wow..this was an Art Bell moment.  I had that same moment for the next 5 weeks either on wens or thursday nights.  Big light...Military choppers. I know that Indiana has military bases and Kentucky has them too.  It's not heard of but not too common for those big choppers to travel over us.  I was wondering if a map was out is Sulliivan/Evansville-Newburgh/Moorehead in a light with each other? I havent seen the light or military aircraft since right before thanksgiving.  There are all kinds of Natural caves in these area's plenty of hidey holes!;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313

It was about 1500ft. up and appeared to be descending slightly as it moved into some clouds and disappeared.  The entire sighting only lasted a couple of seconds. I rolled down my window to get a better look and to listen for any sound (possibly from an airplane) there was none. Thinking it might have been an airplane anyway since our airport is only 7 miles from where I was, I drove by the airport to see  if any planes had landed recently but from my observations none had.  Besides, the approach for this craft would have been all wrong to land at our airport. I am a family man in my late thirties with a college degree.

No sound accompanied the light, living in the country we often hear the sound of a jet as it passes.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
Orange Light Flying Over Evansville, Indiana!;2011-06-29 02:15:00;1 minute;Orange Light Flying Over Evansville, Indiana! Early on the morning of June 29th, my mother yelled for me to come look outside at the thing on fire in the sky.   I rushed outside to see what it was and here is what I saw:  A bright orange light, literally looked as if it could’ve been an object on fire.   Flying at about a 45-degree angle from where I was standing.  The object was traveling, from the best that I could gather, from northeast to southwest.   It did not make any noise that I could hear and was flying relatively fast until it disappeared into the distance toward Henderson, Kentucky.  In size comparisons, the object was about 5 times the size of a star in the night sky. I will be the first to admit that I honestly have no idea what I saw.  I’ve never seen anything like it, and neither of my parents who witnessed the whole account had either.   I just wanted to report this to hopefully get an idea of what we witnessed that night.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313

It flickered in different colors consisting of red, blue, and white. It also disappeared for a split second and then kept flashing.  It disappeared like that a few times.

Two lights over Evansville, IN early in the morning;2012-01-10 03:30:00;90 seconds;Two lights over Evansville, IN early in the morning I went outside to smoke a cigarette when I notice a bright light in the eastern sky. At first I thought it was a star or planet such a Venus or something, however, I noticed it slowly moving in the South East direction. The first light to catch my attention was brighter than Venus on a clear evening. It was following another dimmer light. There were no sounds from them and they appeared to be far off in the distance. I watched them make their way across the night sky. Both objects moving in the same direction keeping the same amount of distance between them. The faded as the reached the horizon line. I live near an airport and I'm used to seeing objects in the sky, however, these two objects acted differently. I wouldn't have thought anything of it if there hadn't been two of them. The first one I saw dimmed quicker than the one leading the two lights. I've never seen aircraft do this, they have flight patterns and generally there are no flights out of our a! irport this late. I don't believe it was a helicopter because they usually fly solo. This was different.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313

We witnessed 6 or 7 red lights traveling low to the ground off in the distance.  These lights were evenly spaced apart and seemed to be taking off from the ground and launching in succession.  They were north of us and traveling towards the west.  They were too far away to hear any sound, but were following each other, one after another after another.  It was unlike anything any of us had ever seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
15-20 supposed aircraft seen flying in sky traveling from East to Southwest with several red/orange lights (not blinking) and no noise.;2014-07-04 22:30:00;15-25 minutes;15-20 supposed aircraft seen flying in sky traveling from East to Southwest with several red/orange lights (not blinking) and no noise. On July 4th, 2014, at approximately 9:30 to 10:00 p.m., my husband and I walked the dog down the driveway to the street in front of our house to show her some fireworks which the neighbors all around us were setting off.   We did this in order to ease her panic about the noise.   We suddenly looked up in the eastern sky and saw two crafts emerge from behind a tall tree which appeared to us like small airplanes with several red/orange lights in a parallel formation to the ground on each craft.  We did not hear any aircraft noise, as we were familiar with small aircraft noise due to my neighbor building and flying his own planes – sometimes coming over our houses in the neighborhood.   After these two emerged, they traveled southwest and went behind another tree.  They appeared to be flying fairly low, at about the same height and speed of a small aircraft.  Then two more emerged, flying in the same direction.   I would say that at least 8 appeared (in pairs) coming from behind the trees and flew in the same direction as the others, but as they flew on, they appeared to rise some and disappeared before our eyes.   At that time, we looked back at the first tree, and they were still coming, sometimes alone and sometimes in twos.  When they flew in twos, one flew directly over the other craft.  We watched as they all flew to the southwest and disappeared before our eyes.    A friend on facebook said they saw the red lights as well while they were outside with their family in another part of town.  However, only two miles away, a couple with which we are close, said they saw three of them heading directly west.   The husband of this couple was a Vietnam vet and an Iraq vet and was familiar with aircraft.  He alerted his wife to come see the strange lights before they disappeared.  Some family members thought they were “lanterns” due to the popularity of same.  However, I googled all types of lanterns and balloons, and none of them had any similarities to what we saw.  These things were not floating, but traveling with precision and each of them–nearly 15 to 20 in all–had approx. 3 red/orange lights on the crafts, and we never saw any blinking like air crafts (or noise as I stated above).   They were very unusual.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
3 Bright Orange balls of light keeping the same path.;2014-07-04 23:00:00;5 minutes;3 Bright Orange balls of light keeping the same path My husband and I were out for a walk and we just saw 3 orange balls of light coming in from the east and moving to the west.   They were separate from each other but seemed to follow the same path as the other.  The were very orange.  They did not flash.   They started off low to the sky then as they went further to the west they seemed to get higher before completely disappearing.   They did not make any sound as they passed like a helicopter or a private plane would have.   We live in a city with an airport and are very familiar with what a plane looks like. These were NOT planes.   I understand that this is the forth of July, however, we do know the difference between something flying in the sky versus a firework.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
Six red lights moving north to south then disappearing straight up. Made no sound.;2015-04-17 22:30:00;20 minutes;Six red lights moving north to south then disappearing straight up. Made no sound. Between 10 and 11 PM on April 17, 2015, I was in front of my house walking my dogs.  I observed a red light in the sky coming from the north.  Since we are near the Evansville, Indiana, airport, I thought it was a plane preparing to land.  When it was almost to my location a second red light appeared along the same general path.   At this point the first light appeared to most straight up at a rapid pace and disappeared into the sky.  The second light followed suit.  Then two more lights appeared a repeated the performance.  They were followed by two more.   At no time could I detect the sound of an engine of any kind.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313

around 12:10 pm Central standard time at latitude 37.97 longitude -87.49  Orion constellation, the two shoulders, the belt of all three;2019-11-09 00:10:00;~30 minutes;around 12:10 pm Central standard time at latitude 37.97 longitude -87.49  Orion constellation, the two shoulders, the belt of all three stars, and the two legs (7 stars) and one almost directly down if Orion were straight up all appeared to me in overcast skies. My friend Mr. T (names kept anonymous for protection) was a witness as parts of the constellation showed themselves and then disappeared, especially the star Rigel, which moved and shifted color across the spectrum while being seen by both he and I. Using a $900 pair of night vision goggles I have seen a set of two very hot very columns coming off two lower sides of the craft  When I describe them as “showing themselves” I mean that on a very bright night in the middle of a city while overcast with scattered altocumulus clouds, these objects appeared to me with the brightness of a shooting star while not moving except for abnormal jaunts to nearby static positions. While moving, they changed in brightness by magnitudes that could not be accounted for by the clouds moving.  With Rigel in clear appearance when I showed tom, the entirety of the constellation became the brightest thing in the entire sky along with the one other star under orion.  Same location at 12:23 pm I placed a call to vanderburgh dispatch and told them about the appearance, they recommended to me a call center for ufocenter.com at 206 722 3000  At 12:25 I placed the call and the director Mr. Davenport took my call. He suggested documenting my experience in writing and asked if I have a camera I have a Sony A7R3. it’s a world class mirrorless camera with in body stabilization. Without much time to waste I went back outside at the end of our call with the camera and a fixed focal length (prime) lens at 28 millimeters. I picked this lens because prime lenses are incredibly sharp and it was already on the camera. I fixed the focus on these objects after setting the aperture wide open and started taking a number of pictures at a high ISO (around 6400?) and aperture. Noticing they were noisy even though the camera was on a tripod, I checked the exposure time and automatic settings had pushed the exposure time to 1/6th of a second. I set the iso first to 100 and began taking a number of long exposure photographs (10, 8 seconds). I noticed in one image a “star trail” on one of the objects. It was straight, not an arc, and ! the end of the trail was very bright as though the craft or object had moved and then become stationary. I have done astrophotography with lenses like this one in the past and star trails aren’t distinguishable near this altitude without a 15 second exposure. I set the iso higher to 640 and started taking a number of photographs across the sky at about a second long exposure. As a part of this report I will upload them.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
I see possibly two of the same craft that landed on Maxwell Avenue;2020-09-10 20:30:00;10-15 minutes;I see possibly two of the same craft that landed on Maxwell Avenue 8:30PM CST Me and my father are returning home via highway 41 after church band practice and we see two white/light blue lights side by side hovering in the air and slowly moving to the north.  As we are going down 41 I say, “Look at that plane.”  At this point I was thinking it was a plane but I’m still unsure about it because of how bright the lights were.  At this same time I spot the craft I see a plane with landing lights on and navigation lights on coming in for a landing at EVV airport.  My dad replies, “That’s a UFO.”  Then I reply back saying, “Well... how would you know?”  He then replies jokingly, “Because that’s my mothership.” and we both laugh.  As I look at the craft again it is now slowly moving south (I couldn’t tell because the craft had now moved above the down town section of Evansville.  This craft either moved incredibly fast or there were two of these craft. Still to this day I question if my father has had experiences that he just doesn’t wish to share. I remember one morning my dad said to me that I was “genetically modified”.  Was he just joking?  Or does he know about the connection that our bloodline possess?  Someday I will question him about it.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
