However, the object although distant, had multicolor. We decided to follow it. After trying get close, meaning at 10 miles away, the object was then seen in the opposite direction. We follow it. At home we film it with a digital camera. The interesting thing about object is that it had a periodic burst of blue light like fireworks. We zoom on the object with a tripod and the object appeared to be moving to right the camera. At about 400x enhancment the documented on film was well defined. ((NUFORC Note:  The report seems to us to be not inconsistent with a planet or twinkling star.  PD));38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
Brilliant reddsh orange fireball  moving silently from north to south over Evansville Indiana.;2011-08-27 23:15:00;25 seconds;Brilliant reddsh orange fireball  moving silently from north to south over Evansville Indiana. While visiting with friends on their front porch, all four of us witnessed an extremely bright reddish-orange flair-like ball of light traveling from north to south.  The brightness and color of the object was what first caught my attention.  It was brighter than an aircraft landing light would be if the aircraft was moving directly toward the observer.  This object was moving from directly overhead of us when first noticed, to due south, until it flickered a few times and disappeared approximately 45 degrees above the southern horizon. The color was a brilliant red-orange and never faded or lost intensity as it moved away from us.  The object was silent.  The color and brightness was absolutely striking. I live two miles from the airport and landing aircraft pass directly over my home several times per day.  I am very familiar with landing aircraft and this was not an aircraft.   I also enjoy amateur astronomy and seldom miss an ISS flyby or a meteor showe! r.  This was not a meteor or satellite. The comparable size of the object was approximately that of a large aspirin tablet held at arms length.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
