Our family had gone to bed for the night, when my daughter entered my bedroom and expressed concerned over an outside light that was;2003-08-28 23:30:00;2-3 minutes;This event was witnessed by myself and my 16 yr old daughter. We do not know if it was UFO related. Our family had gone to bed for the night, when my daughter entered my bedroom and expressed concerned over an outside light that was visible through the mini-blinds covering her bedroom window. I entered her room and without opening the blinds, could see what would best be described as a strobe-like light. The angle of my view would not allow me to see the actual source of the light. We could only see the strobe effect within the beam. The beam diffusion was such that the light source must have been coming from above the window. We watched it together for about a minute. Then we decided to go outside to find out what it may be. The time lapse to go from the bedroom to outside was no more than a minute. Once outside, we found nothing. No light source, nothing. We live in a rural area and our residence is situated higher than the road we live on so I can probably rule out any car source. There are no street lights in our area. When it's nightime, it's dark here. I cannot explain or comprehend what my daughter and I witnessed.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313

Four pairs of orbs went W-E in 6 mins then turned SE. Cell phone images or video. ((anonymous report));2018-01-27 18:08:00;6 minutes;Four pairs of orbs went W-E in 6 mins then turned SE.  Cell phone images or video.  Story appeared in local paper and on TV.  Jet described as military was taking same path but local radar showed only a commercial jet at 37,000'.  These objects traveled 15 mi in 6 mins in 4 prs, so this would be very fast, too fast for jackolanterns which would take 15-20 for each pair.  Was investigated by colleague for the MADAR Center at Newburgh.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
Two orbs land on Maxwell Avenue...;2019-01-14 06:50:00;20 - 25 minutes;Two orbs land on Maxwell Avenue... I was 16 when I saw this craft.  It has been a little over a year since I’ve seen the craft.  But the odd thing is is that this was not the first time this craft was seen.  But those other accounts are for other reports.  6:30 AM CST  I am waiting at the stop where my bus picks me up for school.  Since I live near an airport it isn’t too uncommon to see some General Aviation craft fly in and out of the EVV airport.  At first I thought I was looking at a Cessna because the lights (or at the time I thought were lights) were positioned in the exact same layout as a Cessna’s wing lights.  But as I look closer I see no wings, no landing lights, and no navigation lights. When I suddenly notice that this is not a plane the craft comes to a complete stop over Maxwell Avenue, the road that connects Oak Hill road to Weinbach.  I keep my eyes on the craft. My bus arrives and I get in. I look outside of the windows to get a look at the craft as the bus now travels Northbound on Oak Hill but the craft is gone. My bus goes down Trail Drive and loops around it so it can go southbound towards Maxwell Avenue for the next stop. My bus continues it’s route. A buddy of mine gets on. We greet each other and he sits down next to ! me. My bus continues down towards Maxwell Avenue and then turns to go Eastbound on Maxwell. As I look out the windshield of the bus I see the craft landed on the ground or hovering over it slightly bobbing up and down. I was in total shock to see it sitting there and no one else noticing it! I guess to other people the two orbs looked like headlights of a vehicle sitting outside of this radio relay that sits on the right to Eastbound Maxwell Avenue. The craft stays where it is for a few seconds and then takes off going towards the Pigeon creek to the West. I look over at my friend and say, “Did you see that?” “No. What was it?” I jokingly say, “It was probably a drone.” And we laugh about it.  But now I realize after this incident that this craft was looking for something. It was possibly looking for me because earlier that school year in August of 2018 I was abducted. For all I know I’m part of something big going on behind the scenes out beyond our sphere of influence here on earth. For all I know this craft has been dispatched to spy on me as did another craft earlier this year in my report on 1/07/2020. And on that night that craft an hour later made MADAR node 153 here in Evansville go into alert status.  I will post the other reports on these 2 orbs. They seem to be only around in this area and are interested in something here.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
