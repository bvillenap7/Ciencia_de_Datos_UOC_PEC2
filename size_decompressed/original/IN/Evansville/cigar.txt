No car present. Immediately looked up and heard a whoosh, or something cutting through the wind, like a hang-glider-only I saw a fairly large (approx. 30 ft long) black cigar shaped aircraft of some sorts. I have experience working around aircraft at night, and this was very different.  It had no sound (engine) after the initial noise. It flew from south to north just above a mature tree in our back yard. It dissappeared in an instant-making no noise at all. It was truely amazing. I wondered what I had just witnessed. Maybe some new Govt aircraft. I called EVV and talked to ATC. No reports of low flying aircraft. Our house lies under the approach pattern for aircraft from the south-however we are 6 miles south of the airport-much too far for an aircraft to be at an altitude of 40-60 feet. There are too many power lines for it too have been a hanged-glider, plus it was dark. That would have been suicide.;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
