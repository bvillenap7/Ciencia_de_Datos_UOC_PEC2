My first thought was a shooting star, but it was much larger. So large in fact, I waited for what I thought would be some type of impact or explosion. But there was none. The object fell from the sky at approximately a ninety degree angle. As the object raced toward the ground, I pointed it out to my passenger. When the event was over, I asked the person with me if they had seen what I had, just to make sure I had not seen a reflection or something similar. we both agreed it was something falling from the sky. The direction of travel was southwest to northeast. the night sky was very clear with stars;38.0423130279176;-87.5588391553313
