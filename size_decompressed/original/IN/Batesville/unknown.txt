Green explosion/flash lighting up the whole sky for an instant similar color to the Alaskian northern light green;2008-12-28 03:30:00;split second;Green explosion/flash lighting up the whole sky for an instant similar color to the Alaskian northern light green My girlfriend and I were in the hot tub between 3 and 4am on Sunday December 28, 2008 when the event took place.  It was very windy outside and I had just pointed out to my girlfriend to look at how hard the tops of the trees were swaying due to the wind and just as she looked up twards the top of the trees it there appeared to be an explosion/flash in the northeastern direction and was directly followed by the complete sky lighting up in a green flash.  I could not see an object before or after the event.  It did appear that the flash caused the green lighting of the sky.  Also it was the whole sky that lit up green not just a part of it or so it appeared that way.  The event was extremely quick, a second or two at most.  This was the first time I have ever seen anything like this.  I am very curious to find out if the account was witnessed by anyone else.;39.2947;-85.2292
