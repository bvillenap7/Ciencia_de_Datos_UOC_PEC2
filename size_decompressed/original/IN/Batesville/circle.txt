Just east of Batesville, Indiana we saw something in the sky. From a distance it looked like a blimp. When we got closer, we saw a round object rimmed in black. The center was transparent with lines running through it. It was hovering west of the interstate, made no sound, and was at a height of where you would see a helicopter in flight. It appeared to be about 200 yards in diameter. All traffic, including semis, were pulled off the interstate in both directions and people were out of their vehicles looking at the object. We did not stop and we did not have a camera available. Since it was still light outside, the object had no lights. We checked the newspapers and TV news the next week, but nothing was reported.;39.2947;-85.2292
