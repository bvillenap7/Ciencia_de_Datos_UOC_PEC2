Oval Shaped Object with orange lights hovering above neighbors field.;2012-12-02 02:15:00;1 minute;Oval Shaped Object with orange lights hovering above neighbors field. My daughter woke me up to her puppy whimpering and climbed in bed with me.  I was afraid that the puppy might go to the bathroom in the bed, so I decided to go ahead and take her outside to go use the bathroom.  We walked around the back of the house first and then to the front of the house.  I live in the country, so my neighbors arent close.  Across the street in my neighbors field.  I saw and oval shaped object with 6 orangey red lights around it.  Hovering about 100 ft off the ground.  There was no sound and it did not move.  Of course I was frightened so I grabbed the puppy and went into the house. I waited for my husband to come home from work.  I did not see the object leave.;39.2947;-85.2292
