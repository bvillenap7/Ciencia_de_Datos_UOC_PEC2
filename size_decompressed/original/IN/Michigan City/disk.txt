3 lighted circular air craft above Lake Michigan.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of twinkling star??  PD));2009-07-05 01:30:00;2 HRS;3 lighted circular air craft above Lake Michigan Early Sunday morning, July 5th, 2009, at approxiamtely 1:30am in Michigan City, Indiana, my friend and I were sitting on my parents deck 1 block off of Lake Michigan.   We are both in our 30's with children and have never experienced what we saw that night. In the Northern sky approximately 30 degrees toward the West, was a bright white light, with a flash of red and sometimes blue.  The sky was clear and there was a full moon.  Upon further study with binoculars, this was not a star, an airplane nor a blimp.  I've never believed in anything like this, and when I looked through the binoculars, I wanted to vomit.  We tried to think of what else it could be without stating the obvious.  Through the binoculars was an object with squared lights to the left/right, that towards the right side was bright white, and as you looked to the left the lights resemebled LED lights, flashing and moving.  This object sat above the water for approxiamtely 2 hours before it eventually turned and lowered.  The brightest white light was now on the left and it moved further north. ((NUFORC Note:  Given that the object was visible for two hours, we believe that it may have been a celestial body, perhaps a star, given that the object was flashing.
