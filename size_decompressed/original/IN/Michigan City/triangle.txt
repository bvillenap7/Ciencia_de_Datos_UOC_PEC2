Cluster of large triangle lights drops from the sky;2006-12-29 20:00:00;5 seconds;Cluster of large triange lights drops from the sky Returning from Chicago we were on the boarder of Indiana and Michigan. It was a rural area. It was a dark clear night with sveral stars. I was watching the stars when I saw an uncommonly bright cluster of lights in a triangle shape hover and dip quickly. At first I thought it might have been a falling star but they were in a formation and they dropped slower than a shooting star and it dropped straight down.  I waited to see if there was a crash on the ground but there was nothing;41.7010800000001;-86.87264
