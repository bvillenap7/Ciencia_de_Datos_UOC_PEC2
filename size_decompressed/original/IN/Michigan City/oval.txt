Bright orange light that appeared after the solar flare, disapeared within 5 or 6 minutes.;2003-10-30 16:45:00;5 Minutes;Bright orange light that appeared after the solar flare, disapeared within 5 or 6 minutes. My sister, neice, nephew and I were coming home from the Humane Society and talking about the solar flare that had just occured when my 11 year old neice said What's that orange thing? The other three of us looked straight ahead to the horizon (the object looked to be in the midst of some wispy clouds in a southwest direction.) I automatically said It's one of those planes that leave streaks in the sky until I realized it wasn't moving at all, it was just a bright orange oval shape hovering in the sky. We stopped the car to get a better look, but then continued down the road to the house. My neice and I grabbed the binoculars and hopped on our bikes, but once we got back down the road where there were no trees obstructing our view, the object was totally gone without a trace. The wispy clouds hadn't changed much, so we're not sure if it was a trick of the light or what.;41.7010800000001;-86.87264
