I'm 38 years old, white/blonde female, born and raised in Manhattan, college educated...recently bought a 14 acre farm in Michigan City, IN, next to a 300 acre, unusual soil and plant life nature preserve (Ambler Flatwoods).   My profession is a Author/Hypnotherapist.  The second witness is my cousin, white male/red hair, 37 years old, college educated.  He works for his father's metal recycling company.   May, 17, 2015, at approx. 2:40 pm, my cousin and I were sitting by a 1.3 acre pond on my farm property and looking up admiring a very tall tree near by.  I positioned my cell phone to take a picture of the tree - at that time, the sky was clear - no planes, sounds nor birds seen as we were looking up at the tree and surrounding sky.  I saw nothing except sky and the tree through my phone camera as I was trying to position the frame for the best angled shot.   As soon as I took the photo and checked it, and saw a rather dark and dense cigar/cyclical object with a slight bright aura around it very close to the tree's image in the photograph.  I quickly turned to my cousin and said, What is this??   Now, admittedly, I have been interested in ET's and alternative spirituality for quite some time.  Though I certainly would rather my photo be debunked than jump to wild conclusions.;41.7010800000001;-86.87264
