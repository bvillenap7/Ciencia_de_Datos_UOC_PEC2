I was turning into the rear area of my duty station, where I encountered a strange looking animal.;2015-12-16 05:35:00;3.5 minutes;With the aforementioned date and time.  I was turning into the rear area of my duty station, where I encountered a strange looking animal like that I perceived as possibly being either a reptile, raccoon possum or whatever.  What was so alarming to me was that it appeared to have some weird back legs and the face was at least eyes were flashing with a blinking motion.  I was stunned by its shape a looks.  I stopped my vehicle to investigate as to what I thought I saw. I pulled up against a grassy areas with the background of trees and beyond that apartment complexes.  I always arrive on or about that time and one day before this encounter I heard dogs cry with most unusual sounds, yet I thought nothing of it, until Wednesday, December 16, 2015.  As stated, I encountered this strange looking object that ran into the grass and while I was watching it, the object began to start a communication signal the eye socks were blinking like off and on...then it went diagonally with lights turning, from white, red, blue or greenish. I picked up my cell pointed in the direction of this light and captured the first .55 seconds, at which I was looking for my IPAD to capture more yet, I continued with the cell phone and captured 2.45minutes of the remaining observation of this unknown object.  I informed a co-worker arrived approximately 06:15 and asked him accompany me out that general once day light arrived.  We both gone out and seen nothing or no trace of what I was seeing. However, it was appromiately 15:00hrs, one hour before my departure from work that I showed the captured unknown object to my co-workers and it was then that I notice other unknown object, approximately 11 of them flying and around trees and a few were within the grass area.  Well, the recording will tell the story from there. I am not sure what it is or who but I do know it is not something I ever encounter before.;41.7010800000001;-86.87264
