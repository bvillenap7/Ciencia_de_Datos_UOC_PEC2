1 Lighted sphere in the sky transformed into 2 lighted sphere orbes.;2005-11-30 17:30:00;About 30 Seconds;1 Lighted sphere in the sky transformed into 2 lighted sphere orbes. For 20 years now I've been alive and in all my life I've never seen anything unusual in the sky.  Last night I was driving home from school and In the distant sky I caught a sight of a lighted sphere which slowly gained opacity and had an orange/yellowish glow. It was an orbe in the sky which had me thinking am I really seeing this, because I was driving I took one last look at the road then quickly looked back at this unusual object in the sky. It was dark in the sky so this object was clear as day 2 me. I watched as this one orbe stayed in its spot and trasformed into two orbs about 20 feet away from each other. It was like the 1 one duplicated itself into 2 orbs of light. After that the 2 orbs faded away in its darkness. This made me want to reverse my car and see if I could see the attraction again but nothing was there.... I don't know what I saw, I know human error is always a factor but this was seen right in front of my own eye's and I still can't believe it...
