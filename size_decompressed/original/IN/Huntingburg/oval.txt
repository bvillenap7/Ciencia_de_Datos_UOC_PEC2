Golden object during eclipse;2008-02-20 22:01:00;8 seconds;Golden object during eclipse I was out watching the lunar eclipse Wednesday 20th, 2008.  At 10:01 Eastern Time (as the eclipse was becoming total) an object came into view from overhead.  My attention had been on the Moon, so I didn't see it coming until it was noticeably passing just to the South of the Moon.  There had been no loud jet plane sound to signal it's appearance.  This was without a doubt the brightest object in the sky.  It was a brilliant golden color and had a flutter or wobble as it moved.  There were occasional flashes of red or white that I couldn't tell whether they were onboard lights or reflections because of the wobble.  Within a few seconds it had disappeared over the horizon.  It moved pretty well due East at a pretty good clip.  Within a minute, I could hear that a plane (jet?) was coming.  It followed the same basic path as the first object.  It's running lights were nowhere near as bright as the object before it.  It may have just been a coincidence, but it seemed that it was following the first object.;38.2954;-86.9470000000001
