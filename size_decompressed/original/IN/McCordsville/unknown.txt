Translucent or Cloaked UFO visible against night sky.;2020-03-05 21:14:00;4 seconds;Translucent or Cloaked UFO visible against night sky. Translucent against the night sky.  Best description is like the Predator movie creature ability to cloak.  About 1 mile altitude, moving NW to SE.  Had maybe 4 or 5 very dim lights within the ‘cloaked’ area.  Could not make out shape, only where it was based on how it distorted the sky behind it.  Silent, steady, even a smooth velocity.  Visible from once it was first seen until out of visual range at 4 to 5 seconds.;39.909;-85.9235
