My wife and I were sitting in our outdoor hot tub on the night of October 23, 2008. The sky was relatively clear.  A glowing circular shape drifted across the sky, leaving a light trail as it flew from the northeast to the southwest.  The next day we were talking to friends in Boulder, Colorado, who saw the same exact object at the same exact time as we did.;39.909;-85.9235
