A light that approximated a full moon in appearance above the tops of tress that are approximately 200-300 yards from observation point;2000-02-26 23:30:00;~10 Min;A light that approximated a full moon in appearance above the tops of tress that are approximately 200-300 yards from observation point.  Watched light for estimated 10 minutes when it got dimmer and faded away. As reported to me by my mother.  She looked out her back window (east) around 23:30 on 2-26-00, and saw a milky-white light low on the horizon that approximated a full moon.  It appeared to be just above the tops of trees that are about 200-300 yards from her observation point. Thinking that it was a reflection, she moved to another window for a different angle of sight, but found the light was still apparent from her new vantage point.  She continued to watch the light it gradually became dimmer and eventually completely faded away.  She approximates that the sighting lasted for 10 minutes.  She reported a haze around the light, and a milky-white color.;41.5977447368421;-85.8549565789474
Several sequencing lights appeared over a vast part of the southern sky from right outside the Goshen, Indiana area;2008-07-24 22:15:00;15 minutes;Several sequencing lights appeared over a vast part of the southern sky from right outside the Goshen, Indiana area Husband’s statement:  On the night of Wednesday, July 24, 2008, at 10:15 My wife and I witnessed a series of red-colored lights appear in the sky from our home, outside the Goshen, Indiana area. From our field of view, the lights first started to appear in the south-south-west area of the sky. I first witnessed two lights that where bigger then the stars around them. One of the lights were red, the second slightly above the first was white. They disappeared a few seconds after I saw them, then 5 degrees west, another red light appeared stationary like the first two and then faded out remaining in the same position. These first lights looked like they were several miles away and were fairly low in the southern horizon. I then told my wife, who was standing with me, that I thought there was something odd going on in the sky and motioned her to see. We then witnessed two more red lights appear, and then disappear, in a relative similar position to the first sighting . Less than a minute later ten red lights appeared in a sequence at an exact 45 degree angle.  Then two more lights appeared at a 45 degree angle away from the previous angle still in sequence with the other angle.  For 15 more minutes I had numerous red lights appear in the sky from south-south-west positions to south-west-west positions of the sky.  The lights appeared to be many miles away.  Wife’s statement:  We saw an amazing, unexplainable, display of lights.   Lights were appearing and disappearing all over the sky.  We even saw weird light patterns.  All this transpired about 15 minutes or so.;41.5977447368421;-85.8549565789474
Startling white light traveling with incredible speed;2011-06-17 14:30:00;1 second;Startling white light traveling with incredible speed The light looked 3 to 4 miles away from me as I was looking up into the grey, moonless night sky.   The light was very long, and it traveled very fast, approximately 2,000 mph.   The white light looked like it made a mile long trail as it descended from the sky, and that never touched the ground.;41.5977447368421;-85.8549565789474
2 people saw 12 orange objects in the sky over Goshen Indiana @10:15-11:30 on July 3rd moving N to S.;2014-07-03 22:15:00;75 minutes;2 people saw 12 orange objects in the sky over Goshen Indiana @10:15-11:30 on July 3rd moving north to south my dad and I saw 12 orange lights moving north to south over Goshen Indiana. It was approx. 10:15 pm-11:30pm on July 3rd.  They were not all at the same time although a few were fairly close together.  They would come from the north and go south and after a few minutes just disappear.  They were NOT airplanes nor fireworks, they moved in a horizontal motion only.  We could not tell what shape they were -it was too dark, but they were bright orange in color. No drugs or drinking was involved.   My 80 yr. old dad and I -I'm 52- both witnessed them.  It was the most interesting & bizarre thing I have ever seen.;41.5977447368421;-85.8549565789474
Multiple blue lights in the sky.;2014-07-04 22:00:00;45 minutes;Multiple blue lights in the sky While watching fireworks, my husband and I had seen what we thought was a satellite with a blue, unblinking light going from the south to the north.   We watched it for a moment, then continued to watch more fireworks.  Then there was another light, and another, and another, they just kept coming!!!!   Then about 30 minutes after the first light appeared, one had appeared going from the north to the south... The OPPOSITE direction of the others!!!!!  It got really bright for about 3 seconds, as if it entered the earth's atmosphere, then went back up and disappeared.  All of them were blue, and ALL of them moved very slowly...  Much slower than any airplane or satellite I have ever seen.;41.5977447368421;-85.8549565789474
Multiple large bright objects in western sky.;2015-09-16 20:00:00;10 minutes;Multiple large bright objects in western sky At first as we were driving home we noticed a triangular formation of bright orange lights. One was cigar shaped, the other two were circular.  One of the circular ones started to alternate between circular and cigar shaped.  It was almost like it was accelerating then decelerating, but it was very difficult to notice the transition as it was happening.  After a few more minutes several more lights appeared in the sky with the same orange-ish cast to them.  They seemed like really bright stars, but we've ever seen any stars that large before.  They must have been pretty far away, or very high up in the sky because as the earth rotated away from the sun we started to lose sight of the lights as they dipped lower and lower into the horizon.  The final lights we saw appear were very distinctly cigar shaped and almost seemed like comets.  Not sure if it was simply sunlight reflecting off some phenomena in the atmosphere or what.  Definitely a strange sight to behold.  It was hard to tell if they were moving because they were so far away they almost looked stationary. My fiancee took a photo but her camera was not able to distinguish the objects very clearly.;41.5977447368421;-85.8549565789474
