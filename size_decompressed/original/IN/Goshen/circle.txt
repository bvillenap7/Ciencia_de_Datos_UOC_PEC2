8 lights, performing differrent formations, then dissapearing;2011-07-29 22:00:00;15 minutes;8 lights, performing differrent formations, then dissapearing we had just got off work at 10pm, we left the parking lot and headed down pectora drive where we first saw 3 red bold lights in a triangle formation. as we turned onto Chelsie St. we then saw 2 more of the same lights apear out of the sky, then 3 more of the same lights followed, the first 3 lights hovered in one spot and waited for the other 5 lights to catch up, when all 8 lights were together they then formed a curved line. all the lights seemed to have a redish haze around them. we stop at the stop sign and put our heads out the window to listen for sounds. we heard nothing. as we turned right on Beck drive, the lights then formed 1 massive V formation, then split up into pairs after 3-4 minutes. as they split up into pairs , 2x2 they vanished into the night sky. what struck me the most was that there we plenty of planes around with blinking lighs but none of them could fit the description of the 8 lights;41.5977447368421;-85.8549565789474
