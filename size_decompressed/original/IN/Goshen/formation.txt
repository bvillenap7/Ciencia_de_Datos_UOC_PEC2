Five red/orange orbs fly in formation with no sound.;2013-08-25 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;Five red/orange orbs fly in formation with no sound At approximately 22:00 hours on 08/25/13, my mother and I saw a formation of five bright red/orange “orbs” fly across the sky.  There were four flying in what looked like a “V” or a concave polygon, with the fifth one flying behind the formation.   They moved at a steady pace and seemed to be flying low, but there was no sound.  The light on the crafts was large and steady it did not blink.   We watched until trees obstructed our view.;41.5977447368421;-85.8549565789474
