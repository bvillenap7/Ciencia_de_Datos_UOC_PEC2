It was Sunday. Later that night, a fireworks show was presented. About a minute after the finale we saw a couple of fireballs. We thought they were part of the fireworks, but they lasted for about four minutes. Other witnesses jokingly exclaimed that they were UFO's, but no one really cared. I only noticed one but three more appeared, one after another. They were orange colored and it seemed to twinkle as well. Their shapes were simple ovals. They seemed to move slowly towards us, but they didn't get any bigger. Near the fourth minute, they turned to the left (west) until they faded. I only noticed 4 of the ovals, but there could have been more due to trees in the way. My guess on their location when they first appeared would be about five miles east from dunlap and disappeared in the Dunlap area.;41.5977447368421;-85.8549565789474
