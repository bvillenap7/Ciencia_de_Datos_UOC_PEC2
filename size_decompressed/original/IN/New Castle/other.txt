flying banana shaped object caught on film;2002-08-20 13:00:00;10 seconds;flying banana shaped object caught on film we were walking through a cornfield and heard a pulsating low tone up in the air.  we looked up and saw a banana-shaped that at first appeared dark green then faded to a lighter green.  It appeared to shoot out of the clouds towards earth vertically, then abruptly stopped, and went from a vertical position to horizontal.  Then it spun around like a propeller, stopped in mid air, then turned vertical and shot straight up into the clouds.  We were able to snap a few pictures with a digital camera we had with us.;39.9192;-85.3676
