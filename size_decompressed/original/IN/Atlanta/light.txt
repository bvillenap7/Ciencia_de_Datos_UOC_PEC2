Lights in a straight line that go out from left to right in the night sky;2007-05-17 22:30:00;5 seconds;Lights in a straight line that go out from left to right in the night sky I don’t necessarily believe in flying saucers, but I do think that there are unidentified flying objects.  I would just like to know if anyone else saw what I saw.  I would also like to see if there is a logical explanation.  On May 17, at approximately 10:30 p.m. Out of the corner of my eye I saw 2 or 3 red/orange colored lights in a row, horizontally in the sky.  When I actually looked directly at the lights I saw two.  They appeared to be slightly larger than Venus.  The approximate distance between them would be about an inch if you measured at an arms length.  The one on the left faded out(it looked like it just slowly went out), then the one on the right.  They were in the western sky approximately to the 5 o’clock of Venus(I'm guessing it was Venus), about halfway between the horizon and Venus.  The entire “sighting” took approximately 5 seconds.  I didn’t hear anything out of the ordinary at the time.  I continued to watch the same area of the sky for a few minutes but didn’t see anything else.  There are no towers in that direction that I could have mistaken for the lights.  I was located approximately 1 mile east of Atlanta, Indiana.  Weather  according to weather.com: 	Clear 	48 deg.

Seems to float almost as high as a small plane would fly.  Try to watch it as long as we can before we go back to sleep.  We have seen the light outside of our bedroom window, facing south.;40.2072;-86.0176
