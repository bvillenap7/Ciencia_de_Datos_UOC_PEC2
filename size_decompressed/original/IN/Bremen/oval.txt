Lights seen in the Northwestern sky over Bremen, IN.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD));2012-04-26 22:00:00;1 hour;Lights seen in the Northwestern sky over Bremen, IN. Seen in the Northwestern sky.  It seemed to big to be a star or planet.  It stayed still for about an hour.  I went out an hour later and I didn't see it anymore.  It had bright white lights and small blue lights on each end.I did not see any blinking lights on it.  There was one other star above it that would have been the next brightest object near it.  With-in an hour time span, does the night sky change position that fast where I would not see the object after an hour?
