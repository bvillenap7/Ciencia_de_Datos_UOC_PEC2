Solid star appearing red light, very fast, no flashing or trail was left;2003-06-05 22:30:00;3-5min;Solid star appearing red light, very fast, no flashing or trail was left Witnessed a small light in the sky, elevation unknnown but it appeared to be quite high.  The small object was moving to the southeast at a very high rate of speed,  I have witnessed this type of obetect in the area on a number of occasions, most being witnessed during the summer.  Also, witnessed on a different occasion, a friend of mine and I seen a number of similar objects in one night.  One of the objects also split into two different pieces instantly and continued thier paths in a seperate direction.  Myself and the witness have a small amount of skywatching experiance, but we knew enough to know that it wasn't a meteor, or an airplane( I used to be in the Air Force).  The object looks like a star, no flashing lights, and a constant reddish color.;41.4477;-85.2609000000001
Even more lights in the sky, Reddish orange in color, very high, very fast, some movements.;2003-06-19 22:18:00;23:30;Even more lights in the sky, Reddish orange in color, very high, very fast, some movements. Yet again, my best friend, along with my girlfriend, witnessed several lights in the sky.  This is abnormal, the most I have ever seen at a time is two, and in just over one-hour we witnessed SIX of these lights.  The last one that we seen was traveling in a south easterly direction, it was also due to intersect a large aircraft, perhaps a passenger jet.  However, it turned to the north quite rapidly to avoid the cross over.  I live in the country so I have a pretty good view of the sky and there was no moon last night.  But on almost any given night I can go outside and see at least one of these things.  Also we seen three meteors, one of which was guite a show!;41.4477;-85.2609000000001
craft moving about in the morning sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible planet??  PD));2007-09-28 02:27:00;ongoing;craft moving about in the morning sky I stepped outside to get some air and I tooked into the night sky and saw an object in the Northeastern sky that wasn't supposed to be there. The light it gave off was kind of yellowish orange. Although it was still dark out, I did compare this light against some stationary objects and notice it was moving. I watched it for awhile and it moved around. Abrupt turns to the left, then the right, then it moved quickly only to bunny hop so to speak. I attempted to video the object, but my cell phone was unable to find it in the sky. At this point, it is still darting about ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
