Eight or so bright orange-red lights proceeding east to west, almost directly toward our position at the edge of a golf course.   Estimated altitude less than 5000 ft.  Craft shape is uncertain.  These lighted objects were in nearly a single file line, possibly a mile or more apart.  At an estimted distance of three miles, each object made what seemed to be a 90 degree course change, and fly northward toward Michigan.  The turn was fairly quick, as though a helicopters rather than a fixed wing prop plane.  Speed was steady for all, and though altitude is really uncertain, they seemed to be subsonic, moving no faster than a small airplane.  Curiously, upon turning, the front light seemed to disappear, but there was no taillight that could be seen on the side, if there was a side.  It was almost totally dark, so absent the light, the craft disappeared almost immediately.  Each one advanced in line, turned, then disappeared, over a total of 3 minutes.  We heard ! no sound of engines of any kind.;41.4477;-85.2609000000001
