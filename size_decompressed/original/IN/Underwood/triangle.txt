On several occasions now I have observed multiple objects with three bright white lights in a triangular pattern.  They are always in or around the same area of night sky which isn't to far away from where a major airports air trafic circles when waiting to land.  I first thought it was possibly a helicopter because it seemed to hover in the same place briefly before moving on again as if on a Sunday drive. There's no audible sound which I can hear nor can I see any kind of chemtrail.  All I know is that I've lived in this area all of my life and never have I or anyone else for that matter seen anything like it up until a few years ago??;38.6033;-85.7794
