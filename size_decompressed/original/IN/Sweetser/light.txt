Red light sighted over Sweetser Indiana.;2013-09-13 02:18:00;5 minutes;Red light sighted over Sweetser Indiana. On the morning of Sept.13,2013 approximately 2:18 a.m., I sighted a pulsating,dull pinpoint of light in the sky bearing 170 degrees, azimuth 75 degrees.  This light pulsated at around two Hz from a dull red to almost dark.  Altitude was impossible to determine, although it looked about right for airliner cruising altitude. Its heading was 080 degrees. Its apparent speed was again similar to that of an airliner.  The object appeared to maintain heading and speed for a duration of around 3 minutes.  After this period, I took my dogs back into the garage and immediately returned outside and looked to where I had last seen the object. Could not reacquire.  Throughout sighting, the atmospheric conditions were clear with no moon nor clouds.  Temp was around 60 degrees as of two hours previous, per my pickup truck thermometer. I apologize for the prosaic nature of this sighting.  What struck me as odd about it was the fact that I saw no other aircraft lighting associated with this object, such as the green starboard wing tip light.  It is possible that due to the apparent angle of my position to this object in relation to its travel path, such a starboard light may have been obscured by the body of this object.  Neither did I see a white strobe tail light or steady white landing gear light.;40.5599;-85.7657
