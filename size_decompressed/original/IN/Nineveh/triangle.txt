Triangle unidentified aircraft with 3 lights along the back instead of the usual triangle pattern, light in middle was brighter.;2014-02-11 23:15:00;30 seconds;Triangle unidentified aircraft with 3 lights along the back instead of the usual triangle pattern, light in middle was brighter. I live in Sweetwater lakes are of Nineveh, Indiana, (just to be more specific on exact place) and I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette.  Looking West, I saw what looked like a helicopter with a search light coming towards me heading East.   As it got closer, I saw that it wasn't a helicopter but a triangle (as far as my eyes could make out) aircraft moving at a relatively slow speed.  The truly odd thing about it was that it had 3 lights along the end of it.  Two on the back points of the triangle and one in the middle of the back that was noticeably brighter than the other two.  It flew over head, slowly, heading East. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.3665;-86.0939
