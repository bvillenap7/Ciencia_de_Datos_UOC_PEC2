Pinkish-orange small lights (8-9 of them) in odd formation over Mooresville, Indiana;2012-04-07 21:00:00;2 minutes;Pinkish-orange small lights (8-9 of them) in odd formation over Mooresville, Indiana This event was already going on as we walked into the back yard (driveway area). I looked up and saw about 8 or 9 lights that were pinkish/orange in a formation just above the lowest clouds. They were high enough that I thought they might be airplanes, but airplanes would never fly that close together. There were about 4 or 5 on the left in a a long formation then on the right about 3 together and two more a lottle lower down. I listened to try ande hear engine noises but there were none.  I tried to get my camera out but seeing this disturbed me and I was kind of frozen and scared at the same time. They began moving as a group and went benind the low clouds and could not be see anymore. Mooresville is near the Indpls airport and I have seen and heard planes for many many years and this was not anything I've ever seen.  In thinking about this, the lights could not have come from the ground up, because lights from the ground would not be able to disappear behin! d clouds from above like they did.  The lights were not large they were like pinpoints.;39.5906;-86.3667999999999

We are in the flight path for Indianapolis International.   These objects would have been in the airspace of the airport, and possibly in the flight path depending on the active runways.   They were about 2000ft agl, estimate speed at 100-120 kts, steady, and made no sound what so ever.;39.5906;-86.3667999999999
A fast round bright light.;2014-10-31 20:00:00;3 seconds;A fast round bright light I observed with a family member a bright object in the sky. We were sitting by our front living room window waiting for trick or treaters when we both saw a bright light fly by. It was in the form of a sparkling round light with the color of orange and white.  It was considerably low in the sky just above the tree line, much lower than any commercial airline. It also moved considerably fast, too fast for any airplane.  It flew by in a matter of 3 seconds or less.  No sound was made nor were there any vibrations to our home. We have seen several falling stars before but this was so low in altitude during a cloudy/snowy night we determined it had to be something else. It did not seem to burn out but continue on its path, making a small change in direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
