Squared flying object in western sky of New Palestine Indiana April 26 2012;2012-04-26 01:30:00;4 seconds;squared flying object in western sky of New Palestine Indiana April 26 2012 In early morning hours of April 26 2012, in the western sky, I briefly observed a flying black object of square to diamond shape pass laterally between darknesses of two storm clouds. Our sky was illuminated enough as backdrop to make the object's appearance unmistakeable.  The size was much larger than airplanes appear so it was either very close or very large.  I mentioned it to my spouse after seeing it and told him I either saw a UFO or a flying witch.  I had been taking the dog out for his potty time when this siting occurred.;39.7211;-85.8986
