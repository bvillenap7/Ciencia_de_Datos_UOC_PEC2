2 lights moving in a circular pattern;2008-07-13 00:00:00;One hour plus;In the lower South Eastern sky we observed 2 lights moving in a circular pattern. They seemed to be chasing each other and at times criss crossed and a few times would back up. They could only be observed when there was a cloud in front of them. After the cloud passed, we would see nothing, but when one moved into the area, the lights would appear. They were circular in size and about the size of a full moon. We watched this for about 2 hours.;39.7211;-85.8986
