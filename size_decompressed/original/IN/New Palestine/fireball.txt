A dozen fireballs seen in sky near New Palestine, IN;2013-09-28 20:15:00;15 min.;A dozen fireballs seen in sky near New Palestine, IN I went outside to lock my chicken house shortly after 8 p.m.  Walking back to the house I noticed a very bright fireball in the SSW moving silently to NNE.  Then two more followed.  I thought that was all but then another came moving in the same direction and two of the former ones seemed to stop and come back toward the last one.  I called my husband to come out and we saw about seven more.  There could have been more before I saw the first one.  I took a photo with my phone and my husband tried to see it with binoculars but he was unable to identify anything.  They looked like fire and were not nearly as high as the planes that were going over, and it totally silent.;39.7211;-85.8986
