Erratic moving red lights rising in the sky, followed by an unusual number of aircraft in the sky.;2012-03-18 21:00:00;roughly 30 minutes.;Erratic moving red lights rising in the sky, followed by an unusual number of aircraft in the sky. I was outside on the phone with a friend of mine. I looked across the street and noticed a bright, almost fiery looking red light slowly rising into the sky. I couldn't figure out what it was, so I ran inside to bring my sister outside to see if she could see it and/or knew what it was.  When we got back outside, it was gone.  As we searched for it, we noticed the sky was unusually clear for our area, and the stars were unusually bright. When we faced the opposite direction, we saw the light again above our neighbors house, moving in an erratic manner and darting all over.  Then, it was gone. We then noticed another, in a different part of the sky, which my sister recorded on her phone. It was moving similarly.  We then began to notice a number of airplanes in the sky, all about the same distance away from us, all in different parts of the sky.  All flying as if they were flying the perimeter of the earth that's the best way to describe it. We counted 9 airplane! s.  That amount of airplanes, all at once, is EXTREMELY unusual in our area particularly.  We also looked up to see a very, very large plane fly overhead that was so large and so close, the shape could be made out perfectly.  It was loud and had bright circular lights lining the bottom of it in a V-formation something I've never seen on an airplane before.
