At first we thought we were being attacked by teenagers running towards us with lit cigarettes (or lighting bugs coming through the woods and grass) until more and more of these lights appeared (over thirty moving were now all over the place) and were now moving in a floating manner right torwards us (forty feet away).   This was not human, this what we seen, is humanly unabe to really describe. These lit probes moved together yet each constant lit tiny light moved as if separate, and knowing we were there, it was coming after us because we were there.  We hardly ever talk about it, except now that we are older, I have begun to wonder more strongly what encountered us, we tried to rule out anything alien, because I do not believe life exist in space. Maybe something scientific and unexplainabe is taking place. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD));41.5334;-87.4219
