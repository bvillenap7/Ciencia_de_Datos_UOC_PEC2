dark grey unlit triangular craft hovering silently;2003-08-19 03:30:00;5 minutes;dark grey unlit triangular craft hovering silently On or about 8-19-03 at 03:30, (I have trouble sleeping at times), I was on my way to a local 24 hour gas station to gas up the car for the next day's errands.  I drove to the end of my street and stopped at the stop sign and was getting ready to turn right.  I checked the traffic to my left, and of course on a week day there wasn't a car in sight.  For some reason, I happened to look up slightly when I looked left and saw a triangular shape in the sky slightly above the tree top and maybe a one block distance from where I was.  The object was dark grey in color, no lights at all and was hovering motionless in the sky tilted slightly so that one point was lower than the other two, as if it were looking at something on the ground. It was the size of a private plane if the plane was in the same spot. I was sitting in my car so I rolled down the drivers side window because I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  The object never moved or made a sound the 5 plus minutes I sat there looking at it.  It's like my eyes were seeing this object but my brain wasn't registering what I was seeing.  I went down to gas up the car and on my way back I was searching the same part of the sky that I had seen the object.  I was only gone for 5 or 6 minutes but the thing was gone.  I sat in my car at the end of my street searching the sky in that area and did not see it anymore.  I drove down my street, parked the car and stood out in front of my house and didn't see anything else.  I was terrified because I usually go out in the very early morning hours and if I didn't look in that particular part of the sky that early morning I would not have seen it.  The color difference between the night sky and the craft was slight, and you would have had to look directly at it to see it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.5334;-87.4219
