Minutes later what apeard to be a shooting star trailed the western sky or ten seconds maybe, then another, they both dissapeared, then reappeared together parallel to eachother and vanished again seconds later,my phone was charging in the house and that was my only source of photo recording device. I got the phone back, tho its prepaid, i have three short videos and one picture. lo quality but you can definetly see it, as i was video recording it, something passed by with a similar shape of the tsr 71 black bird, or a stealth bomber. What seemed to be a spot light came on and off, it flew low maybe 1000 feet then vanished.blinking starts seemed to appear in a triangular patter, then everything dissapeared.
