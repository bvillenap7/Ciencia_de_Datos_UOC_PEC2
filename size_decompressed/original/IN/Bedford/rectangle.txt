Craft searching a field;2001-10-18 22:30:00;15 minutes;Craft searching a field I was out in the county, going to a spot my friends and I liked to part at.  I was driving around the corner before Devil's Backbone, when I saw it.  At first I thought it was an airplane, the airports only a few miles away, but something about it wasn't quite right.  I pulled off of the road at an observation spot for the backbone, which looks out over a valley.  I could see the craft hovering down there, then it would fly up higher.  I would estimate that it never got higher than a few thousand feet, as I could still make out individual lights.  It almost seemed to be flying a search pattern, it just went back and forth, high and then low.  It seemed to be moving slowly, ground speed wise.  I am pretty familiar with the area where it was, and I know about how much ground it covered.  It took about two minutes to make one pass over the valley, which is only about half a mile across or so.  It flew by seven or eight times, then just took off like a rocket!  It disappeared from my sight in about ten seconds, but there wasn't much noise, I don't know if what I heard was the wind or the craft.  I do know that right before it left, I heard a train approaching the Tunnelton Tunnel, which is very near by.  I could hear the whistle, probably a mile or two from me.;38.8729;-86.486
