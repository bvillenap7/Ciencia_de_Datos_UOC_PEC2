Was sitting on porch and saw a black floating sphere floating over some trees in distance. It then had a teal blue light flash and started lowering into trees while flashing.  The closest thing it resembled was a beach ball and the lights were where the white part of ball would be in two sections and the rest was black.  I saw it flash one last time through some trees and birds started flying away and it disappeared.;38.8729;-86.486

They were not moving a lot, and during that time, 4 of them faded from view, or may have been obscured by clouds.;38.8729;-86.486
