Interesting moon view with telescope, unknown objects.;2004-10-25 21:00:00;2 consecutive nights;Interesting moon view with telescope, unknown objects. On Oct 23rd, 2004 I purchased a telescope from Wal Mart a 5 inch Meade with a lot of buttons on it. I spent a couple of days trying to learn to use it and took it out the following night. I didn't really know where to start or what to look at so I just decided to check out the surface of the moon. It was really amazing to see all the surface features, craters etc.  About an hour had went by of gazing and trying the different powered lenses. I zoomed in on the moon using 25mm eyepiece which will focus on a 3-400 sq. mile area of the moon. I started noticing that about every minute and a half or so, sometimes one but mostly in pairs little black dots would go by as if it were some type of plane orbiting the moon (the moon was full). At first I thought that it was satellites that circle the earth passing in front of the moon, but then I realized that this would have to be something orbiting the moon itself due to the multiple times that these objects traveled the exact same path. The next night I decided to look at the moon again oddly enough I saw the same black dots mostly in pairs and slightly staggered but sometimes only one. I watched this for about 30 minutes, probably 12-13 times. These were very clear black dots and any satellite between here and the moon would not be this clear and so small. So I wrote some emails to astronomers and asked, thinking it would be something easily explainable. The response I got back stated that anything orbiting the moon would be too small to be seen in a telescope and also they knew of nothing currently orbiting the moon. I've looked at the moon a dozen or so times since and have not seen anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));38.8729;-86.486
