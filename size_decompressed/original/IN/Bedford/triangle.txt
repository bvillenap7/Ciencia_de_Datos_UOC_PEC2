Couple miles from the nearest town.All of a sudden what i belive to be identified as an black triangle(ufo) was sitting about 50 feet above the tree line. It was triangle in shape,with three red rings glowing red on the bottom of the corners. There was no sound at all..what felt like forever,however it shot off to the south east in seconds. To this day i dont know what it was but always keep an eye in the sky.;38.8729;-86.486
