I was driving westbound on Mishawaka Ave, crossing the St. Joseph River.  To my north, I noticed a craft, flying low, traveling to the northwest.  I turned my car north onto the first road west of the bridge, turned off the car, and rolled down the windows...I wathched this circular craft drift over the river, just above the trees.  It had yellow and white lights blinking around the outer circumference, there were NO sounds from the craft.  I watched it until it went out of sight.  When I completed my delivery, I went back to the shop and told everyone!!  They wanted to know if I saw any Purple People!!  Today, I live in Miami, Florida.  I am the Natural Areas Manager for the county and have a BS degree in Biology.  I'm not a kook, this really happened.  My family knows, I just thought it should be recorded by you guys for posterity.  Truely, ((name and address deleted));41.6669617021277;-86.1662627659574
two craft cicled one another for a short while, then stopped, and rapidly ascended upward out of view.;1993-07-12 22:00:00;5 minutes;two craft cicled one another for a short while, then stopped, and rapidly ascended upward out of view. Myself and three friends were outside playing basketball late one night.  I stopped playing for a while and rested on the lawn.  As I was laying on my back, I noticed a bright circular/oval shape hovering back and forth over the area.  It was about the size of a nickle hald at arms length about as high as a helicopter might fly.  As I called my friends over to watch, another craft appeared.  They (the craft) flew overhead and circled one another for about two or three minutes, then stopped momentarily, and shot skyward at a very high speed.  The objects were, as I said, circular and had a bright, but not illuminating, light cast from them.They did not move too quickly before dissapearing. Maybe at a rate of 40 to 45 mph (est.).;41.6669617021277;-86.1662627659574
a round object, with a loud noise and two green lights on the top, spinning, It was there and just like that it was gone;2008-09-18 06:30:00;45sec;a round object, with a loud noise and two green lights on the top, spinning, It was there and just like that it was gone My 14 yr old daughter was getting up for school and heard a loud noise outside.  She looked out her window and there was a round object with two green lights out of the top of it and they, the lights were rotating.  On her way to school a girl on the bus said she had seen something this morning and my daugher waited until she described it.  It was the exact same thing she had seen.  I don't know how to explain any of this too her.  She is a bit frightened.  Do we call the news or not?;41.6669617021277;-86.1662627659574
There were 3 lights dancing around each other as if they were playing.  ((anonymous report));2016-05-23 23:00:00;15 seconds;While stepping outside before night's end, I always look to the stars.  There were 3 lights dancing around each other as if they were playing in the night sky.   I have seen UFO's before and told my girlfriend.  You can imagine the looks she gives me.  But last night (5-23-16) she saw first-hand, and is still in aweâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
