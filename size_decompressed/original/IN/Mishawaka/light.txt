UFO crosses sky in the dead of night.;2005-06-06 02:00:00;5-6 seconds;UFO crosses sky in the dead of night. While lying on my trampoline looking at the stars I saw what appeared to be 3 bright venus's stuck together, flying from SW to NE at maybe 5,000 feet. No trail like a shooting star. Crossed entire sky in just a few seconds. Very smooth and quiet. Never saw anything like it before. No way an airplane, a completely different level of speed. Flew in a straight line.;41.6669617021277;-86.1662627659574
2/4 orange Circle's of light over Mishawaka ,Indiana;2011-07-05 00:30:00;90 seconds;2/4 orange Circle's of light over Mishawaka,Indiana My Mother and I pulled in the driveway got out of car.  I got some things from the back seat and as I turned I saw 2 orange circles of light flashing in the south eastern sky.   They seemed like they were about a 1/2 mile away when we first spotted them, and maybe they were the size of a small helicopter.   I had just came back from watching fireworks and had my camera in my front pocket.  I grabbed it and started filming it they came forward side by side very slowly.  Since I was using a digital camera I only taped it for 32seconds and than shut the camera off and tried to take a picture of it but didn't get anything.   They were getting closer and I for got to turn the camera back on because I couldn't believe what I was seeing.   They eventually turned to the right and seemed to be on top of each other and then they flew all most out of sight.   We came inside and I called the police and reported it and asked if anyone else had seen it and they said they hadn't reciev! ed any calls as of yet.  I than powered up my pc to get the UFO Hotline and called them and reported it.   After I spoke to him, I checked my camera and we only saw 2 orange lights but the camera picked up 4 blinking orange and blue lights.   I than went back outside and there was set's of 2 lights in the sky everywhere it seemed like hundreds of them, I ran back to the phone to call the hotline back to report them.  They are still out there at 1:39 am, they look like stars but if anyone look's close every light has a second light the same distance from it  and there are groups of 2 lights all over the sky.   There are so many here I can't find the big dipper.  I called a friend of mine in Elkhart Indiana to tell him what I saw and after I told him he said he was driving back from Chicago, IL, and saw some strange light's in the sky as well and when I told him about the light's that I am still seeing he described the same thing to me.
