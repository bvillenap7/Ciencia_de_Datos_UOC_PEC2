My husband was reclined down looking out the sun roof.  He jumps and says what was that? I did not see it yet.  My husband discribed it as a gray, huge watermellon shaped object.  We were getting off the by-pass and I was looking for a place to park to look.  A few minutes later, I parked in the Meijers Parking lot.  By this time it was a mile away.  Large like the size of the Sun at sunset.  My husband said it looked like a triangle from off in the distance.  It did not move like a plane.  Back and force like a sea-saw.   It went in and out of the clouds a few time, then disappeared.  To me it looked totally round, like a dark circle, balloon, without a basket.  We are 49 years old.  Of course when we share this with family, they just smile and listen.  End of story  My son had a UFO experience too about seven years back.  He was in his car with cousin, maybe a friend too, and something small like his car, came real close to them and took off super fast.  It tagged along with them at the night time and zoomed with percular patterns, unlike airplanes.  My son is now a pilot.  He was only 18 or so back at the time this happen, late in the evening with his cousin, who also saw the unknown aircraft around Warsaw, IN.  My sister claims about 30 years ago, she and her friend was chased by one,  My mom thought she was drunk.  The teenage girls ran into the house and hid, peaking out the windows to see if it had left yet.  Also I had an older friend who said they like to go out at Heaton Lake in Indiana a watch for UFO's - this too has been long ago.  Maybe 29 year s ago.    Had you ever heard about that??;41.6669617021277;-86.1662627659574
