Not like a airplane. More like an astroid. I thought I was watching a falling star. Then it stopped falling and just sat there as a fire ball. I watched it untill I needed to go into the store. When I came out it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));41.6669617021277;-86.1662627659574
