My wife and I were on our way home at a little after 9pm. I was in the passenger seat and was looking toward the houses outside my window. I saw six bright lights in the sky through the trees. They were spread out too far apart to be one craft.   I told my wife to pull over and she asked where and kept driving.  After about ten seconds there was a parking lot so she pulled over.  As we were watching another car pulled in with a young girl, she parked and watched. I tried to get a video on my phone but it didn't stay on my phone.  My wife noticed an airplane flying near the group and said those aren't planes.  The unidentified craft started disappearing first 2 then one-by-one.  When that happened the girl drove away while talking on her phone.  After the last light disappeared we left and while driving home we both agreed whatever the lights were was unidentified.
