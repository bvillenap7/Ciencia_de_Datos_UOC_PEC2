I then walked over and peered out the window and at a very low altitude (too low for an airplane) I saw a large triangle shaped craft with large red lights on bottom.  I then moved to the back of the house and looked out the windows from my porch, the craft was still moving very slowly.  I opened the sliding window and observed no sound.  The craft continued over and past the tree line in a northwest direction.  I live approximately 10 miles from an airport but have never observed anything that resembles this before.;41.6669617021277;-86.1662627659574
Three lights flying over us.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2009-03-19 23:00:00;1 min;Three lights flying over us. My two friends and me where walking over the train tracks at about 10:40 or so heading back from a friends house.  My friend was counting the stars and I said to him that I never count the stars.  Then my other friend said, “What is that.”  I looked up and saw three dim lights almost transparent they were yellowish orange almost street light color lights in a triangle form flying across the sky.  It made no sound.  It looked like spotlights but it kept going off in the distance.  We stood there in shock.  We waited to see if we could see it again and if it was really, spotlights after all but we did not see it again.  We took off running back to my house and told every body there.  I do not think anybody believed us.  It blew my mind.  Today I looked up pictures of stealth bombers during the nighttime to see any similarities.  It looked very different from what we seen.  Therefore, I found this web sight and had to tell our story.   IT WAS UNBELIVABLE .Me and my friends used to talk about UFO's, and aliens all the time but I never thought I would have the opportunity to see one.  It gives me the chills just thinking about it.

Red light triangle over Indiana;2013-05-09 02:32:00;4-5 seconds;Red light triangle over Indiana My son & I were out enjoying a cigar, watching the perfectly clear night sky.  I just happen to look straight up at my 12 o'clock position and caught a triangle going in a slight north northeast position, coming from slight south southwest.  Totally silent, hard to say what altitude was at least 30,000 feet had to be larger than passenger plane. Had red lights on all 3 corners, running at a level flight.  My son caught the tail-end of the sighting after I pointed out to him, seeing the rear 2 red lights.  I found this website to see if there was any other reports in my area.  Saw the report on 4/01/13 in Brookston,IN.  Identical description and direction...went onto MapQuest you could draw a straight line in slight north northeast direction to Mishawaka IN. approx. 100 miles.  Went to internet to calculate air speed of triangle... using 30,000 ft. time covering horizon in 5 seconds at least 900 mph.;41.6669617021277;-86.1662627659574
