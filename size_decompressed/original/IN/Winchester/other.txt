Orange-red star-like light moving at high rate of speed observed in East-Central Indiana, USA on 6/16/11;2011-06-16 23:20:00;20-30 seconds;Orange-red star-like light moving at high rate of speed observed in East-Central Indiana, USA on 6/16/11 I was star-gazing in the vicinity of the Big Dipper (north/north-west sky).  I saw what at first appeared to be just another star in the night sky.  Then it started moving at a fairly good speed.  It was orange-red in color----looked just like a star, about 2.5-3.0 level magnitude of brightness.  It was not a meteor----too slow for that.  It was not a jet or any other conventional aircraft.  Too fast for that.  It was not an orbital satellite---too fast.   From my vantage-point in East-Central Indiana, I first observed it outside of the area of the dipper part of the Big Dipper.  It moved through the Dipper & out of it---then it vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.1634;-85.0127
