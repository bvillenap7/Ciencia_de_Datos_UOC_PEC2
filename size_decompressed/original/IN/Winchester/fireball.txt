ORB, small craft  3 or 4 of us seen this.;1975-06-08 21:00:00;3 hours;ORB, small craft  3 or 4 of us seen this. Back in the middle 1970s I was about 16 years old. I was on my way home on a bike I lived in a trailer court across the street was a lamb farm.  Home was only two trailers left of the farm when I made my left turn as soon as I made the left turn!  There was an ORB about the size of a muskmelon it was an orngesh red.  It went by to my right about four feet off the ground and if knew it was beside me I could have touched it but it flew by or did it come from me?  It flew out to the field at an angle.  I toke my bike to the house and walked back to the inter section where I seen the orb but I did not see any thing out there it was getting dark. Later, I told my sister it was almost 10 pm her and friend and son and myself went out were I seen the orb they thought I was crazy but we looked out in the field that I last seen it.  A and there was something out in the field only to see a faint light but there was something going in and out of what ever this was we seen?  It was only about 3 football fields away we all seen it could not realy tell what shape it was but it WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A small BUS WITH A DOOR IN THE middle. We did not say much to each other and we standing there till 12,  maybe 1, am.  We went back home and never talked about it again to each other for a few years and we all still say there was something out in that field that they keep lambs at. And I know some thing happened out there.  I never seen that ORB come up be hind me but was so close to me and when I that second I turned my bike I began to wonder if it came from me?

Red and Orange Sparkling Orb Defies Aviation Principles;2010-07-04 22:30:00;2 minutes;Red and Orange Sparkling Orb Defies Aviation Principles On the evening of the 4th of July 2010 my son and I were walking my dog.  We spotted a red and orange sparkling ball traveling directly at us.  My son said “what is that”?  I told him I didn’t know but stated it was coming right at us.   The object was traveling horizontally and then shot vertically.  I can only describe the speed as a reverse falling star. This object disappeared into the heavens in a couple of seconds.  I have been a practicing engineer for an auto company for 25 years.   This object was not constructed by humans of this planet.;40.1634;-85.0127
