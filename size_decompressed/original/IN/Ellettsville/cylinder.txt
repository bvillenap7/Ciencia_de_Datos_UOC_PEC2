Was driving to work and saw a shiny silver object in the sky, just above the trees in Ellettsville.  Watched the object for about 5 minutes from one stop light to the next and the cylinder shaped object didn't move.  I thought it was a plane or maybe a hovercraft, but it stayed perfectly still.   I pulled into the parking lot of a local company to take a picture,  but then it was just gone.  I saw something like it when I was about 15 and my mom and I watched the object,  thinking it was a street light because of the shape and brightness, but it was way to high in the sky.  When we got to a stopping point over a field, we got out of your vehicle and watched it.  My mom told me to get the camera and when I turned around with it,  the object changed shape,  yup almost a football, changed colors,  and shot off in a southern direction so fast it wad gone in a half second.;39.2535;-86.6259
