I noticed a helicopter flying semi-low and thought that was odd for that area but ignored the oddness. I then looked to the right side of the sky and saw the large sphere/ball in the sky. It wasn't moving, just holding it's position in the sky. I noticed that helicopter I saw was flying AWAY from this craft. It was a large silver/chrome ball and I only saw it because the sun was reflecting off of it like crazy! I tried to grab my phone and it totally vanished.  Cloaking or some kind of invisibility as it didn't move at all.  Once I got pulled over,  I noticed other planes in an odd area (not a normal fly zone, never see planes around here, no hospitals or helicopter pads, no airport, etc.) and it was so high up I could barely see the dark  colored plane. Didn't see the silver sphere after that.;39.2535;-86.6259
