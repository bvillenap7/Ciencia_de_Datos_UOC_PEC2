During Sept 11ths No Fly order, red ball is chased down by possible military aircraft & both vanish.;2001-09-13 23:00:00;2 minutes;During Sept 11ths No Fly order, red ball is chased down by possible military aircraft & both vanish. a day or 2 after the sept 11, while the entire nation had a flight ban, i heard what sounded like a HUGE plane fly over town. i heard it approach our house and was able to still hear it after it passed town limits. since i knew no planes were suppose to be in the air i went out my front door which faces the south. i noticed what looked like a fire ball floating in the air staying in one spot. i watched as the plane that flew overhead & quickly appeared to get within a very short distance of the ball, the ball seemed to arch east. and then both the plane & ball disappeared.  it has been many weeks, so i hope i havent forgotten any important details.
