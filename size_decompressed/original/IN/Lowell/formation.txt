Seven orange lights in formation over Lowell Indiana in a staggered spread pattern.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-06 23:40:00;9 minutes;Seven orange lights in formation over Lowell Indiana in a staggered spread pattern. I saw a formation of orangish twinkling lights over Lowell Indiana on the night of May 6th 2020 at about 11:40pm. They were in a spread pattern, one flying by and then shortly after another following but farther away, and then another farther away like in a staggered spread pattern but evenly spaced. There were 7 that I saw this way but there could have been more before I noticed the first one. There were no flashing lights on these and no sound!  They were moving at a medium pace and at a fairly low altitude.;41.284;-87.4219
