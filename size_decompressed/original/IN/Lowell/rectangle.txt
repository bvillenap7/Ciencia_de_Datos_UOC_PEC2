I was driving along Interstate 65 northbound where there is a lot of open space, farmland, acres and acres of land.  I noticed how black the sky was and a few stars and saw something shaped like a rectangle, like the size of the windows on this form that we use to fill out information.  I was traveling about 70 MPH and saw this shaped traveling in the sky along side of the car. I thought it was a shooting star, but it didn't have a tail and it was airborne too long.  It never disappeared in the sky!!!!  As I slowed down, the object got closer and I was able to see it much clearer.  This object had several windows that were seperated by some kind of bar and very bright lights.    I was stunned by what I saw and pulled off the road to get a better look, but The craft disappeared.  My husband said there were several shooting stars and meteors sighted that night and airplanes were chasing the stars, but these were not stars and this was not an airplane.!!!!  It was some kind of craft!!!!!;41.284;-87.4219
