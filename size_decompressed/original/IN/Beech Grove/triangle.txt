Low flying slow moving, had red and white lights.;2014-01-29 02:00:00;1 1/2 minutes;low flying slow moving, had red and white lights. I was asleep when I awoke and saw an unusual bright light flickering from my window.  I sat up and saw a low flying aircraft, too low to be an airplane.  Reminded me of the height a motorized glider would fly.  I normally can hear when planes or helicopters go over the house, but this made no sounds.  There were red and white lights around it.  The white lights were bright and solid, the red ones flickered.  The aircraft didn't move fast, just slow and steady across the sky, appeared to come from over by 465 W and headed over the closed St. Francis Hospital.
