fireball i never seen anything like this before;2010-08-28 20:50:00;21:00;fireball i never seen anything like this before So we pulled up to my house and I get out of my brothers car his wife gets out too as well as 3 kids 1, 4 and a 6 years old.  My brother stayed in the car. as soon as we got out there was this fireball hovering over us it seem like it was 25 ft above us as we looked at it and started to point and talk about it and try to get my brother out the car it started to drift away pretty fast.  Within seconds it was a distance away and the fire went out the UFO went to black and started to slowly drift down like it was landing.  The trees got in the way and that was all we seen.  My brother got out the car so late that he didn’t see much of it so he thinks it was some government crap just to mess with our head.  I believe it’s a UFO I been begin for the day to see one and I finally did.  Now I want to see more of them.  I just wish I had a camera when I seen this.;39.7186;-86.099
