Strange lights in Northern Indiana sky.;2008-03-06 20:03:00;30 minutes;Strange lights in Northern Indiana sky. My husband was coming home from work and was talking to me on his cell phone and he said “Whoa, what the hell is that? What is that? I then asked my husband where he was and he stated, right down the road from our house.  I looked out our family room window which faces south and saw 3 bright red lights in a lined formation and some individual red lights. The 3 lights would turn and quickly disappear and reappear in a different location. These lights looked to be lower in the horizon and to the north of the reddish scattered lights, I saw a bunch of twinkling small white lights dancing around the sky almost in sequence. I can’t tell if the white lights were individual or were of a extremely large object, but the white lights consumed a huge part of the northwestern sky and lasted only about 30 seconds then disappeared. The red lights however, would reappear and disappear over the coarse of 30 minutes. We did call the law authorities and they stated that they were jets making maneuvers and dropping flares. I could understand that to some extent with the reddish lights being flares but these lights would come and go as if moving in the horizon and the lights would turn. The white sequenced twinkling lights, would be more difficult to explain.;41.2154;-86.4192
