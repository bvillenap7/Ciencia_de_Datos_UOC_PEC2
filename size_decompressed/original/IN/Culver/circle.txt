Three of us were on a pier by a large lake watching fireworks that were at one end of the lake to the west. It was very dark out, about 9:50 pm, and we noticed a perfectly round, very orange light or object moving slowly and steadily high above the treeline at the southeast side of the lake.  The object appeared to stop, then it &quotquivered&quot a little then went quickly in a direction somewhat up and away from where we were watching.  Several minutes later, it (or another one) appeared again in virtually the same area, moved along what seemed to be a similar path as the other one, stopped, then went directly east rather than in a more upward trajectory as the first one did.  We saw three more of these do virtually the same thing, all several minutes apart. Five friends came by boat after watching the fireworks from the water and they asked if we had seen that odd round orange object -- they had seen it from across the lake.  One of us is in aviation and said that it was definitely not an airplane. Nor was it a flare.  Additionally, some of the people who had been in the boat were out looking at the stars about a half hour after we had gone in and reported seeing the object higher in the night sky on the other side of the lake from where we all had originally seen it.  It looked just like a round tail light of an older truck, only it was the same color as an orange popsicle.;41.2154;-86.4192
