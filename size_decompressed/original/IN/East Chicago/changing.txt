We saw a falling fireball coming downwards, then it divided into 3 fireballs and they stop moving momentarily. The objects appeared oval shaped when still and we they continue to move sideways, they appeared as fireballs again. Another fireball appeared and did the same routine as the other set of objects. The objects didn't make any sound because it was a quiet night. Then they all vanished and didn't appear again. The color of the objects are bright yellow. The objects seemed to be over Gary, Indiana near Cline Ave. and Chicago Ave. There could possibly be more witnesses on this event due to cars driving near the area.;41.6349;-87.4627
