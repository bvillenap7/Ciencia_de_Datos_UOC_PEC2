I was in my drive way talking to my Dad and two younger brothers.  They were inside my Dad's pickup.  A bright white light lit up the entire sky like lightning, but there were no clouds.  I looked up and just to my left of the Big Dipper there were two bright orange streaks of light connected to a white circle with what appeared to be ripples (as best I can describe it).  I reached for my camera phone to take a picture, but within a matter of seconds the two bright streaks disappeared, from nearest the ground to the circle.  The circle disappeared when the streaks did.  I've seen many, many meteors, and this was not a meteor.  I've never seen anything like this before.;41.4681;-86.4744
Awestruck at the numerous air traffic on the 4th of July.;2012-07-04 23:00:00;3 hours;Awestruct at the numerous air traffic on the 4th of July. Some of them would start out with white lights and then turn to a red color, some were already red and then they would appear to disappear. There were too many to count.   After about 50, my husband said that they maybe jetfighters heading back from Chicago to Griffith after an airshow.  This started at 11pm and I went in around 2am and they were still continuing to fly over. They have no sound.  Very curious to find out if this was a hoax or just some sort of military exercise.;41.4681;-86.4744
