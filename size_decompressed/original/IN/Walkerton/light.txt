In the center it had a red light which never blinked or flashed. Around 9:55pm EST my Viper Car alarm went off by itself. I went to the window immediately thinkin someone might be messing around with my car. I went up to ask my brother about if he had seen anything he said no. So I went back down stairs and on my way back I looked out the window were I saw an object just hovering above a tree line. it sat there for a minute and turned off the 3 white lights then I could only see 1 red light which looked to be about the center of the object. I asked my brother to get out of bed to come take a look at it which was 10:00pm EST. We both looked at it then it moved to the right and turned on the 3 white lights again. Then it moved back and forth as if it were dangleing from a string. Then it turned off it's 3 white lights and started moving towards the east I went out and got in my car and tried to follow it. but once I got to it's location it was no where to be seen...;41.4681;-86.4744
When ever the objects where hit with the light from the flash light they got brighter.;2012-03-04 20:00:00;1 Hour;When ever the objects where hit with the light from the flash light they got brighter. My little sister went to let the dogs out and my dad decided to play with his strong flashlight.  He pointed it up into the sky at a random light.  When he flashed it the light got brighter.   Once he stopped the light got dimmer till it was barely noticeable.  He did it again and the object got brighter again.   Then we saw another light a small distance away and we shined the light at it it did the same exact thing as the other, the only thing different we noticed was it fully dissapered and then 10 minutes later it came back.;41.4681;-86.4744
