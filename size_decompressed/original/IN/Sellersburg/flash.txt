Could it have really been a UFO?;2005-02-11 02:00:00;5 sec;Could it have really been a UFO? I am 31 a mother of two and I usually get most of my work done after my kids go to sleep.  At about 2am, I was taking some boxes out to my shed. I am really not sure of what I seen, but I know I had a really scared feeling that it was not normal.  Coming from the east (lower) and shooting to the West (slightly upward) a bright white flash appeard for approx. 5 sec, not enough time for me to even try to comprehend what I just seen.  About 5 years ago I saw a shooting star at Nolin Lake, so at first so that I wouldn't freak out I told myself it must have been a shooting star, but it didn't look the same as the first one I saw. I am a person who has to see to believe and the night I saw the unknown flash, I began to think it could've been something I need to look into.  For some reason I kinda feel scared about telling anyone, not scared that they would not believe me but scared of what I saw could possibly harm me.;38.4043999999999;-85.7878000000001
