Star-like light seen over trees moving and changing direction towards constellation Orion;1999-08-11 05:25:00;25 seconds;Star-like light seen over trees moving and changing direction towards constellation Orion I looked outside before going to bed after working late (as usual) to see if I could see any meteors because of the meteor shower occuring right now.  It was still dark and I noticed a small jet plane fly by very low...extremely low actually.  It appeared to be a small passenger jet plane.  It made noise as it turned and gained altitude towards the south. After that I saw something just above the tree line but very far away that looked like a star with a red tint.  It was a little brighter than the brightest star in the orion constellation which was to the right of it by about 10 degrees from my vantage point.  Then I saw that the light was bobbing and moving left and right in an irregular fashion. It was changing direction and moving very quickly.  I watch it for about 20 seconds from my window as it moved around above the tree line and then decided to run outside to watch...when I got outside it was gone. I went back inside a looked for it for another 30 minutes from the window but it did not reappear.  I just wanted to report it in case there were other sightings.  It was brief but spooky. It was not moving in a smooth fashion as I've seen traditional aircraft move....it moved quickly up and down and left and right. From my perspective it appeared to move only an inch or two in relation to the trees....and if it hadn't been moving, I'd say it was a star.  If it hadn't appeared so long, I'd say it was a meteorite.  It did not appear to be a satellite because it changed directions.  The light emited from it was not blinking.;38.4043999999999;-85.7878000000001
