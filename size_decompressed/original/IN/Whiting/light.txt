Unnaturally moving blue lights. 2 of them!;2013-06-16 22:45:00;45 seconds;unnaturally moving blue lights. 2 of them! Was looking at direction of moon.  There was a high altitude blue light I thought was a shooting star, until it bounced-changed direction 90 degrees and startled me.  It then vanished towards an area about 20 degrees above the moons position.  As I kept looking for it, a second blue light looked like it got closer and brighter, then turned back and vanished. Scared the hell outta me. Nothing moves like that. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));41.6728;-87.502
