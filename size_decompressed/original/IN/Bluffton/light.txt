I was outside smoking a cigar with my girl when we saw 2 lights in the sky that were moving slowly. One going W to E other, E to NW.;2013-07-05 23:03:00;2 minutes;I was outside smoking a cigar with my girl when we saw 2 lights in the sky that were moving slowly.   One light was going west to east and the other going east to north west.  They were yellowish turning into a red color.   When they got close to each other, they shot straight up into the sky a vanished.   Now I don't believe in UFOs...I think it was a drone or NSA spy plane...but my girl insisted it was a UFO and that's why I'm posting on here.   I've never seen anything like this, kinda small looking but the fact the changed color and speed was kinda spooky.   Then about 5 minutes later seen planes in the sky.   Look like small planes but they were going in the same direction the lights went to. ((NUFORC Note:  Date corrected by source of report.  PD));40.7377;-85.162
