I was out side my house smoking a cig and letting my dog out. I walked to the street to grab a pop i had forgot in my car.  Then i herd a animal kill a bird nearly 75 yards behind me in my backyard neer the creek.  I knew it was a bird because i could her it squacking an flaping. My dogs hair stood up and she took off I yelled at her an took her inside.  Next I walked to the back side of my house to look out the windo to see if i could see any thing down at the creek much to my suprise i saw a bright blueish light in the shape of a sphere this light looked much like a shooting star but was much bigger an seemed to be in our atmosphere I live within a mile of the inner section of High Way 1 and 116 in IN, it seemed as if the object landed a just north of 116 and 10-20 miles east of 1.  I culd not determin the percice location for sure due to the tree line and hills. Not sure on the exact time but recently after i  saw this I muted the tv because i herd something,! it was a helicopter flying over the house heading in that direction. I have never seen anything like it an was ceriouse if any one else saw the same.;40.7377;-85.162
