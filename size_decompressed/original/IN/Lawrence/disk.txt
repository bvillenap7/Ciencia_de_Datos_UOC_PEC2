Slowly flying sphere had alternating blinking lights.;2019-12-23 23:42:00;1 minute;slowly flying sphere had alternating blinking lights A disk/saucer type object was slowly flying through the sky - over the neighborhood. Keep in mind that planes do not fly over this area especially not that close to the ground. It was still very high in the sky, but close enough for me to really see the shape.  This does not happen during the night with planes at all.  I only noticed it because of blinking lights I could see through my curtains.  I opened them up to get a better look.  the sphere had alternating blinking lights.  back and forth from white and red. It was heading east.;39.8621;-86.0115
