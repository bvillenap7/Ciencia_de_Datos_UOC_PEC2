It was an unusually big light, unlike any type of light on an airplane or helicopter.   It had only that one big light which stayed the same intensity and shape far in to the distant North West sky.  It was below the clouds and made no noise.   I am a 60 year old artist with 2 college degrees.;39.8621;-86.0115
