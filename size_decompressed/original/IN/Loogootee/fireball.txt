Orange fireball in western sky;2007-09-15 20:15:00;5 minutes;Orange fireball in western sky At approximately 8:15 pm on September 15, 2007 southwest Indiana. My daughter and I saw a large orange fireball low in the western sky. Seemed to be near a cell tower, and the ball was so bright that you could not see the tower light until the ball was gone. Stayed in one spot for several seconds then slowly faded until gone. A few minutes later it reappeared, much lower and to the east. Looked almost like it had changed shape. Again, the ball faded until gone. But, before it disappeared, there was a bright flash of light over the cornfield, much like someone had taken a flash photo. We have a video, but of course, itâ€™s not very good.;38.6624;-86.9160000000001
