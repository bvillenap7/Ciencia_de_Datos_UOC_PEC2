The ball was catching up to the jet rather fast and as the ball came within moments of collision with the aircraft,the jet then changed course immediately to a 60 or 70 degree angle in an upwardly direction.  The ball continued in a straight line then suddenly slowed as if it knew I was watching.  Then suddenly a cloud formed and was lost to sight.;39.5649;-84.8191
