Ball of light hung in sky then flew over.;2005-06-01 00:00:00;10 MIN.;Ball of light hung in sky then flew over. My friend told me she had recently seen a UFO [i got her info and reported it for her because she didnt want to give her address or phone number] so we decided to go to to a cemetary down the street from where i live and watch fro them from the parking lot.  We sat there fro prb. 30 mins. and saw nothing.  We were just getting ready to leave when we saw an orange glow in the sky.  we sat down and started watching. The glowing ball just sat in the sky for a while then flew over us. We saw the bottom of it. It was triangular in shape and had blue and red lights on the bottom. In about 2 mins. after that another flew over then another, We waited for a while but didnt see anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

It was so Bright...;2013-02-17 02:11:00;25 seconds;It was so Bright... On Sunday moring of Febuary 17th around 2:11 am central time myself and 3 others where traveling west bound on I-64 10 miles west of Coydon, Indiana.   As we was traveling at speeds of 72 mph I noticed a bright light in the north west sky traveling east in the sky.  As it came closer to us it begain to take shape of a trangle.  The largest point of it would have cover a full moon.   As it approched us i noticed that the light from it had luminated the ground and around us.   As i pulled over and step out the van the object went to the north on a very sharp turn.   No sound was heard, however the whole encounter was only about 25 secounds long.;38.2182;-86.1125000000001
Why are there silent aircraft flying over corydon at night? Also why are there so many going in the same direction?;2016-03-30 00:00:00;All night;Why are there silent aircraft flying over Corydon at night? Also why are there so many going in the same direction? Every night around 12:00am I notice lots of triangular shaped aircraft flying directly over Corydon.  These aircraft are completely silent and look like they are military.  I just think it's weird that they are silent and that I only see them at night as well as why there are so many passing.  I've been told it could be the military looking for a lost aircraft, but why? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
