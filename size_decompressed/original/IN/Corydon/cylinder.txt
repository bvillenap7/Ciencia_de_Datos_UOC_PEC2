Object spotted above western horizon when viewed from I-64 in Corydon, IN;2014-09-30 19:30:00;15 minutes;Object spotted above western horizon when viewed from I-64 in Corydon, IN I was driving westbound on Interstate 64 (altitude ~534ft) when the object was seen in fixed position just above horizon.  At first I thought it might be an airplane, satellite or possibly a star or sunset.  Unsure of how large the object actually was since it was too far off to get a realistic measurement, however it appeared to be hovering around the Evansville, IN area but it couldâ€™ve been much further west when viewed directly from I-64, it was definitely large, oblong and stationary in the western sky.  It had an oblong-oval / cigar shape and appeared bright white in color such as found with a star or a satellite / metallic object reflecting sunlight.  I viewed it for approx. 15 minutes before exiting highway (exit 105) and it was still in the same location fixed on the western horizon when viewed directly down the I-64 corridor.
