I need to talk to the U.F.O. center asap.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax??  PD));2008-01-19 08:00:00;17 seconds;I need to talk to the U.F.O. center asap. When I was riding home with my mom I took two pictures of something flying in the sky, it wasn't a plane because it didn't have blinking lights.  So when we pulled in the driveway I saw a BIG disk so I got my Razor cell phone and put it on the vido taper and   taped a disk flying around a star.  And I got another picture from 12-11-07. Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax.  We will invite the person to submit the photo.  PD));38.2182;-86.1125000000001
