White ball of light, erratic movement, sudden dissapearence.;2006-12-20 07:20:00;20 seconds;White ball of light, erratic movement, sudden dissapearence. I saw a white ball of light moving up and down erratically just above the treeline while I was riding my bus to school. The object was moving fast and as I watched it, it sped up and dissapeared behind the trees for a interval of around 2 seconds. It reappeared then vanished. I watched for it to return but it didn't. Many craft of this kind are sen in my area. It's a phenomenon referred to as the Corydon Lights. Many teachers at my school, among other adults, have actually talked about seeing them, they are popular enough to even be mentioned in a Topics class at my highschool.;38.2182;-86.1125000000001
Single point of light that changed direction and rose out of sight within a second;2011-06-15 23:30:00;3 minutes;Single point of light that changed direction and rose out of sight within a second I thought I was watching a satellite passing overhead, as I've seen many times before. I watched the ISS pass overhead one night, and this looked just the same as a satellite.  I watched it for approx. 3 minutes, moving in a straight line and at the same speed.  It then changed direction at approx. 90 degrees vertically and increased speed dramatically as it climbed out of sight within approx 1 - 1 1/2 seconds.;38.2182;-86.1125000000001
