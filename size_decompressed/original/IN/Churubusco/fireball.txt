Cluster of red lights in the Churubusco sky;2011-10-29 21:00:00;3 min;Cluster of red lights in the Churubusco sky I was tending our camp fire in our back yard around 10 pm Saturday night when I turns to look back at the house when I saw eight or so red lights hovering over our neighborhood.  The light moved at a constant speed for two to three minutes and then all of them “burned out”.  About one to two minutes later, two more red lights, independent of each other also appeared in the sky.  They also moved to about the same location in the sky before “burning out”.  The first set of lights moved very slowly and almost in a circular rotation.  The second set moved in a more linear direction.;41.2291;-85.3295
