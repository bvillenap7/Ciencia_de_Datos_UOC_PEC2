Hovering object over Noble county IN.;2011-07-20 01:30:00;10 mins;Hovering object over Noble county IN. Object was at a high altitude impossible to make out it's shape,  Object hovers for 5-10 mins then disappears,  appears to be slightly swaying but does not move in any major direction,  appears to have red lights on top and bottom and very bright white light in center. I have observed this same object over a period of months on random occasions but seems to show up between 1am - 3am.  One occasion I did observe two objects but have only seen the one ever since.
