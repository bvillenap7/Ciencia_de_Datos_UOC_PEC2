I seen a big shadow of a hawk or vulture that seemed close.   ((anonymous report));2017-05-07 13:00:00;5 minutes;Was cutting grass on rider, when I seen a big shadow of a hawk or vulture that seemed close, so I looked up didn't see the bird but something way up caught my eye it looked like a spotlight or something reflecting.   It looked like it wasn't moving at first, but it was slowly moving southeasterly.  It was way past a nearby chem-trail and very small I thought it might be the space station.  It moved at about that pace.  I did not think a person could see that far in the daytime hours. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.
