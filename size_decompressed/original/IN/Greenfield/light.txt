Three lights in the shape of a triangle.;1978-09-01 21:15:00;15 - 20 minutes;Three lights in the shape of a triangle. I was looking at this web sight for the first time and saw an event entered 5/1/2005 that must be the same event that I experienced.  The writer dated the event 5/12/1980 but said he wasn't sure.  I think the event was approximately September of 1978 or 1979.  I was 16 or 17 and driving home from work on interstate 70.  I was headed east from Indianapolis to Greenfield.   I would say somewhere between the Mt. Comfort Rd. exit and the Greenfield exit, I saw 3 lights in a triangular shape.  The lights were primarily white but I do remember some occasional red and blue.  It would have been around 9:15 based on where I was on my trip home.  The lights moved in relation to each other and formed different sizes of the same triangle. I exited interstate 70 at Greenfield and turned north on highway 9.  I then went approximately 1 mile until I reached 300 north and turned west. (I was still headed home)  Very shortly after I turned onto 300 north, I could see something above me.  I have always described it as a density.  It was too close above me to make out a shape.  When I looked up, it was big enough that I couldn't see sky on any side of the object.  I have also always said it was probably bigger that two 2 story houses.  I have also said it would be like standing under a large passenger jet, that is on the ground, and looking up.  You could just see the underneath.  I couldn't see the lights at that time and I could not make out the color of the object, just that there was something above me. There was no sound. I am guessing this lasted for just a few seconds until I drove past it.  I went home and made it by my normal time which was approximately 9:30.  I told my parents and they could tell I was visibly excited.  The next morning, I was sitting in my high school home room and they came over the intercom and said the National Enquirer was in the office and wanted to interview anyone having seen a UFO.  I did not go because I was too embarrassed to get up in front of the home room.  I do not know if anybody went.  That evening, the Greenfield Daily Reporter ran a front page article.  In that article, it reported finding markings in a field.  These markings were found somewhere on the opposite side of highway 9 than I had turned.  I turned to the west of 9 and these were found on the east of 9 and at about the same area as 300 north.  I feel it must have been headed east when I saw it.  I match my dates due to where I was working.  I really felt it was in the fall because of feeling new in the home room class.  I did go back to the Hancock County Library a couple of years ago and tried to find the paper.  I was unable to find any article, but I did concentrate on the fall only.  I will make an attempt to go back soon and start checking all of 1978 and 1979.  I will also check to make sure that all of the papers are there.

Bright Spherical light seen over Hancock County field, disappears;1980-05-12 21:00:00;60 seconds;Bright Spherical light seen over Hancock County field, disappears I was very young when this happened but the event was witnessed by three other people including my mother, my older sister, and my older brother.  In the evening hours roughly between 8:00 and 9:00 P.M. in the summer of 1980 or 81 (the year is sketchy for me because I was only about 5 years old at the time) My mother, brother and I were on our way to pick up my older sister from a friends house on the backroads of Hancock County, Indiana. It was only a few miles from home on the way back when my mother stopped the car and turned off the motor and began frantically rolling down the window.  My brother and I were in the backseat and my sister had shotgun. My brother and I enquired as to why we stopped and my mother told us to look through the windshield directly in front of us. Upon looking ahead all four of us saw what appeared to be a large round white light moving very slowly and low to the ground from right to left crossing the road in front of us.  My mother was trying to get the window down to see if it made a noise, it appeared not to. When it finally reached the other side of the road above a field the object blinked out like someone flipping a switch and as quick as it appeared it was gone. We were all in awe and a little frightened by this.  We did not report this to anyone outside our family, my mother being worried we might become the town kooks or something but we found out later we were not the only ones who witnessed this object. Apparently a farm family had a terrifying experience a little earlier that evening and had reported it to some sort of investigators I am not sure who, and a burned circular imprint was found in a field close to the family's farm.  To the best of my recollection this object somewhat harrassed the family by hovering near the home for quite a long time. I believe this sighting was reported and could maybe be found in some Greenfield newspaper archives. I have always wanted to report this sighting because the farmer family were not the only witnesses to this astonishing occurence. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  We will invite the witness to attempt to locate the articles.  PD));39.7891;-85.8094000000001
Light object in sky during day time on 10/9/13 in Greenfield, IN,;2013-10-09 17:30:00;~10 minutes;Light object in sky during day time on 10/9/13 in Greenfield, IN In Greenfield, IN.  Approximately above the Mt. Comfort airport. (believe it was recently renamed). It was daylight outside and I looked up and saw an object that was stationary in the sky but it seemed to be flashing on and off.  My mom and sister both saw the object and were wondering what the light was.  It couldn't have been a star because like I said previously, it was still daylight, around 5:00 or 6:00 pm.  I went and grabbed my binoculars to get a better look of the object and surprisingly it was still there for the time it took me to find them.  The object was still disappearing and reappearing as if it was blending in with the sky. I was finally able to get a look at it with my binoculars and I saw two dark circular objects that were in a formation (one was above and the other was below).  I lost track of them through the binoculars and looked back up into the sky without them and it was gone.;39.7891;-85.8094000000001

Bright light hovers then shoots upwards.;2014-12-03 18:42:00;10-15 seconds;Bright light hovers then shoots upwards. My sister and I were in our car at a stop sign at our local Walmart.  In the sky before us was a bright light that seemed to be staying still or maybe hovering.   My sister asked, bewildered, Is that a light or a very bright star?  The sky was very dark and there were no visible stars at the time.   Then, the light started going upwards at a slow speed and we turned, heading home.  We were staring at it, turning our heads and craning our necks, just as it shot up into the air and the light was gone.  We were thinking it was a UFO.;39.7891;-85.8094000000001
