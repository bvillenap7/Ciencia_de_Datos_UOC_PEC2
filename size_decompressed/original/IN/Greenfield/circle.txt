Silver object following plane formation.;2002-07-25 14:00:00;1 minute;Silver object following plane formation. This was a sunny afternoon.  The date is approximate.  But it was before the Mt Comfort Air Show at the Mt Comfort airport which is about 3 miles from my house.  I heard the sound of planes coming over the house. Since some pretty old WWII planes come over I wanted to get a closer look. I was on the screen porch, so I went out in the yard to watch the formation of planes go over.  There were 3 planes lined up going overhead.  They were going southeast.  I noticed a silver object keeping up with the last plane.  Then that plane did a turnaround heading back to the object.  When it got near the silver cirle or round dot the object just disapeared. As the planes were going southeast it seemed to keep up to them at the rear.  But when that plane turned around, it held back and went up and disapeared.  I immediately went in and told my husband that I saw something I couldn't explain.  It has intrigued me ever since.;39.7891;-85.8094000000001
