Looking into the northern sky, three dim lights in form of a tight triangle zoomed across the sky in a northern direction then with a quick swoop went into a northwest direction.  It was too fast for an airplane, the lights were not flashing, no sound.  The lights itself was not bright almost in a transparent sort of form.  I have never seen anything like this before and it only lasted like 30 seconds or so.;40.7595;-86.3596
