50 ft. sphear over farm house moved off exces of mach1 visible untill fading out of sight.;1978-07-01 22:00:00;30 seconds;50 ft. sphear over farm house moved off exces of mach1 visible untill fading out of sight. I was driving with my mother unfortunatld now deceasedgoing east on the road just south of the wabash rivver when we came around to see a sphear aproximatly 50 foot in diamiter about 1/4 mile ahead of us setting stationary above a farm house about 15 to 20 feet over the chinmey it was glowing orange apeared to be perfectly smooth and was giving off enough light to iluminate the house and outline of the barn. At that point my mother said look at that moon and I said that is no moon however it was the clasic color of the rising harvest moon.At that point it started moving south and up at about 30 degrees. It made no sound and excelerated at a tremendous rate in a strate line turning continuously lighter in color untill it apeared to be no more than a star that continued in the same direction untill it was to far and faint to see.This took no more than 20 seconds from the time that it started to move. I am rather certin on the size as it's dianiter was as close as i was able to toll the same as the top of the roof.I have been in the military and it was not a plane or conventional air craft.it made no manoover other than a strate line it made no sound although it had obviously exceaded the sound barier several times.I now work in electronics and know of no way of doing this. It was a solid object below the high tree line it had no markings or visible openings. it was not a reflection and when we aproched it was aparent that it was centered above the house that is still standing. and to the bottom was not over 45 feet off the ground.

On 4-16-2004 I saw a huge sphere shaped object that had six lights in the sky over Logansport and it remained for several seconds.;2004-04-16 08:58:00;approx. 1 min;On 4-16-2004 I saw a huge sphere shaped object that had six lights in the sky over Logansport and it remained for several seconds. We were going down 24 west toward Lake Cicott, Indiana when out the window I saw lights glowing we pulled over so we would not wreck.  Several people in front of us put on their brake lights as well.  There in front of us was 6 glowing lights looked like amber fire balls.  It hovered for several seconds to maybe a minute and during this time the lights flashed on and off a couple of times.  When I realized what was happening I called the radio station with no reply than I called the Sherriffs department and they informed me they had several different calls.  As I was talking to them explaining what I had seen I saw lights again this time further away from me and I told them what I was seeing.  It looked like they were being chased or something.  When we called in regards to this matter today 4-17-2004, they have now stated it was the military practicing war games.  I do not beleive this because I know what I saw.;40.7595;-86.3596
Orange Lights in the Sky;2005-03-21 21:00:00;10 Minutes;Orange Lights in the Sky It was 9 pm - 10pm my family and I had left the theater. As we were driving home, I happened to see two orange lights up in the sky to the SouthWest. I was looking at them, and after we had went around a building they were gone. A few minutes later, the rest of my family in the car had spotted the lights. We sat in the car for a few minutes and watched the lights. There were 3 - 6 of these and they began circling around one another. Again they had disappeared. We waiting a little while longer and saw nothing, so we went to the house. My father and I were curious and went outside to look some more. We stood outside and a few minutes later we saw the lights once more. This time the lights were lined up and each blinked on then off once. That was the last we saw of them. We also saw a few passenger air planes but they were not any where near the lights.
