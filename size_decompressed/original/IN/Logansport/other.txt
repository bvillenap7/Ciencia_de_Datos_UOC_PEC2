I took a break from the study for about two hours.  When I went back to resume the study on this signal.  All information on this new signal from the different internet sites was completely removed.  Don't we have the right to know about this latest radio telescope signal?   Whoever is in control of the internet information is trying to stop the public from being aware of this latest signal!
