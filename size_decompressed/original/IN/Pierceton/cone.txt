Was sitting on porch having coffee with a friend when I noticed an odd color in the sky to the n/ne of us.  It appeared stationery, not moving as an aircraft would.  Aircraft was also in the sky & you could tell they were moving.  I got my binoculars to observe it and saw there were 5 objects, 1 with very bright lights & 4 with the same pattern of lights but dimmer.  Lights were rotating (like the road signs that go from one side to the other) clockwise but the brightest one was barely moving in a counter-clockwise pattern.  The lights on all objects were red, green, yellow and white..in order on an outer band.  The lights appeared synchonized.  Lighting was same on all of them.  The largest object was circular with a slightly domed top that looked like an open super structure on a building.  We watched these objects for approx 45 minutes & then, suddenly, they disappeared.  Later that evening other people in the community called & asked if we had seen this. I am a 35 yr old professional long distance truck driver.  My friend is a 38 yr old housewife, her husband also came out to see it.  He is a 44 yr old computer specialist.  Others who called to say they had seen it was the wife and daughter of a local pastor.;41.2123;-85.7097
