Spherical on one side, diamond on the other with the axis of rotation along the flat diamond side.;1982-06-22 08:30:00;~ 5 minutes;Spherical on one side, diamond on the other with the axis of rotation along the flat diamond side. Mother of two, ages 8 and 4?, was leaving for piano lessons on this Tuesday morning.  All three of them witnessed it (this is a friend posting this for the mother).  The object was metallic and silvery, and on one side it was spherical, and the back(?) side was flat and in the shape of a diamond.  The object was rotating on an axis that went through the center of the diamond side.  The rate of rotation was estimated at 1 revolution per 45 to 60 seconds.  Initially the object was moving away from their vehicle.  It went a distance away, and then the direction of its rotation changed, and began to move back towards them.  Soon there- after, the son (age 4) became very upset by its coming to them, and then the object just disappeared...no sound or anything.  On the flat diamond side of the object there was a black (amorphous) pattern around its center.  In the center of this side was a steady blue light. The total viewing time was about 5 minutes. After the object was gone, all three individuals went back inside the house and in separate rooms drew what they thought they saw.  The drawings agreed with each other. The father was disbelieving, and disheartedly, the mother ended up throwing the sketches away.  The 8 yr. old daughter still remembers seeing the object, but doesn't think much about it. The mother still thinks often about it.  There area at the time used to have a lot of air traffic, but there was none at the time.  Size of the object was estimated to be about the size of the 'bubble' of a small helicopter.;39.9904;-86.7518
