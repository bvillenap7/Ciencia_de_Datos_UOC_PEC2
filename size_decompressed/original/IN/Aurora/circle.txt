Several orange lights moving steadily across the sky June 2, 2012 at about 10:30 p.m.  We were driving up a hill into the Wal Mart parking lot in Aurora Indiana when several orange lights caught our eye.  Entering the lot we noticed several people standing by their cars looking up at the lights. The first 3 rows we saw had 3 lights in a line.  As they moved across the sky more and more appeared and continued to move steadily.  I can't say how many there were before we noticed them but we saw at least 20 and when we went into the store they continued to appear. I have never seen anything like this but in looking online found pictures from many other places that were very much the same.;39.075;-84.9459

I couldn’t sleep so I whent out onto the step landing to smoke it had rained and I could more stars than usual I was looking to the south west and saw a reddish orange ball appear on the horizon as it came closer I could see a lack band around it . There was only one what I thought was a cloud and this was right over my head, when the ball was about half way to the cloud another ball appears and then another and another til there were7 about then #1 interned the cloud .  I had been studying the cloud and could see vertical strips the full width of it the first ball flew into it and didn’t come.out the other balls were flying in A zigzag or staggered formation and other than 1 disappearing from.one side and appearing on the out side looked like they were touching and flew like that for about a min.  There was no sound nor exterior lights when the trailing edge of the last object interned the cloud the cloud balls and all disappeared quicker than you could blink your eye;39.075;-84.9459
