Multiple reddish orange shimmering lights rose from behind a hill, moved west to east, and disappeared in the sky.;2016-09-16 22:30:00;10 minutes;Multiple reddish orange shimmering lights rose from behind a hill, moved west to east, and disappeared in the sky. A group of lights rose from behind a distant hill and moved west to east before disappearing. There were about 15 lights in total, with 10-12 lights visible at any one time.  The lights were reddish orange in color and appeared to flicker or shimmer but did not blink or flash. The lights rose one by one and followed a similar trajectory through the sky, rising from behind a hill about 2 miles away, and leveled off at varying, yet similar, altitudes while moving west to east. Their speed seemed to be much slower than that of a typical airplane the objects had a floating quality to their movement. After moving to the east, the objects, one by one, at different times but at the same place in the sky, dimmed and disappeared. There was no sound associated with the objects. The lights were steady throughout the time they were visible and did not blink or flash as a typical aircraftâ€™s lights would.  When I first noticed the lights, there were 10 in the sky, with additional lights rising for a total of about 15. Several other witnesses were seen taking pictures of the objects with their smartphones. I am an English teacher and aviation enthusiast, familiar with typical aircraft lighting and movement patterns.
