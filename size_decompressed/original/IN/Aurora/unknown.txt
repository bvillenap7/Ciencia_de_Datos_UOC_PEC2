Approximately 20:00 hrs., SE of my home, was an odd object in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius?? PD));2016-01-02 20:00:00;75 minutes;Approximately 20:00 South East of my home was an odd object in the sky.  What caught my eye was a shooting star.  When watching it fall, I noticed this object that was flashing multiple colors.  I live near a big airport so I stood outside and watched for a moment.   After twenty minutes of watching, I noticed it was not moving.  When airplanes from the airport would come close to the object, the lights would dim and it would move to my right in a straight line.  Once the plane was away from the object it would Brighton up and the colors would be vivid again.  The was a plane shape object that came up from behind and was circling it.I watched it for an hour.   I looked outside at 21:00 and it moved South.  The object is still flashing multiple colors.  I looked outside at 21:15 and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius?? PD));39.075;-84.9459
