I was heading northbound in my car when I looked to the west to see 5 bright orange lights in a line up the sky.  They were about the size of a half dollar at an arm's length.  Intensity was a little more than a street light.  I was heading to my girlfriends house and I had to turn eastbound.  So I repedidly stuck my head out my window to look back at the lights which appeared to slowly be moving up the sky.  After doing this for about 5 mins I looked back again and the lights were gone.  I arrived at my girlfriend's house to find her with her neighbors on the back porch who had been watching the same thing.  They claimed that the lights were swaying as they moved up the sky and 2 of them looked like they exploded and there were bright white sparks when this happened.  The rest of the lights then slowly faded out.  There were 6 witnesses in all, me, my girlfriend, her sister, and three neighbors.  There did also seem to be a large number of aircraft in the sky that night and I couldnt tell but some of them may had been heading towards the lights.;41.6746;-86.0851
