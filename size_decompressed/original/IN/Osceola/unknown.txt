It had red, green and white light that rotated making it seem this was almost round.  He watched it for 20 minutes as it did not move.  It just hung in the same place. Looked like it was shaking a little. He got me and I watched it through binoculars.  The lights were indeed rotating colors and very bright through the lens.  It hung in the same place for at least 1.5 hours.  I tried to charge up the recorder and laid down while it was charging. I did get it a little on cell phone but can barely see it, though you can see something.  It was far away.  When we got up it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));41.6746;-86.0851
