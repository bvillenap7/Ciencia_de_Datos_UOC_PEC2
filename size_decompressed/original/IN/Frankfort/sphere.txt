3 glowing objects near Frankfort, IN, in Dec. 2002;2002-12-10 19:30:00;15 min;3 glowing objects near Frankfort, IN, in Dec. 2002 My husband and I were driving about 10 miles south of Frankfort, IN.  We were headed toward Frankfort.  I was talking to him and as I was talking, I noticed some balls of light in the sky.  I continued talking while watching the lights when my husband interrupted me to ask if I saw those lights.  We then watched them for about 5 or 10 more seconds when they just disappeared, as if the lights had been turned off.  At first I thought that there was a tree between us and the lights, but after about 10 more seconds we still had not passed any trees along the side of the road.  We looked all around but could not see them anywhere.  My husband saw two balls of light and I thought that I had seen another one briefly to the left of the larger ball.  There was one large ball of light and another smaller one to the right.  The light was a kind of yellowish with pinkish tones.  They appeared to be about one half mile away.  They were maybe about the same altitude as a small plane, or maybe a bit lower.  About 7 or 8 minutes later, we were just outside the Frankfort city limits when my husband saw them again.  This time there were three distinct balls of light, one a bit larger than the other two.  They seemed farther away the second time.  The larger one's light got bright and then dimmed, like a dimmer switch, and then brightened briefly again.  Then it dimmed and went out.  All three balls of light went out at the same time.  We called my son-in-law at the Tippecanoe County Sherriff's dept. to see if anyone was reporting a similar experience.  He called one of the Frankfort police.  However, there were no other reports made.;40.3044;-86.4689
