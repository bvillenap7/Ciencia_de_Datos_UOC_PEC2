Lights;2007-05-24 22:00:00;5  to 10 sec;My husband and I was in our pick up truck southwest of Frankfort, In. It was right at dusk. Not quite dark yet. We was backing out of a field near a wooded area as I looked out my opened window towards the back of the truck I saw 6 lights in a row in this clouded area near us.  The lights were compared to a car head light but was a yellow-gold color.  They did not move, they were just there for maybe 5 to 6 sec then they faded away from left to right one at a time.  As we backed onto the road I would not take my eyes off of the very spot that I saw them. I saw a very dim outline of a rectangle with the same lights but very dim to the eye. I just saw that for a few sec and it just faded away.  I was relieved to hear my husband say that he saw the lights too.;40.3044;-86.4689
Balls of spinning lights making weird shapes and a earthquake.;2008-09-17 21:15:00;10 minutes;balls of spinning lights making weird shapes and a earthquake. bright balls of light spinning disapearing and reapearing in lines staying in one spot then moving horizontily and vertically then it took off towards kokomo then 2 jets flew over the same direction like they were trying to catch it but they were to slow.   And then i heard on the scanner they had an explosion in kokomo and they couldn't find any dibree or figure out what it came from then in the morning we had an earthquake then the goverment said it was jets leting off flares so they dropped flares that night to show what it was but it was not the same thing and the goverment said all jets were on the ground at grissom airforce base at 10:15 pm that night but the explosion didn't happen until 15 minutes after that and i was watching them fly over before they reached kokomo. iv'e seen these same crafts for 15 years.;40.3044;-86.4689
