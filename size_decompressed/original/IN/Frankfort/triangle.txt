Triangle Shape Over Frankfort Indiana;1998-03-14 21:00:00;2 minutes;Triangle Shape Over Frankfort Indiana hi i know its been awhile since i seen this thing i never really wanted to write in but i have to because what i seen was clearly not a plane helicopter or anything like that i have seen in my life we was visiting my uncle at his house i was on the front porch around 8:00 pm when i looked up i seen something very huge in shape moving very slow it was in the shape of a triangle it moved directly over my head so i could make out every single detail of it on the front of this triangle looked like around 10-15 bright spotlights half way down this odject was a circular cutout it was hallow towards the middle i could look right through the inside and see the stars overhead that was really strange because i know of nothing like that in any of our military/civilian aircraft this event lasted around 2 minutes i went back inside the house and told everyone to come look on the front porch with me but only one other person came outside to look for himself and at the back og this thing was another set of around 10-15 bright spotlights whats strange is there was no sound what so ever it was low enough to us we should have heard something there was nothing this was something that really took my breath i cannot explain what it was except to say it was not a military craft or civilian either one.....
