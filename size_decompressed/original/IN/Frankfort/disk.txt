It was above a forest on the horizon. It was a large saucer. When i looked at it for a few seconds it instantly fell out of view. Later on that night i had a dream about it. In the dream there were many more and it was like something was trying to contact me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.3044;-86.4689
Bright Light In Frankfort INDIANA;2006-08-14 01:00:00;5-10 minutes;Bright Light In Frankfort INDIANA Well at 1:00 that night we saw a light we just thought it was nothing. The light was long and grew size as light progressed. It was white in color. This encounter didn't last very long. We ran inside. So I went back outside to see if I could see it again. I did that time it was long and still grew in size as it progressed. Except I saw something that was a disk shape inside of the light. Also, this time it was pulsating green and red. My encounter lasted about 30 seconds.;40.3044;-86.4689
