Late at night, out in the country at a friend’s house a bunch of kids from church were camping in her backyard.  She casually pointed up and we all saw bronze fiery lights in the sky.  She wasn’t surprised, she said she saw UFO’s all the time out there.  We stood there and watched the lights move around in different formations, usually in a line.  They were beautiful and looked like they were dancing gracefully at one point. They moved very slow sometimes.  Accelerated very quickly.  At one point some of them moved so far across the sky I knew I was looking at something I have never ever seen before, no plane or helicopter can move so quickly.  They also slightly changed color from bronze to white.  They were so far away we couldn’t truly see what they were, just balls of fire like stars that had come alive.  Eventually they all took off, one by one, very quickly, and disappeared .;40.3044;-86.4689
Stationary orange lights in sky NE of Frankfort, Indiana on 2/25/07;2007-01-25 19:10:00;15 minutes;Stationary orange lights in sky NE of Frankfort, Indiana on 2/25/07 Clear skies tonight.  First saw three orange balls in lower sky NE of Frankfort, IN Two were small, one large. Approx. 25 degrees up from where I was standing.  Bright at first then faded away after 5 - 8 seconds.  About 6 - 8 minutes later saw four orange balls higher in the sky, all appeared separately and further apart and faded away seaparatley (within 1 - 2 seconds of each other).  These were approx. 40 degrees up from my point of reference.  Total lapse of time 6 - 8 seconds.  None appeared to be moving...very stationary.  About 5 minutes later saw one orange ball very high (approx. 75 degrees up and now more NW of Frankfort) in the sky, same fade in/fade out over 5 seconds.  No sound.  5 minutes later saw two pair of jet aircraft (could hear them) flying in pairs criss cross the area of sky where I saw the orange balls. Jet aircraft had one white strobe light each.  Then one prop aircraft flew low through the area with multiple lights.  Returned to my car and drove home. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he sounded exceptionally sober-minded and credible to us.  Please see second report from Indiana for the same incident.  We allow for the possibility that the objects may be part of a military operation, and we have encouraged the witnesses to investigate that possibility.  PD));40.3044;-86.4689
