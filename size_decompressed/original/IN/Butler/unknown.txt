Two close lights, first dim and second twice as bright with occaisional flare up, non-blinking.;2014-02-27 19:30:00;3-5 minutes;Two close lights, first dim and second twice as bright with occaisional flare up, non-blinking. On February 27th, 2014, at approximately 1930-1935hrs, I Mr. ((initial deleted)) and Ms. ((initial deleted)) observed two lights moving across the dusk sky heading in a northeastern direction.  We both had just arrived home and I was making an observation of the how there were multiple chem-trails in the evening sky that were going east to west.  This is not uncommon as we live in the north eastern part of Indiana and itâ€™s a common occurrence, I believe we are on an air-route for Detroit, thus explaining the high volume of airplanes.  As we were searching the entire night sky I first observed the lights coming from the southwest and heading towards the northeast. What caused me to question these lights was the fact that they were moving across the sky in tandem, staying in what seemed a constant spacing and being in close proximity to each other.  I held my hand up and would estimate that they were two inches apart.  If the sky line is 180 degrees, we first saw them at about 120-130 degrees and finally lost sight of them at approximately 20-30 degrees.  My observations lasted between 3-5 minutes until I lost sight. Also the other strange observation that I witnessed was the fact that the two lights were not blinking as compared to all of the other 5-7 planes that were blinking in the night sky.  The first of the two lights was dim and the second light was twice as bright.  The second light also would flare up very bright, every 20 seconds or so. Thank you for your time.

Flashing, stationary white light in eastern sky;2014-10-09 20:20:00;5 minutes;Flashing, stationary white light in eastern sky At approximately 8:20 pm EDT in northeastern Indiana, a flashing white light appeared in the eastern sky.  There was a jet that traveled completely across the sky near the object.  The jet moved from horizon to horizon while the object stayed stationary in the sky.  The light size and intensity was very much like the jets.  The lights also flashed at about the same interval as the jet.  The sighting lasted about 5 minutes.  It was in the eastern sky as the moon was coming over the horizon.;41.4254;-84.8876
