white light traveling fast from south to north then disappearing;2008-04-16 23:59:00;2 mins;white light traveling fast from south to north then disappearing I was standing outside smoking looking up at the stars (like usual) at around midnight. I saw a solid white light traveling from the south (behind me) to north then disappearing. This took no longer than 2 minutes. There was a jet (commercial plane) flying from east to west. The jet took ten about minutes to travel the distance that the light did. I saw the flashing lights on the jet like normal. I did not see any flashing lights on the other (solid white light) just one solid light. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  We suspect that the sighting may have occurred near midnight, April 16, and we have amended the time and date above, to reflect that fact.  PD));41.4254;-84.8876
