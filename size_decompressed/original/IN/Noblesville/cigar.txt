Cigar shaped object with red beam hovers for 45min during storm;2002-06-25 21:10:00;45 min;Cigar shaped object with red beam hovers for 45min during storm There was a very slow moving storm with lots of heat and bolt lightning with heavy rain. To the North East was a bright light hovering just over the tree line with a red beam shooting to the ground out of the South side of the object that had balls of white light going down through it. The red beam did not stay on constantly, just every now and then it would shoot down. We watched this for probably 15 min and then I went and got a small pair of binoculars but when I looked through I could see what looked like either panels of light or windows across the body of the object. I couldn't really tell for sure. I did not see it fly away, it just wasn't there any more after about 45 min. I don't know if that was do to the clouds going by. Soon after that there was a very strong smell of gasoline on our screened in porch and there was no explanation for it. There was no one else outside and there weren't any cars on the street it just smelled like gasoline out there for several seconds.;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001
