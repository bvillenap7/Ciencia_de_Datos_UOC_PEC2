Dull red flashes seen in daytime in various parts of sky.;2002-12-08 15:30:00;flash;Dull red flashes seen in daytime in various parts of sky. Several times starting this summer while looking west out of my picture window to the field across our county road, I saw dull red flashes occuring 1-5 times a minute about 15 to 30 degrees off of the horizon.  The red flashes mostly happen in the same locations . Looking out the window the red flashes occur within a 45degree angle on the horizontal plane from my perspective.  I know the surrounding area very well and tracking the source of these flashes eludes me.  I look through binoculars at times and looking at the direction where the red flashes occur the  sky seems to shimmer like looking across heat of a fire.  My wife refuses to look out the window because she say's she has other things to worry about and that I can't do anything about it anyway.   This thinking puzzels me, very frustrating.;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001
