A  vary fast moving Jupiter size light, looking north in central Indiana going east to west for about 6-10 seconds.;2000-10-31 18:30:00;5-10 sec.;A  vary fast moving Jupiter size light, looking north in central Indiana going east to west for about 6-10 seconds. While my neighbor and I were walking the kids trick or treating, I looked north and saw what seemed to be at a far distance looking to be the size of Jupiter. This light was traveling at a very high rate of speed going east to west. As I looked up and seen this object, I had to focus and realize what I was seeing, I then pointed it out to my neighbor who then saw it for several seconds. This was absolutely not a plane. Plus, there was no meteor tail at all to be seen. I spend a many nights outside looking up for any thing that moves, and have never seen anything move at that rate besides a meteor moving a bit faster. But the length of the movement was much longer than any meteor I've seen.;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001
Moving light that slowed down, stopped, stood still and then disappeared.;2004-03-18 20:00:00;3 min;Moving light that slowed down, stopped, stood still and then disappeared. I was taking my dogs out I just moved into a new development and there's a field behind my house.  I looked up and saw a light moving across the sky left to right.  I thought it was a plane, but you could see planes and they had blinking lights.  I read yesterday there would be an asteroid you could see from earth so I thought maybe that was it.  I kept watching it and it slowed down.  Asteroids don't do that.  Then it stopped.  I wanted to run inside to get my coat. As I was going in the back door I had a feeling if I turned around it would be gone.  I took another look at it through the screen door and it wasn't moving.  I ran to get my coat, maybe 20 seconds when I came back out it was gone.  I ran to the field and looked in every direction, but it was gone.  Weird!;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001

Very bright white star like object slowly moves across the sky intercepted by a blinking red light.;2013-06-04 04:57:00;3 minutes;Very bright white star like object slowly moves across the sky intercepted by a blinking red light. Walking the dog looking at the stars on a very clear morning I saw a very bright star moving north.  The light was about 20 times brighter than the brightest star and singularly bright white with no other colors visible. It never twinkled or varied in brightness as it traveled very slowly across my sky view.  I stopped walking to verify that it was indeed moving and not my imagination. I noticed that it had a very unusual trajectory.  It seemed to meander a little east and west never moving in a straight line.  From the south I observed a blinking red lighted aircraft that I now think was a terrestrial air craft approaching the bright star.  I started realizing something was odd when the blinking red light came in very close airspace to the star and appeared to tag along with it.  The blinking red light had a very straight trajectory and did not move like the white light did.  As I was watching this unfold the lights moved beyond my field of view blocked by my gara! ge.  As I started to back up very slowly, I started to also move to my left which exposed a huge portion of open sky that was previously blocked by my garage.  I then realized there were at least 3 other moving stars moving against a constellation of dimmer stars giving me the illusion that I was seeing 8 or more other moving stars.   I ran back into the house to get another person to witness this, but when I returned with the witness a few moments later all that was visible was the original moving star with the blinking red light beside it still traveling north.  The 3 or so moving objects were gone and just 4 or 5 dim stationary stars in a constellation remained. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Series of star-like lights traveling the same path and then disappearing;2020-03-29 21:00:00;1 minute;Series of star-like lights traveling the same path and then disappearing I saw what I initially thought was a satellite traveling through the sky - it was a light almost like a star.  It wasn't an airplane - it didn't have any flashing lights, there was no sound and it was much higher than an airplane.  As I watched it travel for about 20 seconds, it suddenly disappeared.  I then looked around and saw a series of exactly the same star like lights traveling in the exact same path from Northwest to Southeast.  There were approximately 5 of them, traveling in the same path, the same distance behind the next one and each of them disappeared as they reached the same location in the sky.  The entire process lasted approximately 1-2 minutes.  They must have been traveling extremely fast - much faster than an airplane would travel to cover as much distance as they were covering in that amount of time.;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001
