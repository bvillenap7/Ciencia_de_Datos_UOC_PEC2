Large slow moving craft with yellow lights over Hazel Dell Road.;2013-11-05 23:30:00;unknown;Large slow moving craft with yellow lights over Hazel Dell Road. My son (19 years old) was on his way home and saw a craft over Hazel Dell Road as he was heading north.  It was large and had multiple yellow lights that were flashing.  It made no sound and moved very slowly.  It had a triangle like shape with wings that extended down and a flat top.  The back was lined with yellow lights.  He drew a picture of what he saw the moment he arrived home.   He stopped in the road as there was no traffic and watched it for a minute or two.  As it moved out of his sight, traffic began to appear again.  He called me on his cell phone as soon as it was gone and told me about it.   He had left the house at 11:20 PM and now it was 11:53.  His trip should have taken no more than fifteen minutes.;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001
