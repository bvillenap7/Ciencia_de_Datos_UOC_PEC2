Orange Red UFO gliding over neighborhood;2013-07-05 00:00:00;3 minutes;Orange Red UFO gliding over neighborhood Just after midnight on the morning on July 5th, 2013, I was stargazing out my bedroom window and saw a UFO heading towards my direction from the east.  It was about 1000 yards away and slowly rising or gliding.  I looked for a craft but, the lights were very bright and I could not see beyond them.   The object had spherical lights that were bright, glowing soft orange and red in color that seemed to fluctuate.  It was pretty close as it appeared to be over another part of my neighborhood.   I grabbed my camcorder and ran outside and it was gone.  The orange color was incredibly beautiful, like a tangerine orange and very warm and soft at the same time.   I witnessed the event from inside so I cannot say if the UFO was silent.;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001
