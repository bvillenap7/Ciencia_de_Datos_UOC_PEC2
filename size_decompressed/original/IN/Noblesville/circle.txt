RD, 213 MY FRIEND SPOTTED a BRIGHT SHINNING METALIC CIRCULAR OBJECT ,SHE ASKED IF I HAD SEEN IT . I SAID NO THEN A FEW SECONDS LATER WE BOTH SAW IT SEVERAL MORE TIMES ,IT WAS IF YOU COULD ONLY SEE IT WHEN IT WAS TURNING. THERE WAS OTHER AIR CRAFT WE COULD SEE FLYING AROUND, NONE OF WITCH WERE APPEARING AND DISAPPEARING.THEN WE LEFT THE HIGH POINT WHERE WE COULD VIEW MILES OF SKY THEN WE NEVER SAW IT AGAIN. IT WAS FAIRLY SMALL, LIKE MAYBE THE SIZE OF A PERSONAL AIRCRAFT. SHINNEY SILVER METALIC CIRCULAR ,DIDN'T REALLY FIT ANY DESCRIPTION I HAVE EVER READ OR HEARD ABOUT. bUT IT WAS A VERY BRIGHT SUNNY DAY VERY CLEAR NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY LIKE SAID WE COULD SEE SOME PLANES COMMING IN AND GOING OUT OF THE FISHERS AIRPORT ,APROXIMATLY 10 MILES AWAY, WHAT WE SAW WAS MUCH CLOSER THAN THAT . WE COULD ALSO SEE SEVERAL OTHER PLANES WITHIN A TEN MILE RANGE, I NOTICED. WHAT WE SAW DISAPPEARED BEFORE OUR EYES;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001
Yellow-White Flat Round Light travels west to east then another travels east to west all in 15 seconds;2004-09-27 21:55:00;5-seconds;Yellow-White Flat Round Light travels west to east then another travels east to west all in 15 seconds Walking out to my van this evening and looking up and saw what I thought was a shooting star that traveled West to East at about 75-degrees relative to myself. It was Yellow-White and looked flat round but lacking any trailing light. The light traveled about 1-2 seconds and taveled about 20-degrees from start of 75 to 50 to 55-degrees. Oddly it came and went out of and into sight without changing size or shape.  Then aprox. 10 seconds later the same event happened in exactly in reverse.  Same portion of sky and all details?;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001

Golden orange sphere not blinking, flying close to air traffic, and changing directionâ€¦;2014-02-26 20:05:00;10 minutes;Golden Orange sphere not blinking, flying close to air traffic, and changing direction.... I observed an object in the nw sky, moving toward the south, I then observed a plane coming from the south, I say a plane, because I saw the flashing lights. the object I saw was bright and golden/Orange, with no flashing.   I usually see this when I believe it to be a satellite.. but when I saw it and the plane so close together, and then the non  blinking object move south east when they were in what looked like close proximity, I knew it was not a satellite.  A satellite would not change direction like this object did.   Also, it was a little brighter than the, satellites I see in the sky, and I've never observed one of those change directions as I did this object...  I was driving at the time, pulled over, but was not able to capture a picture our video.   I just know, it was different from what normally observe with satellites.;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001
