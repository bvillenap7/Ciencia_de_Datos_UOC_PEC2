Silent crafts flying over Noblesville;2012-06-14 22:50:00;15 min;Silent crafts flying over Noblesville This is the second time that I have noticed silent aircraft flying over my house in north Noblesville Indiana.   The craft have normal aerial warning lights so I assume they are military.  I do not know the altitude that they are flying at, but they seem to be at a medium height and make no sound I can detect even after they pass overhead.  I used to live in northern metro Detroit where there was lots of air traffic and I always heard jets overhead, we also still hear jets overhead sometimes but this recent night the one aircraft that flew over that was silent was followed by another craft that I could not make out the shape of, but the second craft blinked a super bright white light.  It was kind of strange, I am sure these are some type of military craft.;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001
