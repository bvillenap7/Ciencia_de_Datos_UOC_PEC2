Bright fireball spotted over Noblesville Indiana;2007-06-29 23:40:00;approx 3 min;Bright fireball spotted over Noblesville Indiana Appeared to be a fireball. First thought to be some sort of firework resembling a flare on a parachute. Object ascended just southeast of our subdivision and headed west appearing to accelerate and gain altitude until it disappeared into the light cloud cover in the western sky. This object was clearly self propelled and silent. We are interested in talking to anyone else who may have viewed this object.;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001
Orange Flashing Light Over Indianapolis.;2008-07-15 05:55:00;1-2 minutes;Orange Flashing Light Over Indianapolis Just about dawn I noticed a two white lights to the South above the tree line toward Indianapolis.  One was moving from East to West and appeared to be an aircraft with navigational lights flashing.  Has it go closed to the second stationary light, the stationary light flashed orange for a second and the first light changed direction back to the East.  The second light flashed about four more times over the next minute in the same position.  I lost sight of it and then I saw it flash orange once more time behind the tree line to the East.;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001
Unknown light in sky headed toward Tipton;2010-06-01 19:15:00;7 minutes;Unknow light in sky headed toward Tipton Last night around 7:15pm my wife came inside from the car and took me outside there had been several people driving in the street that stoped and the neighbors next door were also outside looking up at what appeared to be some type of a fireball that was moving at a good rate of speed.   Speaking with the neighbors they also said it looked like a lantern in the sky but it was not on a slant toward the earth but instead flying.   We have no idea what it is and have never seen anything like it;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001
