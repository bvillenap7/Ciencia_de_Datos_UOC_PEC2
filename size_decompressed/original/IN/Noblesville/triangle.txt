black triangle over Tesla concert  in Noblesville,IN 1992;1992-09-01 22:00:00;3-5minutes;black triangle over Tesla concert  in Noblesville,IN 1992 I was at the Deer Creek ampitheatre watching a concert for the rock band Tesla and I was lying down in the lawn looking up at the stars.  As I was looking up when a large black triange-shaped craft with a yellow/white lights at each of the corners with a red pulsating light in the center of the craft.  It was flying very low, slower than most small airplanes in a northeast to southwest direction in the general path I-69 follows into Indianapolis.  As the craft flew towards Indy, I could see its silhoutte against the city lights and I saw a small red orb-like light fly up to the craft then a short time later fly back towards the ground.  At the time I didn't think too much about what I saw, but I seen the same craft that was seen in Belgium, Illinois, etc., and when I realized that others have seen this craft I knew I wasn't imagining this thing.  In my opinion, if this craft is one of ours then I believe it's some sort of low and slow stealth reconnaise craft.  This football field sized craft obviously wasn't concerned with being seen since there was probably 10,000-15,000 people at the show.  But during a loud, bright rock concert not too many people are paying attention to the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001
V shaped objects seen in the night sky over central Indiana, USA;2008-04-16 22:10:00;3 minutes;V shaped objects seen in the night sky over central Indiana, USA First I want to say this was no meteor shower. My wife and I live between Noblesville and Lapel, we have left the house to go to work at 10:00 pm. as we pulled out of our driveway onto 186th street we notice what to be an object with several different color lights to the North West. Within 30 seconds we saw what appeared to be five to seven yellowish lights appear to the left of the first object in a V shape and shortly there after another group of yellowish lights appeared just below with the same V shape. We stopped the car and rolled down the windows we heard nothing, no sound at all. These lights we stationary and not moving, we watched for about 2 to 3 minutes then noticed the first object disappear and shortly there after the two V shapes were gone, just disappeared. There was no sound and no other type of flashes that would be associated with an explosion. We did not see any trailing streaks as has been reported by others. A short while later my wife did say that she had seen a falling star with a trailing light behind it. We don't know what it was that we saw, but we do know that it was not a jet liner as our house sits in the flight path of Indianapolis International Airport in which we see jets preparing to land every night. This is really strange and we agree that we will never know what we saw Wednesday night for sure. The Military and government has a long history of covering up the real truth, thinking Americans cannot handle the truth thus causing panic among the population.;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001
