Red blur in the night sky changed speed, luminosity, and then accelerated when I went outside;2002-06-01 21:00:00;2 minutes;Red blur in the night sky changed speed, luminosity, and then accelerated when I went outside This occured early one night a couple of years ago.  In the northwestern sky, I would guess about 60-75 degrees above the horizon, I saw a deep red blur up in the sky through my kitchen window, probably about the size of a thumb when held at arms length.  Curious, I kept my eye on it for several moments to watch its slow southern to southwestern progress.  Finally I went out the back door to get a better look.  When I did, the center of the blur grew in intensity, as if it had been a light shining through clouds but the clouds had now broken apart. At this same moment several other points began to glow brightly within the haze.  Immediately these lights and the glow surrounding them took off in the same direction that the object had been slowly drifting.  It did not take off incredibly fast, but its movement was far more rapid than any plane would seem to have from that distance, and its acceleration from the slow drift was instantaneous.  Its movement was also level with the earth the entire time I witnessed it, causing me to beleive it was not a falling celestial body. I have never told anyone except my friends and family, or ever reported this sort of thing. But after doing some research and listening to other witnesses, I thought this encounter definitely merited some attention. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

Silvery disc, far away, moving south;2004-04-23 20:30:00;1 min;Silvery disc, far away, moving south I was letting my dog out (so many of these reports start like this...) I was looking at the sky and I saw the crescent moon, the north star bright and below and to the right (North) and then far to the left (South) was a bright blue star and then below and to the right of the blue star I saw a silvery dot. It moved from right to left but it kept dissappearing. I swear for almost a split second it looked like the classic ufo (disc with half a circle on top in middle) but it was really far away...Oh, also it was being chased by either a helicopter or plane (light flashing) but the disc did not emit any light;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001
((HOAX??))  5 stationary objects-5-7 moving.;2008-07-11 22:30:00;2 hours;5 stationary objects-5-7 moving I consider myself a level headed individual and am a business owner and a student.  At approximately 10:30 last night (7-11-08) I had witnessed something that has really disturbed me. There were five objects that were stationary in the sky in somewhat of a hexagonal pattern that possessed flashing lights that were not of the same frequency as regular planes. I had grabbed my binoculars to take a better look, considering they were at a distance, and discovered they were in rotation around the objects. After observing these objects and noticing other aircraft circling them (airplanes-not airliners) for approximately an hour, five to seven disc shaped objects flew directly overhead and disappeared to the north. The way these objects were maneuvering I had never seen before and they moved so fast as compared to the planes that it was entirely obvious they werenâ€™t the norm. If nothing else I am hoping that someone else had witnessed the same thing considering I am in somewhat of a populated area and it was a Friday night. I know what I saw-an answer or a corresponding account would be great. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above, to reflect 10:30 p.m. on July 11.  Probable hoax, we suspect.
