translucent craft changing shape and silent;1998-10-09 16:00:00;35 secs;translucent craft changing shape and silent My son and myself were at a local high school football game, approx mid october 1998.  It was partly cloudy and a cool night, there was some smoke from a barbeque coming over the stadium.  We were sitting mid-field when a silent object moving approx. 40-50 mph went overhead.  I sighted the object at the 30 yard line and followed it about have a mile past the stadium.  The strange thing is it appeared to be triangular yet not. It seemed to rotate and change shape and appeared to be approx 60 feet wide and 200 feet off the ground.  Its as though you could see right through it, but it still had a discernable shape. My son who was 11 at the time, looked over at me and said dad did you see that?.  I told him I did. I then asked my brother-in-law if he had seen anything. He hadn't.  Its like we were the only 2 people in the stadium to witness this event.;40.0583124999999;-86.0292125000001
