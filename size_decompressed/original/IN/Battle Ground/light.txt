My husband and I were out for our evening walk last Friday night.  It had just gotten fully dark.  We live in a small town with rural area beyond.  I noticed 4-5 bright orange/gold lights hovering on the horizon.  They looked like roman candles ready to go out.  I said look to my husband and he saw them too.  Then they instantly disappeared.;40.528;-86.8298
