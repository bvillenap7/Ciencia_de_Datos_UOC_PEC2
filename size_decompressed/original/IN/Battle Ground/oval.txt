Large object flying in the sky;2002-08-13 22:30:00;10 seconds;Large object flying in the sky I was driving down the road at night and slowing down to prepare for a sharp turn. As I was driving I noticed a bright star-like figure in the sky far away. So I slowed and pointed the object out to my sister. Turning the corner I noticed that the light had dissappeared, so I stopped. As I stopped I looked up over some trees a little distance away and notice a very large ovil shape object with four bright yellowish lights in the sky. It took a second for me to realize that it was a foriegn object, but once I had I noticed that it moved very slow across the horizon of the trees. At that point I drove quickly away to the safety of my home.;40.528;-86.8298
