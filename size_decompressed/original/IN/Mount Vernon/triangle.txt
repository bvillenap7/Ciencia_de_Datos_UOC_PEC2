Two warehouse men at Mt. Vernon Milling Co. saw an object.  I went to check my hopper cars.  Climbing up onto the car I happened to look back.  I stood on top and watched the object until it disappeared.  In 15 seconds it was gone.  It was about six blocks away, 60-80 feet in the air.  The object was orange and wedge shaped.;37.9467;-87.8577999999999
UFO sited from highway.;2005-03-01 20:30:00;uncertain;UFO sited from highway. The object was bright, very bright, bright enough to be mistaken for a very bright star at a distance. It moved very slowly, but was moving at a rate visible to the naked eye when we passed under it. As we passed under it, I tried to get a glimpse of it's shape and deducted it to be a solid form, either circular or triangular, maybe cubical. The friend sitting in the passenger seat leaned his head out the window and said he thought it looked like a triangle. There was a single light at the side moving forward, rather large and seeming to take the entire corner of the object. Roughly 1 and a half minutes later, after leaving the highway then returning to it, the object had easily moved another 4 miles - much farther than the pace it had been going should have allowed. It was continuing to move south when I again left the highway, a change from the western course it had been taking. The object was clearly not a plane or helicopter, nor any other flying craft I've ever seen for myself. My counterpart sitting in the passenger seat agreed, and also accepts that what we saw was likely some sort of UFO.;37.9467;-87.8577999999999
The object appeared to have 3 reddish/reddish-orange lights in a triangular pattern.  ((NUFORC Note:  MUFON case.  PD));2014-07-04 21:30:00;5 minutes;The object appeared to have 3 reddish/reddish-orange lights in a triangular pattern. The lady and her husband went outside approximately between 9:15 and 9:20 to set off a few fireworks and watch neighborhood fireworks.  At approximately 9:30 they noticed an object traveling from the east to the west then southwest.  The object appeared to have 3 reddish/reddish orange lights in a triangular pattern.  It made no sound. They observed it for approximately 5 minutes.  It seemed to be really high but really big and followed a straight line and did not waiver.  Her husband estimated that when it suddenly disappeared it must have been over Illinois or maybe even Missouri.  The object did not disappear behind trees, it disappeared from the sky like turning out a light.  Several planes flew over in the next 15-20 minutes going different directions and altitudes.  All observed to have blinking lights and you could hear the engine on these planes.  (MUFON 57635);37.9467;-87.8577999999999
