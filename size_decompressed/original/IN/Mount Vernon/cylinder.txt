Cigar-shaped body of lights with sound like ariver  barge.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by MUFON member/SSD.  PD));1973-10-18 22:30:00;5 minutes;Cigar-shaped body of lights with sound like ariver  barge. The Lady had gone to bed but was disturbed by a noise, described as sounding like a barge on the river.  She decided to go outside and check it out.  She saw an object over her garage and to the south, merely an outline produced by as many as 50 lights, not exactly evenly-spaced.  It didn't appear to have any body, and it had a red flashing light on the rear, long and narrow, about 3 times as long as it was wide, moving real slow East to West.  She observed the long side view about 3 minutes, and right in front of her house it turned south toward the river and she saw the end view, described as like a squared-off cigar.  At this time it was really low and she said she should have seen metal as it went past a tree.  5 minutes.  MUFON SSD).;37.9467;-87.8577999999999
