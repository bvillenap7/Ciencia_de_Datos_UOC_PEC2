Police put the squad car spotlight on it again and it immediately moved away and out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  F. Ridge report.  PD));1973-11-02 22:37:00;Several minutes;Police put the squad car spotlight on it again and it immediately moved away and out of sight. Police Chief Wilfred Clerk and Officer John Tucker were on a pursuit of a drunken driver in Point Township. The driver had gone off the road and into a ditch. Waiting for a wrecker, the officers observed an object in the southwest that approached them, then stopped. It was a strange-looking object which we now refer to as an OBOL (Orange Ball Of Light) and their spotlight placed on it caused the light to get brighter and closer. After about a minute and a half, they put the squad car spotlight on it again and it immediately moved away and out of sight.

Bright Light seemed to draw nearer;2002-09-05 20:00:00;2 hrs;Bright Light seemed to draw nearer a bright light appeared in the sky, and at first it was distant. but every time I went outside it seemed to get a little closer, until the third or fourth time, it had went down below the trees so we couldnt see it anymore.. then my son went outside, and the sky was filled with jets, 15 he said he counted.. and they were circleing as if they were looking for something.  This abject appeared in the sky two nights in a row.   It was the second night that the jets appeared.  I am still waiting to see if it appears again tonight.  Since then strange things have been happening..  like disappearing headlights, that seemed to be of cars, but now Im not sure.   We live out in the country, and in the middle of nowhere, so the skies are clear and the stars are bright. but   This WAS NOT a star.. I do have pics ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We believe that a celestial body would have to be ruled out, first.   PD));37.9467;-87.8577999999999
