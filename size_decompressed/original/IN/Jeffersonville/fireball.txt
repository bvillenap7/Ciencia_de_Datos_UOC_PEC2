It was moving at an increadible speed and at a high altitude. The object we observed on November 16, 1999, at 19:04, was that of a huge fireball-shaped object traveling east, northeast at an amazing rate of travel.  Only 1 (one) object was observed at the date and time noted above.  It was golden in color with bright green and orange showing up at one point during the observation. I have seen a similar object like the one described above in the late winter of 1995 while standing at a bus stop.  However, the second observer, my mother, has most likely observed a UFO in the late fall of 1978 along with my sister.  Their observation of the craft they seen that night sounds increadible.;38.3077646881286;-85.7358959758548
