A jet fighter would approach and the saucer would instantly disappear and re-appear about one half mile north.  This happen several times in a few minutes with probably twenty people gathering, and then suddenly everything was back to normal and everyone left.  Nothing was reported or read about this happening.  I called the local WCHS news station and they had not heard sbout it and were not interested in the story.

Bright, flashing object see overhead in Jeffersonville.;2008-10-31 02:00:00;1 hour;Bright, flashing object see overhead in Jeffersonville. The flashing object hovered in the sky and changed colors multi time.  It was between 2:00am - 3:00am.  It was the only object that was flashing in the sky.  All other stars were very dim. When it moved it appeared to move up.  We had never seen anything like this before.  We did view with the binoculars and really got to see the different colors and shapes.  We were unable to capture a picture. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides little contact information.  PD));38.3077646881286;-85.7358959758548
