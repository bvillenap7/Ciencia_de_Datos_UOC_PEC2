5 decent sized UFOs rotating shining bright.;2012-12-04 23:50:00;14 minutes;5 decent sized UFOs rotating shining bright Me and a buddy of mine walked outside looking towards the Louisville skyline from Jeffersonville, IN, when we noticed something strange in the sky.  The aircraft looked to be a huge star at first until I noticed it was rotating counterclockwise with 5 different lights shining bright.   As the UFO starts to move more towards Louisville another aircraft appeared from a distance.  The 2 UFO began to go up and down and side tot side in a very smooth motion.  There were other aircraft flying overhead of this arriving and departing from Louisville International Airport.   I lost sight of the UFOs at 11:57pm after they had crossed the Ohio River to only show them selfs 4mins later with 3more &quotUFOs&quot before speeding away.  I checked Louisville International Airport's flight reports which showed a UPS plane had problems and had to do an emergency landing from ...the smell of fumes on the aircraft.;38.3077646881286;-85.7358959758548
10-12 bright orange spherical balls of light, some turning away from others, and one coming in close;2013-11-19 19:00:00;7-8 minutes;10-12 bright orange spherical balls of light, some turning away from others, and one coming in close On November 19th, I was filming sunset with my HTC-one cell phone.  After seeing strange, odd crafts flying during sunset I stayed and continued filming after it got dark.   I first seen around 4 bright orange/red orbs, perfectly spherical and, not flickering or flashing like lanterns.  They were flying from north east to west.  I watched as one of them made a slow right turn away from others and all vanished soon after.   I did not have my cell on during the first set, the cell battery was dying and I had to use cigarette lighter to charge.  But then two more came in from same direction, flying next to each other.   One of them made the same slow right turn away from me before disappearing.  The other stayed straight, then also disappeared.  Moments later I watched one fly in by itself.  Then another by itself, but this one was much closer than the others.  It came in just as fast as others, but slowed down while in flight.  There were a few more that came by, whole event lasted around 7-8minutes.   This was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen, I'm glad I had my new cellphone to share this experience.  I am not happy how it came out, the video is great with amazing close-up.  But the camera while filming at night has a hard time focusing on light sources.  It looks like they are flickering or flashing but they were not.  They were steadily lit, they changed in Color slightly from red to orange to yellow.  But they were NOT flashing.  In my video I use another video to show examples of light sources at night while filming with cell, and you can see how street lights and other lights look through camera.   I have had many experiences since June of this year 2013, all of these experiences have taken place in close proximity to some very very large power lines that run across the Ohio river and through city.   This is just my theory, but I believe it has something to do with these power lines.  Maybe they steal or somehow harne! ss energy from lines.   I will be following up on this and have! found a PowerStation in close distance to where these orange orbs originated from.  But the weird part about this whole thing is minutes after filming these orange orbs, a large Blackhawk type helicopter was seen flying lower and faster than I have ever seen.   I am 32years old and have lived here my entire life, I have seen black helicopters before, but never this low and never this fast.  It was flying exactly straight towards where these orange orbs were seen flying from or where they possibly originated from.;38.3077646881286;-85.7358959758548
Recorded orange sphere split into 2 and slowly move to the right.;2019-10-16 20:00:00;5 minutes;Recorded orange sphere split into 2 and slowly move to the right. Me and my mother walked out to smoke. She told me to look up asking what something was. There was a bright orange light.  I ran in and grabbed my phone to record.  As soon as i got back out the orange sphere split into 2.  The slowley started moving toward the right. I got some of it recorded.  The video shows the 2 spheres start to blink an move slowley and it pulsates and makes the camera on my phone blur an clears up and then they dissapear.  I still have the recording.;38.3077646881286;-85.7358959758548
