Triangular dark shape hovering above closed ammunition plant in Southern Indiana.;1990-07-01 22:00:00;ten minutes;Triangular dark shape hovering above closed ammunition plant in Southern Indiana. My mother and I were driving back home from Clarksville, Indiana. It was dark outside and the weather was warm and clear. We were driving northeast along the road that takes you past the Jeffersonville Ammunitions Plant. We both saw it at the same time. An object in the sky with no lights. It didn't appear to be moving. The object was hovering above one of the old closed down factory sections. It wasn't really high but it wasn't what I would call low either. I would saw that it was as high as a very tall radio tower(if that makes any sense). If I had to guess how big it was, I would have to compare it to jets I have seen at airshows at that altitude. I would say about the size of a B1-B. We approached it. It was off to the east of us. It never moved from the point in that point in the sky. My mother slowed down and I stuck my head out the window for about three minutes. I never heard any noise coming from the object and there were only a couple of cars in the area but not near us. The object was dark. Not reflective that I saw. It was triangular in shape. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.3077646881286;-85.7358959758548

Triangular shaped object with no sound and solid lights spotted over Jeffersonville, IN.;2015-07-17 22:15:00;5 minutes;Triangular shaped object with no sound and solid lights spotted over Jeffersonville, IN. On July 17, 2015 at approximately 10:15pm eastern standard time in Jeffersonville, IN.  There was an object approaching our home from the southern direction with one solid light in the front.  From a distance you could see a rounded top that appeared to be a helicopter.  However, as it got closer it was hovering above and within 100 yards of the ground.  There was absolutely no sound and it remained extremely steady during 50-60 mph winds with absolutely no movement.   It was during this time that the power to the house began to go on and off four times, not flickering,but distinctly turning off then back on.  It then turned 1/4 of a circle and proceeded forward to the west almost gliding like.  It was at that point you could make out two more visible lights on each back corner indicating the object was a triangular shape.  Directly in the middle of the back side was a large circle (red orange in color) that looked like a jet engine that just glowed, but again there! was no sound.;38.3077646881286;-85.7358959758548
