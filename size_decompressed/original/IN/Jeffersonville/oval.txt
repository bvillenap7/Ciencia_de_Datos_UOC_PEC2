Two UFO sighting in Two weeks in the summer of 1983, Louisville, KY.;1983-06-02 22:00:00;10 minutes;Two UFO sighting in Two weeks in the summer of 1983, Louisville, KY In June of 1983 my cousin and I (age 10 and 13) had just enjoyed the festivities of Steamboat Days and had a generous curfew of 10 pm.   As we made our way to my aunt's house my cousin and I stopped at the old railroad bridge that had LRS102 radio station's lights on it as it still does today but not working when my cousin said what's that?  I asked him what he was talking about and he pointed to an object that was directly over the Louisville, KY, skyline, he proclaimed its a UFO.  I laughed and said it's an airplane and we watched it as it approached our location on the Jeffersonville  river bank and it soon was clear that it was'nt an airplane at all. I became frightened and my cousin just yelled out beam me up scotty in which I replied to him to shut up. The object was oval shaped with multi colored lights making two rotaions two the left then two rotations to the right, it was completely silent and became more freightened then the craft came down and hovered about 20 ft above the bridge silently with no disturbance to the water below. We watched in awe and fear as it just hovered for maybe two or three minutes then it slowly acended and once it reached an altitude of about 3000ft it zoomed off into the nite sky and left us paniced and we went home excitedly telling my aunt the story who obviously didnt believe us at all. The next day I went home to louisville where I told my older  brother what happened of course he laughed at me and ridiculed me, well later that day we had been watching television when a commercial for the local news came on, the reported Jim Mitchell of WHAS 11 said tonite at 11 a Clarksville, IN man has video of a UFO, my brother looked at me with eyes and mouth agape and I proclaimed I told you so now do you believe me?  We asked my dad if we could please stay up to watch the news that it was important my dad thought it was odd that we would care about the news program but ok but your going to bed rite after, so my brother and I waited nervously all evening long until the news came on, we watched the whole program and it never mentioned it once. Two weeks later at around 830 pm, my dad said we need to go to Kmart to get your little brother some diapers before they close so it was my dad, step mom and two siblings in the front and I sat in the bed of the truck wearing shorts and flip flops and no shirt, my dad who was an alcoholic was drunk and drinking and driving along popular level road blasting three dog nite on the 8 track, about two blocks from the Kmart we stopped a redlight on popular level where I could see the Kmart sign all lit up. I noticed something strange, there was a warm breeze raining (down) on me and I looked at my arms and the hair was standing up on them and my neck so I looked up and there was a massive craft like the one i'd seen two weeks earlier but much larger like a mother ship and I could see intricate piping mostly squared in shape and I nearly broke my neck looking from one end to another it was as large as a football field and I began to feel sick to my stomach. I began beating on the sliding glass window of the pickup truck yelling: dad, dad but got no response he was to drunk and the horrible 70's music had drowned out my screams and I looked up again and it was gone, now surely there was multiple people that saw this thing I mean we were not alone at the stoplight and im sure someone saw me looking upwards;38.3077646881286;-85.7358959758548
