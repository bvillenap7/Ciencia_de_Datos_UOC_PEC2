Intense blue light filling room, and a baby nine months later;2004-12-30 02:30:00;5 Minutes;Intense blue light filling room, and a baby nine months later 	I was asleep in my bed, so I do not know the exact time of the incident. At the time I was living with my parents, so my bedroom window was facing South. It was about 2:30, or so, in the morning. I was suddenly awaken by nothing in particular. What I mean is there was no sound, no light, no nothing that would have woken me up. It was only the overwhelming feeling of urgency. When I awoke nothing seemed out of the ordinary, although my gaze was immediately drawn toward the window. 	The moon seemed very far away, further than normal, but very bright. As I stared at it, it seemed to move closer and closer. It turned into nothing but light, no longer a shape. The light filled my room, illuminating it with a light blue light. However, this light was unlike anything I had ever seen. It was very intense. I turned away and noticed everything in my room was also lit up. Then as soon as it happened, it was gone. 	The light was drawn away the same as it came, ending with just the full moon seeming very far away. It was as if it was trying to trick me. The next morning I thought that it had all been a dream, but when I looked around, all of my things were in the same place as when the initial incident happened.  This was all the proof that I needed. However, this was not all that I got. 	Nine months later I had my first daughter. I did have a boyfriend at the time, however we were not active. I was not aware that I was pregnant until I went in on the night of her birth. I only gained 15 pounds and had no signs or symptoms. I even had my menstrual cycle every month. She was born on October 4th. She was and still is extremely healthy. She is also very smart and a bit larger than most children her age. However, besides that she is pretty normal.;41.5654;-87.2595
