He was in the army 11yrs.  I looked east. saw what at first I thought was the street light. But it was to high and to big. told my husband to look. Just as he did the light shot over to the woods and stopped in the trees. It stayed there maybe 10 seconds then it was gone. My husband said the helicoptor went north at a high rate of speed. We discussed it for many minutes. We have discussed it many times. We saw the same thing.;41.5654;-87.2595
