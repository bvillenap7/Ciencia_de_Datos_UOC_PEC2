Lights in the sky;2004-04-09 21:00:00;1min.;Lights in the sky Last friday night around 9:00 p.m. I was sitting on my front porch when I noticed a light out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look and noticed six lights in a circle hovering in the sky. The lights were on for about 10 to 15 seconds then went off. In about 30 more seconds they came back on again about 200 yards to the north and stayed on for about 10 to 15 seconds before they went back off. That was the last I saw of them.  All I could see were the lights. Friday was a very hazy night in Monticello.;40.761;-86.7557
