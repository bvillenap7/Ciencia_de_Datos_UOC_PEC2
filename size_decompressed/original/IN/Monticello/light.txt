Reappears 10-15 seconds in another location.  3 jets scramble the area. While sitting in a hot tub only minutes after we entered. My wife saw a light and asked if it was a star in the east at about the tree line. It was almost the same size and distance to resemble a star. But as we looked, it slowly faded. I replied, well I don't think stars disappear. So we kept watching. Every 15-30 seconds it would appear in a different location but at the same level of horizon but many miles apart. This happened about 10-11 times. While this was happening there were 3 jets that would alternate flying west to east and circle back. As the jet got closer the light would reappear then fade. At one time as the jet appeared a smaller light left the light object as if a missle tracking a target. This light either circled the jet or just faded as it got closer to the jet. I commented to my wife that I was expecting an explosion as I felt it was just like the Patriot missle that would track and explode the Scud missle. As soon as this streamer light (which did leave a visible path trail) faded. 2 lights the same size reappeared and one was just above the other. They lit up for 3-5 seconds and then faded. All this time the jets circled or criss crossed. After 8:15 the objects did not reappear( at least in the East) but I did see jets circling in the north only minutes later. Also about an hour later the satelite dish which is Dish network was split screen for about 10 minutes. This may just be coincidental. I am very interested if anyone may have seen the same thing. I am searching the web now and will watch the news tonight. (This is a correction of the date from my previous report. I had listed Jan 26 in error in fact it was Jan 27.)

Three fireballs repeated approx. every 30 sec. apart just south of Monticello;2004-10-07 20:30:00;5-7 min;Three fireballs repeated approx. every 30 sec. apart just south of Monticello I was driving on Springboro Rd. driving north toward Monticello from Ind. 18 at about 8:30 P.M. when I noticed three fireballs to the northeast of my location. They appeared in quickly one after another, about a half second between each, in an area approx a moon's width apart. The fireballs were a bright orange color, similar to a road flare, and lasted about five seconds, with the first one to appear being the first one to go out and so on. I continued to watch the area of sky where the lights appeared and continued to see the same three fireball cycle continue for the next 5 to 7 minutes,with the cycle repeating, about every thirty seconds, until I was directly west of the fireballs. I guessed, based on a cell phone tower that the fireballs were in front of, that the fireballs were located approx. 3 to 4 miles southeast of Monticello at a height of 2,000 to 4,000 ft. There were aircraft in the area that I feel were military but these aircraft were all to the west of my location and were doing some kind of training activities with each other, which is a common thing to see at that time on Thursday nights. This is not the first time I have seen the fireballs, but it is the first time I have been certain it was not a naturally occuring fireball.;40.761;-86.7557

We seen 3 bright orange lights separate from each other. The farthest right light flashed then the middle and the third. after that it just sat there for about 3 seconds then it went away. My friend said it was in the sky on the right then jumped to the left and thats when in flickered. about 5 minutes after the UFO left we seen a big ball of white light go down towards the earth, kinda like a meteor but it was to big for that. all this was seen at night.;40.761;-86.7557

We stopped and observed objects till a car approached from the north.   I drove down and turned around and went back at which time all objects had vanished.;40.761;-86.7557
Walking home from seeing a movie, I noticed an object moving around in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Jupiter??  PD));2017-04-14 22:30:00;~1 hour;Walking home from seeing a movie, I noticed an object moving around in the sky.   I stopped and looked at it, and noticed it was flying in circles and zig zags, the light got brighter and dimmer over time and when I saw it the clearest I noticed it had 3 lights in a triangle formation.  When the three lights were observable, dogs in the neighborhood began barking.   I observed this object for about an hour before it just vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Jupiter??
