Eight light objects appeared in a perfectly straight line, 45 degrees off the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-12-22 19:45:00;15 minutes;Eight light objects appeared in a perfectly straight line, 45 degrees off the horizon We saw a perfectly straight line of 8 bright lights in a 45 degree angle off the ground. Each of the crafts was perfectly spaced from the next. After watching and acknowledging it (verbally) they began to separate, again at perfectly even interval distances. The one highest up then shot off and, in order, they sequentially shot off and disappeared. We thought maybe they were planes, but they hovered in place perfectly for way too long to be a plane and were very bright (we initially thought they were stars). They also moved much too quickly to be any known man-powered craft. We also used a constellation app on the phone to try to determine if it was a constellation, but the app was unable to detect any major stars or planets where the anomaly appeared in the sky. This may or may not be associated, but a flock of geese began honking erratically and several dogs started barking at the same time we noticed these anomalies.;40.761;-86.7557
