Dog alerting me something was not right;2011-11-30 20:30:00;not sure;Dog alerting me something was not right Both my pets acted very unusual.....nervous, anxious.  I have a cat and a dog.  I had to continually let my dog out and I noticed 3 lights in a straight line that looked like stars at first glance but then I noticed that they were different in color and clarity.  More of a blue/white rather than yellow/white and didn't look like the other stars around.  I had never noticed this group of stars before.  I saw them at around 20:30.  I brought my dog in but he refused to settle down and go to bed.  He was very insistant to me that something was not right.  I let him out again around 22:00 and that star formation was completely gone.  All of the other stars that were in the vacinity were there but not those  3. My pets acted strange all night.  2 of my other friends with pets told me this morn that their pets acted strange also.
