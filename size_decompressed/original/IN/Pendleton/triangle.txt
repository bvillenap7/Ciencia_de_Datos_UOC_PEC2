There were 2 main ones but a third appeared in the video and photos and we did not see it with the naked eye.;2012-03-10 21:54:00;45 Mins;There were 2 main ones but a third appeared in the video and photos and we did not see it with the naked eye. We were on the back deck and thought there were 2 planets that were visible due to the brightness and the largeness of the two objects.  Suddenly they started getting brighter and moving aka hovering closer, after being awestruck for about ten minutes, we got out telescope but, were unable to see them in the telescope for some reason, when they started moving on, me and another friend got into the car and followed them for about 9 miles, we then pulled over because they seemed to be getting further away, when we got out of the car, they seemed to hover backwards and got close enough for us to take photos and videos, and in an instant they were gone. Our video is approximately 3.15 minutes long.;39.9955;-85.7518
Large and small aircraft between 10pm and 3 am.  ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports from this area, that we are aware of.  PD));2012-08-17 22:00:00;for hours;Large and small aircraft between 10pm and 3 am If you live in Pendleton, watch the skies  at night after 10pm you will see most nights between 10-12 large triangular shaped aircrafts and around them will be alot of smaller red and orange lighted small small objects and NEVER will you see a large one with out the smaller ones, this has been occuring for months now, at first we all thought they were test drones until they started forming shapes like triangles, circles and kind of like dancing across the sky. It blows my mind that there aren't more people from Pendleton on here cause this is a constant occurance, the big ones are HUGE! My daughter was home in July from the Army and saw them and freaked she thought it was an alien invasion because there were so many, but after 3 am they just go away. I called the FAA in Nashville which is the location that is in charge of Indiana flight paths, they said nothing but normal commercial flights are in the sky, well, these are NOT commercial flights!  They apparently do not show up on radar, but, he said they had a large number of calls from Indiana lately.  It is either Drones being silly or I am insane and it is a true UFO.  If you live in the Pendleton area please watch at night and post on here so we can compare info.  Thank you! ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports from this area, that we are aware of.
