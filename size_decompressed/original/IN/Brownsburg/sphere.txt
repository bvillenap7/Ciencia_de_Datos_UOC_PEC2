Gentlemen: I was on my way home from work one morning.  The object In question looked like a full moon that was out that previous night as well... but this object was hovering when first I spotted it... I say hovering we'll suffice it too say it was stationary,  Then all of a sudden it started moving toward the north by north west...  As we all know the moon does not travel on a north west trajectory...  Especially over here on the north American continent.  The last time that I saw it it went over a hill and I lost sight of it..  As I was on the interstate at the time I couldn't pursue it any further.  If you have any further questions of me on this matter just contact me by the usual methods.   After I got home and was unloading the car I happened to look to the south and there was the moon right where it was supposed to be...
