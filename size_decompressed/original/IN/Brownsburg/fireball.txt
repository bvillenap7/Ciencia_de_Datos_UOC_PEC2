fireball over brownsburg indiana;2009-07-06 06:00:00;2 minutes;fireball over brownsburg indiana At about 6 am, my husband was leaving for work, when he saw a fireball in the sky. He quickly ran and grabbed the camara, and taped about a minute of video of what looked like a flame, or ball of fire, floating in the sky. There was no sound accompanying it. My husband is a very skeptical, CPA, who doesn't believe in anything he can not see, so for him to watch this, much less video the incident, is a huge sign that is was something very strange. He had to leave to get to work on time, but as he drove he kept looking for it. After floating along slowly, suddenly it was gone. It was definately nothing we have ever seen before, and doesn't appear to be man-made.;39.8487;-86.3782000000001
Orange Orbs South East of Brownsbrug, IN;2012-10-06 20:42:00;3 minutes;Orange Orbs South East of Brownsbrug, IN On 10/6/2012. My wife and I were waiting to park in our garage.  One of our kids had parked blocking our entrance.   As we waited our car faced South-East so that we could pull in as soon as the other car was moved. During the time we waited, we noticed two orange orbs in the night sky facing us that looked to be roughly 10 miles off toward downtown Indianapolis.  The orbs were initially horizontal to one another, and had a slight shimmer.  At first we thought these might be helicopters or a military operation but the orbs were not moving any closer. Rather as we continued observation for the next minute or so, we saw the orb on the right make a sudden dip to a vertical formation.  The orb on top did not change position.  The orb on the bottom switched back to the horizontal formation and the vertical a couple more times. These were fast sharp movements that did not resemble a helicopter.  The orb that moved started to get closed to the other orb and was started to move behind the other orb. At this point, our daughter signaled us and moved her car.  We pulled into the garage, all the while keeping an eye on the orbs until we crossed the threshold into the garage. In the span of maybe 10 seconds that it took for us to park, and walk back out to the driveway the orbs has vanished.   I would not expect a helicopter or other conventional craft to simply vanish.;39.8487;-86.3782000000001
