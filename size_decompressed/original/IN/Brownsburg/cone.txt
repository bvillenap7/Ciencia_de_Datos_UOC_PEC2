4 symmetrically stationed lights that changed shapes.;2015-10-01 00:00:00;5 minutes;4 symmetrically stationed lights that changed shapes I was going to bed at midnight and noticed 4 lights, as I was looking south out my bedroom window.  The 4 lights were a distance away but were stationary across the sky, symmetrically apart, from east to west at the same height.  They were definitely not stars.  I also saw planes in the air, but these 4 lights had no movement and no flashing airplane lights.  I also noticed an aircraft in the air that I assumed was a helicopter sitting at a distance, as it was not moving (was stationary) with the usual flashing light. I noticed all 4 lights went from a dot to a vertical line that had multiple colors in the light...almost rainbow.  As they turned into lines of light there was no change in altitude with the lights. I woke my wife as I wanted someone else to see what I was seeing.  I decided to get my binoculars after a few minutes and when I returned, the lights had moved.  I believe I could see one yet farther away and when I looked in the binoculars, it seemed to be shaped like a waffle cone with the light as where the ice cream would be on the cone.  It was too far away to 100% know for sure. The skies seemed normal after that.  It seemed like a lot of extra planes were in the air when I saw the lights.;39.8487;-86.3782000000001
