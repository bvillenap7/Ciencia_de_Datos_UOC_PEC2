Stationary black disc.;2017-07-02 19:30:00;20 minutes;Stationary black disc I was doing Doordash (a food delivery service), driving back from Clermont, Indiana, into Brownsburg on US highway 136 I noticed a black object in the sky.  At first I thought it was just a hot air balloon or something.  It stayed stationary, the whole time I watched it.  I turned off of 136 onto 1000 e driving back to my home, I had no other deliveries.  The black circle was still just sitting in the sky so I drove up Cr400 to 900 e and got back on 136.  I pulled over in a church parking lot and watched it for about another 5minutes, it never moved an inch, just hovered silently in the sky, took a pic and recorded a 15 second video.;39.8487;-86.3782000000001
