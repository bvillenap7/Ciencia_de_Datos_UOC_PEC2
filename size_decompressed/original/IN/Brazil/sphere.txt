One looked very bluish colored, but changinging in color too. I was driving along the road and seen it pass by a star, so i pulled over.  I was with my friend Chels and she seen it too.  A nearby tree was blocking some view of the sky, but then another object came from the blocked area and into view. It was more Orangish in color. it moved and hovered.   They all did for a long time before they were out of sight. I was on the phone telling my friend in Terre Haute about it and he got his mom to look outside too.  They could see it better than me.  All i know is i posted a report about something just like this a year ago, and the same month. which is odd, this site listed it as a student report, or a hoax. believe me..... Im not kidding. I know what i saw.;39.5177;-87.1238000000001
