vanishing star over brazil indiana;2009-08-08 21:00:00;25 sec;vanishing star over brazil indiana I was at a family event when I stepped outside to have a cigarette.  It was about 9 o'clock not quite dark, I looked up to see if any stars were out I didn't see any looked again 2 seconds later and saw what I thought was 2 stars one dim and one very bright, brighter than Jupiter.  The bright one started moving south and upward very slow until it vanished.  I've never seen anything like it.  The whole thing lasted about 25 seconds.;39.5177;-87.1238000000001
