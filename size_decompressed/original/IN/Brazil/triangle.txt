3 FRIENDS SPOT GIANT LIGHT UFO THAT LINGERED FOR 4 HOURS  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2010-05-14 22:00:00;3 hours;3 FRIENDS SPOT GIANT LIGHT UFO THAT LINGERED FOR 4 HOURS Me and 2 other friends were recording some music yesterday evening and the night was going well. when we decided to pack up for the night. i had noticed a huge light in the sky about the house across the street. i could see it through the tops of the trees. it was magnificent. lower than usual flying heights of airplanes, which could be seen in other parts of the sky, this object clearly wasnt one. i told my friend who were still packing up there things that i thought there was a ufo in the sky. they thought i was stupid. i got them to come outside and take a look. it was still in the same spot. it was massive in size! maybe as big as 6-7 b52 bombers. the object illuminated and de-illuminated several times. we were in awe, i turned around and said ok guys lets get this stuff packed up so we you guys can get home. we turned away from the object.. i started walking .. i turned around for one more glimpse and the object was gone!!!!!!!! only to appear on the o! therside of the sky in less than 4-5 seconds!!! it did this 3 times and speeds nearly 1000-2500 mph... maybe faster. we watched as 2 more objects alot further away began to make a cluster and then they went behind the clouds... one friend went home after that but, me and my friend watched this object from 10:00pm to 1:00am. with its amazing movements and turns, capable of lowering itsself, and raising itsself, and stopping nearly on the dot,(no movement whatsoever) I truly believe in ufos now and im so sure it was a ufo i would take a lie detector polygraph test, test to prove it. so would my other 2 friends.;39.5177;-87.1238000000001
Strange maneuvering.;2014-06-17 00:43:00;2 hours;Triangle shaped objects with blinking yellow, red & blue/green round lights flying in almost a firefly type pattern.  Several of them making very strange maneuvering patters & at times, also appear to be hovering beside each other.  Can hear, what I describe as a rushing river like sound coming from the sky.;39.5177;-87.1238000000001
