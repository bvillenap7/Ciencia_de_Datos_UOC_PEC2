it was round with huge red lights;2003-12-09 00:00:00;2 minutes;it was round with huge red lights It was right above the tree tops not moving. From my view it looked like it had red lights going all the way around it. I started driving away and about 4 miles up the road i could see it floating slowly to the souteast. The scary part was it looked to be about half the size of a football field from the way the lights were spread out.  Thank you for your time;39.5177;-87.1238000000001
