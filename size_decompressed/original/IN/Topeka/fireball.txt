Breaking sound barrier from a dead stop.;2015-07-15 03:30:00;3 seconds;Breaking sound barrier from a dead stop. This all happened about 3 years ago.  Me and my friend were night fishing at Emma Lake near Topeka Indiana.  It was about 3:30 in the morning.  We were each in our own float tube.  I was facing the shore, he was facing the deep water.  I went to cast when I noticed a blue ball of fire popped up out of nowhere, about 20 feet above the trees.  Then another and another forming a giant circle.  The moment the last connected to the first and completed the circle, the whole center lit up.  I looked away for a moment and realized it was bright as daylight and I could see for miles.  Then I looked back at the light and BOOM!  It broke the sound barrier from a dead stop.  It all happened in about 3 seconds.  We never heard a sound before the engines fired up.  The sky was completely clear and we never saw it go over our heads.   At first I thought I fell asleep and had a wild dream, but just then my friend started freaking out about a bright light and a loud bangâ€¦.yes it was all too real.;41.5599;-85.5294
