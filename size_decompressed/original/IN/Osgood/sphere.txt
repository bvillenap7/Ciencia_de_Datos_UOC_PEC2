In the early morning hours I woke up to witness out of my bedroom window a white/candle light colored sphere flying around within the same area over a group of trees nearby. Not radical or very fast movements, more slow and intentional. This object stayed within the same area for the 2.5 hours I sat and watched. I did wake my husband to take a look and he witnessed it for the couple minutes before returning to bed. I did not witness the departure and am unsure of how much longer it stayed in that area. This object was much larger than the security light at a close neighboring farm and larger than the airplanes flying by for comparison. I did try to capture video from the bedroom window but oddly it wouldn't show up as big or clear as was seen by my eyes.;39.156;-85.2941
