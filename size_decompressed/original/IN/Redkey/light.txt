It was closely in-line with the lights from the Jay county grainery ( Anderson's) but was just off to the left and it was blinking red and yellow lights.  It was almost do West of where I was standing, which was my front yard,  Redkey, Indiana. It lasted for about 30 minutes and then slowly faded away to nothing.  It was not the lights from the grainery, not an airplane or jet.  Really, the only logical conclusion would be an unidentified object of some sort that just hovered.  I just checked again, (about 1 and 1/2 hours later) and there is nothing there.  No lights close to where the object was.  I would be curious to see if anyone else saw this.
