A slow moving flame with cupped milky vertical white disk behind it.;2010-07-04 22:30:00;5 minutes approximately;A slow moving flame with cupped milky vertical white disk behind it. First saw it slowly rising up above trees.  Then it went slowly northeast across the sky until it was out of our sight.   It looked like a yellow orange flame with a milky white, cupped circular shape behind it.  It didn't appear very large, not sure how high it was.   At first we thought it was some type of a fireworks that had been sent up, but it kept moving and staying just as bright.  It appeared to really move slow.   Spotted near the Stardust Hills Clubhouse parking lot. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));39.5213;-86.7924
