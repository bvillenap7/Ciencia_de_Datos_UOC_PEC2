Strage object flying over Ohio River, very large and moving slow.;2007-10-06 18:30:00;30 minutes;Strage object flying over Ohio River, very large and moving slow. On 10/06/07, my nephew and I were fishing in the Ohio River approximately 1 mile upstream of the Newburgh lock and dam.  At about 6:30 pm I noticed what at 1st looked like a huge plane over the KY side of the river. What was unusual was that it look like a plane with its wings tilted at approximately 30 degrees and coming directly at us.  I asked my nephew if he saw this and he confirmed that he had been watching it for a while and wasn't sure what he was looking at either.  We set there for 30 minutes or longer and watched this object fly east then change course and fly north-northeast.  For quite a while this object looked like it was flying toward us and tilted but then it began moving east.  It had lights on both ends of it and we estimated it had to be very large, mabye a quarter mile from end to end.  The lights on both ends blinked and were both red.  We thought that this was 2 planes at 1st, but it was definetely 1 object.  At no time was any noise noted from the object, or any plane aircraft noises heard during the siting.  This was a very weird object, flying at a very slow speed and I think that it was hovering when we thought it was coming directly at us.  Anyone with any info. on this would be appriciated.;38.0461;-87.2579000000001
A light drifted slightly to the left in the sky and then shot off into the distance and dissappeared.;2010-06-29 21:05:00;4 seconds;A light drifted slightly to the left in the sky and then shot off into the distance and dissappeared. I was riding my motorcycle outside of my house at 21:05.   I stopped to take a break and rest when I looked up into the eastern sky and saw a white light about the size of the tip of a headphone jack.   When I saw it, it drifted southward and then 2 seconds later it flew eastward and up and disappeared faster than any human made aircraft could.   The whole sighting lasted a total of 3 or 4 seconds.   There are no air force bases close to where I live and the nearest airport only has commercial aircraft.   I see no reason for any fast air force aircraft to be flying near this area at 21:00 hours.;38.0461;-87.2579000000001
Silent bright orange light in sky drifting, jumping and or teleporting.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly not a serious report??  PD));2019-06-01 01:08:00;20 minutes;Silent bright orange light in sky drifting, jumping and or teleporting Could have possibly been two craft but looked like one craft jumping around.  Orange light with no sound seen in the east.  Would appear, drift downward and to the south and at one point started to fade out and teleported back to the east at least a mile from where it was in a literal blink of an eye.  When it made the teleport and reappeared it was bright and vibrant almost like it was putting on a show for us. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether this is a serious report.
