Strange Day of Sightings;2004-12-27 07:35:00;07:35-16:00;Strange Day of Sightings I took these photos starting early AM. At first I thought someone had been peering through my window prior to sunrise. Next on my way home from my parents I noticed what appeared to be two suns in the sky. When I got home I retrieved my camera to photograph them. When I went outside and looked to the sky there was an inverted rainbow in place of one of the suns. Could you possibly shed some light on these photos I've attached?;38.6529;-87.1699
