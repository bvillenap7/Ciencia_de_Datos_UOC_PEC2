Bright Orange Lights in Southern Indiana in NW Sky;2005-08-23 21:40:00;45 seconds;Bright Orange Lights in Southern Indiana in NW Sky I let the dog out around 9:40 pm local time & noticed a bright orange ball of light in the West-Northwestern sky. It appeared & then disappeared.  I thought it was a helicopter at first that turned away from me (no sound).  Then the bright light reappeared with a orange spike going straight up into the clouds & disappeared again.  Again, maybe a helicopter with a spotlight? Then the orange light appeared the final time, splitting into two equally bright orange lights before they both disappeared. I went back out with binoculars, but nothing else happened. (In fact, I am going back out now.);38.6529;-87.1699
