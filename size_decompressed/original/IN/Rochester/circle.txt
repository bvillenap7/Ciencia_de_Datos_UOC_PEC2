I was looking to the west from my front door and seen these cicles in the sky which were orange in color.They were only there a very short time and disappeared. Then my husband went to our kitchen table to get a snack to eat and looked out the window to the south west and seen what i had seen minutes earlier.By the time i got to the window to look out they had disappeared again.We didnt know what they were,but wondered if it might be a ufo.The next day i told my daughter about what we had seen and she told me to report it because another woman in the Rochester erea had seen the same thing.;41.0662;-86.2385
