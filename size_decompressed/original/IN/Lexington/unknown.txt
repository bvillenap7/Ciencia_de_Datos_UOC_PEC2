Interestingly was it seemed to have a well-defined start and end from a direction of WSW to ENE or a heading of 60 degrees from north.  A very small of indistinguishable shape object in the front seemed to be the source of the smokey emission. After the passing of a minute or so, the apparent emitting object was a visual one-inch at 20-inch arm’s length ahead of the trail. The trail appeared to be 4” long.  To observe better, we drove under a cross-country power line to give us good visual reference at distance to observe two more features, one of which was the trail and the object appeared not to move for about 2 minutes and contact was lost with the object either as darkness was approaching or just too small to see.  The trail after 5 minutes of observation seemed to begin to break up.  Its total length never appeared to be greater than 4 inches at the 20 inch arm length. The color of the trail was much darker than a jet would have been. My explaination.  The dispersion of the trail gave the appearance of something at altitudes between 5,000 and 50,000 feet running an internal combustion engine with piston that had just broken an oil ring or an oil leak in an engine causing a black smoke to come from the engine until the engine exhausted all its oil and locked up or shut down.  Though the sun had just set, the sky was well bright enough to distinguish this event from a standard jet trail by virtue of the darkness of the apparent smoke.  The other unique feature was the sudden start of the trail and the sudden end to the trail and the extremely small object continuing with a 060 heading after the smoke trail finished.
