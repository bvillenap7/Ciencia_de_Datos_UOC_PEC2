Bright orange horizontal band of lights seen by husband and wife.;2015-08-14 22:15:00;2 minutes;Bright orange horizontal band of lights seen by husband and wife. While driving home from work, I noticed a band of approximately 4 bright orange lights in the Northeast sky.  It appeared as though the lights were stretching apart from each other in a horizontal line.  As quickly as they appeared I lost sight of them.   I continued home and kept my eye toward the sky where I had seen the lights and as I pulled in my driveway (maybe 2 minutes later, at best) I noticed them again.  This time there seemed to be more lights or that the lights were multiplying as they separated.  I got my husband’s attention to have him look to see them and he did.  The lights maybe lasted a few seconds before disappearing either behind a tree line or all together from the night sky. 	This sighting comes after two other unexplainable lights I have seen in the same general direction of the sky over the last two or three weeks.  The first was probably two weeks ago, appearing as a bright red light in the sky that “burnt up” in just a few seconds. 	The second was just a few days ago, either Monday August 10, 2015, or Tuesday, August 11, 2015.   It was like a fireball that flashed and was gone.  I know that the meteor shower was going on this week, but I watched that and those were nothing like any of the three strange sightings I’ve had.;38.7517;-85.7954
