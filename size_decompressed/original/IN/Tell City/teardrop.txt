Object was bigger than small plane but no noise was heard. sky was clear. object went out of sight obstructed from view by roof of my house. when looking for object to reappear in my view noticed four other objects further north same color. objects were moving together but not equal distances between them. objects appeared to be moving at same rate but slower than a small plane. objects were pretty in the night sky, solid bright red with yellow around the edge. I don't know what they were, have not seen anything this size,color,shape to compare it to. sister in law states she saw eight objects and lives approx eight blocks away. I only observed for approx five minutes and went back into the house.;37.9684;-86.7449
