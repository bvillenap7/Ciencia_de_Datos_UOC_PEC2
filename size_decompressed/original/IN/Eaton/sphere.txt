2 bright non blinking, moving stars. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD));2009-09-08 21:30:00;5 minutes;2 bright non blinking, moving stars My husband and I were sitting by the fire looking at the stars. It was a very clear night and the stars were very visible. I noticed two bright stars in the western sky diagonal from one another that began to move very slowly at first and then faster, keeping perfect distance. No blinking lights and no noise they moved from the west to the NE in sync for about 45 seconds until they disappeared like the lights had just been turned off. A few moments later several planes appeared to be surrounding they area where the stars had been, coming from all directions. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.
