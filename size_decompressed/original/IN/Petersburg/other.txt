Pulsating orange orbs followed by bright white orb seen over Petersburg, Indiana;2020-06-16 23:40:00;10 minutes;Pulsating orange orbs followed by bright white orb seen over Petersburg, Indiana Two pulsating orange orbs were spotted in the sky, observed from Princeton Indiana and appearing to be above Petersburg Indiana. I saw them as I was driving, first assuming they were planes. As I watched they continued to float in a stationary position approximately one mile apart from each other in perfect alignment. After approximately 10 minutes they simply vanished. The conditions of the skies were completely clear with no possibility of clouds or fog covering the objects. They appeared a second time in the same area nearly one hour later, having the same alignment as well as the same color. Once again, they vanished without any movement. I would like to note that the pulsation was in sync with each orb and very different from the blinking light of any standard aircraft. I would also like to note that approximately one hour after the orbs disappeared the second time, in the same location as before, there was a sudden bright white orb that lit for a few s! econds and then also vanished.;38.4792;-87.2834
