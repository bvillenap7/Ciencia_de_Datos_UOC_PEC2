It was a dot in the sky at first I thought it was a satellite.  But it stopped in its tracks and went back the other way.It went up and down and back and forth. That was on the 3rd of October In the west sky early in the morning.  Then a week later on the 10th of October I seen it again but this time it was a 9:30 or 10:00 pm.  This time it was in the north sky and it was doing the same thing. Going up and down and back and forth. their looks to be a blinking or rotating light on it.  Today is October 14th and I have seen it again this morning it started at 530am and is 630am right now and is still out their.  It is back in the west sky this morning.  The 1st time I seen it I called the police and reported it but did not leave my name and number but this is the 3rd time I have seen it and don't know who to tell anymore I just want to know if anyone else has seen it as well in the western Sky's over southern Indiana!;38.4383;-85.9258
