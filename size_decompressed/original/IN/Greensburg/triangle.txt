In Decatur County , Indiana (08/04/10 ) I was watching the cloud to cloud lighting that was caused by the Solar Flares when I spotted a light coming in that looked eerie,  I immediately yelled for my wife, she ran out to join my on our upstairs balcony. It was steadily coming straight towards us, WITHOUT A SOUND not following nor preceding....silent! But what i found the craziest was the feeling in my gut and back and legs, i felt vibrations internally i cannot begin to describe the feeling! Anyway this thing is maybe 100-150 yards above the corn field and steadily heading DIRECTLY over our heads we both look up in amazement and hold each others hands...the whole time my 3 yr old daughter standing in the doorway watching... As these lights moved closer, We both knew it wasn't a vehicle of any sort that we have seen before. Brightest lights at it's point of direction , with a tiny blue light one either sides of the lead point and the eerie glow of the two corners that had lights but weren't as piercing as its head point. It was obviously triangle the background being illuminated by cloud 2 cloud lightning, this was a steadily approaching triangular craft that had 4-5 lights in the center that were illuminated in different grades of firey RED, it didn't spin at all like always imagined...so after it flew directly above our heads we ran out the other side of our place to watch it leave, it left as it came silent, and steadyâ€¦;39.2998;-85.4918
Large triangular shaped object  with 3 white lights and 1 blinking red light flew directly over us at very low speed and altitude.;2011-11-30 22:30:00;10 minutes;Large triangular shaped object  with 3 white lights and 1 blinking red light flew directly over us at very low speed and altitude. We were walking to our house and looked up to see a very large triangular shaped object directly overhead.  It had three white lights on it's underside and one blinking red light on the back.  It was almost silent and was flying very low at a tremendously slow speed.  It looked very flat and. I could not believe how slow it was moving.  It took between 10 to 15 minutes to get out of sight.  It was moving southeast.;39.2998;-85.4918
