This is the second time I have seen it.  The first time was about a month ago and it was directly in fron of me.  It wa alot closer to the ground, as I aproached it turned its lights out and as I was searching for it, I seen a shadow of it in the dark like it just glided on its side and thats when I seen it was a circular shape.  It flew lightspeed in the air.  I got 2 pictures of it but I was driving and they r not that great.  I seen it again this morning like I said and it scared me.  I couldn't hardley pullout of my drive way.  By the time I got to my phone because I wanted to camcord it, it was gone.  I am very scared. I don't know if they are here for a natural resource, if its the goernment.  Please take this seriously, I am a mother  of four kids and take care of my grandson, I don't know what they want. If they will cause harm.;39.2998;-85.4918

Disappeared I was beginning to rest for the night after a sleepless day, when what I thought was just a star, started moving. I began gazing, and it begun to come closer, where I could make out a disc with 3 semi-circles on the edges.  It frightened me, and I stumbled for my phone, yet, it was on my desk, and I was on the far end of my bed.  I told my mother, which she ridiculed me, and there seems to he still eat another star in a similar position, which seems to change colors, and occasionally disappear from sight, tonight,  May 2nd-3rd,  Iâ€™m ready to capture it, if I see it, of course.;39.2998;-85.4918
