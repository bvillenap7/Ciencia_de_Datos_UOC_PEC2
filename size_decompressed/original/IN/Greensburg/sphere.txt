Large red orb or sphere traveling East to West just below cloud line.  The sphere was about the size of a large grapefruit at arm's length in the sky.  The object was solid in color and had red protrusions from top and bottom like if you took a grapefruit and stuck a pickle through it.  It was all one object and did not glow or flash.  There was no distortion of the light.   Although our first thought was that a plane was exploding, it soon became obvious that this was not a plane or helicopter.  It seemed high in altitude and moved silently across the night sky, becoming smaller and smaller until it blinked out and disappeared.  Our general impression was that it was UAP under intelligent control.;39.2998;-85.4918
