I have wanted her to relate this story for a long time but she does not have access to the net. In the winter of 76 her and her girl friend were coming home from a meeting and were driving on a lonely country road when her friend said look at that helicopter. my sister said, That is no helicopter, and she asked her friend to stop the car. Her friend freaked out and floored the gas pedal. The bright triangle object followed them to my sisters lonely farm house and was over the barn when they pulled into the drive. My sister got out of the car and the object slowly moved above her.it did not make a sound. her friend was hystrical and began to yell for my sisters boyfriend to come outside. The object was directly over my sister and she looked up and saw a trangle shape at tree top level . A beam of light shown down on her and  she looked down because she was afraid it would hurt her eyes. At her feet was a cat and the beam broke and also shown on the cat. by this time her boyfriend was at the door and when he slammed the screendoor the light went out. The object moved off through the corn fields and when it was far away a bunch of lights that were thought ,at the time, to be stars fell  to link up to it. I know this sounds crazy but she cannot tell this without tears in her eyes and getting all shakey. We knew nothing about abductions at the time so we know of no missing time.;39.5676;-86.488
