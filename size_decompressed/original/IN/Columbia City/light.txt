shafts of red and blue lights;2001-05-27 23:00:00;6-hours;shafts of red and blue lights At around 11:00 pm on the 27th of May a friend and I were sitting in a hot tub when i observed what at first i thought was a plane. IIt moved accross the sky at too high a rate of speed to be one though. It came to a stop and hovered at what I would estimate to be between 3-8 thousand feet. it was a vertical shaft of white/yellow light with a red light shaped like an upside down horseshoe at the bottom. it pulsated and dimed. when bright it had a triangular shaped light near the top. it made no sound as it moved. it stayed in it's hover and sometimes turned, bobbed around and weaved. then i noticed further away another one with a similar shape and color pattern. at times these ufo's alighned themselves at the same angles as if in formation. they stayed like this for approximately 2 hours before i saw what i thought was some sort of helicopter or plane comeing to check them out. it turned out to be another craft that was more square in shape and seemed to sparkle or light up at a more rapid rate. this smaller craft seemed lower to the ground, maybe around 2-3 thousand feet. what was striking about all of this is that it was a fairly cloudy night, but when the ufo's were presant the clouds seemed to part the same way a boat makes a wake behind it. dogs in the neighborhood were howling as this was taking place. these ufo's could move in any direction and made no sound. the sky/clouds seemed to take on a reddish hue when they were lit. they would dim themselves then get bright again. they left after a few hours then came back at around 3-4am ...same cloud wake, same position in the sky...right before they left the one closest to me seemed to approach the other farther away then they dissapeared. it was the greatest thing i ever saw in my life and i will go to my grave believing that what i saw could not be of this earth.;41.1622000000001;-85.4724
Two orange-yellow lights quietly and quickly from east to west over town;2007-01-02 23:00:00;1 minute;Two orange-yellow lights quietly and quickly from east to west over town At approximately 11:00pm was sitting in family room had just finished watching TV show started to get up from chair at east end of house which has a large window on ground floor curtains were opened, I just happened to notice light headed west towards house seemed too be moving at quick pace, just struck me as odd because of speed and low altitude. I quickly got out the back door to get a look at it. Appeared to be two lights side by side, both appeared to be an orange yellow color. During the sighting listened carefully for sound but heard nothing. There were no flashing lights.When it came from the east it appeared to be one light as it passed it was a definite two lights heading east. Fort Wayne has a Samaritan helicopter but I've seen it at night and you certainly can hear it for an extended period of time.;41.1622000000001;-85.4724
a light appeared and slowly moved with a zigzag motion then disappeared;2011-07-09 22:53:00;approximately 1 minute;a light appeared and slowly moved with a zigzag motion then disappeared The observers were looking at the stars when a star appeared.   It immediately started moving slowly with a slight zig- zag motion.   When it reached the center of our view it brightened for about two seconds then started fading as it continued across the sky.  Then as suddenly as it appeared it disappeared.   The sky was clear and it was 74 degrees farenheit.;41.1622000000001;-85.4724
Star-like point of light moved S to N, disappearing, reappearing, one burst of light, continued out of sight in night sky.;2014-06-07 01:15:00;1-2 minutes;Star-like point of light moved S to N, disappearing, reappearing, one burst of light, continued out of sight in night sky. Looking out the north window at the sky as I often do before going to sleep, the Big Dipper was to my left, stars dotted the dark sky.   Directly above, I thought I saw a jet heading south to north.  It was white, or star-like, but a pinpoint, very high up, moving steadily much as a plane but without strobe lights which are usually visible.  It disappeared & reappeared a few times, yet the sky seemed cloudless.  (Weather tonight clear & calm.)   Suddenly there was a flash or burst of light as the object continued north, disappearing & reappearing before going out of sight. Writer is UNE graduate medical assistant.
