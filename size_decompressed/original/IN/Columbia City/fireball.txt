row of arange balls in the sky.;2008-03-06 20:00:00;5-8 SEC;row of arange balls in the sky. I was driving home from work at about 8:oo pm when I noticed in the sky a row of orange balls not sure on the number but would say between 8 and 10 all in a straight row would guess at least 100 yrds in length. Visible for about 5 seconds and then were gone. I drove another 3 miles and saw another 3 balls much farther away in a different part of the sky for about 3 seconds and then they were gone.;41.1622000000001;-85.4724
