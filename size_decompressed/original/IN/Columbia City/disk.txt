Flying saucer with blinking lights that zigzagged.;2015-04-23 01:30:00;20 minutes;Flying saucer with blinking lights that zigzagged. I was intensely looking all over the sky attempting to see a meteor shower when I spotted what I first thought was an airplane, but I am 99% sure it was not. It was saucer shaped with 3-4 visible horizontal lights, one red, the others white, that flashed one after the other in a row. The saucer stayed almost perfectly in place except for zigzagging every 10 seconds or so. I watched it for 20 minutes before I got too cold and went back inside.;41.1622000000001;-85.4724
