That night east of C. City on US 30 in the 70's;1979-06-30 21:00:00;15 min;That night east of C. City on US 30 in the 70's We had gone to Ohio earlier in the day to deliver custom vans and trucks.  We were returning to the Lake areas and heading east on US 30 outside Columbia City/Ft Wayne.  Off in the distance we could see a slow moving glowing object up fairly high heading east over the double highway. When it got closer it was lower and lower to the highway.   There was five of us in the car and we were so shocked that I pulled over and we got out of the car to look. It was triagular shaped, lightly glowing underneath and you could see metal pockets and various pipes,etc.  We heard some noice, but not a jet sound or engines.  As it was almost completely over us and larger than both sides of the double highway, we were scared and we got back in the car and took off fast.  We all agreed that we knew we all saw a UFO that night and there was five of us who saw the same thing.   One passenger, however, saw the same thing coming across a corn feild near her home later that evening and was frightened that it was coming for her.  We will never forget it and when we see each other now 30 years later, we always mention it to each other where no one will here us.

Object hovers and melts frozen pond.;2005-01-31 22:00:00;3 minutes;Object hovers and melts frozen pond. This was an evening of ice fishing I will never forget!  Coming over the trees was an elongated triangular shaped thing.  It was hovering over the east end of the small farm pond I was fishing.  It moved over the frozen water and lowered slowly.  It sat motionless without a sound for a minute or two.  As it rose silently, steam rose from the lake.  The object slipped quietly past the trees and floated out of sight (my line of sight was obscured by trees).  We used our cell phone and called the local sherriff, but there was no answer, as our cell phones had both gone dead.  This was strange.  Also, our battery operated fish locator (Vexilar) was also affected, we believe.  The area of the pond where the object hovered was melted into about 2 inches.;41.1622000000001;-85.4724
