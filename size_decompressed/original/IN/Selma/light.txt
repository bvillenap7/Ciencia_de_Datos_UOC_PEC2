Long line of lights and disappeared.   ((Starlink satellites??));2020-03-05 20:15:00;45 mins and still happeni;Long line of lights and disappeared Went out side to lock up vehicle and was looking at moon and planes in sky. Then I noticed a line of white lights that looked like a small star which I thought were military craft flying real high in a line. They were coming from the south west going north east. They were not blinking any. I went and got my binoculars and watched them. No noise, very high up, probably a mile or so between them, counted at least 40 to 50. As I watched them they all got to a certain point in the sky and then they faded and vanished. Some turned and then vanished. Just went back out and there is several that are going in different directions and then vanished a couple stopped and then started moving again then vanished. Going back out again to watch them, this is so strange, if they are military I would say they would have to be drones. But they are acting irregular and two of them cross paths and turned to just one, I know some of the commercial air planes had to see them, the! y were close to some and crossed paths. Will update if anything new, thanks;40.1721;-85.2736
