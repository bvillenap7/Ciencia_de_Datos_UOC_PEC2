Light Grey cylinder going slowly across the sky.  It appeared about the same height as an airplane (we live approx. 20 miles from Baer Field Airport).  I watched it going across the sky for maybe 30 - 40 seconds?  I then tried to take a picture with my cell phone.  It was getting ready to go into the clouds when I decided I needed to get a picture fast. I stopped the car, opened the moon roof, and stuck my phone into the air and took the picture.  Either it went away instantly or went behind the clouds, but itâ€™s not on my phone.  It was a clear sky and there were white clouds, I saw it clear it perfectly.  My background (as the observer)  I have a full time job, raising children, have a husband.  Have never reported or saw any thing prior.  I was coming home from work. I was not drinking and i do not do drugs.;40.989;-84.8944
