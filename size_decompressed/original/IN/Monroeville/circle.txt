Large sphere with bright lights landed in the woods in Monroeville, IN.;2004-04-03 23:30:00;10 minutes;Large sphere with bright lights landed in the woods in Monroeville, IN. The object looked like a very round ball very well lit with red and white lights.  It descended into the woods behind our house from way up in the sky to the ground in less than ten minutes, but it was floating down, unlike a plane or helicopter.   The closer it got to landing, the closer we got to it and we watched it descend all the way down into a wooded area.   As soon as the object softly landed, all of the lights went out and it was never found.;40.989;-84.8944
