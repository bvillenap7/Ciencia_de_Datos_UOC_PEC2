Green orb-like fireball over Schererville, IN appearing twice;2013-08-07 21:00:00;10 minutes;Green orb-like fireball over Schererville, IN appearing twice I’m from Schererville, Indiana.  On August 7, 2013 around 9:00 p.m., my friend and I saw a green orb-like fireball that was glowing and looked spherical. It headed east behind the trees.  It was very cloudy around this time of night and the object was clearly visible below the clouds.  The object appeared bigger than a star and did not look like any airplane, helicopter, or anything ordinary.  At first, we didn’t really think much of it and continued towards our friend’s house heading east.   Then, around 9:10 p.m., I happened to glance west to see the same green orb-like fireball motionless in the sky.  It slowly descended down by slightly swaying left once, then right once, then straight down.   We immediately tried to pursue the object on our skateboards, but did not see the object again for the rest of the night.  I spoke with Mr. Davenport later that evening.;41.4901;-87.4584
