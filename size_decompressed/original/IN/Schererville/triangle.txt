Triagular shapped objest with red lights moving fast, stopped, then disappeared;2008-12-02 19:30:00;3 minutes;Triagular shapped objest with red lights moving fast, stopped, then disappeared I was driving to to a friends house on december 2nd of 2008. Something in the sky to my right caught my eye. It looked like either three lights or a triaglular shape i wasnt sure. The lights were red and the object was moving very fast then it stopped abruptly. I parked my car on the side of the and grabbed my phone to take a pictures of it as i took out my phone it started to move again then it disappeared I couldn't believe what I saw. Then two days later I saw a similar object but the lights were green this object was moving extremely fast to fast to be a plane and like the other disappeared.;41.4901;-87.4584
Multiple hovering orange sphere/orbs in a broken triangle shape over Hwy. 30;2011-08-05 21:15:00;2 min.;Multiple hovering orange sphere/orbs in a broken triangle shape over Hwy. 30 While traveling E. BOUND ON US30 through Schererville and entering Merrillville.  I observed at least 4 maybe 5 orange spheres/orbs which seemed to just hover with no sound over the highway, they were under 400 ft. approx. These lights were spread out into a broken triangle and seemed to just appear or catch my eye.  I sensed a very sureal feeling and was totally shocked and amazed.  My mind was racing with questions. With narrow sholders on the road and heavy traffic I did not stop but slowed down.  One light was larger (sphere) and the others seemed more like orbs. It was cloudy and I could not discern if they were connected.   About one quarter of a mile I turned off Hwy. 30 to enter Crown Point and looking back to my right I could still see one orange orb, lighting up the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  For some reason, witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.4901;-87.4584
