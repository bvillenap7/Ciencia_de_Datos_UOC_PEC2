Very large dark gray object with possible windows flying low.;2017-04-21 14:45:00;15 minutes;Very large dark gray object with possible windows flying low. I was driving my semi on highway 36 and seen this object flying low above the tree line.  I actually followed it from Palestine, Ohio, into Lynn, Indiana, and then lost sight of it.   The object was very large, and looked grayish black or dark gray, and about the size of 2-3 football fields long.   I have a video of the craft on my cell phone as I tried photographing it while driving.;40.0515;-84.9287
