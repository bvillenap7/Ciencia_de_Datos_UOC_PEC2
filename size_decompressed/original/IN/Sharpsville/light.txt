I looked at the latest sightings and found April 16th 2005...Oh my, others did see this event! It was Prom night, we parents had gathered at a home for the eveing. I was on the back patio smoking outside with two others when I looked just above the house to the NW.. 2 bright lights then 2 more,and 2 more I believe a total of 8.came on 2 at a time all in a row, straight line.. Then they went off beginning at both ends, not quickly but dimmimg out..I said What the hell is that?! One of us went to get her husband to look out the North side of house but the lights were gone.. There was no sound at all. To this day we talk about this and don't know what it was...I have never seen anything like this before!!;40.3725;-86.1053
