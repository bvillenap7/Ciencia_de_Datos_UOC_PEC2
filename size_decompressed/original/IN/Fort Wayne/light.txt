Blinking, fast unknown object flying over downtown Fort Wayne, IN;2020-07-28 22:15:00;10-15 minutes;Blinking, fast unknown object flying over downtown Fort Wayne, IN While watching the ISS pass over fort wayne, in around 10:10pm, I noticed another object flying west of the ISS.  The object was significantly bigger in comparison of the ISS.  We couldn't really tell the shape being it was dark out and it was flashing from white to red every few seconds.  The timing of the changing of colors wasnt in a specific pattern.  The object would stop and hover, then move east.  It was going a good speed when it eventually went out of sight heading east. Roughly two minutes later we see it back in view heading back from wence we seen it at first.  The object then proceeded to head west until we no longer could see it anymore. We thought it was a drone at first, but the way it was acting and the speed this thing had has us thinking otherwise now.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
