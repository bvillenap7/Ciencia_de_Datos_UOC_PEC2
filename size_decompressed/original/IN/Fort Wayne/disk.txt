Close Encounters of the ??? Kind;1977-10-27 23:30:00;10 minutes;Close Encounters of the ??? Kind This was sometime during the fall of 1977. I was six years old.  My father was stationed at Ft. Wayne, Indiana.  Our family was late night fishing at a lake near the military installation.  The lake was in a secluded wooded area.  The approximate time was 11:30 p.m. I recall that it was a clear and cool night.  The object first appeared in the distance flying military crest along the mountains.  We could only see the lights which were approximately 5-8 miles away.  My father, an aircraft mechanic for the Army, was not sure of the object.  He stated that it was moving too fast for a helicopter and flying much too low and fast to be a prop aircraft.  We ignored it after that it wasn’t until 15 minutes later the object was hovering near us at the lake.  It was approximately 100 ft from our location, in the open observing us.  We remained motionless and stared at the craft during the entire duration.  The object was hovering 50 ft off the ground.  It was a disc shaped objec! t about 75 ft in diameter, with domes above and below the main hull.  Lights of various colors flashed around the domes.  The craft was silent and remained hovering for 10 mins before lifting off slowly, heading away from our location then accelerated quickly out of sight.  I will never forget this night.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
5 disc shaped objects flyin in unicon with no lights...........;2008-03-22 22:00:00;20-25 sec.;5 disc shaped objects flyin in unicon with no lights........... My girlfriend and I were leaving her apartment to go to the store at 9:54 exact.  She lives in an area where there is not much light pollution. There is some from a near by gas station and some street lights and a liquor store and houses that would emit light.  I walked out first and she was still up stairs locking the door.  I’m an observant person and always look up at the sky to see what stars are out.  I waited at the steps for her to grab her things and lock the door.  We began to walk to her car and I was still looking up and was going to comment on how it would be a good night for telescopes. When I looked up, there were five disc shaped objects flying in a perfect diagonal line heading north east.  I was scared at first and extremely uneasy. The car wanst unlocked yet and she noticed me acting out of sorts and I remember saying, look, look, look up!!!  I was frantic. I ran around the car and grabbed her head and pointed her eyes to the sky where they should have been, but there was nothing. They had disappeared. After the sighting I became tremendously nervous about what I have seen.  I have always wished to see a U.F.O. and now, I wished I haven’t. There were five of them in a perfect diagonal line flying north east. There was no sound and no lights. I believe they were pretty close in proximity to the ground.  They moved very gracefully in formation, they had to have been at least 20-25 feet apart from each other.  I know as well as anyone that balloons do not fly in such a tight pattern. The only way these objects were visible is due to the very low lights in the area it seemed like five soft balls flying together.  I don’t know any other way to describe them.  I have called the local authorities to tell them about this sighting. I have always believed in U.F.O.s and now I wish I have never seen these tonight.  I am honestly scared and excited at the same time.  I dunno. I wish to get in contact with people that share the same. I am a smart person and I know that these objects were not of anything made by man.  I wish I have never saw them.  I would rather wonder than to know now.

4 white disk shape objects circling at the night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the lights might have been advertising lights.  PD));2012-10-07 11:18:00;2 minutes;4 white disk shape objects circling at the night sky. 4 white disk-shaped objects circling at night sky.  Going round-and-round every 2 seconds. They make circles around the night sky and then come together at one dot, and they resume the circling motion.  The circling motion also moves as my car movies continuously from one spot to another.  Then I was forced to stop my car to let the pedestrians cross who live at my apartment (Island Club Apartment). I am a first year pharmacy student and I have no religious background.

Blue saucer above I-69 and DuPont Road exit.;2014-09-16 21:00:00;15 minutes;Blue saucer above I-69 and DuPont Road exit. Craft was traveling north to south above I-69 from 469 to DuPont rd exit.   Craft changed colors from a bright two tone blue and dark blue then change to red and white lights.   As to us that were video taping craft, it would kill all the lights every 20-30 seconds and then turn them back on.   No motor sounds what so ever.  Craft was seen for 15 min then it turned off lights and disappeared in the night sky.   Elevation of the craft was roughly 200-300 feet.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271

All of a sudden a saucer shaped object went by at a very fast and low in the sky. I have never seen anything fly that fast.  And i could see the shape of it very clearly. It had two lights on it very bright.  They were on the side I was seeing, they were in the middle of the side, a little ways apart. In a seconds time, the saucer went straight up in the air at a high rate of speed. It was heading south, before it went straight up and vanished;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271

At first thought it was a place then it turned sideways and showed its circular shape. dozens of lights flickered like none on any plane.  The craft zoomed off for a second of two only to reappear and fly in my direction next.  It did the same disappearance after this and didn't come back.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
Cream-colored saucer photographed over Fort Wayne, Indiana.;2016-07-31 15:00:00;~2 seconds;cream colored saucer photographed over Fort Wayne, Indiana. I was outside taking pictures of the clear blue sky after cleaning my Canon Rebel T3 digital camera checking for dust on the mirror.   I noticed one of the photos, a cream colored saucer shaped object towards the top left.   I didn't see it with the naked eye, so I don't know what direction it was traveling.  It appears large and at a high altitude.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
3 glowing objects moving due West. Non blinking lights. No noise of craft.;2019-11-16 19:03:00;12 secs;3 glowing objects moving due West. Non blinking lights. No noise of craft. I saw a bright object in the sky.  Figured it was a airplane taking off from local airport then noticed just how bright it was and that it did NOT have blinking lights.  Watched that for a few seconds then noticed two more of the same things nearly overhead but off to the right.  They were moving at a pretty good speed but not blindingly fast or anything.  They were travelling next to each other but separated by a few hundred yards.  Watched for a few seconds. Looked back at the first one and it was gone.  It thought it might of gone behind a cloud. Looked back at the two.  They were all orangey red.  Disc shaped. Flat but almost a flame like quality.  Noticed what I thought might be three lights on edge of disc. But hard to discern clearly due to the glow of the disc.  I had been walking toward my truck this whole time and was going to pass past it and get to the field but I had to look down to step over the curb. When I looked up the two were gone as well. At the sp! eed they were going they might of reached the cloud as well. At no time did I see any navigational lights blinking or did I HEAR anything as I watched the sky for another 30 seconds.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271

The closer we got to Walden Addition we noticed an object with lights to the right of us he hovering above the houses to the left of us.  The object was very large.  Larger than a drone or helicopter.  It maneuvered in many different directions.  Up down, side to side.  We stopped on the side of the road to get a closer look.  The object began to get closer to my car.  I continued to drive down Vance to our destination.  The object began to follow us.  I sped up and the object still was above us.  We got to the destination and dropped off the kids.  We continued to drive home and my son saw the object hovering above the houses as if it was waiting on us.  We sped home and it took off very fast in the other direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Time indicated by source of original report was flawed.  We have amended the time, in order to reflect a nighttime sighting.  PD));41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271

It was on its side and reflective and luminous. There was the disc and around it was a pulsating energy. My husband and I saw it while coming back from my sisters house on Maples Road facing East as it crossed above us in the air and looked like it was getting ready to land. The disc was flying across the road in a South direction. We only saw it for a few seconds. It was definitely not a falling star. The object appeared to be the size of a large house.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
