Stationary Sphere Viewed Off Tip of Crescent Moon Not Far From Ft. Wayne, Indiana;1996-08-18 23:00:00;20 minutes;Stationary Sphere Viewed Off Tip of Crescent Moon Not Far From Ft. Wayne, Indiana I was returning from visiting my son in Ft. Wayne, Indiana and while driving down Hwy 33 heading towards St Rd 6 traveling NW towards Elkhart, Indiana area, I witnessed what I now believe to be an Orb or Sphere shaped object.  I was in the country area just about 50 miles NW of Ft. Wayne and I happened to look up at the cresent moon which was to the left of my drivers window.  What caught my eye was that just off the tip of the cresent moon, there was an object which reminded me of a drop of water haning off the tip of the moon.  I starred for a while and determined that it was definitely not a star.  I could see that it had a circular shape and reflected the sun light as did the moon. I continued to see the object (which never moved from its hanging off the tip of the moon position.  And eventually the road turned and I stopped paying attention.   But when I got home, I was so baffled by what I had seen, that I called the local weather station and asked about possible satelites in the area, but was told there werent any that i could see or anything that would be there like I described.  I have recently seen videos and pictures of what I can now saw if very much like what I thought i saw that night.  And due to the fact that these spheres have been documented as moving and being still, i do believe that is what i saw that night.   All I know for sure is that it was NOT A STAR!   And it was not there later on in the night.  Since it was a routine journey, it did not have a camera on hand unfortunately.

Group of orange lights passing southward in sky;2014-07-17 09:00:00;10 minutes;Group of orange lights passing southward in sky I was walking out of work to my work van and glanced up at a jet passing over in the distance and noticed two faint orange lights which appeared to be behind the jet and at a much higher altitude.  (The jet could have been leaving the Fort Wayne Int’l airport).    As I put on my polarized sunglasses the lights became much clearer and I noticed at total of five lights.  Three were stacked vertically and two were side by side horizontally – which were a bit lower and to the left than the 3 vertical ones.  They were moving slowly south/southeast.  As they made their way south I saw another one to the North end of the sky line, and then one more that either became more noticeable or “appeared” to its left. It’s possible that they were Chinese lanterns but they seemed far too high and bright given the clear sky and full daylight.  Also, I checked the wind direction at Intellicast.com under their local weather report and the timestamp at 08:54 showed the wind moving 6mph NNW. My cell phone does not take great pictures, so I pulled my digital cam out of my book bag but the battery was exhausted go figure.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
