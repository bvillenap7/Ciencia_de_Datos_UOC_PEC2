Red, blue, green, and white lights flashing from a circular craft.  ((NUFORC Note:  Object may have been Sirius.  PD));2009-01-31 18:40:00;1 hour;Red, blue, green, and white lights flashing from a circular craft seem to be commucating with other small circlular crafts to the west. On January 31, 2009 at 6:30 pm, my family and I were traveling east on State Street and in the sky my five year old daughter ask us why was that star was flashing up in the sky. When we looked at what she was talking about at first we thought it was an airplane and then realized it wasn’t so we pull over into a parking lot.  When we were watching this craft is was circular and had different lights flashing from it.  The colors were red, blue, green and white.  It also had an aura around it.  We watch it for about an hour.  It just kept on floating from left to right and up and down.  Also coming closer to us then fading back away.  Then all of a sudden my husband decided to look directly up to see if there was anything else in the sky.  We saw these small circular objects moving so fast through the sky, moving left to right and diagonally.  One of the objects went directly towards an airplane it looked like it was going to hit it.  We think the first craft we saw might have been commutating with the little crafts.  During this sighting my husband had called his mother and his brother to tell them to look in the sky toward the east to see if they can see what we were seeing.   After a few minutes his brother saw it and then so did his mother.  His brother also saw the little crafts going toward the airplane and zipping back and forth in the sky.  We were all amazed at what we were seeing, it was very weird.  This was my first sighting of a UFO, this was my husband’s second sighting.  It all seem too weird to be true but it was since his family seen it too and they were on the other side of the town.  Well needless to say that it was our daughters’ first UFO sighting, she was really scared and kept her eyes closed and said can we just get to the store already.

It was a pretty chilly and breezy fall Sunday night but we wanted to look at the stars since we had just moved recently and were excited to view the night sky since it was so clear out.  Within just a few minutes an unusual traveling bright circular bluish white light caught our attention at an instant.  At first I thought it was a shooting star, but then it appeared to be moving closer towards us and not disappearing we knew such to be.  We watched it travel closer towards us for about a minute staring in amazement, disbelief and even a little fear that it may be an asteroid or bomb. We watched it get closer and brighter for about 30 seconds, moving further east then remain quite stationary for about 3 seconds when it was at its brightest before vanishing into the eastern night sky at a rapid but steady gliding speed for about 6 seconds until it totally disappeared.  It seemed to have come into our atmosphere from space, descend and then leave a different direction. I noticed an orbiting satellite and airplanes in flight and compared how different the light and motion of travel was in every way just to rule out things from our planet that travel regularly.  We had cancelled out everything and both believed we had encountered an UFO. I was convinced within 5 seconds that it could possibly be an UFO because of a prior experience.  While walking my dog a few years ago with my husband I noticed a black triangular object in the sky just before dusk thinking it was a bird at first until it just kept descending and appearing more like the size of a helicopter. and then within a few blinks of an eye went back up into the sky faster than I’ve ever seen anything move that distance.  What I saw in both experiences are almost exactly the same as far as the flight pattern and vanishing so fast.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271

Slow moving craft I-69 and DuPont road.;2014-09-16 00:00:00;2 minutes;Slow moving craft I-69 and DuPont road. I witnessed the same thing that another reported on 09/16.  It was so low and so bright I thought it was a hoax.  But I can't get it out of my mind.  Just like previously reported it was right above 69 and DuPont.  And right above my apartment complex.   If anyone else seen it please say so.thanks.  I swear I'm totally real.  Still kind of freaked out.   It was right above my head at times about 500 feet above me and made absolutely no noise and the lights kept turning on and off.   When the lights were off you could see a single whit light at the center of the craft. It was probably 50 feet wide;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271

It appeared to be larger then at least 2 airplanes.   The sun was just about to rise there was a red glow in the sky.  As I reached for my cell phone to take a picture, the objects lights dimmed and the object slowly moved east and was soon out of sight with the speed of light!
