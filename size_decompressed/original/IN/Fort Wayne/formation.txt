Sunday Nov. 5th at 16:45  at Rockhill park in Fort Wayne,IN, I and my 3 granddaughters ages 8,6,3 observed what we first thought were hot air ballons, but as they moved closer toward the park it was obvious they wern't balloons. There were three triangular shaped, silverish-white objects with black bottoms. Each triangle was accompanied by serveral silver spheres. They bobbed slowly and noiselessly descending toward the park, but only close enough to make out the shapes and colors of the objects. We watched as two of the trianles flanked by several of the silver spheres moved to the left of us while the third triangle and its spheres moved around to the right of us. We watched them for approx. 10 minutes before they just disappeared without a trace. They made no noise or smoke. It was a clear day no clouds in the sky about 2 hours before sunset. It was awesome. I contacted the Fort Wayne Police Department,they had not received  any other reports.   I'm a 46 year old married female,with over 20 yrs. of experience in electronics assembly and repair in the defense industry.I'm a high school graduate with some college course work. ((NUFORC Note:  We talked to this witness at length, and we found her to be quite credible and convincing.  Her written report and illustration are quite interesting.  We will attempt to post her illustration.  PD));41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
Multiple sightings of fast moving points of light with changing motion, no identifiable shape, sudden appearances and disappearances.;2009-07-01 00:00:00;several weeks;Multiple sightings of fast moving points of light with changing motion, no identifiable shape, sudden appearances and disappearances. Multiple sightings of unidentified objects have occurred in the past few weeks over Fort Wayne, Indiana. Sightings have been made by myself and 5 other people.  I have experience in astronomy, astrology, and physics, as do two other witnesses.  REPORT:  On clear nights the unknown objects have been seen flying across the sky as (apparently) tiny points of light--NOT BLINKING, with a constant glow--, about the size/brightness of an average star (from our perspective). At first we assumed they were planes or possibly satellites, but for how small they were--seeing as they were at extremely high altitudes--they were moving far too fast.  The objects moved at a seemingly constant velocity, but their independent trajectories are  not constant.  We have seen them travel in straight paths, in exaggerated arcs, and even move back in forth in a kind of weaving motion. What is peculiar is that the objects do not appear off the horizon, they simply appear at random points in the sky, sometimes along with barely noticeable flashes of light.  Some are stationary and then begin to move very suddenly with no detectable acceleration.  Furthermore, the objects do not necessarily fly toward the horizon as they move away from us.  Instead they either fade away or simply blip out of sight.  We assume that this means they are not following the curve of the earth, but moving on some kind of tangent.  One object was the most interesting.  It was much lower in the atmosphere then the others, appearing very large and bright, but with no obvious shape.  It was just a point of light.  It moved very quickly across the sky, and disappeared in a very sudden and almost undetectable flash of light.  It was nowhere near the horizon at the time of its disappearance.  The color of light coming from the larger object seemed to be a yellow shade, the wavelength being around 580nm. The most recent sighting was witnessed by myself alone at approximately 4:15 am, Wednesday, July 15 2009.  There was a small flash and then a poi! nt of li ght like others before.  This time, though,as the object moved directly over my position, the amplitude of the light it emitted greatly increased until it was very very bright.  It dimmed again, then brightened for a shorter amount of time, before quickly speeding up and simply disappearing at about 75 degrees off the horizon. ** I realize this report is not very well organized, but it is in all aspects completely serious.  I would very sincerely appreciate if someone were to look into this case. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Multiple balls of light in the sky that constantly changed position for 15 minutes plus;2011-11-14 21:00:00;15 minutes;Multiple balls of light in the sky that constantly changed position for 15 minutes plus I was looking out the window of my two story house towards an empty field.  Today, the field that I was looking at has become an addition.  There is a large water tower that abuts the addition I live in.  Off in the distance, beyond the water tower, were over five glowing balls of light in the sky.  Airplanes usually pass over this area, as there is an airport that is off to one direction, but these did not behave like aircraft.  In fact, they moved constantly for about 15 minutes, weaving and ducking in the sky.  At one point, they almost made a triangular shape.  Then, in one instant, they moved away, so quickly, that it could not have been an airplane.  It was like a rocket, and they all took off at once, every single ball of light, as if it was coming from one craft. I didn't see any aircraft chasing the object, but I have been puzzled thinking about it ever since it had happened.  Usually, I'm not one to believe in this kind of stuff.  When I saw what I saw though, I instantly believed.  I have never seen anything like it before in my life.

3 balls of spherical lights almost landing.;2014-04-27 18:20:00;10 seconds;3 balls of spherical lights almost landing. I was headed back home with my mom and her boyfriend and my little brother.  We started to hear a faint noise almost like a scratching chalkboard or something similar to that.  We looked up at the sky and we saw what it looked like 3 balls of yellowish white balls in triangular formation.  I thought it was a plane because they were close to each other. but then it separated and it was going down like it was landing. but then the noise stopped and the lights dissappeared.   I never got the chance to take pictures because my phone and my moms phone was low battery when it was half full. I do remember what they look like though.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271

The lights slowed and stayed in one spot low in the sky then slowly moved south again where a fourth light became visible.  Then it was gone.   Definitely not an airplane.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
