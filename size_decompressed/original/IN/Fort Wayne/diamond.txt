Bright light, hovering, close to ground, about the size of a car.;2012-12-04 22:00:00;4 minutes;Bright light, hovering, close to ground, about the size of a car I was driving home on the east side of town, down state st, and I looked up and saw a bright light in the sky a ways down the road.  It was like a single headlight was shining toward me. I turned right down coliseum and as I drove the object followed to the left of me.  I must have seen it from a different angle then because the bright light was gone and instead there were two white lights and a blinking red one in the middle.  At first I thought it was a helicopter but then when I stopped at the light so did it. It was the strangest thing. I pulled into the nearby parking lot and sort of followed it.  It hovered a while and then sank down behind a hill.  I could see the outline of a sort of 3d diamond shape though.  I've never seen anything like this before.  But I did see a lady next to me watching it too so at least I know I'm not crazy right (:;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
