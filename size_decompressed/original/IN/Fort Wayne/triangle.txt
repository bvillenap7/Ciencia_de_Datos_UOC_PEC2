Triangle object spotted 8-31-04 in Indiana!;2004-08-31 21:15:00;2 minutes;Triangle object spotted 8-31-04 in Indiana! Well, I go to school in ft. wayne indiana, Im a senior at Indiana Tech University there. Anyways, I drive about an hour to school, so I was driving home on state rd. 30 towards warsaw indiana. About 9:15-9:20 I saw an object while driving. At first, I didnt really pay any attention to it, but then I noticed it looked funny. It was hovering over some trees off to the right of the highway, then as I came up upon it, it darted over the highway into the field off to my left. As I drove up, I put my window down to see if I could hear anything such as rotor blades if it was a helicopter or engines if it was a plane. But, nothing! The object was triangular in shape, a white/blue light on each end of the triangle, and in the middle, it had a red light, that flashed white around it, almost like a strobe light. I had pulled off to the side of the road like an idiot, but I wanted to know exactly what I was looking at! Not to much traffic either on the highway that night, so it was pretty quiet outside! Very strange to say the least, hopefully someone else near and around ft. wayne saw this object as well! 2nd time in as many months that Ive seen a strange object around ft. wayne, this is the first time Ive reported one though!;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
triangle shaped UFO with a light on each end;2005-06-09 21:00:00;10 seconds;triangle shaped UFO with a light on each end It was the scariest thing I saw that night. It was a triangle. It had a white light on one corner, a blue light at another corner and a red one at the third corner. The white light was flashing. It move very quickly across the Eastern sky. It went from South to North and then disappeared. I was looking through binoculars.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
Triangle shape with low glow seen for about 15 seconds;2005-09-01 20:15:00;15 seconds;Triangle shape with low glow seen for about 15 seconds Me and my wife were outside sitting in lawn chairs in the drive way near the house. I had just looked up and noticed a triangle shape off to about my 10 oclock.  I then pointed it out to my wife and saw right away. We both watched it go into the distance till we could no longer see it.  It had the width of a medium size prop plane. On all three corners where circles that had a light glow and went around the edges. There were no bright lights about it. The only outline was from street lights from across the street.  It had the speed of a lear jet and figured it was a plane that had no becon light because there is a small airstrip about 2 miles from our home.  That is when we realized there was no noise of a prop or jet. Because of darkness it was hard to tell how far up it was but by best guest about 1000 feet.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
Dark Triangular shaped 1 blue/white light aft of center of ship;2007-02-09 04:45:00;7 minutes;Dark Triangular shaped 1 blue/white light aft of center of ship Feb. 9, 2007 @ 0445, I69 North, Ft. Wayne IN  I travel the same route at the same time everyday and have for the last 7 years.  Have never seen anything out of the ordinary until this morning.  I always watch the stars and know the constellations, as they are the same everyday.  This morning I noticed a blue-white light in the sky, similar to an LED type light.  This light did not appear to move in any direction and was not a star, planet, helicopter or airplane.  I noticed that the stars that should have been in that part of the sky were no longer visible because something was blocking them out.   As I approached Ft. Wayne, the light appeared brighter but still wasnâ€™t moving.  I pulled over to the side of the road and came to a complete stop.  When I got out of my truck to observe the object in the sky, it blended in nearly perfectly with the night sky but was one or two shades darker.  The blue-white light was near the rear of the craft on the belly.  The light was round in shape with conical shaped protrusion coming off the bottom.  The light was bright but you could see through it enough to identify the structure emitting the light.  The light was not in the shape of a beam or floodlight but rather was more iridescent.  All the edges of the craft distorted the night sky similar to the heat you see shimmering off of a hot blacktop road surface.  The object was triangular in shape but turned on its side, resembling a wedge, with the point facing northwest.  It was moving at an extremely slow rate.  There was no sound.  There were no other distinguishing features to describe. I had to continue on my way turning northwest with the object it remained constant in the sky until I headed south and lost site of it. I called 911 in Ft. Wayne (Allen Co.) and reported the object and was told that there had been several other reports of the same thing.  The dispatcher that took my information was very dismissive. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  However, we believe that this report was submitted by the gentleman with whom we spoke via telephone.  He sounded exceptionally sober-minded, in our opinion, and we suspect that he may be a highly reliable witness.  We have spoken with the Allen County Sheriff's Office, and we are awaiting a response from that office, regarding the possibility of other reports.  PD));41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271

On 06/13/2013, me my brother and my sons mother pulled up to the night club (note that we haven't been drinking yet) and as soon as we parked I happened to look up out of the windshield of the car and I notice a plane go by and a strange triangle shape object with a light at each point of the triangle going in a forward motion and when I asked the two people in the car do they see the ufo( who then looked up an noticed the ufo) it stopped its forward motion in mid stride and reversed and disappeared behind a tall enough building to were we weren't able to see it anymore...;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
3 lights in the shape of a triangle hover and then travel S, SW.;2014-01-29 21:00:00;1 minute;3 lights in the shape of a triangle hover and then travel S, SW. While looking out the window, my two children(ages 13 and 15) spotted a stationary object with three lights in the form of a triangle.  It was about 45 min after we spotted lights in the sky while driving home.  I also saw this object, and it appeared to be traveling at a very slow rate, going South-South West.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
walked outside to see a craft i couldnt believe, even as i was staring at it trying to find reason to dismiss it.;2015-03-31 21:30:00;30 second;walked outside to see a craft i couldnt believe, even as i was staring at it trying to find reason to dismiss it. i was leaving my house at around 9:30pm to run to arbys to get some dinner, as i walked out i noticed how clear the sky was and looked towards orion since it is always in view and beautiful on a clear night from my front yard. as i looked at orion i seen a airplane flying in front of it. now here is the strange part, as i turned my head towards the southeast to scan the sky, i seen a triangle craft with 4 large lights, almost taking up the whole bottom of the plane, gliding across the sky. almost directly overhead. after i caught view of the craft my mouth dropped and i turned away. having seen this same thing as a child i always wondered if i was just tired as a kid and imagined something. when i turned back to the craft it was to my surprise that it was still there. it continued completely silently arcoss the sky until i lost view of it behind a tree and the horizon. now i feel pretty fortunate because this was a long enough event that i was able to process some of it while it was happening. initially my mind said wow that is a unique craft, maybe the local air guard base is trying out some new toys, or there is a stealth mission flying overhead as neither of these event are uncommon. and i try to be skeptical, maybe to a fault. after i thought of this i strained to focus on the craft, it was then i noticed that the craft had a triangle shape fuselage for lack of a better word. coming off of this fuselage were wings, coming off the rear of the craft extending the overall triangle shape of the craft. it is hard to describe through text, but it was like a large triangle with the bottom third missing except for strips along the edges. there was two large lights on the fuselage taking up the majority of the frame, while the wings or tails, had two lights about half the size, again taking up the majority of the frame of the craft. they were a dim yellow, constant, and i can think of no purpose for them, they were not indication lights, unless it was to indicate to someone below the craft. the movement of the craft was completely silent. when i was trying to figure out what it was i paused a moment and tried to listen to anything that might be a jet engine.only to hear nothing of the sort, just normal city noise. now the size of the craft is something that confuses me. I hesitate to offer an estimation as i have no real source for my comparison except everyday life. to me it looked  the size of a jetliner maybe 1-5000 feet up.  a comparison for me would be a jetliner taking off and being maybe 30-45second into flight. not that ive seen that exact scenario, but that is the estimation i can give. It looked huge, i could see the edges, i could make the outline, but it appeared as though it was shrouded by clouds. it could be that the craft was huge and flying in the clouds, but there is no way any craft ive seen would look that big being up in the clouds. if this craft was up in the clouds, i couldnt even give you an estimate as to size. i have no comparison, simple as that. if the craft were closer to ground, the size would seem more plausible,barely.  still the shape and silence of the craft wouldn't. but none the less, closer to the ground brings the issue of why was it shrouded by clouds. i wont deny that i have had a fascination with UFOs, airplanes, spacecraft, science in general. which makes this experience even more shaking. I frequent nasa's page, i play computer games where you build aircraft, ive always had a passion for aviation. i COULD NOT explain what i was looking at. even while i was looking at it, trying to think of possible critiques and explanations.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271

Then it sped up and was gone in a blink of an eye. I tried to take pictures but they did not turn out very well.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
