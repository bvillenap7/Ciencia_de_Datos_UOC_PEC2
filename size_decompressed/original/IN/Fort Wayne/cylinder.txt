Crystal clear view of object-very mechanical and unimaginably fast.;1980-09-15 21:00:00;1 minute;Crystal clear view of object-very mechanical and unimaginably fast. WHILE WATCHING TV, MY BROTHER SITTING BY THE WINDOW JUMPED UP QUICKLY AND LOOKED OUT THE WIDOW IN DISBELIEF. HE SAID, EXCITEDLY, THAT HE NOTICED A BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE LARGE BEAN FIELD SITUATED BEHIND OUR HOME. HE SAID THAT HE SAW IT RISE SLIGHTLY AND THEN COME TOWARD OUR HOUSE AT AN INCREDIBLE SPEED AND THAT IT WAS WELL LIT. HE THEN SAID THAT IT SEEMED TO FLY OVER OUR HOUSE. CURIOUS, I LEAD HIM OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF WE COULD GET A GLIMPSE OF IT COMING OVER OUR HOUSE. THE SKY WAS CRYSTAL CLEAR AND I SAW NOTHING--I THOUGH MAYBE HE HAD WITNESSED A HELICOPTER RISE OUT OF THE FIELD. SUDDENLY, WHEN LOOKING BACK TOWARD THE HOUSE WE BOTH WITNESSED ANOTHER CRAFT, CYLINDRICALLY SHAPED WITH LIGHTS ON IT COME FLYING UP OVER OUR HOME FROM THE SAME DIRECTION (THE REAR OF OUR HOUSE). I ESTIMATE THAT THE VEHICLE WAS APPROX. 1 TO  2 MILES HIGH AND A BIT LARGER THAN A CITY BUS. I DO NOT KNOW IF IT WAS ANOTHER CRAFT OR THE SAME ONE CIRCLING AROUND OR SOMETHING.  I CAN TELL YOU THIS-IT FLEW SO QUICKLY TO A POINT ABOVE OUR HOUSE THAT IT WAS MIND BOGGLING-IT LEFT A LIGHT TRAIL AND AMAZINGLY STOPPED, I MEAN LIKE, INSTANIOUSLY--SO QUICKLY THAT YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE OCCUPANTS WOULD HAVE BEEN THROWN THROUGH THE WINDOW. IT HOVERED ABOVE US FOR A FEW MOMENTS, AS IF IT WERE OBSERVING US AND THEN IT ARCHED UPWARD THE RIGHT OF THE MOON AND FLEW AWAY AT A SPEED UNIMAGINABLE. LITERALLY THE SPEED OF LIGHT. WE WATCHED IT TWINKLE OUT OF SIGHT IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE. ASTOUNDED WE CALLED THE LOCAL POLICE, WHO INSTEAD OF TREATING US AS PRANKSTERS, ASKED US TO WAIT UNTIL THEY RETRIEVED THE PROPER FORM (YES, THEY HAD A FORM FOR UFO ENCOUNTERS). THE POLICE SAID THAT THEY GET MANY CALLS AND DOCUMENT THEM ALL. I SWEAR TO ALL WHO READ THIS THAT IT IS TRUE AND THAT HAD YOU WITNESSED THIS AS CLEARLY AS WE DID YOU WOULD BE FASCINATED.

Young couple were outside at his home, and the young lady saw a light in the sky that caught her eye..  She asked her boyfriend to look up and check it out..  It was a cigar shaped object with white lights on both ends. and was moving from the SW to the NE at a moderate speed.  They first thought it was a passenger jet, but this object had no wings and was totally silent.  This was the first sighting.  A few minutes later, another cigar shaped object was observed following the same flight path but with yellow lights on both ends.  The first one was fluorescent with a dark circle in the center.
