An object that was just above the trees, hovering and taking off in a split second, out of sight.;1988-07-14 01:00:00;10 minutes;An object that was just above the trees, hovering and taking off in a split second, out of sight. My husband and I were talking one night, and I saw a bright light out of my window, looked out and there it was, hovering over the trees.  I could see it had an almost octagon shape and there were lights surrounding the craft. We were both stunned, just staring at waiting for it to do something. Before we knew it, it went straight up out of sight.  We kept staring out the window in disbelief, then all of a sudden it came back just as quickly as it left. It didn't make any noise that we could hear, but it continued to leave and come back five times. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

There were 7-9 slow moving yellow solid moving objects over my neighborhood.;1999-06-15 15:00:00;10 secs;There were 7-9 slow moving yellow solid moving objects over my neighborhood. My sister and I were watching TV in my grandma's basement. For some reason my sister was looking out the window and I had this feeling that there was something startling that she was looking at out the windows.   So I went up to the window and there were 7 to 9 solid yellow slow moving objects moving about 10-15 m.p.h. over the field next to my grandma's house.  We did not have the TV sound very high and there was not any noise what so ever coming from the objects.   As the approached a main road they disappeared in a matter of a second as if they had some sort of a cloaking ability or went into another dimension.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
Seen from I-69 between Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, Indiana.  Object had strobing lights that seemed to circle around it.;2000-04-04 02:00:00;~5 minutes;Seen from I-69 between Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, Indiana.  Object had strobing lights that seemed to circle around it. The object moved from east to west in the sky.  It seemed odd because it was a cloudy night and I hadn't seen any planes because the clouds were low.  I could make it out as a circular object because the white strobing lights on it seemed to go around the object continuously.  About 5 or so of the lights in a row seemed to go from left to right on the object, then dissapear and reappear on the left, seeming as if the lights went around the perimeter of the object.  Besides the 5 or so white strobing lights, there were also a few stationary lights in the colors of red, green, and blue that also flashed but not nearly as fast as the white strobes.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
Giant UFO seen up close;2001-08-12 00:00:00;15 minutes;Giant UFO seen up close I was picking up my girlfriend from Meijer off of U.S. 37, we were at the intersection of U.S. 37 and the road to Meijer. It was really foggy and directly across from us was a light pole, that was in front of a very large clearing between two forests. We were stopped waiting for the light to turn green for our turn to go. My girlfriend and I were in my 1981 RS Camaro. The light finally turned green and I began slowly turning left to go down U.S. 37.  About half-way through I noticed the fog behind the light pole beginning to seperate and the crest of the UFO appear. I immidiately stopped and watched. Subsequently everyone else 4 other cars I noticed also stopped. The object emerged through the fog and the light of the light pole shined on it. It was colored like coal, black but shiney. It had alot of contouring, similar to that of the UFOs in the movie Independance Day.  At first the nose of it (assuming the nose) was pointing down and it looked like it was about to crash into the ground. Maybe a few feet from the ground, it then began to slow down and pull up. Almost like a computer in slow-motion. After which, It just hung there and didn't move.  It was very very big, from what I could see sticking out of the fog, it had to be as wide as the clearing itself. At this time their is now a Super Wal-Mart in that very same clearing to give you an idea on its size. The object made no sound at all, except for the sound of the air rumbling around it. And their were no lights of any kind that I could observe. It was probably 80-90 ft in front of us, about 20ft from the ground.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271

oval or disc-like shaped metallic object that was moving faster than a plane horizontally across the sky;2010-09-16 15:00:00;less than a minute;Thursday September 16, 2010 at approximately 3:00 p.m., I was driving north on Broadway with my 13 year old daughter in the front passenger seat.  She was gazing out the window when she suddenly shouted, “What’s that?!” and “Look!”  She kept pointing east and up beyond what I could see from the driver’s side of the car.  She described what she saw as an oval or disc-like shaped metallic object that was moving faster than a plane horizontally across the sky before it accelerated and shot off in a vertical motion and disappeared.  The sky at the time was clear with few clouds.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
Fort Wayne - 10 second sighting of Slow Medium Oval Object - 1:22am September 10th 2012;2012-09-10 01:22:00;10 seconds;Fort Wayne - 10 second sighting of Slow Medium Oval Object - 1:22am September 10th 2012 Spotted a medium sized object (approximately 5x larger than aicraft at 10k altitude).  It was white/yellow oval light with no sound.  Spotted through large window in living room, and caught eye because of size and slow speed.  Object was moving from SSE to NNW. Object quickly slowed down from faster rate of speed.  I went outside in time to see object come to a near complete stop and then its lights turned off.  No sound or lights after spotting.  Clear sky with good star visibility. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
Fast, silent, squadrons of oval shaped almost transparent objects flying at night;2013-07-12 23:15:00;>30 seconds;Fast, silent, squadrons of oval shaped almost transparent objects flying at night We (my wife, in-laws, and me) were located off of Union Chapel Rd near Leo, IN at approximately 11:15 pm July 12, 2013.   There were four of us this evening star gazing around a small camp fire.  We spotted objects in the air flying out of the east horizon.  They moved strongly west (slightly southwest) at speeds consistent with incredibly fast/low flying fighter jets which we have at our local air base in Fort Wayne, IN.  They flew almost directly above us but slightly to the south of our vantage point.   There were objects (at least three dozen or so) which appeared to be circular in nature but more oval shaped (similar to the body of a jellyfish).  There were no sounds at all or any beacon type lighting.  They blended in with the sky very well but seemed illuminated by the ground lights of the city/suburbs near us.   The moon was not visible to us for any comparison but they were much bigger than any stars (about the size of a quarter or fifty cent piece hel! d at arms-distance).  When we first noticed them, they came in “squadrons” of about three in a seeming v-type formation.   There were several of these and were followed last by a very large clustering with no definite formation other than being in a large group.  They were all flying at speeds consistent with each other and very close together, not breaking from their location in relation to their set patterns and the other objects.   They seemed to be headed for a specific location and quickly.  It is a cloudless, very calm evening with virtually no distinct wind at ground level.  Our ground elevation is 826’.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
I saw my first UFO!  White light with red lights on bottom pulsating!;2015-04-12 20:00:00;5 minutes;I saw my first UFO!  White light with red lights on bottom pulsating! Walking my Shih Tzu around pond I noticed a light in the sky with some blinking red heading north east.   I thought it was just a plane until it cut sharp to the right and then down and then to the left.  The only shape I could make out was round or oval.  As I got almost around the pond it reappeared and was to the north of me.   The thing had like a heart beat as it pulsed.  I was so shocked I couldn't take my eyes off it.   It was high up above houses before it went up into cloud coverage.   I did get two videos but it's very hard to see as it looks like a dot in them.  I used my iPhone. I will say I saw my 1st real UFO!!;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
