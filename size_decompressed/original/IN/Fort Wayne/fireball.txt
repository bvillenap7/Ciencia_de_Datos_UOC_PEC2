On 11/16/99, my 4-year-old son and I were driving north on US 27 from Decatur, IN to Fort Wayne for an amateur radio club meeting. It was about 19:05, and we had crossed over the Adams-Allen county line about 4 miles ago. I had heard about the meteor shower expected to start that night, so I'm trying to look at the sky frequently. About that time, I noticed a bright green light about 10-15 degrees above the horizon, at about my 10 o'clock position. From the angle that US 27 runs, this would have been about due west of me. I thought it was too low to be a meteor, but kept glancing at it, thinking it was probably an airplane. After a few seconds, I could start to see a short, green tail below and to the left. This got my interest, so I kept watching it. It appeared to be moving in our general direction, because it was getting higher in the sky and I could see more of the tail. Thinking this was going to be one spectacular meteor, I slowed down and pulled the car over. By this time, we had been watching the fireball for about 30 seconds, and it was now so high in the sky that I had to lean forward against the steering wheel and look almost straight up to see it. The tail was bright green, and took up a good 30 degrees of arc. It wasn't nearly as bright as the fireball, which was an intense white-green light, but it was bright enough to be easily seen. The tail was also as wide as the fireball, and had a cluster of about 5 bright greenish-white points of light in it, immediately behind the fireball. Trailing farther back in the tail were about 3 more lights, not grouped together. All of these were about the same color, and were bright enough to be easily seen in the tail, but the fireball was by far the brightest. I was stunned enough by what I was seeing that I didn't pay as much attention to some of the details as I should have. For example, the exact number lights in the tail, their motion relative to the fireball and each other, the exact time or duration, or the exact spot I pulled over at. I had n! ever see n anything like this, and kept thinking that it was moving awfully slow for a meteor. We sat and watched, discussing what we were seeing, while it moved farther down the sky toward my 4 o'clock position, or about due east of me. As it got closer to the horizon, I noticed a gradual color change from the intense green-white to an orange color. Also, the fireball and tail were much dimmer and hard to see now. The trailing lights were all we could see as they became dimmer and darker orange, until I lost sight of them about 10-15 degrees above the horizon. I wasn't sure if the change in color and intensity were due to the meteor burning out, or if I was simply looking through too much atmosphere to see it well. From start to finish, I estimate the whole event took around a minute, maybe a minute and 15 seconds. My son saw most of this also, and was able to describe it in good detail to my wife later that night. Some background on myself: I'm 35, a metrology technician for a major telecommunications company, and a ham radio operator.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271

I was amazed of the brightness of the object since I had never seen any meteorite like it before. It was at approxitmatly 45 deg. when I first noticed it going in a due east direction. The object was a very bright green. It appeared to be at 3000 feet altitude so I turned around the block expecting to see it hit the ground. As I was going in the opposte direction it fragmented into maybe 6 or 7 smaller pieces. It fizzled out behind a 40-story building as I was about 3/4 miles from that building. Fort Wayne doesn't have many tall buildings so I had a clear view of the object until it ended. I'm not sure if it made a noise or not when it passed. Duration of time visually was between 1-2 min. I'm sure there was others who saw it since I was driving on a 4 lane(one way) street in middle of town.I work as a Maintenance Technician at a Country Club and see things as they are but this is uexplainable to me.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271

We were walking home and as we looked up into the air, we saw fireworks. However one spark didin't fade away from the rest, it kept moving horizontally. It kept moving like an airplane, but it was bright orange and looked like it was flaming. one of us went to get a camera but it flew away extremely fast like it went into hyperspeed or something. we managed to get two very blurry pictures of it that we are trying to clean up right now.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
2 wierd objects appeared in sky- floating and disappeared into city skylights with in 1 min of each other.;2008-07-04 23:35:00;30 sec;2 wierd objects appeared in sky- floating and disappeared into city skylights with in 1 min of each other. We were watching the fireworks and just hanging out after when he said what's that?  We watched the object move across the skyline and first thought it was a firework.   After several seconds of continued orange-yellow color, the object seems to be moving/float at a steady speed seemingly closer to us.  There was no sound of an airplane or medical helicopter.   We watched as it floated across the sky almost 180 degrees in a arch. IT was NOT a firework- it was slower then that!  We watched this until it disappeared into the city lights.  A few moments later, a second object identical or very close to it, appeared at the same place we saw the first one appear.   The same sequence of events took place, same route, same speed, same wierd glow of color.  Again, this object disappeared into the lights above the city.   The sky was clear- the smoke from the fireworks had cleared.  We also noticed with both objects they seemed to almost...wiggle back and forth while glided/floating through the sky.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271

The faded out in the clear sky On Saturday, 09-08-12 at 21:15 hours, family and friends were sitting outback on the patio talking.  The five of us were enjoying the clear evening.  The sky was full with bright stars and no clouds were seen during this time.  I noticed a triangular formation of four bright orange lights traveling from the North to the South of the Fort Wayne Area.  Then we noticed one single orange light actually leading the formation and then two following the formation from the rear.  The lights appeared to be moving at a continuas speed with the four in the triangular formation staying in a perfect formation.  The first ofject, after watching all of them travel past us with absolutly no noise, faded out and was never seen again.  The four in the formation then began to fade out in the same area as the one.  The two from the rear also faded out at what appeared to the be the same area of the sky that the previous five disappeared!  The large orange fireball style of ligh! ting was very bright, moving at a constant speed but made no sound.  There was no strange activity prior to or after the observation of these lights.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
Glowing object in sky,;2013-08-21 21:15:00;10 minutes;Glowing object in sky, My daughter and I stepped out of our truck as I noticed a glowing object flying across the sky.  The object appeared to be flying from the S/W and slightly turned to a north direction. No sound, no blinking lights, appeared to be at a high altitude could not make out any type of shape.  Object seemed to get brighter to dim over a 10-20 second time period and kept repeating this.   We watched this for about 7-10 min until it seemed to disappear.  Cell phone acted really weird afterwards.  I took photos of said object!;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
