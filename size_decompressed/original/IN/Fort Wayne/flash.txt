Bright white flashes by the Radio and TV towers in Fort Wayne, Indiana;2004-10-16 19:00:00;1 minute;Bright white flashes by the Radio and TV towers in Fort Wayne, Indiana Near the group of radio and TV towers there was an awesome flash of white light.  My buddy and I were driving West on Union Chapel Road and saw that amazingly bright flash.  We saw the flash perhaps 20 times and then it quit.  It looked like it was near the towers with all the red lights.  But this flash was 10 times more bright than any of the red lights.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
