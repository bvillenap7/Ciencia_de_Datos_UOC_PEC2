Dark gray colored object with two big circles on the side;2000-09-16 17:54:00;15 secs;Dark gray colored object with two big circles on the side I was out fishing with my two younger brother-in-laws when they were looking up in the sky and saw a jet liner fly overhead and asked me what the trails were coming out from behind it were and I told them that they were from the water in the jet fuel turning to vapor and reacting with the cold air like cars do in winter.  They said it wasnt cold out so why were they showing up?  I told them the higher you go the colder it gets.  That is ho you can tell if a jet is real high or if it is low.  We then saw a smaller crat (UFO) that appeared to be higher than the jet.  The jet was flying west and the smaller craft was heading north and it crossed behind the jet.  I thought it was kind of weird for a small plane to be that high and continued to watch it.  I was steering the boat we were on and turned to make sure we werent going to hit anything and turned around and looked to continue to watch it and didnt see it anywhere.  The craft wasn't flying mach 1 or anything like that so it couldn't have flown out of sight.  The jet was still visible but yet the other object had seemed to just disappear.  The object was dark gray in color, cigar shaped, and it looked like it had two big circles on the side.  There was no contrail behind it.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271

It went over head and then went off into the distance. We were able to capture video and photographed as well. ((nuforc Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he corrected the time.  He stated that he will send the video clips that they caught of the object.  PD));41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
Cigar-shaped objects with the orange flame in the front flying in a grid pattern.;2016-07-04 22:19:00;>1 hour (for all 5);cigar shaped objects with the orange flame in the front flying in a grid pattern. myself and my daughter saw the light come up over the trees to the south west. she had her phone and I got mine and started filming. it flew to the northeast. it did not take long to get behind the trees. I asked het to take photos with her I phone,  since I was having trouble getting a clear image on my phone. we set and talked about it for 10 minutes then we saw another one on the same path but it appeared to be closer.  she went back inside then 10 minutes later I saw another one to the northwest heading to the southeast.  I tried to film it but the camera was having a hard time picking it up. after it past over the horizon I sat back down.  then about 10 minutes later a saw another one on the same path but farther away.  I watched it disappear and then sat back down. 10 minutes later a saw another one on the same path as the previous 2.  it was so far off that I could not get it on my phone. they looked cigar shaped. the thing that made them stand out is that it looked like a rocket flying backwards. the flame was in the front of the unit. I had seen the same thing the day before it came into view from the southwest then it made a 180 degree turn and shot off to the south very fast.;41.1110040072861;-85.1470779599271
