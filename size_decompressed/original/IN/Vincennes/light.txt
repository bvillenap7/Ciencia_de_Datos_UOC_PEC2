8 large bright pale orange lights were seen above treeline on and off for about 10 minutes.;2004-02-18 20:30:00;10 minutes;8 large bright pale orange lights were seen above treeline on and off for about 10 minutes. On Wednesday Feb. 18,2004 My Wife and My Brother were sitting out in our hottub on the back deck of our house.  The night was a very clear one.  Many Many stars were out to look at.  We live on the outskirts of our town, so lights from the town are at a minimum.  My Brother was the first to see the bright object.  He said that out to the west above a tree line he seen a 3 bright pale orange light appear. They were about a quarter of the size of a full moon, but not nearly as bright.  They appeared for 2 seconds at a 45 degree angle going from bottom left to top right.  Then it just blinked out.  By that time he all ready told me and my wife.  We started looking in the general location and in about 2 minutes 3 more bright pale orange lights appeared.  Not all at once but like 1 then 2 then three.  They were also at a 45 degree angle going from bottom left to top right.  They were the same size as the first one and in the same location.  There was about the same size again between the lights.  This lasted for about 10 seconds then those turned off all at once.  About another 2 minutes later another bright pale orange light appeared in the same location and being about the same size.  This one stayed for about 2-3 seconds and then split into 2 bright pale orange lights.  It reminded me of Ronald McDonald doing his letter M with his hands. But of course in a smaller area together.  It even left a sparkling trail when it did its split.  This lasted for 2-3 seconds and then they both turned off.  We waited for another 1/2 hour but there was nothing else in terms of lights.  But there was of course about 3 or 4 Fighter Jets that were circling the same area of the lights just about a minute or two right after the last sighting.  This also happened last week on Thursday and at the same time and location.  Same size bright pale orange light that just appeared and stayed for about 3 seconds then turned off.  They did not look like anything that we have seen before.  They did not look like fireworks or Flares.  These lights were in one position.  They did not float downward like fireworks or flares.  We are very curious to know what we seen.;38.6717;-87.5128000000001
