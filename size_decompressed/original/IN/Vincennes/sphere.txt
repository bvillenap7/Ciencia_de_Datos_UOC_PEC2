The three of us were standing on our balcony smoking a cigarette, we were watching the sky and we saw a sphere of different colored lights hovering at about power line level and about a 1000 yards off.  We continued to watch as it rose higher and shot off from the Northeast to the Southwest.  It seemed to be gone in the blink of an eye.;38.6717;-87.5128000000001
