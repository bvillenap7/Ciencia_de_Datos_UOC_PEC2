3 Light Blue/Gray Orbs in triangle formation flying at low altitude over Vincennes, Indiana;2009-11-11 00:30:00;6 - 10 seconds;3 Light Blue/Gray Orbs in triangle formation flying at low altitude over Vincennes, Indiana I live in Vincennes, Indiana, a small town in Southwest Indiana with a population of 25,000+/- people. On the early morning of 10/11/2009 at about 12:35am I was let my dogs outside to do their thing and stood outside of my house right outside of my front door. It was a cold, dry and clear night and the stars were more visible than I have seen from here, so I gazed up at them. After about 10 – 15 seconds I happened to look straight up above me when it came into view. What I saw were 3 light blue, gray balls of light. Not bright lights, more soft.  It was 300 – 500 feet in the air, and flying in a triangular formation at a very slow, but still “cruising” speed. It was completely silent and headed Southeast. About 2 seconds past and the made a spin move around eachother one time, then went exactly back into the triangle formation.  Then the light blue/gray orbs turned into just light gray and immediately, but very slowly, faded out. I could no longer see the orbs. I let my dogs in and I then had a very strange/ eerie feeling as if someone were watching me, or having a sense of someone in the room. Like the feeling you get when you turn on your TV with the sound off. I was pretty startled and jumped back inside and slammed the door shut and locked it while my arm shook furiously (I was that freaked out). When I sat down to immediately start researching what I had just saw, I still had the strong sense of a presense behind me to the point I feared even turning around. I am glad I have seen one of these ufos, and after much research I have discovered a nearby “ufo hot spot” where people have reported seeing triangular ufos about 12 miles from where I live in a town called Lucky Point. I have also discovered reports of the same ufos 1 week ago 3 hours west of here. For a glimpse of what I saw, please google “STS 115 objects” to see the live NASA TV video of the same triangular orbs. Also google “St. Petersburg Russia triangle ufo” to see a cell phone video of the same orbs and many other people witnessed. Both occurred within the last 2 weeks before my sighting.;38.6717;-87.5128000000001
I witnessed a short-duration, triangle-shaped UFO in Vincennes, IN on Tuesday 01/04/11 at 2:50 a.m.;2011-01-04 02:50:00;3 min.;I witnessed a short-duration, triangle-shaped UFO in Vincennes, IN on Tuesday 01/04/11 at 2:50 a.m. After working nightshift, at approximately 2:50 a.m., on Tuesday, the 4th of January, 2011 I and my riding partner had just returned home, in Vincennes, Indiana, and were walking to the front door of the apartment house where we both live. I was walking slower than him, as I was smoking, and looking up at the stars. I was looking in a SW direction, at a bright star, or pehaps it is Venus or Mercury I do not know, but I turned and looked to the East, at the Big Dipper, and then turned back to look again at the bright star/planet, when to the SSW, at approximately a 30 degree angle, I saw 6 evenly spaced white lights, at angles, approaching in a ENE direction, and then make a sudden banking turn left, or counterclockwise, much like a kite might turn, back towards the SW. I got a full view of the bottom of the object, which was triangle-shaped, without the points, dark with single white lights on either side of the three blunt ends, and a circle of approximately ten to twelve lesser white lights about half way towards the middle. The turn was impossibly tight, silent and very fluid Too tight to be any kind of aircraft I have ever seen, and I have seen many, having spent ten years as a flying crewchief  in the U.S. Air Force, as well as  growing up within a mile of a busy airport. I was able to see the object quite vividly, as it was silouetted in front of a thin white cloud cover, almost like a light fog, moving in from the South, and it actually moved into the clouds, immediately after turning.  I ran to the front door of the apartment house, still trying to watch the object, and called my friend to come back and see it, when someone turned on a fairly powerful spotlight on the ground, approximately SSW of my position, and shined it straight up at the object. The object and spotlight positions could not have been more than a half-mile from where I was standing. By the time my friend got back outside, the object had moved into the clouds sufficiently that it was no longer visible, and the spotlight was turned off, so that my friend saw nothing, unfortunately. We scanned the entire sky, hoping to see the object, or anything else that might be in the area, but saw nothing else. I would like to note that in the month I have been living at my present address, I have not seen any low-flying aircraft, and concluded that there is no airport of any type near this town, but this may not be an accurate accessment. I made a crude drawing of the event, and will attempt to scan it into my laptop, and include it with this written statement.;38.6717;-87.5128000000001
Two triangle shaped craft spotted trailing plane on Christmas eve;2019-12-24 06:15:00;5-10 seconds;Two triangle shaped craft spotted trailing plane on Christmas eve I saw two triangle shaped craft trailing an aircraft.  There were 5 lights in the shape of a triangle along the bottom.  They both made a 45 degree turn and disappeared into clouds;38.6717;-87.5128000000001
