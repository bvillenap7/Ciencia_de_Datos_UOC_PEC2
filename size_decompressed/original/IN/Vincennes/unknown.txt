Low flying silent object with pulsating lights, possibly landing at airport;2010-08-21 22:30:00;3 minutes;Low flying silent object with pulsating lights, possibly landing at airport I was outside looking at Jupiter through our telescope and decided i would go inside to get a drink of water and then come back out, but i as i was walking back to the house i glanced to the west and saw a low flying white blinking light, so i walked fast over to the west side of our yard to get a better look.   The object was probably about two or three miles to the west, and less than a thousand feet above the ground, and moving at around 80 or 100 mph.  There was a white light that was blinking fast, and a red light on the rear that appeared to be moving back and forth, I could not hear any sound at all.  I did not observe this through the telescope because of how fast it was moving, and i should also mention the telescope is very heavy, so it is difficult to move it around.  The object was moving northbound, and as it got about five or six miles to the northwest, it started to decend, and it eventually disappeared behind some trees, possibly landing at the Lawrenceville-Vincennes airport in Illinois, and if so, was probably just an airplane, but the object made no sound at all, so i am not quite for sure what it was.;38.6717;-87.5128000000001
