My wife and I saw it as we were were driving on I-64 heading to I-65. As we were driving by New Albany we noticed a white rectangular object in the distance above the tree-line. It went out of view as the nearer trees blocked the view.  Once a clearing was available again, about a minute of driving later, the object was back in view for perhaps 20 seconds before the view became obstructed again. The view continue to be obstructed the rest of the way. We thought that the object was a banner.  But to us it seemed that the size was too big as this object appeared to be miles away - perhaps 5+ miles.  We did not see a plane pulling it. It woul be worthwhile to determine is a banner was being pupped by a plane.  I'm hoping this can be found quickly. This object only appeared to be two dimensional.  White in color and very symmetrical;38.3084999999994;-85.8160000000004
