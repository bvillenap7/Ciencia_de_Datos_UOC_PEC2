West to east silent flying object which looked to be on fire suddenly stops to hover.;2015-10-16 19:45:00;4 minutes;West to east silent flying object which looked to be on fire suddenly stops to hover. At first, I thought it was a helicopter that was on fire.  The object was moving west to east and moving pretty quick. I was walking my dog and just kept staring at it.  All of a sudden the object just stopped and I was kind of shocked and just kept staring and went inside my house to get my son.  When I came back out the object was gone.  Another strange thing is I heard no engines or noise.  The object looked like it was on fire.;38.3084999999994;-85.8160000000004
