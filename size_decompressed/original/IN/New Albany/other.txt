Moving very slowly though the air. at the front the shape was round and thick, then it had like a narrow neck, about half as wide as the saucer shaped front. It then widened to like a square shape, but with wings, two sets of wings, like an aircraft.But the strange thing was that the front wings were much smaller than the back wings. And instead of faceing the back of the craft they angled to the front. The back wings were at the end of the craft, angled in the same direction.but were much larger than the front wings.  I could see details on the craft, but what I remember most was the what I think was the power jet out put ports????? Thats the only way I can decribe them. maybe 8 2 rows of 4. could see what looked like portholes on the side of the main square main body,it had so much detail, so dark and silnent, .I must of had watched it past over for at least 30 mins. beleive me ornot this was not made in the USA ,and it made a beleiver out of me. SO big so slow ,so silent. If there ever was a mother ship this had to be her sister ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.
