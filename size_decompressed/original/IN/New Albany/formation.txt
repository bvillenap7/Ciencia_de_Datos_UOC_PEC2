Two eventually flew toward the east in a sideways manner (very fast) and the 3rd one streaked downward and then hovered over a tree line - eventually lifted up and we thought possibly towards us, then slowly remained going upward and then away from us until out of sight.   They did not get close enough for us to see any shape, other than 3 round lights - and they may have pulsed very slightly.   My 1st time ever witnessing anything like this!!   Objects may have been too far away to get picture with cell phone...;38.3084999999994;-85.8160000000004
