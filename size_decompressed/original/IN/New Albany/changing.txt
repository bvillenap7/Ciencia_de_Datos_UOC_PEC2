Objects Changed From Oval To FootBall Shape For An Hour;1998-10-15 15:30:00;1 hour;Objects Changed From Oval To FootBall Shape For An Hour 1 silver in color object was seen and observd for 20 minutes moving North to South before it stopped about directly over head and was dead stopped in the air for 5 more minutes before i and 3 other witnesses noticed another object move from and in the same direction as this first object and both were in mid air directly over head and seem to meet there for a specific reason.  They were there for about 5 more minutes before both of them started moving together very slow toward the South. 5 minutes later about 45 degress above the horizon looking south toward the objects 1 started to move toward the West and 1 continued on South a few more minutes and then started heading directly South. We observed the South bound object for 25 more minutes before it was not visable to the naked eye any longer.  The West bound object started to get obscurred by the bright sunshine and was never seen again that we could see after about 3 minutes it headed toward the West. Visability was cear and unlimited and not a breeze of wind to be felt. I did take a look at the objects with magnified eye pieces and thought i would clearly see a high alltitude weather balloon but thiis was not the case.  There appeared to be sorta like shock waves given off by the objects and every second they would go from a oval circle shape to a football shape of form. No aircraft of any kind was seen during this 1 hour period viewing these objects. Louisville Internatioal airport is about 15 miles due south of were we observed these objects and was very busy taking incoming and out going flights till the objects seem to be in the air space of this airport.
