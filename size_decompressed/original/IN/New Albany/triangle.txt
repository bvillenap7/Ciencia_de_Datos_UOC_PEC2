It was a clear night this object blocked out the stars where we were in the country around New Albany, Indiana by Highway 111. The lights were not bright and the object moved slowly without sound. The only movement we noted was the sway of the trees a thousand feet above us on the bluff. This object travelled west across the Ohio River and proceeded towards Ft. Knox, KY. I myself observed the object for one and one half hours, even using my binoculars. Note my father was a loadmaster in the airforce at the local base at that time, and commented to me, Oh, they've had that thing for years and years. this craft has been seen by many other people as well but i do not know what happen to them . i have seen many ufos high in the sky eraly day light hours as well as nite time.

Clear sky, full moon (behind me) three spoke object, blue and white lights, white changed intensity,, soft jet sound;2010-06-26 00:05:00;2 minutes;Clear sky, full moon (behind me) three spoke object, blue and white lights, white changed intensity,, soft jet sound I sighted the object on route 150 just outside of New Albany Ind..  Object was shaped like a three spoke, or Mercedes or peace logo. It had a white light a the end of each spoke and one in the center of spokes. There was a blue light on each spoke just inside the white ones.  The craft was suspended in air as I drove under it.  There was a hushed jet engine sound, or a sound like a hot air balloon getting a charge of hot air. The white lights looked to be completely around the spoke, like a gas lantern globe.  The white lights on the spokes changed in intensity and blocked out the blue ones. Then the white lights on the spokes went down in intensity and the middle white light brightened even more than the three spoked ones, when it went down the white spoke lights brightened again, but not all at the same time as earlier. I was still driving very slow, and it disappeared over some trees as I dove under and by it starting up a tree covered hill. I quickly turned a! round and when I got back to the open location ( 20- 25 seconds? ), the object was gone. This was on a full moon night without a cloud in the sky, visibility was excellent and I had a good view as it was a large valley.

Large, hovering, triangular shaped object(s) in New Albany, Indiana.;2011-12-03 22:13:00;2 minutes;Large, hovering, triangular shaped object(s) in New Albany, Indiana. I am very reluctant to post this. I checked the internet just now and so far, nothing on the news. I was driving West on 256 just past I-65. I realize this was relatively close to the Clark Co. airport, but at this height 40-60 feet it would have been crashing and either much too large or much to close to one another. It was not moving.  I rolled down the window and slowed to nearly a stop to look and listen. It/they were completely silent, triangular shaped, and 40 feet in length from lights at the points. Lights were orange in color. What is strange is the fact that just moments before on the North side of 265, just past 65 in Clark County I had seen an extremely bright, white light near the trailer park approximately the size of an Olympic swimming pool (but round in shape) that came from nowhere, lasted maybe three seconds and went out like a switch was flipped. I pulled over at the Charlestown Road exit to get a look and the hovering object(s) had vanished. I know at least four other cars in front of me saw it too, they slowed down and I could even see a passenger in one car point at it as if to ask, Do you see that too?  I am quite shaken, and a little sick to my stomach.  This wasn't anything remotely resembling any 'normal' aircraft in shape and wasn't like any plane or a helicopter I have ever seen. Approximately 30 seconds before the events, the radio broadcast of the Big Ten Championship game that I was listening too cut out. I thought it was a broadcast error and turned off the radio. I didn't turn the radio back on for several minutes after the event. The broadcast was back on. I am a male. Mid thirties. Caucasian. Married. Children. College educated.  Employed.  I don't care about any kind of recognition, in fact I would prefer none.  But I would love an explanation of what I just saw. I will answer questions if you need more info.;38.3084999999994;-85.8160000000004
