Large disc appearing and disappearing while hovering with no change in direction.;2009-11-01 17:20:00;2 minutes;Large disc appearing and disappearing while hovering with no change in direction. A large metallic disc appeared and disappeared in a very gradual manner above some woods a couple miles off the highway.  It hovered very steadily and had no direct course of flight.  I made absolutely sure that this was not identifiable.  Disappeared without any trace after a couple appearances.;38.3084999999994;-85.8160000000004
Group of Ships over Skyline;2013-04-20 19:00:00;30 minutes;Group of Ships over Skyline I had set up my camera to take photographs of the firework show called thunder over Louisville, it’s the opening to the Derby Festival here in Louisville Kentucky.  I was approximately 7 miles away on top of Spickert knob Road up in Floyd’s knobs and the view that I had you could see the entire landscape and is the highest point in that particular area While I was waiting for the show to start I was taking pictures of the air show, as I was taking photos I saw a group of objects that would appear and disappear in the sky.  I saw them three different times each time and each time I tried to focus on them I was unable to. When I was reviewing my pictures the next day I saw that I happened to catch the group of objects high in the sky over the city well above the airplane that is in the picture.  There looked to be two groups of aircraft flying in formation.  When I soon get in on the picture the crafts all look round cylindrical with a metal color with a definite solid shape on all of them and what looks to be a sit atmosphere at the center of each of the ship much like the reported flying disc.  I emailed a copy of the image to your site in JPEG form however I still have the original photo and a raw format that is too large to email at this time.;38.3084999999994;-85.8160000000004
