Bright Welders Arc Light In The Night Skys Over New Albany Indiana;1998-03-01 22:00:00;1 minute;Bright Welders Arc Light In The Night Skys Over New Albany Indiana Ive been seeing this object now for over 3 years till this very day and also see it about every night and wanted to share it with all who may have seen the same object or may find this object very interesting as i have. To see this object it's best to get outdoors about 15 mintes before dusk and anytime there after before midnight. allthough ive seen it at all hours from dusk till sunrise. This object may appear as a star in the night sky with no movement at times. The object appears mostly as a slow moving star at first and seems to have i very high altitude and moving along as the speed of a high flying commercial airliner. Sometimes it will stop in mid movement also for as long as 15 seconds take or give a few. The most startling thing about this object is it will turn a very bright welders arc bluish white for sometimes as long as 15 seconds then go dim to a very faint like star and go completly accross the horizon till dissapearing. This object will appear at any point in the night sky. Sometimes at the zenith, sometimes at the horizon, any location in the night sky this object may appear. I have observed it 1 time to go from a very bright spotlight like light to a sapphire blue in color. Im still seeing this object to this day along with 5 other witnesses. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the description is reminiscent of a twinkling star.  PD));38.3084999999994;-85.8160000000004
Bright Lights Appear Then Move Off Very Dim In Orange Color;2001-05-18 21:34:00;20 seconds;Bright Lights Appear Then Move Off Very Dim In Orange Color This is the same object ive reported as a welders arc blue light that dosn't twinkle when it shows up in the warm months about everynight and sometimes 4 times a night over my vicinity in southern Indiana in New Albany.... It appears as a satilite at times and dissapears like some of the other reports that people have posted here. This object appeared this time at about 15 degrees directly south of the zenith at 9:34 pm on 5/18/01... The object moved directly north from south and moved very slow after turning a very dim orange in color. This object appeared right before my eyes at the location i mentioned and was a very bright light blue like light that got 3 times the size of the planet Jupter at it's brightest and when it dos this it dosn't look to be hardly moving at all if any across the sky....... After about 10 or 15 seconds glowing bright like mentioned it dims very rapidly to a dim orange in color and starts moving off very slowly still but faster than when it was brightly lit up. Since ive been seeing this object for over 3 years now ive given it a name and call it Kilometer 6....... When i observe this object again i will refer to it as such and thanks for reading..;38.3084999999994;-85.8160000000004
