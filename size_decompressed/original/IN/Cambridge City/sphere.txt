Jet chasing spherical metallic craft;2002-08-15 20:00:00;2 min;Jet chasing spherical metallic craft Just before the sun was beginning to dim on this summer night,.me and three others witnessed a fighter jet in the sky making a rapid straight ascent right in front of us.  We were a few hundred feet north of delaware street in the parking lot of the elementary school there in this real small town of 3000.  When we examined the sky a bit more, we noticed that upwards and to our left was a shining silver sphere with no visible markings.  The temperature of the craft seemed to be much different than the atmosphere because there was a mirage around the whole thing in the clouds, just like a jet' s rocket.  Once this jet got to the altitude of the craft it headed straight for it, but alas could not keep up.   I'm guessing this lasted for 2 minutes and we saw the jet remaining in the sky for a minute or so after the craft was out of sight.  I estimate the craft was only fifteen feet in diameter and looked exactly like a giant BB.;39.8212;-85.1715
