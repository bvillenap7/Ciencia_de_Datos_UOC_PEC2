I looked into the sky and seen a round craft with only 3 white lights on and hovering in the sky..  I had to go to work so I had my eyes on it for 10 minutes but it was still there when I left this area.  It was still dark out so I could only see the shape and the 3 lights that were on.  The lights were like oblong windows.;41.4608678362572;-87.0677619883039
