My husband and I were walking the dogs when he saw this bright light down the street. I initially thought it was one of those luminaries since it seemed like it was on fire.   I realized quickly that it wasn't because it was moving too fast and there was no wind.  We watched it until we couldn't see it anymore.   We continued our walk and not 5 minutes later, we saw the object come back!  We again watched it move to the east until we could no longer see it.   The object was flying lower than any plane yet there was no sound coming from it.;41.4608678362572;-87.0677619883039
