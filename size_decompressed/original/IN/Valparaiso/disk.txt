The object was traveling at an estimated 30-40 thousand feet and at a speed of mach 15-20 or greater. The day was very clear and the object was very clearly seen. The object was traveling almost due south at a rate of speed that would make it absolutely imposible to suggest it was a jet aircraft.  The craft or object was the same color as a typical commercial jet i.e. metalic looking.  There were no lights noted and no contrails.  I looked at the thing for about 10 seconds (the thing was really moving) then it went over my house and was out of sight. The craft was a saucer shape with height i.e. it had thickness and appeared to be some what larger than a jumbo jet.  Again, it was no jet aircraft.  I often wonder why I didn't jump up and try to run out from under my porch and pick up visual contact again. I just sat on my lounge chair and said Wow!  I generally don't believe in UFOs ... but, I know what I saw.  Oh, and there was no sound that I could hear. It was high. I think about this sighting alot. I would like to get some answers if anyone has any. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.4608678362572;-87.0677619883039
