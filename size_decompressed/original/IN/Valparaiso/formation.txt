Three brownish-orange craft;2008-10-14 01:30:00;5 seconds;Three brownish-orange craft On the morning of October 14th 2008 1:32am I was at work on Route 30 and N. 600 W. in Valparaiso Indiana, 46307. I was talking to a fellow worker, he was sitting in the work pick-up truck on the driver side the truck and the door was opened. The truck was facing east and we were on the right hand shoulder. I was standing next to the driver door facing east as well. I saw what appeared to be a flash in the sky just a little to the right of me (2 o’clock). The flash wasn’t like a normal flash in the sky, i.e. lightning, or an explosion it was contained to a small portion of the sky. Then a bright star (in the same area of the flash) began to bulge and seem to be moving or stretching before I could wonder what was happening to the star a streak of brown came from the left of me (11 o’clock) it was like the streak you see when you’re watching a shooting star. The streak began just above us and to the north and turned into three very fast moving crescent shaped objects then swooped down heading south and turned to the south-southeast. The three objects were almost sliding through the curve in the same manner in which a race car slides around a corner. The objects were a brownish-orange and were shaped like a half moon or crescent with one black window in the middle of each side. The objects didn’t fly like a plane they were flying vertically. The rear of the object had a blackish circle. The objects were flying in formation: side by side, the two on the right had made a smooth curve and the one on the left came close to the one in the middle and had to swerve to avoid hitting him, it also increased the speed faster than the other two and pushed himself ahead as if playing a game with the other two. The crafts seem to come from this weird electrical haze and left short gold orange trails behind them. The crafts disappeared as fast as they appeared and they also made no sound and had no lights. The craft were no more than 800 feet off the ground (very close). The whole thing lasted nearly 5 seconds, not even long of enough to fully comprehend what just happened.;41.4608678362572;-87.0677619883039
Bright vertical 3 star formation.;2018-07-28 04:30:00;30 seconds;Bright vertical 3 star formation While walking south with my dog in the front of my property, I saw what I thought was a very close and very bright view of Orion's belt, within seconds the three star vertical formation looked as if it were pulsing/blinking and fading/dimming out and moving downward.   At first I thought it was covered by a cloud, but it was a clear sky it that direction, with some visible clouds above me.  The sky was very still, with no wind.  I continued to watch the area for several minutes and they never reappeared.  The formation did not make my dog react, as it was in the distance.;41.4608678362572;-87.0677619883039
Straight line formation of  30 bright objects traveling east.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-26 21:10:00;3 minutes;Straight line formation of  30 bright objects traveling east. A straight line formation of 30 to 40 bright objects that stretched for several miles and was moving in an ESE direction.;41.4608678362572;-87.0677619883039
