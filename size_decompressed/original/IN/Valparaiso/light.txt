Small white flying object flying faster than a normal aircraft.;2014-11-15 10:30:00;5 seconds;Small white flying object flying faster than a normal aircraft. Looking a pair of hawks flying over head when I saw a small fast moving white object flying over head at a high alt.  I could not make out what kind of aircraft it was nor it was leaving a white smoke trail as other aircraft does.   I did not have time to  get my camera to take a picture.;41.4608678362572;-87.0677619883039
Streaks of light seen at sunset. Changed position and color.;2019-04-20 19:45:00;15 minutes;Streaks of light seen at sunset. Changed position and color. At first, I saw what appeared to be a regular airplane, as seen from a distance, flying diagonally upward and leaving a trail of smoke in its path.  Looking closer, I noticed there were three smaller, thinner horizontal trails of light beneath this larger light.  Next to the airplane was another large light, which looked like a fireball with a trail of light behind it.  It, too, was flying upward at first, but then switched direction, looking like it was facing the direction of my house.  It also changed color, from yellow to red, before changing directions again (heading downward). Over the course of approximately 15 minutes, these five lights shifted directions several times.  At one point, an airplane was flying toward one of the lights, and as soon as the airplane got too close, the light vanished. Eventually, the lights began to disappear.  Some dived into the horizon while others simply faded away.;41.4608678362572;-87.0677619883039
