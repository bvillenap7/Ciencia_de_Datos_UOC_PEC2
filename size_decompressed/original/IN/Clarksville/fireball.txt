So i am having my smoke and i look up directly above me and i see what appears to be a glowing ember floating in the sky above, so while i am watching i realise it seems to be something else, i also realise at the same time it cant be an ember because it is not only moving to fast, but it is making a figure8 patteren and looks to be like something watching the fireworks. So i go get my son who is 10, because we both like to watch the sky at night, and i show him what i see and he sees it, and we stood there watching it for about 15 min, it also besides making a figure8 it seem to be circling around making controlled movements. This is the first time he has seen what i would describe as a UFO we have seen lights that to me are too fast for a satellite while living in Oregon but never made these type of movements, they would just be hooking across the sky in a strait line, but this was the best sighting I have ever had..Anyhow it speeds off twords Louisville as soon as the fireworks stopped and it stops and starts making the same movements over the city, well then it speeds off again and we watch till it fades out of sight..;38.3103;-85.7611999999999
