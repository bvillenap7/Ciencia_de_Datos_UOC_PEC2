Craft-like object, rectangular projection on a circular object.  Animal reactions.  (MUFON report);2018-09-10 21:00:00;Several minutes;Craftlike object, rectangular projection on a circular object.  Animal reactions. Witness noticed Venus, following the sunset, and Saturn, in the SSW, were very bright as he arrived home.  As usual his neighbor's dog, a large but very friendly, female, Pit Bull mix, was there to greet him.  After watching Venus for a moment he saw, a few degrees off, what looked like a huge band of lights - white surrounded by red - began flashing and moving in his direction.  As soon as the flashing began the dog seemed frightened.  Whining, repeatedly bumping his legs and jumping up to push on his chest.  When the object was almost directly overhead the lights changed to all white and flashing sequentially from rear to front.  At that point a soft gold color glow defined the edges, giving him the shape he tried to illustrate.  The object silently continued east until lost behind a stand of trees.  As soon as the object was out of sight the dog made a short huffing sound, looked at him for a moment, then, seeing no reaction, calmly went home.  He noticed something else.  He has raccoons in his attic space.  They are usually active from dusk til dawn.  At that time it was strangely quiet up there - an hour after the event.
