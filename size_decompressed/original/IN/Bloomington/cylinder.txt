Myself and a friend, while riding bikes in a southerly direction, saw a bright white cylinder (with a slight blue tint) moving swiftly towards the horizon. When we first spotted it, it was approximately 45 degrees above the horizon. It was moving very fast, and then we lost visual contact as trees blocked our view. When we discussed it with friends later we discovered that two others saw it at the same time, both were in their cars, both were traveling south. The object was moving in a line a bit east of directly south. It moved in a straight trajectory and did not waver from it's path. Again, it was moving *very* fast, but it was not and airplane or a meteor. It also seemed to leave a slight trail, same glowing white color as the object. I perceived it as being not close at all, but very far away.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
