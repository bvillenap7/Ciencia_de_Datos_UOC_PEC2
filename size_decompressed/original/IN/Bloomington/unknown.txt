Large, Low and Fast Silver Object Over Bloomington IN;2007-06-05 22:45:00;10 seconds;Large, Low and Fast Silver Object Over Bloomington IN I am visiting my family on their farm, which is on the north side of Bloomington, IN, near Oliver Winery, and a mile west of State Rd 37.  I went outside to get something from the car and a large silver object streaked across the sky.  It was going from the east to the west and was very low.  It went so fast that I could not see the shape.  It was large, flying low, maybe 500 feet up or so, and traveled very fast.  It did not emit beams of light but the object was bright. The sky was clear and I saw two planes flying very high, both headed generally north as I looked to see if I would see anything else.   I have been a sky-watcher for years and I have never seen anything like this.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
