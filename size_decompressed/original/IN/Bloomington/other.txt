When I got my thing;2016-06-15 00:00:00;5-8 minutes;It was late at night, sometime in the cold weather of 2016, I was doing my chemistry homework at my sister's house.  When I got my things and was trying to leave, I noticed a big bright light right over the treeline in front of our house.  At first it was a couple lights strung out into a horizontal line, I thought it was just a plane in the distance.  My sister was walking with me out the door when we both stopped to watch the plane fly over because theres a small airport behind our house.  After a minute or so the lights didn't seem to be getting closer and then began getting brighter and the string of lights swayed loosely from left to right like it was hung from a string.  The lights would pulsate with brightness, each light seems to have the strength of a cluster of football stadium lights.  They were so bright but didn't seem to be shining on anything.  Then, the lights began to move around, seemingly adjusting themselves.  They'd stack on top of each other and fold in and out, move around.  There were about four lights that we saw and they'd flicker on and off.  They appear to be hovering, tilting or teetering in place, they'd clump and then the next second be in a linear position.  My sister and I were both very confused and waited for the flying object to get closer.  It felt like forever until it finally steered around a tree down our street and right over our neighbors house.  When it started getting closer to us, some of the light started flashing red and blue, so my sister assumed it was some sort of police drone.. but it was as big as, of not bigger than a family van.  When it was close, it was close enough for me to be able to hypothetically throw a rock at it and successfully hit it.  It got so close to us. The shape of the vehicle is hard to describe...  The body was a sort of flattened sphere and had two pill shaped turbines on either side.  From what I saw, it was a polished black color.  There seemed t! o be a sort of have around it, and made me second guess how we! ll my ey es were seeing.  What surrounded it was a type of hazy fog of some sort, but barely noticeable since it was dark out.  The only sound I remember hearing is a light strange whirring.  No helicopter blade sounds, no engine sounds, no revving or propeller, nothing. Just a quiet deep whirring.  I've Googled big drones and police drones, nothing near matches what my sister and I saw.  We took notes and drew pictures as soon as we went back inside to tell our parents. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
