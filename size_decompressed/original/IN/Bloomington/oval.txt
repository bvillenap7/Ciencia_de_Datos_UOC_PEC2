Three Faint Oval Shaped Objects Flying In Apparent Formation At Night;1977-02-21 23:42:00;approximately 7 seconds;Three Faint Oval Shaped Objects Flying In Apparent Formation At Night At 11:42 PM EST February 21, 1977 while star gazing from the parking lot of my apartment building on N. Grant Street in Bloomington, Indiana I observed three faint elliptical objects of less apparent visual magnitude than the star Mizar in the constellation Ursa Major. At the time of observation I was attempting to set up my telescope to observe the Mizar visual binary star system in the handle of Ursa Major. While sighting down the length of my telescope to get an approximate aim at Mizar, I saw three faint gray oval objects cross the area that I was about to observe. The sighting was naked eye and lasted only about seven seconds. The objects appeared to be solid oval shapes with a major axis of about 1/4 at arms length. The appeared to be in a staggered formation, one oval slightly behind and to the side of the previous oval. In addition they seemed not to hold a tight formation but rather wandered slightly from a tight formation. The objects revealed no discernable detail to the naked eye and there was no time to track them with the telescope. There was no sound or other phenomena associated with the sighting. The heading that they traveled was approximately 285 degrees and the distance covered in the time I viewed them was approximately 85 degrees across the sky until they were lost behind trees. Altitude and size indeterminable. I have seen terrestrial light reflect from the bottom of low, night flying birds before and this sighting was of similar luminosity, however these objects were solid oval in shape.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
SEVEN CRAFTS FLASHING , IN ORION'S BELT CONSTALATION FORMATION!!!!;2001-09-02 02:58:00;2 hours;SEVEN CRAFTS FLASHING , IN ORION'S BELT CONSTALATION FORMATION!!!! Oval shaped discs, with flashing lights going around the outside. The crafts are shaped into the constallation of orion, but that doesn't come out til winter, so i know it couldn't be the stars. The crafts are all blinking with white, red and green lights going around. three of the crafts are stacked in a row, one on top of each other, they are about a thumb apart from top to bottom. clear night on the Iu campus, on the outskirts of campus so not much light filtering through. VERY Strange, it looks like they are just staying in the same place.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574

Before sunset a hovering oval metallic object quickly ascends into a cloud in central Indiana.;2014-07-28 20:45:00;20 seconds;Before sunset a hovering oval metallic object quickly ascends into a cloud in central Indiana. It was around sunset on a partly cloudy evening.  I was driving south on highway 37 approaching the W. Third Street exit, when I noticed a very bright metallic object hovering just below a large cloud.  I noticed the object because it was shining so brightly yet the sun was not shining in that direction.  I didn't see lights on the object either.   At first I thought it might be some type of aircraft, but that just didn't seem possible with the hovering.   Before I could point out the object to person riding with me, the object moved straight up into the large cloud and disappeared.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
