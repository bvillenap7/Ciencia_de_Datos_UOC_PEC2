Saucer shaped craft with kaleidoscope lights.;2003-10-11 20:30:00;3.minutes;Saucer shaped craft with kaleidoscope lights. I am a 53 year old mother of four.  I have always considered myself to be a sensible person and faith believing.  What I saw on that cold evening in the sky left me puzzeled.  This object was at my best guestimation 70 to 80 feet across with lights on the bottom of this disk. The lights were moving from the outer edge toward the center in the shapes of rectangles.  It appeared to have louvers toward the center.  When the light reached the center it would radiate back out toward the edge.  It appeared as if you were looking in a kaleidoscope.  The lights were a brilliant white.  I watched this for 3 minutes as it moved from northeast direction to a southwest direction.  I went to the house to get my husband.  When we came out, it was gone.

Photo revealed oval shaped object;2020-10-20 20:48:00;1 minute;Photo revealed oval shaped object While looking back at some pictures I had taken, I saw this strange oblong object in the air that I can’t really explain. I am a student, a science major, and I was walking across campus to my apartment after working late in the lab when I took these photos. In the moment, I didn’t notice anything amiss except that it was very foggy that night. I was taking a picture with my phone because I thought the way the nearby street lamp was illuminating some tree leaves looked interesting. I don’t recall anyone near me when I took the photos, although people may have been walking further down on the sidewalk and still had some line of vision to where this object appears to be. Because I didn’t see it in the moment, I don’t know what actions this object took either except moving due north, as it moves from right to left between the two pictures. Personally, I’m not inclined to believe it is aliens without knowing any more than I do right now, but I really do wonder how something else! , such as a drone, could have been operated, because there was heavy fog and low visibility that night.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
