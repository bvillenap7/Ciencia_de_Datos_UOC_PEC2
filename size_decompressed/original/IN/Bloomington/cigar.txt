I am a graduate student at Indiana University.  I was out taking my dogs for a walk, and my attention was drawn to the sky because there was something moving very rapidly there.  At first, I thought it was a meteor, but then I noticed that there were 4, evenly-spaced, seemingly artificial lights on what appeared to be the bottom of an aircraft.  It was too high to make out any shape other than that of the lights, which were in a straight, narrow line (like a cigar).  I didn't hear any noise.  I do know that this craft was going way too fast to be any sort of conventional aircraft.  I was following it very closely with my eyes as it streaked across the sky when it suddenly disappeared.  It was a very clear night, so there is little chance it went behind a cloud, etc. I had just about convinced myself that I had imagined the whole thing, when I noticed about five planes circling the area.  That's when I decided to submit a report, to see if anyone else in this area might have seen the same thing.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
Daylight Sighting of Cigar-shaped object over Bloomington;2010-04-28 15:00:00;-2 minutes;Daylight Sighting of Cigar-shaped object over Bloomington Cigar-shaped Object  Location: Bloomington, Indiana  Date: 28April2010  Time: 03:00 PM, EST  Weather Conditions: Full sun, no clouds  # Witnesses: 1   Witness (name on file) was outside a local cafe’ on Covenanter Drive when he noticed a cigar-shaped object at approximately 30 degrees above the horizon, SSE of his position. Using the ‘dime held at arm's length reference,’ the length of what I saw was approximately 4 dimes, and the width was approximately 1/2 dime. It was moving from east to west, slowly, from my left to my right, and was not only moving forward, but was also slowly ascending, without changing attitude.  The object was medium gray in color with a very slight tinge of copper.  When asked if the object produced a sound, the witness responded,  No sound emanating from the object that I could discern.  Additional witness observation:  At the same time, there were also two normal jet aircraft that were visible in the SSE sky, with normal contrails. One of these was flying north, and the other one was flying south, but at very high altitude.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
