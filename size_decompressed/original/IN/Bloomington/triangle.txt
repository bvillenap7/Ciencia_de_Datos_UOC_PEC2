From a distance, driving east on Indiana 45, I saw a bright yellow light with a white light, not as bright, next to it [on the same craft] hovering in the sky. There were tiny red lights on top, none on the belly. As I rounded a bend [between Bloomington and New Unionville, Indiana] I saw that the craft was about 50 feet above treetop and crossing the road right to left, directly overhead. I pulled off to watch and noticed other vehicles behind me had also done so. There was no noise - I rolled down my window to listen - nothing. As the craft passed over my car, I got a good look at it against 'night sky light pollution' from Bloomington - it was triangle-shaped, with a white light in each of the three wing tips and appeared to be black in color. A mile or so down the road, the snow looked blown across the road like drifting. The rest of the roadway was clear. I thought copter at first, until I saw the thing. Not like any I had ever seen. It seemed like when motorists had pulled off to watch it flew away. ((NUFORC Note:  Time appears to be approximate.  PD));39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
A dark triangle moving through the sky.;2004-02-15 22:50:00;15 seconds;A dark triangle moving through the sky. I was outside my friend's aparptment in the city, looking up at the sky. The star I was looking at suddenly dissapeared then reappeared. Catching my attention, I then noticed that there was a large triangular object moving westward through the sky without any lights or sound. It moved slowly and I could see its outline because blocked out the background behind it and it also reflected a small amount of light from the city below. Thinking that my eyes were playing tricks on my or my glasses had a glare, I removed my glasses and was still able to see the object and the small amount of light reflected from it. I watched it until it became hard to differentiate from the night sky. At that time I ran inside to get my friend.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574

The three of us stood and watched the vehicle as it hovered completely still for about two minutes.  It then very slowly rotated counter clockwise 180 degrees and then suddenly blinked out and was gone.   Within a few moments we noticed a small plane arrive in the same area as where the craft was and began making circles, as if they saw it, too, and were looking for it.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
