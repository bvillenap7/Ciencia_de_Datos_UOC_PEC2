white falling circle in the sky in Bloomington Indiana;2006-08-09 04:30:00;only a few seconds, it wa;white falling circle in the sky in Bloomington Indiana I was with a friend in her van, and we where looking into the woods behind my house...  We looked up and there was a freaky white (circle) light falling in the sky.   It was way to close to be a shooting star!  It was there and then it vanished behind an apatment building.  The person I was with said that it was a UFO, but just to be on the safe side we both made a wish and put our hands in our pockets, just in case it was a shooting star.  We tryed to call a hotline one hour after it happened but it was out of service....  so I went online and found you. We are both college aged kids just up late visiting my boyfriend at work....  nothing special about tonight.  All I know is that it was really creepy, and I just want to know if anyone else saw, whatever it was. Bloomington Indiana is the mecca for all freaky migration...  alot of strange things go on here.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
