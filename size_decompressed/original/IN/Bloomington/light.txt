Three large bright white craft  interacting & manuevering rapidly accross a quadrant of night sky.;1973-10-01 20:00:00;20 minutes;Three large bright white craft  interacting & manuevering rapidly accross a quadrant of night sky. The year is 1973, and the month is Oct.  It is around 8:00 PM, clear skies and a full or nearly full moon.  The location is southern central Indiana.  I was attending graduate courses at Indiana University.  I was a passenger in the front right seat and my children ages 4 & 5 yrs. were in the back seat.  We were returning from an afternoon in nearby Brown Co. state park, having already stopped for food.. I was looking at the sky out the window to see if I could discern any constellations to point out to the children.  I was startled to see three bright white large objects moving at great speed across approximately a quadrant of the sky.  I asked my friend driving to pull over and stop, which he did and we all got out to observe. The objects appeared to be at a quite high altitude but definitely within the orbit of the moon as they several times crossed in front of the moon and were quite visible as they were much brighter.  They were equal in size and appeared to be one sixth to one eighth the size of the moon.  Their movements remained within a quadrant of the sky, exhibiting incredible speed even during right angle turns.  My son commented that they were playing tag, which was an accurate description of their movements.  Several times two of the objects approached very close and began to spin about one another.  This maneuver reminded me of videos I’ve seen of eagles who lock talons in flight and spin about each other. This activity continued for about 20 minutes, then they all departed outward toward space and within seconds were no longer visible.  During this event two other cars stopped to observe, so a total number of witnesses was eight.  When it was over everyone looked at each other somewhat wide eyed, and shrugging shoulders got back in their respective vehicles and departed as well.  No one spoke to each other.  I didn’t know any of the other witnesses and never saw any of them again. ((NUFORC Note:  One of three very nice reports from the same witness.  PD));39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574

Appeared orange in the cloud, southwest stopped, moved northeast on parallel course to original, disappeared behind tree, appeared again to the south of original location. to the The light appeared in the cloud bank above my apartment complex, fairly high in the sky.  It moved southwest, stopped, and moved northeast on a parallel path.  Then it disappeared behind a tree and appeared again to the south of the original locale. Then it disappeared totally in the clouds.  I only saw one and it was orange in color, but that could have been the clouds altering the light. Shortly after I witnessed this, I did see a commercial aircraft headed north, I imagine it was bound for the Indianapolis airport. I am an employee in the local mall and am 21 years of age.  I grew up just north of this town and know the area fairly well.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
White/red/blue light over Bloomington, IN between 11pm and 3am on November 11 and 13.;2001-11-11 23:00:00;4 hours;White/red/blue light over Bloomington, IN between 11pm and 3am on November 11 and 13. At about eleven in the evening sometime in the second week of November, 2001, (I'm not entirely sure of the date, though I think it was the eleventh,) my roommate directed my attention out our dorm window to a strange light in the sky northwest of the IU Bloomington campus. It was admittedly rather hazy that night, though what kind of conventional aircraft appears as a bright light periodically highlighted by flashes of red and blue and stays in one place for exceptional periods of time? My roommate gathered three of his friends to watch the show helicopters (we think, they didn't make any sound) had begun to show up at about ten past eleven and circle around the light. Wanting to be a bit more indulged, I went down to the street (East 3rd) and ventured west to Jordan Avenue to have a closer look. I'd at first thought the light was much farther northwest, but apparently it was less than a mile from our dorm and thus slightly north of the campus, directly up Jordan Ave. As soon as I made the intersection and this observation, it arced up to the west very, very quickly from a dead stop. I lost sight of it for the trees, so I kept going west along 3rd Street and made a stop on top of the Ballantine Hall parking garage. I looked around and didn't see anything, so I headed back. As I approached Jordan Ave. heading east, I saw it again, motionless over a residential area to the southeast, seemingly about the same distance it was from me before. The helicopters were gone at this time. I didn't bother going after it the cops were prone to patrol the area for party-goers at that time of night and it was late. I thus sat out in front of my dorm and watched it do practically nothing for the next half-hour or so and went back up to my room, as there wasn't much left for intrigue. I did some work until about 3am and went out for a coffee, and was a little surprised to see that the object was still in the same place, still doing practically nothing. It was in the exact same place for the duration of the same time ! period t wo days later as well. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the object may have been a celestial body, but that is only a guess.

UFO observed south of Bloomington Indiana moved horizontally;2002-11-19 18:45:00;5 min;UFO observed south of Bloomington Indiana moved horizontally It was an extremely clear dark sky with few clouds.  It was also extremely quiet out with no extraneous sounds observed.  I saw an object that seemed to have three lights on it and at first thought it was an airplane inbound to Bloomington airport.  I noticed a beam of light extending from the front of the craft which I assumed was landing lights.  The beam extended such a distance that I called my partner outside to observe the light trail.  The object did not appear to be moving, so I assumed it was heading towards me.  After a few minutes, the object moved roughly 10 degrees horizontally to the west, then a few degrees back to east, and then again a few degrees to the west.  At this point the craft came again to a standstill.  It then began to drop slowly towards the ground and was occluded by a line of trees.  This is the last I saw of the craft.  As a last note, I noticed strange cloud formations that seemed to lead to the original location of the object.  While this could have been coincidence, the clouds looked like an entry trail.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
Light moving from East to West above Lake Lemon near Bloomington.;2006-08-16 03:45:00;5 Minutes;Light moving from East to West above Lake Lemon near Bloomington. Light was seen moving from East to West about 2/3 above the southern horizon.  At first we thought it might be a satellite, but then it started changing speed and direction.  It seemed to randomly wobble back and forth, and slow down and speed up.  Whatever it was, it was pretty high up.  No shape could be seen, just the light, which was as bright as some of the brightest stars.  As it approached the western horizon, the light stopped and stayed in one place while it slowly faded away.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574

I was speaking with my mother on a cordless phone in my back yard at approximately 22:00. I was looking at the big dipper to the North when I noticed a small orange dot moving slowly across the sky just below the bottom star of the big dipper ( I think it's called Pollux. I thought it was an airplane at first, then I noticed that it wasn't blinking. I watched it more closely because I then though it might be a satellite or the International Space Station. Suddenly, the orange dot moved extremely quickly up several degrees, down about double the distance, back up the same distance as the previous move, then down at an angle right near the star Pollux and it blinked out. It was gone. This is my first experience seeing something like this. I am submitting this report because I would like to know if anyone else reported anything similar at the same date/time/location.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
Star like, slow moving craft, only ever seen descending, not ascending.;2011-03-02 01:00:00;more than 1/2 hour;Star like, slow moving craft, only ever seen descending, not ascending. 2nd time I have witnessed this, however, the night before I am reporting this, I saw a strange, bright, flashing (twinkling fast) star.  Which now I think was the same craft. It is not very obvious unless you stand there and watch it with a reference point as, like I said it just looks like a very flashy star.  But it steadily but slowly descends.  I can see red in the color but only after looking at it for a while.  It is in the Western sky, slightly south.  Has been in the same spot both times I have witnessed it descending.  Like a said, it looks very much like a star except it descends slowly, however, faster than the night sky changes.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
10 orange lights were seen above Lake Monroe, Indiana.;2012-06-22 23:30:00;3 minutes;10 orange lights were seen above Lake Monroe, Indiana. On Friday evening, June 22, 2012, at “Eagle Pointe” resort on Lake Monroe, Indiana, My son, daughter, daughter-in-law and grandson and I witnessed the following:  Ten orange lights crossed at about 75 degrees from the horizon above us at what I would estimate to be five to ten thousand feet elevation.  They appeared in sequence crossing from northwest to southeast in this pattern: five together in a triangular shape, followed by a pair and another pair and, finally, a single light.  They were distinctly orange, moving rapidly, but not apparently at terrifically high speed there was a complete absence of sound.  After they passed over us, they disappeared – apparently accelerating away soundlessly.  In relation to other objects in the night sky, they were much larger than stars, and seemed large for their elevation.  My grandson was able to use a digital camera, not a cell phone, to record most of the event.  We have uploaded the 2 minute, 13 second video to a laptop computer.  I will submit that file soon.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
I looked up to find two craft at high altitude that looked just like a star...;2016-05-12 06:30:00;10 seconds;My dad was dropping me off at my grandma's house, but she forgot to unlock a door for me to go in, so my dad waited and I went around to the back door to find it liked as well.  I then went back around front to find that my dad had left.   It was just as the sun was barely coming up for sunrise and I was looking west, when a cat suddenly snuck up on me... It Iiked to have given me a heart attack!  But it looked up past me and meowed.  Wondering why on Earth a cat would look in the sky, as because grandma still hadn't unlocked the door, I looked up at what he had meowed at.  I looked up to find two craft at high altitude that looked just like a star...   At first, I thought it was just me, but then I stood their and watched one of them stop completely, while the other one morphed into the other than split again and started doing a figure 8 pattern around the other just about that time my grandma opened the door and I just stopped thinking about it...  Later though it started to raise suspicion and I just now got a chance to report it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Light orbs in woods and lower sky.;2016-10-20 00:00:00;1 year+;light orbs in woods and lower sky. Various and odd light orbs in woods and low sky   I am a married 59 year-old woman with a college education. I spend part of my time in a home surrounded with thick woods, at least 400 acres, near Bloomington, Indiana. There are a couple of neighbors about one acre of wooded area away from me on one side. The landscape is hilly with ravines and trees up to 100 feet tall. Since October 2016 I have witnessed countless observations of strange lights from all sides of my home. I have become addicted to “orb gazing” every single night I visit this country home. In a nutshell here are the types of lights I have seen over the year:  Singular, stationary, white light orbs in various parts of the woods, usually from one to five feet high. I’m guessing they occur anywhere from 25 to 250 feet away from me. I have shined a flashlight on them and sometimes I can see a glowing “orb.” It’s hard to gauge their sizes, but from where I stand at the edge of the woods they are anywhere from 1-7 inches. (I’m just guessing. I’m not good with measurement.)  Orbs that grow bigger and seem to shine right at me like a very bright flashlight.  This scares me a bit.  (I’m alone out there.)  I get the sense the orbs know I’m there. The last night of observation a “flashlight” glared at me as I stood transfixed in my long driveway, then suddenly just went out!  I scurried away fast and stayed on my porch. Lights that literally move as though they were eyes and are peering around.  They also wobble and will sneakily move position so that I have to keep moving my head to see where they went. Morphing orbs. I swear they sometimes divide into two or more lights and then sometimes back to one.  They sometimes change color from white to yellow, gold, orange or red. Mostly they are white. Sometimes the orbs present themselves as “headlights,” but their lights are closer together.  I get a bit spooked by these types of lights, as it appears to me that they are gawking around. Lately I’ve observed bright flashes of light that appear like “flashlights” that move around. It’s difficult to explain how they move because they seem to be controlled by “someone” or “something,” but I am absolutely certain no human is out there.  I open my windows to listen and I hear nothing. Large reflected areas in the tree tops. I have no idea what these are.  I have only been seeing them recently. 8. “Fake Stars.” I call them that because they used to fool me into thinking they were real stars. I will be looking out the upstairs windows at the trees and see sneaky little lights that first appear as stars suddenly disappear and move to another spot near, on top, or in front of the tall trees.  I’ve noticed these fake stars only come out if there are real stars out. Last night I saw one on the same night as a full moon.  It seemed to twinkle at me and when I watched it, it disappeared.  I found it moments later in a lower segment of the tree.  Then it disappeared again. I have been able to sometimes catch the lights with my smart phone.  I wish I had a really good night time video cam.  It frustrates me not to be able to show what I see to others.  A friend and my son have both seen at least one orb each. I used to be such a skeptic and never believed in ufos or ghosts, but I have opened my mind to many possibilities. I go from thinking these lights are mystical, spirits, ghosts, entities from another dimension, and ufos.  Because I am observing more “flashlight” movement and am getting the feeling that some of these lights are being controlled by some hidden force I am actually getting scared (again, like when I first started seeing these crazy things) and feel the need to share this information with others who are interested.  Why is no one I know interested?  This is phenomenal stuff happening and everyone I know doesn’t care. My god, something’s going on and we need to pay attention.  At the very least it seems scientists would be all over this.  They know everything about glow worms and fireflies and planets, but they are mute about the light orbs in the woods and fake stars in the sky. So in conclusion of this long-winded essay,  I just want to know what these lights are.  UFOs?  Should I be concerned?

Three lights;2020-07-07 00:00:00;~1 hour;Three lights At around 23:00, I saw what I quickly assumed was a plane: three red, constant lights. Thinking nothing of it, I looked away and resumed watching YouTube videos.  About an hour later I looked out my window again.  The object was in the exact same spot.  I have never seen lights there before.  It moved up and down a little bit, but not side to side.  I tried to get a photo, but it was like photographing stars.  The lights were too far away and not bright enough to show up on camera.  I texted my friend to ask for a UFO hotline number, and when I looked back the lights were gone.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
