When driving back to my apartment at about 0:45 on December 1st, 2009, I saw a large, moderately bright, yellow to orange fireball shaped object falling from the sky towards the earth. I only saw this for a very short time, as I was driving. It stayed lit and falling until it fell behind the horizon. There was a tail to the object. It was long and consistent throughout the entire fall. It was larger than any meteor or shooting star I had ever seen. It did not move at a very fast rate.;39.1544674094707;-86.5331922005574
