Around 7:50 am on the morning of September 30, 2005, my children and I were on our way to school. My daughter looked into the southeast sky and asked me if I was seeing what she was.   I told her I was and we proceded to watch as the cigar shaped object danced across the sky.  The object was red and silver, no wings and no smoke.  It seemed to glide up and down.  There was no noise.  When it turned on its side it seemed to have disappeared.   Then it would appear out of no where.   This lasted approximately 6 minutes.;41.0689;-85.0164
