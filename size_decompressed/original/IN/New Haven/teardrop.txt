Fast moving object with three white lights in front of it silently going across the sky;2004-08-20 20:00:00;a couple of minutes;Fast moving object with three white lights in front of it silently going across the sky I was driving over to a friends and spotted what I thought at first was a aircraft with its landing lights on approaching me in a southwest to northeast direction.  It was going really fast and I glanced up at it as it passed behind me in the car and I tried to see if it had wings and couldn't tell if it did or not.  I drove up a short distance on the road and turned in a east direction on another road and seen the aircraft again.  It was going away from me flying in a straight line and thats when I seen what leads me to believe it was UFO.  It had two sets of what looked like three windows on the back with a flashing redlight located where a planes tailfin would be located.  I lost it below the horizon after it got past the treeline and when I turned on another road and headed north, I looked east and could not see this object.  After I had thought about it, I realized that this object did not make a sound.  My friend convinced me to report this sighting on your site.;41.0689;-85.0164
