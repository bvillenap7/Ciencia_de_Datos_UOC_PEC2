Cigar shaped object with 2 bright white lights on either side;2019-07-27 00:00:00;30 seconds;Cigar shaped object with 2 bright white lights on either side Observed a cigar shaped object moving east to west at approximately 5000ft.  The object was quite large and had 2 rectangle shaped lights on the bottom at either end of the craft which lit up for a second as the craft paused in the sky then when the lights went out it jump several hundred feet forward and repeated that pattern as it made it way across the sky.  It was completely silent and flew directly over our location as all 3 of us looked up and tried to make sense of what we were seeing.  Kinda flew like a rocket but no sound or smoke and flew parallel to the ground. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.3727;-87.4802
