Unidentified flying object, red circle with yellow center floating in the sky.;2012-05-06 01:00:00;5 minutes;Unidentified flying object, red circle with yellow center floating in the sky. My fiance' and I were outside looking at the moon because of how large it was. We were taking pictures because it was a beautiful sight. In the process we saw an unidentified object floating across the sky. It was a red circle with a yellow center, we were able to capture a photo of this. When we went through all of the pictures we took of the moon we realized that we actually caught the object in other pictures as well. I am looking to find out what this is.;41.3525;-86.3060999999999
