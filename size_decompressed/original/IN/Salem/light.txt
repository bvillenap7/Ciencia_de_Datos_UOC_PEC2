stationary -bright- sparkling/twinkling object in mid northwestern sky. 9:05 - 9:25pm est;2006-10-04 21:10:00;20 mins;stationary -bright- sparkling/twinkling object in mid northwestern sky. 9:05 - 9:25pm est Flashing/sparkling/twinkling light in shades of reds, whites and blues. A little larger than what Venus used to look like with the naked eye. In the middle of the northwestern sky. It looked like what a close airplane might look like if it were hovering and flashing the lights rapidly. It wasn't necessarily low or close...but very noticeable in the middle of a clear sky.  It flashed/twinkled/sparkled for about 10 mins before I got my daughter. She saw the same thing. We watched it for another 10-15 minutes before some low clouds of a nearing front covered up the view. I spend a lot of time outside at this time of the evening, am very knowledgable about astronomy and weather and I've never seen anything like this before. I don't really believe in UFOs persay...but this was weird....weird enough for me to document it, and research it for a logical answer.;38.6084000000001;-86.0753999999999
