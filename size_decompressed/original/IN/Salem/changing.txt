Pulsing, shape-shifting UFO in Southern Indiana.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius is to the left of, and below, Orion.  PD));2010-08-28 06:00:00;45 minutes;Pulsing, shape-shifting UFO in Southern Indiana I live in Southern Indiana, near Louisville, Kentucky.  On Saturday, August 28, 2010, at approximately 6:00 a.m., I observed a very bright, odd-looking  “light” in the eastern sky near Orion’s belt.  It was brighter and larger than anything else in the sky. The light would glow bright and produce a huge halo around itself, then it would dim, in a very slow pulse. The light, when glowing bright, formed elongated spikes of light above and below the main part of the light. I got my binoculars to observe the light closer. With the binoculars, I could see in the center of the light three colored orbs: red, blue, green, positioned in a triangle to each other. In succession, each orb would glow bright, then dim (not flashing). I observed the light until the dawn made it impossible. During the entire time I watched the light it did not move its location in the sky neither vertical nor horizontal. I attempted to observe the light the next morning at the exact same time and place but it was no longer there. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius is to the left of, and below, Orion.
