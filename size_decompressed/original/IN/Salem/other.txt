On Sunday, May 24, 2020, I was out running in the early morning in a rural area of Southern Indiana.  It was a clear, crisp morning with bright blue, cloudless skies.  At approximately 7:30 a.m., I witnessed an object with a small drone like body flash across the sky from west to east at missile like speed.  The drone like body was whitish in color with an electric blue to aqua colored “headlight- like” light in the front.  I thought this was unusual as I would normally expect a power source of something flying so fast to be in the rear of the object and not in the front, if in fact it was the power source.  The overall size of the object was surprisingly small with the bluish light by far being more visible than the body.  I estimate the angle of elevation to have been approximately 45 – 50 degrees.  The object was flying at a surprisingly low level in the sky.  It was easy to see this because additionally there were two cargo or passenger planes flying much, much higher in the sky.  I was extremely taken with the speed at which the object was moving as well.  I estimate that it was only in my eyesight for 2 to 3 seconds.  I had never seen anything move that fast and it made me want to check on the news to see if anything had happened as well as file this report.  It reminded me of something from the movies flying at an exaggerated rate of speed.  I speculated that it might be something military in nature.  It did not make me think “aliens,” but who knows.  In conclusion, I never expected to see an unidentified flying object in broad daylight.;38.6084000000001;-86.0753999999999
