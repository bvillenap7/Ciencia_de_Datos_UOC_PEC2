Formation of Chinese lanterns;2011-07-04 23:00:00;30 minutes;formation of chinese lanterns There was a release of Sky Lanterns, or Chinese lanterns during the July 4 fireworks display.   I was stopped at a truck stop at exit 240 on I-65 and was watching the fireworks displays at approximately 2230 or 2300 when I noticed a series of orange lights start to float up from the ground in the general direction of Hebron, Indiana.  They drifted up one after another until there were about twenty total.   They were drifting with the wind in a westernly direction and were definitely sky lanterns.  I was close enough to see what they were and recognized them immediately. There were quite a few other people in the area who saw them and many were wondering what they were so it would not surprise me if any UFO reports were to come in from this area regarding this sighting.   The lanterns were orange-yellow in color and created several formations, including triangles, as they sailed through the sky.   The event lasted approximately 30 minutes before they all flickered out one by one and disappeared. I'm only reporting this because I saw that NUFORC was asking for reports of intentional releases of pyrotechnical devices. I hope this helps. ((NUFORC Note:  We note that 30 minutes is a very long time for a pyrotechnic device to burn.  We would like to see video of the alleged event.  PD));41.3126;-87.2072
