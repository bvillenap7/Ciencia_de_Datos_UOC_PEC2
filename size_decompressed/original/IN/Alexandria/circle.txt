Please take this serious.;2003-10-18 15:00:00;2 minutes;Please take this serious. My son and I seen 2 objects in the sky as we were driving home from town. I immediatly stopped to see what they were.The crafts were round to teardrop in shape , they glowed or had a shimmer of light to them. That was what caught our eye for the sky was cloudy. We obseverved them swaying , than coming to a complete stop, only for them to race off faster than the eye could see. No sooner had the objects left from our sight an airforce jet, soon raced to the area, that gave us releif in knowing that we we did observe this and it had to show on readar for the jet to arrive so soon. I had reported this on here more than a year ago but it never got posted. I want you to know that this sighting is valid and it has changed my life,after seeing something like this there are always questions left unanswered and I know that my son and I will never forget .;40.2532;-85.6712

There was a White light in the sky.  I used a camera and zoomed in. I was round like a planet.  But it was to low.  Before i caught it on camera.  It went out of the camera's view.  I looked up.  It was thereâ€¦and i watched it turn red.   Online, I did a lot of research.  No planets, asteroids or meteors.;40.2532;-85.6712

The object had orange/red lights and we didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary until the object turned immediately on its side and the lights went from horizontal to vertical. As we were driving, we also noticed it appeared to large to be a drone and also why would a drone be out so early around 1 am. After we saw it turn on its side, a few seconds later, it was gone.  We believe now that we definitely saw something that was not normal. ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary time.  PD));40.2532;-85.6712
