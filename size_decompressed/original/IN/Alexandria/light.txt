My wife, brother in law and I saw a hazy orange boomerang shaped light go across the sky over us.It was coming from the south and heading north.  It was slow moving and flying just above the tree tops.  The object should have been making a sound since it was flying so low, but it never made any kind of sound.  We was standing in the driveway talking about one of the vehicles my brother in law was working on when we saw the light.;40.2532;-85.6712
