As my son and I were driving home from a shopping trip we turned on county road 300 west,which was only 1 mile from our home. When we noticed what appeared to be two shiny teardrop crafts ,swaying back and forth with much agility . I stopped my truck as we watched them frolic in the sky darting stopping swaying it was as if the craft was on wheels ,with the precision it operated. The craft quickly left as it had came , so I contineud home . My son and I were amazed and didnt really understad what we had seen . when all of a sudden there was another craft coming from the west sky, it looked like a rocket and it was moving very fast toward us. We watched as we turned into the drive of our home and regocnized the rocket as being an airforce jet heading in the direction that we had seen the teardrop crafts. I than understood that the objects that we had witnessed had shown up on radar and the airforce was on persuit. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
