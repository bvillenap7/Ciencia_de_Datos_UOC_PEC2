To W.. suddenly, another one appeared roughly a mile east of first one with same heading.  Looking back at first one, it briefly displayed bright white lights, one at each end of cigar. The fist and second cigars gradually became too distant to see. Then looking east again, a third cigar appeared. It was also heading west, then suddenly it changed direction in a looping fashion so fast it had a trail of light.  It quickly disappeared to the east. All three cigars seemed to be about 3000 feet altitude and a quarter mile north of me and moved too slow to be fixed wing craft.  I hesitated to file report until I read other similar reports recently. I am a retired auto mechanic and dont necessarily think these were aliens.  Just something I have no explanation for.;41.2814;-86.6246000000001
