Unexplained red lights in the Indiana sky.;2017-07-01 22:00:00;<2 minutes (each);Unexplained red lights in the Indiana sky. While standing outside, I witnessed a red light in the western sky.  I thought at first that it was a plane heading towards me because it didn't seem to move.  As I waited for it to come closer, I realized that it was going directly up.  I thought at that point that it may have been a firework heading up before exploding.  That didn't happen.  It continued to go up into the sky until it disappeared.   As I told my family what I saw, we witnessed another one in the northern sky traveling east.  It disappeared as well.;41.2814;-86.6246000000001
