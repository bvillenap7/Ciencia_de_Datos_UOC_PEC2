Transparent dome with red light in middle, and flashing red lights underneath RIGHT next to the highway.;2001-09-15 21:00:00;2 min;Transparent dome with red light in middle, and flashing red lights underneath RIGHT next to the highway. Travling south bound on I65, heading back to school on my motorcycle I was scanning the sky to try and keep my mind off the cold trip that had lasted about an hour at this point. I was about ten miles out of Lafayette In. traveling twords my exit. I noticed an object in the sky at this point to my left. The highway is very dark, it was nine at night, and there are NO street lights lining the road. I first noticed the red globe of light in the middle of the object as I approached it. The object was floating VERY close to the road and quite low. It was on the other side, (North bound lanes) of traffic so I had to look across to see it. At this point I am still approaching it and think it is a red light on a tower of somesort, then I start to become horizontally in line with it as I pass, I look ,and as soon as I saw the 5 or so red flashing lights on the bottom of the craft that were flashing on and off slowly I knew what I thought I was seeing. I had a very good view of the object At this point, and so did others in the northbound lanes because I remember every car that approached the scene started braking. The object itself was about 2 to 3 hundred feet in the air and I just stared in awe. What I saw was a craft that was very dome like in appearence, the thing that was most odd was how this dome that made up 80% of the object was transparant this is how I could see the red light that never flashed in the middle. The red lights around the bottom were the same size as the one in the middle, and they appered to be attached to the saucer bottom part of the craft that the dome sat on. These lights flashed in unison at intervals of about 2 seconds. It was just like I saw on tv, it was like a movie was being played in front of me in the sky, I couldn't believe how fictonally sterotipical this UFO looked. I passed the object, kept staring and followed it until I was out of sight of it. I never saw the object zoom off, it really just hovered slightly as I was passing it anyway, no supersonic blastaways. I rac! ed to ca tch up to my girlfreind who was in my truck who was about 1/2 a mile in front of me, all she had noticed was the people braking, not the object though. I am most curious to see if anyone else that night has seen this. SOMEONE had to have, it was right by the road, I mean right next to it over the bean field. It was a very clear night I noticed the stars as I looked into the sky all the way home.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335

Size of a small house. No sound. Orange light in the south traveling north. Descended down towards me and went straight over head. Orange lighted square,orange light in the middle with illuminated orange from center to outlined square. Moved slowly, smooth and silent. Went just above the tree tops and out of sight. Maybe as big as a small house and about where a low flying helicopter would fly!;40.37946;-86.8777933333335

floating object and strange lights in the sky.;2010-08-29 02:10:00;30 seconds;floating object and strange lights in the sky. I work night shift at the Clarian Arnett Hospital as a nursing assistant. I was on my way back from getting food on my break around 2:10 am, and saw a floating object directly over the intersection in front of the hospital. It was just over the traffic lights. I stopped (at a green light) to see what it was but cannot wrap my head around what I saw. It was grayish blue, there were no streetlights just car headlights, it is very dark around the hospital, and I estimate it as being the size of a large dog. To me it looked like some sort of creature, floating silently and slowly straight up. No drifting or blowing in the wind. It had what looked like a very large head with the rest of the body which did appear to have 4 appendiges about the same size as the head, and it appeared to be almost upside down. it didnt move, just floated up as if being lifted from the sky. I turned around and went back, and it was gone. I parked in the back of the hospital parking lot and a man with a little boy were walking out to the road pointing and looking where the object had been. I walked up to him and asked if they saw it too and if they knew what it was. He said that he did, he was able to see it from up close to the hospital. But he didn’t know what it was either. It was gone. I don’t know hoe it could have disappeared so fast or whether anyone else in the cars saw it. Looking out the windows that night I noticed the moon was large, and there was a very large very bright light that stayed in the same proximity to the moon the entire night. And could see many tiny and very far away green lights appearing and disappearing and streaking the sky above. 2 of the RN’s I work with also witnessed this. The next 2 nights I’ve seen nothing and the moon is gone. I am baffled and terrified.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335

It moved from side to side amd up and down in quick motions.   Within half an hour there was 8 commercial planes that flew around it which is unusual for that many in this area.  At this time is moving south but losing visibility due to larger trees and its quickness.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335

Three of the lights were similar in shape to rounded street lights but much brighter and white, the third light was blinking extremely fast next to that light was a bright red light.  he middle of the white lights had a white hue around it similar to that of a flashlight . I at first thought it might of been a life line helicopter landing.  The closer I got to it the more it just looked off, the lights were either moving apart or the closer I got the more space I noticed between the lights.  I didn't witness anything between the light, but I saw something like a field or something around them in like a rounded rectangular shape.  It wasn't until I driver underneath it and heard my car echo similar to going under a bridge or in a tunneI decided to get out and take a picture of it or a video or some! thing because I didn't hear it and realized that it was right on top of me.  As soon as I parked my car and opened my door it was gone.  I didnt see it fly away and I don't think I heard it.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
