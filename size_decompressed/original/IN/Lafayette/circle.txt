Strange Orange light patterns in sky;2005-03-21 20:00:00;2 hours;Strange Orange light patterns in sky First off, I would like to start off by saying everything I am about to tell you is the truth and I know it sounds far-fetched.  Last night (3/21), there were very strange orange lights in the sky near the south end of town.  I currently live just south of 350 off of 18th street and am aware of the flight patterns of the Purdue students and the airport...and this had NO affiliation with that.  These orange lights were much farther away and too high to be a Purdue training plane.  These orange lights would appear for 3 or 4 seconds and then fade out to nothing.  I first noticed 1 around 8:30pm.  1 quickly turned into 2, then 3 and finally 4.  These lights would appear in a row and fade in and out at different times.  Once they would fade out, it would be around 5 or 10 minutes before they would appear again...usually in the same spots, but sometimes in different spots as well.  It was completely random...as sometimes only 2 would appear, other times just 1 would appear and again 4 would appear.  It was VERY odd and strange to see.  I tried to take pictures of this event...but was unable to capture any good evidence.  I am fully aware how strange this sounds.  I wanted to try to think of a logical explanation....and...I have come to the conclusion that I have no explanation (couldnt be a shooting star or meteor shower because there was no visual movement of these object, etc).  I would like to know if others have reported seeing this event?  Also, is there any other possible explanation related to meterology that I am not thinking of?  Again, I know this sounds crazy...but I am compelled to find answers.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335

Maybe a drone, small dark object moving in random directions, also staying still.;2014-02-22 01:20:00;Several;Maybe a drone, small dark object moving in random directions, also staying still Looked up into the sky to see the stars, then saw a really small circle looking thing going up and down, then in random directions.  Had no light, thought at first it was a shooting star, but it was moving in different directions and stopping at one place.  Ran for my mom, and she saw it too.  Shoes are covered in snow lol;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
Look like eclipse of Sun as just a slither could be seen, like something transparent covering the Sun,.  ((anonymous report));2017-10-21 08:05:00;10;Look like eclipse of Sun as just a slither could be seen, like something transparent covering the Sun, but Sun had been down for 45 mins?  After I thought about it, I thought maybe it was some odd reflection in the sky of the Sun in the West, as it was low on the Horizon also.  But the size was too Large for it to be anything but Sun, Moon, or unexplained object in sky.  I went home to get Wife and Son to see it, but it was gone.  In fact I asked my Son if there was an event he forgot to tell me about as he follows weather closely.  I am sure someone seen besides me, as roads were fairly busy at the time.  I have seen comets before, or One burn in the sky, but this was stationary and Large. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
