Orange Spheres Over Lafayette;2009-08-21 22:00:00;minutes;Orange Spheres Over Lafayette Me and a friend witnessed several orange spheres moving from west to east across a dark sky. They didn't seem to be very high and were flying in a eratic formation accept for three of them were in a slant formation similar to geese. They were moving very fast which eliminated the possibility of birds, and when they flew over us, there was absolutly no sound. we watched as they moved from east to west over us and tried to figure out exactly what we witnessed. I'm not sure what me and my friend had seen but I do know we have never seen anything like that before.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
Giant teal sphere over Lafayette, Indiana;2013-05-30 23:05:00;Very brief;Giant teal sphere over Lafayette, Indiana I was standing outside smoking a cigarette with my girlfriend. We were both looking over to the eastern part of the sky and saw a big, bright, teal-colored sphere with a foggy aura about a quarter of the size the moon would appear in the sky but lower.   The object just kind of manifested and traveled to our left in an arching trajectory then vanished.   The sky was partly cloudy, but the aura of the object didn't appear to be caused by clouds directly. It seemed to have a second layer of fogginess around it, but it's hard to describe exactly.   The object was bigger than anything I have ever seen in the sky.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
Very bright, fast moving, unrealisticly maneuvered.;2014-06-05 09:58:00;5 minutes;Very bright, fast moving, unrealisticly maneuvered. I was riding my bicycle when a light in the sky caught my eye.  I looked up and saw a very bright circular object flying through the sky.   I don't believe that it was your average aircraft because it was going way to fast, and it was manuevering in a way I've never witnessed.   And it took a very sharp turn and disappeared.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
