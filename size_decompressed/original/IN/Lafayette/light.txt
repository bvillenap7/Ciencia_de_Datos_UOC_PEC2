Two balls of light quickly appeared above our  truck then dissapeared as quickly as they appeared!;2003-03-14 20:20:00;3 seconds;Two balls of light quickly appeared above our  truck then dissapeared as quickly as they appeared! My dad and I were just pulling out of our driveway on the way to the gas-station when I heard my dad announce What the did you see that? As I looked there were two flashes of bright light--amber in color-- I then replied Holy crap!! then it was gone. Just two flashes of amber light at a very high altitude. The thing that makes this strange--to me and my father anyway--is that we live within 1 mile of an airport, and commonly see planes fly right over our house, and have grown used to it, but these happened one at a time. The only way I can explain is to draw a diagram: o o                          (FIRST ^ LIGHT) (SECOND ^ LIGHT) All within a couple of seconds. Nothing on this airport can go that fast or has that color of light. Like I said almost amber. Plus my dad can fly and work on planes. In fact just a couple of hours before I had saw a plane that had just taken off from the airport, and I happened to mention to my dad that it had two tails with a bar connecting them and he went into a speech about what this plane was (P-38) and how it was used in W.W.II. I called my best friend Nathan and he said that he thought that it was ball lightning, I don't agree. I have never believed in UFO's. Nor do I plan to. However I have always had an intrest in the supernatural and extraterrestrial. But I guess a skeptic can always turn to be a believer.

1st of 3 sightings from March 2003 to April 2004 - Orange Yellow Lights In Formation;2003-03-14 20:30:00;30 min;1st of 3 sightings from March 2003 to April 2004 - Orange Yellow Lights In Formation My husband and I were returning home from dinner in Lafayette this evening.  While stopped at a stop light at the levee heading north towards on SR 43, my husband noticed 3 small lights pretty far up in the sky.  One light came on, then another a second or two later, then the third light.  Then the first one went off and the other two followed in succession.  At first we thought - fireworks.  But that didn't make any sense because we didn't see the trail going up into the air and the lights didn't appear to fall like fireworks typically do.  We kind of blew it off.  Then about 5 minutes later - we saw the same thing again.  The lights were east of us, across the Wabash river some distance away but we didn't appear to be moving away from them.  About another 5 minutes later, we saw them again.  Then again a 4th time before they stopped which was right before we went under the overpass at I65 and SR43.  The 4th time we saw them, they appeared to be almost directly above us.  We couldn't be sure which way they were moving, but it appeared to us that they were moving north northwest.  In each occurrance, the lights were yellow/orange in color.  They would light up, then disappear in succession.  Sometimes they had smaller lights around them, sometimes, they didn't.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335

Bright stationary orange lights spotted in the North Western sky 35 miles east of Lafayette;2004-11-06 19:45:00;4 minutes;Bright stationary orange lights spotted in the North Western sky 35 miles east of Lafayette It was at night, me and 3 other friends were driving twards Purdue university (our college) from Ball State.  My friend pointed out that there were lights in the sky.  He pointed to the North Western sky, and there were 2 very bright (in relation to the airplane I saw in the sky, and the stars) stationary orange lights.  The two lights faded out, and one light appeared in the sky.  This light faded out within about 5 seconds, and about 2 seconds later another identical stationary orange light appeared to the North of the previous light.  This pattern continued 3 or 4 more times with the light fading and another reappearing in the sky to the north of it (about 2 inches apart on the windshield of the car we were in, to give an approximation of distance).  After the lights disappeared another light was spotted about a minute later in the Northern sky (much further from the previous sighting).  This light lasted about 3 seconds, and disappeared after a tree got in our line of sight of it (we were driving, and I assume that it faded out as the rest of them).  We all spotted 6 or 7 bright orange stationary lights in total.  Wether or not they were the same object or not I am unsure of (keep in mind there were two lights at first, and they both disappeared at the same time), but if it were the same object it would have to have been moving EXTREMELY fast to travel as far as it did in the sky (between lighting intervals).  There was a plane overhead in the sky at the time of the sighting which looked much much dimmer and smaller than the orange lights and which moved along at a relatively slow rate (in comparison to the distance of the lights between lighting intervals);40.37946;-86.8777933333335

One appeared on the left,;2004-11-07 00:30:00;5 minutes;Tonight we witnessed two, very bright, orange colored, lights appeareing in the north east sky, side by side. One appeared on the left, one on the right. The one on the right dissappeared, the the one on the left. About two minutes later, 3 more lights appeared horizontally in the same area. All were stationary and very bright. As one dissappeared on the right, another appeard on the left. No more than 3 were visable at a time, but 5 lights eventually appeared, all positioned horizontally.  It was odd, that afterwards, we saw what could have been 3 jets(blinking lights in the sky, followed by the sound of jets once they moved), hovering around the area. They spent approximately 5 minutes flying around the area of the bright lights, before heading south and out of the area. We saw a similar appearance last night, but the three lights were lined up vertically and we have seen the same thing numerous times repeating the same patterns since January.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335

Orange balls of light two nights in a row;2008-07-23 22:00:00;40 min;Orange balls of light two nights in a row . On 7/23/08 my wife, brother-in-law and myself were having coffee on our deck. I noticed an orange ball of light and said “Hey, what is that”? My wife and brother turned to see the OBOL (Orange ball of light) just as it was fading away. It was in the NE sky just above tree level but couldn’t tell how far away it was. We talked about it for a few minutes and we saw more lights. They didn’t move they would just fade in and stay on for about 5 -7 seconds then fade out. My wife called in to our 19 yr old son and his girlfriend and told them to come out and take a look. They both came out and we saw a set of two lights. One came on then the second. Once the second had reached its peak in brightness the first one faded out then the second faded. I said that it looked like it was only a mile or so away and I was going to drive in that direction to see what I could see. As I got over by Wainwright middle school my wife yelled into the cell phone that there was another one. I put my head between the steering wheel and the windshield of the car and it was directly above me. That one actually had a secondary light that split way from the original ball. Just before I left the house my son was getting his video camera and caught a few sets of lights on his digital video camera. He got a series of three lights just behind the tree line and the light that was over my car. The video shows the second OBOL splitting off the first one. The light I saw above my car would have bigger than my car if it had been on the ground.   I was directly under that one. There were about 6 different sets of lights that night. Some had only one, some had two and a few had three. There were 5 witnesses for the 23rd of July 2008. We saw tiny white non flashing pin lights flying all over the area where we had seen the OBOL. After we had seen the first two lights my Brother-in-law said “Look at that little white light flying after that airliner. He’s going to hit it!!!” It flew VERY fast and caught up with the airliner and fl! ew just above it until it was out of the area then peeled back and SHOT towards the east where it had came from. The very last light we had seen (I was back home by now) there we two pin point white lights closing in on the OBOL from both sides and when it disappeared the two tiny white lights shot straight up into the air nearly colliding and shot towards the north. In total there were about 4 pin lights while this was all going on. The OBOL showed up every 4-5 minutes in different areas in the NE sky. It was 22:40 when we saw the last one and went in to see if there was anything on the news. On July 24th my wife and I had to work the next morning so she went to bed and told me to wake her if I had seen anything. Right on time 22:30 the first one showed up. I ran inside got my wife and this time my daughter was home and I had her come out on the deck to watch. The lights looked the same but were in a different pattern. This time there we several lights coming on at the same time in different parts of the NE sky. On both nights if all lights would have been on they would have formed a perfect horizontal line spanning about a 5-7 mile stretch. My wife called my mother who lives in Clarkshill and her and my brother went outside and saw them. The next day I called my friend who is a police officer and he said he saw them too and had no idea what they were. So on this night we had 5 witnesses in three different parts of the county who saw them. My wife thought she saw one way off in the distance around the Delphi area, but it was too far away and she couldn’t be sure;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
A bright orange light, traveling west, then east, before gaining altitude and fizzling out of sight.;2009-07-03 23:05:00;2 min.;A bright orange light, traveling west, then east, before gaining altitude and fizzling out of sight. A friend and I had just pulled onto County Road 400 S. on the south edge of town, heading east.  As we were driving I noticed a large, orange light in the sky.  At first I thought it was an airplane or helicopter, but there were no other lights and the entire object was the same glowing orange color. We continued driving another 1/4 mile or so, watching it the whole time.  It became obvious that it was moving in a westerly direction at a fairly steady speed.  I decided to pull over and watch the object. A few seconds after doing so, it suddenly changed direction and began heading east.  My friend was able to get a picture of the object on his iPhone.  The object slowly continued east for maybe another 30 seconds while seeming to gain altitude before fizzling out of sight, possibly disappearing into a cloud. The whole event lasted around 2 minutes.  There were many people out shooting off fireworks that night, and I wouldn't be surprised if there were other witnesses.  The object was too high in the sky, too big, and too far away to be a firework.  My friend who was with me works in the airline industry and was at a loss to explain what we saw.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
White light slowly moving across sky suddenly sped off in seconds;2010-07-13 23:30:00;10 seconds;White light slowly moving across sky suddenly sped off in seconds I saw a white light that was slowly moving from my bedroom window so I closer to my window to get a better view but the light which appeared only one mile away suddenly dimmed as if it took off even further and by the time my eyes focused of the light it was gone as if it just sped off without making a sound. The white light was never flashing and was the only color observed.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
Spiraling white lighted craft or object that disappeared, no noise,..not moving at fast speed, moving east.;2013-06-19 23:06:00;50 seconds;Spiraling white lighted craft or object that disappeared, no noise,..not moving at fast speed, moving east. Upon walking my girl-friend to her vehicle around 11pm, I noticed what appeared to be an aircraft light in the eastern sky, maybe 5 to 10 thousand ft. aloft.  This object was not making any type of typical aircraft engine sounds, such as jet engines, or prop engine noise.  My girl friend noticed that it seemed to rotate, like a thrown football spiral, as it did this, the only light coming from the object was white, which seemed to get brighter with the phase of each time it rotated around, and then slightly dim as it spiraled.  We watched this object for almost a minute head east, no other strobe lights could be seen blinking, only white light.  At that point, the object's white light started to dim, and eventually went out all together, not because of it moving away I don't believe,we watched a short time longer waiting to see if it came back on, it did not.  The object was totally silent, uncommon for having an airport nearby in Indianapolis, and at Purdue Univ! ersity. Someone needs to check this area or skies out at night, not the first time seeing this.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
A long string of nearly white (towards yellow) lights moving along a line from south to north.;2013-10-19 18:45:00;5+ minutes;A long string of nearly white (towards yellow) lights moving along a line from south to north. February 24, 2014    On the evening of October 19th, 2013, at approximately 7:00 PM, we were driving south on Interstate 65, approaching Mile Marker 175, when we noticed across the horizon in front of us extending from south to north a random string of mostly white lights.  We counted over fifty in the sky at a time. Each was small in size and not connected to any others but traveling at the same speed and staying mostly within a formation.  The lights were singular, moving in the same direction and at the same speed with some minor movements and adjustments detectable, some singles, some doubles and some triples, but each appearing to move individually. It took over two minutes to reach from where each light first came into view from the south before it left our line of site to the north.  All told, we watched for more than five minutes, first stopping on the Interstate and then driving ahead to the nearest exit and stopping again in a safer location. The altitude appeared to be greater than 2000 feet but less than 3500 feet, based solely upon our experiences living in close proximity to a small regional airport for many years and witnessing many small plane take-offs and landings as well as fly arounds. There was no sound recognizable emanating from the white lights as could be detected over the sound of the vehicles on the highway. We captured two short sections of video with an iPhone which clearly shows what we were witnessing.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
Large blue light streaked across sky.;2014-08-23 23:00:00;20 seconds;Large blue light streaked across sky. Sitting outside with friends.  It had been storming all day, and the night sky was foggy. There was a large, bright blue light that streaked the sky east to west.  It was as fast as a shooting star, but much larger, or closer in orbit.  Too fast for a plane or helicopter.  Travelled in a straight path and then disappeared.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335

It got my attention  so I continued  to to watch as more lights added on coming from out of nowhere and getting in the back of the line .In there 3 minutes  or so that I watched I counted331 lights . When my uber arrived  I pointed the lights out to him .He alsofoundthem very unusual .just white round lights .There were no colored or flashing lights visible . If I had to guess from my view on the ground about an inch apart and were going from my left to the right staying at what seemed to be the same height.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
