UFO on Hwy 52;2001-09-15 20:30:00;1 Min;UFO on Hwy 52 My father and I were half way into Lafayette, after turning from Lincoln Lodge coming from Frankfort, on Hwy 52.  We both noticed an object with three corner lights and a center light flying low in the sky to our right over a corn field.  The corner lights were red and the center was white but we could not see a shape of the craft itself.  The outer lights were triangle in formation.  Most people on the hwy were breaking as well to check them out. The craft was traveling very slowly and low to the ground. It made no noise.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
strange lights at break;2006-08-02 21:20:00;4min;strange lights at break My friend and I were standing outside our plant on break when inthe NE sky we saw a light come on then within a second or two another light came on right next to it.They stayed on for about two seconds then went off. then within a few seconds they came back on but they had made a horizontal move quite a ways to the north. they stayed on about two seconds then went off. the next time they appeared they had made another horizontal move to the north came back on for about two seconds then went off and didn't come back on anymore.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
3 orange lights in a delta pattern, moving north, then north-east.;2013-06-22 22:00:00;~2 minutes;3 orange lights in a delta pattern, moving north, then north-east. As I was driving through Lafayette around 10pm on June 22nd 2013, I started to see 3 bright orange lights in a delta pattern in the sky in the direction of the moon, between clouds, south-east of where I was. It was a somewhat cloudy night, the moon was only visible on and off. At that point I was at the coordinates +40° 24' 17.18, -86° 52' 46.19.  I kept driving, and the lights seemed to be moving north. I eventually stopped and got out of the car.  I didn't hear any noise in the direction of these lights, and they soon disappeared from view behind trees.  At that time they seemed to be moving north-east. It seemed to me that the 3 lights were from 3 individual crafts.  Unfortunately I didn't have a camera with me that day.  It is difficult to estimate how high these objects were in the sky or how fast they were really moving.  They could have been as low as 300ft moving slowly, and as high as 3000ft, moving faster.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
