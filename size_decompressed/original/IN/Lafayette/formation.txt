Multiple orange lights in line then flying erratically.;2004-10-28 21:00:00;10 seconds;Multiple orange lights in line then flying erratically. I was a student at Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN, from August 2002 to May 2007.  In October of 2004, during one of the evenings just before Halloween, my roommate and I traveled to Lafayette, IN, shopping for Halloween costumes.  I was driving, and my roommate was in the passenger seat.  We were traveling due east on St. Rd. 26, and we were stopped at a stop light at the Earl Ave. intersection. I looked up at the moon noticing that it was a full moon or very close to a full moon, and suddenly there was a group of a few fire-orange lights lined up very high in the sky in very close proximity to where the moon was positioned in the sky.  I pointed it out to my roommate, and the number of fire-orange lights suddenly increased.  Simultaneously, they started flying erratically at high speeds.  They were going in every direction, and some were changing direction quickly, cutting 90-degree angles.  Some appeared to fade out and then quickly reappear a bit further away.  It appeared they were dispersing away from each other, and after a few seconds all the fire-orange lights faded. From my perspective, the event started at the lower right of the moon, and maybe 2-4 of the lights ended up on the left of the moon about 3-5 moon diameters away.  The event occurred entirely in the vicinity of the moons position in the night sky around 9:00 PM. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));40.37946;-86.8777933333335
4-6 fire-orange objects in formation turning into many more objects flying erratically;2004-10-28 21:00:00;10 seconds;4-6 fire-orange objects in formation turning into many more objects flying erratically Second time reporting.  Reporting in response to RECENT REPORTS OF RED, ORANGE, OR YELLOW 'FIREBALLS.'  Location at the time of the sighting:  driving east bound, stopped at St. Rd. 26 @ Earl Ave. intersection, Lafayette, IN.  This is a relatively high-traffic area of Lafayette many other vehicles on the road at the time. Time and date:  approximately October 28-30, 2004, around 9:00 PM.  Full or near-full moon just before Halloween. Direction and angle of elevation at which I was looking:  East, 75-80 degrees above eastern horizon, very high in the sky, in the vicinity of where the moon was positioned in the sky. Number of objects and what they did:  Initially, 4-6 fire-orange lights in a mostly linear formation, not travelling but remaining stationary, or hovering.  A couple seconds after noticing them, instantaneously, the number of lights increased as they multiplied and flew erratically at high speeds in random directions out of the linear formation.  The number of objects increased to around 12 or more.  Some were cutting sharp angles at high speeds some appeared to fade to dark then reappear further away in the general direction that they were flying when they faded to dark.  Then all the lights faded to dark, but not precisely at the same exact time.  The duration of the events that were witnessed by me totaled maybe 10 seconds. Number of witnesses present with me:  one other witness (the passenger in my car/roommate)  Other pertinent information:  Grissom Air Force Base is located in central Indiana, approximately 50 miles east-northeast of Lafayette, IN. My background:  Was a student (Aug2002-May2007) at Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, at the time of the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
