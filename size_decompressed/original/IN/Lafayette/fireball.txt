two fireballs that seemed to just disappear out of no-where;2006-06-20 22:30:00;3 seconds;two fireballs that seemed to just disappear out of no-where We were in our driveway and I was looking east at a house's roof line, talking.  It looked about 10 feet above the roof line, which I know it was higher. I saw two orange-yellow lights, one faded and then the other faded.  It happened really quick, but seemed like slow-motion. They looked like fireballs, for lack of a better word. They just were there and then disappeared one at a time.  We are storm spotters so we are used to seeing strange things in the sky, and looking in the sky most of the time, but I have yet to see something like this until now. I have heard about this from three other friends in the last couple of months, always towards the east, and this is my fiance's second sighting.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335

Bright white light flew across sky and immidiately went straight up making a J shape and disapeared;2010-06-20 23:00:00;3 seconds;Bright white light flew across sky and immidiately went straight up making a J shape and disapeared I was looking at the sky and suddenly a white bright light that looked like a comet flew downward across the sky and immediately turned straight up and made a J shape and disappeared. It was so bright that it lit up my whole backyard as if it was daylight.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
Bright orange lights over Lafayette Indiana.;2013-03-23 23:30:00;15;Bright orange lights over Lafayette Indiana I stepped outside my apartment complex cause I heard a firetruck but as soon as I walked out the door I seen three bright orange lights traveling from east to west. They where moving fairly slow and at a low altitude. After they passed the apartment the light faded out quickly. Then two more appeared, I yelled to my friend there are ufo's in the sky and a neighbor a few doors down popped around the corner and said there is more in the front. We went out front (east part of the building) and there was three more totaling eight that I had seem. They too flew west over the building and disappeared shortly after. The light just vanished and you couldn't tell anything ever happened. The neighbors boyfriend said he saw ten on his way home. It is a very clear night and there isn't a cloud in the sky. It's odd how they vanished the way they did with the clear conditions. This isn't the first sighting I've seem in Indiana but it is the first I've seen in Lafayette. I've seen them in Kokomo, In also.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
