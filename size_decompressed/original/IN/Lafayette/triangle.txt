We driving South on I-65 about an hour to an hour and a half out of Crown Point when I saw a very bright white light in the distance.  I assumed it was an aircraft but as we approached the light it moved extremely slow and was extremely low.  It made no noise.  As we approached the light we passed it to my left.  I stared out of the car window and it was in the shape of a huge triangle with many, many windows.  We passed it so quickly I was in awe.  I didn't have a chance to take a picture. I wish we could've followed it but it all happened so quickly and weren't near an exit.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
Initially observed lighted mass upon leaving south side Urgent Care and it appeared to be above or close to grocery plaza on 231. When;2018-01-30 21:00:00;5 minutes;Initially observed lighted mass upon leaving south side Urgent Care and it appeared to be above or close to grocery plaza on 231.   When we approached Alcoa on Teal we both thought there was a small plane above the factory with various lights both flashing and non but as we got closer realized it was not a small plane and it wasn't really moving.  It appeared to be hovering and although it was dark and almost 9:30 pm, we could make out a triangular shape.  The size appeared to be that of a small car in length. 5-6 ft maybe?   As we turned left onto US 52 it was no longer in sight.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
