Fast streak of light over deserted road;2003-08-25 01:00:00;1 minute;Fast streak of light over deserted road Driving east on a two way road, I saw a streak of light that zagged off to the north before disappearing from my view behind some trees.  It appeared from the west and traveled overhead before turning.  I was the only person on the road at the time and I was traveling 40 mph.  This object was much faster.;40.37946;-86.8777933333335
