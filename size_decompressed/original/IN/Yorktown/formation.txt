Formation of lights appeared in the sky, dashed away to the horizon.;2003-04-20 02:10:00;~5 seconds;Formation of lights appeared in the sky, dashed away to the horizon. Low altitude thick cloud cover, heavy humidity.  I was outside, having a cigarette with a friend, when to the north/northwest a formation of lights appeared out of nowhere above the treeline, behind the clouds.  It consisted of two longer ovals of turquoise blue light parallel lengthwise to each other, and a smaller red oval in between the blues at one end.  It hovered more or less stationary for approximately 2-3 seconds, then dashed off to the north/northwest horizon with no evident acceleration at a VERY fast speed.  There was no sound during the entire incident. I saw it appear, then dash, while my friend only looked up in time to see it streak away. 2 other friends were inside the house, and did not witness the event. It occured in a suburb of a minor midwest city, and even with the low cloud cover, we were far enough away from the city that there was no glow in the sky.  We were standing on a back porch, with a fairly bright porch light behind us.;40.1793;-85.4939
