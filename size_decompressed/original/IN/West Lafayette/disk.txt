half lit disc over Lafayette?;2005-04-16 22:30:00;15 seconds;half lit disc over Lafayette? I was driving back to work when I noticed 3 amber/orange lights in the sky to the NNE.  At first I thought it was a plane but then I realize they weren't moving at all.   Then I saw a few more lights light up for 5 or 6 total in a semi circle.  The object then proceded to rotate slightly and move to the N ever so slightly then the lights began to dissappear 1 at a time as it was rotating clockwise.   There are numerous other witnesses to this even in the Lafayette, IN area but I was the only witness from where I was at.  All reported the same thing.;40.4410337209302;-86.9236988372092
