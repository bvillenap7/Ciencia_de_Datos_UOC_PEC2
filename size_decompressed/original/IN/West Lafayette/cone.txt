I was at my telescope looking at the full moon when I took my eye away from the telescope to give my eye's a rest from the moon I looked to the west and saw three lights moving east slow. I rubed my eyes again and looked again and they where realy there.  (ha ha )  Well, I went in to grab my camera and realized my wifes was closer so I grabed her's.  When i got back outside I looked up they where there but they where getting brighter and the space between the light's were getting brighter and brighter and they where changing color from white to red blue and white.  It was triangle but cone too and seem to have a point on the front.  The size was big  about a football field in size.  Then in a blink it was gone to the east unreal speed  !!!;40.4410337209302;-86.9236988372092
