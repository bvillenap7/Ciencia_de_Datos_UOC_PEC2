2000 mph metalic oval with con trail in day time sky over Indiana.;2004-12-20 16:00:00;20 seconds;2000 mph metalic oval with con trail in day time sky over Indiana. On Monday 12/20/04 at aproximately 4 PM , I was outside in the parking lot looking at all the little puffy clouds dotting the sky.   Noticed a fast moving object  to the west.  Craft was traveling east.  I estimate it was going 2000mph.  It left a long prominent single con trail.  Appeared gold metalic with the full sun reflecting off it.  It was long oval shaped and solid.   I estimate its alltitude at about 20,000 feet.  I followed it across the sky as it moved in a straight line.   Observed the ufo for about 15 seconds or so. It never re appeared from behind a small cloud to the north east.  Could have been a scram jet???   It did NOT have wings.   Thats my story and Im sticking to it.;40.4410337209302;-86.9236988372092
