I was driving to school one morning through rolling praires along Highway 2 east en route to South Bend.  I noticed off to the left some lights in the sky. They appeared to be staionery over open field.  I kept my eyes focused on the two lights until I had passed.  The lights were side by side.  They were easy to see since the sky was dark at such an early hour.  They were so distinct.  They just sat there.  The lights were facing west and I was heading east.  I saw this twice.  I would say a week later possibly later.  The exact same thing.  Two stationery lights.  I had never been so awed.  There were no flashing lights, no random movemtents.  They looked like a set of head lights in the sky.  I have never seen anything like that.;41.7032;-86.4886
