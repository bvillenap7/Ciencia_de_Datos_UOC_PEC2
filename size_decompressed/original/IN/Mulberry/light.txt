Aircraft chasing ufo;1983-09-10 19:00:00;15 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  Despite the seemingly authoritative tone of this student's report, we believe that typical CB radio could not be used to intercept the radio communications from a military fighter.  First, the frequencies are dramatically different.  Also, military a/c may have the ability to encrypt communications during priority activities.  Moreover, if the witness was 16 years of age in 1983, it raises the question of why he might still be a student today, as he indicates.  He does not indicate that he is a university student.  PD)) Aircraft chasing ufo I'm sorry i don't remember the exact date of this, but thought it may interest you anyway. I was about 16 years old. I was waiting outside for my friend to come over. I heard the cows at a nearby farm making alot of noise and the neighborhood dogs were barking and howling. I listened to this racket for a few minutes not really thinking much about it. I looked up in the sky and saw a large white ball of light. It was moving very slow over the tree tops. It made no noise at all. I watched it for a few minutes and then ran inside to get my binoculars. When I came back out, I did not see it. My friend pulled up at that time and ran out to my backyard to see what I was doing. As I was telling him about it a military fighter aircraft came right out of the sky. It swooped over the trees, low enough that we could read the writing on the wings. We got in my buddy's truck and turned on the cb radio. We heard what we thought were two pilots. One said I can't see it it's on ! my backside another said I am dropping down to get a better look. That was all we heard. That night we saw many small lights in the sky moving around and some bright flashes in the woods. The next day I watched several large helicopters circle our property and the fields around us. This was a very strange experience for me.;40.3472;-86.6603
