Our tracks are adjacent to Lake Michigan. I was going about 15 or 20 mph preparing to stop at a signal when I looked out on the lake. I say what I thought at the time was a boat. I was wondering what a boat so brightly lighted was doing out in the lake at 4:15am. It was so evenly lit I thought it had about 6 portholes evenly light that were reflecting off the water. Before I actually got stoped I got a signal to proceed. I started picking up speed and proceeding. The lake and the boat then disapeared behind a refinery that is on the lake. I didn't think much more of it until I got on the other side of the refinery. I looked over towards the lake I saw the same thing I had seen before but It was obviously not on the because there is brush and trees so you actually cant see the lake. It was a little closer and moving as fast as I was about 25 mph. I realized that what I thought was a reflection was actually some sort of underlighting. Not very bright but noticable. This object followed me until MP 509 a period of 5 or 6 minutes. Thats when it becomes populated and you get away from the water. It flew behind a power plant and 2 Marinas. The other 2 people I was working with were sleeping. I woke 1 up and he got a couple gimpses from behind the trees at the last minute. He simply said I wish I would have been awake so I Could Have seen more I couldn't really tell what it was but it did look strange.;41.593062745098;-87.4932607843138
