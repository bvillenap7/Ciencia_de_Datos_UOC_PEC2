It was shaped rather like a pencil that has been sharpened at both ends. It was a bright, glowing yellow with two equally bright orange bands which seemed to have a few greyish-green round windows? along the bands. It was moving vertically and the craft was also vertical as if standing on end. I watched it descend and saw it through the trees. I thought it was going to land until I realized it was beyond the horizon. It took maybe 20-30 seconds. I don't know if it made a sound as I had headphones on and was looking out the window. This happened a long time ago when I was in high school. I was the only one to see it. I would have called my dad into the room except by the time I realized what I was seeing, it was gone. It was very bright in the sky on a clear night, and I remember looking at the clock and noting it was 1:00 a.m.;41.593062745098;-87.4932607843138
