Red light moving in odd manner over Hammond, IN;2012-10-23 21:00:00;1 minute;Red light moving in odd manner over Hammond, IN I was picking someone up from a meeting, and was talking to someone else when someone drew our attention to the north sky about 35 degrees off the horizon.  A red light, moving straight but irregularly and not  fast. It was pinkish red and was pulsating and fading irregularly.  It got to a point where it stopped and hovered for about 30 seconds after having moved in a way at neither rotorcraft or fixed wing craft move.  It seemed to be just below the cloud cover which was high, and likely too high to Be anything radio controlled.  After hovering it moved due north and eventually faded out of sight. 5 or six people with me saw this, and were alarmed.  I got video but it's far off and not too stable.;41.593062745098;-87.4932607843138
A group of lights moved across the sky.;2014-12-23 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;A group of lights moved across the sky. Working in a rail yard, I looked up to the horizon and saw what I thought was a group of stars.  I then saw that the mass of lights moved from the west to the east until it went behind a treeline.  The lights were moving at a rapid speed for about 2-3 minutes.  My coworker also saw the group of lights.  We grabbed our phones to video it, but the lights would not show up on screen.  A helicopter then came into the area and appeared to be following it.;41.593062745098;-87.4932607843138
