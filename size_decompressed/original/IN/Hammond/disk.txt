A floating, rolling silvery-black disk flies over the treetops in Hammond, Indiana.;2002-10-30 16:45:00;30-45 seconds;A floating, rolling silvery-black disk flies over the treetops in Hammond, Indiana. The object I saw was a silvery black disk that both rolled like a tire in the sky and floated all at the same time above the trees. It looked somewhat square-shaped with rounded edges. It was heading in a north to south direction, in a straight line, right above the trees. It was fairly small in size and compact. A non-commercial plane had just flown over the house in an east-west direction. I had looked up at the plane when I saw the object. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness on several occasions, and we found her to be seemingly quite serious-minded and credible.  She described at length her sighting on the Jeff Rense Radio talk show on Friday, November 1, 2002, and the archived radio program is available at <www.rense.com>.   ((Addendum:  The witness correct an estimate of the apparent size of the object to approximately the size of a fingernail, held at arm's length.  PD));41.593062745098;-87.4932607843138
