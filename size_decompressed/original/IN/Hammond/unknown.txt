Silent craft with 4 bright lights one red on top that floated then excelerated far and high in seconds.;2008-01-24 18:00:00;10 minutes;Silent craft with 4 bright lights one red on top that floated then excelerated far and high in seconds. My wife and I were driving home on a clear sky dark evening.A mile from home we could see a very bright lighted object in the sky. The light was clear/white. We were on 173rd st.going east.As we came to a stop sign one block from home it was floating above us heading southwest.Two round overpowering clear lights were on. As it moved closer two more lights same size came on. Now there were 4 in a row.They didnot shine down. They just kept us from making out the shape of the craft.It moved west right over us.Then in seconds took off north then southwest out of sight.Big to very high and small in seconds.It did not even seem to turn but just reversed direction. One small red light on top.No sound.Probably 5 miles in altitude and ten miles down range in seconds.The lights made it impossible to tell the shape of the vehicle.The two additional lights came on seperately like switches were thrown.This normally crosses the commercial flight path to midway and Ohare air ports in Chicago. No planes were present during this sighting.;41.593062745098;-87.4932607843138
Evening clear sky air ship with two bright lights turning on two more total four with red flasher on top.;2008-01-24 18:30:00;3 Minutes;Evening clear sky air ship with two bright lights turning on two more total four with red flasher on top. While driving home my wife and I observed a very brightly lighted object in a clear late evening sky. It was in the East,later found to be moving West.From this distance we observed a small red flashing light on top.But the front was very brightly lighted with white lights.Our sighting begin about six city blocks away. By the time we were less then a block away we could tell the direction it was heading. It stood out to me because it was heading East to West in a flight corridore that flies jet planes North to South every hour into OHare and Midway at approx. 20 to 40 planes an hour.It appeared to my untrained eye to be maybe a mile in the sky.As it begin to fly over us as we stopped at a stop sign we observed two more same sized bright white lights come on making four lights straight across.The lights were so bright no shape of the ship could be observed. I looked straight up at it only to see the four bright lights.We proceeded to make a left turn at which time we stopped and saw nothing except a distant object going West miles in altitude and several miles away. If this was indeed the same vehicle it had increased altitude greatly and air speed in a very short time. Local papers carried nothing I could find regarding the story.;41.593062745098;-87.4932607843138
Pulsating light making circles shooting out different colored balls leads to what looked like an explosion with a flume of smoke rising;2008-08-14 20:15:00;10-15 min;Pulsating light making circles shooting out different colored balls leads to what looked like an explosion with a flume of smoke rising I was driving south on highway 912 in Indiana when I saw what looked like a shooting star.  It was a white color with a long tail that was following it then  smaller different colored balls shooting off of it.  So I initially thought it may have been a firework, then suddenly it began making vertical circles and followed into a zigzag motion.  Seeing this I decided to pullover and take a better look because I was on my motorcycle.  The portion of highway I was on is raised so I had a good view over looking the buildings below easily.  When I pulled over the tail stopped and know it was a pulsating red object that was also turning white and was still shooting off balls that were colored green, purple and red they were shooting off in three's and from those balls a couple other even smaller balls were shooting off.  Then a guy in my class pulled over wondering in front of me so I pulled up to him and asked him if he saw what was looking at?  He actually pulled over to see if I needed help.  So I pointed out the light to him which was only pulsating bye now which at first he had trouble identifying at first because of airplanes in the sky. Then we  watched the light move west in a zig zagging motion along with an up and down movement with figure eights and swoops.  After about five minutes we were going to leave and it pulsated real bright and I pointed it just in time to see it drop to the ground and the sky lit up like a bomb was dropped and where it lit up a smoke flume rose into the air.  After the explosion which looked like it was about  4 or 5 miles away directly south  southeast of chicago.  The object rose back into the air dimly light at flew in a northwest direction quickly.  Then I left to go home.;41.593062745098;-87.4932607843138
