UFO in indiana.;2013-01-24 19:30:00;30 seconds;ufo in indiana My three children, i, and my mother were heading east on old Morgantown road. My mother and I were in the front seat and both spotted what appeared at first to be a large airplane coming towards us. We both started what is that plane doing that low. It was a hundred feet  above the ground and coming right at us.  We travelled about a tenth of a mile and stopped in the middle of the road. We were stunned.  The craft had five huge lights, but they were not like any lights we had ever seen. They were orange/ red in color.  Once we stopped I could make out a curved shape like a saucer shape. I could only see the part that the lights lit up.   I reached for my cell phone to get a photo and jumped out of the car. The light disappeared one my one within two seconds. I didn't have enough time to even click on my camera. I got in the car and my children and mother were yelling about this UFO. We went home, which took five minutes and I went in and looked out the back door! south. I saw the light again disappearing over the trees east of us. I would guess the distance at about twenty miles away.;39.4776;-86.4668000000001
