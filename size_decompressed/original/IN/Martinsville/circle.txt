I was watching Stargate SG1 in my family room at approximately 18:55 Eastern Standard time on 1-22-08 when I saw a bright light appear in my Half circle window that sets up 10ft to 15 feet high. The window faces dew south. The light was circular in shape as you would see a star in the sky but, much too bright and too big due to its closeness. I stared at it for about 15-30 seconds when it dimed and turned in the sky and headed upward leaving a shadow around the object as it left. Itlooked like it was an eclipse. I jumped off the couch and grabbed my jacket to see what it was. There was not a cloud in the sky and the moon was full and very bright on the eastern sky. I did not see the object again.;39.4776;-86.4668000000001
