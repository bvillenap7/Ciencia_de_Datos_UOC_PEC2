Wife and husband witness a circle of light in the night sky moves up and down rapidly, changes colors.;2012-01-25 23:00:00;?;My husband and I went to Martinsville, In, Feb 25th of 2012 to do some work on a house.  I went outside the home to smoke around 11-11:30 pm, and was just gazing at the stars.  I saw this circle of light about the same as the stars in the sky.  I thought I was seeing things when one of the stars, or so I thought, moved.   I thought that it was just the tree branches moving so I braced myself up against a post and, it moved again.  I just stared at it for awhile, and I have never seen anything move so fast in all my life!   This light, of sorts, moved left and then shot back to the right.  It done this a couple of times then, I saw it shoot straight up, then it flashed a red light, then it shot like a dart straight down and it flashed a blue light.  It started just moving to the left and right several times.  I went and got my husband,a nd he said...sure you saw a spaceship, and he laughed.  When I showed it to him, boy did his eyes get huge.   We both didn't know what we had seen, but I'm sure glad there was a second person that saw what I did.   Thanks for giving me somewhere to go with this information, cause others just wouldn't believe.;39.4776;-86.4668000000001
