My cousin and I were sitting in the car looking out, facing south direction, when in a matter of no more than two seconds a bright white elongated teardrop shaped object flew past us flying east to west.  It didn’t fly fast, but more like floated fast across of us.  I would say that it was about 13 feet high in the sky and 500 feet away, it was very close.  I don’t know the exact size of it it was very hard to tell. There was only one flying object.  The object did not look like anything I’ve ever seen before or made of anything I’ve seen before.  Almost like it was made entirely of pure energy and light, but there absolutely was something there in the core of the flying object.;41.4934;-87.3548
