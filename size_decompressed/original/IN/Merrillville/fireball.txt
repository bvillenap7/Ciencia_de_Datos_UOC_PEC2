Fireball in Merrillville IN;2011-08-05 21:15:00;2 min;Fireball in Merrillville IN Just left my house by car and immediatly noticed something strange in the sky.  Stopped the car and observed the object for about 1 or 2 minutes.  It looked like a big ball of fire just hovering there.  There seemed to be some small erratic movement and no sound.  I quickly went back to the house and got my wife to come look. When we looked back up the object appeared to be moving SW at a very high speed and disappeared.;41.4934;-87.3548
