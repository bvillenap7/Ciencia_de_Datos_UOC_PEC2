We noticed an orange colored light in the sky straight ahead so we watched it for aabout twenty min. or so and the light appeared to be in a triangular formation. A plane flew underneath the  craft and as it went under it looked like red lights appeared on it as if it were a warning. Then the craft started moving slowly at first gaining speed toward the right and then it hovered in one spot for about 5 min. Then a small star shaped object branched off of it and started flying straight up and around as if it were in orbit with the earth but still in the atmosphere. The star shaped light disappeared and we continued to watch the other object and it started moving further and further away then it disappeared. It was not a plane nor a star and i have never seen any thing like this before.;40.0503;-85.5335
