MY WIFE THOUGHT IT WAS A DRONE BUT IT MOVED WAY TOO FAST.  IT WOULD STOP IN THE SKY AND CHANGE DIRECTION AND TRAVEL APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET IN AN INSTANT.   WHAT REALLY MADE ME FEEL IT WAS A UFO WAS WHEN IT CLIMBED STRAIGHT VERTICAL ABOUT 100 FEET IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.  NO DRONE COULD MOVE THAT FAST.;39.6311;-85.8944
