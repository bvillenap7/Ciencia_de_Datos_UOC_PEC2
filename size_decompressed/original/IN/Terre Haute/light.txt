The night was very clear and the stars could be seen for miles. I got out of the car and for some unknown reason decided to look up in the sky. As I was looking into the eastern sky, I noticed a lighted object moving very slowly. I asked my fiancé to come and look at this object. She asked what it was in a very excited voice. I said, “I think it is a UFO! All of the sudden the object stopped in front of us about 10 yards away at tree top level! We were both getting a little concerned. The object or occupants in the object were looking at us maybe, but it was too far away to tell. The lighted object hovered in the same position for about 30 seconds. I was getting goose bumps and starting to perspire as was my fiancé. Then all of a sudden the object moved to the west again slowly for a few seconds and then moved out of sight in about 3 seconds! It was just like in documentaries I have seen in recent years  Now the sighting was about a mile and a half away from an airport and air guard base. However, the object made no noise at all! I know enough about planes to know that they make some kind of noise and that they do not hover like this object did and then all of a sudden move out of sight in about three seconds. I have been around aircraft since I was young and my dad was a flight engineer on a B-24 bomber in WW2. I wanted to call the air guard base, but I was afraid the airmen at the base would just laugh. However, many years ago, an F-94 from the base chased an unknown object, but gave up the chase after being outrun.  I spoke to a UFO expert about my sighting and he told me he believed that the occupants knew we were watching them and that is why the object hovered for about 30 seconds. I have gone over this sighting in my head for the past 25 years and wondered what the object was. I have come to the conclusion that it was either Air Force test vehicle or reverse-engineered object flown by our pilots OR, an alien aircraft. It was state of the art regardless of what the object was. The object in my opinion was saucer shape and very well lighted. My fiancé and I were married for about 9 years and then divorced and we had one son, now 19. He told me his mother showed him where we saw the object.  I will say that I feel fortunate to have seen a UFO. I feel like a veteran and feel that it has changed my view on life differently. I believe there was a Jesus and he did walk on water, but I wonder if there was a scientific reason he was able to walk on water. Maybe we were seeded here on earth!  I would also like to convey to you about an incident that happened to my uncle at about the same time as my experience. My uncle was a farmer in Illinois. He told me at my wedding that he was riding on his tractor one day in his field. He told me he was driving slowly and this gold metal object came up to him and his tractor engine stopped on his tractor! He said he was very frightened. The object moved around him. He tried to start his tractor to get away from the object but it still would not start. The gold metal object finally moved away and moved out of sight in a few seconds. His tractor started up again, just like other people have experience with there cars when they saw UFOs. I believe my uncle was being studied by a probe. He told me he prayed the entire time the object was studying him and that he was very frightened. I just think that it is very coincidental that my uncle and I saw these objects about the same time. It may not be. I decided to write you because I saw SEEING IS BELIEVING, UFOS with Peter Jennings last night and saw the interview with the gentleman with National UFO Reporting Center and also this is the 60th anniversary of Roswell. I hope this helps by reporting what I saw 25 years ago and I have wanted to report this for many years. Thanks You ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

White light - suddenly gone;2005-11-24 18:30:00;one minute;White light - suddenly gone I was sitting in my hot tub and looked up and saw a single bright light flying over head.  I thought it was probably an airliner, but it didn't blink different colorslike they usually do - it was a steady white light.  What is really odd is that it suddenly disappeared.  I was following its path, and it should not have been out of sight if it had continued on a direct path.  Very odd.  Do not know if anyone else is seeing something and then not seeing something.  It is really only noteworthy due to its sudden disappearance and lack of similarity with other aircraft lighting.;39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585
Decending bright white light in the sky lasting for 45 minutes visible from the midwest USA in the PM.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??

Earth Coordinates  Latitude	39.4669°  Longitude	-87.3781°  February 21, 2007, February 22, 2007, Bright Light visible from these coordinates between the hours of 20:00 and 20:45 descending steadily from 145 degrees elevation with respect to the earth’s horizon down to the horizon.  Bright white light alternating sporadically from white to red then back to white.  1/20th as bright as an eighth moon and 5 times brighter than an air plane landing lights.  Similar in nature to a satellite in motion which are normally barely visible to the naked eye if visible at all.  The main difference between a satellite and this is the amplitude of brightness and the alternating color.  One other similarity to a satellite is the cyclical nature in which it appears.   One way or another, this is an extra terrestrial object.  I have spent a reasonable amount of time tracking satellites which are tracked and publicized as visible from these coordinates.  Having been unable to identify a man made object in this orbit which emits this type of light I have no choice but to classify this as a UFO sighting.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??

I WAS SAYING THE LORDS PRAYER AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I SAW A SMALL WHITE ROUND LIGHT MAKING AN ORBIT AROUND THE LOWER RIGHT QUADRANT OF THE MOON. ONCE IT LEFT MY SIGHT ANOTHER ONE CAME, BUT GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION, BUT APPEARED TO BE ORBITING A DIFFERENT PATH ALSO. THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EITHER THE SAME ONE OR A SECOND ONE. WHEN I SAY ORBIT- I MEAN IT CAME FROM BEHIND THE MOON 1/3 THE WAY IT DIAMETER AND LOOKED AS IF IT WENT ACROSS THE LOWER RIGHT QUADRANT THEN DISAPPEARED. THE SPEED WAS FASTER THAN CONCEIVABLE. I DO NOT HAVE EYE PROBLEMS. IT HAPPEN AS I WAS SAYING THE LORDS PRAYER. I ALSO GOT THE FEELING I WAS BEING SHOWN SOMETHING ABOUT HOW BIG GOD REALLY WAS. GETTING NEARER TO CHRIST'S BIRTHDAY, I HAD A FEELING OF KNOWING THAT HE WAS REALLY SENT HERE FROM THE HEAVENS- IF YOU GET MY DRIFT. MAKES ME WONDER IF THE NORTHERN STAR WAS REALLY A UFO WATCHING A VIRGIN BIRTH OF THE LORD WHO WAS HERE TO SAVE US ALL. BY THE WAY, I AM A REGISTERED NURSE AND NOT REALLY ALL THAT RELIGIOUS.

A very bright point of light seen in north sky.;2010-04-05 23:55:00;15-20 seconds;A very bright point of light seen in north sky. Sighting, first week of April 2010  On the night of April 5th 2010 at about midnight, give or take 10 minutes, I was going to bed when I noticed a bright ruby red light to the north of my home. The window beside my bed looks to the north and I have a clear view of Polaris just over the neighbors’ tree.  I am in the habit of looking out at the sky just before I lay down, sort of a last look around the neighborhood. On this night I saw a point of red light slightly lower than Polaris and slightly to the east of the star. With my arm out stretched the light was just over my thumb’s width East of the star. The sky was clear and visibility was good. The light was very bright and looked almost like a laser pointer aimed directly at me.  It was motionless and held its position from the time I noticed it until about 15 seconds later when it just went out. This was followed by a just as strange “Puff” of green light. A second or so after the red light went out there was a halo like flicker of light that reminded me of a light seen pointing away from you in a fog. It was as if something was in the way of the source of the green light and me. All I saw was the light that washed around the object.;39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585
Bright red light moving over Terre Haute ,Indiana;2014-06-20 22:50:00;~4 minutes;bright red light moving over Terre Haute ,Indiana At about 10:30 pm I went out with one of my dogs on our front porch.  Looking to the North (across the street)I saw a bright red, constant, light.  The light was just above the house across the street and appeared to be getting closer.  It appeared to be heading pretty much South with a few degrees to the east.  This was not an airplane or helicopter! I quickly went in and got my wife to witness this.  She also saw this bright light.   Just before it was directly overhead it faded and took about one full minute to fade out of sight. It almost appeared to fade due to the light source possibly being at an increasing angle to us, much like a passing cars headlights.  I have seen an orange light during the daytime a few months ago and told my wife about it.;39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585

Main light was bright but soft/warm with a deep amber/orange light that was infront of or part of the main light.   Shapes were not clearly visible but there was something other than the light that the light was attached to/part of that traveled in a West/ Northwesterly line.  First impression was a plane too low and going to crash but there was no sound.  Went quickly to window and saw only a lone helicopter in the eastern sky at a much higher altitude flying in a line that was slowly curving around our general vicinity.

They appeared to be less than a mile away about 500 feet high, and the lead grouping was several red, and a couple of white lights.  The all white group of lights that were about 50 feet behind and below, were moving at the same speed and direction.   Couldn't see if it was a large craft or two, but it sure freaked us out.

Four unidentified moving flashing lights that hovered in place for several minutes.

Terre Haute, Indiana At first, I thought there were two planes, flying too close to each other, so I watched them. There was no sound from the objects.  The objects were flashing white lights and at first moving quickly to the south of me in a westward direction.  Then the two flashing lights came to a stop and hovered in place.  I scanned the sky and noticed two more flashing lights that were hovering in place nearby, to the East of the other two flashing lights.  As I watched, the first two flashing lights that I saw suddenly went dark.  The other two flashing lights to the East, continued to hover in place for two - three more minutes and then went dark also.

Four points of light appeared one after the other, one with a quickly-disappearing light trail, half an hour before nightfall.;2020-10-07 19:35:00;unsure;Four points of light appeared one after the other, one with a quickly-disappearing light trail, half an hour before nightfall. I am a 22-year-old white female college student studying English and Creative Writing. (Hopefully any talent I have in the field will aid in this description.) I wouldn’t exactly call myself a conspiracy theorist, but I am openly receptive to the idea that there are things among us that we don’t understand. I don’t know if this is pertinent, but I have a background of depression and anxiety, though I was experiencing neither during this event. (Up until I saw the UFO. Then, I will admit, I was very anxious.)  At approximately 19:30 on October 9, 2020, I was sitting alone in my car in a McDonald’s drive-thru on the north side of Terre Haute, Indiana. The sun was setting, but it was still bright out the sky was a pastel pink. As I waited for the cars ahead of me to move on, I noticed what looked to be two stars hovering in the west—the direction that I was facing. They were bright white pinpricks of light contrasted against the sky. It’s hard to say the shape, simply because they seemed so far away. Upon closer inspection, I could see that at least one of them had a short trail, and in an attempt to reconcile the strange object, I told myself it must be a couple of planes, despite the fact that planes do not emit light in that way.  (The trail was odd looking, too. Not smoke, but it appeared to be made of light.)  The drive-thru line was not long, but long enough for me to stare for a minute or two. Long enough to have noticed any movement, or a direction in which the “planes” were heading, if there was any. But they simply hovered, completely still. The trail that had been left by the one had dissipated in a matter of moments. I pulled out my cell phone and attempted to take pictures, but the points of light were too small for my camera to pick up. At this point, I suspected that it might be a UFO, but had other explanations to put myself at ease, as well. I knew that Mars and Venus were supposed to be bright this month—perhaps that was all I was seeing.  However, as I was focused on the original two points of light, two more appeared. I first noticed the third, and then as my gaze shifted, a fourth. All close together, and all unwaveringly still. I distractedly pulled forward to the pickup window, and accepted my bag of food before pulling out of the parking lot and heading home.  I took Fort Harrison Rd west toward 13th St and continued to anxiously watch the points of light (what I even now struggle to call UFOs) as I drove. So intent on watching them in fact, needing to track any movement and at this point terrified of what it might mean, I was not as focused on the road as I should have been. I made it back to my home in one piece, but only after I told myself to look away and pay attention to what I was doing. I wanted to look around at the other drivers on the road, to see if they were reacting the same way, if they even noticed, but my mind was scattered, and I was far too anxious to do anything but race home.  The moment I arrived back at my house, I headed to the back yard to get a clearer view of the sky, but there were too many trees blocking my view, so I went back in. Sat down. Feverishly Googled what it could be, and found with a blossoming dread that it couldn’t be Mars and Venus. Not only are those planets located in different quadrants of the sky, but are visible only at different times of the day. Perhaps one of the lights I saw was Mars, but that doesn’t explain the other three.  Later that night, I did further research, and was momentarily relieved to find there would be a meteor shower that same night, but the details about the meteor shower didn’t line up with what I saw. According to a local news site, the Draconid meteor shower is small, and one should only expect to “see a few meteors streak across the sky in an hour.” And though the Draconid meteors move slower than those in other showers, they only last “one or two seconds,” which does not account for the several minutes that these UFOs were in my line of sight.  And these could not be stars. Even neglecting the fact that one of them had a trail, nowhere within city limits could you see stars shining that brightly, especially before nightfall. Truly, I would like for there to be some other explanation. But the more I go over the memory of what I saw, the more I’m convinced that the only logical explanation is UFOs. I relayed this experience to a trusted friend who used to live in Arizona, a well-known hub for UFO activity, and she told me that my description matches that of her own experiences. I did a few different Google searches to see if anyone had reported anything similar, but I came up empty-handed. So I decided I had to do it myself, even though thinking about it fills me with that same dread as before.  I don’t think I’ll be getting any sleep tonight.;39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585
