Glowing Arrowhead Shape Craft with Glowing white Trail;1984-07-25 04:00:00;1 hour;Glowing Arrowhead Shape Craft with Glowing white Trail I worked until 2 a.m. at my job, outside city limits. We also lived outside the city limits at this time. Getting home, I turned on the TV for relaxing. Around 4 a.m., I felt I could finally go to sleep. My cat wasn't in the house and fearing the roaming dogs, I went ouside to look for it. I went out the back door, which faces east, walked around to the front, which faces west, looing down at the ground, under shrubs, etc. for the cat. The cat was out front under a bush and as I bent down to pick it up, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a bright white light light in the sky, which my mind said was the crack of dawn. Then as I fondled the cat in my arms, I realized that dawn would appear out in back, or the eastern sky, and this was west. I looked up at the southwest sky. There was a thick bright white trail, solid without separation waves, that a jet might leave. We have 3 big 'cedar type' trees in the front yard so I shifted my looking past the 2nd. tree, saw more of the trail, then past the 3rd. tree, saw more of the trail but followed it with my eyes to the north west sky. I was dumbstruck, startled to see an arrow head shaped object, glowing a brilliant white as with an enormous amount of heat,  at the head of the trail. It was moving slowly, as if encountering a force. It went on beyond my sight. The trail was still in tact and visible when I finally went inside. The object might have been heading towards Chicago... or beyond. It was huge, even from the distance. I'm sure it was as high as the commercial jet planes that fly over our house. A few years later, I read the front page of a 'scandal rag' type newspaper while waiting in line at a supermarket. It had an interview from a physcic who told about this object and another incident I'd seen, a storm where a huge black storm cloud hung over a power plant and lightening produced a constant stream of what looked like Hebrew letters. I too, saw that, from my workplace window. This physcic said a young man in the midwest had video taped that cloud w! ith hebr ew writing in it. So, guess I'm not the only one who saw both things. I was working at this business place from 1976 to 1986. By 1985, the cat in this note had disappeared and I had acquired other cats. I have vet. papers for all my cats but have never looked up ones for the cat of note to pinpoint date closer. I know it was July 25th for sure because I noted it was my sister's birthday. Lastly, the object was not chevron shape nor triangle so I said other because it looked exactely like an arrow head, with the notch in bottom center. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
