November 16, 1999 - Large meteor/fireball  sighting in Indiana, folloed by UFO sighting later that evening.;1999-11-16 19:05:00;10-15 seconds;November 16, 1999 - Large meteor/fireball  sighting in Indiana, folloed by UFO sighting later that evening. I was walking back to my dorm at Indiana State University at around 19:05 when I looked up between the buildings in front of me and saw a very large fireball that was bright green in the center, and had a tail of orange flame that moved relatively slowly across the sky in front of me.  It looked to fly directly over our campus, west to east, but it was fairly impossible to tell just how large or how high up it was.  It really freaked me out though...  There were about 10 other people within 100 yards of me on campus that noticed it too, and I heard loud yells of astonishment coming out of the windows of the dorms on campus near me (apparently they saw it too...).  Unfourtunatley, I had a limited field of view because of the surrounding buildings, but started to run to try and get a clearer view once it went behind a building, but couldn't get a clear view.  I later heard on the radio that the object had been seen around town, and was being explained away by local authorities as space debris on the radio.  It was a very big, very dramatic fireball, the likes of would never have imagined.  Later that night, I went with a friend to an observatory on top of one of the classroom buildings to try and see some of the Leonid Meteor action that was supposed to be taking place that night.  After being there for about a half hour, we were standing next to two older couples who were up there for the same reason.  One of the ladies suddenly said loudly, what is that?!  I looked up and after searching for an instant, I saw to my utter amazement a trianguler shaped object with no lights move silently overhead.  The clear night was disturbed by only a few very wispy and insignificant clouds at what looked to be about 2,000 plus feet, and the object just happened to catch my eye because of its movement, but my friend, and the other three older people couldn't spot it.  It was relatively the same shade as the night sky, and again, had no lights on it.  Well I felt like Iw as frozen, I was so surprised by the whole e! xperienc e.  I watched the object for a good 15 seconds before it disappeared above some of the low-level clouds that I mentioned, and was heading from north to nearly due south.  It the single most shocking-awe inspiring thing I have ever witnessed in my life.  To describe the craft in more detail, again, it was triangular in shape, and moving point-forward.  It had molding or cross-beams underneath that met in the center, and extended straight out to each of the three triangle points.  I am extremely familiar with military and civilian aircraft, and wasn't anything I've ever seen or even heard of.  It was completely foreign.  And, again, possibly the wierdest and most disturbing thing was the fact that it had no lights, and flew SILENTLY directly overheadat what appeared to be no more than 4,000-5,000 feet i'd estimate.  I know this sounds nuts, but I swear that it's absolutely true.  TO the say the least, it was one interesting evening.  First, the unbelievable fireball object, and then the UFO that I saw at the observatory.  And the fact that I wasn't even the first one to see the UFO helps me to be able to assure myself that, yeah, this really happened.  I will remember it for the rest of my life.

They got real close and started to change color.;2005-02-25 21:00:00;about an hour;They got real close and started to change color. I was talking to a friend of mine outside my house smoking and talking about anything that came to mind. When I saw a guy across the street from my house was looking at something in the sky so I looked to see what he was looking at. We saw four fireballs in the sky about a mile or so in the sky. They seemed to be playing with each other, that lasted for about 45 minutes, and then it seemed like they knew we saw them and they got real close and started to change color and then it was like someone just put the fire out they were gone.;39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585

When they met, there was a huge burst of orange, like a fire in the sky. Something orange caught my attention at about 9:30 pm.  At first I thought it might be an airplane, but a few seconds later, I saw another small orange light headed toward the first.  As the two got closer to eachother, they became brighter orange and cone shaped.   When the two met, there was a burst of very bright orange/red light, almost like a fire.  The burst was large and lasted about one minute and then completely disappered.   It wasn't like an airplane crash, there were no falling debris and there was no sound.;39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585

But it looked like something on fire streaking through the sky.  It was just like watching a plane go by but with no noise and whatever it was it was on fire.  By the time we got the camera outside and ready it had went further away and just kind of dimmed out.;39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585
