UFO tampreing with comunication towers in Terre Haute, In;1974-01-15 05:00:00;20 min;UFO tampreing with comunication towers in Terre Haute, In I was about 13 and had a morning paper rout. It was on a sunday evrly morning. I had gotten up to see if the newspapers had arived (so that I could start on doing the inserts and folding them for delivery). I looked out the front door wich faced west and could see a number of comunications towers (WTHI tv and radio, what was then WIIL tv,as well as three other radio antena,s).There was a craft hovering next to the top of boath the tv towers. As I watched them the one farthest away (at the WIIL tower) moved (didnt realy see it move but it did) to the next tower in the line-up I think it was thr WPFR tower. where it hovered. a moment later the one that was closest to me(at the WTHI tower) moved to the tower that the other object had just left. They proceded in this fassion untill they had paused at eash tower in my view and i would guess went to other towers in their path. I reported this to my parents who said that they had been listening to the local,sheriff,and state police depts. talking about them on the scanner.Even tho Hulman Field did not send any responding aircraft. Wile this was giong on I was unable to move (i wanted to get the camera but couldn't).The event is still etched in my mind as if it just happened.I know others have seen the same thing yet have not been able to find any other reports. Hopefully this will bring them out. I Have also witnessed another where a small red ball was next to a direct tv antenna that was just installed.there was a friend with me at the time who saw this instance  as well.
