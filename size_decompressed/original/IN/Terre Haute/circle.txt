Smoke ring type cloud seen moving rapidly north;1975-08-15 23:00:00;1-3 min.;Smoke ring type cloud seen moving rapidly north While east bound on US40 approx. 12 miles east of Terre Haute I saw a car parked in the west bound lane and the driver standing in the road. It was a bright moon lit night and a cloudless sky. No noticable wind. From a distance I could see the driver looking upward. I looked up out of the windshield and saw a cloud moving rapidly to the north. I stopped some 1000 feet ahead of the other car, and got out and looked upward. The cloud was a circle like a smoke ring. It was moving quickly and stars could be seen through the circle. The cloud was dark below as if the cloud was very dense, and the edges seemed to curl upward as if wrapped around something. It went from south to north smoothly and with no distortion as a cloud might have in a wind. My girl friend was yelling for us to leave. Some years later I saw an article in a local paper with the other drivers story of the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We would like to have the article sent to us we would like to post it.  PD));39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585
FAST AND LOW CROSSING.;2004-05-08 04:17:00;5 seconds;FAST AND LOW CROSSING. I was facing SE, before first seeing a dim-white circle moving almost due south over my head. It was silent and low, but not close enough to say for certain if it was a sphere. At arms length,the size was a thumb nail to the sky. I did have sense that it must have been lower than 500 feet because as it passed me it's straight path, deviated in a fast wavering zig-zag motion. Perhaps in a scanning observation of me.;39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585

It was approximately 30ft in diameter with bright lights on the bottom hovering 50ft over the ground. Once the van was stopped a low rumbling sound could be heard. The craft hovered slowly over the vehicle and rapidly disappeared.;39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585
Bright light in sky in Terre Haute, IN just west of Hulman airport at approximately 2:15 a.m. 7/14/2012;2012-07-14 02:15:00;2 minutes;Bright light in sky in Terre Haute, IN just west of Hulman airport at approximately 2:15 a.m. 7/14/2012 My wife and I were heading east on U.S. 40 (Wabash Ave.) at approximately 2:15 a.m. in the morning and turned south (right turn) onto U.S. 46 (actually east for the road, but officially heading south).  As soon we turned the corner, there was a very bright light, appeared to be just over the tree line in an area that is over a field and just west of Hulman Airport.    We were both asking one another the question, What in the heck is that? It stayed perfectly still like it was sitting on a light post and then about the time we get to the intersection of U.S. 46 and U.S. 42 it takes off south.  In my mind, I thought it was like a firework, it took off quickly, but was way too big for that.   Also my recollection was that after about 500 feet, I thought it went down, and I was actually waiting for something to explode, it did not.  My wife said she saw it go several miles away turning into a small dot almost instantly. We were both in awe at this point and kept driving toward where it was and when we got to that point, there was still a trail of smoke that was about the 500 feet (guessing), then it disappeared.   It was a very clear night.;39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585

The number of pulsing went from a solid light to starting to a few slow pulsations to progressing to more and faster rhythm of strobing flickering to about 20 per second.  It was apparently watching the same fireworks to our north, then it moved Eastward low on the horizon.  I was looking for an airplane type of red and green light but it was definitely not conventional, unless it was a drone pretending to be an UFO.  Distance is hard to tell but I live about 5 miles South of the city, so even with the distraction of fireworks, it still should have been seen by many people.  Thanks for filling this report.  It was certainly very strange and peculiar.;39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585
Unidentified Non-Drone Object;2021-04-10 21:45:00;1 minute;Unidentified Non-Drone Object It was a clear non windy evening at near dusk last Saturday. As I was traveling about a half mile of where I live in the country in the southwestern part of Vigo county outside of Terre Haute IN, I saw what I first thought was a peculiar looking drone flying over the big farm field near the corner of Curry and Sullivan moving West. The colors and size as it approached me was too different to what I have ever seen so I quickly pulled over my car and opened my car door for a cellphone picture. I then realized it was aware of me as it quickly changed direction moving back East. It had a circular rotation of the center four lights that turned independent to it's flight path. I couldn't hear any sound as it slowed down from maybe at most 30 mph to almost stationary observing me taking pictures. All were blurry except for the one I will send you. The photo has the same two colors of bright neon like Pink and lite Blue. The two rectangular Pink in the front were po! sitioned lengthwise and the other 2  behind them were lite Blue and also lengthwise but smaller. For some reason the photo merges the other lights in the center but you can still see the same colors and circular shape. I had to leave because there was a car coming from the intersection nearby as I was outside of my car, so I left. I did some searching on available drones for sale and nothing that I can find remotely looks like that. Also it's hard to judge distance but I would say it was about a 100 feet high at it's closest to me and would have been bigger than any drone, about 10 feet wide at most. So I definitely think it's some other type of unidentified intelligence for sure!;39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585
