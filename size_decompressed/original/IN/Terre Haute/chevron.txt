FOUR LIGHTED CHEVRON SHAPE SILENTLY GLIDES SOUTHWARD!;2004-12-05 04:25:00;5 seconds;FOUR LIGHTED CHEVRON SHAPE SILENTLY GLIDES SOUTHWARD! I'm estimating a couple miles east of me, passing silently to the south I had a very clear sighting of an unknown craft. Probably around 60 degrees from the horizon, was four lite white spheres in a chevron pattern without any solid structure visible. Size at arms length about 2 inches viewing from a side profile, would likely have been twice as big from a front angle.;39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585
Succession of sightings chevron was 5 times higher than it's lower counterpart, both of them big and silently fast.;2005-03-06 05:07:00;7 seconds;Succession of sightings chevron was 5 times higher than it's lower counterpart, both of them big and silently fast. Early in the morning, two hours before sunrise, I had the first of two significant sightings of something silent and unknown grand proportions.  At 5:07 am, off to my left from the north appear 5 lite-white lights in a chevron or half oval shape.  At arms length about 2 inches wide move due south, from about 45 degrees above horizon to around the same angle south. It crossed roughly 90 degrees of space in  at most 7 seconds, before going out of view.  I know this because of unsuccessfully trying to videotape it upon audio playback of my description. I also realize that estimating altitude is unlikely to be very accurate, when you get past a few hundred feet because of the given unknown size involved-even with tall trees for a background. However because I have a further reference to a similar object much closer at around 200 feet, using the length of my side yard as a close comparison. the first sighting would be close to 1000 feet because it was five times smaller in relative size. Weather conditions: clear but humidity was 90% and temperature was seasonly cold at 28 degrees but without much wind. the subsequent encounter was much closer,I believe to be the same type of craft happened at 5:12, just 5 minutes later-of which I will file in a separate follow up report.;39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585
Double lighted chevron type object passes directly over me in succession- fast and low with no visible structure.;2005-03-06 05:12:00;5 seconds;Double lighted chevron type object passes directly over me in succession- fast and low with no visible structure. Facing towards the east, laying on my back, 5 minutes later than the first reported sighting at 5:12am came another unknown object also from the north.  To describe it as precisely as I can, At arms length two amber-whitish lights were about the size of a half-dollar on both sides of the craft, about 10 inches apart. My hands are 8 1/2 inches long, so I feel conservatively confident concerning the size.  In regards to the structure, I couldn't see any visible shapes connecting the spheres. It caught me slightly off guard. No sooner than I could look left, this object silently swoops downwards moving south passing directly over me, when I put my eyes into the eyepiece of my camera It was already over my head. Then veering southwestward beyond the trees and over my house before losing sight of it in 5 seconds. Using the same size-scale as in the prior chevron sighting with five lites, I would surmise that it's very likely that this would be the same object having all three center lights off, and an altitude of within 200 feet. As incredible as it seemsI would further add that it's far too coincidental of the timing and the speed of direction unless the first chevron during it's surveying, instructed the second object to come down for a closer cross scanning over me.;39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585
