I say this for 2 reasons, as it shifted in a direction directly between the trees in front of me, about 60 feet away, and most importanly, in an instant stopped then accelerated 3 times, in about as many feet. As I sat up looking, either it moved faster than my eyes could track it, or it seemed to vibrate or shimmer losing it's round shape while in motion. Afterwards resuming course to the SE. Even though it was very small for it's altitude. Using tangent at 65 degrees 50 feet away at ground level=107 feet high. The size was a thumbsnail at arms length. humidity 90% 59 degrees f. However the upper air vapor in the upper stratosphere was quite dry. This is my first sighting since the first part of march 2000. ((NUFORC Note:  One of two sighting reports from same source.  We do not understand how anyone would be able to determine distances, altitudes, and angles with the precision implied by this case.  PD));39.4565071776155;-87.4002894160585

About the size of a thumbnail at arms length, was a lite white sphere or disc shape. there was definitely depth to it, whether it was as high as it was wide, I can't say. Except as it slowed as it passed the color from the side angle changed to amber. Moving from the west it turned towards the southeast, slowing and speeding up back and forth 3 times in an observing fashion, before going beyond the trees out of sight.
