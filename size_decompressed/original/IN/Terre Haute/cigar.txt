We saw three cigar shaped objects fly over Indiana University.  It is possible that the object abducted someone (Jake Kelley).  Lighter were flashing on the object and it left a trail.  There was a haze around the object and it emitted other smallest objects and light beams along its flight path.  The objects changes colors and then landed, making weird electric sounds as it went.  There were four military blimps chasing after the UFO, but because they were blimps they never caught up. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.
