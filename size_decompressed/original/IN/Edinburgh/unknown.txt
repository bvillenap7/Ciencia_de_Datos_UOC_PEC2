Unusual Black Craft near Edinburgh;2004-04-17 12:26:00;(was driving);Unusual Black Craft near Edinburgh  It was around 12:30 in the afternoon as I was heading back to Indianapolis. As I was driving north on I-65, I saw a black and shiny aircraft off the side of the freeway. It held an altitude of about 800 to 1,000. At first, I thought it was to be a helicopter because the way it was shaped, but I noticed no propeller of any kind. It also amazed me as it turned sideways. As it turned, it looked 2-dimensional, and then into a bright star for a split second after. I don't think the bright shine on the craft came from the sun because the light seemed to be emitting very brightly than that of a reflection. After noticing the craft fade away in the sky, I continued driving away. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));39.3595;-85.9725
