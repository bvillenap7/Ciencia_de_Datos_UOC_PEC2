I was looking off towards the West when I heard a sound like something hit the ground to my right. The sound was that of when you drop a baseball on the ground. I turned to the North and thought that since nobody was around that maybe something fell from the sky. I then looked up and I saw a very large stationary ,round and bright light in the sky. It was a clean white light, like that of the moon. It seemed as though the light was focused on me but I didn't see a light beam like you would expect to see from such a bright light. Then after approximately 3 seconds of looking at it, it looked like it flipped upside down and shot straight up in the sky at the fastest rate I have ever seen anything move before, and disappeared from view.;41.3479;-85.1398
