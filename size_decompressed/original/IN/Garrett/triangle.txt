Suspect UFO sightings on Tuesday September 30, 2008 and Wednesday October 1, 2008. Time frame: between 10 -11pm both nights  Sky conditions at the time: very clear Tuesday night and some, but not many, clouds on Wednesday night. Could see constellations very clear on both nights. Viewed by: Myself, wife, daughter and our neighbors next to us. Could see with the naked eye and binoculars. Appearance: a domed pyramid shape with an array of colored lights (blue, green, red, white and yellow). Was in the same area of the sky both nights. Movement: mostly stationary with every once in a while a short jog to the right and then back to the left. Would stay in the same spot for approximately a half hour and then would finally disappear over the tree line. Unusual circumstances: normally you would see maybe a couple of airplanes, at night, and be able to hear them. Both nights had approximately 20 to 30 other aircrafts in the sky with only a couple that you could hear their engines running, the others made no sound. The aircrafts would head in the direction of the suspect UFO and would go above and below it and circle around it. On Tuesday night after the suspect UFO was out of site, 10 -15 minutes later the sky grew very cloudy (like an upper fog had moved in) and it started sprinkling. On both nights after the suspect UFO was out of site the aircraft traffic dissipated to only a couple visible.;41.3479;-85.1398
