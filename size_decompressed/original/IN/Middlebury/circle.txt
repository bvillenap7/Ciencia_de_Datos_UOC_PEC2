I saw one in the same area on june 21 and had my camera with me.  I video recorded it for 20 seconds, and it was moving north and disapearing. No sooner than i took off i saw another one coming from the same direction.  I quickly pulled off the road and video taped it again.  It moved north until it was not visable.   A few seconds later another on came from the same area that the last one did and moved at the same steady speed.   I continued taping and and have several photos also.  I followed it as it went north until it started flickering like a yard light that is slowly turning off when it's getting light out.  It may have been moving into clouds but it suddenly reduced its size from lets say a zero to a period and also turned white at that time, and within two seconds disappeared. I saw the same thing in goshen the night before except it moved straight up until it disapeared.  To the west were about 5 or more somewhat close together and moved at different speeds at an upward angle, then disappeared.  I also have some photos and short video of them also.  I have never seen anything like this before, and have no explaination for it.  I blew up the pictures and brought up the exposure and do not see any sign of a physical object around the glowing light.
