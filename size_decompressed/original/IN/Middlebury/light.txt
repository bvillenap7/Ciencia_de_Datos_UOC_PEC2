Two orange red ball of light seen by 5 factory workers in Middlebury, IN.;2012-09-26 21:00:00;~2 minutes;Two orange red ball of light seen by 5 factory workers in Middlebury, IN. Four coworkers and myself were standing outside of our factory on our lunch break. We were having a conversation when one of them pointed and said, It's a UFO!  There were two reddish orange balls of light traveling Southwest. They were probably a quarter of a mile away from us, if that. We thought at first it was a very low flying prop-plane, but as it came closer, there was no sound and at one point the lights were vertical of each other.  They appeared to move in tandem, rotating about 270 degrees counter clockwise, then slightly back.  After that, one fizzled away, and the other disappeared to the South.   I captured the sighting on my iPhone and will be uploading to youtube within a day with the title, &quotUFO in Middlebury, IN&quot;41.6786;-85.7086
