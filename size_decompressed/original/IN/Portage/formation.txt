I noticed around 16 red orbs flying in formation in the northeast.  These craft were forming angular patterns and zig-zagging around the sky at a slower speed changing formation several times.  A couple other people had noticed these orbs and were taking to themselves about it.  I noticed sometime after driving that the orbs were begging to disperse.  They made no apparent sound.  They were also at a high altitude.  The patterns seem to have been purposely made.  No plausible explaination.

Large display of lights in an angular pattern switching position periodically.  Red in color and orb shaped.   The crafts then dispersed into different directions after about 20 minutes.  At least 16 orbs were seen over a residential area.   Could be latterns, but it's highly unlikely.   People in a parking lot were also visually witnessing the orbs also.
