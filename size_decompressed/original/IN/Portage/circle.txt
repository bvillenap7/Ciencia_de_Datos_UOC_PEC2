Reddish ball flying in the sky.;2014-10-25 16:50:00;5 minutes;Reddish ball flying in the sky. Me and my kids were outside in the back yard when we noticed a bright reddish ball flying thru the sky.  It was traveling slow but lost sight of it when it went below to tree line.   Seemed close but I'm sure it was far away.  Not sure what it was but i have never seen anything like that before.;41.5681;-87.1749
