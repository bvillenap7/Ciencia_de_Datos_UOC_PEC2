Silent, orange glowing object below the clouds traveling SW to NE.;2010-07-04 21:09:00;1 minute;Silent, orange glowing object below the clouds traveling SW to NE. We attended a back yard BBQ and fireworks display at a family members house on July 4th, 2010.  The group was sitting against the house on lawn chairs as the fireworks began.   At 9:08pm A person pointed at a light heading from the SW to the NE.  We could all plainly see in the distance. It was a steady, orange glow.  There was no noise.  It didn't have any blinking aircraft lights (we watched aircraft fly over the area most of the evening).  It was below the clouds. It was moving at a steady speed.  From what we could tell it didn't change direction and for what I could tell went with the wind.  My wife mentioned that she and some other people saw the same light earlier in the evening in the same approximate path but didn't mention it until the second sighting.  I was videotaping at the time it was sighted the second time and managed to get some video of it.  It's not great video as I had to remove a lens from the camera I was using to shoot the fireworks and struggled with the focus as it had been set to manual for the fireworks setup.  Some of the video is crisp enough to at least see the object clearly for a few moments at a time.  I'm fairly certain this was probably something terrestrial but it didn't resemble fireworks, aircraft, or balloons i'm familiar with so I figured i'd submit this and see if anyone else saw it as well.  The observers ranged in age from 13 to late 40's.  Blue collar to white collar workers.  Most reside in Indiana.  Several are from the Chicago area.;41.5681;-87.1749
