25 small red/orange spheres slowly moving in all different directions and fading in and out.;2011-08-26 20:30:00;30 minutes;25 small red/orange spheres slowly moving in all different directions and fading in and out.  They kind of faded back and forth from red to orange to white.  No particular shape or pattern that I could tell.   They were stretched in a line across the sky and looked identical to some of the video footage I have seen on Youtube in the past year or so.    Here, this is exactly the same thing we saw over Portage, Indiana     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_vwPG_ztn8.;41.5681;-87.1749
V shaped object appeared out of nowhere.;2016-11-09 17:12:00;30;My dad had called me, he said to look to the southwest of me.  He was sitting outside on his patio and this V shaped object appeared out of nowhere.  I began watching.  I took video and pictures.  It was easier to distinguish the shape with the naked eye as my equipment is not the best.  I continued to watch the object for around 25 minutes.  I came inside to swap batteries and when I returned, the object was gone.  I forgot to mention, there was not a star in the sky;41.5681;-87.1749
