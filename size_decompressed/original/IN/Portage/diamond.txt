Coming out of the south we viewed a few diamond shaped red edge illuminated objects.  Looked also like there was a yellowish fire glow inside the red illumination.  The objects appeared to be moving quickly toward the North over lake Michigan.   During the course of approximately 15-20 minutes this occurrence happened about 20 or more times.  There was no sound.  Just quick moving illuminated objects.  There were no more than two - three in fiew at the same time.;41.5681;-87.1749
Cluster of reddish-orange diamond shaped lights in a diamond formation twinkle before completely disappearing in North West Indiana;2013-06-26 20:00:00;5 minutes;Cluster of reddish-orange diamond shaped lights in a diamond formation twinkle before completely disappearing in North West Indiana I was in my bedroom, which is on the second floor, talking on the phone.  I looked out my bedroom window because I noticed something interesting in the sky. In the distance, there was a cluster of reddish-orange glowing objects that seemed to be flying in a diamond shaped formation.   The objects were not exactly round in shape because the light they each emitted formed a halo around each of them making each one appear more diamond shaped than spherical.   They were also arranged in a diamond formation.   When I got up and walked closer to my window for a better look, the lights began to flash in a twinkling or sparkling manner before disappearing one by one.  I do not believe the objects were air planes because air planes usually disappear out of sight gradually.  However, these objects &quottwinkled&quot before disappearing completely into thin air.
