Red orbs seen over Portage, Indiana.;2014-07-04 21:00:00;1 hour;Red orbs seen over Portage, Indiana. I was watching the Fireworks display at the Willow creek Middle School in Portage, Indiana, when a red orb came from the East and floated over the fireworks and then quickly disappeared.  I then noticed another coming from the East and finally told someone near me.  While I was watching the Eastern sky for more red orbs that person told me about another coming from the Northwest.  After noticing this orb for about one minute until it phased out I looked to the South and noticed three more coming from the Southwest. I watched these for a minute when I noticed a fourth emerging from a building all of which were in a straight formation line one behind another.  I watched these four for about three minutes until they too phased out when nearing the area of the School. I watched the fireworks for about three minutes when I noticed four more coming from the East each one of them trailing the other by about one minute but still visible when looking over the building from our vantage point.  At this point the Fireworks display was over and we were preparing to leave when I noticed two more coming from the East.  This time there was one above the other. On the way home we were traveling on 94 just before reaching the WalMart in Michigan City we noticed another red orb traveling Northwest at 10:08 p.m. Each of the red orbs mentioned were just above treetop level and in most cases the viewing time was three or more minutes.  If there was sound from the orbs it was drowned out by the fireworks.;41.5681;-87.1749
