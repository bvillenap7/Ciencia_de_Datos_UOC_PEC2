While driving home from work I noticed a cigar shaped craft in the sky just near Farmland Indiana going towards Parker City.  It was low, maybe only a couple hundred feet from the mature pine trees.  I slowed down my vehicle, and the craft seemed to slow down to, as if I noticed it, but it could've just been the fact that I stopped moving and made the craft appear to be slowing down too. But I sped home, and as soon as I would've come parallel to the craft it was gone. Other things I had noticed while driving where the orange lights near the rear.  The day was cloudy so it was very visible against the gray sky.  No other strange behavior aside from just coasting beneath the clouds.  Very strange!;40.1982;-85.1235
