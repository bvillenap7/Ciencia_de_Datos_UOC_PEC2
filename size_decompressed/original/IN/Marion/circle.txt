Bright white light, circle shaped and not moving.;2014-06-13 23:50:00;~4 minutes;Bright white light, circle shaped and not moving. Driving North we noticed a huge bright circle hovering in the air, not moving at all.   We stared and watched it as we drove towards it (approximately 4 minutes).  We turned and continued to watch it for about 10 seconds, and then it suddenly looked as if it flipped and thinned out into a white line and then  it was gone.  We could not see it anywhere.  It was as if it disappeared in mid air.  It was the brightest thing I've ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
