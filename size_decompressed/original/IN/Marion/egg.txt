We were sitting out side our house, when we witnessed an orange egg shaped glowing object.   We got up and it was hovering over an empty field.   We took a video but it was not bright enough to see in the taping.  It hovered for Bout 2 minutes.  The it made a ray of light into the clouds.   Then the egg shaped object moved and made a circle and went back to the same spot where we first seen it.  Then we lost sight of the egg shaped object.
