Space ship in a dream.;1979-06-01 23:00:00;1hour;Space ship in a dream. I was between 10 & 13 years old, when I had this dream about a Triangle space ship. It started at this grave yard I have never been too or seen before. I found myself sneaking through the grave yard not knowing why but just kept going. Then I seen a few other people doing the same as me just going forwared not knowing why. Then I noticed we were all heading towareds a pond, up by the waters edge is where we all went. It was weird I remember we were not speaking to each other, but I was not scared. Then all the sudden a man in white was standing above the water and started talking to us, he said he brought us all here to tell us we were using nuke power the wrong way. He said we would change that some day, and we all got a book. then he called me up there with him I stood beside him and then this bright lite came up out of the water beside him. It was like a big triangle. Then it was over.;40.5408938496582;-85.6597451025047

Triangle shaped ufo over I-69 Marion exit;2016-01-14 22:00:00;1 minutes;Triangle shaped ufo over I-69 Marion exit. I saw one earlier in the week prior, going along state road 18 east headed west  towards Marion near the I-69 exit. At first I thought it was one of those red blinking towers. As I approached closer I realized it was not and it was moving very slowly just maybe 100 ft over the trees. There's were 3 lights that I could see: green, red (one on each side), and at the point of the triangular object was a white light, almost like a search light. It made no sound to my knowledge. I told my brother to look at it and he said it was probably just a helicopter. I've never seen a helicopter move that slow.  As I passed it and looked back in my rear view mirror it looked as though it had 3 bright engines on the back.   Two nights ago I witnessed it again over I-69 but this time it was lower and moving south along the interstate. I tried shaking off the first time, but now it's been twice within a week or so. I have no idea how no one else saw this. I've never been so paranoid and am scared to see it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
