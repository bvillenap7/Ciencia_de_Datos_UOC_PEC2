On September 1, 2005, I was outide facing toward the North when a ball of light came from the South.  It was traveling at a high speed across the sky.  Once it passed my house heading North.  About five seconds after it came over the house, it flickered and then disappeared into the darkness.;40.5408938496582;-85.6597451025047
Multiple Orange Lights;2006-03-30 21:15:00;1 hour;Multiple Orange Lights We were driving home on a back country road last night around 9:15pm, I looked up at the sky through the front windshield and saw two orange colored lights that were close together, and one other light that was about a ½ a mile way from the other two. We were going about 35mph at the time. I pointed them out to my husband and he saw them also. We passed a clump of trees and we looked for the lights but they had disappeared. We got to our apartment complex about 10 minutes later, which was about a mile away from the sighting we parked our vehicle and stood outside talking. My husband and I both glanced up at the same time towards the southwest end of our complex and saw three brightly colored orange lights very close together about 20 feet apart from each other. They blinked on one at a time and stayed lit for about 10 seconds and then completely blinked off. Then we saw further to the right of where those lights where three more lights come on one at a time stay lit for 10 seconds and then turn off. They were separated about ½ mile from each other and were about 100 feet from the ground. There was absolutely no sound. We decided we were going to see where they were heading to so we got into the van and chased these lights. We headed south down the back country roads chasing them. One lit up to the left of our vehicle, only three lights this time and in the same sequence as before. It stayed three quarters of a mile ahead at this point. We continued to follow and saw it light up again this time on the right side of the vehicle and it seemed to be going about  45mph. It stayed just barely in front of us as we followed it. Once again only one and the same sequence of action. The last time we saw it light up there were the set of three lights, but there were additional lights this time, about two more and they were a bit  ahead of the three we were use to seeing. To us it seemed as if there was more then one. If asked I can not exactly say, they were in to many different positions they all stayed about 100 feet off the ground. We came to a dead end and could not follow them anymore so we turned around and went back home. The whole chase lasted about an hour and we ended up about 10 miles from our apartment complex. Tonight we decided we would check to see if we could see these lights again. I had seen on websites that others had also seen these lights in/around the same area. So we went near the area we first saw the lights and parked by a field. This was around again 9:15pm, we waited for about 25 minutes and saw nothing but just when we were getting ready to leave, My Husband, Step-Son, and I, saw these lights come on just south of our location. There were 12 to 13 lights on and the same orange color as before. Behind these lights we saw what looked like sparks shooting from behind it. We watched as it looked to be coming in from an angle and it started to turn more lights on. I’m not sure how far it was from the ground but it seemed pretty close. I tried getting a photo of it but it disappeared completely from there and never reappeared.;40.5408938496582;-85.6597451025047
Saw 2 different types of lights in the sky in Marion, IN.;2015-11-02 19:18:00;2-3 seconds;Saw 2 different types of lights in the sky in Marion, IN My boyfriend and I were walking to his parents about a block away.  The first lights we saw were on the way there.  We live outside of the city so we get an amazing sky view.  First we saw 1 white light that didn't flash at all like the airplanes and looked about twice the size.  There was no sound and it changed direction and speed about 3 times before disappearing suddenly.  We saw a second one far to the right behaving in the same way but going different directions.  When it went to the far right we could hear dogs begin to bark from the same direction. We get to his parents and we're there for awhile visiting and eating.  We leave and just as we head down the road, he says, I hope we get to see something else, an a bright orange shooting star shoots through the sky and appears to explode and disappear as it falls.  Did anyone else see this?  Please report it so we know we're not the only ones.;40.5408938496582;-85.6597451025047
