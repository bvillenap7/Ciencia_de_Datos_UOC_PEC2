Starlike light, orange lights.;2013-02-24 18:00:00;5-15 minutes;Starlike light, orange lights The following events take place between 18:00-19:50 on February 24th, 2013. I was facing the Northern Skies, the moon was full and the sky was clear. My friend and I were trying to kill time before visiting our mutual friend. We were in the same part of town as her apartment in Marion, IN. We were at a local Dollar General and a Casey’s General Store between sightings. Sighting One: Dollar General, MARION, INDIANA (State Road 15, also known as “the bypass”) I saw a bright star-like object near the moon moving downward and then it had disappeared. There are many things it could have been such as a satellite or a small space rock falling towards Earth, this I regarded as something ordinary. Sighting Two: Casey’s General Store   I was sitting in my friend’s Jeep while he bought gasoline.  I was downloading Sky Maps from Google Play on my phone because I wanted to identify a bright space object.  The object I was trying to identify was star-like in appearance, yet not uncommon.  It was most likely a planet or satellite, but still close to Jupiter. A few seconds later, I saw something otherworldly out of the corner of my eye and I stuck my head out of the window of my friend’s Jeep.  When I observed it fully, I was facing it, Northern Skies, the same part of the sky the moon was in and a bit far away from Jupiter.  I saw two orange lights on what seemed like a cigar or disc shape, the object slowly floated to the left of my field of view and had vanished, like it had faded into the sky while still moving slowly in the same direction.
