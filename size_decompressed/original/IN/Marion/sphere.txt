Now there were 2lights about 30 degrees off the horizon. I told my wife who was in the car with me to look at what I was seeing. We were meeting a car so she admonished me for not watching the road. I turned to face the oncoming car to make sure I was in control of the car. I again turned my head to look at the lights. This time I saw 4 lights in a row parallel to the horizon. Again I checked for traffic saftey by looking ahead. I again turned to face the lights. This time there were 2. While I was watching them they individually vanished one at time, just like as if someone turned of a light switch. The lights were perfect spheres sharply outlined with the light coming through a surface much like a frosted light bulb. The color was a pale orange glow. Their size was similar to a round automobile headlight when viewed from 20-30 feet away. My wife felt they were considerably bigger. We turned down the first road to the west to investigate the general area and drove 2 miles. There was no sound associated with this experience and no further sighting took place. I am a pilot and I have never experienced anything like this before or since. The weather was perfectly clear. They were not landing lights or navigation lights on an aircraft. Their glow did not change except to vanish instantly.;40.5408938496582;-85.6597451025047

Another group of 4 to the west other lights was not in formation some more was in a triangle shape.  Some seemed to almost hover momentarily while others continued on a few more single lights came after.  I lost count around 21.  All or most was viewed by my neighbors and my mom who was in another location.  No sound was heard.  I estimate altitude of between 10000 and 15000 feet.  Possible less.  Sky was clear.  The were a few prop driven aircraft in the vicinity and some higher altitude jet traffic;40.5408938496582;-85.6597451025047
