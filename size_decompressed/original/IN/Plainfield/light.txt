Two bright lights in the sky.;2008-12-02 19:00:00;5 minutes;Two bright lights in the sky. I can't be certain of the exact time.  My camera says 4:10 pm but I know that is not accurate.  My best guess is that it was around 7pm but could have been later.  I walked out onto the front porch to plug in the Christmas lights and looked up at the moon when I noticed to very bright white lights to the left of the moon.  They were brighter than the stars around them and looked like lights on airplanes as they approach the airport (which is near our house) or even like low flying helicopters.  The only difference is that they did not budge at all and they were not accompanied by the red and blue flashing lights that are visible on aircraft (especially on aircraft that are flying directly at you - which these would have had to have been because of the visibility of thier headlights - let me stress again that they did not seem to be moving at all). I called my seventeen year old daughter out to look at them and then called out my husband who stated that they were probably planets.  The only problem with his theory is that they seemed to be very similar in brightness and size which doesn't bode well for the planet theory.  And frankly, they were just too bright.  I've veiwed planets before while taking astronomy in college. My husband went back inside to watch tv and my daughter and I snapped a couple of pictures with my camera but gave up after feeling like we couldn't get a successful shot.  We went inside, reluctantly accepting my husband's planet theory.  When I went back out several hours later to unplug the Christmas lights the planets were not visible anywhere in the night sky. Today I was watching a UFO show on television and decided to go ahead and report my sighting.  The only think I know is that I can't identify what I saw.
