Orange slightly red balls motionless in the distant horizone.;2004-02-11 19:30:00;appx. 15 min.;Orange slightly red balls motionless in the distant horizone. Upon arriving home I entered my driveway facing NW and parked. I noticed over to my right @ apprx. a 45 degree angle and upwards to the sky @ apprx. a 30 degree angle a moderatly orange with a slight hint of red ball with a very weak whithish haze. At first sight there was only one, then with a few seconds there was a second one that floated as though it was exactly behind the first one or came out from within, and then a third doing exactly the same but came from the second one, #2 & #3 moved towards the left, or NW. They appeared to be at lest 50 miles off in the sky. The sky was mostly crisp and clear with a few very dark heavy clouds, but not close to the area of the objects. There also were a few planes in the sky being very easy to determine as such because of there markers flashing and steady pace of speed & direction. Then after all three sat motionless for appx. 1 min. the #3 object moved @ a very fast but graceful speed over towards due north apprx. 30 yards in the distant horizone. At that point they all sat still for apprx. only 15 sec. then disappeared instantly without any trace. At that point as I sat amazed for apprx. 2 min. and still looking in the same area one appeared again in almost the exact location as the first one but slightly left, the repeated the sequence minus the third object appearing and/or great movement. At last sight I was still gazing but had exited my vechile and walked toward the direction about 20 feet and stood looking for apprx. 5-6 min. and the once again one appeared but closer at an appeance of apprx. 25 miles off in the sky but more right and higher. It appeared for only about 30 sec. motionless then once again totaly vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness to alleged event elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));40.0174;-87.2569
