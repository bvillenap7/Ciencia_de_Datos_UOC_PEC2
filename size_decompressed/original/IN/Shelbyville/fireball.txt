Orange object appeared to be on fire seen by 4 in Shelbyville, Indiana;2012-07-29 21:38:00;2 minutes;Orange object appeared to be on fire seen by 4 in Shelbyville, Indiana I was walking with my wife and another couple at 9:38 p.m. on July 29, 2012 in Shelbyville, Indiana.  We noticed an irregular shaped object passing overhead that appeared to be on fire.  The color was orange and it did not make a sound.  It was difficult to tell how high the object was above us but it appeared to be fairly low.   We watched for about 2 minutes.   The object appeared to climb higher and eventually was out of our sight.   The speed seemed to be constant and the light from the object did not blink or change color from the orange that we first saw.   This was a very exciting experience for all of us.;39.5084;-85.79

It appeared to be fairly low in the sky and did not make any sounds.  It looked just like a fire that was flying in the sky with the outline of jagged flames.   We had seen the International Space Station a few nights ago, but this object was very different in appearance. The fiery object moved quickly and soon, it seemed to disappear.   Iâ€™m not sure if it did disappear or just moved out of sight.;39.5084;-85.79
