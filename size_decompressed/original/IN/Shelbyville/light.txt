2 bright lights, starlike, moving across the sky, one following the other.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD));2007-06-20 23:00:00;1-2 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD)) 2 bright lights, starlike, moving across the sky, one following the other, not close, both lights fade to pinkish hue then dissapear. This sighting was over Shelbyville, Indiana, approx 11:00, the night of Wednesday, June 20, 2007. 2 objects sighted, objects did not show any flashing traffic lights, just a solid bright white light, looked more like a star than an airplane. One object leading, one following, on what looked to be the same course. The second object was not close to the first. Objects were very high in the sky. Objects came from the northwest traveling south east. Objects were observed for approx 1-2 minutes as they crossed the sky. About 3/4 of the way across the sky, the first objects bright white light began to dim to a faint pinkish/redish hue, then to nothing, no lights at all. Hard to tell exactly, but it did look like that when the second object got to the same place in the sky where the first object had started to dim, the second objects bright white light started to dim also, going to a faint pinkish/redish hue, then to no lights at all. The area of the sky where the lights blinked off was constantly observed for approx 10-15 minutes after the lights went off, and no lights/activity was noticed. Not being an expert, but knowing what the commercial jets look like at night that fly in this area, all have some form of blinking traffic lights. I cannot see these as being commercial planes. Probably military???, but why would they turn off their lights completely?  I just thought this abnormal behavior for 2 airplanes flying together at night, and may be this might be of interest.

I very see jets and helicopters on a regular basis, due to Indianapolis International Airport & the National Guard Armory in Shelby Co.;2010-07-27 00:00:00;30 min.;I very see jets and helicopters on a regular basis, due to Indianapolis International Airport & the National Guard Armory in Shelby Co. When I was driving home from work (Indianapolis, IN.), I saw a couple of lights that didn't seem too peculiar.  One light (the brighter one) originally caught my attention because if was bright like a helicopter spotlight then it turned around the dimmer light and it didn't seem to have blinking lights like on the wingtips or belly of conventional aircraft, the other light seemed to twinkle red and green (or blue) lights with a solid white light.   I got home trying not to lose them but I lost the first helicopter and brighter light but still saw the smaller light just barely over the tree line in my backyard facing almost due west towards or even past Indianapolis.  I got a pair of small pair of binoculars out of my car and to try to get a better view of whatever I was seeing, when I went inside to get a larger pair of binoculars with a little better range.   I could not make out any discernible shape but it looked as if the blue or green light was on the right bottom and the red flashing light was on the left edge of the object.   I thought that if it was an airliner or something it should have moved much quicker and not look to me sitting almost motionless.;39.5084;-85.79
Bright light near Orion's shoulder.;2013-03-23 00:00:00;Not sure;Bright light near Orions shoulder. About a week or so ago, I was walking home from the gas station.  I'm not sure what time it was.  The sky was clear and I glanced up at the stars. I then noticed a star brighter than any other star near Orion.  It was a bright light, it looked like a very bright star, to the right and above the right shoulder of Orion (So his left shoulder if he's looking at us).  Orion was in the southwest part of the sky, almost upright, slightly leaning to the right.  The bright light stayed lit up for about 10 seconds before it just disapeared.  I stared in that spot for about 10 minutes but it didn't return.  It was very cold that night so I didn't bother staying outside and continue to watch.  I know what I saw but I have no idea what it was. I have been searching online for answers and stumbled across this site.  The only story I have heard that comes close to what I saw is a story someone posted from Hawaii.  The only exception is his was a flash that would return every 10 seconds.  I saw a light that didn't move (unless it was moving extremely slowly) it stayed lit for about 10 seconds, and then vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Multiple fast moving groups of lights.;2015-12-24 02:00:00;5 minutes;Multiple fast moving groups of lights. I was carrying in some groceries when I just happened to look up at the moon.  I saw what looked like at least 50 small lights that looked like stars but about the size you would see on a plane.  They were all in a formation, flying low and made absolutely no sound.   I tried to snag a few pictures but couldn't because the moon was so bright.  They stayed a constant shape, seemed to be all traveling in the same direction which appeared to be northbound.  Another observation was that they looked to be traveling in groups of 2 and 3.  I witnessed all of this for at least 3-5 minutes before heavy clouds covered the sky and moon.   This was also witnessed with a veteran of the U.S Navy.;39.5084;-85.79
