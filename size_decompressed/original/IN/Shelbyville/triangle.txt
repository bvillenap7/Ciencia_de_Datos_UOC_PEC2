Triangular blinking lights in the sky.;2016-09-21 04:23:00;Til Daylight;Triangular blinking lights in the sky I have seen these objects triangular in shape on an almost regular basis now since 9/21/2016.  They have colored blinking lights with yellow,amber and blue.  They hover and weave back and forth for short periods of time. There are not planes or satellites.  I just wonder if anyone else in my area has seen them?  They stay in the sky for quite a long time.;39.5084;-85.79
