At least 20 red lights moving across the sky.;2014-04-12 22:23:00;15 minutes;At least 20 red lights moving across the sky My wife, mother, father, and I saw at least 20 red lights moving from west to east.   We watched them for about 15 min or so then they were out of sight.   We have a video on our phone that shows them as good as a phone video can take. It was very Erie.   They did not make a sound so they were helicopters (they didn't make a noise) and they weren't planes and weren't flares or those Chinese lights that you send up in the sky.   They were red lights it was freakin crazy. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above, to reflect an evening sighting.  Also, the correct date is Saturday, April 12, 2014.  We have changed the date, as well.  PD));41.2376;-85.1684
