Several reddish-amber lights in the Indiana night sky still unexplained.;2012-04-13 22:00:00;8-10 minutes;Several reddish-amber lights in the Indiana night sky still unexplained.    My wife and I were coming home from a movie.  Being a police detective, I am able to drive my car in the county.  As I was parking and shutting my car off at my home, I saw through the windshield a peppering of reddish-amber lights along the eastern horizon.  They were going from the south to the north and rose above the clouds, out of sight.  There was no discernible pattern to their flight. This lasted about 8 to 10 minutes. I attempted to take a picture but the photo shows very faint specks of light. I had worked nights for over 15 years. In that time, I have seen all kinds of lights in the sky all of which were explainable. These lights were nothing I have seen in my life.  I welcome an explanation but so far I have found none.;41.2376;-85.1684
