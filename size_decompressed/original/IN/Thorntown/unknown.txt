It startled me when I saw it because is was  coming quick.  All I saw was a light.  Four points of light actually.  They shone out, like on the four corners of a square, and the square was lit up too.  Then the light veered to the left.  I was scared so I drove off, and I tried to keep an eye on the light, but when it went over my van, I couldn't see it anymore.  I didn't want to see it.  It was high.  Not low enough to see or hear anything.  I'm very afraid of alien abduction.  I don't know if I saw and actual ufo, but it scared me nontheless.  There were airplanes I saw later, but why wouldn't I have heard that if that is what I acutally saw?;40.1133;-86.5898
