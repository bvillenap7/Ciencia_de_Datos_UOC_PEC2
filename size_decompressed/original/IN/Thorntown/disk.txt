Whty I saw I cannot explain.;2013-07-25 20:40:00;10 seconds;What I saw I cannot explain. I saw a silvery disc shape from at least 6 miles away.  The evening sun seemed to reflect off of it.  It had to be at least an eighth of a mile long from this distance.  I saw it for 10 seconds, then it vanished.  Very odd.
