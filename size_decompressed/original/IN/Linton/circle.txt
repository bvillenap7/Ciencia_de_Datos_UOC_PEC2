Craft watches meteor shower in the nothern skies;2009-10-03 01:00:00;1 hour;Craft watches meteor shower in the nothern skies I walked out on my porch that evening/morning to take a leak as I live i rural area and was facing north. As I looked up I saw what I thought was the light of a airplane moving across the night sky. I noticed it because it was a very clear night, I did not see a single cloud in the sky, The light was moving toward me and looked like a star, I could tell it was very far away, I watched it for about 45 seconds and during that time it moved from north to south and I saw it zig-zag a few times during it' s trip, Then it stopped and I thought, There is a UFO or a satalite or something so I watched it for a few minutes maybe 15 or 20 and during that time I saw 3 shooting stars. I have no doubt it was a craft of some kind positioning it's self to watch the meteors. Man or other it was a UFO to me. If anyone else sen it report it.
