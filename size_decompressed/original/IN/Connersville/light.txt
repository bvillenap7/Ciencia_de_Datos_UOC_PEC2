Two lights moving at hig speeds no sound from north to south at night.;2008-08-25 22:50:00;6 Seconds;Two lights moving at hig speeds no sound from north to south at night. I have 5 power magnification on my night vision and while scanning the north sky I saw two objects moving at high speeds from north to south.  While tracking them one stayed in a straight line while the other zig zagged around it.  I continued to track till both were obscured by the city lights to the south of me.  Being a military trained observer I can say that both were moving at mach or slightly faster. There was NO SOUND.;39.6421;-85.1439
Bright, slow moving object with no sound moving graciously across sky.;2012-04-11 22:07:00;5 min;Bright, slow moving object with no sound moving graciously across sky. Bright light coming from the west, moving at a slow speed.  There were no colored, or blinking lights as there are on airplanes.  No sound as it traveled overhead and passing.  Continued direction was North East.;39.6421;-85.1439
I do not have anyway to capture video or good quality pictures.;2013-02-14 23:00:00;20 seconds;i do not have anyway to capture video or good quality pictures. I went outside to take my dog to the restroom and I saw a pinkish orb of light in the woods across the street after looking at it for a few seconds it shot into the air and dissapeared.  A few days earlier my mom and older brother saw a orb of yellowish light  and when my older brother touched the door knob it collapsed on itself and vanished. I do not know what is going on... sometimes we hear noises in the woods we can't explain. It sounds like a persons scream but its like a animals growl.  We've been by the woods and shined lights in them and saw somethings eyes that reflected red but we couldn't see the creature. It a closer every time we looked back.  When we shone lights at it it turned its head slowly to where we couldn't see its eyes anymore.  I believe these events are all related and would appreciate some explanation to what it could be.  I would like it if u sent somebody to investigate this area but do not contact me because my family doesn't know I''m filling out this report.  I assure you this is NOT a hoax.;39.6421;-85.1439
