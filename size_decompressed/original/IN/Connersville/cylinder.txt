Dec. 7, 2012 I reported to work close to 11:00pm.  Minutes later I was looking at camera monitors and noticed movement in one, as I used the zoom control on the panel to bring the image closer, I was shocked!                                                  Then when I realized what I was looking at, I was in awe and scared! Considering I was within 500ft of whatever it was.  The object, cylinder shaped,10-15ft in length and 4-5ft wide was hovering about 100ft from the ground. Hazy gray in color yet it was transparent, it would move slow as a floating feather to lightning fast speed, when turning/change direction, it seems to pivot, at one point while recording it shot straight up at a very high speed.
