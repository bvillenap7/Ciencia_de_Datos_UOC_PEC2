I was trraveling home and witnessed what seemed to be a bright star that was not suppose to be there . After Getting closer I noticed the main light was going red , blue ,then green . I got about 2 more miles closer and noticed 2 orange lights forming the base of the triangle . As I pulled up along side it it started moving towards the town of New Salem . I was doing about sixty it speed up and slowed down . It yawed a couple of times . I followed it for about another 5 miles then parked up at my friend s house . We then viewed it hover for about 1 hour .Right before I left me and him saw the cluster ufo . I am a computer tech , and have never seen one of these before . Then I went home . Called my boss who is located in rushville area . He saw it to just hovering . Then I went in my house and set for about another hour . After about 1 hour my C-Band Satelite started to blink in and out . I went out side to check it. I watched 2 more delta craft . They connected at the main ! light and then rotated in a clock wise motion . Then I saw the 3 edged star fly by the two delta wings . I went in to try and find the video camera when I went back out nothing was there .;39.6421;-85.1439
