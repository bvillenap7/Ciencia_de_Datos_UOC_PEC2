Round object seen in the forest Object hovered and quickly left.  Caught on film.;2007-07-09 21:00:00;2 minutes;Round object seen in the forest Object hovered and quickly left.  Caught on film. It was approximately 9:00 P.M. Monday, July 9th, 2007.  I was in the forest west of Seymour, Indiana.  I looked up and saw an unusual object stationary in the sky well above the tree line, yet below the clouds (it was a cloudy night-no stars were visible).  The object was round and metallic in form with three round lights on the underside.   I quickly grabbed the disposable camera I had with me and snapped a picture-which did turn out.  The episode was brief in nature-lasting only about a total of no more than two minutes.  The object hovered in one spot for a brief time and then quickly left-ascending into the clouds, leaving a green trail as it left.  It was unlike any other flying object I have ever known or witnessed.  There was some sound associated with this object, one which is difficult to describe.  It sounded like a low pitched hum, which intensified when it left.
