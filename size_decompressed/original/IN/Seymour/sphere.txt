On the way home going north on Burkhart Road in Seymour, IN, nearing Aisin factory I saw a glowing orange/red  object  drifting across the sky.  It made no noise.  This was myself and my husband. We turned onto our street of Darcis Drive and parked the car, and stood in the front yard and the neighbor came over to watch fireworks with us.  There were 2 objects in the sky slowly moving north.  Again they were quiet.   We stood there and watched and after a few minutes they were out of sight.;38.9582;-85.8874999999999
