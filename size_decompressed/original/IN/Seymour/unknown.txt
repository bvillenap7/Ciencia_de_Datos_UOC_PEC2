This is my first ever sighting.I was traveling north on Hwy 11 (ewing st.) at roughly 10:45pm.  As I passed the 9th st turn by the Citgo, i looked to my left and out of nowhere, what  resembled a shooting star was about half way across cemetery, and only 60 ft or so off the ground.  I was traveling just under the speed limit of 35mph, and it was easily doing 3 times that.  As it traveled past me, i saw something break away from the main and it too was seemingly on fire, but more of a quick flash.  The main was at about a 25 degree angle so i estimate that whatever it was probably landed near the next cemetery on up.  It was unlike anything im used to seeing in the air, and although i couldnt see what it was, it felt like it was bigger than a helicopter but smaller than an airline plane.;38.9582;-85.8874999999999
