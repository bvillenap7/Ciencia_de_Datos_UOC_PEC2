Three objects in sky above Seymour;2008-06-23 23:40:00;8-10mins;Three objects in sky above Seymour 	I was driving home from a buddies house heading south when I noticed a bright object in the sky. At first glance I wrote it off as a star or a planet, and then I noticed two more bright objects. I have always been into astronomy and this was unlike anything I had ever seen before. I was deeply excited so I raced home and ran outback and the object that was in the upper left had disappeared but the middle and the bottom right one was still there. At this point I ran in and got my Step Sister and her friend to confirm that this was not a star by just showing them what I was looking at and they too were struck with a since of confusion as to what it was. The one that was in the bottom right hand corner had moved up above the center one and started to move towards the north. While the center object appeared to stand almost still in the sky, moving only slightly but in such a way to suggest that it was not just moving due to the rotation of the earth. They appeared as bright objects and looked like they had a triangle shape to them similar to a stealth bomber. I know that there is a bombing range and an urban training center just about twenty or so miles in the direction that they where in which is east relative to Seymour. But I am certain that they were not because I have observed the flight habits of them at air shows and my stepsister grew up in an air force family and she was convinced that it was unlike anything she had ever seen. Short list of details... During the observation we saw many aircraft pass through the sky (aprox. 4-7). There was a blur around the objects. I went in to get my telescope and it is when I came out that the second one had started to move away. I was only able to get a quick glimpse of the middle object because it seemed to move every time I would get it in my sighting scope before I looked through the scope.;38.9582;-85.8874999999999
