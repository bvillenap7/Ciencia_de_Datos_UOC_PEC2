It looked as if a giant headlight were hanging in the night sky.  That's the best way I can describe it, because it wasn't a ball of light, but rather a focused beam of light pointing across the sky in one direction.  I'm sure you're familiar with the term no inertia...it hung in the sky for several seconds and then took off without any build-up to a speed of what a small airplane might run at if it were at full speed.  But like I said, when it took off it was instantly at that speed.  There was absolutely no sound coming from the object as it paced itself to a point in the distance about 1-2 miles away from us and then...WOOOSH!  it shot straight up through the clouds exactly like in the movies...the speed mirrored a bolt of lightning.  Anyway, that was it. The friends I had with me, although I haven't seen them in a few years, still won't talk about the incident.

A flock of 1000 lighted ducks soaring between Mars and Earth  blocking Mars for a split second.;2003-09-23 22:15:00;30 seconds;A flock of 1000 lighted ducks soaring between Mars and Earth  blocking Mars for a split second. I was leaving for work at 10:15 pm  and while walking out of my house I noticed how many stars were out and how bright they were.  I looked south to see how bright Mars was was and saw a bunch of tiny stars I thought.  Istood there thinking what constallation is that?  The longer I stood there I noticed it was moving!  It looked like a thousand stars in a concurve line, moving south.  It was between me and Mars because for a split second Mars was gone.  I went to work and asked people if they saw anything but no one did.  The best way to describe it would to be as if I was watching a thousand ducks in a flock with lights on them and instead of a v in a concurve line with an aura around them. What ever it was it was beautiful.;38.9582;-85.8874999999999
