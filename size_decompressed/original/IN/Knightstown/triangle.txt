Huge Triangle,state road 40, Indiana;1984-07-18 01:30:00;10 minutes;Huge Triangle,state road 40, Indiana Hello.This event occurred way back in July 1984 but left a lasting impression on me to this day and I feel it would be a worthy report,maybe some else in Indiana seen this same object at around the same time or anytime since then. I was driving home from my second shift job in Rush county and drove through Knightstown on state road 40.I was halfway between Knightstown and Dunreith,in Henry County,driving east.No other traffic was in the vicinity as far as I could tell/remember.It was a clear,warm starry night and as I looked off to the northeast,there was a huge black 'hole' in the sky in a triangular shape, probrably a quarter mile ahead of me.I thought I was seeing things so I sped up and rolled my window down to get a better look until I was almost partly underneath a third of it.It made absolutely no sound and as I slowed to about 5mph,I realized how huge this thing was.Paint a triangle in at least 2 football fields,side by side to get somewhat an idea.It seemed to be rotating very slowly but was stationary.I saw very faint colored lights on the tips.I could'nt make out any 'structure'or 'protrusions'on it.Just blackness. I did'nt feel threatened by it,but the size of it overwhelmed me and I drove off quickly for about another 1/4 mile and and again slowed down.As I looked back,it was still just sitting there,hovering.I was just very anxious(and scared) to get home in New Castle at this point to tell my folks what I had seen.I reported it the the H.C.sheriffs office,they took my name,phone# and was told they would check it out.I never heard back from them.I always rode home with a co-worker after that,I never witnessed it again. I've always wondered what would have happened if I had stopped and got out of my car.I sometimes think I missed out on a once in a lifetime chance of being part of something 'special'.In any case,I've never seen or experienced anything remotely like it since.
