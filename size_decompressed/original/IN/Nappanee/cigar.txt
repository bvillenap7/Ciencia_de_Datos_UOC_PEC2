The group was on a business retreat in the outskirts of Nappanee. It started raining, so we went back to our shelters. We all drifted to sleep. I was violently woken by my boyfriend who was slightly unnerved. We stumbled outside to see the cigar shaped objects flying above us. They generally floated counter clockwise right above us. My boyfriend hugged me tighter since I am the protective one in the relationship. One by one, the members of our group fell down as if they were instantly overcome with sleep. I was one of the last people to fall, even after I tried to run away. I woke up what seemed like a few minutes later. I was in a bright orange room where figures stood in the shadows. I pretended to be asleep. I soon was put into a deep sleep again. The next time I woke up, I was sleeping next to my boss in the cafeteria. We quickly roused the others before we verified our stories. A few of the people in the group had the entities change their clothing duri! ng the encounter. Others had strange marks on their forearms.;41.4499;-85.9892
