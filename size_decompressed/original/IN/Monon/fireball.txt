I was driving home from my robotics practice (I'm a coach) on a road facing North.  I then noticed a bright orange object that was at low attitude in the NW sky.  I stopped my vehicle to observe the object, because I have never seen anything like it before.  It was staying perfectly still with one slowly pulsating light underneath the craft.  The craft then suddenly moved right then left.  Then after the craft took off and all the lights disappeared so I couldn't track it no more.  There was other aircraft in the area that kept approaching the light.  I have seen this light before and noticed weird movements before, but  never thought of reporting it.  The air traffic around the light disappeared after the light disappeared.;40.8605;-86.8625
