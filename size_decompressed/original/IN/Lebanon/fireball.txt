They appeared and disappeared very quickly. While driving home heading North on SR39 there were 2 round orange fireballs in the North sky. The larger one appeared first followed by a smaller one to the right (or East) of the larger one. As quick as they appeared they disappeared. Then a few seconds later three more orange fireballs appeared and they were in a perfect straight line parallel to the ground and appeared lower in the horizon than the first two. A second later another smaller orange fireball appeared to the left (or West) of the three lined up in formation. Again, they disappeared very quickly. The objects appeared and disappeared in the same location. They never travelled at all in the sky. I have never seen anything quite like it.;40.0435000000001;-86.4593999999999
