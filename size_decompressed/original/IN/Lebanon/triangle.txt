V or triangle shaped object.;2010-11-17 07:15:00;2 seconds;V or triangle shaped object. I am not even sure what to put down, this happened so fast.  I was outside work smoking when I thought I saw something very strange.  It went by so fast I didnt even have a chance to get my phone camera out.  My first impression was that it was a large bird though there was no wing movement, then I thought it must be a hang glider or an ultralight though I have never seen them around here.  We had low cloud cover this morning and it was below the clouds.  I was looking at the clouds when it just appeared in front of me about 2 o'clock and moving to the south, pretty much following I65.  There was no noise or exhaust trail and it was moving extemely fast.  Within 3 or 4 seconds it was out of sight.  The item was brown and v shaped from what I could tell.  If I had to guesstimate a size, about 1 inch at arms length which seems so small but it was not a bird,, no bird I know of can move that fast.;40.0435000000001;-86.4593999999999
