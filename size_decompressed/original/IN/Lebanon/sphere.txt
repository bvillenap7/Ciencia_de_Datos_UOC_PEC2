4 huge reddish/orange balls of light on the 4th of July 2010;2010-07-04 23:00:00;10 minutes;4 huge reddish/orange balls of light on the 4th of July 2010 WE were all sitting out by the street with our lawn chairs watching the town's fireworks show at approx 10:00 PM..the fireworks lasted 20 minutes.  we all started lighting our fireworks and so did a few other neighbors down the street.  all of a sudden this woman yelled what is that you guys.  we all stopped and looked directly to our East.  there was a ball of reddish/orange whatever. moving from SW To NE.  silent and huge. place your index finger bottom at the edge of the ground and the top of your finger is the approx height up.  then all of a sudden another one and another one then another one.  the last one veered off to the NW and circled the town then proceeded in the same flight path as the others which was NE.  This was certainly something to see as whatever it was was most interested in what had been going on.;40.0435000000001;-86.4593999999999
