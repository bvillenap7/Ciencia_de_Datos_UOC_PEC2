Random lights at low altitude taking shape of triangle.;2007-01-28 20:03:00;30 seconds;Random lights at low altitude taking shape of triangle. I work a part time security position at a local grocery store.  Shortly after 8:00 pm, I stepped outside to have a cigarette.  At the time, it was a clear evening.  There had been clouds and snow earlier and later in the evening.  I was looking up at the stars when I noticed a formation of what appeared to be a flock of geese at first.  The formation was approximately 300 feet off the ground and was passing over a local business that had bright lights illuminating the business.   This formation appeared to be in the form of about 6 to 8 individual lights, however after looking more carefully at it, it seemed to be individual reflections coming from the lights of the business reflecting off the object(s).   As it moved in a southeasterly direction and away from the business lights, the individual reflections diminished in their intensity and the lights (reflections) took the shape of a triangle with two lights centered in the rear.  As it moved away, the light reflection diminished to the point I could no longer make out the object.  There was no noise associated with this object as you would have expected with a small aircraft. There were also no blinking lights of any kind which again would indicate an aircraft.;41.6923258278147;-85.9699854304636
