Silver Cigar-Shaped Object, Elkhart, IN,;1998-07-06 13:30:00;8 seconds;Silver Cigar-Shaped Object, Elkhart, IN, This craft(?) was viewed from an Amtrak train headed West to Chicago. It was in a nearly cloudless sky gliding over a group of trees in the distance. At first, I mistook it for a passenger jet, ready to crash. It had no rudder and was moving far too slowly for a conventional plane. As soon as I saw it had no markings or features, the front end lifted to a 45-degree angle. It then turned slowly away and faced away from me. While it made this maneuver, the sun shone brilliantly from its polished-chrome(?) surface. No wings or engines were visible and no sound could be heard above the train's noise. It then shot out of sight faster than anything I'd ever seen. This info appears online for the first time.;41.6923258278147;-85.9699854304636

I stood there examining the craft for several seconds.  Then realizing what I saw was a ufo, I tried to bring it to another buddy's attention, but by the time they looked, it was almost out of sight.;41.6923258278147;-85.9699854304636
