It is the third of july but at the time not many fireworks were going off, and me and my friend were going to my house and I saw red lights coming down, and at first I believed them to be fireworks.  Then they stopped in mid-air and changed direction heading towards us.  Eventually it passed overhead and I saw the craft indefinitely.   I saw everything from it spinning to the shape to the grooves and what appeared to be pikes on four sides.  It was extremely close and me and my friend stared in amazemrnt for about a minute and like a shooting star it disappeared straight up.;41.6923258278147;-85.9699854304636
Bright orange spinning sphere with smaller sphere circling it that sped off into the moon;2012-07-27 23:32:00;2 minutes;Bright orange spinning sphere with smaller sphere circling it that sped off into the moon After leaving the store my companion and I noticed a round bright orange object in the sky above us in a slightly south east position, it had a smaller round object orbiting it but they both were spinning.  We pulled into a fast-food restaurant to watch it and it zoomed away toward the moon and appeared to enter into it.  The object appeared very close at the time of the sighting.;41.6923258278147;-85.9699854304636
