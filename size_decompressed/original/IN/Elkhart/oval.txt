As I approached the County Road 13 overpass I saw a orange light in the sky. I pulled over and the object which was slighly north east of my position and  began to travel to the  south east.  It appeared as if the craft was moving on another axis  as it moved forward. Soon after its movement to the south south east it disappearred. The orange light was similar to a calcium street light, same coloration.  It appeard that there was either a haze or something every so often moving over the light that caused it to dim.;41.6923258278147;-85.9699854304636
