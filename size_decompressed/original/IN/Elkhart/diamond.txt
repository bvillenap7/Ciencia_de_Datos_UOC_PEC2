A red red sphere folllowing a blinking diamond shaped thing.;2009-01-03 21:00:00;5 Minutes;A red red sphere folllowing a blinking diamond shaped thing. I was closing my drapes at night, and I like to just look out at the sky. The drape I was closing was to the south. Off to my left- which is east, I seen a diamond shaped thing going across the sky. It had one very white bright light that stayed on and it blinked very white bright lights. Right close behind it in perfect unison was a red sphere following.  I watched for about 5-10 minutes as it went along the southern sky from east to west, until it disappeared in the distance and through the trees. There were also planes flying in the vicinity who just kept righ on flying. It was not a plane, for planes do not follow that close together and planes also have blinking lights besides one being stationary. I also submitted a report to MUFON. I do not remember the exact day. Though it has been since the beginning of this year. This has been the second time I have sighted a UFO.
