decending ball of bright yellowish light that suddenly disappeared just above the horizon on a clear night.  ((Meteor??));2007-03-04 19:33:00;5 seconds;decending ball of bright yellowish light that suddenly disappeared just above the horizon on a clear night On an extremely clear night with unlimited visability, we just saw a very bright yellowish round light falling from the Western sky.  It left no tail and seemed to emit a steady luminesence.  It descended straight down at a moderate speed and then disappeared just above the horizon.  No evidence of ground strike could be seen.  This could have been a meteor.;41.6923258278147;-85.9699854304636

I saw a line of lights going across the sky in single file heading in the same direction. ((Starlink satellites?));2019-12-22 19:20:00;10 min;I saw a line of lights going across the sky in single file heading in the same direction. once they got to a certain spot they would disappear and more would come from behind.  There was no sound and it was hard to tell how high they were but I would guess a few thousand feet off the ground.  There were no clouds in the sky so I don't know why the lights would disappear and they got to a certain point in the sky.  I'm just wondering if anyone else in the area seeing the same thing.;41.6923258278147;-85.9699854304636

It was brighter and larger than any star.  At first I thought it was a meteor but I kept watching in the area which it appeared.  We are between airports and see planes all day and all night.  It was a very clear night and we see so many stars at our location on our mini farm.  It flashed five times about thirty seconds to two minutes apart at different locations but in a tight pattern.  The light flashes like it’s spinning from left to right and moving very slowly.  There was an absence for about fifteen to twenty minutes. During the absence, two planes had crossed in the sky and a bright flash of light like an explosion had appeared with flaming debris falling from that spot but the planes kept moving in their own directions without pause.  My daughter arrives home with her boyfriend and I explained to them what I saw.  They started to watch the sky with me and saw that it had moved North West of us.  They were witness to the last two flashes in the other location.  This was all taking place in a forty-five minute span.;41.6923258278147;-85.9699854304636
