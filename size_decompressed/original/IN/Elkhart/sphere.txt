They were circling around eachother very close and at a high rate of speed. I looked up in the sky at around 4:00pm, and towards the west, I observed 6 or 7 spherical objects moving north in a tight cluster. They looked very small, though it was hard to tell because I'm not sure how far away they were. They were circling ordancing around eachother in a very tight formation, and at a very high rate of speed. It appeared to be some kind of figure 8 pattern they were making around eachother. Then, they just kind of disappeared, one at a time. It was a clear blue sky in broad daylight. That was the background. My girlfriend also witnessed the event. I called to her to come & look, because at first I thought it was a smudge on my sunglasses, or my contact lense. Then I realized that smudges don't move and pulsate like that. We tried to think of anything we could that would identify what we saw, but, we knew it was something that could not be identified. Anything man has made would've crashed doing what they were doing. I'm surprised they DIDN'T crash!;41.6923258278147;-85.9699854304636
Seven sphereshaped objects on fire Elkhart Indiana 3/19/2011;2011-03-19 21:30:00;20 minutes;Seven sphereshaped objects on fire Elkhart Indiana 3/19/2011 Last night I heard of your website on the Coast to Coast broadcast.  I was so happy to get information of where I could report an incident that occurred to my family a year ago to day, March 19, 2011. My family consist of my wife my self and our 7 year old son.  The date of the incident is easy to recall as it was our anniversary.  We had just returned home from my wife’s brother’s home who lives in Flint Michigan.  We live in Elkhart Indiana.  It was 9:30 p.m. and my wife and son were in the back yard walking our dogs as we had been gone the entire day visiting her brother.  They called out to me to come quickly there was something in the sky. When I approached them they were pointing to the east towards a little town called Bristol.  In the sky there was a sphere shaped object about 50 yards long and 30 feet wide completely engulfed in flames at a height I would estimate to be one half mile.  It was traveling very slowly and gaining altitude as it traveled.  We were then surprised of the appearance of a second object with the same exact description as the first.  As we watched the two crafts five more eventually appeared and all were spaced the same distance apart, about a half mile.  They were all traveling west and slowly climbed. This all occurred over a time period of about 20 minutes;41.6923258278147;-85.9699854304636
