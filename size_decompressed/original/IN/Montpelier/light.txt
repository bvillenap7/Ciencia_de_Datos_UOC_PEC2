Bright light moving around;2015-03-31 21:00:00;3 hours;Bright light moving around I was watching the sun set while watching tv, and shortly after the sun has set I noticed a very bright light in the western sky.  I just figured it was some star so I didn't pay much attention.   After a while I noticed that it had moved.  It moved to a more northern direction, and it seems to have dropped in elevation.  I go get some binoculars to see if I can see it more clearly but it just never seems to get in focus.   I kept an eye on it for the better part of 2 hours and I noticed occasionally that it would move around.  Short spastic movements, so I started noticing that this was no star, and a plane couldn't hover in place like it did, and there were planes flying by that I used for reference.  I started to think it could be a weather balloon, but the light was just to bright for that distance, but the movement would make sense giving there were some coulds. But the light moved further west, but the winds around here head east.  This elimates it from being a ! weather balloon.  I'm kind of astonished and amazed but slightly scared.  I want to know what it was.;40.5617;-85.2513
