Unusual streak of green to blue light flew down the southern sky.;2008-04-16 04:20:00;about 1 second;Unusual streak of green to blue light flew down the southern sky. While driving home about 04:20 EDT, north of Jasper, IN by about 5 to 8 miles, I was facing south and saw a greenish to blue-ish streak of light in the southern sky, heading mainly south with a little to the west.  It was only 1 streak visible as most of my view was covered by a thin tree-line.  As far as identifying the object, it could be anything due to the thin line of trees in the way.  All I can confirm is the streak of light that appeared and disappear suddenly at approximately the given time.  This is the first time I have seen a streak of light like such that was like 1/4 of an inch thick from my view and distance.;38.36;-86.9286000000001
