Four bright lights seen over Jasper, IN;2008-07-10 00:35:00;15 minutes;Four bright lights seen over Jasper, IN I got up tp head to bed at 00:00 and went to kitchen for a drink, looked out the window which faces the West. I saw the Moon was in a very strange location and which seemed to be interacting with a cloud face. I alos noticed a bright light a large distance to the r ight of the moon which I thought might be a star. I stood there for a few sconds and out of nowhere another bright light appeared to the right of that light. I went to get my camera because I had seen this same event several months before but on a very clear night and at 03:30. When I got outside with my camera, there now was a total of four lights forming a V with the tip pointing up to the ski, and lacking one light to make a perfect shaped V. As I attempted to focus my camera on the sighting, the lights were gone. I served time in the USAF as a jet engine mechanic, grewup an airforce brat in the same branch. I have been around and interested in aircraft my whole life and I know of no aircraft that acts or reacts in the manner I have discribed.;38.36;-86.9286000000001
At least 15 orange discs that formed a V formation with a tail.;2015-11-02 21:45:00;10 seconds;at least 15 orange discs that formed a V formation with a tail. I was on my balcony smoking and was looking up for shooting stars and looked up over my house to the southwest and saw at least 15 flying discs that each had a bright orange light.  My jaw dropped and I saw that they were flying in a V formation with some coming backwards from the apex of the V and curved around to the right making what looked like a tail off the right side of the V formation.  They were gliding through the air effortlessly with no sound.  They headed southwest in the sky and traveled out of my line of sight.   It was truly amazing to witness and it was very beautiful and majestic.;38.36;-86.9286000000001
