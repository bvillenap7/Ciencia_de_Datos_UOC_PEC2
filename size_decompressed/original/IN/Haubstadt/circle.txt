It filled the sky over our yard. Glowed even brighter red then disappeared. No sound. Seemed to be alot of electricity in the air. It interrupted a cell phone conversation and caused me to lose signal which is very unusual. 2 pet dogs seemed to be very disturbed. I almost felt like I was being x-rayed.
