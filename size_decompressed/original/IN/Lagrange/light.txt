Strange lights over Lagrange Indiana 12/10/2020;2020-12-10 17:00:00;30 minutes;Strange lights over Lagrange Indiana 12/10/2020 I was talking to a friend in my driveway and witnessed strange lights low in sky. The light was very bright white and meandering around slowly. Too slow to be a plane and too bright to be a drone. After 15 minutes or so the light turned red and occasionally flashed the bright white light. Eventually it faded off heading west best I could tell.;41.6491;-85.4024
