Reddish Oval Observed;2003-11-27 22:25:00;15 SEC;Reddish Oval Observed Conditions: Clear dark sky, no clouds or moon, temp 2C with a light breeze. My wife and I often look at the night sky while in our hottub. We are familiar the  constellations, satellites and airplane routes. This oval reddish object was travelling SSW at least 2 to 3 times faster then any  transatlantic jet we often see overhead. The object then veered 45 deg. to the right then sharply turned left 90 deg. I was going to dismiss this as just a bird  flying but the object had a reddish glow and seemed luminescent as well as it was almost 10:30 pm. No sound was heard and this observation lasted for approx. 15 seconds. I enjoyed the expirience but it disturbed my wife. Did anyone else see this?;46.3978;-63.7824999999999
