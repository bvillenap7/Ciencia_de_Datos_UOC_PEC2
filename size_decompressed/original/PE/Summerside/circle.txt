White object flying in zigzag pattern over Summerside, PEI, Canada;2009-08-23 22:30:00;1 min;White object flying in zigzag pattern over Summerside, PEI, Canada We observed one white, circular object which we thought at first was a plane flying across the sky. It exited some clouds and then began to fly in an erratic manner. It was flying in a zigzag away from us, making 90 degree turns without slowing down. It made at least 5 90 degree turns and then turned around and headed back towards us. It slowed down, flew in what seemed to trace a semi circle across the sky back and forth several times and then continued to fly in a zigzag pattern away from us until it disappeared behind a building.  We were in a hot tub at the time, stargazing. It was partly cloudy. Neither of us were wearing glasses or contacts. We were not under the influence of alcohol and neither of us has a cold that would affect our vision or hearing. We are both graduate level students in science.;46.3978;-63.7824999999999
