Speeding Ball of Light;2004-03-19 20:30:00;10-15;Speeding Ball of Light I just finished witnessing something I have never seen before. I was outside having a cigarette when I noticed a satelite going by from South travelling north. Then I noticed a really bright light coming from the West heading East. It was travelling at a unbelievable rate of speed, I tracked it for about 10 to 15 seconds. Then it appeared to make a slight right turn and just disappeared.;46.3978;-63.7824999999999
