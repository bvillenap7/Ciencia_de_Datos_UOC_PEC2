We watched a bright light traveling ESE from WNW at a rapid speed. It was the brightest light in the sky.  There were no green or red flashing lights visible at any time. It took approximately 2 minutes to travel across the sky. We had 4 witnesses. It got smaller and smaller as we watched and finally disappeared. One witnesses is a mech/elec engineer with several patents. He estimated the object to be flying at approximately 25,000 feet.  Color temperature of the light was cold.  It was way under the speed of a shooting star, way over the speed of an aircraft. Lat 46.1667*N Long 62.6500*W;46.163;-62.6499
