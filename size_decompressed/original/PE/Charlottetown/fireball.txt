fireball over charlottetown;2004-02-02 19:30:00;seconds;fireball over charlottetown I was outside having a cigarette on our back patio, when I saw what looked like a fireball shoot across the sky horizontally.  The object was in the southern sky travelling in a eastern direction, and it was pretty low between 500 and a 1000 feet aprox.  The object also left a very long vapor trail behind it which hung in the air for aproximatly 20 minutes and had alot of sparks coming from behind it.  I'm pretty sure this wasn't a meteor cause it was so low and it made no noise at all.  I called my dad out right away and he saw the vapor trail left behind and he also couldn't believe it made no sound.  I sure someone else must have seen this object, and I'd like to know if they did.;46.2685879310345;-63.029247413793
