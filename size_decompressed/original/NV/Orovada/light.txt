Orange Circular Light in the Sky (Nevada);2018-03-05 07:45:00;2 minutes;Orange Circular Light in the Sky (Nevada) I was driving North West at about 7:45 pm on March 5th, 2018, when I saw a bright circular orange light appear in the pitch black sky.  It lit up and stayed lit for about 2 to 3 seconds and then slowly vanished.  It reappeared in the same location after about 3 seconds and stayed on for another 3 seconds before it disappeared for good. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello Mr Davenport, The orange light looked as big as a street light, but just a little brighter.  It was bigger than any of the stars or planets visible, but definitely smaller than the moon at any given phase. I’ve seen the orange lights in the sky in the same location before.  Last time (within the last 6 months), there were 6 of them in a neat row, not too far above the actual street lights.  They looked like they were above McDermitt, NV, and they were also stationary.  I didn’t file a report at that time.  I didn’t realize that I could! Thank You, ((END ADDENDUM));41.6654;-117.9083
