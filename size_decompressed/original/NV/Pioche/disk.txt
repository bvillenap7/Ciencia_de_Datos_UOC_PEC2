getting used to seeing strange hovering (things) in the sky here in Nevada;2006-02-14 00:00:00;1 hour;getting used to seeing strange hovering (things) in the sky here in Nevada There is a lot of activity here in nevada. a lot this last month. I think we must live by some testing area of area 51. Most of the time we see lights that hover that look like a star.They move around mostly when we are driving but tend to stop when we stop. There are usually two or more of these when we see the big ones. These small ones are quite high and seam to patrol around. The big ones we see light up to a kind of orange glow when ever they move.The look like a orange light slightly wider in the middle. i have seen 5 of these lit up at the same time. we have a farm out in the edge of nevada and are very isolated from alot of people. i am kind of getting used to seeing strange things in the sky. I say this, these are not airplanes because they Hover. I could get pictures if i had some way to zoom way up. Strange huh it;37.8981;-114.3968
