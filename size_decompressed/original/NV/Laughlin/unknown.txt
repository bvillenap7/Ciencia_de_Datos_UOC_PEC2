Swarm of orange lights over Laughlin, NV;2001-08-25 20:45:00;00:15;Swarm of orange lights over Laughlin, NV What looked like a loosely organized swarm of orange lights emerged from roughly the southwest around 8:45pm local time as seen from a boat on the Colorado River near Laughlin, NV on Saturday, 25 August 2001. The swarm of lights, each of apparently equal brightness and being similar in color and brightness to the star Arcturus, initially subtended a fairly small angle comparable to the apparent angular diameter of the moon. Over the course of approximately fifteen minutes, the swarm moved toward the northeast while simultaneously dispersing and becoming dimmer. By the time the lights were directly overhead they had dispersed enough for the swarm to subtend an angle comparable to at least ten times the apparent angular diameter of the moon, and each had become so dim as to be barely visible. The total number of lights is estimated at between thirty and fifty. At least five other people witness this event. The organization of the swarm of lights did not appear to be in any geometric pattern, however  they did remain roughly equally spaced even as they dispersed. At least one witness reported observing one or more lights moving in a slightly wavering path rather than a perfectly straight course.;35.134;-114.641
