Disco lights in the sky.;2017-08-21 05:00:00;1:30;Disco lights in the sky. I observed one circular bright white light in the sky.  To the right of it there was another circular object or triangular that flashed all kinds of different colors.  The Colors looked to be a mix of red, blue, and green lights.   The Bright white object stayed until daylight and the colored lighted object seemed to slowly pull out of viewing distance after observing it for about an hour and half.;39.2435;-114.8883
