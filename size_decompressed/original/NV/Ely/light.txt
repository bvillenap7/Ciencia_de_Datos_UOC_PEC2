Wife noticed 4-5 bright orange lights in a line moving south, so i pulled my phone out and started to record the lights. They seemed to break up or fall down at an angle and disappear, only to reappear several miles away down the valley. This continued until we could no longer make them out due to the distance.;39.2435;-114.8883
