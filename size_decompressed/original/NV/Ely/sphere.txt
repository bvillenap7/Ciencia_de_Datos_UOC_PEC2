2 bright red lights south of ely;2005-10-24 20:00:00;10 minutes;2 bright red lights south of ely Driving south of Ely, about six to seven miles out, my husband and I saw an extremely bright red ball in the southern sky.  We live here, and make this drive at night constantly.  It was much bigger than a star, and very very bright, reddish orange, and it was definately not a plane, there were no trails, and they didn't move.  Surprised, we looked at each other making sure it was real.  It didn't move at first, and it wasn't on the mountain, or a car. It was in the sky. It just stayed there for a bit, then it disappeared.  Moments later it reappeared in the same spot and stayed for awhile, and another, same size and shape, appeared a little below it. The second ball disappeared after a few seconds, and shortly after that the first ball disappeared.  It kept appearing and disappearing.   Finally it went away, and we never saw it again.   We have never seen anything like this before, and were actually a little shaken by it. ((NUFORC Note:  At first glance, we thought the report might be addressing a sighting of the planet, Mars.  However, there should not be two of those planets visible in the night sky, and they should not suddenly disappear.  PD));39.2435;-114.8883
