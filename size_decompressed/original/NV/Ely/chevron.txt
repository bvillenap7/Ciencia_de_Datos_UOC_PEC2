1 craft, slow moving, less then 70 mph, appx 300 feet off of ground;1999-02-24 19:00:00;5 minutes;1 craft, slow moving, less then 70 mph, appx 300 feet off of ground While traveling north on US 93 about twenty miles north of Ely, Nevada about 1900 HRS I saw two bright lights coming south following the roadway.  I pulled over and it was extremely dark.  The craft appeared to be either chevron or triangular shaped.  One vehicle passed me going south bound and from this i estimated the speed of the craft.  As I was parked there the craft turned away ( towards the east slightly )  I must note that the exact shape is not known.  It appeared to have a bright light at each wing tip, one in the middle, a red blinking one behind it, which was not noticeable until it passed by and about six square window  like lights on the bottom surface of the wings.  It made an jet like noise but at a much lower decible level and the noise did trail the actual craft.  Shortly after I noticed the two light pattern moving northward at a very high speed, turn towards the west, then south then east over me at a much higher altitude and continue east.  It might just be an airplane, posibly a shape simalar to the B-2, the the extrememly slow speed is the main reason I am reporting in hopes to some insight as to what it was.;39.2435;-114.8883
