Cylinder Shaped w/5 Amber Lights crosses Nevada skyline (E-W) in 20 seconds silently around 9pm.;1990-10-27 21:00:00;15 Seconds;Cylinder Shaped w/5 Amber Lights crosses Nevada skyline (E-W) in 20 seconds silently around 9pm. Around October 27, 1990, I and my sister-in-law were returning to Nevada from Northern Idaho along SR93 south of Twin Falls, Idaho.  She and I were approximately 30 miles north of Wells, Nevada when we saw the object.  It was approximately 9:00 p.m. and the sky was crystal clear partially lit by the moon.  There was plenty of snow on the ground so the desert lights up almost as if it were dawn.  It was a cylinder shaped object with 5 amber lights on the side which did not pulse.  They steadily emitted light. We both saw it and proceeded to watch it cross the sky from East to West in about 15 seconds.  The distance from which we first saw it in the east to when it disappeared in the western horizon had to be at least 75 miles.  It made absolutely no sound and for as close as it was I found that really odd. Ironically, I fully accepted what I was seeing and kept expecting the car to loose power which thankfully it did not.  We just looked at each other wide eye and grinned.  We both said we have no idea what we just saw.  We didnâ€™t say anything the rest of the way into Wells.  What an amazing experience.
