It is more the color of a LARGE YARD LIGHT, with a very  dark yellow or harvest moon cast to it subsequently lending a halo effect to the bottom part of the light. It is now higher in the sky than it was so that if I put my index finger in front of it, it is hidden.  But was much larger about a half an hour ago.  It seemed to hover above the Pequop mountain range to the east of us.  Most people would say that it was a satallite  But those things are supposed to be much higher in space and maintain an orbit.  This thing would wobble from side to side like someone on the joy stick was looking for something.  The night sky is very crisp and clear here tonight. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been observing a celestial body, perhaps Mars.  PD));41.1157;-114.9599
