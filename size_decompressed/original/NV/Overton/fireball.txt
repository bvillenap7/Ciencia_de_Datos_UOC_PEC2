I witnessed what appeared to be a falling star directly North of me that suddenly separated into three objects that looked as if the meteor broke up on entry.  the three objects then came back into one and the object stopped and just did nothing, then faded out.  About two minutes later I saw a dim object N. by N.W. of my location travelling back and forth horizontally.  Suddenly five fireballs were ejected downward and disappeared suddenly.  The object stopped for about a second, then travelled in a N.W. direction at about a 90 degree angle and emitted another 6 fireballs in rapid succession that also appeared to fall downward.  the object then disappeared from my view.  I then got on I-15 Southbound and at about 8:15 PM saw a bright light off to my right at mile marker 85 it was stationary and increased in brightness for maybe 2 seconds and then dissipated.  At approximately 8:25 PM. I saw four Fighter planes from Nellis AFB pursuing a rapid course in the direction in which the objects were spotted. The only other information that comes to mind is that when I initially thought I was Witnessing a meteor coming into our atmosphere, the object had a very yellow hue to it, as opposed to a more white hue associated with such objects.  The other witnesses were: a person who pulled off the road to witness the event, as well as, three truckers who were pulled over on I-15 looking up in the vicinity of the incident.;36.5703;-114.4752
