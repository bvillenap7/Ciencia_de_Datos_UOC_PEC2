trapazoid object with cluster of smaller lights following in the same direction;1986-03-29 19:30:00;10-12min;trapazoid object with cluster of smaller lights following in the same direction On U.S. 93 30 miles north of Alamo, Nevada. Me and my co-driver, we drive a truck together, were driving south, when we seen a rectangler craft moving southwest to northeast towards Salt Lake. We actually stop the 18-wheeler in the middle of U.S. 93 and got out to look at this thing. As this object is floating over us, with no sound or effort, I am looking at my partner's eyes to make sure he is seeing the same thing that I am. This craft is moving about 400-500 feet above our heads, in the dark we can see that it is a rectangle, but moving wide end first. The narrow end was towards the rear. Two red lights on the front edges, blue to green lights on the rears edges that blocked out star light in the background. We estimated to be about 300 feet across to 600 feet long. It didn't make a soung as it cruised by at about 20-40 miles per hour. It disapeared over the eastern mountains of Nevada, heading towards Salt Lake/salt flats. We stand there in the middle of the road in disbelief. Just as we are ready to leave 3 minutes later, I took one last look up to see about 30-50 lights that were the size of a satalite as it crosses the sky at night. But, these lights were not in a certain formation or any kind of order. It was like a bunch of ballons moving across the sky. In the same direction these lights moved much faster and were over the range within 1-2 minutes. Then when we finally started to leave, two military jets buzzed our rig just before we got into Alamo.
