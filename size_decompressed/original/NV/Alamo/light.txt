4 bright lights, then disappeared.;2018-09-25 21:22:00;10sec;4 bright lights, then disappeared I was driving Northbound on Highway 93 North of Las Vegas and south of Alamo, Nevada, at approximately 9:22pm, 9/25/18. To my right out the passenger side of my windshield I saw four bright yellowish-orange lights traveling in a single file, close together.  When all of a sudden they all collapsed into the southernmost light like a slinky and then disappeared. I was talking on my phone and didn't have time to record, as this all happened in less than 10 seconds from the moment I realized what I was seeing. This was my first experience like this, so I will be more prepared if there is a next time.;37.3259;-115.308
