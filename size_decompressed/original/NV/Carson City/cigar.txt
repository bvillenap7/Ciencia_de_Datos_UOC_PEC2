UFO Military Aircraft;2007-07-20 21:20:00;2 minutes;UFO Military Aircraft I heard a large helicopter approaching from the south and went outside in the back yard to have a look. From the southeast almost directly over my house tonight, about 9:20PM were two objects flying in tandem about 100' apart, they both had an almost white reflective-like hull with absolutely no lights, strobes, cockpit lights turned on anywhere, being followed closely by one military black hawk helicopter with one red strobe light on. The two objects were out in front, had no wings, no noticeable rotors spinning, cigar-like shaped structures. They couldn't have been helicopters as there was no multi-rotor swash in the air that you hear with multiple helicopters in flight. They kept a tight tandem formation. All three aircraft were flying in tandem at the same speed together about the normal speed as any commercial helicopter. As they passed by the house I quickly ran to the front of the house and watched as they turned and went westbound over Hwy 50 over the mountains, the two objects out in front of the black hawk becoming harder to see the further away they went. With just a hint of setting sun in the west I could still see the black hawk rotor blades but nothing for the other two objects in front. The elevation here is about 4500' and the aircraft were flying probably at around 7500' - 8000' not too low but not real high either. It is extremely unusual for any aircraft not to have it's lights on in the night sky at this time of night. Something very strange was getting a military escort tonight to somewhere. About 25 minutes later I heard and saw the same red strobed military helicopter return from the west heading south, but it was too far west to see if the other objects were still with it.;39.1913829875523;-119.753388520057
