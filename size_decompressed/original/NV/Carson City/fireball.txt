A slow moving fireball that stood still at times and eventually reduced in size ad faded away back in space.;2014-10-01 12:17:00;12:47;A slow moving fireball that stood still at times and eventually reduced in size ad faded away back in space. What appeared to be a persistent  particulate trail exhibited different characteristics: a needle shaped chemtrail with a thickness that thinned behind an elliptical to orbital light craft like a syringe.  The trail of this craft twisted like a vortex or curly-cue pig tail.  It moved from E to N, crossing over the mouth of the Carson Valley.   At times during its trajectory, it stopped in time and space and as it did so, its particulate trail reduced in length and width.  Finally, it stopped and its tail completely faded, leaving an oval or circle of light that reduced in size until no longer visible.   It was a though the light craft pushed back into space or folded it.  Overall, it seemed to be an oddly slow moving fire ball.;39.1913829875523;-119.753388520057
Flaming Fireball inbound, darkened -reignited, then extinguished while still on low trajectory.;2019-09-17 22:31:00;5 seconds;Flaming Fireball inbound, darkened -reignited, then extinguished while still on low trajectory. Coming home from work in Reno NV, I had just turned southbound on Saliman Rd, South of Fairview Dr.,  mid city Carson City  facing a drk noncomercial area, no business lighting. Heading into a darkened residential area I saw a fireball come into view traveling from southeast direction at eye level in my mid-windshield view, at a roughly 45 degree angle moving south west.  I would say the travel length was about 5-6 inches across my windshield. It was not a pinpoint meteorite type, but a flaming, blueish white object giving off sparks. What was unusual it started to darken as if expiring out, then re-enflamed for another 1-2 seconds  continuing in it's steep decline.  I estimate if it had continued after it extinguished it would have impacted in the Gardnerville Ranchos area, a housing area of homes & ranches at the base of the Sierra foothills.  I did not see any impact flash or claim there was one,  I'm just pinpointing the final phase of the fireball trajectory as it did extinguish slightly above my horizon view of homes maybe a mile in front of me. I am a senior, fully competent Cell phone customer representative & troubleshooter.  I have reported maybe one simaler indicent 20 years ago while living in Burbank CA.;39.1913829875523;-119.753388520057
