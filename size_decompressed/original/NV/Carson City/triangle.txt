As searching for a brighter star to gaze upon, we both visually saw with our eyes not the telescope a fairly large object flying N.N.W..  It had no lights such as an airplane/airliner common for this area.  In color it was a grey to flat black, it made no sound or noise what so ever.   It flew higher than a small plane for this area, and lower than a commercial airliner headed towards reno.  Triangular in shape it was visible for about 10 seconds, moving very very slow.  I tried to focus my telescope on the object.  Then an instant with still no noise it was gone.   Very strange and mysterious................;39.1913829875523;-119.753388520057

It moved from left to right slowly and then hovered for another few minutes.  Before I knew it it was gone.  Vanished into the sky without a trace.;39.1913829875523;-119.753388520057
