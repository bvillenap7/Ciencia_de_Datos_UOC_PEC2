It was round and was noticibly a diffrent shade of black than the sky was it also had a very slight orange tint to it.   We quickly pulled up sky map to see what planet it was.  It did not appear on skymap.  I proceded to watch this object and it began to move slightly northwest in a slow erratic motion that turned and stopped several times then I lost track of it.    If the sun is a hour past setting in the west how can I not clearly see a object that is directly overhead, and I can clearly see, just like the moon.   I believe this object was using the earth's shadow to hide while it navigated through the sky.;39.1913829875523;-119.753388520057
