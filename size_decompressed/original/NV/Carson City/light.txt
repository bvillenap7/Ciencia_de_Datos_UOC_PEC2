A big white light flying across my bedroom window;2008-07-05 23:00:00;5 Seconds;A big white light flying across my bedroom window I was in my room lying in my bed staring at the window for about half an hour. Then I saw one of the most weirdest things in my life. I saw a big white glowing light flying from the bottom left corner of my window to the top right corner.   It flew very fast, I only saw it for about 3-5 seconds, probobly shorter. After I saw it I immediately got up and looked everywhere for the light. I couldn't find anything.   It was very dark outside, no lights, and only a couple of stars (or planets) were out that night. I was shocked. I've been debating over the past two years if it really was a UFO.  And when I saw a show on the history channel of glowing lights flying across the sky at night. I knew it had to be. I've seen shooting stars before but they were nothing like this.  That's about all I have to say. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.1913829875523;-119.753388520057

Went out side at 4:30 am to look for the comet , I saw one light heading from north to south . It looked odd , then two more , followed by three more , then they just kept coming , they all followed the same path . The ones that were close to each other , traveled perfectly together .... It was strange , no sound , they were pretty high up in the air . When i saw the first one , I thought it was a satellite , but I don't think they were all satellites ..... And i couldn't see the comet yet :);39.1913829875523;-119.753388520057

It was not very big that we could tell and it seemed to be darker in color in the middle of it and then a sort of glow surrounding the glowing middle part. The middle was a sort of darkish orange yellow color and the soft glow on the outside was a bit lighter in color more of a yellowish tint. It just kind of hung there almost thought it was a street light, but no it wasn't because it just was hanging there kind of floating or hovering like moving slightly side to side but still remaining in one spot above the field. Unfortunately since we were driving, we could not say how long it had been there before we saw it, nor could we say how long it remained there either. It was a very beautiful soft glowing light. Hopefully will see it again one day!;39.1913829875523;-119.753388520057
