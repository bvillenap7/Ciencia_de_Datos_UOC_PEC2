My co-worker and I were at the gas station early in the morning  on our way to work filling up and making small talk when suddenly he is startled grabs me and says holy crap look pointing above the Sierras due West was a huge fireball.  Just like in the movies. In scale it was about the same size as a dime at arm's length and we could actually see the flames. It was moving similar to the speed of a fast moving aircraft and we estimated it to be about 5 miles away.  It was coming down at about a 30 degree angle and it seemed strange not to hear a loud noise as it disappeared behind the mountains. We had expected an impact but there was nothing.  We both immediately called our wives and told them and had them check the TV news as we continued to work.  We turned on the local news radio in the car but found nothing. I even called the newspaper but they had no other reports and were not! very receptive.  It really seemed like it never happened but it did.  We think the fireball may be in Lake Tahoe or Marlette Lake which would explain the lack of impact but not the lack of reporting.  After a while of looking and listening we just let it go.  It has never been substantiated.  This is the grandest event I have ever witnessed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
