Two football shaped objects, defying gravity, in broad daylight;2008-06-10 11:00:00;30 seconds;two football shaped objects, defying gravity, in broad daylight it was a clear summer day, I was in the garage, when I heard a loud sound, like a jet engine coming to an abrupt stop, and then silence.  I went to the open garage which faces east. and started searching the sky for what I thought was a jet plane.  after maybe about 30 seconds, I saw 2 objects in the sky heading east over the south end of the city.  still no sound.  the 2 objects were like football shape and I could see they were metallic, and looked to have scorching on them.  as I watched in disbelief, the forward of the 2, without stopping forward motion, dropped below and came up behind the one it was leading.   then after a couple of seconds the rear one went over the top and came back directly in front again.  completing a perfect circle.  and they both continued east, again no sound.  now I understand why some witnesses wait so long before going public.  I am along time coast listener, going back to the art bell days.  I always look forward to your reports   Peter, keep up the good work.  people need to know, that we are being visited.
