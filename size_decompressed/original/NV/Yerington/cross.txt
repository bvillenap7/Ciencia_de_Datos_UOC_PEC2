Orange, linear, light that hoovered and danced in the E sky over Yerington, NV.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD));2017-07-09 02:00:00;90 minutes;Orange, linear, light that hoovered and danced in the E sky over Yerington, NV. From 2:00 am to around 3:30 am, there was an orange light that was hoovering.  I thought it was Mars, but then it danced and shot diagonally into the sky before returning into its original location.   ,When I got binoculars out it looked like a plane with the wings offset.  It did not have lights, it was the light.  It was a deep orange color.   After 3:30 am, I finally went to bed and never saw it leave.  It did not reappear the following nights.  It was pretty odd.
