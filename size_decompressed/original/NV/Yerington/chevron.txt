My wife and I were out for a walk. We just happened to be having a conversation about ufo phenomenon. She did not believe me when I told her of some of the things that I had seen in the past. I told her what you look for in the sky. I was explaining to her how they move and etc.. while looking up in the sky. All of a sudden there was a craft that flew overhead. It was totally silent! It was a chevron shaped craft with five lights below. These weren't like landing lights, they were actually large, round in shape and I could see them pretty good. Anyways, the craft was flying about 500 ft overhead heading south with great speed. Then it pulled up and eventually went straight up. As it went straight up I lost sight of it. Needless to say, my wife believes in U.F.O.'s now. To me it was part of living in Nevada. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.9846;-119.1556

With the recent terroism attack, the thought occurred that it was the military getting ready to strike. ((NUFORC Note:  Our first suspicion would have been some kind of high-performance military aircraft, but that probably is not the case if the object was near enough to be seen clearly, but generated no sound.
