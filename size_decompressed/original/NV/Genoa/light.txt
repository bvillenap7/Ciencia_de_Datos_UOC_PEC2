20-30 bright circle white lights moving across sky in straight line.  ((Starlink satellites??));2021-02-17 05:00:00;3 minutes;20-30 bright circle white lights moving across sky in straight line Had to take my dog outside early in the morning a little after 5am when still dark outside. I looked up at the night sky to see two groups of at least 20-30 bright white lights in a straight line. They were moving across the valley in a straight line formation. I couldnâ€™t hear anything. It was a silent night. The lights were very bright and small, a little bigger than the stars. But I could tell they were lower than the stars and it appeared to be 20-30 in a row following each other. After it moved across the valley sky it disappeared.;39.0343;-119.828
