Celendrical object with flashing lights beyond Fernley's West hills;2020-06-10 16:00:00;45 minutes;Celendrical object with flashing lights beyond Fernley's West hills I awoke early and received an email about a package in my mail box. I live on a farm, and the mail box is about 100 yards from the house. As I left my front door, I noticed that the air was very still and it was an exceptionally beautiful calm early morning. The temperature was perfect, I didn't need a sweater. I looked up in the sky and noticed Mars, the red planet near the moon and thought it was so very red and bright. After finishing at the mailbox, while walking the same way, but in the opposite direction, I noticed a blinking calendrical object flashing red, blue, green, yellow, and white lights. It stayed in place hovering beyond the West hills of Fernley. After observing it for about 10 minutes, I found it odd, because it was not moving and just hovering. The night before, there had been unusual activity in the sky over Fernley, and my farm. There were several military helicopters buzzing over my farm, a low jet, and a C130 military plane and those a! re just the ones I noticed... who knows? Regardless, this object just stayed there hovering. I awoke my husband and he joined me to view this object. It stayed in the same spot for 40 minutes while we wondered what this object could possibly be. We used our binoculars to look closer and the lights seemed to be moving around the object. After my husband went back to bed, I continued watching, and it moved very slowly to the North and toward Reno. I thought, good .. go away, your not supposed to be here. It was a little unnerving because I cant explain what it was.;39.6012;-119.2387
