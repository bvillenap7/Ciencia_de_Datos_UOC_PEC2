Traveling S Alt. 50 from Fernley, Nevada, to Silver Springs, NV, I noticed a craft.;2016-05-21 10:13:00;2 minutes;As I was traveling in my car going south bound on Alt. 50 from Fernley, Nevada, to Silver Springs, NV, I noticed a craft traveling from east to west, at about 12 inches from the horizon at 10:13 am. I was about 7 miles south of Fernley at this point.   At first it appeared flat and moving slowly, maybe the speed of an average helicopter.  The object was about three quarters of a mile to a mile and a half away.  As the craft proceeded (the first minute into my observation), the object then banked on its side now moved slightly north east when it revealed its disk shape and very reflective surface from the morning sun.  It was so bright it seemed to be glowing as if white hot.  It seemed to be fixed in that position for approximately 10 seconds before flattening out again to its original position when I first noticed it.  It continued on its East to North East trajectory until it literally vanished 20 seconds later.   I went to a local park/lake (Lahontan recreation area) to call Peter and write this report,   I also witnessed a very low flying military fighter jet coming from the area of the sighting at 11:05 am.  Further notes about the object in question is it was about the size of 15 to 20 writing pen dots.  When it was reflecting the sun light it seems much larger.;39.6012;-119.2387
