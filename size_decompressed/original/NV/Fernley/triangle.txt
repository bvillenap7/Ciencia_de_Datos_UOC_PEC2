Aplane flying by near it and I noticed it was aout 3,000feet higher than the plane. Had a yellowish haze around it that made it seem eerie. It moved in weird way then stopped the rest of the time that I saw it. I was on my way home from Reno to Fernley and when I got about half way there I saw a craft. It was a black triangle craft that had a very strange yellowish haze around it that seemed to be hipmotizing.  A plane was flying overhead and the craft seemed to be approximately 3,000 feet above the plane. It moved in a very odd way. It bobbed up and down like an eagle which is what I thought it was at first. Then the craft stopped very suddenly and just hovered over a mountain. I had my other witness look at it and she could not explain it either. I watched it for the duration time possible. It hovered then I went behind a mountain and could not see it any longer.;39.6012;-119.2387
Three white triangular shaped aircrafts?;2013-04-12 13:00:00;5 minutes;Three white triangular shaped aircrafts? My husband and I were painting my parents house in northern nevada when we both saw 3 white triangular shape fast moving aircrafts?  These left no smoke or anything behind.  We thought they were jets flying together until we saw a jet actually flying in the sky the same time the jet seemed normal but the three white triangle aircrafts seemed a lot higher and faster.  We saw them for about 3 minutes straight until they flew out of our site.this was happening in daylight also about noon!

THREE (3) very bright lights in elongated triangle shape travelling at low speed wink out simultaneously.;2014-11-19 20:05:00;8-10 seconds;THREE (3) very bright lights in elongated triangle shape travelling at low speed wink out simultaneously. Driving home on the street we live on, we watched three (3) very bright yellow/white lights in a stretched elongated triangle pattern traveling parallel to our truck above the roof tops of the houses that line the street and the empty water canal behind these houses.  It looked close to me. a logical guess would be about one eighth mile away and maybe 500 feet in altitude. It traveled parallel with us, but faster than us for 8 to 10 seconds, then all three (3) lights winked out at the same time.  This is why I believe it was one (1) object, not three (3) separate objects. we were driving at 25 MPH.  It's a residential street.  There was no sound from the object what so ever.  If I was to guess the length of the object from the front light to the rearward most light, I would say right at 200 feet long.  It was clear out and we could see the stars.  There was wisps of very faint clouds, but nothing that blocked out the stars.  My wife and I continued driving passed our house and down the road looking for it, but we couldn't find it again. The object was traveling at about 40 mph.  Too slow for an aircraft, plus there was no sound.;39.6012;-119.2387

Then vehicle flew over house I walked further into my yard n watched it fly a little more then either lights went out or it just disappeared.;39.6012;-119.2387
