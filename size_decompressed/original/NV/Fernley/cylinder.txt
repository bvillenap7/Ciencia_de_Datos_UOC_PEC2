I was driving on Shadow Lane eastbound and felt the need to look up.  I saw a cylindrical looking craft emanating a circular pattern of energy.  I pulled over to the side of the road at the cross street of Michaelson right before Rosebud, put the car in park and stepped out to take a look.  It was not moving...was stationary.  It was a lot lower than commercial airplane routes, a lot higher than the helicopters and a bit higher than when the Navy jets fly in at.  It grew really bright, then dimmed and disappeared.  It was sunset and I was wondering if the sun was reflecting off of it.  It was silver and living so close to Fallon Naval Air Station you have to wonder if this is a new experimental craft.  There were no flashing lights, no colored lights...it just got super bright, almost blinding, then dimmed and disappeared.  There was no sound.;39.6012;-119.2387
