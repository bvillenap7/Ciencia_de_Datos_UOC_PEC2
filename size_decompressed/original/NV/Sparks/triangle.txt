I was leaving Nevada Fitness at approximately 5:00pm, the sun had already set and the sky was orange in the background, still lit slightly. Walking west towards my car and looking southwest above the mountain range, I saw an unusual object. It was triangular in shape. The two sides were beams of light bright orange the color of the sun, but the bottom and inside was transparent. About the size of a very large aircraft, it wasn&#8217t moving or if it was it was very slow. I watched it as long as I could but I had to leave. I could see it from the freeway but lost it when I turned North. When I looked for it after that it was gone. The first thing that came to my mind was the Star Trek movie about the whales, when the ships cloaking device didn&#8217t work properly.  Was this craft being camouflaged by the sunset but accidentally became visible?;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
