At 6:30PM on 2-18-15 I saw what I believe was a large UFO, perhaps 8-10 miles east of Sparks, as I was driving home from a store.  There are no homes or businesses or lights in that area, as it is rather in the midst of foothills\mountains.  When I got home I unpacked the car and noticed the rather brilliant light was still in the (clear, cloudless) sky so I grabbed my HX300 20MP camera. Setting was on low light, sharp shoot, which reduces blur and noise automatically.  The camera has a built-in anti-shake function and a zoom of 50x, optical.  The photo’s were taken consecutively but with minor pause between frames as I rest my elbows on the hood of a car. The object was witnessed by another person up until just before the last shot at which point thereafter the object simply blacked out.  Having directly worked with many military and aviation designs, the key matter to me was the fact that there were no strobes or flashing lights about the object – strongly suggesting the object was not a standard military, private, or commercial type of aircraft. Through the lense, the object initially appears as a disc shape, then begins a morphing transition over time which resulted in observations unlike anything I’ve ever witnessed in the past.;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
