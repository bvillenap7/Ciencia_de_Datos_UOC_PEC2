Craftt, appearing much like a star, moved about in the Eastern sky above Sparks, NV, at 23:00 on 6/15/00.;2000-06-15 23:00:00;5 min.;A craft, appearing much like a star, moved about in the Eastern sky above Sparks, NV, at 23:00 on 6/15/00. It was small, though that was because it looked fairly far away.  It was in the East, and singular.  It looked like a star it was whitish-blue, but slightly brighter than a star.  I thought it was a star, until I saw that it was moving.  It moved fairly quickly, in irregular patterns.  The light was constant, not blinking or flashing as would an airplane or something of the like.  It was also moving in patterns that I have never seen anything, natural or manmade, move in. As for my background, I am an advanced student in junior high.  I am known to have a very down-to-earth imagination, and I do not have hallucinations.  I am not known for making things up to try to draw attention to myself.;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
I thought maybe it could be military since the fallon air base was that direction but very odd behavior.;2003-07-20 22:30:00;3 minutes;i thought maybe it could be military since the fallon air base was that direction but very odd behavior. Sparks, Nevada looking southeast there's was at first 2 faint star like lights redish orange in color which were moving together creating an illusion of wing tip lights.  I thought it was an airplane flying until both faint lights began to move in opposite directions.  Then I noticed a new cluster of them slightly north of the original 2 lights.  There were at least a dozen of these very faint reddish orange &quotstars&quot of which some were staying still, and 2 of them moving closer towards the city, stopping, and then travelling in reverse back to the formation.  I went to tell someone, and when we came back, they had vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
Fire Red Bright Light Over Reno Nevada Moving Fast & Darting Right To Left 05/06/12  9:25PM;2012-05-06 21:25:00;4 min;Fire Red Bright Light Over Reno Nevada Moving Fast & Darting Right To Left 05/06/12  9:25PM I opened the front door, looked toward the Nugget twin towers,( towards Reno from Sparks ) immediately noticed a very bright (fire color) red light coming towards me, just to the left of the twin towers. My heart immediately jumped, I asked myself what is that?  It was coming toward me at a high rate of speed.  As it did it was jerking right to left. It appeared to gain speed while moving toward me. I told my oldest boy to come look, and asked him what he thought it could be. He was immediately shocked. Said thats not normal . ( I do see a lot of airplanes since living here 8 months and they do scare me sometimes ) I told him to go to my room and get the camera. He did so. Came back with it. Turned it on and pointed it toward the object coming toward us. Strange thing, at that very moment the object ( or light ) appeared to begin going in the reverse direction. Still moving back and forth at what seems a high rate of speed. Just, in the opposite direction. I told him to try and get the light on screen, at that moment, the video camera read hdd error. My son continued to attempt to get the camera to go into record mode.  As he did the light was moving away at what seems a very high rate of speed. Still moving left to right. I kept my eyes on the light, until it started to fade, then, It just went out. Like a switch was flipped. I searched for the light, could not find it anywhere. At that point the camera did become active in record mode. It was useless at that point. The camera has never read hdd error before this that we know of. Ever. I don't even know why it would do so. No other problems with the camera. (Everio JVC) I know we are a strong nation, but, if we can build aircraft that moves like that, wow, what an accomplishment. Thank you for your time in this matter. I felt the need to report it to you. Others must have seen it as well. Be well. ( As a side note, I am not for nor against the theory of visits from superior beings. It is not my battle. Its what I noticed tonight is all. What sticks in my mind is the feeling I got when I did notice the light. My mind was clear, suddenly consumed, then clear again, when it was gone.) I apologize, I could not get it on camera. Be well.;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
Three separate bright orange lights in the western sky traveling at very high rates of speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Law enforcement report.));2012-12-24 21:15:00;5 minutes;Three separate bright orange lights in the western sky traveling at very high rates of speed. At approximately 2115 on Christmas eve, I went across the street to check the mail.  As I crossed the street, I looked up to the western sky and noticed a bright orange-ish to red colored object.  At first I thought it might be a planet, but realized that it was in the wrong position to be Mars.  As I crossed back to my house, I observed another object rise up from below the visible horizon in the western sky and rise quickly to just below the first object.  At that time I called out my wife and my mom and dad to observe the objects.  The first object faded out and a third object rose up and joined the second one. My father and I are both retired Naval Aviators, and I continue to fly as a law enforcement officer and pilot for the local Sheriff's Office.  I've been flying for 27 years, my father for 28, and neither of us have ever seen these types of lights associated with aircraft before.  They seemed to be traveling at extremely high speeds, almost like rockets.  We did not see any navigational or anti-collision lights on any of the objects.;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053

Then all of a sudden after about a minute the light got smaller then disappeared.  It came back again a few minutes later in the same area appearing again as it did before to be bright orange only to become smaller then disappear.   My 8 year old daughter said she witnessed these same lights the night before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I dont know if Jupiter is still in the night sky but I know it has been.  We couldn't fit the tripod I had to the telescope he had.
