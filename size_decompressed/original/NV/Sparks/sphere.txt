ROUND  METALIC PULSATING BRIGHT OBJECT OVER WINGFIELD SPRINGS (SPARKS) THAT DISAPPEARED THEN REAPPEARED IN DIFFERENT SPOT;2012-06-24 20:10:00;4-10 minutes;ROUND  METALIC PULSATING BRIGHT OBJECT OVER WINGFIELD SPRINGS (SPARKS) THAT DISAPPEARED THEN REAPPEARED IN DIFFERENT SPOT The time was about 8:10 PM in Sparks, NV - I went outside to have a smoke and sat on the porch when I was looking up above the house that is across the street on Poco Beauno in Wingfield Springs in Sparks Nevada. I live on Valliant on a corner house. A metalic spherical object just appeared in the direction I was looking. The object was round in shape and pulsating as it got brighter the pulsating looked to be faster. I was looking up at about 30 degrees. I called over the person that just pulled up at the neighbors house to see it and in the time it took her to walk across the street it faded out like a light being turned off and all the sudden it was gone just like that. As we stood there and I was pointing at where it was it re-appeared lower because it flew out farther from me in a North Eastern direction. The lady saw it again as it got brighter for about a minute and stayed stationary in one spot. The girl came out from the house and the lady I was standing with called her over. By the time she got across the street it faded out again and disappeared.It again re-appeared further out as it was going in the NE direction. We all saw it as it started moving a tiny bit and made a short little white broken up comtrail behind it that was kind of broken up then stopped as the trail stopped behind it and sat stationary again then faded out and disappered in the same position it sat stationary. I got two pictures of it when it was at it's furthest away when I ran up stairs to see if I could see it over the houses.I was talking to my mom on my phone and didnt think at the time it was at it's closest to take a picture of it with my phone (DUMB ME I KNOW). This is the second sighting I have had, the first one was shapped differently. I don't know if our military has any drones that disappear before your eyes that are small. In relative size to a start if you put them side by side it looked to be about 5-8 times bigger then a star. It looked to be about a half mile from my home the first time and about 200 - 300 feet above the house across the street! I don't have a program that does spell ch! eck so sorry if some words are wrong. I type fast too!;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053

Round white sphere moving VERY fast;2021-06-13 19:00:00;10 seconds;Round white sphere moving VERY fast Looked like a Meteor falling to earth, it was not burning out like I expected, it was round and bright white, it then leveled out at about 300' and headed East, gradually gaining altitude.  Speed was well over 1,000 mph.  The entire event lasted less than 10 seconds until it disappeared behind the hills. It was about 10 to 15 miles North of Interstate 80.  From my position it looked about the size of a golf ball, But was probably about 30+' in diameter.  It made no sound that I could hear.  Slight trail when it was falling towards the earth, no trail when it leveled out and headed East.;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
