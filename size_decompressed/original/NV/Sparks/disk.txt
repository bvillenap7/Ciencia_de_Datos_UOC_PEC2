Objects in the sky give terrific light show!!!  (Venus??);2004-08-05 21:00:00;2 hours;Objects in the sky give terrific light show!!! This started as a small white light blip in the sky, north of the city.  As it came closer, the lights changed color and started to splinter off into different pieces, going in different directions.  It was night time so the night sky gave a good background for the many colors.  We looked through a telescope at these objects as they flew in many different directions, and found that they were actually huge round objects with lights going off and on all the way around them.  This show lasted aproximately 2 hours. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus.  PD));39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053

It was tilting, so I was seeing white then metallic.  It was going from west to east, rising as it passed by.  I watched it for a about 2 mins.

Long slender white object.;2011-05-26 04:15:00;ongoing;long slender white object. In the sky a bright white long slender object moving diagonally varrying in length as it moves back and fourth on its path.  It seems to have a sphere of heat waves surrounding the visible white line.  It is moving steadily and never erratic.  A shiny dot appears briefly around the object and then goes away for several min.     When it dissapears behind trees it always comes back in the same place, and has no erratic motion like a kite would,  no appearant strings.      Just saw it fly straight back toward a cloud and dissapear. It keeps getting closer and then further away.   I am baffled;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053

1 disk shaped object seen by 2 witnesses. Emitted yellow, green, red, and blue lights.;2015-08-12 22:15:00;3 minutes;1 disk shaped object seen by 2 witnesses. Emitted yellow, green, red, and blue lights. The object's body was in the shape of a desk, but the peak may have been a cone shape. There two witnesses, myself and one other person.  It was dark so I couldn't see the object very well.  I managed to capture a very low quality picture of it, but you still see the distinct shape of it.  I didn't converse with the other witness. I was afraid he or she assumed I was crazy taking a picture of what looked like a plane from a distance.  After examining the picture I took, I concluded that it was not an airplane nor a helicopter.  It was stationary for a moment and only had yellow lights.   After taking a picture, the lights changed to green, blue, and red colors.  Then, it began to move.  This eliminated the possibility it was an airplane.  Airplanes can't remain stationary in the air for that period of time.  A helicopter doesn't emit the previously mentioned lights. I had to conclude it was a UFO.  I only have one picture.  That is all the evidence I have.;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
Daytime sighting of UFO.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the anomalous object is a bird in flight, with its wings folded.  PD));2019-02-10 10:00:00;Unknown;Daytime sighting of UFO 02/10/2019  While texting a friend that lives in Sparks, Nevad, we were discussing the snowfall and how much had accumulated.  She sent me a picture to show how much snow she had received, only when I received the photo did we both see the UFO.  This was not obvious to her when she took the picture and neither of us knows that it was able to be seen with the naked eye.  The photo was taken on an iPhone. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the anomalous object is a bird in flight, possible a dove or a small hawk, with its wings folded.  PD));39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
