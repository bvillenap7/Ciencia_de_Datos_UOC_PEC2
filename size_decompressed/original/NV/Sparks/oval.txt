About a dozen car-sized silver round objects dance above Sparks Nevada;2011-07-09 10:45:00;2 min;About a dozen car-sized silver round objects dance above Sparks Nevada I was driving on the I 80 Westbound from Vista Blvd to Reno at about 10:40am.  I looked up to the left and saw about 12 silvery-white objects dancing around in the sky.  The object were about 400-500 feet off the ground and danced up and down about another 200 feet.   At first, my kids and I thought they were seagulls, but they were too large and too far off in the distance to be any type of bird plus I saw no wings flapping or gliding.  It was almost like a dozen automobile sized mylar balloons in a tornado 500 hundred feet above the ground but dancing fast almost like play fighting, like dogfighting jets, instead of being flown around like debris.  There were no other objects, debris or dirt in the air.  The radical, fast movements and small cluster made me think it was not a regular aircraft.  The cluster moved out of my sight when I crossed into Reno and due to my kids safety I had to focus on the road.;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
Large, dim, asymetrical and constantly changing shape, faintly colored object, moving from NW to SE.;2012-04-21 20:40:00;4 minutes;Large, dim, asymetrical and constantly changing shape, faintly colored object, moving from NW to SE. Report of an Unidentified Object Over Sparks, Nevada, April 21, 2012 Sky   At approximately 21:30 PDT, April 21, 2012 my wife and I stood outside observing the stars and planets in the clear moonless sky.  She had her iPad so that we could identify the planets the brightest of which we figured was Venus. It was Venus. And then, at approximately 21:40 PDT, I suddenly noticed a large, dimly-visible, ethereal object to the right of Venus, at about 45-degrees above the Northwest horizon moving toward the Southeast at about the rate of speed of a high-flying jet aircraft (or the ISS space station). I next noted that it might be under tow, as a dim dot way ahead of it seemed to be moving at the same speed and direction. (That could have been an unrelated satellite.)  The object would take about four minutes to cross overhead. It was on a steady course and I was able to predict where it would appear after I walked through the house to the front yard.  There we watched it continue on the same path and disappear to the Southeast.  My wife then called a Reno TV Station, and the Fleischman Planetarium at the University of Nevada, Reno but there had been no other reports of phenomena. I would describe it as being asymmetrical and slightly ovoid in shape, with variable shades of pinkish-gray (or pinkish-tan) and was larger than a blimp would appear at 1,000-feet of altitude a half-mile away.   Neither of us heard any sound during its transit of the night sky, and it was a very calm, quiet evening. We searched the internet for clues. I found nothing that would correspond with what I saw.  She went to a NASA website and found the IOTD (Image of the Day) which consisted of three red-and-white parachutes being tested over Arizona by the Orion Test Team.   Could our sighting be a related test? Or was it totally unrelated and will forever remain a mystery to us.;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
