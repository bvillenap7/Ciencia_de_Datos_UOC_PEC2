1small steady light splitting into 6, with circulating lights on bottom.;2004-08-05 22:45:00;2 hours;1small steady light splitting into 6, with circulating lights on bottom. Went out approx 9:45pm to enjoy the evening.  Facing north, I am north and close to the landing pattern of Reno International. I was watching as an airliner was taking off and noticed out of the corner of my eye, a small white dot. I thought it was moving, but thought also that it could be because of the airplane taking off...they were pretty close. As the plane left sight, I noticed that this little white dot was still moving.  As I watched it heading south (in my direction), this little non blinking light lit up into this huge red light.  As it still was heading south, this red light split into two red lights...and from the second red light, it split again...totaling 3 red lights. These lights did not twinkle or have any glare. As I watched and called for everyone to come out to see...these 3 red lights split again becoming 6. Each one of the 6 had red and white lights moving in a circular pattern...and not always consistant. We all (5 adults, one child) watched as these lights cruised around the valley and I noticed that my neighbor was outside and went over and I showed them to her and watched them with her for about 5 minutes. Heading west to Slide mountain area, then south, then east, Virginia City area and Fallon area. At one point there was a HUGE red glow over my neighbors house. We couldn't tell how large or how high it was because the house hid part of it. As I went to go get my camera...it disappered.  From across the street, what we could see was approximatley as wide as a chimney would be.  So it makes me wonder how big it really was.  My husband was watching it through a small telescope and said it wasn't just one large light, but many lights.....and big! He could see the lights and a slight outline of the craft.  We continued to watch the others going all over the sky. I was trying to take a picture, but was having a difficult time trying to focus on any of the lights.  Out of the six frames I took, I did manage to get one with the red glow.  The show/event lasted for approximatley 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The last ones that we seen were heading east.  For the next two days, we also had seen other objects in the sky...mostly in the daylight.  The main one was the following day about 13:00.  Looking south, I was watching a grocery bag that was floating across the sky and as I watched it, something behind it caught my eye.  At first I thought it was one of those high flying planes, but it did not move...it was stationary.  The color was non-reflective and about the same color as a nickle...more dark gray than glowing silver, longated or cigar shape. I watched it for approx 5 min, then went to grab the binoculars and turned around...and it was gone.  Busy skies! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  Some of the lights described seem to us to be not inconsistent with advertising lights.  PD));39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
Looked like a star, but then flew a bit and disappeared out of sight.;2014-07-25 01:20:00;3 seconds;Looked like a star, but then flew a bit and disappeared out of sight. We watched as it looked like a star, but suddenly, out of nowhere it flew about a foot (if measured with a shoe looking in the sky) and disappeared.   We thought a shooting star, but it was not at all a shooting star as it did not clear over the horizon.;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053

We were on 80 passing under 395 and 580 going towards Sparks.  I noticed a light in the distance that was just as bright as the street lamps.  It was getting bigger and looked like a huge falling star so we started to chase it.  As we got closer we noticed it wasn't a falling star.  We thought it was a plane going over the freeway until we got closer to the nugget and it got way too close for comfort.  It was huge, we think either it was an oddly shaped drone, or a UFO.  The lights were extremely bright, and it looked like kind of a saucer shape with big bulbous mounds around it.  It looked to be about 400 feet away from us.  It was really close and I can remember every detail.  There were really small red lights on it too.  And sounds I can't explain.  We were all really scared and everyone started to panic, and then it rose higher and flew away behind the nugget.  I'm still honestly pretty freaked out.;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
Soundless night camo boomerang craft flew slowly over sparks mv;2019-10-30 23:25:00;20 seconds;Soundless night camo boomerang craft flew slowly over sparks mv I was standing outside smoking a cigarette and I looked up and saw a soundless night camo (almost invisible) rounded boomerang shaped craft flying about 500-700ft above. As it moved it blocked out the light from the stars. It flew toward the Pevine mt range. It made absolutely no sound. It was about 50ft wide. It was not moving fast. As it moved the night camo shimmered with a very dull grey/pale green hue. No bright lights at all.;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
