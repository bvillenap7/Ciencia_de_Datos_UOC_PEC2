Group of daytime lights observed in Sparks.;2007-08-24 11:30:00;10 mins;Group of daytime lights observed in Sparks. I had just taken my car into the Jiffy Lube off Prather and was waiting outside because being around noon it was crowded and busy inside.  It was nice out and the sky was sunny and clear.  After a few minutes I noticed something in the sky.  It seemed to be a group of white birds at first glance.  But as I watched I noticed that they were moving in ways that was very unbirdlike.  They stayed in a pretty tight cluster, with none straying away from the group.  After watching for a bit, a worker brought a finished car out and I asked him what he thought it was.  He looked for a bit and said that it was messing with his head and he didn't want to think about it.  He quickly went back to work!  I continued watching and I showed another customer that had come outside.  He quickly dismissed it as a flock of birds.  But he continued watching very intently for several minutes, not very sure of himself.  The group was moving southbound above Sparks.  As they neared, I noticed that it was a group of 20 or so lights....definitely not birds.  It was hard to tell how big they were, but they seemed small.  Some would seem to dim and then get brighter.  It was very peculiar.  I tried to take a picture with my cell phone, but the resolution is too poor to really see anything.  After about 10 minutes in total the cluster moved out of view to the Southeast of my location.  I've seen plenty of bird flocks flying south for winter, or just flying around outside.  But birds have wings...and these were lights.  Lights that were dimming, and then coming back.  I was amazed at how hard it was to see them even though it was nice and clear outside.  You really had to look closely. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053

Stepped onto the back porch last evening, noticed three saucer-shaped craft traveling from south to north.  These things were at some distance from me, two to three miles, at approximately three thousand feet.   Objects were metallic in color, resembled aluminum.  Definitely saucer-shaped, close to twenty feet in diameter, moved rapidly across the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Linear formation of white dots flying at high speed North East towards Pyramid Lake over Spanish Springs.;2020-05-02 21:30:00;30 minutes;Linear formation of white dots flying at high speed North East towards Pyramid Lake over Spanish Springs. Approximately 21:30 began to see 2 circular lights over the East side of the Spanish Springs area. B oth objects were moving very quickly.  One object disappeared after a few seconds. The object following turned immediately back to a northwest heading.  Several minutes later a formation of lights began to appear from the South West area over Lemon Valley.  The lights appeared to be entering the area from a very high altitude and continued in a formation heading North East.  We counted 12 lights in a line formation much closer together than commercial aircraft would fly and a much higher altitude.  The lights would occasionally zig and zag along the same direction.  Other lights would occasionally light up very bright like a camera flash.  All the lights disappeared over the North towards Pyramid Lake area.  We were listen to Live ATC for Reno Tower and NorCal control, there was no, zero nada radio chatter at for any military flights passing through National airspace! control.;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
