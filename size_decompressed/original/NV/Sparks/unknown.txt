Twenty or so little white balls in the sky flying around together. Too high for birds to fly.;2013-07-16 19:40:00;3 minutes;Twenty or so little white balls in the sky flying around together. Too high for birds to fly. It was around 7:40pm PST, I had just came outside to sit down and enjoy the evening.  I set down in my chair and notice that the moon was out so I looked up at the moon.  It is still daylight at this time in Nevada.   I looked to the left of the moon and saw little white objects flying around, my first thought was that it is way too high for birds to be flying.   Then I noticed that the white objects were glowing and smoke was coming out from behind them.   The objects were circling each other and going in and out of sight. I took my phone out to video it but couldn't get them to show up in the picture.   The object starting moving to the left and disappearing, then I noticed that a plane was coming was coming from the right of the object.   After the first plane I noticed two more planes. I live about twenty minutes from Reno Tahoe airport and that flight pattern isnâ€™t one that I see used very much for commercial planes. The event last about three minutes.;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
