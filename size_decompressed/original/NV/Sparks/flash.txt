Red light flashing in a pattern while flying around the perimeter of Reno and Sparks.;2010-04-30 21:00:00;20 minutes;Red light flashing in a pattern while flying around the perimeter of Reno and Sparks. On my way to work at approximately 2100, I was on I80 from Sparks heading to Reno. I make this trip 5 nights a week and have never seen this before. I saw a red light that was blinking and moving around the “bowl” of Reno. It was blinking or flashing in a pattern and the pattern changed between 3 different patterns. The first pattern (only because this is the first pattern when I noticed it) was like a heartbeat, flashing two beats with a pause. I didn’t count how many times this went on before the next pattern, which was just a repeated single flash. The next was a series of three flashes with a very small pause.  I lost sight of it when I turned onto 395 and started heading in the opposite direction. One other thing I should mention, I thought I saw this earlier while having a smoke on my balcony. I live on top of a hill that overlooks the whole valley or bowl of Reno/Sparks. I was having my smoke and looking out over the valley and saw this red light moving against the far hills, flashing. At this time it was moving fast and I lost sight of it when it went behind a hill. It didn’t come out the other side and I didn’t see anything else from my balcony so I just convinced myself it was a helicopter, though I knew even a helicopter has more than just one red light and it doesn’t move that fast…  We have an airport that is in the center of the city and I see planes and helicopters flying around all the time, but this was something different. There were regular planes and jets taking off and landing at the same time that this thing was flying around...;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
