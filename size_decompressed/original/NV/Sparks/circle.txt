They hovered about 3 feet from the ground, spaced 1 foot apart from each other and in perfect formation together. They eventually glided away over the hillside with no sound.;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
Red light;2004-05-29 22:00:00;40 seconds;I was sitting outside in my backyard in sparks which is just north of reno when i noticed this red light come into view from southeast flying over reno at about 500 feet.  It cut across reno and part of sparks and then cut west and headed off towards california and faded from view.  Never changed colors always red even as it was going away from me which makes me think it wasnt a plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD));39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
Bright white circle object that dimed and started to blink red and white, dissapeared!;2004-07-05 23:00:00;6 minutes;Bright white circle object that dimed and started to blink red and white, dissapeared! I was in my room on the computer with the blinds shut. All of the sudden a white light outside appeared pretty bright. I open the blinds and saw that it looked like a star. I compared it to other stars but this one was much brighter and more low. I went and got my relatives. It started out pretty bright, it dimed, it flashed red. It then looked like it was moving north, but then it looked like it was coming towards us for like 10 seconds, then went north. It was moving pretty slow, and then it moved pretty fast and dissapeared.;39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
On a crystal clear winter night, I watched a bright blue ball descend at about a 35-degree angle west of our house.;2013-12-21 20:50:00;2-3 seconds;On a crystal clear winter night, I watched a bright blue ball descend at about a 35-degree angle west of our house. Last night, between 8:45 and 9:00 p.m., my husband and I went out to our hot tub in our back yard.  We live in Spanish Springs, in Sparks, NV.  It was crystal clear out, and we were star-gazing, as is our habit while hot-tubbing, when I happened to look toward the west-southwest. A bright blue, lit ball was descending in the western sky.  The blue was a true blue.  From the horizon line, it caught my eye when it was at about 30 to 45 degrees up, and heading down from right to left at that angle range. When I say it was big, from where I stood--because the sight of it brought me up from a sitting position to my feet--it's challenging to describe, because of its distance.  But I'll do so in terms relative to the house behind which I lost sight of it.  The neighbor's house is about 700 to 1,000 feet away, separated by open horse property between us. The bright, blue ball was roughly the size and shape of a doubled basketball.  In other words, it like an extra-large basketball compared to the house. It moved slower than a shooting star, remaining bright blue for the two to three seconds that I watched it until the house blocked its view. I don't know if there were any sounds accompanying its descent, because the hot tub jets were fully on and noisy, but there was no impact noise or boom or anything. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) It was a third to a half the size of a full moon.  The night was nice and dark, making for good contrasts.   --((witness name deleted))   P.S. I know last night you said you thought the helicopter we saw a few minutes afterward was unrelated to the bright blue ball, but I tend to think it was looking for it.  I have no way to prove this, however.  ((END ADDENDUM));39.5852233552631;-119.719593421053
