There was black smoke from the flying unit.  Wispy black smoke, not like it was on fire. It seemed rather low and loud for a private plane or jet. It curved around a mountain in front of me and I lost track of it. It was low but not so low that it was ‘right on top of me’ My gut was this was some military missle.  I wondered if it was a small plane/jet.  But a)I didn’t see wings (I recognize I could’ve missed this)  b) I usually don’t hear that kind of sound with a small plane/jet  c)  It seemed to be moving pretty fast as low  as I thought it was compared to a small plane/jet. Wondering what it was and if anyone else saw it.;40.6219;-116.9501
