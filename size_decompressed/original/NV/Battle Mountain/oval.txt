TRAVELING IN MY TRAILER..GOING FROM BATTLE MOUNTAIN NEVADA TO AUSTIN NEVADA,..HWY 95 SOUTH OF CITY OF BATTLE MOUNTAIN ...I SAW TWO BIG BRIGHT INCANDENSCENT LIGHTS COMING FROM TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN RANGE DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF OF THE MOUNTAIN...THERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE THIS MOUNTAIN THE 2 LIGHTS WERE ILLUMINATING THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL..SUDDENLY , ONE OF THE LIGHT MOVED AT THE GREAT SPEED AND THERE IS THE LIGHT LOOKING AT ME ..I WAS OBSERVING THE CRAZY THING FROM THE ROAD AS I WAS LOOKING TO THE MOUNTAIN..THEN THE LIGHT STOOD STILL...I COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING ELSE..JUST THE LIGHT..NO SOUND --NOTHING ..JUST THE LIGHT KIND OF LOOKING AT ME...THEN AS IT SUDDENLY CAME TO ME THIS LIGHT LEFT MY PRESENCE AND BACK TO THE FOOTHILL OF THE MOUNTAIN TO JOIN THE OTHER LIGHT....I CALLED MY WIFE ...I TOLD HER WHAT I HAD SEEN...INCREDIBLE... NOW AS I LOOKED BEHIND MY TRAILER THERE IS ANOTHER LIGHT..LIKE CHECKING ME OUT...THEN SUDDENLY IT DISAPPEARED IN THE NIGHT  SKY.....BUT THERE IS MORE!  NOW A FEW MINUTES WENT BY AND EVERYTHING WAS TOTALLY DARK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT..THEN THE MOST STRANGE WAS HAPPENING....NO ONE WILL BELIEVE WHAT I SAW THEN.. THE ONLY WAY I CAN DESCRIBE THIS EVENT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT AT NIGHT ..BETWEEN THE ROAD I WAS TRAVELING THE THE MOUNTAIN WHERE THE LIGHTS WERE AT ONE TIME..I SAW THESE SMALL CRAFTS..LOOKED LIKE BUMPER CARS WITH LIGHTS IN FRONT AND LIGHTS IN BACK...I STILL DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE LITTLE CRAFTS WERE FLYING IN MID-SPACE BETWEEN THE MOUNTAIN AND THE ROAD WHERE I WAS PARKED...THESE SMALL CRAFTS LOOKED LIKE BUMPER CARS THE ONE THAT YOU TAKE YOUR KINDS IN AN AMUSEMENT PARK...THESE LITTLE CARS WERE FLYING IN MID-HEAVEN JUST BELOW THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN IN FRONT OF ME....THEN I FOLLOWED THESE THINGS FLYING AND SUDDENLY IT DISAPPEARED IN BETWEEN A CANYON...THEN A FEW MINUTES LATER ..ANOTHER SET OF (LETS CALL THEM ..BUMPER CARS) flying in mid-space following the pattern of flight as the first set of bumper cars...Wow, what an experience!  One experience that I will never forget....THIS WAS TOTALLY WEIRD... I AM NOT CRAZY...I WAS NOT ON DRUGS OR DRINKING ALCOHOL...NO ONE WILL BELIEVE WHAT I SAW..... I AM RETIRED NOW FROM A CONSTRUCTION FIRM THAT I  HAVE HAD FOR OVER 30 YEARS....I HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE...I AM NOT CRAZY.....I SAW WHAT I SAW ..AND THAT IS ITâ€¦;40.6219;-116.9501
