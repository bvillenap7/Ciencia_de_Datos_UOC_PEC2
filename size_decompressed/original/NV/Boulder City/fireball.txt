I don't think it was a craft it was a meteor, but with a red tail, it was splitting apart, and it looked like to me was electronic material because it was flashing like if it was a plane.   So I'm thinking it might be a  satellite, or maybe it's light reflecting, because it could of came from warm wood releasing the iron if anyone knows what I'm talking about it's an object bigger than Jupiter.  I don't know if I can call it a planet.  Anyway that's my observation. ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris.  PD));35.9726;-114.8356
