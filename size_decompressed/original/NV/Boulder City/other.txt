Loss of time and a night I need to tell.;1999-05-24 19:00:00;12 hours;Loss of time and a night I need to tell. Subject: Loss of time!    In the late 90's, when there was a sphere over Las Vegas, a friend and I experienced MULTIPLE U.F.O.'s of all shapes.  I am scared to write this. When a friend and I got done working for the day we left from Vegas on our way back to Kingman, it was dark and late , we just passed thru Boulder heading down the long road to the dam. We were talking about what to do the next day about work when the truck lights and radio flickered and went off.  Then the truck stalled.  I laughed and said,  Oh no, aliens.  The truck kept rolling down the street, even tho stalled. After a few seconds we looked at each other then looked up thru our windshield.  There it was right above us. We could barely see it.  But with the light of the moon we can see the shadow, just hovering above us.  Way too close!!!  Then it was gone. The truck started and we pulled over to the left on a dirt road and went back about 1/4 off the road. My heart was pounding, my hands are tingling still as i write this.  We just looked at eachother . He said You seen that right? I said Yes.,breathless. We talked a few just staring at the sky.  We decided to just stay there for the night. We were there about an hr when we started seeing a flicker of light slowly coming across the sky.  It was small like a star but moved slowly flickering off and on like it was stalling or the engine was failing.  Then all of a sudden it got to a star (or we thought it was a star). We saw the little one line up under the brighter one and then all of a sudden there was a line barely noticeable from the one to the other. The bigger brighter one slowly lifted up the flickering one until it disappeared. Then it just stayed there, like a star that was supposed to be there. I don't know how long we sat there until we noticed more lights of red and yellow and white colors just sitting above the mountain beside us. It was HUGE. It went from one side of the mountain to the other just hovering above it. Lights just blinking. We were paying so much attention that i barely noticed the lights on the ground in front of us. I seen half circle lights that were red green and orange floating on the ground about 20-30 feet ahead of the truck. At first I thought street stop lights. But there was no lights in our area.these moved very slow and as I looked closer they were moving behind the bushes. I can see the bushes in front of them. There was at least 10 of them moving slow and bright but not that bright. I was scared, VERY SCARED! We watched them for a few minutes, actually a long few minutes. In our old pick up truck we had no lining on our inside roof. All of a sudden there was a flash like a photograph behind us to where we could see our shadows of our heads on the ceiling. I turned to look and there was another one. I saw 5 yellow squares that seemed to be part of another craft. Barely moving up in the sky about 100 ft up and 100 feet back from us. It had 2 yellow squares on top and 3 on bottom. I told him to look. He did. Now I was beyond scared! It just sat there floating back and forth. I was so scared I just started blurting out, Oh my god we got to go. I screamed, We gotta go!,I love you we gotta go! But we didn't not move. We just watched. It seemed forever. We did not want to go to sleep. Then I felt like my body was going to vibrate. We had nowhere to go they were all around. I looked in front of the truck again to see how close the ones on the ground were getting closer they were. They were small tho. Only about 1-2 feet long and about 1 ft tall. Just then this bright light shot out of behind this side of the cliff behind them and just stopped. It was maybe 50 ft off the ground about a football field ahead of us. I froze. We felt like it was just staring at us. My friend grabbed his 500 candle flood light from behind the seat. He wanted to get out and shine the light on it. I FREAKED OUT!!!! He opened his door and stood on the door frame and shined the light on the thing. It looked like a very shiny silver bell. Like the kind you ring on the counter at a store for service. Then it started to move towards us. I screamed and started crying. He jumped back in the truck we locked the doors. I don't remember if all the other lights were still there. We watched it for hrs it seems It just stayed there and moved very slowly upward. VERY SLOWLY! Almost to where you couldn't notice. The next thing I remember is waking up laying with my head on his lap and he was waking up with his hands on the wheel sitting as if he was driving and it was morning. Not just morning.....the sun has been up for hrs. We went back to Vegas to go to work. We told two friends. They joked saying I could be pregnant. We told no one else.  There was a lot of talk in Vegas. About a flying silver cigar just hovering over the city. We knew it was the same craft as the one we seen come from behind the mountain.    Later that day we started back to Kingman again . We decided to stop by the spot that it happened. When we got close to it we saw 12 black helicopters directly over the sight where our truck was parked. We slowed down. It was weird. Now we know we didn't imagine it. This was proof. there was 3 helicopters side by side going north to south. 3 going south to north. Going in between each other , combing. Then the other six doing the same from west to east and east to west. But they were just over that area that we seen all of it.    We pulled over further up the road and got out. We saw what looked like impressions of crutch bottoms all over the sides of the road.  We got back in the truck. Continued on to kingman. We went and rented a camping spot in the Hualapai mountains to clear our heads and of course watch the skies.  In the morning we were packing up and this black suv came by our camping spot moving very slow. All the windows even the windshield was dark. We just seen shadows of four men. They left. We got a little freaked out. So about a half hr later we were heading down the mountain into kingman when we saw it again It was pulled off to the side of the road and someone was standing out on the passenger side. But I couldn't see him the back door was open and blocked everything of him except his shiny black dress shoes and black pants. As we went by I turned to see if I can catch a glimpse. He seemed to turn exactly the same time our truck passed. But I saw his stature. He was a broad shouldered man with dark hair. He had on a white dress shirt and black suspenders. When we got further away he jumped in the suv. I still saw nothing of the inside or of the other men in the vehicle. It was all limousine black tinted out.     Since that night and the day with the suv. I still see the suv. But not often. Just every other year or so. Just sitting in a parking lot when i am shopping and when i go to look at it after I get in my vehicle its gone.   Since this occured my friend has shot himself in the head, but survived. I don't know if he remembers the incident or not. I think he is lucky if not. Me.......I sometimes have to take pills to go to sleep. 1 time I woke up on my bed in the middle of the day not remembering how I got there, screaming my ex husbands name because I couldn't move. It felt like someone was holding me down just by my forehead. I screamed and screamed but nothing came out. Then it was over.    I still feel sometimes a numbing starting in my head and feeling like I'm going to become paralyzed again. I have constant ringing in my ears. When I wake up in the morning for the first few minutes before I'm fully awake, I hear what sounds like morse code. I don't even know morse code.    Well that's my experience. I went thru my stress again telling it. My hands are numb and my hearts racing. But I do feel some release telling it. In a way I want to know what happened in our lost time. I was looking for hypnotists to know. Then again who do I tell.        Thank You for Listening.;35.9726;-114.8356
Tube-like with spherical body.  ((anonymous report));2019-08-01 00:00:00;19:55;Tube-like with spherical body. The day was clear with high scattered clouds.  I left the local grocery store and went to my car.  I always look up at the sky at the clouds.  They were scattered and big and fluffy towards the southwest.  I saw a commercial jet coming from the north (Las Vegas) heading south as if it had just taken off from the airport.  Very low.  I watched it and as it got about 11 o'clock,  almost above me I saw a Long tube like object with a smaller silver sphere in the front, a very large sphere in the middle and a more squared off section in the back.  The center sphere had a large ring around it that appeared separate from the sphere.  The back squared off portion appeared to have smaller ports of some kind on the back.  It appeared right behind the plane I had been watching and it was significantly larger than the plane. I tried to get my phone out to take a photo but it was moving and as it moved it appeared to blank out in places and while I could still see it shining,  I could not make its outline out or see it clearly anymore.  By the time I got a photo it was only a tiny dot.  It moved way quicker than the plane was moving.  I did draw a photo of what I saw.

Government transports possible hidden ufo, ((NUFORC Note:  Good video footage suggests a terrestrial space vehicle.  PD));2019-10-08 02:00:00;~1 hour;Government transports possible hidden ufo, near Area 51 heading from Boulder to kingman arizonia with DPS police escort The ship itself was covered in a dark black tarp on a big truck-bed escorted in front and behind by about 10-20 cops in a convoy spreading about a mile on the road.  The ship looked extremely ridged and weird and clearly looked like something that would fly, but looked way to weird to be any type of military plane or anything I know.  I’m not one to jump to conclusions but the minute  I saw the convoy and what looked like a hidden ship after we had just passed Area 51 I thought it might be something.  The cops escorting the craft were DPS arizonia highway patrol and they were heading from Nevada to arizonia, specifically one of the roads between Boulder City and kingman arizonia (therefore they traveled all the way from arizonia to Nevada to escort whatever was under the tarp to arizonia).I have multiple videos I took along the way since they were on the same road as us, if interested please contact me. The last detail I thought was interesting was when I resea! rched the DPS I found out they are the department of public safety, kind of an odd name for a division of cops that may be moving a UFO, possibly another agency blending in as a subdivision of cops? Let me know what you think!;35.9726;-114.8356
