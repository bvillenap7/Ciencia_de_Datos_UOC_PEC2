It never gets  very high over the mountain ridge line.  It is always over the same spot never really moves left or right.  It is up for about 5 minutes then goes back down over the mountain and then returns 5 minutes later.  It is a white light that occasionally has a faint red and green flash.  This has occurred 3 nights in a row 11/4, 11/5,  and 11/6. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??
