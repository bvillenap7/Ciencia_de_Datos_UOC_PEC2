Bright red/orange lights in the greater Las Vegas area;2008-05-16 20:00:00;5 min;Bright red/orange lights in the greater Las Vegas area At sunset, I was sitting outside enjoying the evening and when I looked up I saw a very bright orange almost red light in the sky north of Boulder City, NV. At first I thought it might be a very strange colored bright red star and thought that would be odd since I had never seen anything like it.  Then it started to move north slowly (maybe 2 or 3 minute duration).  I think it blinked a few times before fading completely. Then I noticed another traveling a lot faster from west to east but was only able to watch it for several seconds before that one dimmed and faded. I looked hard to see if this was a refection from the sun off of a couple of planes, but I could see nothing at all in the exact area after they faded. I did notice after the second light faded, further east, my eyes caught a black/dark object in the sky with no lights on and it was cigar shaped.  Could have been a plane but I didn't hear any noise from it or see lights. All these objects seemed to be very high up but I am not a good judge of distance. I didn't think much of it with all the hoaxes around but it certainly was entertaining for the time being.  It certainly was unidentified to me!;35.9726;-114.8356
