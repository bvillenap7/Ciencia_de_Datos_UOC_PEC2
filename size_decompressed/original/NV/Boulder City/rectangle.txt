Square/rectangular object seen over mountains during the day.;2009-08-29 12:00:00;3-5 minutes;Square/rectangular object seen over mountains during the day. I am writing this so I don't forget the event years from now.   It was Saturday August 29, 2009.  On my way out of Boulder City, Nevada, at approximately 12 noon PST I saw a motionless object in the sky.  It was located over the Mountains as you drive on Veteran's Memorial Parkway heady out of town.  The object was darker than the hazy afternoon sky and appeared to be square in shape.  It had definite lines and was not a cloud.  When I first saw it I thought it was a kite or something caught in a power line as I tried to judge my depth perception.   As I continued driving I watched it sitting motionless.  It became more apparent that this was actually something in the sky above the mountains and not some sort of optical illusion. I watched the object as I was parked at the stoplight at Boulder Highway and Veteran's Memorial Parkway.  I was anxious to get a better look at it by getting on the highway.   Before the light changed to green the object start to move.  It moved away very smoothly and disappeared into the hazy cloud cover.  It gradually disappeared almost like fading away.  It was moving towards the Las Vegas valley when I lost site of it.   As I drove into Henderson I looked to the sky but there was no site of it.  Though its hard to be sure, it appeared to be very large in size.   I don't know what I saw that day but I will never forget it.;35.9726;-114.8356
