Fast moving object on NV - CA state line.;2012-06-22 20:48:00;30 seconds;Fast moving object on NV - CA state line. I was outside at sunset looking at the moon in the western sky from Pahrump, NV at approx. 20:48 PST on 06/22/2012 and I noticed a very small object in the distance above the moon descending at an incredible rate of speed straight down from above the moon. It had no light of its own, but appeared to be reflecting light from the sunset. It was very far away and I could not make out a definite shape. It flew straight down then took a sudden turn to the south across the skyline for a great distance and then quickly turned west and disappeared across the mountains into CA. This object was definitely maneuvering, moving extremely fast and appeared to maintain a constant speed. Compared to aircraft I see frequently, this object had to be traveling several thousand miles per hour.;36.1773466666667;-116.00878
