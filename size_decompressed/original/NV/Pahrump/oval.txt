Very Bright Circle;2020-02-07 17:00:00;10;Very Bright Circle I noticed a very bright light sitting low in the north-west sky...I took my binoculars and witnessed this:  It was a large oval circle with round bright circles that were the on the edge of the circle with the inside full of smaller ones like sparklers that keep moving all around and creating dark holes....like a moving cell under a microscope, then the oval circle would also move sideways shaping into a flat disc and then oval again....;36.1773466666667;-116.00878
