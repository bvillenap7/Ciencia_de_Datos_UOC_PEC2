Green light in the sky;2011-09-14 19:45:00;30-45 seconds;Green light in the sky I am a law enforcement dispatcher.  We had 2 simultaneous reports of a green light moving slow across the sky (west to east) and the first reporting party said they were sure the object (whatever it was) came down.  And they were in a panic. I asked if they thought it could be a meteor and they said no, it was moving too slow.  We didn't take the report too seriously until one of our deputies being dispatched to the area said he saw it too.  All of them said it was green.  Although the deputies could find nothing in the area, obviously something was in the sky!  Our main concern was a possible aircraft down, but again, nothing was found. Please do not publish my name as my employer might not be too pleased, and since this is a very small town, it would not be too hard to figure out who reported it!;36.1773466666667;-116.00878
Two pin spot lights bridged my a red or orange connecter.  Lights switched brighter on me.;2014-07-06 22:01:00;1 minute;Two pin spot lights bridged my a red or orange connecter.  Lights switched brighter on me. At 22:00 I went out to close my gate and when I turned around facing south I looked up on the night sky and saw what looked like two pin spots coming toward me.   Since I don't know how big the craft was I can only say that as I now put my hands out in front of me and say the two lights were this far apart the distance between my hands would be about one foot.    The lights switched to brighter as if to check me out and I immediately turned my flash light on it, the lights went back the level they were, and it turned around and headed south.  As it flew away I could see some light blinking.    I could not tell what the shape of the craft was, but the two lights were bridged together by an orange or red line.  It made no sound that I could hear.   The blinking light leads me to believe that the craft was in compliance with that FAA regulation so might likely be a man=made drone.   To the west of it I did see what looked like an ink spot over a square sha! pe that looked like a picture frame.  Never saw anything like that before.;36.1773466666667;-116.00878
