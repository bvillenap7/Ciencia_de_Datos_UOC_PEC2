My wife comes in the house saying something strange is outside. She saw it at close range with many strobe-like lights and flying slowly and silently. She said she could not move until the craft went west over the mountain behind our house,into  California .we went outside looking in the direction of the moutain, a few moments went by at which point the craft slowly rose up from behind the mountain with one light shining forward and sweeping very slowly side to side. In the moonlight it had a wok-like silhouette. The craft moved slowly toward us I began to get concerned,I sent my daughter in the house. The craft then went straigt up and sped off silently  East toward las vegas. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.1773466666667;-116.00878
