Reentry followed by multiple lights hovering above city;2012-11-07 18:15:00;20 minutes;Reentry followed by multiple lights hovering above city Witnesses: 2 adults, both sober, driving from Bishop, CA to Tonopah, NV. I am retired  Both wife and I are ex-aerospace, and I am a pilot. Date: 11/7/2012 Time: 6:15-6: 30 PM  Location-Central Nevada Weather-clear stars, starlight night. Dark. No wind. No clouds. No dust in the air. Sightings (flap?): Driving from Bishop, CA to Tonopah, NV:  We approached Coledale Junction. I slowed and made the turn  from Hwy 6 onto Hwy 95.  I then saw a bright white light to my left. It was a craft flying less than 200 knots and in low level flight.  I assumed it was a training jet, or general aviation plane running North on Hwy 95 (towards Reno).  I  estimate that it was 2000 Ft. AGL, or lower. As it came abreast of the car and off into the desert ¼ mile east of the hwy, it turned into an orange glow and then dispersed in a shower of sparks like a meteor and trailed a comet-like tail and then burned up in level flight and was gone.  By the time I alerted my wife-she missed it. It was low and on the driver’s side of the car.  I assumed I saw a meteorite coming in-but was mystified by the slow, level flight pattern. Then as we progressed Southbound on Hwy 95 towards Tonopah, I saw an orange circular light around two hand spans high in the windshield above the lights of Tonopah-some 12 miles distant & high above the twinkling lights of Tonopah.  This was perhaps 7 minutes after the first sighting. I called attention to it and My Wife saw it too.  Then another orange glowing orb appeared to the right of the first one.  They were both spread out and at the same elevation-the distance of separation was the full width of windshield.  First the left one snapped shut-turned off.  Then the Right one went out. We both watched this. As we approached our turn on Gabbs Pole Line road, these orange lights re-appeared-first the left one, then the right. It seemed they were stationary and in the same location still.  High above Tonopah. They stayed illuminated perhaps 20 seconds, then vanished in the same order.  We both saw these again. We are around 70 Miles bee line from Area 51, and 35 Miles from TTR facility on the test range. That’s it!;38.0654;-117.2325
Three amber lights slowly faded in and out twice.;2019-11-20 19:00:00;10 seconds;Three amber lights slowly faded in and out twice. Three maybe four large amber lights that slowly faded in and faded out.  Did it twice.  Each time lasting about four or five seconds.  The lights were right next to each other but were separate.;38.0654;-117.2325
