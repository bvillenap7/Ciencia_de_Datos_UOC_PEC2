chevron shaped dark object with flourescent lites;1995-10-18 03:00:00;1 minute;Summary : chevron shaped dark object with flourescent lites i was driving my tractor trailer east bound I10 towards phoenix in november of 95 at 0300 hr's on the 18th when about 3 miles in front of me just above the highway i saw 3 lites moving.at first i thought it might be a car going across an over pass at an exit.as i looked closer i realized there was no cross over exit ahead.the lites disappeared,when all of a sudden just off to the south side of the highway and 60 feet above the shoulder there was a brite lite that came on and shown on my truck.than 2 more lites came on and than went out.the object at this point was banking to it's left as it approached. ilooked at the craft and could make out it's shape as that of a chevron or similar to the b-2 bomber.now i was traveling at 65 mph as the object leveled out from it's bank.i could see 2 flourescent colored lites on each end of the craft one was a soft but brite blue green in color and the other was brite red that glowed with smooth even luminence.there were no markings and i h!ave an air controlled passenger window which i put down to listen for engine noise.there was no sound other than the wind as i drove towards the craft.this object when first seen banking towards me and heading in a westerly direction did not go by as an object traveling as a on coming object ,rather it seemed to go by very slowly as if it was in reverse and going just a few miles per hour slower than my truck.i still had the window down as i passed the craft and still could not hear an engine noise.as i went past it i looked in my out side mirror on the passenger side and could still see the out line of the craft as it moved on in a western path still off the shoulder of the interstate.
