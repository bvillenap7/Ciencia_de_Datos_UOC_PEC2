Cigar shape with 3 bright red/orange circles inside instantly appeared and 5 sec. later i We saw while heading South, about 10 miles NE of Tonopah Nevada.  What appeared directly in front of our car about 2-3 miles ahead and about 400 feet off the road.  A cigar shape with 3 bright red/orange circles inside the cigar shape outline.  They looked liked the rear exhaust end of a jet engine at night.  The object appeared and then 5 secs. later totally instantly disappeared.  It never moved then just gone. This was observed clearly by my Wife and Myself. We are both 50 years old don't drink and have always been a little sceptical in regards to UFO's.  Anyway once we got to Tonopah we discussed with a clerk at the gas station.  We were then told about Area 51 which is adjacent to the area we observed the UFO in.  I would be interested to know if there were any other sightings that night in this general vicinity.;38.0654;-117.2325
