Traveling across desert by car heading to Tonopah NV, witnessed ongoing glowing ember, fire like lights on desert horizon.  Continued to see glowing orange pulsating, almost like a continuous slow moving fire on the desert horizon. Had jellyfish blinking pulsating tendrils that cascaded down within glowing light formation. Moved along horizon for almost 1 hour. Both of us over 50 years of age and cannot explain.;38.0654;-117.2325
