At first we seen this ball of light get real bright in the sky below the mountain line. We were traveling on 95 south to las vegas nv from Tonopah nv.  It kept following us going south. Then it split into three crafts, and then the lights went off.  Then it kept following us as just one, and would sometimes light up.  Then it split into 4 crafts, and lights up, and then back to one.  Then one last time into five crafts and back to one.  It easily followed us up till we were at Beautty, NV. I flashed my lights at it in a 3,4,5 method.  The one craft lit up.  We then seen it move over us.  Just when we were about to enter Beautty, NV, the truck became lit up by a yellow neon dim light. I can assure you I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I am not saying it is alien, but I am not able to indentify it. Myself I am a real estate investor and business owner.  My 95 year old military AF veteran father was in the car and seen it, along with my son at 25 who works on our family business. I was traveling in a F 350 2012. I do not drink, do drugs, or take medicine of any kind.  I can assure you I am not trying to waste your time.  Later that evening upon arriving at my home in Las Vegas, I told my business partner and friend, a military veteran of 20 years by the way.  All of my family heard like a loud whisper that night. I did not sleep very well at all as I kept watch over everyone.;38.0654;-117.2325
