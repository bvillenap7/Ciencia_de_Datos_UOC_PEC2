Fireballs southwest/southeast Tonopah.;2014-04-28 21:30:00;3 hours;Fireballs southwest/southeast tonopah I have been living in Tonopah now since November, and have witnessed many bright Orange lights over the S/SE/SW area near the nuclear power campus, these lights fade into view stick around for at least 3-10 minutes and fade back out (lasting three hours last night alone (4/28/14))  Some times there are as many a 5 at a time, often seeming to drop behind the hills and light up the basin.  Is it possible that you may be able to shed some light (no pun intended) on this subject matter?  I think it could possibly be Military Drone training, due to the fact that we see fighter jets going towards the general direction of the lights only to return after they are out.
