My daughter SCREAMED 'LOOK DADDY LOOK, ALIENS'(She's only 3 1/2.) Looked out in the back yard in the hills behind the house. Noticed a BRITE WHITE  OVAL OBJECT hovering around the hills. We live approx. 30 miles from FALLON NAS. thought it was a helicopter but object made NO SOUND. Object hovered for a while but soon disapeaerd in a blink of an eye. My Daughter was the first to see this, she was dancing and cheering but has not mentioned the incident since. the object seemed as if it was looking for something. Tried listening for a noise, the hills areonly 1 mile from my backyard(if that).;39.282;-119.528
