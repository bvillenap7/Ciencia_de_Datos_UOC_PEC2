White Dot Lights (WDL) that Flash seen over Dayton, Nevada;2020-05-05 05:15:00;1 minute;White Dot Lights (WDL) that Flash seen over Dayton, Nevada As I walked outside, at approximately 05:15am, something caught my eye. When I looked up at the morning sky (still dark, Sun light was rising in the eastern horizon) I saw multible small, dim White Dot Lights (WDL) moving around in a small area. Then, one of those Dot Lights would instantly flash bright for a couple seconds, at the end of the flash, I could see a couple dim White Dot Lights moving away from the flash area. Those dim White Dot Lights, after a couple secounds, would disappear. Then multiple dim Dot Lights would appear close to wear I saw the first set of lights. And those lights did the same thing. Then it happened again, then again. So I ran inside the to grab my cell to record it, and couldn't see any more going outside. This all happened in small patch of the sky, looking streight up and slightly to the North.  DISCRIPTION: the dim Dot Lights looked the same as a dim star at night. The bright flash was slightly brighter than the brightest star in the night sky. Anyway, I saw this. It was quick. It ended. And now going on with the rest of my life .... cheers!;39.282;-119.528
