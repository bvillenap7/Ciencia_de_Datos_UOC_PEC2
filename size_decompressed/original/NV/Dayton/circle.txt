My wife and I were in the backyard stargazing.  My wife pointed out what looked like two faint stars east of the moon that were not there a minute ago.  They were motionless for about a minute and were increasing in brightness.  At that point I thought they were two planes heading toward us.  Then they started to rotate around a center point, very slowly at first then increasing in speed but continued around a center point.  That didn't seem plane like, definitely not stars.  Then the lights disappeared suddenly.  We are in an area of military bases.;39.282;-119.528
