Orange orb size of a silver dollar in my rearview mirror.  Followed for miles.  It would change shapes from round,triangular and square.  It would melt into each different shape.  As it was happening our GPS went crazy.  Cellphones both had different  times.  Very strange to be followed by this.  Very bright orange.;40.9685951219512;-117.750834146341
