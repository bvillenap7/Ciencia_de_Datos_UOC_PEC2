PD)) We spotted a beam of light coming from a bright circle, that left a green residue in the sky. My friends and I spotted a light that kind of looked like a spotlighting helicopter.  There was a huge flat light coming out of a little circle in the sky.  It looked as if it was spotlighting houses.  It was moving around.  At first we thought it was a helicopter, but when we got out of the car, you couln't hear anything.  The circle turned into an oval, and then into a little slit where the light was coming from.  Then, it looked like it turned around, and the source dissapeared.  The light was still shining down, but it began to fade, and seemed to dissapate into the air.  The light turned into what looked like a greenish teal residue, and then slowly faded.  The source was really far away, but the light was very big, so it's hard to believe it was a helicopter.;40.9685951219512;-117.750834146341

Four unexplained bright white lights appeared in the sky tonight over Winnemucca, Nevada.;2016-07-31 20:30:00;20 minutes;Four unexplained bright white lights appeared in the sky tonight over Winnemucca, Nevada. Myself, my daughter, her husband, and my three grand kids, 7, 10 and 11, just witnessed three bright white lights appear in the sky over Winnemucca, NV, at approximately 8:30 pm, as we were looking North.   Three just appeared.  Two were moving around near each other slowly, the third was to the left, sitting still.  All three stayed stationary, not drifting with the wind.   A fourth light appeared in between the first three, moving fast from East to West, and disappeared after it passed by the others.  The remaining three lights began to go dim until after about thirty seconds were not visible.  Moments later a plane or jet came from the South West and flew directly to the same area.;40.9685951219512;-117.750834146341
