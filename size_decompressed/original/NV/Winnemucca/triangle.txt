We were sitting in my hot tub last night. I leaned back to look at the stars as it was a very clear night and the stars very bright. I viewed a very large V moving overhead from NE toward SW. I said what the heck is that everyone looked up and briefly saw what I was looking at. At first I thought it was a large flock of Geese, but the formation was too purfect and much straighter that a V of geese. It appeared to be a formation of smaller odjects because it was not a solid V I could see the stars behind the center of the V. Each individual object was a small square and appeared to be lit up. The color was soft orange like a harvest moon color. The squares on one side of the V looked a little more ragged than the other side. The whole grouping moved steady but quickly across the sky. We may have had a view for 6-8 seconds and it was gone out of sight behind trees in our neighbors yard. There was no sound at all. All of us saw the object(s) the same as we discussed it after it was gone, and all had a very strange feeling that it was like nothing any of us had ever seen.;40.9685951219512;-117.750834146341
