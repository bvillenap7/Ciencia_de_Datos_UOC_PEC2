Large golden-orange fireball appears by airplane.;2013-03-05 21:33:00;2 minutes;Large golden-orange fireball appears by airplane March 5, 2013 9:33 p.m. My girlfriend and I were sitting on our back deck looking toward the Mesa westerly star gazing, when the gold-orange object looking like fire popped up from absolutely nowhere right before our eyes. After hovering for about 10 seconds, it vanished.  After 1-2 seconds, it popped back on. Then after being on for a few more seconds, it vanished again.  In a short period of time, this ball of fire popped on yet again, however this time it became visible and was in very close proximity to a plane that was flying in an easterly direction. The ball of fire was approximately four times bigger than the plane so it is very doubtful that the pilot could have missed it. The object vanished and did not come back after that.  At no time did we see this object flying in any direction, it was always stationary. This is not the first time we have seen these fireballs.;36.811485;-114.111385
