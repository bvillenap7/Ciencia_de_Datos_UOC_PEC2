Bright flashes from a streaking object light up the sky and leave a large smoke trail over Mesquite, Nevada.;2004-06-19 04:30:00;5 seconds;Bright flashes from a streaking object light up the sky and leave a large smoke trail over Mesquite, Nevada. At 4:30AM a series of bright flashes from a streaking object lit up the early dawn sky.  The object appeared to cover 30 to 50 miles in about 5 seconds, traveling from East to West.  Four or five flashes lit the entire area like large lighting strikes do and appeared to me to look like magnesium when it burns.  My first, split second  reaction was that it was a large meteor burning up in the atmosphere, but the flashes were too bright.  It totally vanished after the last flash.  A large trail of smoke was left in the sky from a point where the first flash occured to the last.  I am a pilot and I would estimate the smoke trail to be at about 15,000 feet above ground level.  The smoke trail spread and dissipated like a normal condensation trail of a jet aircraft.  There was absolutely no sound from the object.;36.811485;-114.111385
Very loud sounded like Jets very low over the house, stayed there long enough for me to just look at them,;2015-09-16 18:30:00;5 minutes;Very loud sounded like Jets very low over the house, stayed there long enough for me to just look at them, Just about sunset, very loud sounded like Jets over the house.  They went over I listened it took a few seconds still listening.  Then it was quiet for a few minutes then they came back. I went out in the back yard so I could quickly see the sky.  I figured it was probably too late to see anything, I was only hearing it at a distance now and couldn't see anything.  Then they came back just enough dark and really high enough that all I could see was bright lights 2 with red flashes.  I was staring trying to figure out what I was looking at when I realized they weren't really moving anymore, because I was actually just staring at them above the neighbors house now but very high.  It lasted for at least a few minutes then they left.  I looked around trying to figure out why no one else was out looking too*  We have a lot of windows maybe that was why I could hear it so loud, don't know.  I was thinking they flew out of the West to toward the east but when I heard it again had circled back and when it left it was to the east.;36.811485;-114.111385
