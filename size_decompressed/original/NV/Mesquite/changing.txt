We stopped to watch it and as we did it appeard to be black and change shapes.  It also appeared as though from time to time some thing or some things fell from it to Earth.  It when below the cloud cover appeared to be black in color.  It moved up and down and from side to side.  It appeard as though the whole thing came down to Earth somewhere in the Desert outside of Mesquite Nevada.  I don't have a clue what it was, and wondering if anybody else happend to see what we all got to observe.  Bill Bartko Beaver Dam Az. bartko@cascadeaccess.com;36.811485;-114.111385
