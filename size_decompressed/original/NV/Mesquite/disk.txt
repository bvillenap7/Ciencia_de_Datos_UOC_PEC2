Large gray domed disc that was perfectly still and made no noise 2460 feet away and 500 feet high.;2008-06-17 12:00:00;4 Min;Large gray domed disc that was perfectly still and made no noise 2460 feet away and 500 feet high. On or about June 17th, 2008 I was driving home at about 12:00 hours. I made a right hand turn onto Marilyn Parkway (east)from Kitty Hawk. I was in front of Marilyn Redd Park when I looked to the north and saw a gray disc shaped craft hovering about five hundred feet in the air. It was perfectly still and made no noise what so ever. It was hovering just to the east of the Mesquite air port and remained in place for about two minutes. It then departed to the north and within one to two minutes was completely out of sight. It was the most incredible thing that I have ever seen. According to a map, it was about 2460 feet away. From my point of vision it was about two inches long and one-half inch high. There is no way in this world that I could have mistaken it for any thing else. The color was gray and reminded me of the color of a side walk. Note: I returned to the location and took a photo of the location and direction of the craft. I have superimposed a disc and it is exactly what I witnessed.
