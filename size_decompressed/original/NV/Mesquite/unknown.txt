Driving home from dinner, we noticed a red light in the southern sky.  Suddenly, two more joined it.   The red lights were flying in a line formation.  One seemed to soar high and then came lower the second two disappeared.  The third one was heading NW towards our direction.   I really tried to get photos the whole time but my cell phone camera would not work. It was like it was frozen.   The third red light disappeared when we looked down for one second.  We have never encountered anything like this.   They were very quiet so we do not think it was anything for Nellis.

Star-like object moving in strange patterns in the eastern sky.;2020-05-06 03:00:00;2 hours;Star-like object moving in strange patterns in the eastern sky. I went out to smoke at 3am and just happened to see what looked like a star moving around in the sky. It moved in strange patterns i.e. zig-zags, tight cirles, pendulum swings.	  I then called two friends who were awake to come outside and look at it, they also saw it. It lasted in the sky until there was enough light that the stars disapeared.
