2 oval shaped craft,  flying from north to south at approx. 10,000ft.;2012-05-27 10:15:00;10-15 sec.;2 oval shaped craft,  flying from north to south at approx. 10,000ft. I looked up at the clouds and saw 2 craft, one appearing to slowley pass the other.   At first I thought them to be birds, flying extremely high, but when they flew over the cloud it was obvious they were not birds.  I watched intently to see what would pass on the other side of the cloud and nothing appeared.  The cloud was approx. 10,000 ft.  There was no noise, moments later a commercial aircraft came from a different direction with its telltale vapor trails and wings quite visible. These other craft had no vapor trails, no wings and there was no noise.;39.3806;-119.2757
