Bright yellow round object with orange and purple tail seen over North Lake Tahoe.object.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.  PD));2016-07-27 21:35:00;2 minutes;Bright yellow round object with orange and purple tail seen over North Lake Tahoe. I was driving down Mt Rose Hwy, and saw what I thought to be a helicopter with a search light through the pine trees.  I rolled down the window to the vehicle, and didn't hear the typical helicopter noise.  The US Coast Guard has a station here, and I've seen and heard their helicopters many times, and quickly dismissed this as a one.   I came to a clearing in the trees, and got a closer look at the object. It was coming from the west over Crystal Bay on the north shore of Lake Tahoe.   It was round in shape, yellow/orange in color, with a long orange and purple fiery looking tail. It made no noise.  For a moment it almost looked like two separate objects.  It was moving slower than any aircraft that I've seen, and was heading southeast in what appeared to be a downward motion.  It then disappeared into the forest. ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.
