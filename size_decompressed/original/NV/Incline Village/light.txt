Bright multicolored light.   ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the star, Sirius??  PD));2008-04-02 22:45:00;23:15;Bright multicolored light What at first appeared to be a VERY bright star to the West of Incline Village, approximately over Kings Beach area.  Just above the tree line.  The light alternated in color between white, red, blue, and green as if a light was shining through a prism. When viewed through binoculars the formation of the light was changing and at times took on a triangular shape with a line of each color (red, blue, and green) making up each side of the triangle. The light remained stationary in the sky and very bright for about 20 minutes then dimmed and became much lower in the sky (even with an electrical pole from the second story porch) for about ten minutes before it was no longer visible. The rate of descent was much greater than the movement of the stars in the sky which remained more or less stationary in relation to us and the light during the time the light changed positions. However, the rate of movement was not significant enough that you could really tell it was moving if you were not already watching it.  We thought it was Venus or Mars at first but this light was much too bright to be either planet. It also seemed to have an aura and extending rays in variations of the contingent colors at times. The closest analog I can think of is the glint of a prism. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of the star, Sirius??  PD));39.2564333333333;-119.95155
