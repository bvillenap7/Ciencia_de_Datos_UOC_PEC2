An airplane was heard, I looked up and saw what looked to be a star or bright light (approx. like Venus) at 45 degrees high in the sky due East.  The airplane passed, the star continued to shine and move approx. 15 degrees North in the sky from original sighting location.  The Star changed colors to red and rainbow colors and appeared to spin.  The color changed  back to white and red/rainbow colors several times.  At times, light appeared to change shape, like a disc moving about.  After approx. 5 mins, the light disappeared behind a cloud.  There was no contrail or smoke trail, as you would expect from a missile/aircraft test.  Please let me know if there were any other reports or miliary tests in the area.

Object  over Lake Tahoe.;2014-09-12 06:00:00;3 minutes;Object  over Lake Tahoe. Before dawn on Friday September 12th, I noticed a small red dot in the sky over Lake Tahoe. I was a passenger in a work truck.  I commented to my friend and asked if he could see it.  The red seemed to change slightly and then it turned white and  changed shape into more of a comet with a short tail, all bright white.   At this point my friend saw it too.  The object seemed to grow much larger then and resembled a bright spot light shining into a smoke like vapor, like a v shape trailing behind the light.  The light seemed to steer towards the south and west from my position on the north shore.  The vapor seemed to expand and lighten and the light then vanished completely.   Not sure what it was but I will be looking up more from now on!;39.2564333333333;-119.95155
