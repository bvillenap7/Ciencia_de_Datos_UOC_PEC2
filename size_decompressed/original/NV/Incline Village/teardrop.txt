High altitude, highly reflective object over Lake Tahoe, Nevada.;2014-05-24 13:30:00;~2 hours;High altitude, highly reflective object over Lake Tahoe, Nevada. My wife and I observed the object just south of directly, overhead Burnt Cedar Beach in Incline Village, Nevada, at approximately 80 degrees.  It seemed to be highly reflective and was easily visible though seemed to be quite high.  It was very small and since it seemed to be holding its position it was not generating much attention despite the large number of people on the beach.  I watched the object, slightly above and to the left of the crescent moon for over 2 hours.  The object was still there when I left. I have done some research and found that Google was doing some balloon work in the area and may be an explanation for what I saw. Please refer to the web site please pardon the name of the site I mean no offense. http://www.google.com/loon/ ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone on two occasions with the witness, and he seemed to us to be exceptionally eloquent and serious-minded.  He has extensive experience in the aviation industry.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD));39.2564333333333;-119.95155
