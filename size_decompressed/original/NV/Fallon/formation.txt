Four lights forming a parallel line transformed into a triangle, and then blinked out.;2015-02-23 18:05:00;15 seconds;Four lights forming a parallel line transformed into a triangle, and then blinked out. Driving North on Lovelock Highway near Coleman Rd, I noticed 4 lights in a parallel line which seemed to be coming toward me from the North-Northeast.  They appeared to be near the Fallon Airport and I initially supposed them to be one of the large Navy jets heading toward the base.   As they continued to approach, I could see that there was no body to the aircraft, but four separate lights which then changed from a parallel line to a triangle, with the 2nd light from the left forming the apex.   After about 5 seconds, the lights simultaneously blinked out.  I was unable to see any other sign of them.   When I made it home a few minutes later, only the brightest starts and Venus were visible in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
