The duration has increased from one hour to two and three hours.  Last week they stayed till almost daylight which was quite unusual.  They come up off the desert floor and seperate.  They were farther in the distance before but the longer I observe the closer they appear to come.  Small craft comes off larger craft for longer periods of time.  The smaller craft (or circles) stay and bounce off the desert floor then return to the larger sphere.  The sphere has changed color on occasion from just white with red rimmed lights to a green white glow that changes shape. It looks as if the crafts change from one night to the next.  Both my husband and I watched for over two hours the other night between 3 and 5 AM.  After several unexplainable hours they reunited and went straight up into the sky.  We watched them with bincolurs for most of the time from our bedroom window.;39.4692;-118.7864
