Space junk triangle traveling from West to East over Fallon, NV?;2003-07-05 23:15:00;5 minutes;Space junk triangle traveling from West to East over Fallon, NV? This is probably a space junk report.  While visiting Fallon, NV a small group had been looking for satellites and had seen a couple earlier in the evening.  At 23:15 on July 5, 2003 four observers noted three faint white lights towards the North traveling from West to East in a triangle formation.  The point of the isoceles triangle was in the lead and the two remaining lights, making up the base, were evenly spaced and followed the first point of light. They were closely spaced and traveling at the same speed.  The speed was similar to the speed of other satellites we had observed.  With arm extended they were less than a half of a thumb in seperation.  When they were about 30 degrees East (0 degrees being directly above) the white lights faded out together.  I checked the Heavens Above web site and did not find anything listed for 23:15 - 23:20 that was even close to what was observed.  Based on the time of night the objects had to be at least 400 miles above ground elevation.;39.4692;-118.7864
Pinpoint of light, surrounded by sphere of growing white mist, just below Jupiter.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile fuel dump??  PD));2015-03-12 21:16:00;4 minutes;Pinpoint of light surrounded by sphere of growing white mist just below Jupiter moving west to east seen in northern Nevada.  A pinpoint of light just below canis minor was slowly engulfed by a small white blurry puff.  I pointed it out to my husband.  We watched the object move in an accelerating straight line towards Regulus, just under Jupiter.  As it moved steadily across the sky, the puff of whitish mist around it steadily grew in circumference.  A tiny pinpoint of light could always be seen at the center of the growing puff.  The object moved steadily across the sky toward Regulus (I whipped out my star tracker app to track it), it suddenly slowed and came to a stop just under Jupiter.  The puff continued to increase in circumference and dissipate.  The object then began to move slowly again towards Regulus.  As it approached Regulus it again slowed, stopped.  The tiny pinpoint of light could still be seen, the white puff around the object had now grown in size to such a circumference it could barely be seen.  The light then disappeard as the puff of white completely dissipated. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the sighting is due to a fuel dump from an expended Centaur stage of an Atlas V missile launch.  We express our gratitude to Mr. Ted Molczan for the heads up on this incident.  We copy below his e-mail of March 13, 2015, about the incident.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM MR. TED MOLCZAN, OF SEESAT-L)) Hello Peter, The fuel dump from the Centaur stage of last night's Atlas V launch, was widely visible to the unaided eye from N. America. It began on Mar 13 at about 04:15 UTC, and was visible for about an hour. Ed Cannon, a long-time member of SeeSat-L, described his sighting as follows: http://satobs.org/seesat/Mar-2015/0143.html The Centaur was on a high-elevation pass, that moved west to east across the southern sky. It climbed in altitude from about 2,500 km to more than 20,000 km, on its way to its apogee of about 70,000 km. Best regards, Ted Molczan ((END ADDENDUM));39.4692;-118.7864
