Fallon Triangle seen by Ufo Television Talk Show Host;2002-09-08 23:13:00;10 seconds;Fallon Triangle seen by Ufo Television Talk Show Host Sept. 8 2002 11:13 pm While outside having a smoke I was looking north of 1880 Auction Rd when I saw a dark shadow of substance dimly lit hugh craft fly by at about 1000 feet. This craft traveled west down Williams Ave with no running lights  but dimmly lit light nodes were seen but they were Not Lit. The nodes were in the shape of the whole craft, triangle. Estimate amount of speed I would say 20 mph or faster. No noise was associated with the craft. I was completely surprised of this event and said why me. I have hosted a Ufo Television talk show for ten years of which Mr. Davenport has been a guest many times. I believe this was the true and real triangle craft. It was so completely unexpected yet there it was so close and so huge. I did not see a leading edge or rear of craft I just saw a triangle from the side and bottom of the ship. The sky was clear and about 70 degrees.;39.4692;-118.7864
Small, triangular-shaped craft flying westerly, late Sunday evening of Memorial Day Weekend 2016;2016-05-29 23:59:00;2 minutes;Small, triangular-shaped craft flying westerly, late Sunday evening of Memorial Day Weekend 2016 I observed a small, triangular-shaped craft in the sky above the City of Fallon, NV, on late Sunday evening of Memorial Day Weekend 2016.  Upon exiting my vehicle in front of my apartment, I looked up at the sky to admire the stars as it was a fairly clear night.  Fallon has a fair amount of light pollution making it difficult to see a lot of stars.  I looked at a patch of clouds in the eastern sky and observed a pale glow reflecting off of the clouds and some type of aircraft coming through the patch, heading toward the west.  It was flying in a straight path at a relatively fast pace, but not unlike a jet airplane flying at a low altitude.  It appeared to be small and triangular, blackish in color, with a pale light on each point.  But its size is relative to its altitude so I am not completely sure how small or large it was.  It may have been flying at 5-10,000 feet relative to the eastern patch of clouds.  I noticed how it covered the stars as it passed ! above, which made it easy to track its  flight path in the sky.  I only observed the craft for approximately two minutes or less and it was out of my line of sight quickly.  I was standing 20 feet from my one-story apartment door which impaired my sight to the west.  I doubt I would have observed much even if I went to my backyard as there are trees and other houses on the other side of the street that would have also impaired my sight.  I entered my apartment shortly after that and did not observe anything else.;39.4692;-118.7864
