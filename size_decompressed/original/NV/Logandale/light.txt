I went to look back at the images and seen a light, diffintly moving, several different colors.  I captured three photos of the light, I didn't see any noticeable object, but it descended and then changed course then disappeared, I seen this light for six nights following the photos and my dog was somehow affected. normally a gentle loving dog, after that night became aggressive.;36.5911;-114.4738
