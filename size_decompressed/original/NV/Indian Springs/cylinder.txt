UFO Sighting Indian Springs NV, off Highway US 95;2009-08-05 08:37:00;10 min;UFO Sighting Indian Springs NV, off Highway US 95 Driving Down US 95 just outside of Indian Springs, NV, 3 small red lights in the shape of a triangle rose at about 45 degrees off the ground - i though it was a fire work so i watched it for a moment, then noticed a small blueish white light following close behind it like a tail. When the object reached its desired altitude it froze as the blue light caught up to it and leveled off, then both lights turned bright white and began twinkling at each other in increments of 3 flashes per side. It was about 700ft above the ground and about 1 mile away from my car. Then the object flew off south bound down the highway and into the distance, quite quickly. I continued south down US 95 and pulled over for some gas, after a quick fill up continued back on the highway and saw the object again still twinkling its white lights. it had flown about 4 miles from the sight i saw it rise so i concluded it could not be a toy plane or helicopter ,especially going as fast as it ! was and as far from its point of origin. The object zipped along the highway faster than i was driving (about 90mph) giving me ample time to observe it. With out notice the object turned around and began to head north up the highway. At this point i realized that the object was not 2 individual lights but a tube like object with lights on either side. I watched the lights turn from white to blue then back to red. Once the objects lights were all red it stopped and hovered in the air it remained still in the air as i drove past it, i could faintly make out the body at this point but not clear enough to see any defining features except for the shape and the three red lights on the side facing my car. I am a Grad Student at UNLV and am not prone to seeing funny objects in the sky - I'm certain this was nothing i had ever seen before.;36.5686;-115.6767
