Once in Vegas saw two smaller rounded t First craft was a light traveling east from Indian Springs towards Las Vegas on the south side of the 95 south over mountains.  Traveling slow and high, light seemed to change colors and get brighter at times.  Military fighter gets in pairs would approach from  opposite sides and cross right by craft as if they were investigating.  Those would leave and 2 more would fly by to also investigate.  Followed all the way along the 95 to Vegas where is flew out over and past the strip, there were also other floating crafts/lights in sky above vegas.   Then we saw 2 small triangle shaped with  rounded edges flying one behind the other traveling very fast with yellow green and orange colored lights one color to each corner of craft.   Also craft was flashing  read it three times, then white three times.  Crafts flew almost straight up then leveled out and turned and disappeared out of view.   Saul crafts again 10 minutes later traveling much slower and only flashing white with no red  and flashing at much slower intervals.;36.5686;-115.6767
