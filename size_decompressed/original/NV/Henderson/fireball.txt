Bright Green Fireball in night sky travelling west-east over Henderson NV  Food for Less parking lot 9-24-10;2010-09-24 19:30:00;.5 second;Bright Green Fireball in night sky travelling west-east over Henderson NV  Food for Less parking lot 9-24-10 I was exiting a food store at Warm Springs and Sunset Rd. on the south-west corner.  I looked up because something in the periphery of my vision appeared.  I saw an intense green fireball traveling west to east at a very high rate of speed.  I could not guess the altitude it was about the size of my small fingernail.  It appeared like it came over some houses to the west and then into the vicinity of the parking lot, where it blinked out, just before it disappeared a bright orange spark came shooting off of it.  There appeared to be a hazy orange aura surrounding the fireball, which was in the shape of a square more than a ball. There was a small trail of the green material following it that disappeared when the object blinked out. There was no sound, no smoke given off, no evidence after it disappeared.  There were no aircraft in the area at all.  I could not guess at the speed, it travelled over the length of the parking lot in less than half a second.  It did not appear to change direction.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382

My family and i were standing on our third floor balcony ready to watch the fireworks.  Approximately at 11:58 pm we witnesses a strange bright cube shape slowly hovering with a centre of fire in the air.  We were facing east and the flaming cube with four points was approximately half the size of a full moon.   After just being there for about a minute it simply just faded to black.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382

Very Strange Red Sphere Over Henderson, Nevada.;2014-05-03 22:02:00;20 seconds;Very Strange Red Sphere Over Henderson, Nevada. While sitting in the backyard of my home on May 3, 2014 at 10:00 pm, I observed a bright red ball travel over the Las Vegas Valley area that was very odd.  I have been watching the sky's for some time hoping to see something unexplained like this. After watching aircraft come and go from this busy region, this object stood out because it was a solid red light that never blinked.  No other lights were on the craft.  This object flew a straight path from southwest to northwest, leaving sight after 10 to 15 seconds. I was prepared with a new pair of 7x35 binoculars and was able to view the craft well.  The object was bright red and had a halo effect around it, however this may have been an anomaly because it seemed to be ascending slightly as it traveled northeast out of the valley through a low thin cloud cover. The altitude of this craft appeared to be  2000 to 3000 feet.  It made no sound and appeared that the red glow was at the rear of the object and it would shift and from side to side.   Every craft I see here has solid lights and blinking lights.  I can see in great detail with binoculars even at night.  It left no exhaust trail and was certainly something very different than aircraft.  No wing outlines and it resembled a spherical shape of glowing bright red. Though the craft flew straight, suggesting a fast moving plane, it's behavior was not of any plane I have watched.  A rocket, weather balloon, meteor or helicopter would not act like this object. I was happy to finally see something unexplained in our sky's after months of trying.   We live near Area 51 and a large airforce base.  I suspect they had something to do with the object, which was very unusual. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD));36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Two orangish glowing orbs silent, extreme acceleration and speed.;2016-01-24 19:45:00;2-3 minutes;Two orangish glowing orbs silent, extreme acceleration and speed. While out for an evening walk with my wife son and dog,  My son noticed a glowing orangish light in the sky in front of us and called it a glowing pumpkin, as we were watching it another u.f.o. approached at such velocity, if you blinked you might think it just appeared or turned the lights on.   They hovered a minute or so then the second to arrive sped off right towards Boulder City with acceleration and speed not capable by humans.  The crafts were silent and the first to arrive was last to go and this time I didn't see the tracer across the sky as it left.  It was either too fast or maybe it went a different direction like straight up.  Either way, this was the strangest thing I have ever seen in the night sky in my lifetime.  I truly feel like there is technology out there that must make ours look like childplay.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382

When I did I saw 4 firey objects moving in a circular motion, and then started to move in very peculiar motions as if it was a fly.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
