Large light in southern Nevada for over an hour.;2001-05-24 04:45:00;1 hour;Large light in southern Nevada for over an hour. I witnessed a very large light hovering above black mountain in Henderson ,NV for over an hour. It was brighter and much larger than Venus, which I could plainly see to the left. At the time of the sighting I was in my car listening to a local talk radio show and someone called confirming what I was looking at. The last time I could see the object It had gained altitude greatly, this was about 6am. Many people had to of seen this due to the duration of the sighting and the population density in the area.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382

Then the light turned into an object in the sky that resembled two square boxes, intersecting each other, with lights surrounding the boxes.  The object began to move to the east.  As it moved, it turned back into the bright light, like I first saw the the beginning of the sighting, and then it made a loud rumbling noise, similar to that of an airplane.  It drifted off toward the east until I could see it no longer.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Two pulsating blue objects stayed motionless near Black Mountain.;2003-06-05 22:00:00;20 min.;Two pulsating blue objects stayed motionless near Black Mountain. Two objects stayed motionless off the east side of Black Mountain, over looking Las Vegas for about 20 minutes. They were emitting a bright, very intense, blue light. A white pulsating light was on top and would pulse on for about 5 seconds then fadeout. I called the Henderson PD, but by the time they got here, the objects were gone.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382

The night was dark, the moon was just over the west mountains and was only giving off a little light because it was just a sliver.  I looked up and there was a black wing directly over head moving at what seemed to be maybe 50-60 miles per hour.  I could see the whole shape of the wing as it passed over.  It was headed west.  It seemed small, maybe the size of a small airplane and it seemed low maybe 200 or 300 feet above the homes.  My first impression was it was a hang glider.  The wing had no lights and made no sound.  I was only able to watch it for 3 or 4 seconds as it moved away from me I saw the back of the craft and then it simply blended into the night.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Very fast half moon craft.;2007-09-26 04:00:00;10 Seconds;Very fast half moon craft. A rather large, almost half moon shape UFO came into sight from the east, past my entire horizon, and went out of view to the west in approximately 10 seconds.  There were no lights and no sound, the only way it was visible was from the city lights it reflected as it passed, and as it blocked out the stars.  I would guess the object was about 2500-5000 feet up, moved in a straight line, and as I have a full view of the mountains to the south of Las Vegas, and it passed so quickly, I would guess it had to have been going about 500-1000 miles per hour to pass east to west so quickly.      I am a corporate trainer, 29 male, homeowner, and this is the first UFO I have ever seen.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Bright blob over henderson NV;2008-10-06 20:00:00;1 minute;Bright blob over henderson NV My friend and I went for a short walk during a break at work. To the east we noticed a bright blob of light that was rapidly changing colors. Brighter then any airplane light I have seen. We continued to watch it for approx a minute or so, at one point the light went dim and had very rapidly blinking lights of all colors, it then got bright again and then simply vanished. Also during all this there were planes in the area lining up for McCarran airport, this was nowhere near the line. I also was able to get a short video of the object. It was not great quality.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Large Red Balloon over Las Vegas;2009-07-14 09:15:00;20 Minutes;Large Red Balloon over Las Vegas Large Red Ballon with two smaller White Balloons attached on each side. Moved from north east toward south west. Crossed under the morning moon on its way southwest. Must have gone higher and changed direction back toward the North East. This was a large object and it got smaller as it went higher. It was larger than some of the planes in the sky at about the same altitude.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
UFO Report:  Date: October 11th, 2011 Location: Las Vegas, NV (near Henderson, NV) Time: 8:40 A.M.;2011-10-11 08:40:00;3 minutes;UFO Report:   Date: October 11th, 2011  Location:  Las Vegas, NV (near Henderson, NV)  Time: 8:40 A.M. Near Las Vegas Nevada, I was outside on my patio talking on my cell phone.  As I was on my patio I witnessed what seemed to be a fairly large object at high altitude hovering for more than 3 minutes.   As I am a pilot, I do not take this lightly.  My best guess altitude would be 50,000’ then directly up to an unknown altitude out of sight.   The object appeared to be two small spheres or discs that were connected by a straight bridge.  I am convinced that this was not a weather balloon because it was too large, and not of the shape.  I am also convinced that this was not a satellite as there was no horizontal movement for the period, until the object moved out of sight.  I am writing this report now certain that ufo’s do exist.   The quick movement of the object was by no means made of current technology that we have at hand.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382

My husband and I got home like 11pm at night, I stayed to look at the bright moon, while my husband went to our condo, it was beautiful moon, but then I noticed a soft white light circle orb flying in circular motion away from the moon, in and out of clouds, going up and down, and I know for a fact where we face away from the strip of Las Vegas, Nevada, and I know it wasn't a normal light, I have ever since. I Know for a fact it was an ORB,  I video record it a little caption maybe like 5 seconds or less video, of the ORB and took one decent picture of the ORB..;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
