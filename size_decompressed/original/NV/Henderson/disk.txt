Three stationary saucer shaped objects over Sunrise Mountain, east side of Las Vegas, NV, August 2005.;2005-08-25 18:00:00;5 minutes;Three stationary saucer shaped objects over Sunrise Mountain, east side of Las Vegas, NV, August 2005. Towards the end of August, 2005, I went out in my backyard to look at the thunder clouds about 5PM.  My backyard was high, faced east and had an unobstructed 180 degree view being forty feet higher than the rooftops to the east.  Thunder storms were developing and cumulous clouds were building.  As I enjoyed the view, I noticed a dark spot in the sky over the south end of Sunrise Mountain to the NE of Henderson.  Facing east, the object appeared to be at 11 o’clock.  It was against blue sky in a large break between the clouds and it was stationary.  It was roughly above the flight path along Charleston Street that helicopters use for McCarran Airport.  They travel a a couple thousand feet.  This was much higher than that.  To the naked eye it appeared to be large and round.  My first thought was that it might be a helium balloon, but logic told me it was in the wrong place for that, the wrong time of day, and the wrong sort of weather.  The south end of Sunrise Mountain is about five or six miles from my house.  I estimated the altitude of the thing to about 10,000 feet more or less.  I stepped into the house and retrieved binoculars.  The object had not moved.  When I focused on the object I saw it was actually three round shapes fairly close together.  A large round plate was partially hiding another slightly smaller plate behind it at about one o’clock to the first, and a third round plate, appearing smaller yet, at about 2 o’clock to the biggest one.  The relative sizes gave the impression of three objects each at a slightly increasing distances and slightly different altitudes.  They appeared to be dull metallic silver. There were no lights on the objects.  I watched for about a minute, maybe less, and then, through the binoculars I saw all three objects “keel over” in unison by about 90 degrees at which point they appeared thin and flat.  I called my wife and son and, with a second pair of binoculars, tried to help them spot the objects.  However, they wear glasses, are not used to spotting small objects, etc and they never saw them.  In between trying to help my family to see them too, I watched for another couple of minutes.  Finally, the clouds intervened and hid whatever they were from further view.  My house was about as half mile South of the flight path into McCarran Airport. Commercial aircraft continued to land during this time, basically following Sunset Rd into the airport with landing lights on below about three thousand feet.  They and are a common sight.  This was not a helicopter or an airplane or a harrier jump jet, etc.  All three objects were clearly visible and I have no explanation for what they could have been.

Three bright lights above Seven Hills that are non moving.;2009-07-20 10:00:00;still continuing;Three bright lights above Seven Hills that are non moving. When I went outside and looked up in the sky in a southern direction there was one really bright light and when I took out my telescope I carefully looked at it. It was not moving just hovering there. So when I went to film it with my camera in the video on the screen there was three big bright lights that were not moving. But without the camera there’s only one light. I photographed the sighting with a video camera.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
