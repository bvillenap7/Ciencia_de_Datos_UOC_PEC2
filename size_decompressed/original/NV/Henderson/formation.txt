(2) extremely large, dark craft, in formation operating  at a very slow speed in total silence, overhead.;1997-03-13 21:00:00;3 minutes;(2) extremely large, dark craft, in formation operating  at a very slow speed in total silence, overhead. at approximately 2100 hours, I was soaking in my backyard spa, looking up directly overhead, moving from east to west, I viewed what appeared to be two craft, in formation, similar to what aircraft fly during refueling operations.  The craft displayed no visible lights, but were lit by background light from the city of Las Vegas.  The speed at which they operated seemed extremely slow by comparison to normal aircraft that I am familiar with, being an airline pilot. And there was complete silence.  Thier size was larger than any aircraft I had ever seen, appeared to be flying wings or triangles.  I would judge the altitude to be approximately seven to ten thousand feet.  I was so struck by the sight of this experience, I remained motionless and made no attempt to obtain binoculars or cameras.  Again, thier size was incredible as was thier total silence and lack of speed as they flew overhead.  I first thought that it was some refueling operation, but they were within just several miles of McCarran airport, in the airports controlled airspace.  The craft appeared to be black in color, and reflected just enough light that I could make out thier outlines.  The two craft continued in the formation described, to the west and then blended into the night.  No lights were observed, no sound what so ever, however, not trying to be dramatic, I felt thier presence, that is the reason I loked up.  At the time I was employed by Continental Airlines, and elected not to mention this experience to  anyone.  I am now retired, and I saw a piece on cable that referred to the Phoenix lights. I thought I would share this with others.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
