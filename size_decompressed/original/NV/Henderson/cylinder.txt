The craft was cylindrical with a domed top. On the botton was a row of reddish pulsating ligths in a t-shaped formation. The carfat wobbled and danced  and moved horizontally for several miles. It had red running lights on its bottom. The lights pulsated and finally flickered and blew up into a cascade of red glowing debris. The debris fell like a cascade from the craft for a few seconds, then the craft dimmed and blinked out. Aweek later at exactly the saqme time a red glowing orb appeared,it exploded after a few minutes of observation with my 80 mm binocs, then I saw  triangular craft leaving the scene and it faded to nothing in 30 seconds. I have the feeling I was not supposed ot see this phenomena..but I feel it is my duty to report such high strangeness.  ((name deleted));36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Cylindrical luminescent craft seen hovering over Henderson, Nevada  January 08, 5:15 AM;2004-01-08 05:00:00;12 minutes;Cylindrical luminescent craft seen hovering over Henderson, Nevada  January 08, 5:15 AM I let out my dog at 5:15 AM and I also went out into the backyard to look at the stars in the early morning pre-dawn sky. I noticed a large,bright red orange glowing light directly overhead. It was moving west to east slowly. I quickly grabbed my astronomical 11x80 binocs and focused on the object. It was a glowing yellow cylindrical craft, slightly domed on top. The bottom of the craft was flat and was a mass of glowing orange red rockets of an energy source, it pulsated and grew in intensity as they craft moved. The craft wobbled perceptibly and took a horizontal trajectory, all the while the craft itself was a vertical cylinder, three times longer than wide. The craftmoved to the east for several miles at high altitude then turned to the south and proceeded for several miles. It began to drop glowing reddish debris from the rockets or energy source. This behavior continued for several minutes until the craft began to accelerate and it rose in elevation. Suddenly the craft blinked out and the glowing embers stopped. Last january 14 I witnessed exactly the same thing from my house, but at 7PM. That occurence lasted 10 minutes. My wife winessed the craft both times, so I have a good witness. We are mystified.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
