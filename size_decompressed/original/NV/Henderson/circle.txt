ROYAL BLUE BALL WITH SMALL ORANGE BALLS WITH THICK  RED FIRE STREAK;2004-06-19 04:52:00;20 seconds;ROYAL BLUE BALL WITH SMALL ORANGE BALLS WITH THICK  RED FIRE STREAK I have delivered newspapers in the same area for seven years.My husband always goes with me. I have seen what you call falling star's, but never anything like this. I was half way through my route and was making a u-turn when a bright light in the sky cought my eye.I stopped and said, what is that-look! I knew that it was 4:52 am because i had just looked at the time before as i always do. I check the time at that spot to see how soon we will be done.We saw a royal blue round ball going very fast with a long streak of red fire streaking from it in the sky.It looked like the size of a soccur ball from where we were at.The streak of fire behind it was very long and was as thick as the blue ball.There was smaller orange balls coming off the blue ball before dissapearing very fast.There was a trail of grey white smoke like big puffy clouds for a long time after it dissapeared. I have seen jet's leave streaks in the sky, but nothing like this. The first thing i thought of was an airplane on fire, but nothing fell from the sky, it just dissapeared. This left me shaking for quite a few minutes. it really frightened me. My husband said it was in the direction of Utah. When we got home we called KLAS TV Channel 8. We told them what we saw. They said there was a lot of people calling in that had seen the same thing.They said they called the Airforce and Law Enforcement, but they did'nt have any answers to what it was. The TV station said they would have an update on the 5pm news.When we watched the news that night, they said they had no answers to what everyone saw. If anyone has any answers to what it was, i would appreciate hearing about it.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
White, round light with white tail moving quickly, but sporadically.;2008-04-05 04:20:00;ongoing;White, round light with white tail moving quickly, but sporadically. Approximately 4:20 AM, I was in front of my house having a non-sleeping smoke.  A light caught my eye in the sky and it was much closer than a star.  More like an airplane traveling over the city at highest altitude.  Upon observing it, I noticed that this solid, white light was moving forward quickly, but in jerking motions forward, then one side to the other, then every now and then it would move backward, only to go forward again.  At times, it would stop completely, then move in tiny circular motions.  It was stationary for approximately 5 minutes, then moved forward and then backward.  My house faces due west and it was traveling from the west to the east.  As it came more overhead, at this time about a 90 degree angle, I began noticing a straight line extending from the white, round base that was also a solid white.  I called Nellis Air Force Base and they gave me your phone number.  I have left a message for you on the phone number that the Air Force Base gave me.  Before signing off, I just went out to check it again.  It is still in one place, but bouncing around in an almost jerky, circular pattern.  I can still see the line of white protruding from the circular base.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Large white and green synchronized wheel in the sky.;2008-08-24 02:30:00;90 minutes;Large white and green synchronized wheel in the sky. This happened at the end of August, I think the year was maybe 2008.  We just had a severe summer storm so there was moving clouds in the sky.  My sister couldn’t sleep so she was out looking outside the window and she woke me up to look at something weird in the sky.  Looking out from our den window we saw a large moving wheel in the sky with spokes that turned counter clock-wise.  I think it was green and white colors.  Flashes of light would emanate from the wheel every few seconds.  This lasted from about 2:30 am to 4:00 am. We have tried many on-line searches to find out if anyone else saw this but no one seems to.  Considering the size of the object and just the fact that it was so incredible to see, I cannot image no one else seeing it that night.  There was no mention of it in our local newspaper, TV news and our co-workers didn’t see it either.  Last June we attended a Coast To Coast radio event and were fortunate to ask George Noory and George Knapp about this, but the were unsure also. At the risk of sounding foolish, the image of the wheel and its movement almost appeared to resemble a synchronized dance routine.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382

Round object, metallic, It reflected the sunlight.;2014-05-26 17:30:00;45 minutes;Round object, metallic, It reflected the sunlight Me and my wife were cloud watching when I noticed what looked to be a star.   We broke out the binoculars and could see round object, metallic, day time.  Thought it was a star,  at first it did not seam to be moving.   It appeared from a cloud and look to be still then move over to another cloud to the north.  It did not move fast at first but very slowly move north, stopping then instead of drifting west like a stare or planet would have it moved very fast east.  Stopping again by another cloud, then further east out of sight, taking between 45 min and an hour.   It was not a plane, no vapor trail and there was airplanes all over the place and it was not a bird could see the birds, and could make them out.   It reflected the sunlight, shiny when we looked threw  the binoculars.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382

Two amber orbs observed in Henderson Nevada;2017-08-30 22:00:00;10 seconds;Two amber orbs observed in Henderson Nevada While leaving work and walking to my Jeep that was parked on the top level of a parking garage.  I observed two amber orbs (the color of fire) defending from rain clouds and disappear behind a mountain range.  The mountain range is directly south of Area 51.  I was looking straight north when I observed this event.   There were thunderstorms in the area at the time and it appeared that this object descended as one object and split into at least two objects.   I work as a Surveillance Supervisor at a Casino and was able to review video from a camera on another parking structure, and it confirmed what I saw, and the times.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382

30 white lights (satellites ?) travelling in a line disappearing into the sky at same point, no sound,  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-24 05:40:00;90 seconds;30 white lights (satellites ?) travelling in a line disappearing into the sky at same point, no sound, 90 seconds On the morning of Tuesday March 24, 2020 at 0540 in the morning I let my dogs out to go to the bathroom. I usually accompany them, as my puppy won’t go unless I do. My usual stance is to look into the sky at the stars, usually seeing the little dipper. While doing so this morning I thought it was odd that there were so many stars visible, when I noticed some of them were moving and moving at an accelerated pace. I at first thought they might be satellites, but they were moving too quickly for that and there were too many of them. I continued watching and to my amazement there were approximately 30 white dots, off in the distance, moving from the southwest to the east in a line, following each other. Most of them were equally spaced, but a few were off either to the right or left and then there was one that was trailing and looked like it was trying to catch up. There were no clouds in the sky and they all seemed to disappear at the exact spot in the sky. All! of this took place in a matter of about a 90 seconds;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382

They had Orange flashing lights. 2 of the objects were very,very close together.  The 3rd trailed behind. The object's altitude was about 1500 feet.  The 2 objects that were together moved further away from the 3rd. Once they had moved about 5000 feet from 3rd they flashed their orange light brighter 1 time then they were no longer visible.  The 3rd object contined flying toward their last location. It suddenly was not visible,  no bright flash.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
