Then I took five pictures on the last day I saw it.  The last day it was visible, there was definitely something different about the object or phenomenon in the sky.   When I later looked at the pictures, I was stunned, there was a box shape in the sun and a huge diamond formation above it, then a bright light shining above that.  I couldn't believe what the picture looked like, versus what the naked eye saw. I took the pictures with my cell phone and I still have the phone with pics.  I have the pictures on my current phone as well because I'm still amazed at what I saw and why no neighbors or news organizations where reporting anything.  The diamond shaped one is perfect shaped of many diamonds put together, kind of like seeing an H bomb explode. The smaller square shape looked like something manned to me. I wonder if I have the only pictures? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
