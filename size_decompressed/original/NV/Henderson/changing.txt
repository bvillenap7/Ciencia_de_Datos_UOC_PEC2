UFOs over henderson, nv;2007-10-13 08:35:00;1.5;UFOs over henderson, nv On 8/13/07, I was walking out of my in-laws house in Henderson, NV to go to Long's Drug Store for a bottle of wine. Facing south, I look to the sky(as I always do) to look at the airplanes coming in for landing. I saw a light that looked like it could have been part of the flight path for LAS. The light was traveling from south to north-northeast changing shapes. Changing shapes like from diamond to oval to circle, at no pattern. At this point, I was transfixed. It took about 45 sec. to respond as I was not sure what I was looking at. Then two other lights, also flashing different colors and shapes, were lined up in the same area as I saw the first. All three were moving at the same speed and sames direction but at some distance apart. That was when I walked backwards to open the front door and ask someone to come out. My mother-in-law came out to see all three lights in the sky. It seemed to me that all three were going north-northeast on gaining altitude. We followed them for about 1:30 min. before it they were out of sight. The distance was about 30 miles in 2 minutes. That's about 900 mph. Unless it was military doing experiments or more than likely, UFOs.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Photos I took of UFO changing shapes and making very abrupt movements;2008-08-02 23:35:00;60 minutes;Photos I took of UFO changing shapes and making very abrupt movements My husband was smoking outside and my daughter was ouside sitting next to him when they saw a bright light not twinkling and rapidly moving and changing shapes. My daughter immediately when in the house to get me to witness what they saw so I went out and looked up at the sky and at first I thought it was a plane but when it rapdly moved I quickly went inside to get my camera and zoom in until I couldn't  zoom any further and kept shooting the camera every 5 seconds until it quickly disappeared. Upon uploading the pictures to the computer and as I viewed each picture there was a dramatic change in some and I also was able to catch a picture with a plane going by when it quickly moved as the plane flew by. The camera was in one place and not moved as I took each shot. Please;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Rapid shape changing bright white light vanishing.;2008-08-03 22:15:00;60 minutes;Rapid shape changing bright white light vanishing. I went outside to smoke a cigarette as I was smoking looking up into the sky I noticed this real bright white object. Staring at it because it was so bright white it amazed me because it elongated itself. So I then I opened the door and stuck my head calling for my daughters to come and see the UFO. My daughter was just as amazed as I was and as we were watching, this big bright light went behind the house and just disappeared. My daughter said that it was a shooting star but as at the angle it was coming down bright white as it was, it would have hit the ground exploding but there was no crash no big booming sound, it just vanished. After that my daughter called for her mom and sister and that is where my wife noticed if & brought out her tri-pod and camera. This opjected moved from side to side very very fast and changing shapes.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Brilliant white light, morphed to clearly defined rectangular black shape, emitted misty tail, all vanished w/ no trace.;2018-08-18 19:40:00;~2 minutes;Brilliant white light, morphed to clearly defined rectangular black shape, emitted misty tail, all vanished w/ no trace. I was returning home from Arizona the evening of August 17, 2018, about 7:40PM PDT.  I was driving north on I-11 (US93-95) and had just passed the Boulder City interchange when I noticed a brilliant light, WNW of my position about 35 degrees above the horizon.  The light appeared to be approaching Black Mountain but was off in the distance, seemingly 10-20 miles away.   I immediately assumed that it was simply a jet on final into McCarran airport, since the jet traffic routinely make their final turns at Black Mountain.  I glanced at it again about 30 seconds later and noticed that it hadnâ€™t moved in any closer.  Right then the light started to shimmer to a dull orange and went completely black and became a rectangular shaped black object, silhouetted against the dusk sky.  Though the overall object appeared quite small (maybe 1/6 of a full moon) the corners of the rectangle were sharply defined.   I glanced back at it again periodically every few seconds while ! driving and noticed after another 30 seconds a milky tail start to come out of the black rectangular object and cover it in mist.  Five seconds after that it had completely disappeared between my glances at it.  No mist just gone.  I would have assumed it was a meteor viewed face on, had it not been visible for almost 2 minutes in total.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
