I have no doubt of what I saw.;2001-05-01 17:30:00;3 minutes;I have no doubt of what I saw. It was around April, 2001 in Henderson, Nevada that I was standing in the parking lot of a commercial center.  Around 5:30 P.M., in daylight, I noticed in the sky over my right shoulder a craft hovering in the sky.  I was in the area of Pecos and Sunset Road facing east.  I looked at the craft, and it was in the distance, perhaps hovering somewhere between me and Hoover Dam at 2:30 O’Clock position.  I saw it for maybe 2 or 3 seconds and then the winds made a huge howling sound (like a whoosh)  and the craft moved at lightning speed and disappeared straight on to the horizon, first bearing right then left.  (At first I thought it was a Stealth from Nellis Airfore Base on exercise, but this craft was much larger than a Stealth, perhaps the size of maybe 100 feet wide and maybe 15 feet high.)  I dismissed it as something crazy as it was near the approach of McCarran Airport in Las Vegas, but I never forgot it, and no one will ever convince me that I had not seen an alien craft.  It wasn’t a saucer shape though… it was different….it was square, perhaps on a curved edge, as it is hazy in my recollection.  However,  it was definitely not a “round” or “oval” vehicle.  There was a certain squareness to it, perhaps with angular edges.  I remember lights too, from the interior.  Anyhow, saw your piece on CNN and decided to submit this.  It’s what I experienced.  What else can I say? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Bright light/red flashing lights;2001-11-17 22:30:00;approx 1 hr;Bright light/red flashing lights ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been observing a star.  However, that is only an educated guess on our part.  PD))   Had gone out on the balcony to see if there were any meteors, because I didn't think I would be up early enough to see the climax of the meteor shower the next morning. I noticed a very bright light in the sky, southeast of my home, and southeast of Black Mountain (I'm pretty much on Black Mountain).  At first I thought it was a star, but since I had been looking at the sky for the past few nights, this star seemed out of place.  It was very bright, bluish white, and seemed to twinkle more than than other stars.  It was bigger than the other stars, and didn't have a star shape.   I went back in the house, and came out about 15 minutes later.  The star was still there... still bright... still flickering.  I dont have a telescope, so I tried looking at this object through binoculars.  While I couldn't make out any shape, this object was a bright, bluish white light, and I could see red flashes.  I thought I saw what appeared to be other color flashes of blue and green, but those might have been illusions.  I did see clear flashes of red light, however.  Very clear.  I had never seen this in a star, so I sat and watched this object for a good half an hour, both with binoculars and without.  It just sat there.  There were lots of planes out at that hour, and the visibility in that part of the sky was very clear.  I thought maybe it was just a plane flying off into the distance, and figured I would see the light get smaller and smaller and just disappear, but it didn't.  It maintained the same level of brightness, and the red flashing lights - appearing to come from various areas of the border of the light - were very distinct.  It was definitely an unidentified object to me, so I went into the house again to see if I could locate a telephone number to call and report this.  I didn't know who to call, so looked on the internet and found your site.  Still not sure of whether to report this, I went back outside.  At that point, what I saw appeared to be gone. I'm still not sure I should be sending this in, but I figured that maybe someone else saw what I saw.  If anyone was looking at the sky tonite, surely they must have seen this.  And if others reported it as well, then numerous reports would only lend to the credibility of the appearance of whatever this was that I saw. I dont need anyone to contact me unless they need other information.  But if there's someone there who can suggest a better way to look at such objects - e.g., an inexpensive telescope or, what to do if I should see something like this again, well I would certainly appreciate any information.  Email contact is fine.   I checked the box that says there was an aura or haze around the object.  This might have been caused by the binoculars. I don't know for certain.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
bright white light in S.W. sky over Henderson, Nv. oval in shape;2009-10-21 19:35:00;10 sec;bright white light in S.W. sky over Henderson, Nv. oval in shape Bright white light,in south west sky- then grew dim, then bright again, then gone.  Maybe meteor, but way to big.  We are in the flight pattern, but this was to far south in the sky and shortly after a plan flew over the light was diagnol from the path of the plane. No sound. The shape of the light was more oval than round.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Saw the light in Las Vegas before it turned green and yellow;2011-09-14 19:45:00;30 seconds;Saw the light in Las Vegas before it turned green and yellow On Wednesday evening September 14, 2011 at approximately 7:45 P.M. local time I was driving Southbound on Executive Airport Rd in Henderson, Nevada.  I was driving parallel to and about 1 mile West of the runway at Henderson Airport. Since I am a pilot I always tend to scan the sky for aircraft.  I observed what appeared to be a small aircraft landing light moving from West to East and descending at about a 10 degree angle.  This made perfect sense since it was consistent with a small aircraft on a left base to Runway 35.   At this time it was only a small bright white light.  I then noticed that it was traveling at a greater speed than a small aircraft normally would in the traffic pattern.  My thought was that it was a hotshot pilot in a high performance aircraft. Right after I had that thought the white light grew to about 5 times it’s original size and turned a beautiful shade of green and yellow with a long tail of light trailing behind it. It was still descending at a 10 degree angle.  It then disappeared behind some foothills that are located about 5 miles South of the airport.  It was then apparent to me that I was a much greater distance from the light than I had originally thought.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Formation of lights over Black Mountain.;2015-05-13 21:00:00;1 minute;Formation of lights over Black Mountain. my wife was leaving with our 4 yr old niece and she came back in freaking out saying come look at this.I went out and over black mountain there was 10 to 12 lights all in a perfect  formation spread out totally equal spce between them.  She took a picture but it didn't come out good.  Then they went down behind black mountain.  These were no planes or jets or anything like that.  I've never seen anything like this before in my 52 yrs on this planet.  I THINK THEY were all red. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

At around 2130 on 11/05 I noticed bright lights in the sky that did not resemble any stars I’ve seen.;2019-11-05 21:30:00;Ongoing;At around 2130 on 11/05 I noticed bright lights in the sky that did not resemble any stars I’ve seen.  I decided to take a look at the lights with a high powered military rifle scope and noticed that there is a massive ship and or ships hovering above Las Vegas.  It spanned across the entire sky.  It had to be just outside the stratosphere but it was so large that it could be seen with great detail with a high powered scope.  Myself and 5 others saw the craft.   As of 22:54 on 11/08/19, the craft can still be seen in the sky but is at a much higher elevation and is a bit harder to notice the sharp detail from the other night.  I highly advise anyone in the Las Vegas area to take a look at the sky with a telescope or high powered scope and you will be amazed.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
