It was drifting westerly at no more than 20 knots. It appeared to be a cylinder but I thought it changed to have swept wings similar to a DC-9 for 5 or 10 seconds. However, it never gained any speed other than the 20 knots I mentioned. It was in the neighborhood of about 20 to 25,000 feet as it would be obscured by the cirrus deck directly above it for as much as 30 seconds at a time.  I watched a eastbound airliner go nearly over the top of it (separated by the cirrus deck) so I doubt that crew would see it. The east bound flight (I used to fly that airway a lot) should have been at FL 330 to 370 and moving at a normal speed and cutting a contrail behind it.  My wife verified what I was seeing though her eyes are not as good as mine.  I had her retrieve our digital camera, but the craft disappeared into the cirrus and never reappeared where I could photograph it. I have seen a number of craft over the years but have not previously reported them. This was definitely a UFO and no aircraft, balloon. To skeptics I would ask why it would drift against the prevailing wind if it was a balloon?;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
