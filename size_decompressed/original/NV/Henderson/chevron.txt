I saw what I thought was a toy stealth bomber appearing from behind some of the buildings in my complex.  I watched it because it was silent I didn’t have the jets on in the hot tub so I could hear a lot.  The craft had three circles on it that were a lighter color, they weren’t lit up or anything.  The craft itself was pitch black that’s how I could tell it apart from the sky which was a dark purple.  It was extremely low and small. It just barely cleared some palm trees in my complex, maybe 40 feet tall.  It didn’t look anything like a bird it looked more like a toy plane, and the only bird I have seen this big was a seagull.  And It wasn’t a bat because it looked like it was gliding.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
