3 UFOs spotted in Henderson, NV;2003-08-23 22:23:00;4 hours;3 UFOs spotted in Henderson, NV My husband, brother and I were outside in our backyard looking for Mars with our binoculars when my brother asked what star THAT was - he pointed to what looked like a star, but upon studying it appeared to have blinking red, blue and purple lights on it.  We looked through the binoculars at the star, and realized it indeed DID have blinking lights on it - they were very clear to both the naked eye AND through the binoculars.  As we all stood wondering what the hell it was, we noticed it was moving very strangely - we were all mezmorized.  I was so perplexed that I ven woke up our next door neighbors and showed them as well - EVERYONE was completely amazed as it was obviously NOT a plane of any sort.  We live near a small airport, and see planes every day.  This was NOT a plane.  After leaving my neighbors, I returned to the backyard to join my husband and brother, who had noticed very clearly ANOTHER UFO hovering VERY close to the ground seemingly only a few streets away - it seemed to be looking right at us.  We videotaped ALL of it.  There was also a VERY unusual amount of military air traffic that night, and four HUGE lighted government jets I have never seen before zoomed over our house towards the objects while we watched.  Pretty freaky.  When we went inside to watch our video, all of the close up footage was gone and almost ALL of the other coverage had also been erased, however we still have VERY clear footage of the first object we saw!

Jet-black, oval, fast, shiny, made sharp turns, Over Mccarran Airport/ Henderson.;2011-04-03 14:35:00;1 Minute;Jet-black, oval, fast, shiny, made sharp turns, Over Mccarran Airport/ Henderson. It was a black oval-shaped aircraft.  Nothing like I ever have seen before.  I first saw it while I was leaving Mccarran Airport the aircraft was directly south of the airport, I think it might have been in the restricted airspace area.  At first, it was flying normally, except it wasn't in the shape of any aircraft I had ever seen. But about 15 seconds after that, it made a sharp 165 degree turn, speed up, and dissappeard into the south over Henderson and Black Mountain.  At my view, it was very shiny and jet-black.  Also, it turned, from my view, from the size of a penny to the size of a pen dot.  This was while it was speeding up and dissappeared.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
