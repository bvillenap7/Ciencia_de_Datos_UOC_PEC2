Four bright orange/yellow lights in the Las Vegas Valley;2001-03-01 19:45:00;5 minutes;Four bright orange/yellow lights in the Las Vegas Valley We have a home in Henderson, NV. with a panoramic view of the entire Las Vegas valley.  My wife called me upstairs to look at the strange lights in the sky across the valley.  There were 4 bright orange/yellow brightly glowing balls of light.  The lights remained perfectly fixed.  I have a telescope set up. I  looked at the light and they were perfectly round, no wings or other support structures several times brighter than any light in the Las Vegas valley. After about three minutes of viewing, the lights still had not moved, I noticed jet fighters take off from Nellis AFB and go toward the lights. The fighters turned toward the lights and appeared to be on a course toward the lights.  The fighters had to traverse about 2/3 of the valley to get to the lights.  When they were half way to the lights the highest light blinked out, about 15 seconds latter two more lights blinked out at the same time and the fourth light went out about 5 seconds latter.  The jet fighter flew to where the lights were and then appeared to go in circles for the next five minutes before returning to the base.  As the fighter was searching the area two helicopters also moved into the area.  I believe the helicopters came from the North Las Vegas airport.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Red light over Lake Mead viewed from Henderson, Nevada.;2004-04-23 21:00:00;2 minutes;Red light over Lake Mead viewed from Henderson, Nevada. My father in-law and I were outside in the backyard watching several planes coming in from the east to land at McCarran Int. Airport.   As we follow the airplanes into the distance counting how many coming in, there was a red light standing still at the end of the traffic.  It seemed to be like the next airplane to come in but too far to be in the flight plan to land.  My father in-law said Hey, that's not a plane. I said That looks like it's over the lake or maybe past the lake. (Lake Mead)  We watched it for about a minute and then saw it start to travel straight up.  As it started to move, it seemed to slightly shimmy side to side while moving upwards in altitude.  It was hard to judge distance of travel but it lasted about 20 to 25 second before the light turned to a 45 degree angle and continue to ascend at a slower rate.   At the 45 degree angle, the light gradually faded as if it was ascending and traveling away from us. This lasted about 30 seconds before completely fading away.  Unfortunately, I did not have a camera and besides my camera would not have the resolution to pick up the light clearly.  There is no doubt, on my life, that this light was not something an ordinary aircraft could do. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Blue light screaming across the Nevada skyline;2010-12-08 20:35:00;2 seconds;Blue light screaming across the Nevada skyline I was pulling out of a fast food line up when my girlfriend and I looked up out of my windshield and saw a BRIGHT Blue object flying very fast across the skyline.  The Blue light gradually sped up and then disappeared.  Compared to surrounding aircraft (approx.400pmh) I can guess that it was around 200 times as fast as the aircrafts.  The craziest part is I have been searching for other posts regarding this sighting and I found a post on this site in Florida today/tonight that is the exact same description of what we saw. I think its very crazy that the same sighting was also seen in Florida. This also proves that it was either fast enough to travel across the country or seen 2 separate times to help prove my claim.  The crazy part for me and my GF is that as humans we have instinct and during this event my stomach dropped and I was really uncomfortable.  I love the outdoors, love looking at starts etc...and this was different, this was something I cannot explain! . INSANE!!!;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382

Lights above mountains south of Henderson.;2014-03-13 22:20:00;30 minutes;Lights above mountains south of henderson. Mostly Stationary.  It appeared to hover.  Blinking yellow, red, and blue.   We looked at it with binoculars and couldn't see a shape but you could see it changing colors.   Above flight path to  airport. we could see planes flying underneath it so it was pretty high up.   It was above the mountains in between south of Henderson and around where Lake Mead would be if the mountains were not there.   Four of us watched it for about a half hour.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
3 stationary red lights over Lake Las Vegas;2017-09-16 21:00:00;3 minutes;3 stationary red lights over Lake Las Vegas While outside at a concert at Lake Las Vegas, a solid red light appeared from the north.  There were no other lights on the craft.  It seemed stationary.   A minute or so later, 2 more red lights appeared and they all remained stationary in a triangular formation.  Many people looked up verifying this was an unusual occurrence.   One craft went to the west then seemed to just disappear, meaning you could not follow its direction.  The other two craft seemed to get smaller then they too just disappeared. In other words, it did not track across the sky.   I did take a picture.   The light comes out white, but when I enlarge it, the shape is a thick oval.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
White Streak over Henderson.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-18 17:29:00;3 seconds;White Streak over Henderson. Object was traveling on a east to west trajectory.  It seemed like a meteor in very low atmosphere entry, but object was perfectly round, with a very bright pure white streak as the orb appeared at the end of the streak on a very smooth and sharp motion.  As if generated by a CGI system, although this happened in our eyesight over the southern part of Henderson near Highway 15. Flights going into Mcarran (LAS) were seen on approach at a lower altitude, flights seemed to be headed towards Lake Mead for their final turn and approach before landing, at the vantage point, it seemed object was 5 times the size of a Boeing 737. Object had very sharp and defined edges within the white streak of light, no debris field behind or around its side.  Upon its final light emission a brilliant white orb could be seen at its end and light completely disappeared as if by a light switch, without any prior change is its coloration or brilliance. I have seen meteors showers, meteors, comets, and an avid astronomy amateur.  Most people would dismiss it as a lone meteor or space debris, this object showed no hallmarks of being either.

Line of approx 50 UFOs headed from So Cal toward Utah.   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-15 20:30:00;30 minutes;Line of approx 50 UFOs headed from So Cal toward Utah 50 + craft, High altitude, traveling in line from west to east, steady white light that didn't change as flew over.  2-3x speed of passenger liners, not on Flight-Tracker or Flight Aware, some not in line/formation.  Noted several moving opposite direction at slightly slower speed, and those headed opposite (east to west) stopped approx 21:10.  Possibly headed toward Dugway proving ground, maybe from direction of Edwards AFB Ca;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
15-20 Lights in the sky traveling in pairs.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-01 21:15:00;30 minutes;15-20 Lights in the sky traveling in pairs I was looking at the sky towards the east and I saw a white light traveling north east. Initially I thought it was a satellite until I noticed there was another one following behind. A couple of minutes later, and saw two more in the same formation heading in the same direction. I went in the house and told my husband, he came to look but they were too far away at that point. I went back to my phone call but keep watching the sky. A few minutes later there were three lights traveling together in the same direction, I yelled through the door to my husband and sat back down. One of the lights broke off from the other two and headed north west. My husband sat down with me at this point, and we noticed more lights appearing to come out of the clouds one by one, and head north east with the occasional one headed north west. I lost count at 15, but I would say there were up to 20 lights that did this. We watched as the majority of them went out of sight, but there were 3 to 4 that stayed in the general area. We continued to watch them for a while. They were moving slowly, but kind of spontaneously. I then noticed a cluster between 5-8 of very dim, flashing lights in the same area that appeared to be dancing around but all traveling in the same general direction (west-south west.);36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
