Six photos of unusal object at sunset on May 20th 05.;2005-05-20 20:03:00;1 min 27 sec;Six photos of unusal object at sunset on May 20th 05. On May 20th 05, I was standing in front of my house photographing an unusual cloud formation at sunset when I spotted an object that first appeared to me as a bird.  Within seconds I realized it wasn't a bird and couldn't discern what it was and continued to take pixs.  The object moved from WSW in a horizontal path to the north. I have shown the pictures to several friends.  One is a Air Traffic Controller and another is a retired AF Col. we can't figure out what it is.  One thought is balloons tied together but doesn't make sense based on speed and horizontal flight direction.   If I hadn't taken the six pictures myself I wouldn't believe what I saw. What is It?;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
shiny spherical object accompanies jet leaving McCarran airport.;2006-12-25 08:00:00;2 min;shiny spherical object accompanies jet leaving McCarran airport. I have been reluctant to report this, because my wife and I recently reported a sighting at our home in Arizona. (previous report, 12/04/06, apache junction, az).   I am 61, never saw anything like this before, now 2 in 3 weeks.  Anyway, my wife and I were at our son's house in Henderson with some other family members for Christmas, and about 8 am I stepped out in the back yard to smoke.  I was watching the planes going in and out of McCarran.   The east bound jets mostly went directly overhead.  I saw one of these jets, headed east, that was accompanied by another object, which was directly under the jet, travelling at exactly the same speed and direction.   It might have been about 100 feet under the jet.  It was very shiny, and did not have any wings.  It was simply a sphere.  It looked like it kept a constant distance from the jet.  I had a very clear view of the object and the plane, and comparing its size to that of the jet, I would guess it was maybe 20 ft in diameter.   My wife and 2 other people came outside, and they all 3 saw the same thing.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
White object with blue aurora around it located near Henderson Nevada Airport;2011-12-17 00:50:00;1 second;White object with blue aurora around it located near Henderson Nevada Airport A white elongated Ball with blue outlines located just above Henderson Nevada Airport, left at incredible speed moving west towards california, height was maybe 5000 to 8000 ft and the size of your thumbnail when hand is extended. When I contacted the local newspaper at 1:00 a.m. just after the event as stated above, I received an email back 37 minutes later trying to explain this by sending me an article but the acticle was dated 3 months ago and the acticle stated the object was moving west to east and the e-mail was from myself but had the newspaper advertisements as such. The object I saw moved east to west, are the newspapers also are imbeded in the cover up or are they lazy and dont care?;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Glowing red sphere that pulsated with light then dimmed, making it seem like it ascended to greater altitude.;2012-12-06 17:30:00;5 minutes;Glowing red sphere that pulsated with light then dimmed, making it seem like it ascended to greater altitude. On Thursday, December 06, 2012 my husband and I were on our way home from work and stopped in the Whitney Ranch area to pick up my niece.  While we were waiting (at around 5:30 pm) my husband noticed something strange in the night sky almost directly above us.  The object had been travelling rather fast from South to North when it came to a stop and hovered. This was the Southeast area of the Las Vegas valley.  This area happens to lie directly in the flight path to McCarran airport so it’s not unusual to see aircraft.  The object appeared to be a round sphere, glowing with pulsating red light.  By the way it stopped and hovered we first thought it might be a helicopter at high altitude but it didn’t have the normal lights you’d expect to see on any known aircraft.  It simply pulsated a glowing red light.  At one point, the pulse was rather large and shortly after that there seemed to be a white halo above it for a brief moment.  Immediately following this t! he object seemed to fly straight up very quickly.  The light seemed to become more and more distant and turned a dim white color and we assumed it was heading straight up to a much higher altitude.  This assumption proved incorrect however as we began driving (watching it through the sunroof) my fist impression was that it was taking off at a high speed.  Then I realized it only seemed to be moving because we were moving.  As we made turns through the neighborhood this continued which confirmed that it could not possibly be at the high altitude we thought it had climbed to.  The light had become very faint and it was hardly discernible amid the stars, but as we traveled the stars seemed to stay stationary while this object was obviously very close to us in relation.  It was higher than the incoming airplanes but I cannot judge the altitude.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
2 round balls of fire floating west to east across the sky then up and out.;2014-01-01 00:01:00;4 minutes;2 round balls of fire floating west to east across the sky then up and out On New Year Eve January 1st 2014 between 12:01 and 12:05 we were in our bedroom looking out the sky and taking in the fireworks over Las Vegas both on TV and out the window. We witnessed two bright orange balls of fire cross the sky.  The objects came from the direction of Primm towards Las Vegas.  I would estimate the speed at 300 to 400 mph and the altitude was 8000 feet.  One first crossed the sky and I watched it go up into the sky and disappear.  Approximately three minutes later a second fire ball following the identical flight path repeated. I would estimate the size of each object to have been 20 feet in diameter. The flames were clear to see.  The whole object was a glow.  The flames were going up, the flames were not training behind.  We were thinking that it was a new fireworks device in the form of a drone because it was flying.  It was not shooting across the sky it was floating across the sky. It has been 36.5 hours since we have seen the objects and we are deeply concerned.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
I looked into the sky and saw two solid, white circular lights moving at the same speed, in the same direction.;2014-04-24 20:30:00;5-10 minutes;I was sitting in my car, after coming home from a dinner, when I looked into the sky and saw two soild, white circular lights moving at the same speed, in the same direction.  The light in front of the other one was more faint, and both lights were consistent with their brightness.  These looked very high in the sky. I tried tracking these lights as far as I could, but eventually they faded into the night sky.   After observing more, I saw two blinking planes flying in the same pattern, in the same direction as the previous two lights! I was shocked!   After these planes were far in the distance, I looked directly up, and saw, YET ANOTHER faint orb travelling what seems to be very high in the sky, possibly above our atmosphere. It was moving in the opposite direction of the two previous sightings.  After this, I saw the last UFO, very similar to the previous one, and on the same path, except it was moving in the opposite direction. I have a video and picture of the first sighting.  I have lived in Las Vegas my entire life (22yo), and I know what planes (both commercial and military, we have bases near here) look like in the sky... the four orbs were NOT planes! I do believe the blinking objects were planes, but I found it quite curious they were in the same formation and flying in the same direction. :)  Maybe our military keeping an eye on things?;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382

It was so bright like a giant LED light.  It shot across the sky fast like a shooting star, and I thought that it was at first (I grew up in the country and have witnessed many).  It went from shooting across the sky, to almost a slow glide.   At that point it regained my curosity, I see airplanes and helicopters every single night here in Vegas.   I'm not a dummy,  I consider myself pretty street-smart.  I am 100% positive I saw what I described. After the glide, it went out of view behind a tree, and disappeared.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382

A small, luminous orb was witnessed to the North, slightly above rooftop level, traveling swiftly from West to East at an upward angle of approximately twenty degrees.     It traveled some distance at this angle, came to a quick, sudden stop in mid-air, then shot straight up and disappeared in to the clouds.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
