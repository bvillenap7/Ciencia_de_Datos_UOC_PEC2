Very tall and slim pyramid shape on it's side. The point was heading south. Black. silent;2009-06-05 03:00:00;5 min;Very tall and slim pyramid shape on it's side. The point was heading south. Black. silent My family and I were out back swimming, we had the grill going, when we all saw some big black (silent) thing. The back was a triangle ,that tapered off to a point in the front. It seemed to be oscilating. Not even a second later we saw two army jets following this thing in formation. Going the same speed, and making alot of noise that the first didn't. Usually these sightings are considered to be either military or civilian aircraft. The best way that I can describe it is as a 150 yd long, silent, black, 3 sided, traffic cone. Without the ends and very stiff and sharp, oscilating.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382

It covered so much space in such short time with no sonic boom or trail so I know it was not a shooting star or airplane.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Red and White lights over Henderson, NV...very fast and quickly changing directions.;2012-01-25 19:00:00;30 minutes;Red and White lights over Henderson, NV...very fast and quickly changing directions. I was watching the south western sky and noticed a bright set of steady red lights moving from the southwest to the northeast.  The speed was faster than anything moving in the sky and then the lights suddenly changed direction to move due east. I followed with binoculars for several minutes until it was out of view. About 5 minutes later I witnessed 2 more craft moving from the southwest to the northeast and they maintained the same path without changing direction. The last sighting was about 5 minutes later and this one was the most incredible.  Again a set of red lights that changed to white and back to red.  Approximately 2-4 lights.  This one moved from the southwest heading north east and after about a minute, completely turned around and went back the way it came from.  Then it turned again to the north and then turned due east going directly over my house.  I don't know what it was, but the speed and constant lights, not blinking was like nothing else in the sky.  This is the 3rd day this month that I have seen something that is not an airplane moving in the sky over Henderson and almost always moving from the south or southwest to the east or northeast.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382

I saw a huge triangluar shaped ship close up only about 600 ft above me for about 45 seconds and then it disappeared.;2015-05-30 20:00:00;45 seconds;I saw a huge triangluar shaped ship close up only about 600 ft above me for about 45 seconds and then it disappeared. UFO Report   May 30, 2015.           On Saturday, May 30, 2015, at approximately 8:00 PM, over the Green Valley area of Henderson, NV, my wife and I got in the car to go out and eat, like we do every Saturday night.   We got in the car and turned around the corner just a 100 ft from our home and a bright light caught the corner of eye and I looked up and couldn't believe what I was seeing.  There was a huge triangular shaped black ship with seven large bright lights on the two sides of the V-shaped front.   I could see the ship up close, as I am sure it was below 1000 ft elevation and still daylight. It had been a rainy and overcast day in the Las Vegas area and it appeared that the ship had just popped out of a low cloud bank.    My wife couldn't see it, as she was sitting on the other side of the car, so I stopped and asked her to get out and look up, but just as she started get out, it disappeared.  It was like someone turned a switch and it disappeared before my eyes.  I had a clear visual look at the ship for about! 45 seconds.   The ship was large with a 300 to 500 ft long triangular sides and looked like a flat black wing which seemed very super sonic.  The unusual thing was the lights, they were not mounted on the superstructure.  There was a rigging made with black pipes attached to the fuselage that held the lights and protruded out from the ship about 10 feet.  I questioned how they could fly through the atmosphere at high speed with lights like that.   There were seven lights, one right on the point and 3 each down each side.  They were large,  rectangular, the longest length vertical.  They were 3 or 4 ft high and 2 or 3 ft wide.  The ship was moving very slow, less than 30 miles an hour and there was no noise of visible engines or intakes. I am very familiar with the B2 bomber, as a saw it fly over very low over us at at the Rose Parade, several years ago.  I also had the opportunity to stand under it at Nellis AFB during Air Force air show a few years ago.  The  ship I saw was bigger than the B2, possibly two or three times the size.  It is scary to even think about this huge thing was hovering only about five or six hundred above the roof tops of the homes in the Las Vegas area.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
