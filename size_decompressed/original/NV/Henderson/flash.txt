Large flashes of lights behind mountains in Henderson, but no clouds.;2015-09-08 01:00:00;13 minutes;Large flashes of lights behind mountains in Henderson, but no clouds. We were driving on the freeway towards the green valley casino in Henderson, and to our right behind the mountains there were big flashes of lights.   I thought it lightning, at first, but there were no clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and/or date may be flawed.  The correct date may be September 09.

Flashes of light in the sky, brighter and higher then planes, a little larger, distance unknown.;2017-08-15 21:40:00;2-4 minutes;Flashes of light in the sky, brighter and higher then planes, a little larger, distance unknown. Saw a flash that faded out in about a second to North/North East every 10-30 seconds.  It was bright enough to catch my attention (I wasn't looking up, originally).  It was also higher than the planes flying by.  Every flash was dimmer than the last. Wondering if it could have been a dieing star?  I never seen one before and am not sure if you can with your naked eye.  Hoping someone else saw it when it was maybe brighter or knows of any astronomical events. Thanks;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
Pure white flashes as if it was pure energy flying in many different directions;2019-06-01 01:19:00;15 minutes;Pure white flashes as if it was pure energy flying in many different directions I was hiking with a buddy of mine, searching for these objects I’ve been seeing them for the passed year now.  So him and I went out to a dark side of the mountain where there was little light pollution.  We walked for maybe an hour in a half and we saw it by NAFB with these really bright flashes some went quick and some stayed for about thirty seconds we had lost it when it was above NAFB then it had re apesrd in front of us heading toward lake mead area.  Mind you these are all different objects some flash many different colors and some just sit there then disappear after a while, if you weren’t to pay attention to the sky you wouldn’t even realize how many you could see.;36.020389914163;-115.050717167382
