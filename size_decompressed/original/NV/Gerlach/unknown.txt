Single erratic orange light;2018-10-14 20:00:00;ten minutes;Single erratic orange light I was on a weekend long hunting trip October 12-15, 2018 with two hunting buddies.  We changed camping locations after the first two nights, reasons unrelated to the sighting.  One person headed to bed about an hour after it got dark while the other person and I remained awake for a little while, just looking at the dark sky (no campfire, dimmed camp lantern) and talking.  I don't recall exactly what time it was during the sighting but I assume it was sometime after 8pm.  We were facing south east from the coordinates (40°46'58.42N, 119°30'58.67W)  and saw a single orange light rise up from the horizon, unsure of the distance from it.  It maintained a steady vertical path until it got close to the moon.  I only mention it since the moon was a fixed point in the sky we used for reference.  Once it neared the moon, it started darting all over the place, up, down, diagonal, no apparent pattern or reason for movement.  It slowed at one point and alm! ost appeared to hover for ten seconds or so then continued the erratic movement.  Then it headed our direction in a straight line, no erratic movement.  Once it grew closer, we could hear something very faint, almost like a commercial airline at cruising altitude but it was nowhere that high.  I'd say it wasn't more than a couple thousand feet off the ground, if that.  It was not moving fast at all as it flew by us.  I'd guess that it was only a couple miles away from us but we couldn't see anything other than the one orange light.  It didn't pulse, get brighter, nothing, just solid the whole time.  We watched it for another couple of minutes until it disappeared over the northwest horizon.  Both of us were frozen, stuck in our chairs, too awe struck to get our phones in the truck.;40.6564;-119.3579
