LIGHTS -OVER- BURNING MAN 2006-  DURING THE BURN!!!;2006-09-02 22:00:00;15-20 sec.;LIGHTS -OVER- BURNING MAN 2006-  DURING THE BURN!!! We attended the Burning Man Festival in 2006. On the night of the big burn, we climbed an observation deck we’d built to watch the festivities from afar. As the 'man' was burning, I happened to look up and saw a set of 5 green lights traveling in a single file line formation from east to west. The lights passed over the burn site. When the lights were directly overhead, they rotated counter clockwise, and then shot off NNW in an abrupt manner. My colleague, his girlfriend, and myself witnessed the event. No other shape was visible besides the green lights. It could have been one craft or five. There was no sound associated with the sighting.  That was my sixth time attending the event.  I’ve seen strange and astounding feats of light and sound many times before.  HOWEVER, There was absolutely no doubt in my mind of what I saw that night.;40.6564;-119.3579
