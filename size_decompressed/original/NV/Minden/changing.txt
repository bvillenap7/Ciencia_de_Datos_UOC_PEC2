We had called your hotline as well to report this. There was a bright dark orange/red light that was moving across the sky south to north.  We were observing it from the west looking towards the east.  It apeared to be a plane or a helicopter so it was about 4 times brighter than a star, However there was no noise while it moved across the sky about 45 degrees (favoring the north) than it stopped and than started and stopped a few times.  After about a minute it started to get smaller as if it was moving further away from us. During this the light elongated into a line instead of a sphere which seemed to have a whitish bluish light with the orange. Than it completly vanished. It seemed to close to be a satalite, or space station.;39.0207;-119.7277
