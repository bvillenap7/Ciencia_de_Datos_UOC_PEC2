At approximately 2100 hours, after an extremely hot day, my friend and I were outside enjoying the cooler night air when he shouted, Look, look while pointing toward the south-east sky.  We watched a whitish-yellow colored, fireball break up into two pieces for approximately 1 full minute.  Before the object flew behind the mountains, we observed it break up into several pieces.  I have witnessed Perseid fireballs in the past.  This object moved much slower.  I believe it may have been a large piece of space junk.   I also contacted DCSO on the non-emergency line and was informed that they had taken  several reports of the object.  ((name deleted));39.0207;-119.7277
