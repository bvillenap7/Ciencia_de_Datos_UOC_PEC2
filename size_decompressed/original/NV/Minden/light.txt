Stopped about my 12 o'clock blew up into a bright ball (about 3 seconds) and then continued north.  Amazing.  I still have the chills.  I have been a UFO researcher for my entire lifeâ€¦  My first sighting.  WOW!!!;39.0207;-119.7277
Starlight objects moving rapidly in a straight line across the sky.;2021-05-05 04:40:00;3-4 minutes;Starlight objects moving rapidly in a straight line across the sky. I went outside to watch for meteors at approximately 4:40 am. As I looked straight up I observed a train of starlight objects travelling in a straight line coming from the northwest and heading southeast directly towards the moon. Some were closer together than others but all were in a straight line and moving very fast across the sky. I went inside to grab my phone in time to try to photograph them. I counted the last 20 of them as they disappeared into the moonlight, but there was at least that many more before I ran back into the house to get my phone. I've never seen anything like that before.;39.0207;-119.7277
