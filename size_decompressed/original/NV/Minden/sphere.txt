driving up mountian road,observed 3 large round balls hanging in mid-air;1983-09-15 05:00:00;10 minutes;driving up mountian road,observed 3 large round balls hanging in mid-air on my way to work at Lake Tahoe from Carson Valley between 430 and 5 am I observed three silvery-blue balls , larger than houses, hanging in mid-air  off to my right and to the North of Kingsbury grade.  maybe only 130 meters from the road at one point.  as I took the curves up this mt.road the objects would fade from view and then re-appear, untill I had passed that canyon and was well above it,and view was hidden by tree line. No lights or windows  were observed  they reminded me of enormous baloons but could not tell if they were metallic. I was driving taxi at that time and went to work  not making a report but telling a few of my friends about it ,    of course no one had any notion of what it could have been, but several years later in casual conversation with a sranger the subject of UFOs came up and he told of seeing the same thing at the same place except he was observing from highway 395 heading south into Minden (at least 2-3 miles out in the valley.;39.0207;-119.7277
