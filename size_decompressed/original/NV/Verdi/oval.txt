While returning from Boomtown near Reno I saw a yellow object in the ski that was like nothing I had ever seen before. I was about 7,000 feet up as I was around 4,500 on interstate 80 heading west toward Sacramento. It was like a giant yellow light bulb but shaped more like a bell curve. It seemed almost translucent but it really was not. It was really beautiful to look at for the few seconds that I saw it. I was driving and there were mountains in the area blocking my view after I came around a bend in the road.;39.5139;-119.9833
