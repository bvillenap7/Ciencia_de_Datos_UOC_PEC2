Silver and black craft that showed up for one frame of a video - silent.  ((NUFORC Note:  Bird or insect in flight??  PD));2018-06-24 18:13:00;1 second;Silver and black craft that showed up for one frame of a video - silent. I took what I thought was a photo of myself lounging by the pool at Horseshu Hotel & Casino to capture my holiday. The photo was taken facing West. When I went to post it I noticed it was actually a short live video. In one split second/frame of the video a large craft appears. It just shows itself like a blip. Black and angular - looks like some sort of craft and appears to be larger than than the two story water tower in the background. I was by myself when it happened and when I showed it to the hotel staff it was all they could talk about. Almost looks like a plume of something is coming out from below - silver on top with a shadowy dark bottom. Made no sound when it appeared.;41.8882;-114.7233
