Spotted aluminum-colored square-shaped blinking lights which disappeared, car stopped & red/orange ball followed us.;1980-09-15 22:00:00;15 mins to 4 hrs;Spotted aluminum-colored square-shaped blinking lights which disappeared, car stopped & red/orange ball followed us. In September 1980, I was driving from San Jose, CA to Denver, CO along with my son and our two dogs.  As we were approaching Elko, Nevada, I saw a sign that said Elko 18 miles straight ahead and a road that went off to the right and straight up the mountain.  I mentioned to my son that the road looked like an interesting one to explore and that we should come back later (we had planned to spend the night in Elko) and do just that. We set up camp in a park on the edge of Elko, ate and then took the dogs with us and set out to explore that curious road. It was getting dark as we headed out and was very dark by the time we got up in the mountain.  It was very quiet, very dark and very desolate up there and we decided to abandon our search and turned around and headed back down the mountain. My son was driving and I was sitting in the passenger seat and the two dogs were in the back.  Suddenly, off to my right a bright light caught my eye.  Both my son and I said at the same time did you see that?  It looked like a huge billboard type of thing with aluminum colored glowing squares that were blinking in some strange kind of pattern.  The minute we noticed it, it stopped blinking and disappeared.  I mean disappeared completely as though nothing at all had been there.  There was just an empty meadow where this thing had been.  The altimeter  ((sic.  Please see below.)) light came on in the car and the engine stopped running.  So I told my son to turn the car off and we would sit there for awhile.  Soon we heard foot steps coming toward the car which unnerved us to say the least.  But strangest of all was that the dogs did NOT bark.  I got worried and thought it was best to get out of there and told my son to start the car and let's go!  He reminded me that the car wouldn't start and I just told him to try again--it would start (I was kind of frantic). The car did start and we started down the mountain again, but by then I was regaining my composure and told him to go slow, real slow.  I turned around to look and there was an reddish-orangeish round light floating above the road (maybe 10 or l5 feet above)and it followed us down the mountain, almost to the bottom and then disappeared. When we got back to the campground it was around 2:30 in the morning so I do not know where all the time went as it didn't seem that we were up there for very long.  When we got back we were sitting outside, still in amazement over what we had seen when I looked up and there I was about 5 green lights and they were in some sort of formation that looked to me as though they were dancing to some sort of celestial music!  I know how improbable that sounds, especially after what we had just seen on the mountain, but I swear to God it is the truth.  We were not stoned, not drunk and not crazy.  Straight and totally in awe! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP REPORT FROM WITNESS)) correction to  12/15/03 report On December 15, 2003, I submitted a report in which I said the car's 'altimeter' light came on.  What I meant to say was 'alternator light'. ((END));40.8860086956522;-115.592391304348

Soild Beam of Light Lazer;2005-10-27 03:00:00;light;Soild Beam of Light Lazer My dad came to my football game in Elko Nv. I live in reno Nv, I was on the football teamHug Hawks.Game over my dad drove me and my girlfriend home, his truck did not have the dip stick for tranmisson, he knew of this and told us to go to the bathroom now because he is not stoping. About a hour into the dive i fall a sleep, my dad keeps go ahead on I-80 west. My dad had to go to the bathroom so he pulled over and his truck take a dive rocking the truck. At the same time a cop put his lights up and pulls my dad over. He says my dads tail lights did not work, but he falt bad for my dad because he put over 5k in the truck and had the bill to show that he just took the truck to the shop. But my dads truck did not start, the cop called for a tow truck... We wait for a hour then my dad calls everyone to get some help, then my girlfriend said she got (AAA) to tow the truck. I my dad and girlfriend wait for a half an hour, then I start watching my game that I just played. After watching the game I heared the bus that I rode on to get to the game pass bye. I start to fell a sleep, then my dad wakes me in a vocie that I could tell something was wrong. He ask me to look at a light at some what the top of the hill, I say about 500 foot hill. I looked at the light I said its some house light, then right one time the light starts to movie to the right fast, going over all hills, rocks, bushes, and not rocking the light. It was a soild beam of light pointing right at me and my dad. Moving very fast the beam of light was all way on us. The light moved side to side about 45deg left and 45deg right very fast. Then I woke my girlfriend she said the same thing i said the frist time but I and my dad said just look at the light now all 3 of us was look at a beam of light high in the hill, as it start to move my girlfriend jumps in the truck. My dad pointing a flash light at the light and it stoped and as all way was about 5 feet above the ground, my dad truned off the light and the beam of light would start to move toward us. Right away my dad turn the light on the beam of light would stop but not for long. It would start to moving side to side, and come closer and closer to me and my dad. My dad was not very happy with what is going on he gaves me a knive, and the light. He starts to call the tow truck tell the what is going on and we need to get out of there. As times pasts it get down the hill and now in the valley, now about 500 yards way form us. I with knive in hand and light start to walk towards the light, the beam was moving side to side so i just walk in a straight line form the truck. I pointed the light at the beam of light and start to walk away form the truck about a 50 yards my dad was about 25 yard way. He was talk to the tow truck guy. I think it took them 3 hours to get there. But any way as I'm walk to the beam of light I heard no sounds, the beam of light came at me so fast it was not funny. It was so close I could see the bushes and the little hill on the land, at the same time I saw the light in a better veiw. It did not light up anything that was not in the beam, like a lazer. I ran to the truck and my dad fallowed, we all jumped in the truck and waited. As the light movie side to side it was about 200 yards a way. We just waited as it got closer then start to back up, but then it would move so fast i dont even really think any would go that fast then stop and move to the right and left. I was scared my dad was scared my girlfriend was scared. As we watched the light move for about 30 more mins. The tow truck guys came, the frist thing we said was can u look at that light, as he did he was like its nottin, just like me the beam of light started to move. He went to work get us out of their, 15 mins of look at the light we were got out of there. But as we left the light rose form the ground and start to fellow us about 5 miles the light went away. I cant say the light was a UFO or something esle, just because the street we broke down on name is Grave Yard or something like that. Just that makes me fill I cant say what it was, all i can say is I saw what I saw... It Was a clean Light like a lazer. ((name deleted));40.8860086956522;-115.592391304348
2  large Red stationary lights , time span of 16 minutes, above Elko, Nv  on 06/14/08 at 23:00;2008-06-14 23:00:00;16 minutes;2  large Red stationary lights , time span of 16 minutes, above Elko, Nv  on 06/14/08 at 23:00 It is Sunday,  June 15,2008.        Last night, June 14, 2008, My Husband and I saw two red “balls of light”.        I stepped outside at approximately 11:00 P.M. and immediately noticed two red lights in the sky where there aren’t usually any.        From where we are, they appeared to be over Elko, Nevada,  to the East and South of the Airport.    We have often watched incoming airplanes at night and they appear to stay in nearly the same place for long periods although they are coming closer.    Their white lights just seem to gradually get larger.    The red lights never seemed to get larger or smaller as we watched.       When I hold my hand sideways, they were about 3 fingers high “over” the town.     Size  close to my smallest fingernail with arm outstretched.      I hollered at my husband to come see,  and we watched for awhile. We each went back inside several times to get the binoculars and to locate the scope,  and to get the camcorder and such.     ( One of us watching the lights while the other was inside).      The camcorder’s battery was completely dead.     I tried to get a photo with the cell phone , but that didn’t work either.      The lights stayed stationary for probably 16 minutes or so.     We also turned on the C.B. radio to see if any  truckers traveling on Interstate 80 were talking about them.  (nothing).     The last time that I went inside, the lights left while my husband watched.      He said that they appeared to go slowly higher and then towards the South East and out of sight.     I was only inside about a minute,  so they were not moving real slow.   I have watched airplanes leaving that stayed in sight for an hour or more.     I looked at the clock  and wrote  down the time at that point.  It was 11:16 P.M. Pacific time.            We had seen flares on the night of February 21, 2008, about 90 miles North of Elko.   The flares were orange, and there were 8 or 9 sonic booms as some fighter jets shot something out of the sky.       Something lit up brigh! tly behi nd a cloud, and it was “daylight” momentarily.    (We were driving on the highway and had pulled over to watch).      There is an airbase close by that area of Idaho, so it could have been some sort of training drill.      Our faces, particularly our eyes, were puffy, red and sore the next day. (My eyes stayed swollen for over a month).   We looked as though we had a sunburn, but without the usual outline of our sunglasses.     That same day,  Feb. 21,  early in the morning,  Wells, Nevada (50 miles East of Elko) had a 6.0 Earthquake.     The flares on the  night of Feb. 21, drifted downwards and Westerly and they sort of glowingly flickered like flares do.     The red lights on June 14 were different than those. We can’t rule out some sort of celebration for flag day (however, NOT fireworks).    Maybe two VERY large, lighted, anchored balloons?      There is also a  NOAA station here.      Do the weather balloons have large red lights and get released at night?      Would they stay stationary for so long?       We don’t know.     We have watched weather balloons being released before,  but in the daytime,  and they moved off rather quickly.         I read where you mentioned the space shuttle and International Space Station.     Maybe that’s what it was.    Well, anyway, that’s it for now.      We wanted to report it so as to validate if someone else reports the same thing.                        Thank you so much for your service, and best wishes on your Washington State Legislature Candidacy.;40.8860086956522;-115.592391304348
Two brilliant, solid red lights moving slowly across the skies in Northeast Nevada;2008-06-14 23:05:00;5-7 minutes;Two brilliant, solid red lights moving slowly across the skies in Northeast Nevada My sons and I observed two brilliant points of red light, traveling slowly from northwest to southeast, across the sky this evening.   The lights were the color of laser pointers, twinkling from time to time, but mostly solid.   They moved very little in relation to each other, and traveled from the point they were first observed about 1/3 of the way across the clear sky.  They were moving too slowly to be jet aircraft at normal altitudes.   Although it was quiet out, there was no noise at all.   We looked at them through binoculars, but this did not bring any additional resolution. Quite suddenly, the southernmost light began to fade.  I watched it disappear through the binoculars.  My 10 year old son exclaimed, Dad, look at the other one!   When I brought the binoculars down, the other one, blinking now, dove almost due south at a phenomenal rate of speed and disappeared over my roof. I am 40 years old, and have observed satellites and aircraft over the clear Nevada skies all of my life.  I’ve also seen vapor trails from military rockets fired from southern California.   But what I saw tonight was completely out of my experience.;40.8860086956522;-115.592391304348

Two stationary red lights spotted by multiple persons flashing over Elko Nevada.;2009-01-31 10:15:00;20 mimutes;Two stationary red lights spotted by multiple persons flashing over Elko Nevada. There were two red lights over Elko Airport. They were well elevated and appeared stationary. I tried to take a picture but all I had was my cell phone camera and the light did not pick up on the camera. I drove back to work—about 3 miles away. The lights remained. I had a coworker shut down the parking lot lights and he visually confirmed by him. I called home, which is about 10-15 mile away and my 17 year old son and my wife could see them also. They may have drifted eastwards. They seemed to flash. One disappeared and the other remained for several minutes. It then flashed and disappeared. There elevation was hard to determine, but were not low as they were visible over terrain that rises bout 1000 ft over the valley floor.  As for the observers, we are both US Govt employees. We also received calls from two unknown individuals requesting information and if we had any equipment in the sky, which we did not. We are both educated and on the job while this happened.;40.8860086956522;-115.592391304348
My friend noticed a bright light outside my window. We watched it for a while.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable star or planet?  PD));2009-06-14 01:00:00;Hour;A friend and I were getting ready for bed when my friend noticed a bright light outside my window. We watched it for a while and saw it moving. We determined it was not a satalite because it was sort of hovering and moving in odd patterns. There were two other stars on each side that were not as bright. We called a friend and he watched it move too and determined we were not crazy. We watched it for about an hour until it was getting very dim and we were so tired we began to fall asleep.

I couldn't hear any sound of aircraft and they were moving at a good pace.   After a few minutes, the lights just kind of faded out.   I don't believe it to be a normal aircraft because the area is very mountainous and the lights were too low for a normal plane to fly;40.8860086956522;-115.592391304348
