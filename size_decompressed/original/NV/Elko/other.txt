It was a huge black mass that blotted out the sky, but had little lites under it, like it was trying to camoflage itself with the night sky. When I tried to leave, it lifted my truck up about 5 or 6 feet, then let it drop. I was able to get away, and drove to Carlin and spent the night there. After working on my truck, I decided to test her out on a long drive. I started the drive from Elko, NV, at about 19:30. I had been driving for about an hour and a half (I know this because the CD I was listening to takes about that long to play, and it was just about ending) when I saw this huge black mass blotting out the sky! It had know real shape, except for what looked like a point at the front (at least I think it was the front!) It had little lights on the underside of it that kind of made it look like part of the starry sky, but you could still see the craft, because lights coming from the Mts. and other surroundings vaguely showed its sillouette. The object made no sound. I stopped and shut down the truck, hoping this craft(?) wouldn't see me, but it did. It flew then stopped right over me. I got in the truck and turned the key, hoping it wouldn't turn into some bad horror movie, where the car NEVER starts! But it did! However, the truck wasn't moving. I realized that the truck was in the air about 5 or 6 feet. I was going to jump, but then the truck came crashing down. I rolled off  to the side, realizing that if I had jumped when I did, I would have been crushed. I sped away. I was amazed and really happy that my truck survived the fall. I drove to Carlin, NV, and spent the night there. The next day I checked out my truck, and I only broke some bushings, a front brake caliper, and the 2 back brake drums.

This is a possible ufo crash site very fresh.;2009-07-28 20:45:00;All  Night;This is a possible ufo crash site very fresh. On the night mentioned above my firefighting crew was standing outside, when the object came streaking across the sky with very large flames.  We thought a airplane on fire until it flew overhead. It was a strange shape and it had no wings, it was about the size of a vokeswagon bug.  It made a very loud noise when it hit the side of the mountain.   We called 911 and the volunteer firefighters came out and looked around did't see anything and left.  About a half hour later the military showed up and went to the exact spot where it hit.  The strange thing was they did't ask us any questions they knew exactly where to go.  They worked on the sight all night with a very large helicopter.   We went to investigate we found the possible crash site, we woke up very sick the next day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));40.8860086956522;-115.592391304348
