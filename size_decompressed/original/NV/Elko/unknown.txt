It played in the clouds;2002-05-13 10:25:00;20 min.;It played in the clouds I was on my way to work, but had to stop and pay a few bills and I could see a flash like the sun hitting on something in the sky.  I looked for it and when I found it, I knew it wasn't a plane just by the way it was moving.  It was just above the clouds. When I seen it it was moving very slow, then it would stop and go back in the direction it just came from.  I did this a few times, then it stopped and went up very slowly.  I have never seen anything like it before and if it is a UFO it is the first one I have seen.  Anyway it was like flying around and in the cloud, I had moved on up the street and then lost sight of it, but I know an airliner passed close to where I had seen it at. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the location of the sighting may be Elko, NV.  Hence, we have changed the spelling from Eldo.  PD));40.8860086956522;-115.592391304348
2 lights performed a slingshot maneuver obtaining great speed shooting off in opposite directions.;2005-08-15 22:00:00;15 second;Two lights performed a slingshot maneuver obtaining great speed shooting off in opposite directions from a geosync orbit above the eart Star gazing 20 miles east of Elko Nevada I spotted two what I suspected to be stars equaling in light intensity (white in color) as the serounding stars.    Suddenly the two lights focused my attention as they rotated about an axial point between them at a speed which the light started to streak.  Within one or two full rotations the lights shot off in opposite direction and vanished about 25% across the horizon each.  This leads me to believe the craft had reached or exceeded the speed of light at the point which they has vanished.   At the time the maneuver was performed, to the time the lights disappeared the duration was less then 1 second.  The lights (suspected to be stars) remained in what I believe now to be a Geosynchronous Orbit above the earthâ€™s atmosphere.  Total time of observation was about 15 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.8860086956522;-115.592391304348
