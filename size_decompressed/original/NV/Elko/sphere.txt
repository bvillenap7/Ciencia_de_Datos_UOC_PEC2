Spherical object at great height moving at high rate of speed from south to north;2006-12-29 14:00:00;15  minutes;Spherical object at great height moving at high rate of speed from south to north I am a freight pilot and my route takes me from Reno to Elko, NV.   On the 29th of December at approximately 1400 hrs. local, I was leaving the FBO and walking to my plane.  The day was severe clear and crisp.  There were a few contrails crossing  and nothing else.   I saw one of the linemen, looking up at the sky.  I asked what he was looking at and he directed my eyes to an object so high up it seemed to be against the blue of the sky.  The object looked like the ball at the end of a pushpin held at arm's length.  It was the color of quicksilver and looked perfectly spherical.   It was moving from south to north and we saw it pass behind a number of contrails some of which had to be in the FL400 range.   One more lineman came out to see the object and we observed it move north for about 15 minutes all told.  In the end, it simply vanished and we could not locate it anymore.   I think whatever it was had to be huge to appear that size to me.  The object didn't shimmer, shine or give off any sort of light.   I've no idea what it could have been.;40.8860086956522;-115.592391304348
Two VERY bright , transluscent spheres over Nevada;2007-05-30 22:00:00;2 weeks;Two VERY bright , transluscent spheres over Nevada About a week and a half ago, when leaving my house, an EXTREMELY bright light caught my attention.I pointed it out to my husband, asking him what it was.  He didn't  know but he said he saw it the night before.  It appeared to be stationary and it had several sattelites positioned around it.   We lost sight of it as we drove into town, so we planned to look at it with telescope when we got home.  When we got home an hour later it was gone.  But we did notice another one  by the moon(at about 10 oclock position) and we did look at it through the scope.  What we saw was a sort of transparent looking sphere with strange circles in it and to the left of the sphere at 8 o'clock was a much smaller light and to its right were three smaller lights in perfect alignment to 2 o'clock.  Every night since then I can see the one by the moon and I have not seen it move at all,  however, the first one I saw appears after dark  and moves at different times and rates of speed.  Tonight it started moving away at about 9:30pm and had disappeared from view within 1 hour.  What are they? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
