Three orange fireballs spotted by witness in Elko Nevada.;2013-12-31 22:25:00;3 minutes;Three orange fireballs spotted by witness in Elko Nevada. On the last evening of 2013 I stepped outside of my house and as I looked up at the sky, i saw three orange glowing balls each a considerable distance from each other.  At first I thought they were fireworks because it being new years, there was a lot of fireworks going off that night, but  it seemed they were on an eastward course.  They looked like orange flames in a ball and moved up and down slightly like a fly moves so I knew it wasn't an airplane.  They continued heading east and the one in the  rear started dropping blue light orbs out the bottom of it. I am unsure of how many orbs were dropped or if it was only one.  As they proceeded eastward one by one they faded out til their light was completely gone.  This sighting lasted a good couple minutes but through the whole experience I never thought to pull my phone out to record it.;40.8860086956522;-115.592391304348
