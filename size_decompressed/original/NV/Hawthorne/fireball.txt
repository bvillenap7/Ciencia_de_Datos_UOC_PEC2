Green ball of light flying parallel to school bus.;1981-01-15 22:00:00;2 minutes;Green ball of light flying parallel to school bus. I was traveling on a school bus on Highway 95 north, between Hawthorne and Fallon, Nevada, at around 10 p.m.  I looked out the window and saw a green glowing light flying level at the same speed as the bus.  I remember telling a couple of others sitting nearby, hey, check out that light.  I don't remember their response.   After watching a few minutes, I thought it must be some weird situation with the power lines along the highway, (though I don't know if power lines do run along that highway).   I then slept.
