diamond shaped craft from north to south, crossed orion constellation 2230 12/24/2010;2010-12-24 22:30:00;3 minutes;diamond shaped craft from north to south, crossed orion constellation 2230 12/24/2010 Last night, at about 1030pm our movie ended inside and I put on an episode of three sheets on hulu for michael and liv, Me and phil went down to attached garage and I lit up a  cigar while phil smoked a cigarette  I asked phil about a planet, he took out his droid and used the sky map app. It was jupiter and uranus. We also looked at orion  Phil asked me to look up at what he thought was a flock of birds.  To me It was a diamond shaped shiloutted object. With several lights that had a faint glow. It was very high up and quiet. We watched it for a moment as it drifted north to south across the constellation of orion. I ran to get my glasses from truck and lost track of it upon return.  Very weird, came from out north which is about 120 miles south of area 51 from me  It wasn't a regular plane due to appearance of shape, speed was about same, and I heard no noise  Phil anything to add or correct, make sure you use reply all so the thread continues  We immediately told michael and olivia when we came back up to apartment  This is as honest of an account as I can give;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Impossibly fast moving object near McCarran Airport.;2015-08-09 10:00:00;1 minute;Impossibly fast moving object near McCarran Airport I was traveling westbound on I-215 around warm springs exit.  I spotted small diamond shaped object westbound at about 500 feet.   I thought it may be a drone, however it accelerated and climbed at a tremendous rate until it reached high clouds about 10 miles away in the foothills, it did this in a few seconds.   Being close to McCarran airport, they might have picked something up on their radar.   The object left no trail.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
