Large fireball shape moving from east to west over the mtns.  Noticed  aircraft above it from a distance;2004-11-02 03:00:00;3-5 min;Large fireball shape moving from east to west over the mtns.  Noticed  aircraft above it from a distance Looking north out of my kitchen window over the nevada mtns. noticed what looked like a fireball going from east to west over the mtn.  It was large in comparison to the jets I can see taking off from the airport.  It looked like a teardrop sideways and was very orange/red with a tail behind it.  The color is what caught my eye looking out of the window.  Watched it until I couldn't see it anymore because of a building obstructing my view;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Long duration daylight sighting of 2 craft west/southwest of Las Vegas strip;2011-06-14 09:45:00;1 hour +;Long duration daylight sighting of 2 craft west/southwest of Las Vegas strip On Tuesday, June 14, 2011, my wife and I were at Aria Resort & Casino in Las Vegas on the 2nd day of our 5 day vacation.  When in Vegas, our routine is to get to the pool at or around the time they open, which is typically 9:00 am.  That day we arrived at the pool, picked our spots, and were in the pool by 9:30.  At this time, half of Las Vegas is still asleep, so there were no more than 20 people at this pool at this time. Weather conditions: Hot (probably high 80’s already, I believe it got up to 103 later that day) not a single cloud in the sky. No wind. Shortly after dipping in the pool, I noticed a large, unusually shaped white luminous come from over the mountain range to the West/Northwest of the Las Vegas strip (I believe the Spring Mountain Range?).  There is not one thing I can think of to describe the shape, except that it was a cluster of some sorts, with a rod coming down from it.  My initial skeptical reaction was that it was balloons, but: at that distance, and it’s size, it could not be balloons, and at that point is was easy enough to see detail that it definitely was not balloons.  Plus it emitted a bright, glowing light. I was pointing it out to my wife, and other people around us began to notice and talk about it as well.   The object got higher in the sky, then started moving south along the mountain range (towards the flight path of McCarren Airport).   Then, another object came over the range.  This object, was smaller, and appeared to be a single oval shape.  It was the same white color, and also emitted the sam! e bright white light. Over the next hour or so, we watched the objects as they moved to the south/southwest.  They were definitely moving in tandem, and sometimes swap positions (left/right), but they always were fairly far apart.   It was around 11:00 am when I saw the two lights for the last time.  They were quite faint, far & at a high altitude.  One was straight to the south, and one was southwest they were very far apart at this point. Here are some other notes:   -Right after the second object came into view, the area they were would have been directly in the flight path for departures/arrivals at McCarren Airport. I noticed that during that time period, no planes took off or landed from that direction. If possible, can you attain air traffic control recording, chatter from that day? Whatever the objects were, they had to have been talking about it, because the control tower would have had clear view of the objects the whole time. -Also, there were approximately 10 helicopters the roared overhead (LV strip/Grand Canyon tours) during the time period where the sighting took place. Pilots & tourists had to have seen it. -Reason for waiting to report after a month: I thought for sure someone else, perhaps an aviation professional would have made a report by now. I’ve been checking this site and others like it daily since this sighting happened hoping to see something but to no avail. I am still disturbed at how blatant these craft were above a major city, one of the busiest airports in the US, and the fact that they came from the general direction of Area 51 & the Nevada Test Site. -I’d be happy to answer any questions an investigator may have. -I can draw a picture of the objects and/or a diagram of the timeline of the movement of them upon request.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
2 bright colored, fire like, teardrop shaped beings in the sky.;2011-08-19 20:30:00;8 Minutes;2 bright colored, fire like, teardrop shaped beings in the sky. STATEMENT OF UFO SIGHTING  I was driving home on August 19, 2011, and turning off of the highway at US 95 North at Fort Apache - Horse Drive at approximately 8:30 pm.  This location is situated in North-West Las Vegas, Nevada. As I was approaching Horse Drive, I noticed two very distinctive bright orange colored lights in the sky.  At first I thought they may be special street lights, because they are doing construction work in the area.  As I got closer, driving down Horse Drive, it suddenly became clear that they were not street lights. I continued driving down Horse Drive, glaring at these lights and when I was sure of what I saw, I stopped to observe.  There was a maroon colored van, which had apparently been observing the two lights as well. The two lights were like fire and shaped like a tear drop or a clove.  The sky was dark (just beyond dusk), stars were visible.  The objects were identical.  The color was pinkish-orange at the bottom, yellowish-orange in the middle, and yellow at the top.  They were very bright.  It was just like fire and they were hovering and behaving like the movement of fire.  They appeared to be much larger than the stars, yet about 1/3 size of a regular full moon.  They were a good distinctive distance between each other, but they were clearly identical in shape and size. As I was observing these two beings, one of them shot away over and behind the western mountains.  The maroon colored van made a U-turn and drove back up Horse Drive.  The speed of the shooting being was a little slower than lightening speed, but very, very fast.  The remaining one just hovered.  As I began to move down the street a little further, the being moved parallel to me.  I proceeded to turn in on my street and I could still see it.  I stopped the car again just before turning into my garage and the being just sat there.  I pulled into my garage and closed the door.  I grabbed my digital camera and went back outside to take pictures, but it was gone. I called the police to report it and they gave me your number. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sober-minded and sincere.  We suspect that she was an excellent witness.

Unknown crafts shadow passenger jet.;2013-12-17 17:00:00;10 minutes;Unknown crafts shadow passenger jet We were traveling on a Southwest flight to Los Angles when is the general area of Las Vegas, my husband notices 3 teardrop shaped crafts that appeared to be following the plane on the North side.   The leading craft had 2 huge lights on it and it looked as though there was a faint light between each craft as if they were tethered together.  It was very odd to say the least.   We watched it for about 10 minutes before it simply vanished.  It was not a reflection, as it was obscured twice by clouds;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
