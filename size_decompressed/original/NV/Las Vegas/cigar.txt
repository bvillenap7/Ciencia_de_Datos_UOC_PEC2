not been noted on any sighting that i have heard of.;1978-11-15 20:00:00;10 min;not been noted on any sighting that i have heard of. In November 1978 while i was moving with my family my father jokingly told me to come here.  We were draining the septic tank on our trailer.  So I went the the end of it and saw what appeared to be a long cylindrical shaped object in the air. Being the all knowing 9-yr old i said it was a low flying aircraft.   He said with out a sound?  I said it was just to far away to hear it.  He just laughed.  While in Vegas the next morning he showed ma a article from local paper that said there was 1500 reports of a mysterious sighting in the desert the night before.   To date i have not seen a thing on this.   is there a way to look this up? ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  Witness could access newspapers from that area, for that date.  PD));36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

I was walking my dog on a clear dark night where I live on the north west side of Las Vegas. I happen to look up and I saw a large long massive cigar shaped object. This was not a plane and larger than a 747. There was no noise. Both ends of the craft appeared to be tapered or blunted. No lights and the altitude of the craft was approximately 4000 to 7000 feet. It wasn't a bright metallic object but a metallic flat color. Possibly a dull greenish color. All of a sudden this object took off slightly to the north or north east at a tremendous speed when it must of realized that I got a fast good look at it. The speed for an object this large was initially moving very slow for its size and weight. I would say less than 90 knots! It was just crusin at the time. When I visited the little Alein Bar near Rachael, Nv., I saw a picture of the the craft on the wall. I then knew I wasn't seeing things.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
White, vertical cigar shape floating around in the eastern sky.;1998-10-10 17:30:00;10 minutes;White, vertical cigar shape floating around in the eastern sky. From the jacuzzi at the MGM Grand pool area, myself and 12 other friends all saw a small white-ish vertical cigar shape in the eastern sky, looking over the roof of the convention center. It looked to be at least 2 miles away, at approximately 55 degrees altitude from our posiion. My first thought was that it must be an elongated weather balloon, but it changed shape in weird fashion. It went from being clearly defined, to very blurry, as if it were vibrating violently. It also lengthened and shortened slightly. It appeared only to move slightly left (north) then right (south) a few times before moving off south and east, moving out of our view behind the building. What amazed me was that all the people I was with looked up at it after I spotted it, then looked away as if they had seen nothing at all. But here was this clearly unexplainble thing floating in the sky!! It reminded me of that footage from Florida of the floating metallic cylinder over the water...;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Object  seen 2/13/2007;2008-02-13 20:30:00;5-6 mins;Object  seen 2/13/2007 Hello,  As I was arriving home last night I happened to see something strange. The following is how it was seen. While unloading my shopping bags, I heard a helicopter in the distance. After a few moments it was within view. The only thing obstructing my view was the roof of my house. The helicopter then cleared the roof and continued moving southeast. At this moment in time,I was returning for my second trip to the car for the last of shopping bags. The noise of the helicopter was loud enough, to make me look again. I looked towards the helicopter and spotted another flying object near the helicopter. There was no noise from it, as far as I could tell. The helicopter continued moving southeast until another object appeared about 200 yards ahead. I say appeared because I did not actually see the craft arrive at that point. I was still focused on the first object the second craft fell into my view as the helicopter moved into the space. At this moment my wife was also starring at this strange sight. She said she was wondering what had grabbed my attention.I explained to her what I had seen so far. My daughter then came outside where my wife told her to look towards the sky. Craft 1 started to pulse from a dull yellow to a color of that from a BMW headlight, a bluish-purple.Within a few seconds Craft 1 left at an unknown speed heading north. This is the last I saw from Craft 1. While Craft 1 left the helicopter was still heading souteast and Craft 2 was now about 100 yards away. At this point I believe the pilot saw this object. The helicopter quickly, sharply turned due east towards Sunrise Mtn. The Craft hovered for a moment while the helicopter continued moving.The Craft then got in front of the helicopter, again baout 100 yards. I did not see the craft move as I can describe it is more of a blink and then it was there. At this moment I was aking both my daughter and wife if they were seeing what I was seeing. The helicopter quickly and I stress quickly turned head directly south. I saw the tail of the helicopter whip around and a higher exhaust note from it. The helicopter continued moving south with its nose down,tail high moving fast. The craft at this point moved along the side of the helicopter still 100 yards away. This mirror image of the craft and halicopter lasted about 10-15 seconds. The next thing that occured was that the craft stopped and redirected towards the north. It moved slowly at first and zoomed away. The craft were long about the same size as the helicopter. The pulse affect of the craft was as that of a squid when it is under stress. The speed was awe inspiring. There was no known sound if any coming from the craft. The helicopter was not a police or military aircfart,it seemed to be a medical helicopter.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

((HOAX)) Luminescent cigar shaped unidentified flying object seen flying low over Las Vegas in daytime followed by mil. helicopters.;2012-06-27 10:00:00;15 minutes;Luminescent cigar shaped unidentified flying object seen flying low over Las Vegas in daytime followed by military helicopters. Cigar shape craft no wings flying horizontally over W. Sahara Blvd. in broad daylight.  I stopped my car to watch it pass over our store and received some light skin burns to the left side of my face and lips.  It was pulsing with a bright white light in the center of the ship flying very low maybe only 75 ft above our building.  Suddenly 3 military helicopters appeared over our building dropped down right out of the sky in hot pursuit of the object which sped on towards NE Las Vegas and disappeared on the horizon.  Migs were observed scrambling overhead.  The same thing was observed by a friend of mine also proceeding down Sahara Blvd to work.  I am a college professor and he is a military officer and both of us saw the same thing.  When I asked him what he thought. he said, &quot That object the helicopters were following was not from this world&quot .  He is very aware what sort of flying vehicles the military has and I am in agreement. This occurred on June 27th 10am in las Vegas, nv at Sahara and Jones avenues . ((NUFORC Note:  We originally posted this report, but in error.  There are no MiGs in Las Vegas.  PD));36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
High flying object, trails in front and back, elongated, bright shape in the middle.;2013-10-02 14:15:00;10 minutes;High flying object, trails in front and back, elongated, bright shape in the middle. October 2nd, 2013, between 2:11-2:30 pm, Las Vegas, NV   While dismissing from school, we noticed this strange light.  In fact, we thought it was a single strand of spider web caught on the tether ball pole in the breeze.   Then, we notice that it was high in the sky.  It had puffs of vapor in the front and back of the main source of light.  Those puffs looked like condensation or thick spots on a spider web.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

I saw something in the dark sky that caught my eye.  It looked like a long line of lights all flying at the same speed and altitude.   Since it was night, I couldn't tell if if was one UFO or a string of them all at same altitude and speed.   I quickly pointed it out to him and he was able to see them in a fleeting moment and then it vanished. We both saw a very long line of lights that was visual only for 10-20 seconds in Las Vegas.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
