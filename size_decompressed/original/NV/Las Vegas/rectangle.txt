large, erratic, black object, movement reminiscent of paper falling, almost invisible edge on.;1997-04-08 20:00:00;15 sec;Summary : large, erratic, black object, movement reminiscent of paper falling, almost invisible edge on. Hmmmm- perhaps you can help clear up an incident that has been nagging at me.  I was attending the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas starting 4/5/97- I believe it was Tuesday the 8th, about 8pm, I looked out the window of the Flamingo Hilton and saw what looked to like a dark piece of paper caught in an updraft. It shifted erratically in a descending pattern and at times almost disappeared from view when it was on edge. As the object moved lower and it became framed by the backdrop of mountains I came to the conclusion that it was much farther away than I had initially thought and well outside of the city.  I tried to reassess the scale of the object, but found it difficult. At a guess I would say the object was 15 or more miles from the city and looked like a windblown piece of construction paper at 100 feet. The scale of horizontal and vertical shifts in trajectory also took on the appearance of a much greater distance and considerable implied ! speed. The object dissappeared from view perhaps 10-15 seconds after initial siting. Perhaps 2 or 3 minutes later 2 sets of dual vapor trails emmerged along the horizon and as they reached the point where the object appeared to have descended the planes (these were obviously planes and what looked to be military planes) forked out in opposite directions. I mentioned it to a couple of colleagues in the airport the next day on the return to Seattle, a woman in line overheard me and suggested that it could have been a Stealth aircraft. Could be- my impression was that if it was a plane  it was only a piece of it- perhaps a wing. I am not convinced that I saw a flying saucer. But by any definition it was an unidentified flying/airborn object that evoked a military response. Do you have any other reports of objects seen or military maneuvers in that locality at that time?;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Vivid UFO craft siting.;2010-07-10 02:00:00;1 minutes;Vivid UFO craft siting My friend and I were walking up the road being hoodlums at 2 am when I noticed a what looked like a shooting star in the atmosphere so I tapped my friends arm so she wouldn't miss it and immediately the bright light stopped.   The UFO then came hovering directly towards and stopped above 100 feet above us as if it saw us spot it.  It was a purple rectangle with two side by side circle white lights on the bottom.  It sat there for about 5 seconds then flew away in a zig zag line emanating purple and green glitter looking material off of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

It would then stop for a minute or two at a time and stay stationary, then move again.  It was partly cloudy and it appeared that sometimes it would maneuver to get into or more clear area of the sky.  In its maneuvers to re-position, it would move in very short, extremely fast speeds. This having appeared so to me, at its seemingly high altitude the speed there must have been tremendously fast.  I watched for approximately an hour, after which it became faint and I could not see it anymore;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
A brown box craft located north of Las Vegas.;2012-01-30 12:00:00;2 mins;A brown box craft located north of Las Vegas. A brown box craft was located North of Las Vegas at around 12.30 pm.  It looked controlled, and then it defied aerodynamics.  No wind today.  I was walking, and then didn't see since it went below the horizon and I couldn't see it anymore.  It was definitely weird.  I never saw anything like this in my life.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Feb 1st 2012  10:41 am  sighting of  large  tan/ beige triangler craft flying fast out over the eastern direction of Las Vegas NV;2012-02-01 10:42:00;3 MIN;Feb 1st 2012  10:41 am  sighting of  large  tan/ beige triangler craft flying fast out over the eastern direction of Las Vegas NV On February 1st at 10:41am I observered one large tan or beige triangular craft flying at an average altitude coming from the north and then headed east over the Las Vegas Nevada sky.  I thought it could be maybe a B2 bomber coming out from Nellis AFB.  At the same time I had just placed an order for an early meal at a Taco Bell waiting at the drive thru facing north.  I asked the counter person if they could see the object in the sky to confirm my viewing of the object in the sky.  The counter person also confirmed seeing the strange object in flight.  Asking me what was it?   What I saw was an unusual tan color and shape flying object that almost changed into a rectangular form as it flew away into the eastern direction.  Living very close by I drove home went to get my camera and the object was out of view when I returned outside.  It was about a 4-6 minutes in total view.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

There were 9-11 rectangular shaped lights shaped in rows like a chimney, and one pointing in the top and the bottom.  I ran inside to get my husband, he saw them too and they changed into different sizes and shapes.  They looked like they were making constellation forms for a time.  They proceeded to disappear one by one, I asked my husband if he saw it and he said yes, although he couldn't explain it.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Red-white-and-blue object hovering over east side of Las Vegas.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a star or Venus??  PD));2017-05-31 05:00:00;1 hour+;Red-white-and-blue object hovering over east side of Las Vegas. I noticed a light in the eastern sky while driving home, so I parked and started to watch it with binoculars and the night vision app on my phone.  It was clearly neither a plane nor a helicopter, due to the way it hovered without circling like helicopters do.  It just hovered a ways up in the sky, but I could not tell what exactly it was over, couldn't see that far.  Very gradually it began to rise eventually, very slowly.   When I looked through the binoculars, it looked like a cylindrical or rectangle shape with red, white and blue light, in bands.  Very bright.   When I looked through the night vision it appeared to be a cube and appeared to be rotating rapidly!  Completely different without night vision, as then it appeared stationary.   The dawn was breaking and it kept rising in the sky, but very slowly, straight up.  I kept watching until it finally couldn't be seen anymore due to a cloud it went into, about an hour all told.

I heard a loud humming noise, and looked out my window and saw red lights flashing in the sky. About 300' to 500' above my RV rectangular shaped mass with red lights slowly floated by.I went outside the RV to watch it float by. I thought this might be a blimp but no blimp above the rectangle of red lights. I ran back into the RV to get my phone for a video. I shot two videos of the lights. The first also has the humming vibration in the audio. The humming noise did not match any airborne craft, plane, or helicopter I had ever heard. Plus it drifted very slowly. it was amazing how slow it could go and still stay elevated. I watched it as it floated towards the lights of Las Vegas along inter state 15 South. As it grew smaller 2 white lights which sounded like fighter jets went/chased in the same direction as the red flashing rectangle.Approx 8:55pm on 10/23/19;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
