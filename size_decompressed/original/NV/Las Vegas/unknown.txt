Loss of time, and white to blue cloud.;1979-06-23 00:00:00;unknown;Loss of time, and White to Blue Cloud. Myself and my girlfriend had just picked up my best friend and his new girlfriend who had just gotten back to town, so we all took a drive up to the mountains and as we made the first turn we ended up at the highway at the other end of what is an hour and a half drive depending on your speed and we were just out for the drive, none of us heard any sound or saw anything in the night sky, our drive just began and ended, we did meet with someone who we thought was a serious ufo investigator but he gut took all our information and books we had on ufos and just vanished. There was also an incident in 1985 when I lived in Nevada and 20 miles from the Nevada Test Site, ha, ha  it's not there (right), anyway myself and my girlfriend were taking a late night walk down the towns main road I noticed a white cloud above the desert roadway witch had a bright search light like a helicopter looking for something, then the light went out after about 20 minutes of flashing around inside the cloud, then the cloud turned a bright blue and slowly faded away into nothing and the night sky was again clear. Weather this is interesting to you or not I felt I just had to say what I expirenced,  thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD));36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
1981 strange gyrating lights in desert outside Las vegas;1981-06-15 22:30:00;90 min;1981 strange gyrating lights in desert outside Las vegas In june of 1981 my parents and I where visiting my brother.He Knew that I would enjoy going out into the desert to see really dark skies with lots of stars since I was and still am an amature astonomer. looking at the sky the stars were brilliant. Several miles off in the distance on the horizon I noticed somthing was moving, I wasnt sure but there was a mountain that I could use as a refrence point. A light was moving up, down and sidways. When it would get close to the ground, it looked like lightning or electricity was being discharged from it, then it would shoot up in the air a good distance and start gyrating around like an angry bee, great big loops and zigzags. We all watched for over an hour as it just did the same thing over and over,then got back in our motorhome and went back too Henderson where my brother lived. I cant say for sure where I was at, I wasnt familiar with the area. But I was looking into the Northern sky, and we were to the East of Las Vegas.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Moon appears to split in half;1987-06-01 06:45:00;00:15;Moon appears to split in half I doubt that what I saw was a UFO, but it still rates as one of the oddest events I have ever witnessed.  My roommate and I were on my our to work one morning.  I can only estimate that it was in the mid to late 1980's since this happened so long ago.  There was a full moon setting as the sun was rising.  While stopped at a red light I commented to my roommate that the moon appeared to have a crack cut out in the bottom of the moon.  Since the moon was nearing the horizon, I assumed that the visual appearance was caused by a telephone pole or something that we could not see.  After the street light turned green we continued on our way and I really did not think about it untill a couple of minutes later I glanced over and saw that the crack was still there, only bigger now, about 1/4 across the diameter of the moon.  This time I was driving and the horizon was moving along but the notch remained.  We kept watching as we were driving and could see the crack growing.  We really did not know what was happening and thought the moon was splitting in two before our very eyes.  We pulled over in a spot where we had a good view and watched to see what was happening.  (We figured if the moon was really breaking up, why bother going to work because we were probably all going to die?)  We watched as the crack literally went all the way to the top of the moon and gave the appearance of a moon spit into two halves!  We sat waiting for the earth to be destroyed or something, but then the crack drifted to the right of the moon and off of the surface entirely after about 10 minutes.  When we got to work and explained why we were late, everyone thought we were crazy of course except for one other guy who also saw the event.  I called the newspaper and TV stations but they thought I was crazy too.  The only explanation I can imagine is that somewhere on the earths surface, a rocket was being launched into space and the exhaust trail cast a shadow on the moon.  Is this possible?  Or do you have any other similar repor! ts as th is in your database?  I know the moon did not split in half that day, but I am not making up what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Close encounter at home;1988-08-30 06:00:00;90-120 seconds;Close encounter at home   This report is intended to detail an extremely unusual occurrence that I have kept to myself for more than 23 years, partly because of its incredibly odd and unique nature, and partly because I haven't known what to do with the information. After hearing Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast AM this evening (Tu., 10/25/2011) urging witnesses to document their experiences, I decided to pull into the nearest late-night restaurant with a WiFi hookup and finally write this down. This is not a report of a sighting (I will submit another report for one of several I've had over a 40-year period), but rather of what I firmly believe to have been an alien presence in my home. It was breaking dawn on a Sunday morning at the end of August, 1988, about 6:00 a.m. when I found myself waking from a very sound sleep to hear my wife, who was sleeping next to me, speaking in a very high-speed whisper.  And then I heard the response from another individual, also whispering faster than anything I'd ever heard like it in my life. I suspect it was the sound of these two that woke me, but the experience of HOW I woke up was unique as well.  First, I was more clear-headed than usual compared to how I typically awaken.  Second, it was as if by instinct that I came awake without either opening my eyes or moving any other part of my body--as if subconsciously I had been preparing for just such an opportunity to observe as the one I found myself in at that point.  But I have no recollection of actually planning any such thing, only that when the moment presented itself, I played dead and listened. The speed of the back-and-forth whispering was such that I could not make out a single word being said.  It was as if two individuals were trying to mimic the sounds made by an old fashioned radio dial being turned back and forth as it nears a station signal kind of a swishing and swirling of sounds, only being peppered in whispers at machine-gun velocity. I listened intently as this went on for about one and a half to two minutes.  I noticed that there was no emotion, no sense of urgency, as might be expected when someone speaks much faster than usual.  Instead it was more like machine efficiency--a personal characteristic that I would never ascribe to my wife.  It struck me that information (it impressed me as being more like raw data) was being exchanged very quickly, like between two computers, as opposed to a conversation taking place. Then it suddenly stopped.  I have no way to back this up, but it felt like I had been caught eavesdropping (when I was supposed to be asleep), which brought this bizarre exchange to an abrupt halt. I don't know why, but instinct seemed to kick in immediately, telling me to pretend like I had just started to wake up.  So I did. The second I began moving, my eyes still closed, I heard the sound of little feet running from my wife's side of the bed, out the door of our bedroom, then fading down the hall.  It was unnaturally fast, lasting less than two seconds from start to finish. At that point I gently shook my wife's shoulder.  It took a moment for her to emerge from a very deep sleep. She remembered nothing of the encounter. I did not dream this.  I was wide awake and alert, and did not go back to sleep once it ended. The situation never repeated.  And I'd never heard of anyone having a similar experience until one night recently on C2C-AM, when George Noory took an open-line call from a man whose experience closely aligned with mine.  But the caller had barely gotten out the gist of his story when Noory had to cut to a commercial, and he made no comment on it afterward.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Saw thick blue beam of light come down out of the sky accross a field and then back up again.;1995-12-14 21:40:00;Couple of Seconds;Saw thick blue beam of light come down out of the sky accross a field and then back up again. My friend and I were driving along Highway 40 at mile marker 264.  This was somewhere around Arizona or New Mexico.   We saw a very large blue beam come down out of the sky.  This could very well have been a helicopter with a large blue spotlight but it wouldn't make sense out in the middle of nowhere.  This all happened so fast also.   The mannerism seemed as if it could have been a helicopter but it was really fast.  It just went accross in a straight line.  It was on the north side of Highway 40.  We couldn't see a craft or the source of the light.   I know it has been almost 10 years since the incident but I just found the page in the notebook where my friend and I documented the incident.  I wanted to report in here before I threw it out in case maybe someone else saw the same thing.  Everyone on the highway had to have seen it.

A bright Flash of something in the sky leaving a long trail lasting approx. 60 secs. and a long greenish hume to the tail.;1998-11-16 04:45:00;60 secs;A bright Flash of something in the sky leaving a long trail lasting approx. 60 secs. and a long greenish hume to the tail. I was on my way to work this mornig, 11-16-98  at about 0445 ( I was almost to work and had to start at 0500) when I noticed a bright flash that had seemed to illuminate the entire area.  This is what got my attention. the sun was starting to bring some light to the sky but had not come up over the maountain yet.  I the caught from the corner of my eye. a streaking object appeared to be ball in shape, and leaving a long tail behind it about 2-3 miles long. this tail and the object had a slight greenish hume to it  the trail was very wide, wider than any meteor i've ever seen. But I'm not an expert.  The trail continued and the at about 2-3 miles it stopped leaving a trail. the ball object had disappeared and the trail remained for approxiamtely 45-60 secs. The direction of travel for the object was southwest away from the rising sun. I've never seen anything i would consider UFO in Nature and I am very skeptical of it being one but I thought I could at least give you a heads up if this was some thing.   Could this have been a prelude meteor  for the up coming meteor shower?  Thank you for Your time. (Name deleted));36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Bright light shining directionally out of a cloudy shape or object, got bright and smoky and then disappered.;1998-12-05 20:30:00;10 seconds;Bright light shining directionally out of a cloudy shape or object, got bright and smoky and then disappered. It was well after sunset and I went to the window of my hotel room to see the lights of the city and I saw what I first thought to be a helicopter shining a searchlight. As I watched it I realized I could not really see and object but a very bright light shining out of a smoky or hazy shape, moving west to east, light pointed to the north, not at the ground but horizontally to the north. It was almost as if a door or hatch was opened and a bright light inside was shininh out of the opening. It seemed to be emminating from a small cloud (sky was clear) or just a patch of haze. The was smoke billowing all around it which was illuminted by the shining light. THe light then got brighter and the whole area just disappeared leaving a clear sky, no smoke, no haze no cloud ,,,nothing, it was just gone, I had the sensation that it had collapsed into itself;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

While on my way to my other job at one of the hotels driving north bound on I-215 I happened to look in the direction of the Las Vegas Stripand I saw what appeared to be a formation of about 10 lights in an oval shape floating in the vicinity of Mt. Charleston.  No strobe was apparent on the formation and there was other air trafic in the area.  These lights were of a yellow -orange color and faded with in intensity from time to time.  They also did not mantain their original shape, becoming a triangle at times and returning to their original circular shape.  I tried to keep them in sight while I drove but by the time I arrived at my destination they had disappeared or were obscured by objects in the distance.  They were over the North western part of the city and my prespective was fron the southeast heading north.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

No one was looking in my area so I was not going to say anything but then an Iron worker from a boom lift said Did any of you guys see that ?, I said yes and was relieved that someone other than myself saw it. Completely silent about 400 feet above me. He said What the hell was that ? I said I don't know. He said it was a BUO Blue unidentified object ? I said and he said no Big unidentified object.

Witnesses were not together at time of sighting, 4 different pairs and two individuals had same type of experiance on different nights. Appears to be huge and rather in high orbit as you can see the commercial air traffic flying substantially lower than it over the mountains.  Object does not move, it appears stationary. Object is not seen flying away, it simply vanishes after 1 hour or more. No reporting on local news, however many people are actively watching this, nightly. One night I was observing it there was a plane out of Nellis AFB that headed straight for the object in an unusual flight path for them. As it approached the object it vanished.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

6 distant lights in v-shaped form flying very slowly seen over  Las Vegas Blvd, Nevada then fading as it passed overhead.;2003-05-18 23:15:00;4 min;6 distant lights in v-shaped form flying very slowly seen over  Las Vegas Blvd, Nevada then fading as it passed overhead. We were watching the fountain show at the grounds of Bellagio Hotel along Las Vegas Blvd. when we noticed a distant group of lights in the night sky about 10:00 high from the southwest which seems to be just floating up there. We realized later that it was actually moving at a very slow speed, much slower than the planes that were flying that night. It moved from the southwest to the northeast direction passing overhead us. The v-hsaped lights has its pointed part pointing to the east while moving at very slow speed. It took about 4 minutes to pass us overhead. As it was moving, the object was rotating very slowly, too. It completely rotated 180 degrees during the course of its flight such that it's v-point was now pointing west after it passed overhead. All the time, it never changed it's northeasterly direction. After passing overhead, it's speed gradually decrease and it's lights began to grow dimmer and dimmer like it was going away from us or moving up. There were no clouds that night and it was not like the clouds were covering it making it's lights to fade. It took about 2 minutes for the lights to completely fade out. When we reviewed the video I took of it we counted about 6 lights total making the v-shaped object. Other people who was there watching the fountain show were able to see the object we were looking at. During the length of observation, there were no sounds heard that would point to the object as the source. There were planes flyng that night before, during and after the sighting. The lights are of one color which is white. The course of flight was straight and constant.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

When I tried to locate it is when it hit me it wasn't something you could pinpoint it seemed to engulf the area it was massive, like standing on a runway just as a B-52 flew an inch over your head before touching down. When it stopped is when we noticed our dogs barking and the people next door in thier yard and right then is when a couple of huge Helicopters flew over headed west. Every since that night my Wife and I have heard these Helicopters almost daily and I've finally found out that they're Blackhawks from Nellis And have watched them fly radials in certain areas for 30 minutes over our part of town before increasing then heading west.

I looked up and saw nothing the first time, and the secind time I looked even harder, trying to trace the noise with my eyes, but I couldn't see anyhting.  I spent time after the incident looking for anything in the area that might make a noise like that and found nothing.

See you later: appears to leave the Earth!;2007-06-04 00:30:00;2-3 seconds;See you later: appears to leave the Earth! I was living near the intersection of Washington and Rancho in Las Vegas, NV. I only lived there for about 2.5 months. I was renting a room in a house. I did not have a car, but I bought a bus pass to get around.  On many nights, I would leave around the same time, and take a walk to a local 7-11 store to get a soda or candy bar. It was a good half mile to mile walk. I occasionally would glance to the sky and look at the stars on my walks. One evening, I did just that, but this time was different. I noticed a real bright star that stood out from the other stars.  I was walking South towards Washington Street, but my head was facing to the West while walking (Rancho street), toward this object in the sky. I was looking at it for about 5 or so seconds, and all of a sudden it zipped at a 75-80 degrees using an acute angle. When I say zipped, I mean it appeared to leave the Earth within a few seconds (blink of an eye). I am not good with angles: so I will say it zipped nearly straight up.  It was too far away to describe what kind of object it was. I did notice a light trail that was whitish/blue that it left behind. This trail dissapeared within a few seconds as well, but gave me a good idea of its path. It was clear that this object (physical or non-physical) had unreal speed.  This incident proves to me there is either something else out there in this universe, or man has developed something amazing. I surely side to the former.

It was very windy and the sky was completely overcast with low clouds.  As I drove nearer it was apparent the lights, which looked like white globes, were either stationary or moving very slowly above the highway, and they appeared to move apart as I closed with them.  As I passed beneath them, 6 very dim white lights became visible four in a diamond shape between the globes (closer to the right globe than the left) and then two placed equally distant trailing west.  Unlike the two bright lights, the light from the smaller six looked indirectly lit, like distant windows appear in the nighttime.  The lights were then blocked from view as we passed beneath them.  My wife was with me but was not in the least interested and paid no attention to either me or the lights. Also, on the drive back to Tecopa I was astonished to find my night vision was restored--the halos I'd become used to seeing around oncoming headlights were gone and I could actually see the road ahead as headlights passed. It only lasted a week or so, but man was that a great thing.  I don't know for sure that it was associated with whatever it was I saw in the sky, but I do know that my vision immediately after I saw the lights was a whole lot better than before. I can submit a sketch of the lights' configuration on request, IF I can figure out how to load it into this computer.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Shooting Star Slows, Turns, and Spirals Inward;2008-09-25 20:30:00;5 seconds;Shooting Star Slows, Turns, and Spirals Inward I was stargazing shortly after dusk when I saw a shooting star in the NE sky.  This appeared normal -- except I saw a lot of detail... a bright white light at the head with a green tail, headed East  Moments later, from the same general area where the first object faded, I saw what I thought was a slightly less bright red-tinted shooting star, heading towards the northwest.  This is when things got odd.  This second object slowed down almost to a crawl (still moving smoothly like a shooting star).  Never coming to a complete stop, it turned hard right, accelerated, and made a circle, spiraling inside the circle towards its center before disappearing. Do 'shooting stars' do loops??  Seconds afterwards, as I was attempting to begin to describe what I saw to my wife, two USAF fighter jets flew in a path that took them directly over my neighborhood, and  at a much lower flight level than I've ever seen out here. FYI I am on the far northern end of the valley.  To my East is Nellis AFB.  To my NW is the bombing range.  However these planes sure must have been in a hurry to have been flying so low. Afterwards, there was one more green colored normal shooting star which my wife did see, and a strange plane which was also flying fairly low but without sound.  It headed over the mountain to my North and then down the spine and over the mountains.  I have seen objects that look like stars initially seem to land behind this mountain on several occasions, but I have never seen a shooting star do a loopty-loop.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Jets take off toward the north then orange lights glow in succession repeatedly.;2009-04-23 21:00:00;5 minutes;Jets take off toward the north then orange lights glow in succession repeatedly. While sitting on the balcony of my apartment We saw and heard 2 jets take off from Nellis Air Force Base( less than a mile from my home)The jets shot off towards the north mountain range and were gone. A few seconds later my wife and I were looking to see the jets and saw 2 bright orange circular lights flash on then off, then one on then off slowly, then the other on, then off slowly. We watched to see if we could see what it was and quite a ways to the left saw another orange light, same type, turn on then slowly off, then next to it another on, then slowly off, then again, and one more time, then they were gone. The second time there were 4 in a row. We then saw what appeared to be the jets circling as if the were searching for  the lights. Two or three jets appeared to be circling in the distance above the northern mountains of the las vegas valley.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Object with no contrails, fly erratically over Las Vegas Valley.;2010-05-30 13:45:00;30 mins;Object with no contrails, fly erratically over Las Vegas Valley This is the second time I have seen an object over the Las Vegas Valley. I observered the same type of object about one month ago.  I am a former Police Officer. During todays occurance I was sitting on the Southern back deck of where I live with a clear view of the Southern sky above about 45 degress from ground to sky.   I observed a white object moving at slow but consistant pace toward the west at an unknown altitude and it seemed to flow the basic flight path of flights leaving from McCarren Airport.  However its pace was a lot slower than the planes that I could clearly see leaving the area.  The object changed direction at a full ninety degree turn and proceeded north.  That's when I took notice of it really. I watched it come toward the north, stop and then go west and then came to complete stop for about five minutes.  I used a Telephone pole as a guide of movement.  It then darted south and stopped. Another white object streaked throught the sky a little way west from the stationary object.  That object stayed there until I came inside to find somewhere to report it.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Las Vegas UFO Sighting 3.31.2011;2011-03-31 15:30:00;15 min;Las Vegas UFO Sighting 3.31.2011 03.31.2011	South West Las Vegas, NV  approximately 3:30pm	(sunny clear skies)   Yesterday I was enjoying the day in my backyard talking on the phone, when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.  A huge dark thing was floating sideways and up into the air.  I told the person on the phone, “oh that’s odd, kinda’ looks like a metallic balloon has been let go into the sky by someone.  And it did look like that, a grey/black sorta’ metallic looking with an occasional extremely bright light omitting periodically. Rationalizing that it is a balloon I let my attention stray. A few minutes pass and I look to the sky to see the progress of flight. To my surprise, the “balloon” is not where I thought it would be. In fact, it appears to be stationary and not as high as expected. Now it has my full attention. I watch as the dark mass with the bright light glided horizontally towards the North West of the valley. Watching in disbelief and curiosity, after a few minutes, I witness it angle and then turn back towards the SW, towards me. I am now talking to my mom on the phone (trying to direct her view to see what I am seeing), the unidentified flying object is now heading directly towards me. I am sure it was just my perception, but the object was flying then stopped, what seem to be directly over me and then began to hover. A full minute passed and I noticed the bright light was still as intense but the dark matter was dissipating. I realized the craft was now starting to ascend. Several moments passed as it continued to hover and rise. Then it slowly drifted towards the North East. My experience was over. I always believed, just too much credible information not to, I just never thought I would get the opportunity to experience such an anomaly with my own two eyes. I am not looking for validation, I am just sharing my experience. Thank you for your forum to share these stories, you allow us to truly be “not alone”.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
I saw something flame and fall from the sky. It was either a Meteor, space junk, or an airplane.;2011-04-30 20:22:00;4-6 seconds;Place:  Las Vegas, NV (Summerlin)   Date - Saturday, April 30, 2011   Time:  8:22 PM (20:22)   Description - I was in my automobile at the intersection of Smoke Ranch Road and Buffalo Boulevard looking due East across the Las Vegas Valley in the direction of Frenchmen and Sunrise Mountains (Nellis Air Base).   I saw something flame and fall from the sky.  It was either a Meteor, space junk, or an airplane. I caught only 4-6 seconds of it.  It trailed flames, then a flare-out and quick drop.  It was difficult to tell distance.  If it was a Meteor or space junk it could have been far away.  If it was an airplane it could have been 10’s of miles away.

Low Humming and HUGE Object over Las Vegas West Valley.  ((NUFORC Note:  Confirmed…sighting of a blimp.  PD));2012-02-23 18:23:00;2 minutes;Low Humming and HUGE Object over Las Vegas West Valley I was in my backyard at 1823 when I heard a low hum (not a commercial aircraft engine type or helicopter) and looked towards the NW and saw a green light (like an aircraft on its right wing) approaching and I looked for the red element which would indicate the edge wing.  There were no landing lights or strobes on this flying object.  I call it an object because I am familiar with commercial aircraft and some of the common military aircraft which flies over and this was huge.  I waited about 30 seconds as it approached not quite overhead but a little off centered and that is when I saw a red element at it’s leading edge not on what would be the left side of the aircraft.  I wanted to see if it passed a star to be better able to see some shape on this but it did not pass any visible stars because of the time so I do not know what shape this was.   I ran to my front of my house to see if it continued towards the SE but lost sight of it.   It was running dark. I subsequently called the local channels KLASTV and Channel 13 describing the above and got the response this was the first reporting.   I got the impression they thought I was a prank call but I do not randomly call anyone just for the sake of taking someone else’s time unneccesarily. Because of how dark it was I do not think my cellphone could have captured anything because of the resolution and lighting.   All I can say is I saw a flying object and it was HUGE.  I live in the flight path of departing aircraft in LAS (Las Vegas) and watch commercial aircraft quite a bit and see at times the International space station pass over.   It is fun to see such a marvel. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Update to Earlier Report this evening This is a follow up to the contents below:  After I was contacted by an investigator last night and it was explained to me that what I saw was possibly a Blimp.  This is plausible although I do not live in North Las Vegas where the N Las Vegas Airport is and is known to have blimps there. I was asked to contact the FSS at Las Vegas and since I do not have a phone book at my home, I went on line and was given some phone numbers but it was not the FSS so after half an hour, I looked at the facts below and wrote this off as a blimp which makes sense.  I am satisfied with that because a that could explain why it was running dark and the light configuration was not your typical fixed winged aircraft and the low humming sound I heard. Believe me when I say I do not normally do this and was not looking to cause any problems. Thank you for responding so quickly. What I originally wrote: I was in my backyard at 1823 when I heard a low hum (not a commercial aircraft engine type or helicopter) and looked towards the NW and saw a green light (like an aircraft on its right wing) approaching and I looked for the red element which would indicate the edge wing.

10 objects, circular, deep orange color (see description).;2012-12-29 20:30:00;3 minutes;10 objects, circular, deep orange color (see description) I'm sure I was not the only one to see this. I was in public at the time ~ out running errands.   When I got to the shopping parking lot, these objects were in plain view.  There were about 10 of them - very bright, a deep orange/red color.  All in a straight line front to back, except for three of them (the middle ones) which were in a row / side by side.   The three side by side moved / swirled strangely and around each other.  They were moving all in succession heading from S/SE to the N/NW direction.   At first glance I thought maybe they were helicopters, but they were a deep orange/red color with no sound (not helicopters)!   After watching for about 1 minute or so, the ones in the middle began to fade out, then the ones toward the front, then the ones in the rear.   The leader of the lights stayed for another minute, then I stopped watching and went into the store.   There was nobody else in the store parking lot at that time, but surely hundreds of others saw these objects, whatever they were.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Didnt look Friendly thats all I can say.;2013-10-14 19:00:00;19:05;Didnt look Friendly thats all I can say. A couple of friends and I decided to go rock climbing up a mountain in south southern highlands to see the Las Vegas valley when the sun sets.  As we approach the mountaintop, I reach for my binoculars in my duffle bag and  started to glance  North at the Las Vegas strip, as the sun started to set to the West , My friends and I we're enjoying the view until one of my friends noticed a small blackish line miles away into  the horizon with his bare-naked eye . I started to view this object in my binoculars, I had NO IDEA what it was BUT I knew it was a UFO , I gave the binoculars to my friend to clarify what I was viewing, he couldnt believe his own eyes.  The Ufo wasn't your typicall Disc/sosser, spinning rotating thing hovering in the sky.  What I seen through with these binoculars as clear as day look like a very scary black battleship cruiser hovering a few hundred feet over empty desert.  It didnt look friendly at all, the UfO was very sleek smooth an round! on top but the botton was really rigid and pointy . it looked like a seahorse on its side and not upright.  It was just very out of thisworld.  I drew a picture of the ufo looks nothing humane but after we seen it for a few minutes through the binoculars.  It just slowly disappeared Into the sunet.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
UFO Captured Over North Las Vegas.;2014-04-16 20:20:00;5 minutes;UFO Captured Over North Las Vegas. Something that I initially thought was an airplane flew north going right past my house, but it wasn't making any noise and the red lights were a brilliant red and seemed larger than normal.  Within a couple of seconds it reversed direction for about a second or two right in its own path and then reversed again continuing on towards North Las Vegas and perhaps even Nellis Air Force Base.  That got me up and onto a raised cement slab near our fence so I could see better.  I was pretty pumped and shocked at the same time because it was clear right away that this was a UFO.  When you see it in 3D with your own eyes it looks much clearer and way easier to see than any video will show.  My adrenalin was definitely running. Anyway, I was fumbling around, trying to get my camera out of my pocket so I could try to film this thing.  By this time 45 seconds or more before has elapsed before I could start filming.  Being the novice I am, I used the screen on the phone camera to try and keep up with it.  I think that was a mistake because I kept losing the UFO, especially when it would dim in brightness.  I also zoomed in and out too much trying to see it better. I apologize for being so shaky but this might be a once in a lifetime event for me and I wanted proof. So anyway, the video speaks for itself and I welcome any comments or criticisms.  Whatever it was it was amazing!  I see a lot of aircraft living where I live including Air Force One when Obama comes to town but I have never seen something like this putting on a show like it did.  It also had to be moving pretty fast because it was at least 10 miles away and could be close to 20 miles away depending on where it was at times in the video. I also reported this to MUFON, case 55529.  I have already been contacted by the Regional Director (Nevada) for MUFON and told that it is being investigated.  The video I shot can be seen on YouTube at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ber6A4y2Fsc;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

It illuminated approximately 100 feet of airspace in a fan shape but could not see it lighting up the ground at all.  The object/light very slowly made its way over the western mountains and then we could tell it was still on, because the mountains become backlight in the dark of night.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Crossing moon, disappear, reappear, hover then takeoff  John Wilson UFO sighting and filming 3/18/2019 522pm Las Vegas, NV Sahara Blvd;2019-03-18 17:22:00;48 seconds;crossing moon, disappear, reappear, hover then takeoff  ((name of observer deleted)) UFO sighting and filming 3/18/2019 522pm Las Vegas, NV, Sahara Blvd between Ft. Apache and Durango,  The Lakes Business Park   So I was watching the moon and noticed hey the moon doesnt look right with this warping quality.  The moon appeared to be peeling and shimmering at the edges sort of like how hot blacktop distorts what you see with the heat convection, but in a way that made me uneasy.  So I thought hey maybe I should see if my camphone can capture what I was seeing.  I zoomed all the way in and aimed the camera and found a steady position and this took around 30 seconds to prepare.  Video quality was junk because my phone wasnt created for long distance zoom but I pressed record anyways.  The only object in the clear sky that I could see with my camera up to that point was the moon, but as soon as I pressed record, literally within milliseconds of activating the record function, this tiny white dot appeared traversing in front of the moon.  I held my steady position suddenly full of excitement that this could be a UFO.  I couldnt actually see it with my eyes but the camera picked it up fine.  This thing is obviously high altitude.  At first I thought it was a huge coincidence that I basically got ready to film a UFO without knowing it.  Sent me for a loop.  Distance was very difficult to determine but whatever it was it was definitely very high altitude.  Difficult to not think it was actually at the moon itself, but if it were at the moon it would need to be exceptionally bright and large to shine through the daytime blue sky. UFO?  Plane?  The ISS?   The recording is 48 seconds long.  The object approaches the moon from the right at around 51% up from the bottom of it in a straight line with a slight descent and then disappears.  It then reappears hovering for a fraction of a second on the left side of the moon inside that darker area as though it materialized out of nothing.  You can clearly see it didnt fly straight through solidly, the contrast of the dark patch on the left side of the moon makes it easier to see.  It then continued its path in the same direction behind the bare branches of the nearby tree.  I filmed it till it left my line of sight. It appeared to pulsars somewhat and with the lower resolutions you can see this pulsating more clearly.  I rewatched this Video a hundred times and truly its easy to obsess over because they I filmed this thing and its exciting.  My camera phone is a plain common android smart phone, nothing fancy.  I am sending you the whole 48 second video.  What I already posted online is a shortened 10 second version. I have seen It is of various sorts several times before. Last ones were 2015, 2 in 2014, here in Las Vegas, a whole bunch of them in 2011 and 2012 in Los Angeles and first one was 1994 in Oregon when I was a young kid.  This would be my first actual filming of a UFO in my whole life and funny that it was fully through chance and coincidence and perfect timing. I tried reporting this on the MUFON site but there is an error and forms cannot be submitted. I also tried sending the whole video but since it is 100.38MB and my email limit for attachments is 24MB I decided to upload it to Vimeo and peovide the link.

Was outside with my girlfriend in northwest Las Vegas when we heard a helicopter approach. As it was directly overhead, we both noticed its spotlight was aimed up as it proceeded to scan the clouds with its light. A few minutes passed as we watched the helicopter appearing to search for something in the sky near the mountains northwest of the city.  Then we saw the helicopter move its spotlight towards the ground and it flew out of sight.  For the next 30 minutes we heard helicopters flying overhead, but saw no lights at all.

UFO shot across the sky at remarkable speed and was gone in the blink of an eye, leaving a trail of “dust” like a plane would.;2020-05-15 15:45:00;1.5 seconds;UFO shot across the sky at remarkable speed and was gone in the blink of an eye, leaving a trail of “dust” like a plane would. As I was driving, the light was red, and I looked forward, with a view of the strip.  It was probably like 15 miles away.  As I blink, I see something shoot across the sky, to the right, faster than I have seen anything move before.  It was positioned right in front of the strip, starting in the middle of my view.  It came from nowhere.  There are no places to take off from directly in the middle of this area.  It was almost as if it was invisible in order to get to the spot it was located, then turned visible, and immediately flew away.  It left behind a line of dust, almost like you would see in the sky following an airplane.  It was not high enough in the air to be an airplane, and not nearly as slow as a helicopter.  It all happened so quick.  The “dust” disappeared after about 10 seconds.  There is no possible explanation for what I saw.  It just appeared out of thin air, and zoomed the other way.  I looked around at the other drivers and it looked like no one! was even paying attention to what just happened.  There were no clouds visible.  There is not a single way for what I saw to be debunked, or have an explanation other than something unworldly.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
amorphous and undefinable low-flying object on a clear blue sky afternoon;2021-03-28 12:35:00;5 minutes;amorphous and undefinable low-flying object on a clear blue sky afternoon It was just after 12:30 PM in the afternoon when my wife first saw the object. She was talking to me in my office on the second floor of our home. She had a puzzled look on her face to which I asked “What is it?“ and she replied “I am trying to figure out what the heck is in the sky.”  I got up and looked out the window to see what I can only describe as a shapeless or shapeshifting flying object. It was low in the sky, silent, and only a few hundred feet but less than 1000 feet above the ground. It was moving in a west to northwesterly direction. I estimate the distance away at 1-2 miles. The color was silver but was shifting in terms of brightness. It appeared to be reflective at times and transparent the next. The silvery/reflective color and shape changes were bizarre and difficult to explain. It appeared to have hard edges one second and rounded edges the next then back and forth without any pattern of shape change. After watching the object for about 30 seconds I grabbed my phone to record but it had moved out of view behind some houses. We have a rooftop deck and we both went outside to the roof for a better look. The object was still visible but seemed to have sped away from when we had lost sight of it only seconds before. It appeared to have chan! ged course to a more north-northwesterly direction. It continued to move in total silence, flying farther away and slowly gaining altitude. The air was calm, not a cloud in the sky.  As it moved away, I filmed the object. I was easier to see with the naked eye. The digital video does not show as much detail but in both the video and with our eyes we could see what appeared like fast-flickering lights. At times this flickering made it look like 2 objects. It was brighter than I would have expected from a reflection. The object was also quite large. Larger than the small planes and helicopters that are commonly seen from my rooftop deck. We watched and filmed the object as it flew away from us and eventually out of view, past more than 10 miles or so. The whole sighting was approximately 5 minutes. The location was the northwest suburbs of Las Vegas, close the mountains.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
