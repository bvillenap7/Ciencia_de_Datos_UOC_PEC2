Red and white flashing UFOs.;2011-05-26 22:30:00;5 minutes;Red and white flashing UFOs. We drove out to Red Rock National Park to look at the stars.  We then sighted a craft flying very high in the sky from South to North that was a tiny red light and would flash to a white light.   It flew for about 2 minutes until it was out of eye sight.  It was flying very fast.   We tried to compare to another airplane flying, but the plane was much slower, and we knew it was not a satellite. About 5 minutes later, about 10 miles ahead of us at the base of the mountain we saw a white light flash onto the mountain. It did this for about 1 minute until it turned into a single tiny red light once.  After the red light went off a bright white light began moving towards us.  We drove off in fear but then returned about 10 minutes later and sat in the same spot, and the lights were gone.  But we then heard a loud sound like a rumble right above our car, and there were no airplanes or anything around us to make the noise. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the data above.

Mysterious white-blue balls of light.;2014-08-13 22:30:00;1-2 seconds;Mysterious White-Blue Balls of Light I was sitting in the bed of a truck with a group of eight of my friends in front of one of their houses sometime between 10:00p.m. and 11:00p.m., when I looked up and saw a ball of white-blue light appear in the sky for a split second and then disappear.  About ten minutes later I saw another flash of light appear in the same way as the first and last for about a second, again like the first.  About five minutes after that one of my friends saw the same kind of light that I had described earlier that night, but he witnessed the light make a u shaped turn and disappear.  This light also lasted only about a second or two.  These are not the first lights in the sky our group of friends have seen.  One of my friends has seen numerous lights like the ones we saw last night (the 13th) and I also saw a light appear in the sky a couple weeks ago while we were at a bonfire on the edge of town.  This light looked like when you take a picture of any light source, but move the camera while taking it and are left with a squiggly line of light.  This light also appeared for only a second or two, but was moving.  I've seen shooting stars before but the balls of light were too bright, quick, blue-white and sudden to be shooting stars and the line of light was nowhere near straight (squiggly). ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  We have amended above the date of the sighting.  PD));36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

I was sitting in my truck in front of my boy's mom house while they went in to feed the dogs.  I notice a bright flash in the sky towards the north mountains behind the house.  We live on the outskirts of Vegas.  The light was moving very slow with sudden flashes.  I ran to the front door to get my two teenage boys so they could also witness what I was seeing.  As we stood there the lights continued to flash.  All the sudden a light took off in an upward diagonal direction as fast as a shooting star off into a cloud.  My oldest son also said he saw a light shoot straight up.  That us other two didn’t see.  There was one light that continued on West to east direction flashing in a bright flashing motion.  We decided to pull out our phones and record the remainder of what we were seeing.  Moments later we saw nothing it was all gone.  We continued to watch but there was nothing.  We’ve spent a lot of time in the outdoors and ha! ve never seen anything this dramatic in the night sky before.....;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
