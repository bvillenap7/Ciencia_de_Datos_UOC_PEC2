Las Vegas, Nevada -MARCH 12,1997  1.5 MILE WIDE CHEVRON  FORMATION OF LIGHTS SILENTLY GLIDES W. TO E. AT 8:40 pm.;1997-03-12 20:40:00;several minutes;Las Vegas, Nevada -MARCH 12,1997  1.5 MILE WIDE CHEVRON  FORMATION OF LIGHTS SILENTLY GLIDES W. TO E. AT 8:40 pm. Approximately 24 hours before the Phoenix Lights sighting(s)in Arizona, my next door neighbor and I were standing on the sidewalk in front of my home located in Northwest Las Vegas, Nevada on March 12,1997 at about 8:40 pm (20:40),when I glanced up(looking WNW) at the Spring Mountain area and saw a huge formation of off white or yellowish lights in a relaxed V or chevron shape gliding (ENE)directly towards and ultimately over our position!  I asked my neighbor if she was seeing what I was seeing and she confirmed same.  This formation of lights was very low (estimate slightly higher than local air traffic), and VERY wide (estimate 1.5 miles wide as I scanned the object) Our major intersections are approximately 1 mile apart, and I am located between Cheyenne and Craig Road off of Alexander, so the apparent width was fairly easy to guesstimate. This formation of a dozen or more lights didn't appear to have substance in between the lights, because as it slowly and silently moved directly over us we could see the night sky (stars) in between the lights of the formation. The sighting lasted probably 4 minutes.  I wanted to run in the house to grab my camera, but we were both kind of frozen on the spot watching this event. The formation of lights glided silently overhead towards the location of Nellis Air Force Base approximatey 16 miles ENE of our position.  As soon as the object? was out of sight my neighbor, (65 year old female) and I parted. I ran in the house and told my husband. I called Nellis Air Force Base to report what I'd seen, and the Airman on the other end didn't seem very interested and said he was in the basement, and probably couldn't see much anyway!  He suggested I contact your UFO Reporting Center. I also called KLAS TV Channel 8, and they were pretty vague, with no other calls at that time.  24 hours later the Phoenix lights stole the show in my neighboring state of Arizona!  I heard the hoopla on the Art Bell show March 13th as well.  I have tuned into his show since 1984 when he first started on the AM station in Las Vegas.  I did call Mr.Davenport about this sighting, and he asked me to write a letter documenting what my neighbor and I had seen.  I did so, but did not see it in the archives, when I was recently reading through them.  Please know I am not confusing the dates.  My Las Vegas Lights sighting 24 hours before Phoenix is etched forever in my memory, as March 12th is my brothers birthday, he had just left my home about 2 hours previously.  Did anyone else in Las Vegas see anything the night of March 12, 1997 at about 8:40 pm???  My background--- in 1997:Prior Nevada Test Site worker, employed by the EPA, prior service-Regular Army 1974. Female, 39 years old.  Well sighted and sober! ((NUFORC Note:  This witness also submitted a very nice hand-written report, composed on March 20, 1997.  We have spoken with her via telephone, and she seems quite credible to us.  She will appear on the Coast to Coast radio program on March 11, 2006, in order to describe her experience and sighting.  PD));36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
4 lights in clear/clouds stopping/moving/hispeed @ sharp angleslrg chevron/luminous objects form from gaseous bar/moves overhead;1999-04-24 21:00:00;15 minutes;4 lights in clear/clouds stopping/moving/hispeed @ sharp angleslrg chevron/luminous objects form from gaseous bar/moves overhead On April 24, 1999 @ 9:00pm, 4 of us walked out of the Monte Carlo Casino and saw a small group of people pointing at 4 lights in the southeast sky. These lights appeared to be interacting with each other, moving at high speeds, occasionally stopping and moving at extreme angles. The sky was fairly clear with some high clouds. These lights appeared to move behind and through the clouds on occasion. Within a few minutes, there were approx. 50 to 75 people witnessing the event. I could overhear several comments from the other people, and some were suggesting that perhaps they were high flying birds reflecting the lights from the strip. However, I thought that it was highly unlikely since the lights seemed to be very high and moving at extreme speeds. Approx. 5 minutes later, I began to see this long, thin vaporous line move across the sky in front of these 4 lights. It captured my interest because it appeared to move in a deliberate fashion. After observing this for several seconds, the gaseous line instantly materialized into 10 to 15 round, luminous objects that appeared to have all colors of the spectrum, and quite larger than the original 4 lights. They moved slowly high overhead in a chevron formation making no sound. One of the original 4 lights then joined with the objects as they continued high above. I had to bend my neck completely back almost losing my balance to continue observing the phenomenon until it went over the Monte Carlo Casino and was obscured from my sight. Immediately, people began to shout with excitement. Some women were crying with fear, and some of the skeptics were stunned and annoyed that they could not explain it. I was absolutely blown away by what I saw. Perhaps, I could be persuaded to believe in some plausible explanation for the original 4 lights, but this phenomenon could not be explained away as birds, lasers, aircraft, satellites, or natural occurences, i.e., asteroids, meteorites, ball lightening or swamp gas. As we stood around in amazement, we continued to watch the remaining 3 lights in the sky. A minute or so later, I began to observe another vaporous line coming now from a point further south than the first, moving slowly, and instantly materializing again into 10 to 15 round, luminous objects moving in a chevron formation. Each time, it appeared that the objects were moving independently from each other but in formation. It did not appear to be one solid object. Unfortunately, approx. 15 minutes had gone by and the 4 of us had to get to the airport to make our flight back home to Seattle. The lights were still being observed as we walked away. The next day, I called the Las Vegas Journal to see if anything was reported. The Editor laughed and said there always was strange stuff going on in the sky and was not interested in getting my story. Background of Observers: 1. Myself, 38 yr old female with a college degree working as a leading corporate Human Resources Consultant and Trainer in Seattle.

Bright lights larger than a plane, orangish in color over Las Vegas.;2001-05-21 21:45:00;3 min;Bright lights larger than a plane, orangish in color over Las Vegas. We were on our patio having a late dinner and we were watching the planes land at the airport.  I turned to my husband and said what kind of plane is that?  It was huge.  He said it wasn't a plane it was too big and it wasn't moving.  I said get the camera. He got the camera and started taking pictures.  I got on the phone and called the news station and they said I was the only call they had received and that they would check into it.  The lights were Very bright.  Three across. Kind of an orangish color.  They were situated for above the 'Mandalay bay' hotel (that is where they looked like they were from our view) they seemed to tilt a little bit. Then one by one the lights slowly faded until they were gone.  A little while later (about 15 min.) they were back but farther towards the mountains (more towards the Stratosphere) They were in more of a chevron v.  Same thing happened but this time I called a couple of people to look and the only one to answer was my sister-in-law, but from her home she couldn't see anything.  I called another news station and the guy just laughed.  I told him we had pictures but all he said was he would check it out.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Flying wing, very large, silent.....;2001-07-18 22:00:00;10 seconds;Flying wing, very large, silent..... While hot tubbing at my residence in North Las Veags,  I was checking out the night sky which is what I usually do when I spa.  Directly above, I noticed what appeared to be an object with a flying wing shape moving in the direction of ESE.  It had very faint amber aura on the leading edge and was blackish/brown in color...very difficult to see unless looking directly at it.  It appeared to be huge, dwarfing any aircraft that I have ever seen flying, cruising high (est. 10,000+feet), moving swiftly and silently in a straight line.  It covered alot of arc in the sky in a brief time, I saw it for about 10 seconds.  I thought it could have been a B-2 bomber (I have seen them at airshows), but this seemed significantly larger...it seemed odd to me, but it was quite interesting to say the least.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
probably a secret from area 51;2002-07-05 02:00:00;3 minutes;probably a secret from area 51 at approx 2:00 am while leaving las vegas, on route 15, my vehicle was almost knocked off the road, i thought it was an earthquake, we pulled over and stopped. got out of the car and again an extremely loud explosion over head.  sounded like something breaking the sound barrier. (jet)  however, i have been a military man for 6 years, and a police man for another 5 years, and never have i hear anything this loud or this fast... now i say fast because it made a third pass. and this time we could see the most incredilbe plane or whatever..  it was moving very slow, compared to what we assumed.  estimated speed maybe 100 mph. seem to be floating.  then all of a sudden, gone, not flew away, just disappeared, and about 30 seconds after it vanished, bang another loud explosion, this time we were almost knocked off our feet. the concussion sas great.  no we were not drinking, nor do we have any drug problem.  did not report this to anyone, nor will i ever report it.  just thought you would like to know, seems to be from my view, not a ufo as most think, but a ufo of our u.s.a.  its really not our business.  when the gov. wants us to know, they will let us know.

Im 49 yeas of age and  I have live very close to Nellis afb for the past 15 years. Within the past 5 years I have been a regular night sky watcher . While things have been real slow the past 2 years ,it certainly was not the case 3-4 years ago . But I still take time to view at least once or twice a week .That being said , While laying on my back looking and scanning skyward ( I use nite vision due to so much light pollution here and I have managed to darken the street lamps around my location ) expecting at best to view a few satellites or un explained light movements since it is extremly hard to distinguish shape and form at the usual distance I encounter as  I work the sky  in quadrants I was totally taken back when from the NNE I caught the outline of a V shape closing in. At that initial distance I thought it was a repeat of the diamond formation of four indivisual craft That I viewed 3 years earlier ,As it became closer I realized it was a single craft, very large, how large I cannot say as I had no reference pointsbut easily seen with scope  sillouetted against a las vegas night sky . B-2 was a quik second guess as it had more ov a delta shspe but this was quickly elimanated as it passed directly overhead it was more delta shaped leaning more to a boomerrang -V shaped another thing that i found aerodynamically strange was one side being slightly more elongnated than the other, there seem to be darker pod shapes under each side (wing??) still no lights and no sound and no contrails of any kind and was not on a glide slope of any kind as it was definitly under its on power. Also never has there been any commercial traffic use this path that I can recall in all my years here . Its speed seem to be at a pretty good clip my guess is at least 400 knots but hard to say as I had very little reference points as to size, height  only that it covered f! rom my i nitial sighting which was approx 20 deg above the north horizen (darker sky & better viewing) to where I lost sight as it approached the more lit up sky over the strip approx 11 mi away in about 40  to 45sec . Ive seen many strange sights in the late nite early morning skies here bbut not much to speak of in the 2 years until this nite ..And it was good enough to make me want to write this and send for the first time . I have seen some interesting things with multible sightings on many occasions here and would gladly elaborate if interested fill free to contact me via email  ((e-address deleted));36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Chevron-shaped flying wing with 7 large round white lights;2010-04-29 00:52:00;3-4 seconds;Chevron-shaped flying wing with 7 large round white lights I was outside of the Aria Hotel & Casino at 12:52 am on Thursday morning, 4/29/10, looking up and admiring the enormous structure when movement in the sky above me caught my eye. I saw that it was a black flying wing/chevron shaped craft made of just 2 wings joined together at an angle of approximately 160 degrees. Each wing was a long narrow black rectangle the wingtip edges did not taper at all and were squared off at 90 degrees, but with rounded corners. Arrayed along these wings were 7 round, white, non-blinking lights equidistant from each other and the front and rear edges, from tip to tip the fourth central light was right on the central axis where the 2 wings would join (if they were separate pieces). The diameter of each of these 7 lights was approximately 50% of the width of the wing from the front edge to the back edge. It is very difficult to judge never having been close to the craft to get a sense of scale, but its size may have been as much as 180 - 200 feet from left to right, and it may have been traveling at an altitude of 1200 feet. It is also possible that it was a larger craft traveling faster and higher, or a smaller craft traveling lower and slower at any rate the speed I observed it moving at was almost leisurely. Its direction of movement was due west, or with a very slight northwest component, and it was silent. It was in my line of sight for 3-4 seconds before it moved out of sight behind the roofline of the entrance to the Aria.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

The object was above the light clouds, had no lights and had no discernible sound. The object was approximately 1000 feet from tip to tip (large passenger planes that fly in the same area would be about 1/10th the size). I attempted to get a video with my iPhone X but could only see darkness on the video. I have been hesitant to report this but needed to get it off my mind as it has really changed my view of the world. Signed, Former sceptic;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
