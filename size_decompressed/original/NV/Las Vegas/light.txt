On December 20, 1989 I and two co-workers were on our way to Aspen,CO. We were driving a 24Ft. rental truck loaded with items for our employer's winter home.We were approximately 60-70 miles north-east of Las Vegas when we heard cargo in the rear of the truck shift. I pulled over to check the cargo and found everything secure. We all took this opportunity to stretch our legs and while facing away from the highway and looking in a southerly direction,I noticed six pairs of strobing red lights. They were located on a east-west plane and seemed to be evenly spaced. A large mountain stood in the distance andI later learned that it was Virgin Peak. What caught my attention readily was the very slow strob speed of the lights. I looked for other color patterns and none were visable. It is almost impossible for me to determine distance or height of objects, and no shape patterns were visable due to impending sunset.There was no noticable noise at the onset of sighting. After viewing objects for approximtely 2-3 minutes we noticed the sound of jet aircraft. Suddenly from a north-west direction two F-15 fighters flew over at a tremendous rate of speed. I would estimate that they were flying at approximately 500 feet and as they passed the ground reverberated with the sonic boom. We all watched in awe as the pairs of red strobbing lights moved tremendously fast to the east and suddenly in unison changed course to the south-east and raised altitude until they vanished. This all took place within a matter of seconds, and the pursuing fighters had no chance what so ever to catch these objects. This was truly a hair-raising experience for all of us and we did not waste any time in exiting the area.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
strange lights north of Las Vegas;1990-10-15 17:00:00;1 hour.;strange lights north of Las Vegas A friend and I were in my Jeep out in the Floyd Lamb wilderness area north of Las Vegas. We had gone out there looking at agave roasting rings, and just checking out the country. The date is approx. It could have been any time between 1988 and 1992. The sun had just gone down but it was still light out. We were on the north end of a small valley, having followed a jeep trail up an aluvial fan untill it ended. We had stopped to take a leak and, while looking south toward Las Vegas, we saw a very bright light rise from behind the hills on the other end of the valley and stop. We were a couple of valleys north of Vegas, so it appeared to have risen from a valley between us and Las Vegas. It sat perfectly still for so long that I began to think that I hadn't seen it rise, and that it was venus or something. But then it slowly dropped back behind the hill. After awhile, it rose back up and then started to move around. The way it moved was amazing. It would go from stopped to moving very fast with no acceleration or deceleration time. It would do geometric patterns with 90 degree angles without slowing down. It would get very bright and then get so dim we could hardly see it. Then it dropped behind the hill. Shortly after it rose the next time, another one came up. They sat perfectly still for just a moment and then they instantly started moving fast, flying in a chaotic pattern all around each other... like gnats, or humming birds. Then, they both darted out of sight. Shortly after they were gone (it was then completly dark) several helicoptors came over the hill from the  southeast (the dirrection of nellis AFB). They seemed to be combing the area. So my friend and I headded back. On the way down out of the park there was an area where we could briefly see the road further down, before a turn in the road obscured our view. In that brief time we saw a white truck with a shell. Looked like a government truck. By the time we could see the road again it was gone, and I'm pretty sure there was no other road. It! must ha ve cut cross country because it didn't pass us and it wasn't between us and the 95 once we got out of the canyon. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

Green light moving north at speed through east side of las vegas.;1992-06-15 22:00:00;30 seconds;Green light moving north at speed through east side of las vegas. I was travleing south on Hwy 95 heading from Las Vegas to the city of Henderson passing near the football stadium. All the lights were on, which is what attracted my attention, when I observed a green glowing ball of light traveling north. It appeared to be half way between the stadium and the highway 300 to 400 feet off the ground. The object itself was translucent in nature traveling at a good clip but not so fast as not be able to track it. The area it was in is protected airspace as it was under the flight path of McCarran International Airport. The course it was on would have taken it past Sunrise Mt. and directly over Nellis AFB. The local news did air a report that night of a green light sighted, however it was reported some 15 miles north of where I saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

number of strange lights seen in NV test site  Area 51 months before phoenix sighting;1996-11-16 16:30:00;1 hour;number of strange lights seen in NV test site  Area 51 months before phoenix sighting well im a truck driver and i was heading back to vegas from a run to st.george utah.about an hour from home outside a little town called Glendale NV  to the southeast of the test site and the infamous area 51 I noticed a light over the range.I didnt think much of it at first, thinking it was just a helocopter heading to nellis AFB.Than i noticed another light catching my attention abit,but still thinking they were helocopters.Now i was through Glendale and noticed four lights now i was courious and had to pull over to watch.I pulled off the interstate and drove out into the desert a ways about a 1/4 mile off the freeway.Now there were more lights.They looked to be over a small mountain range that lies between I-15 and highway 93 with the test site border just beyond. the color cought my attention because it looked very similar to the dull orange of street lights,most of them were in pairs one above the other,than there was what i assumed to be one with six lights going horizantaly, and they strobed off and on is the best way i can put it from left to right.I remember looking back at the highway thinking to myself cant anyone else see this because as of yet i was the only one watching.Than a few other cars pulled off a ways from me. The other doul sets of lights appeared to be playing one set would dim out and another would dim on like someone turning up a dimmer switch. most of the lights were stationary there were a few moving around slowly.I even called McCarren airport trying to se if they were seeing anything i felt like a wacco after that call,I think they sure thought i was.It was around 4:30 when i first started watching them and they stayed for about an hour and ten minutes.it was lightly overcast and they light up the clouds above them.Than about 50 minutes into it a flight of jets comming out of Nellis were heading in there direction and turned slightly and headed into the bombing range.At about an hour and ten the lights started decending below the mountains.I could still see ! the glow over the mountains from their lights,and one by one like someone turning off light switches from left to right the went out.I waited around for about another 20 minutes or so and nothing more happened,so i headed on to Vegas.As I was coming over the hill into vegas i counted 19 ore fighters comming out of Nellis with their afterburners full throtle heading northwest.This seemed a little odd because Nellis doesnt do alot of night manouvers and even during the day you dont usually see as many as 19 jets taking off at the same time.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Saw a stationary star all of a sudden zip to the west, across the southwest sky.;1996-11-17 21:00:00;1 to 2 sec.;Saw a stationary star all of a sudden zip to the west, across the southwest sky. I was on my patio with my binoculars watching the outbound aircraft from McCarren airport.  I was following one aircraft for a while.  There were two stars that came into view as the aircraft flew into the distance.  All of a sudden the star on the right shot towards the west at an unbelievable speed.   It was as  if it was waiting for the aircraft to pass.  It looked just like a star.  You could not tell if from the billions of stars out that night.   I continued to search for it.  But never found it.  I know it wasn't a reflection.  I lived out south of town away from most of the lights of the city. ;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

No sound. Sited again on 3/8/97.  Have photos. Formation of lights around 9:0 clock high.  One or two lights in front moving horizontally.Moved downward in a double-helix formation.  Reformed to a v-shape and flew overhead.  Saw again on 3/8/97, about 20 lights in a jumble.  Several lights shot down toward the ground (looking  South).  Have photos of this.  They reformed to a v-shape and flew North.  A few days later saw v-shape formation flyingSouth then North.  Took photos with Stratosphere Casino in background.  There was no sound.  Their lights were a golden/white color. It was very exciting as they flew off to the North.  I felt that it was a fleet and not one object.  It was difficult to judge distance but I was looking over the Las Vegas strip toward the airport.  All of the above was at night around midnight to 1:00 am. Between all of the above I saw at noon a golden orb hovering. When I went in to get my camera (about 10 seconds)it was gone when I came out.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

While looking up at the starry nite sky, noticed a single orange or amber light, traveling SSE at unknown speed and altitude.  The object appeared to the northwest of our position and traveled silently over our heads to the Southeast.  It was on a steady course and did not blink or vary in intensity.   It remained visible on a steady course for about 10 minutes.  It appeared to be a dim amber bulb but did not flicker.   No strobe, no red or green position lights, no flame or noise like a hot air balloon burner.  No shape was apparent and it was traveling solo.

Set of 7 or 8 orange lights moving silently at airliner velocity, size and altitude over Las Vegas Nevada;1997-05-09 21:00:00;5 minutes;Set of 7 or 8 orange lights moving silently at airliner velocity, size and altitude over Las Vegas Nevada I observed 7 or 8 amber lights that I at first thought to be an aircraft coming from McCarran airport.  I was facing south from the area of Decatur and Charleston. I was intrigued because the lights were a bit unusual.  I watched them coming towards my location.  Two of the lights appeared to be closer than the rest as they appeared to separate slightly from the rest as they got closer, as if they were a bit forward of the others.  All lights appeared to be connected to one object since they did not move with respect to one another except for the above. As it got a bit closer I realized that it was NOT an airplane.  I nudged my friend I was sitting with and said: LOOK AT THAT!  She watched it pass directly overhead with me. It was totally silent. I estimate the velocity to be 300 to 500 knots, similar to an aircraft and an altitude of 2500 to 5000 feet.  The object covered about 3 to 7 degrees of arc from my view at its closest. About two weeks later the TV show sightings had video of a UFO that appeared almost identical.  It was from some other state much earlier.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

4 lights/hovering/moving radically about 1 general area gaseous area resolves to chevron formation of jewel color lights/ move slowly ;1999-04-24 21:00:00;15 minutes;4 lights/hovering/moving radically about 1 general area gaseous area resolves to chevron formation of jewel color lights/ move slowly over us Exiting Monte Carlo Casino in Las Vegas on Sat. Apr 24 around 8:45 to 9:00 p.m., my wife and her brother called my attention to UFO's over the MGM (S.E.ly maybe 20 to 30 degrees from overhead). At first, I didn't see them and thought they were joking, but I then observed 20 or so people in front of me looking in the same direction and pointing. With the help of my brother-in-law, I was able to locate 4 round lights. (The size of each in relation to my hand at arm's length was roughly like looking at an eraser on the end of a pencil.) The sky was generally clear, but the four lights were in the area of one of the few clouds in the sky. The lights were all staying in the general area of the cloud, but would move into a gap in the cloud and sometimes out from behind the cloud completely. Even when behind the cloud, the lights were visible. The movement of the lights was very intriguing. Each would hover for a bit, then it might move in a sweeping manner upward. Sometimes one would streak horizontally and then would instantaneously reverse course or move at a radical angle. Each of the lights was moving independently of the others. This continued for several minutes. My wife then exclaimed, Look at that! and pointed just a little south of the cloud. I looked in time to see what I would call a gaseous light, greenish in hue, significantly larger than the round lights. It was like looking at an image through heat waves in the desert. I estimate it was three to four inches relative to my hand at arm's length. Within ten seconds or so the gaseous area resolved into more precise lights, jewel-like and muti-colored and the lights were in a formation that changed and within a few more seconds, appeared as a chevron shape, keeping the same overall size as the initial gaseous image. It then moved towards us, keeping a constant height and a smooth and steady course. I notice a round light, that looked like one of the first lights that we had observed, was flying just to my left of the chevron formation. Looking back into the cloud area at the first lights, I could now only find three of the round lights. They were still hovering and/or moving as before. The chevron/round light formation was continuing on its course and speed and slowly moved directly overhead and beyond until it was eventually obscurred by the Monte Carlo building. I strained to see if I could make out an object in the lights or hear any sound coming from the formation, but could not. Looking back to the area where the chevron first appeared, the gaseous image resolving to chevron event repeated. Again, the chevron was joined by a round light. I now could only see two round lights in the cloud area. The combo formation was, like the first, moving towards us. I looked from the sky to the area in which we were standing and noticed that there were now many more people watching the event. Most were exclaiming in amazement, myself included. When the first chevron appeared, I had heard many people shout as had my wife. There were a few cries of fear. It also looked like people on the other side of Las Vegas Boulevard in front of the MGM were also looking skyward and pointing. We crossed the street to the area in front of the New York, New York Casino. The second chevron had now disappeared from view over the Monte Carlo. I could now only see one of the original round lights. I pointed it out to a person coming out of the casino who said that he had seen this event before and that it was a bird, like a hawk, with ground lights reflecting off of it. He did not observe the chevron lights. A few other random observations: We observed the event for about fifteen minutes. I wanted to stay longer, but we had to leave to catch a flight at the airport. Early in the event, I noticed a small civilian aircraft in the general area, but it was lower and farther to the east. The event took place relatively close to the Las Vegas airport. Another friend that accompanied us never saw the round lights, but witnessed the chevrons. Although he is highly skeptical by nature, he had no explanation for what he saw. The MGM has large green lights that illuminate the building. The Luxor, farther south on the Strip, has a laser on top. I am not sure how high the clouds were and consequently have difficulty estimating the actual size or altitude of the formation. I have racked my brain trying to come up with an explanation for what we observed. I do not buy into the bird theory because of the relative speed in relation to the clouds, the radical flight patterns of the round lights, the visibility behind the clouds. Holographic images don't seen to fit either because of the great distance traveled by the chevrons. Also, at no time were the clouds themselves ever illuminated. We watched the paper for reports of the observation by others. My wife called the newspaper in Las Vegas. They said that they had not received any reports. They did not seem interested in her report. We recently learned of this site and decided to report our experience.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

I was in the house when my husband who had been sitting out in the yard stuck his head in the door and said to come outside to see some UFOs. I ran out to look  and over the city traveling northwest were several ( 3 to 4 that I could see ) red orange swirling lights in a vee formation moving slowly above the city. As I was panicking and trying to call 911 for other witnesses. My husband said that the lights were being followed by jets.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

I only saw 4 red lights, there may have been more.  They moved very quickly in and out of formations such as a V like geese.  Shortly went out of view perhaps moving towards the Nevada Test site?  I observed them from Buffalo and Lone Mtn intersection.  About a minute later after arriving at home, they had disappeared, but a group of 4 Nellis fighters were flying in the direction the lights were seen.  Shortly after that, another group of 4 fighters headed in the same direction.  The flashing lights of the fighters were seen to eventually head first west from the AFB, but ended up more N above the Sheep Mtn Rng. These objects appear to be the same ones I heard Peter D on Art Bell's show tonight (6/9) describe by another person(s).;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
A moving object which possibly changed speed and direction in an unorthodox manner;1999-10-01 19:00:00;app. 15 seconds;A moving object which possibly changed speed and direction in an unorthodox manner I was walking into a local video store and looked up into the skies like I frequently do ever since my father introduced my to the idea of catching a satellite every now and again. I still look for them for fun. I was facing south and I looked directly overhead and immediately saw a bright star-like object (about as bright as Venus or a high flying jet if it is coming at you from a distance) which was moving at a normal pace (for a jet) in a direct southward trajectory until it slowed and then stopped. It did not stop abruptly, but slowed first. The light then just slowly faded out, getting smaller and smaller until it was no longer visible (this took about 3 to 4 seconds). While the behavior of the object and the fading light most likely has an orthodox explanation of which I am ignorant, the event seemed somewhat signifigant.  NOTE: I am requesting contact from an investigator with this report due to events in my past and NOT for this individual sighting, as well as an general exchange of information.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Strange light moving over Vegas at a great speed;2000-06-26 22:40:00;2 min.;Strange light moving over Vegas at a great speed At or about 10:40 PM while I was letting my dogs out for their nightly ritual I looked up into the sky to the north - northwest.  I caught a glimpse of what appeared to be an airplane moving slowly across the sky, as it moved over head I then thought it was a satelite due to the extreme altitude and that the light never blinked.  Just after the light passed directly over head it increased to a speed four times faster as it headed south. It made no sound, left no contrail As I moved out away from my house to keep sight of it, 2 airforce jets flying in a tight formation flew north to where I first spotted the light, then turned south hard towards the objects flight path.  I ran through the house and out the back door the object was pulling away from the jets at an incredible rate.  The jets broke off and headed back north.  I have lived in Las Vegas for 13 years and I have been to the edge of Area-51 and seen things in the sky that I could not explain but never have I seen something fly over the city and display speeds of this nature.  This object was at an incredible altitude and the speed was remarkable.  Can satelites increase their speed?  Did anyone else see this?;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

PD)) I was driving with a friend and saw this illuminating bright white light shining through a green haze. What I saw was unexplainable. There was a light, which looked like a police helicopters light, surrounded by a green illuminating haze. As if the light was shining through green clouds. The object moved from one point in the sky to another. Then it was if the object was going further back up in the sky and faded away. The green haze was still there, and that too faded.

Las Vegas Lights;2000-07-25 21:30:00;15-20 minutes;Las Vegas Lights I didn't know of your existence until I just heard you on Art Bell's show on the night of his return to radio ...in fact, you are still on the air. I had never seen anything interesting in the night sky until the night of July 25, 2000. After this event I immediately typed up what I saw and sent a fax right off to Mike Seigal at Coast to Coast AM. As far as I know he never covered it ...and I don't know of anyone but the 3 of us who were present who saw this event. However, I thought you might like to add it to your records and perhaps someone else has sent an account of it to you as well. Here is the text that I typed: Attn: Mike It is now 10:25 pm (July 25, 2000) Pacific. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada and just less than an hour ago I was on the very south end of the valley looking north towards the Stratosphere Tower (a distance of 10-15 miles if I had to guess) ...showing a guest of mine from the East Coast a nice view of the Strip from a high elevation. There were three of us present and we noticed extremely bright glowing lights at approximately the level of the Tower, but well beyond it. You could see the lights of aircraft crossing the Las Vegas Valley, but these lights were 20-30 times brighter and stationary with a slight drift to the right (East). One of these lights dropped suddenly to the valley floor and disappeared. After several minutes the others flickered and faded as well. As soon as they were gone another set appeared at a much higher elevation ...in relation to the tower, almost twice as high. These kept fading after about five minutes and reappearing in sets of two and three ...only a single time was there only one light in the sky. I called a local television station, KLAS channel 8 and asked them if anyone else had reported this ...they said no, but said they'd train their stationary cameras on it (in retrospect, I don't think they took what I was saying seriously). All the while the Vegas.com blimp, a tourist airship here in Las Vegas was in the sky and provided a good point of reference. They took off from the North Las Vegas airport, about 25 miles from where I was in the valley, but they were much smaller (the airship is lit from the interior and the size of the Goodyear Blimp) in relation to the size and brightness of the lights. The best analogy I can draw is to the Phoenix Lights incident of '97 that I've seen time and again on TV. Unfortunately I didn't have a camera, but this incident was far and away more interesting than the Phoenix one. I understand that some explanations there include military flares, and this could have been what I witnessed. However, some of the lights dropped all the way to the! Valley floor and I wouldn't have expected that to happen if military excercises were being conducted on the Nellis Range over the other side of the mountain range in the north part of the Valley. However, as I mentioned, these lights did not all descend in elevation ...what one would expect if they were flares attached to parachutes. I hope that someone captured this on video ...there must have been many eyewitnesses, including those in the blimp, in the airport tower, and elsewhere. I'm also curious if this will be discussed on the 11 o'clock news, but as I finish typing this it is now only 10:35 and being a listener from time to time of your show I thought that you might enjoy this bit of information. Please feel free to contact me. Best Regards, ((deleted)) XXXXXXX 702-XXX-XXXX;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
4 bright orange lights over the mountains north of Las Vegas - fading in and out and slowly moving;2001-03-12 20:22:00;20+min;4 bright orange lights over the mountains north of Las Vegas - fading in and out and slowly moving Four very bright orange lights were seen in the north direction (in a diagonal between Henderson Airport (near where I live)and the Stratosphere Tower, possibly as far north as the mountains on the north side of the valley.  They were the color of sodium lights and just as bright as one you would see 2 blocks away.  Definitley not the color of airplane lights.  I first saw two lights, then two more faded on at a higher altitude (closer?).  The lights then proceeded to fade out either in pairs or singly.  They were moving slowly and would fade in and out as they moved horizontally and vertically. The horizon line of the mountains would not be explainable as lights higher would fade out while lower ones remained. Just after the last one faded another one lit up slightly to the right and higher for about 5 seconds.  Perhaps the military uses different colored (and brighter) lights on helicopters?  They were not flares as they moved horizontally.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Randomly flashing red and green lights at night. No visible body even when illuminated by lightning. Saw from commercial airliner.;2001-08-12 21:05:00;10-15 seconds;Randomly flashing red and green lights at night. No visible body even when illuminated by lightning. Saw from commercial airliner. I was on a SW airline flight from San Jose to Phoenix, ~35,000 ft and 500 knots. I don't know the exact location because the plane flew futher west than usual to avoid a thunderstorm. We were over CA 15 minutes before because I recognized all of the city lights from the San Jauquin valley. Then everything went black, so I assumed we went far enough east to be in Nevada. I was looking at the lightning going mostly cloud to cloud in a 50 mile wide thunderhead to the east at about 40,000 feet. Then I saw red and green lights fly at a 90 degree angle to the plane (I was on the left side of the plane, and it was flying east. I assume we were flying south). It was flying at about 20,000 ft. I watched it for a few seconds, and didn't think much of it until I noticed how fast it was going. I spent four years in the Air Force, so I just thought it was a fighter. It was going at least 1,000 mph, because it was going at least twice as fast as other airliners going perpendicular to the one I was in. I always get a window seat and I spend most of my flying time looking out the window. Then I noticed that the lights were not flashing periodically like a plane, but randomly. Sometimes there were more than one red, and the lights didn't stay on for the same durations either. It actually looked like the whole aircraft was either red or green because I could not see an aircraft body unless it emitting either the red or green, even when lightning lit up the sky, which it did at least once. I watched it intensely. After about five seconds, it did a u-turn (changed its bearing by 170 degrees to about 280) in less than 100 milliseconds. Not only are there no planes that can do that, that stunt would have instantly killed anyone in the aircraft because of the g-forces. Then after about one-two seconds of heading almost straight toward the plane, but still 15,000 feet lower, it headed straight up to about 25,000 feet in less than one second. I figure one mile per second is 3,600 mph, straight up. Then it changed course and he! aded NE and disappeared into the thunderhead in less than one second, at a speed more then twice before. It seemed to be seeking out the lightning. In other words, If I was in an aircraft with that much capability, and I wanted to be hit by lightning, that's the exact flight path I would have took, assuming that I was coming from the west. About five minutes later, I asked the stewardess to ask the pilot if they saw anything on radar back then. They said no other aircraft in the vicinity for longer than that. After we landed, I told the pilot and he didn't seem to care and told me to report it to the FAA if i wanted to. That's all folks.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
lights over mountains chased by f-16's;2002-01-01 22:30:00;5 minutes;lights over mountains chased by f-16's One night my roomate amd I were out side on the patio. I noticed a yellow-orange light raise up over the mountains behind our apartment (Eagle Trace Apartments) and then just hover there. I was joking aroung about it being a UFO when all of a sudden 5 more came up to the same level one after another and spaced about an 1/8th of a mile apart all of them were evenly spaced and at the same altitude, about 100 ft. above the mountain. We lived right across the street from Nellis AFB and we could hear planes taking off. We thought they were just going out to the range but instead they headed twords the mountain. We thought ,ok they were just flares even though they were not over the range and this is when the lights faded to very pale blue lights and were much smaller in size, almost too small to even see unless you knew they were there. I dont think the objects got smaller. I think it was just the intnsity of the lights was far less. But anyway, as the jets, F-16's I'm pretty sure, got closer towards the lights, the lights went from hovering to heading left twords downtown Las Vegas at a high rate of speed. Eventualy we couldnt see the lights anymore because of the city lights but we could see the jets for a while. It was really weird. Another thing that has nothing to do with this night but I have always noticed about this mountain. This is the mountain right behind Las vegas Speedway. During certain times throughout the year there is something very shiny reflecting the sun on top of the highest peak on the far left of this mountain. I didnt see any antennas or anything up there. I used to notice it when I would come home from work at Nellis. Always wondered what it was, still dont know ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Crazy light in the sky disentegrates;2002-03-15 18:15:00;30 seconds;Crazy light in the sky disentegrates Approximately 6:15 pm on Friday Marcg 15,2002, my sister and I were sitting in the Taco Bell drive through waiting behind several cars for our turn to order.  Over the mountains on the west side of town there was a like a lightning bolt shaped crack in the sky with light shining through.  There was a spot of light- for lack of a better word- that was flying around with a light that was shining down from it. It definitely wasn't a plane, helicopter or anything else. It was just a piece of light. After watching this for about 30seconds the light broke into 4 peices and then each of the 4 pieces broke into millions of pieces and then they all just evaporated into thin air.  We had to pull up to the drive through window at this point and our view of the mountains was blocked by the UMC quick care.  After we had received our order we looked back at the sky and the crack was gone. I know that this sounds crazy but we are not crazy in the head. My sister is in the service and I attend college and have a full time job as a vet tech. I'm glad that she was there with me and saw the whole thing so at least we each have someone who believes us. I don't know if this has any relevance, but today happens to be the dark of the moon. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of the missile launch out of Vandenberg AFB.

Two white lights in the daytime sky;2002-12-07 10:10:00;1min;Two white lights in the daytime sky I was outside of the building I work in and heard a helicoptor flying nearby.  When I looked up to see where it was I noticed what I first thought to be a airliner flying at high altitude from east to west.  When it stopped and appeared to be falling i realised it was not an airliner but a dot of light instead.  It seamed to be falling for about ten to fifteen seconds when it suddenly moved back to the west very fast.  That is when I noticed a second dot of light that the first had moved to and stopped.  Both dots of light were stationary at that point and did not appear to be changing altitude.  I called my co-workers to come and look but the dots seemed to slowly gain altitude and fade away before they were able to spot them.  I was a clear day with scattered light clouds and excellent visibility at the time.  It should also be noted that I am a former air defense crew member and have had extensive aircraft recognition training.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Amber orbs of light above the city of Las Vegas.;2003-03-17 20:30:00;30 minutes;Amber orbs of light above the city of Las Vegas. On March 17, 2003 (St. Patrick’s Day), I was in my backyard in Henderson, NV., a suburb of Las Vegas.  I was doing some star gazing with my Celestron telescope.   Sometime after 8pm, I saw a horizontal row of lights hovering about the Las Vegas strip.  They were an amber color, almost iridescent.  I thought they were lights on one giant aircraft.  They were spread out like what appeared to be several city blocks.  Then they disappeared, all almost at the same time. I stood there for several minutes in awe, trying to comprehend what I just saw.  Eventually I went back to my telescope however I kept looking around the sky with my eyes.  A few minutes later, I saw three lights again, this time in a triangle formation.  It was at this point that I figured each light must be its own craft.  I ran in the house and grabbed my video camera as fast as I could.  I proceeded to record what I saw. I had to keep turning my eyes away from the camera screen, as the camera did not do justice to what my eyes could see (although the video turned out pretty good).  The bottom light disappeared, and then two more lights flickered into view above the remaining two, and disappeared almost as fast as they appeared.  Then the one on the right, to my perspective, disappeared about 20 seconds later. Finally, after about 30 more seconds the last one disappeared.  A few minutes later, one appeared again, and remained stationary for a few minutes before disappearing.  Before it disappeared, a regular plane appeared to fly by the object. I don’t know if I should report the next incident as a second occurrence or not, but I saw another UFO 10 days later.  I happened to watch a show about UFOs where a man described seeing almost exactly what I saw, and said he saw them again 10 days later.  So, on a whim, I took my camera outside about the same time, 10 days later.  I was shocked to see another one, and I filmed it.  This second occurrence was strange. The light moved slowly higher and to the east.  Eventually, it turned from a large amber-like orb of light, to a small, strange, strobe-like light.  This was not like the strobe on an airplane though.  I have the whole incident on tape. After a few minutes, I saw two more strobe-like lights appear, near the same proximity.  It was almost as if the one was signaling the others, and they started to signal back. It was very strange to say the least. The strobes were very small, and eventually, I just couldn’t see them anymore.  The second incident lasted approximately 20 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to obtain more information.  The video does, indeed, show the lights, precisely as the witness describes above, although we do not know what they are.  Ordinarily, we would allow for the possibility that they might have been landing lights on several airliners on long final approach, but they would not be visible for 30 minutes.

Balls of light in the shape of a triangle;2005-07-15 22:45:00;1 min;Balls of light in the shape of a triangle Every night I go out in my backyard and sit in the dark and watch the skies. Every night I witness multiple UFOs at extremely high altitudes. I'm talking about in the stars. These objects I see are balls of white/yellowish/blueish white light. I live a couple miles away from Nellis AFB and I know the difference between the objects and UFOS. Anyway, last night I was sitting in my backyard and saw with the naked eye three bluish white light objects in the formation of a triangle moving from North to South. I grabbed my binoculars and got a closer look. I can see the three objects quite clearly and I can see the stars in between so I know it wasn't a solid object. They were moving at exactly the same speed. As I was watching them the one in the front dimmed out and then the two behind did also. Shortly after that about 3 mins another two of these showed up traveling the same direction. I grabbed my binoculars and as soon as I locked on them, they dimmed out. Like I said I can go out any night of the week and see these objects. They always appear and dissapear and reappear sometimes showing off by making themselves extremely bright. Sometimes stopping or moving slowly or moving really fast. Thank you ((name deleted));36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
A formation of a dozen independent green lights moves across the night sky over Las Vegas.;2005-08-15 02:00:00;1-2 minutes;A formation of a dozen independent green lights moves across the night sky over Las Vegas. We were outside of our hotel walking back to our room from the pool area.  My wife says, hey, what's that?  I look up in the sky and we all saw about a dozen or so bright neon green-colored lights moving high across the sky.  They appeared to flutter somewhat and moved in what appeared to be a distinct tight formation, although they did move in and out around each other like birds -- the first thought I had was that birds is what they were because of their proximity to one another and the way they moved, but that didn't make sense.  We did not think that they could have been planes, either, because we actually saw a plane flying across another part of the sky at the same time and there wasn't any similarity whatsoever.  We watched them until they were out of sight, about 2 minutes.  None of us had been drinking and we all saw the lights.  I kicked myself afterward because I had been holding my camera in my hand the whole time but I was so astonished when I could not figure out what the lights were that I had forgotten about the camera, and so, took no pictures.  I have always been a skeptic and was rather disturbed when I couldn't figure out what we were seeing.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

I raised my head and tried to get away. Then I saw an image on the wall that caused me to pause: it looked like a microscopic image of blood cells and amoebas moving. I looked at it briefly then continued to struggle. Then I felt as if one of them pushed my head down, and all went dark for a few seconds. When I felt them release me, I saw them move to the outer wall as a bright light shown through the window.

We were able to observe it until we lost it behind a tree and a building. There was no sound.  It moved faster than other celestial objects in the sky (sky was clear - stars plainly visible).  The colors were not similar to colors found on plane markers.  It was extremely bright.  It also did not move west as planets and/or stars would - it was moving south west. This event took place from the back patio, 1st floor, of a common condo complex.  Our view is to the west, overlooking a pool area with other units on the opposite side.

My eyes are drawn to something out of place in the sky above sheep mountain. I stare at the light for a moment, trying to tell if it is a star or not, and then it starts to zigzag in a diagonal direction towards the desert floor. upon completing several complete zig-zags, it shoots off and does a very hard bank upwards in a vector seemingly aimed at a point very high in altitude above the test site. This is the first white dot/sphere I've seen above this area of town.  It was difficult to tell the distance this object was away from me, but I would guess it was over the very forward edge of the restricted airspace in front of the Nevada Test Site and the other military instillations located behind Sheep Mountain  Also, immediately after the light disappeared, I noticed two (airforce?) planes with very powerful strobes fly along sheep mountain towards Nellis Airforce Base.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Lights (red, green, yellow, orange and blue) rotating around a brilliant white light due west of Las Vegas at about 30 degrees.;2007-07-12 01:00:00;2 Hours;Lights (red, green, yellow, orange and blue) rotating around a brilliant white light due west of Las Vegas at about 30 degrees. It initially appeared to be a star or planet due west of Las Vegas at about 30 degrees above the horizon, but closer scrutiny with binoculars and a telescope showed colored lights rotating around  awhite the object.  Colors were red, blue, green, yellow and orange.  While it appeared to be stationary over the two hour period it actually gradually dropped from about 30 degrees to about 10 degrees above the horizon.  I thought it might be a satellite but after checking the orbit speeds and trajectories of the Hubbell satellite and the International space station, it was easy to rule them out.  I also checked stationary weather satellites speeds and orbit and ruled them out.  Whatever this was, it had to be outside the earth's atmosphere and did not appear to be orbitting the earth.  I have never seen a celestial body that had distinquisable lights rotating around it like this object.  If you know what it is, can you tell me?  I have attached 3 photos I took of it with an inexpensive digital camera shooting into the eyepiece of a $100 telescope.  The photos a a bit blurred and the light streaking due to vibration of the telescope.  But at least you can see that there IS Something there and that the colors described a true.  These photos were taken at about 2 am over a 15 minute period.  The two of us watched this object for about 2 hours from 12:30 am to 2:30 am before going to bed. We will be looking for it again tonight.  See Photos attached.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Light beam and saucer seen over strip through random picture;2007-09-07 05:30:00;a second;Light beam and saucer seen over strip through random picture I was driving to work on the morning of September 7th 2007 on the freeway (I15) south and was taking random pictures out side my window while driving to get a view of the strip because of how low the clouds were.  Once I got to work I noticed the pictures I had taken and one of them showed about 10 light beams coming down and then the next showed a beam or a side of a disk saucer. Therefore I did not see it until I looked at the pictures.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
My daughter and I saw a small light flying on the corner of the roof of the Wynn Hotel.;2007-09-15 01:00:00;between 10-15 minutes;My daughter and I saw a small light flying on the corner of the roof of the Wynn Hotel, we were waiting for our bus, across from the Wynn Hotel, it was about 1:00am when I noticed a small round light flying in like a circle on the top corner of the Wynn roof, it was flying in a circle pattern it seemed to do this for about a few minutes, then it flew from the Wynn to across the sky diagonally from the corner of the Wynn to near the hotel Treasure Island back again to the corner of the Wynn Hotel, it this pattern two times then stay again flying  in a small circle on the roof of the Wynn then flew again toward the Treasure Island this time it left.  I'm a mother, I was with my young teen daughter, I don't drink, we were tying to get home and at the bus stop not so late but the bus took awhile,  I was not drinking, it was a weekday(early morning) not the weekend. What I noticed first was that it wasn't a bird because it was a light flying and just one, I asked my daughter maybe it was a promotional thing for the Wynn, but it was just One light, flying there and only at the the corner of that roof ? a few days later I went into the wynn I did want to ask if they had a promotional thing on that night/early morning, felt would have to ask a lot of people first to get to the promotional person, and felt I would sound stupid.

Star-like light in the daytime sky over Las Vegas.;2007-10-14 15:00:00;10 minutes;Star-like light in the daytime sky over Las Vegas. It was a perfectly clear and sunny day. We were sitting poolside at the Bellagio hotel. I had been watching planes come in and out of the airport when I noticed a bright star-like object at about 60 degrees. I pointed it out to a couple of other people in our party, who remarked that it seemed unusual. At first I thought it was a planet or a star, but its rate of motion, although slow, was faster than what I'd expect for a planet or star. It was way too slow to be a satellite. It continued moving in a straight line until it was directly overhead. After that I lost sight of it.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

It started as a faint glow and got brighter than any star in the sky and suddenly flared up into a bright white light and, just as it appeared it resceded to a faint glow and, I could hardly make out the object only for a couple seconds. Like I said it was far away. I'm thinking, and it's only a guess, but, 50 miles away from me. It was traveling straight and away from me. I've seen shooting stars and this definately was not a shooting star, there was no tail. It had no blinking lights to make it out to be a jet liner. It was real interesting to see.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
UFO's practicing with the Thunderbirds?;2008-03-10 13:30:00;10 minutes;UFO's practicing with the Thunderbirds? While eating lunch and watching the Thunderbirds practicing over Nellis AFB, I was at the north end of Hollywood Blvd, which dead ends into Nellis AFB. I watched the Thunderbirds go through practice routines at about the 10:00 position and I noticed small white objects at the 1:30 position.  My first thought was that these were random pieces of paper caught in the updraft of a while wind (or dust devil). I have witnessed this before. These papers were very high in altitude, and hardly visible.  Then I looked back at the 10:00 position to watch the Thunderbirds do a low altitude pass over.  As I was eating I looked back to the 1:30 position to see these objects slowly moving to the NE, and I noticed that there were 6 of these objects the thought that these could be geese flying back north, and I wondered if there was any danger that the aircraft could hit them.  I observed the objects for about 20 seconds, and noticed that the were not flying in any formation and there movement was very slow to the NE. My eyes went back to the 10:00 position, the Thunderbird were doing their 4 aircraft going vertical and spreading out at the apex of their climb, and noticed that the objects were in the same area of the apex of the aircraft. I quickly looked back to the 1:30 position and nothing was there. Then as I looked back, the objects were closer together, moving up and down slightly, and then proceeded to travel to the NW until they went out of sight. Immediately the Thunderbirds landed in a rapid procession.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
White Sphere darts from in front of the moon towards Test Site with possible electronic effects.;2008-04-18 19:55:00;5 sec - Ten minutes?;White Sphere darts from in front of the moon towards Test Site with possible electronic effects. While on the job (which requires both witnesses to be outside for several hours) at approximately 19:55 PM, I noticed at a medium altitude a strange pulsing red dart (I've seen plenty of F-15s, F-18s, even B-1B Spirits while on the job due to the job's location under an Air Force flight path, and this seemed like a military airplane with its lights on) fly at an abnormal (faster than Air Force aircraft normally fly in the area) and leave a strange fog behind it (looked like a vapor trail but was highly visible against a dark sky), and I point this out to the coworker next to me.  He sees it, and we talk for a moment about it, then he turns, yells and points to the moon, upon which I see a white dot of light accelerate from in front of moon north towards the Nevada Test Site.  After traveling several degrees in the vision in just a second or so, it had accelerated to the point it was no longer visible. After this I began marking times using a function on my watch, and at 8:06 I noticed another one of the red darts. During the next hour the sky around our job is filled with air planes and helicopters deviating from the normal flight path into North Las Vegas Airport to circle around the area. When I leave the job for home at around 22:30, I check to see if my laptop (which I don't normally leave in there) was okay, at which point I find the backpack and the laptop to be both hot to the touch (I've never had this problem before), with the laptop already fully powered on. The laptop has only an effective battery life of 70 minutes, and was not at full capacity the last time I used it, which was around 18:00.  Out of curiosity, I touch the back of my hand to the car stereo, and it is also hot to the touch. This is not the first time I've seen white spheres or dots over this part of the city. In fact, this is the third time in less than a year, but the first time I reported the incidents.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
The object  sped through the sky at an extremely high velocity.;2008-04-18 20:00:00;Approximately an hour;The object  sped through the sky at an extremely high velocity. 4/18/2008, 19:58 PST, Las Vegas, Nevada.  I was at work and a co-worker and I happened to be looking at the sky, I looked towards the Moon and a street light was causing me not to be able to see the moon clearly, so I put my hand up in front of my face to block out the light. When I did so, out of the corner of my eye I saw a light moving at very high speeds, when I looked at it, I noticed it was moving at too high of a speed to be any man-made aircraft, not even a jet could fly this fast. Just as soon as I saw the light, it had vanished, towards the mountains in the North.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
PILOT OBSERVATION:  Four lights climb and pace commercial  airline flight.;2008-09-06 03:30:00;10 Min +;Four lights climb and pace commercial  airline flight. Private Pilot ground observation.  Lake Mead Recreation Area  About 8-10 miles East of Hollywood Blvd on Lake Mead Blvd.   United Airlines/US Air 757,767, or Airbus, with Blue underside (body and engines), had departed McCarran IAP (3:15) Aprox. time 270 (west) making slow climbing 180 turn to 90 (east). I have been observing similar lights over the last two years in this area.  The lights have the ability to emulate small aircraft navigation/strobe lights (green/white and red).  When they are no longer visable from cockpit crews the lights return to their normal blury red/white strobe pattern.  I have never observed these lights mess with any commercial or conventional aircraft. The commercial flight is climbing out of Aprox. 17,500 AGL 90 degree heading East over Lake Mead and Est. airspeed at 275-325 knots.  The four lights are 1000-1500 feet apart two lead center with wing men trailing outside and Aprox. 500 AGL over Lake Mead.  The four lights have returned to red/white light pattern as the commercial flight passed overhead.  The Pilot/First officer probably requested a verification from Nellis AFB if they were painting any other aircraft in the area.   Whatever the communication, the four lights went from their position and elevation to the commercial flights elevation/airspeed/position in Aprox. 3-5 seconds and climbed out with them.  One lead light 500 meters off Captain's left window, second lead light 1000 meters off Co-pilots right window with the wing men lights 1000 meters from leaders and off commercial flights wing tips.   Whatever the circumstance it would be safe to say these two pilots probably needed to change their shorts.   This happened between 3:30-3:40 AM.    End of Report.

Bright light moving across the night sky;2009-09-26 19:30:00;30 seconds;Bright light moving across the night sky I was standing outside my neighbor’s garage when I saw a bright light heading from the west-northwest to the east-southeast at a high rate of speed. The object slowed and changed direction once about 30 degrees shortly after it flew over my head. It then Sped up and headed more southeast dimming then disappearing into my horizon. I would estimate the object was at 10 to 15 thousand feet in the air. This light had no strobes and was clearly not a commercial or known military plane, nor do I feel it was a meteor. I know this because of my background in A & P and the fact that the object quickly surpassed a commercial aircraft that was over 30,000 feet in the air (with the usual strobes). This light was brighter than the planet visible at that time in the southeast Las Vegas sky, as I could see both at the same time.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

I watched this while I was driving down the road so I'm not sure how long they were there before I saw them. It was not a firework and it was something I have never seen before.

I saw at least ten of them fly in some sort of formation south then east to west across the north mountain range heading from the Area 51 / Groom Lake region. At first I assumed they were helicopters but they seemed to move too slowly and upon zooming with the 10 X optical zoom and taking stills no structure could be seen. These were shot on auto mode ISO 800 1/30 + 1/25 F4.3 @ 9 megapixels, the camera was a Canon Powershot SX110 IS with 10 X Optical Zoom, a very good piece of consumer kit. I know alot of helicopter flights go out to the Grand Canyon from Vegas but the lights were all the same and moved in a very odd way, bright pulsing white with strobes of red pulsing up and down it seemed (which the stills show). No solid structure can be seen at all, either behind or in front of the lights. I've checked the national weather data for Las Vegas for that day, the official wind direction was from the South South West, these things came from the North and made a turn east.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

A 3-light and a 4-light formation dancing in and out of the Luxor hotel light beam in Las Vegas;2012-02-24 21:35:00;10 minutes;A 3-light and a 4-light formation dancing in and out of the Luxor hotel light beam in Las Vegas Las Vegas, NV 02/24/2012 9:35pm - 9:45pm (approx.10 Minutes+)  I was located on a very high floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas. Me and a friend of mine stayed in a suite with a balcony facing towards the MGM / Luxor hotel. At night the Luxor shines a very bright beam of light into the sky, which originates at the tip of its pyramid structure and goes straight up. We were preparing to go out into the Vegas nightlife. I stood on the balcony and at about 9:35pm I noticed unusual glowing dots in the Luxor light beam at an estimated hight of max. 400-500 meters, maybe closer to ground. There was a shining 3-light and a 4-light formation. They were „dancing“ around each other in the light beam, always keeping some formation. When they moved out of the light beam a few times they were still visible, but barley. Those motions went back and forth into and out of the light beam. Always in a pattern and always in an unnatural movement – up, down, even standing in mid-air, which I with my knowledge only can call unidentifiable. It was a very clear night, no clouds, stars were bright, airplanes and helicopters clearly visible and distinguishable. Yes, there was air traffic from the nearby airport – but by its motion airplanes, helicopters, birds reflecting light, remote-controlled toys like octocopters etc. can be exempt. After 5 minutes of being baffled by it I called my friend outside to the balcony – he confirmed the sighting, but couldn’t explain it to me logically either. After another 5 minutes of watching the spectacle I went inside to get my phone, wanting to film it. As I came back outside those formations were gone, not to be seen again by me that night or the other nights we stayed in Las Vegas.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Intermittent bright red and white stationary lights and super high speed streak of light over mountains, north of Las Vegas;2012-04-19 19:45:00;15 minutes;Intermittent bright red and white stationary lights and super high speed streak of light over mountains, north of Las Vegas At 19:45 I was driving home from work heading north. I noticed three lights above the mountains north of Las Vegas. At first I thought they were fighter jets in formation doing maneuvers but suddenly all the lights disappeared but came back on a few seconds later.  These lights didn’t seem to be moving upon further observation but just lighting up and dimming back down.  With my eyes peeled in this direction of the sky there was sudden streak from west to east lasting only a few seconds and “exceedingly” faster than any plane or shooting star I’ve ever witnessed.  I was on the phone with a friend and describing what I was seeing to him.  I see airplanes in the sky all the time in Vegas but these lights and streak didn’t seem to match anything I see on a normal basis.   After the streak I didn’t anymore lights but still curious I drove west a bit into the desert to get a better vantage point.  That's when I looked up National UFO Reporting Center and called.   As I was calling there was too more stationary brilliant red lights (about 3 times the size of a normal star) that lit up in the same area, one immediately after the other.  Both stayed lit for approximately two to three seconds and then disappeared.  I hung around for another fifteen minutes but saw nothing else. I am a college instructor, and teacher.  This is the first time I’ve ever reported a sighting. I feel what I saw was significantly unique enough to follow through with filing a report.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

I remember the first encounter taking place sometime in early spring 2013. I was driving in my jeep around 7:45 P.M (occasion 1) and in my review (sic.  Rearview)) mirror me and my girl friend saw for about 30 seconds the exact same thing as video 1. Video 1 and two are not my videos but exactly what i have seen on two occasions.  Video two happened about 7 year ago in the same spot in las vegas.  I was driving home around dusk and i fixed on an object and it stood still for about 7 seconds started moving and then disappeared.  I will attach the two videos.  The videos are exactly what i saw. I had a physicist look at the videos and he believes them to be hoaxes.  That is a easy perspective to have from a computer.  I believe these videos deserve a second look. I will attach his E-Mail as well.  Just wanted to share.  Thanks for the great site!    Video 1 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyKjUAxywrE   Video 2 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO49ho_gHAc   physicist response:   Hi, ((name deleted)),   I looked over the videos.  On the short one from China I can’t help much – I don’t see anything in the images that gives me a clue as to what is happening.  It does appear that the shape of the object is constant throughout the video – at least to within the resolution of the video.  However, I would really like to know why the videographer called it UFO with digital FX – makes me wonder what the effects are. On the other (lights in the Vegas night sky), I do have a few comments.  First, the entire clip is being taken with a video-capable camera on a pretty solid tripod, so it isn’t a case of someone pulling out their cell phone to video what they are seeing. Another thing that seems pretty clear is that there are a bunch of objects at a higher angle above ground, and a second, smaller bunch of objects closer to the horizon.  A third thing to note is that the top of the hotel at the right of the image is out of focus.  There is so little difference between focusing at infinity and focusing at, say, 300 feet that if the camera is recording sharp lights, they are probably rather close to the camera, rather than at a large to very large distance.   Finally, if you look closely where the various objects fade out on the left and the right, you can trace out a cone of light in the image. You can’t see the light, but it seems pretty clear that the objects are moving in and out of a cone of l! ight such as might be produced by a flashlight pointing straight up from the ground.  I don’t know just what the objects are (at first I thought clusters of balloons, but they would have to be pretty small to be consistent with the hotel being out of focus. However, I don’t have any hesitation calling this one a fake. Hope these comments help out. I have to say that I enjoyed the lights on the China video.

Line of 9 light orbs hovered over.Las Vegas NV 8/3/13.;2013-08-03 22:00:00;45 minutes;Line of 9 light orbs hovered over.Las Vegas NV 8/3/13. Nine round lights in an almost vertical direction ( 90 degree angle into the sky above) hovered but were mostly stationary over the N/NW part of the city of N Las Vegas.  The lights were equally spaced apart and would get bright and then dim in patterns.  For example, all lights would turn bright together and then dim, whereupon the bottom most light (maybe starting 250 feet above the buildings and homes) would turn a red color, the 2nd through 8th lights would go bright up the almost vertical line of light one by one, successively, after the other until the ninth and topmost light would grow bright red.  I and five other witness watched this for about 45 minutes straight. The patterns of the lights glowing bright white and then fading out almost completely, was constantly changing, almost pulsing at times, and the lights were moving very slowly, not breaking formation  due West.   As we were all viewing this event, a light appeared in the sky in front of us, South of the formation and closer to us.  It shot upwards after appearing and faded out completely. Additionally, closer and to the NW, we observed another bright light appear, and  travel at high speed for a second and disappear.  Appeared high up in space.  To right of the Big Dipper.  We all also observed another shooting light orb appearing out of nowhere and shooting upwards, arcing and disappearing. this was again South of the formation to the North and lower and much closer to our viewing position. Finally the formation moved West at a faster speed, all lights disappearing but one, which proceeded to grow brighter and much bigger.  At peak light intensity it vanished. We could no longer see anything in the sky to the North.  About a minute or less after the final large round light went out, as we were talking about it, we looked to the North East as a huge bright light caught our eye.  It was traveling in a South Easterly direction and appeared to be a large white light traveling very fast.  It was pretty close and low, and large.  Very bright white. It too vanished by going from extremely bright to dim in milliseconds.  Then it was gone. Looked like the large light from the formation, at the end.  Don't know if it was or not. Again six of us observed the light formation for around 45 minutes. We were driving and saw the formation, and stopped near our home to observe it.  So crazy we could not stop watching all of the events.  We have no idea if anyone else around the city saw it, but I am positive others observed it.  It was glaringly not helicopters or planes or flares. It was occurring pretty well in the center of Vegas and North of Vegas proper and before the mountain range.  Lights extended into the sky well above the mountains. We watched the;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

MST. Las Vegas, NV I went out front to smoke a cigarette when I was joined by my mother we noticed 2 lights pulsating all colors of visible light one high and far north the other west was not much higher than the background mountains and was moving slowly south it maintained altitude speed and direction until it crossed into the backyard and was no longer visible due to rooftops and trees.  The first object was moving away and north we determined this by it becoming more and more faint and decending and moving right (north north east) at a slow pace. Seconds after the second object moved out of view a third object just appeared in the same place the second object was sighted it too was pulsating all colors of visible light went from a hover to moving in exactly the same way as the second object same alt., Speed, and direction a civilian Jet flew under the third object in no more than a minute it disappeared in the same place as the second.  At 9:28 P.M. MST the first object fell below the buildings and trees of the city what seemed over Creech AFB. all 3 objects all displayed the same color and flash pattern. All the objects seemed to be a great deal larger than any aircraft in the sky, a plane overtook and passed under object 3 during the sighting. This is not the first time unusual lights have been observed in these places.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

5 bright light to the east of Las Vegas.  Dissipated into the atmosphere.;2018-01-10 18:20:00;10 minutes;5 bright light to the east of Las Vegas.  Dissipated into the atmosphere My car alarm went off.  My neighbors where leaving from across the street.  My son and I went out to check the truck. nothing out by my vehicle, turned around and I saw these bright light gathering together.  I said look look.  The objects followed each other and gathered to same area.  Thoughts was helicopters.  Because they was in the area of the oncoming planes crossing to the sunset landing and the northside landing.  I thought odd.  One object started getting dimmer and went out of the atmosphere and then the other 3 followed.  A minute or so went by and I saw another same bright light coming to the area of the first 4.  It also stopped around the same area of the first 4 and then dimmed as it went out of the atmosphere.    We watched for a long time.  Watched all the planes going towards the sunset runway.  But never saw anymore.  These object was to the east of the city.  South of Nellis air force area.  It was like they was coming into the city, and then not.  Neighbor came back after awhile and they said they saw 4 of the objects when we first saw them.  They too thought helicopters.  They only saw the first 4 before the last showed up;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Bright Orange or Red Light.;2018-07-20 03:50:00;10 seconds;Witnessed a bright orange or red light at around 3:51AM.  I was walking east on Washington and noticed a bright light above the homes and treeline facing almost north east.  The light appeared to be a light flare but the duration was too long and steady to be one.  The event lasted about 10 seconds.  No sound or pulsating lights occurred.  Never seen such an object in the skies before.  I was able to record the phenomenon and it can be clearly seen on video.  I was able to catch the object disappear on video as well.  The object never moved, it stood steady and bright and just went out like a lamp in the sky.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

UFO Sighting in Las Vegas, NV-Spring Valley area;2018-09-25 15:00:00;1 hour;UFO Sighting in Las Vegas, NV - Spring Valley area Tuesday, September 25th, 2018:  Whenever I stand out on my balcony, I get a pretty good view of the mountains going west on the 215 freeway.  I can tell you that I have never seen anything like what I saw today.  I noticed a bright light or reflection of some sort coming from what seems like the edge of one of the mountains.  I called my fiancé out onto the balcony to come take a look, and we immediately started recording. Since we could not zoom in enough to be able to appreciate exactly what it was, we remembered we have high quality binoculars.  We grabbed them and took a closer look.  When we were able to focus on the object, we noticed that it had one large light in the middle, and two smaller ones on each side.  We are not sure if what we saw were 3 separate objects, or if it was just one craft.  However, what we can say is that the object was out in the open at 3:00PM in bright daylight, and these lights were beaming so bright.  It was not a reflection of anything as there is NOTHING else on those mountains. We are about 25 miles away from the location where the object seemed to be, so we got into our car and decided to drive a little closer.  As we started driving, we realized that the closer we got, the object seemed to be less visible.  We pulled into a parking lot, and we were able to grab someone's attention and asked them if they had any idea what the object sitting on the mountain was.  This woman said she has lived in Las Vegas for over 30 years, and has never seen anything like it.  We decided to head back home. Unfortunately, when we got back to our house.  We noticed that there was smoke or dust coming from the area where the object was seen.  We did not capture that on camera.  The object had seemed to move to the left, and was still a bit visible. However, left a cloud of dust or smoke behind.  We went out onto our balcony later that night, and this morning, and there is nothing out there now.  Not sure what we saw, but we have footage and pictures which we will be uploading to YouTube. ((NUFORC Note:  Good photo shows 3 lights, sitting on a distant ridgeline.

It was moving towards the southeast.  As it continued on its path it slowly disappeared as if it turned off the lights.  When I looked at my friend she had noticed it also!  She’s a flight attendant and for me I’m a student pilot, we noticed that it didn’t look like a plane or a drone. we’re not sure if it was a meteor, if it was it was the slowest one I’ve ever seen and it didn’t leave a trail like a shooting star.

Nighttime sighting of unusual &quotlight&quot display;2020-04-01 21:30:00;45 minutes;Nighttime sighting of unusual &quotlight&quot display DATE: 4/1/2020 LOCATION: NW Las Vegas, NV TIME: 9:30 pm – 10:15 pm  On this night, it was very windy here in Las Vegas.  At, or around 9:30 p.m. this evening, I was taking my dog out, as we normally do each night before bed.  The sky was clear, the wind gusting heavy at times.  I glanced around the clear sky, taking note of the “Little Dipper” and “Orion” constellations above me. It was at this time that I noticed a very bright light in the sky, just to the west of “Orion’s belt.”  At first, I thought it may be the lights of an approaching plane, however the only sound that could be heard was the blowing wind.  There were several factors that kept me focused on this particular subject – First, it was the single brightest object in the night sky, including the moon. Second, to the naked eye, there appeared to be a “swirling” of lights, flashing at times with a Blue tint at the outer edges. Third, the subject did not appear to be moving, but continually would alternate between bright flashes then dim, then flash, repeating for several minutes. After watching this display for several minutes, I knew that what I was looking at was not a plane, not a helicopter, not a weather balloon.  It was not a planet, as I could also see “Venus” in the Western sky, but this object was significantly brighter and much, much closer and lower in the sky.  I grabbed my cell phone and proceeded to record several video clips, (in total, over10 mins) in which the bright light continues to flash and dim the “light display” for lack of a better term. My girlfriend, who also lives with me, came into the yard at this point and also noticed the “object.”  She instantly recognized the “light display” and noted that there were no sounds, other than the wind.  We both continued to watch and record the object.  At approximately 10 pm, I went inside and placed my cell phone on the charger as the battery was low.  I returned to the backyard (noting the time on the stove before I stepped out) and used my gf’s phone to record another video.  It was at this time that I noted the object was now much lower on the horizon line and appeared to be moving further away to the general West/NorthWest. I decided to get into my car and see if I could follow or track the object somehow.  I proceeded North on El Capitan Way for 2 blocks, then turned West onto Buckskin Ave and continued West until the intersection of Buckskin Ave and N. Grand Canyon Dr, where I turned right (North) and continued until the intersection of W. Gowan Rd where in the literal “blink” of an eye, the object was gone. I returned home and noted the time was 10:20 pm.  I decided to review the video footage we had both captured on our cell phones and was shocked to see what we were looking at.  I have never had a personal experience with “U.F.O.” before today, but after seeing this footage I believe the anomaly I have captured warrants further discussion/review with people who have more familiarity with this subject matter.  I look forward to speaking further with someone from your organization.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
2 Parades of satellites, 40 total, west to east across Las Vegas sky.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-14 04:35:00;25 minutes;2 Parades of satellites, 40 total, west to east across Las Vegas sky Out walking dog in darkness, looked up to see what appeared to ba a satellite traveling west to east, but then noticed another following in it's same path about 5 arc seconds behind, then looked west to see another and another ( all coming out of a small cloud formation floating by.  There were 2 that were out of this singular formation as if slowly passing the object in front of it.  I ran into house to grab my Celestron Binocs to see if I could detect a shape - I could not as if they were too high up, too small, or in orbit... however they were all very bright, slightly less than Sirius.  After what appeared to be the last one, I continued to watch the sky and about 1 minute later, another series of these objects started to come over, about the same distance in between, but slightly faster. The path of these new objects were also west to east but slightly farther south in the sky. There was about 8 to 10 in total, in this second grouping, then a g! ap of maybe 30 seconds and then a very bright object, traveling much faster seemed to be trying to catch up. All these objects were now fading into the gathering light of dawn in the eastern sky. I tried to photograph these objects with my cell phone but it was inadequate to catch more than just a few seconds of one object. The dark sky was very still with no other objects noticed while viewing the above mentioned ones.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

I was at Bonanza and MLK looking towards Sunrise Mountain when all of the sudden 4 orangish lights flew from my right to my left at a speed that was obviously too fast for any plane.  I thought it might be a reflection in the glass I was looking through but the objects went behind the mountain not to mention there were no vehicles or anything that could have caused a reflection at that moment.  I was really hoping someone else saw what I saw this morning.  If there are any survailence cameras facing Sunrise Mountain they may have caught the objects.

Light Above Plane Following Flight After Takeoff - Stops and Suspends In Air Before Vanishing;2020-10-09 19:19:00;~18 seconds;Light Above Plane Following Flight After Takeoff - Stops and Suspends In Air Before Vanishing I am a satellite imagery analyst and have a background in remote sensing/drone flight and collection . I was walking in the evening when I two lights moving in the sky at approximately 19:19 on Oct 9, 2020.  I did a double-take because I live a few miles from the Las Vegas commercial airport and frequently see planes multiple times a minute during take-off and landing.  I also am familiar with the light pattern planes flash when in the sky.  This caught my eye because a plane had just taken off and looked relatively large due to the proximity as it had lifted off the ground maybe 10 seconds prior.  I stopped because there was a bright circular white light I instinctively thought it was a star, but it was directly above the plane moving at the same angle and speed which I have never seen before and instinctively raised an alarm in my head.  I know planes take off somewhere between 130 to 150 mph due to my background and based on the size of the light.  From where I was standing the light looked to be roughly 3x higher on the horizon as I couldn't make a reasonable guess on its height.  The plane was approx. the size of a fingernail from where I was standing while the light was the size of a star in the sky so the scale and speed to which it was moving is a conundrum to me.  My biggest question is how and why two objects(plane and one unknown) were on top of each other. Basic calculations from where I was and the airport takeoff are approx. 6.5 to 7 miles to the east of me for the plane.  Approx. 4 seconds after I noticed the plane and the other object in the sky, the unknown star looking object stopped completely and was isolated/suspended in the air while the plane continued on its path.  After approx. 2 seconds after the light stopped it started to dim to the point where it was barely visible in the span of approx. 2 more seconds. Still suspended in the air the dim light sat for approx. another 5 sec and increased its brightness again for approx. 2 sec. after another approx. 2 seconds it dimmed again and I looked away to search for any context as to what, where, how it could be, I looked away for less than a second, and when I looked back the object had vanished.  Given the speed and rate of the object’s path earlier and that it was somewhat easy to spot in the sky, I can not fathom how an object can completely disappear in the matter of a second after being stationary for so long.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

I live not far from the airport and am accustomed to watching aircraft of all sorts flying over, landing, etc. I've never seen nor experienced anything like what I just saw.  I went out to smoke a cigarette and from my third story balcony I saw three orange lights in the sky to the direct north. The lights were in a weirdly perfect triangular pattern but moving away from each other. The top and brightest light was moving northeast, the bottom right was moving due east, and the left bottom light appeared stationary. The bottom left light disappeared just as I was taking my first picture. The other two lights kept moving for several seconds until the bottom right disappeared.  After about thirty seconds longer, the top light also disappeared leaving no indication they'd ever been there.  This happened around 6:40 PT.  Weather conditions were clear sky, nothing unusual weather wise.  Address of sighting was Boulder highway and east Tropicana, Las Vegas 89122.  Photos I could snap are attached but it all happened in less than 90 seconds so I couldn't get better ones.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
I saw a light that moved side to side and up and down then flashed bright with a baby blue color and a hazy blue aura around it.;2021-05-26 21:17:00;20 seconds;I saw a light that moved side to side and up and down then flashed bright with a baby blue color and a hazy blue aura around it. DATE/TIME & LOCATION: On May 26,2021 around 9:00pm, on the road 'NorthShore' while heading North. Coming up to the road 'Lake mead' heading to Vegas.   My girlfriend and I were heading back to Las Vegas after a day at Lake Mead. It was dark out and I was looking up at the sky/stars. I noticed a star like light that started to slowly glide across the sky. Regular white color light at first.  SIGHTING: I saw a light gliding across the sky for around 10 seconds. I saw it begin moving to the right then it started to move left really quickly then moved right again, that’s when it looked like it was ascending to the point it looked like a star, it got really small. Then it descended back down and while doing so it flashed so bright with a baby blue looking color and hazy bluish aura around it. For a brief second, it was the brightest looking light in the sky. I then saw it keep gliding across the sky slowly for about 6 seconds then it quickly ascended again and while doing so it flashed 2 times like a camera flash, with a baby blue color. It then seemed to disappear into the dark sky. After about 2 seconds I saw it flash 2 more times with a baby blue color and it went up so high into the sky that it just looked like a star. I kept looking at it and it seemed like it just faded away.  Number of objects: 1  My conclusion: I have came to the conclusion that what I saw was not anything Earth like. Not a satellite, not a plane or helicopter. Not a drone or military training act. The way that it moved left and right seemed like it just moved in the direction it wanted to without any effort, to put an example its as if it was a cursor on a computer, it moved so easily and quickly, side to side then up and down. It also didn’t have the flashing lights that planes and helicopters have. The only times it flashed was when it moved up then down, other than that it just looked like a star in the sky that was gliding. And the fact that in the end of all of it, it looked like it had just faded away into nothing. And it couldn’t have been a comet, its movements and bright flashing several times was nothing like it.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
