Air Force jets chased triangular UFO over Las Vegas, NV. one mile west of Nellis AFB;1992-09-15 19:00:00;15 seconds;Air Force jets chased triangular UFO over Las Vegas, NV. one mile west of Nellis AFB While living in Las Vegas, NV. less than one mile west of Nellis AFB where my husband was stationed, I stepped out into our back yard one evening during early fall around 20:00. It was dusk. I looked straight overhead as I heard jet engine sounds. Two fighter jets were chasing a triangular UFO at fairly low altitude. The shape of the UFO was not clearly defined due to it being dusk, but the object appearing dark,had faint,fairly large circular lights in the shape of a triangle. Three in back and one in front. The object was not much larger than the jets. I called Nellis afterwards to report it, but they seemed uninterested and said there are no UFO's.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Black triangle seen in 1994 over Las Vegas. 911 called.;1994-06-01 21:30:00;8 minutes;Black triangle seen in 1994 over Las Vegas. 911 called. I am reporting this today because of all the attention UFO's have been getting lately.  I had always thought that my story would be irrelevant because it was only a sighting, but after watching a UFO show on the Travel Channel, I'd report my experience just to have it on record. It was around June of 1994 and i was living in Las Vegas in an apartment complex on Desert Inn and Pecos.  I was living with my girlfriend named Dana Scavone at the time and was a dice dealer. I got off from work at 8pm and went to the apartment.  It's been a long time so the exact time of the occurance escapes me, but i want to say around 9:30 pm or somewhere in that time frame.  I smoked outside, and we lived on the second floor of our apartment complex, and stepped outside of the apartment door onto the balcony, lit a cigarette, and as i was smoking the cigarette i happened to look up...and that's when i saw a HUGE, black, perfectly triangled craft slowly moving across the sky making no noise whatsoever.  The craft couldn't have been more than 1000 ft. up, moving from the northwest towards the southeast.  This craft was black, had no bright lights, but did have some kind of circular metallic object in the bottom side middle of the craft. I looked in awe for a few moments and then yelled for my girlfriend Dana to come out and look at what i was seeing. Dana came outside and looked up and said, Oh my God, what is that?.  I replied, I think it's a UFO. I then ran into the apartment, grabbed the telephone and dialed 911.  The operator answered and i proceeded to tell her exactly what i was looking at.  I said to the 911 operator, I am looking at a huge black triangle in the sky right now as we speak, and it's flying right over my apartment or something to that effect.  The 911 operator was not mad at me as i had thought they might be for calling in a UFO (Which i didn't even think really existed), but was more interested in the idea that i was really looking at a UFO.  I think i asked her if she had heard aything from other callers, and she replied that she had not.  Then one of us decided that i should contact McCarran airport or Nellis AFB to see if they might have anything on ra! dar to explain the craft.  I remember just saying something like, Maybe you guys should contact Nellis and see if they have something because i am definitely seeing a huge black triangle fly right over my apartment. I hung up the phone and watched the craft continue on towards the Southeast as it climbed and eventually disappeared out of sight. I heard no noise.  I am absolutely sure of what i saw.  And if you can get the 911 audio, you'll clearly see how startled i was. This event happened.  This was not an airplane.  This was a triangle.  It moved slowly, without sound, directly over my head.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
I told the 911 Operator that i was looking at a huge black triangle.;1994-07-15 09:00:00;6-7 mins;I told the 911 Operator that i was looking at a huge black triangle. I am reporting my sighting now rather than when it occurred because i am much older and really do not care anymore what people think of me as far as being crazy or weird. This sighting was also called in to 911 dispatch as it happened, so there is evidence of my reporting it. This sighting occurred in the Spring of 1994... It was a nice evening in Las Vegas and my girlfriend and i had been hanging out in our apartment. We both smoked cigarettes and i had decided to go outside to smoke this time. We were on the second floor and it had a railing right outside of our front door and i leaned on the railing with my forearms and lit up my cigarette. I had taken a drag or two when i just happened to look up at the sky at my 2 o'clock position and saw this enormous black triangled craft float overhead approximately 2000 feet up.  The craft moved at a slow and steady pace from right to left.  If it had been a plane it would have fallen out of the sky.The craft made no noise and was PERFECTLY triangular. I yelled for my girlfriend Dana to come outside.  When she came out i pointed to the craft and asked her, what does that look like to you?.  She replied, Oh my god, look at that thing, it's huge!.  I was so shocked by what i was seeing that all i could think to do was run in, grab the wireless phone, and call 911. When the dispatcher came on the line i told her this, I can't believe what we're seeing, my girlfriend and i are looking at a huge black triangle floating over my apartment right now!. The dispatcher, not apparently upset that i called, said, really?  You're looking at a UFO?.  Something to that effect.  I told her i was not kidding that my girlfriend was right there looking at it with me.  I also told her i wasn't on drugs or alcohol or anything like that.  I was just witnessing an unidentified flying object. She told me there were no other reports of the craft and that maybe i should try contacting Nellis Air Force Base.  She also was genuinely interested in what the craft looked like and what it was doing. She never dispatched any cops or anything. My girlfriend and i then proceeded to watch the craft climb slowly up and away. The craft never made any sudden moves or turns or attempted to speed up until the very end of the sighting, it looked as if it was moving faster as it gained more altitude up and away. That's my story.  It isn't the most exciting, but it was a real triangled craft plain as day and there is a 911 call out there with my voice reporting it. I just can't remember the exact date.  But i'm sure there has to be a way to find the recording. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that date of event is approximate.  Most 9-1-1 facilities recycle their magnetic tapes on a regular basis, so the recording probably has been erased.  PD));36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Large hovering invisible craft houvering in mid air at least triangle 300 yards.;1995-08-13 18:30:00;5 minutes;Large hovering invisible craft houvering in mid air at least triangle 300 yards. I like this report to be taken seriously for it was reported on the news in vegas about 7 or 8 years ago.  I happened to have a perfect view.  What happened was impossible and I would like to talk about it more.  You can call me at 847-((number deleted)). Please contact me this has been disturbing me for a very long time and I need to talk about it.  Thanks  Hello my name is ((name deleted)) this is a real documented case of something very strange that took place.  No one knows or is willing to talk about it now.  It was documented on the 10:00 news in Las Vegas about 7 years ago.  The Government said nothing they neither denied it or tried to cover it up. I along with several friends had a perfect view.  However I did not see the entire outcome this just ending.  If I saw the whole thing I think I would have locked me up in a mental hospital.  Who knows maybe it affected me more than I thought.  And that is why I'm acting so strangely.   My friend or co-worker saw the whole thing and that was the last day I saw him.  He never came back to work because it affected him so much.  All you had to be doing was looking south at the right time and you would have seen an amazing sight.  What I saw lasted only several minutes and the main display only a few seconds.  It will be a day that I will never forget.  I believe it took place August 13 on a Saturday night around 8:30pm what year I don't remember anymore.  It was about 6 or 7 years ago so the date can easily be checked out.    At any rate I was pulling into the showboat hotel.  I was driving a cab at the time so you know I was completely aware of my faculties.  It has just turned dark. Right around 9:30 I saw my friend or co-worker standing over his van looking directly south.  Normally my first instincts would be to ignore him and get into the cab line as quickly as possible.  But he looked like he might be in trouble so I pulled over got out of my cab and asked him if everything was all right.  He said yes but look at this.    I looked where he pointed and I said so what there's nothing there.  Everything was pitch black all you could see was a nice clear sky and the stars.  You could see forever that's how clear the night was.  Then all of a sudden something happened.  I thought I saw a shooting star. Beautiful crystal clear white lights shooting straight up like something you might see at the end of a comet.  Little tiny crystals or like very tiny little white stars.  Millions of them shooting straight up about as wide as normal full size airplane from wing to wing.  They were so clear you could see every one of them.  Like I said I my first thought was like it was a shooting star.  But then I said wait a second this thing is going straight up beginning from several miles up.  A shooting star goes across not up that defies the laws of physics.  It went up for maybe half a mile before the lights started to fade a way.  When I saw that I went into a state of shock.  When the lights fizzled away a tiny ball appeared about the size of a helicopter.  Difficult to tell the size because of the distance between us maybe 20 miles or so.  The ball hovered and from that ball more light appeared like the first white light.  But this time the color of the light was red very bright red.  It came shooting straight out towards us.  It came outwards and moved down at the same time.  And when that light sequence faded another ball appeared just like the last ball.  Now there are two balls at least 300 yards apart.  Now more red light appeared the same as the other red lights.  But these shot straight across.  And when those lights faded away another ball appeared.  The three balls formed a perfect triangle.  The crystal lights that appeared like I explained did it precise formation.  Extremely amazing thing. Now you have three orange balls about the size of helicopters hovering for several minutes.  The more you stared into this thing the more you thought you saw an out line of  a ship.  But you couldn't be sure.  Then the lower right ball started to rotate and all three balls vanished and that was all I saw. I discussed it with my friend and we saw the exact same thing.  But he saw the beginning, which I did not.  He said the lights came down from the stars.  He was so scared he took the rest of the night of and I never saw him again.    It was on the ten o'clock news.  They did a short section on it.  With no answers then at the end of the news they said it was Elvis coming down to the mgm.   A lot of people who saw it convinced  themselves that it was all a fire works display.  But there was a problem with that.  The first problem was that it was completely silent.  The second problem was that the part I saw started half way up the earths atmosphere and was amazingly clear.  To this day I can't watch a fireworks display because it's way to primitive.  The next day no one would talk about it especially the news network.  When I told them I had a perfect view of it they just didn't want to hear about it.  Whatever this thing was it was huge.  The government can't hide things forever.  Eventually one time somebody will have no choice but to listen to the Aliens when they come. I need to talk about this please contact me at 847-((number deleted)) or e-mail me at ((e-address deleted)).  I know Aliens exsist and I belief that this is a bigger cover up than Roswell.

I seen something at night outside of Las Vegas. In short, this whatever it was, was silent, in what seemed to be in the shape of a tria;1997-05-17 03:30:00;5mins;I seen something at night outside of Las Vegas. In short, this whatever it was, was silent, in what seemed to be in the shape of a triangle, with one light in the front and two lights on the side. It came fast and left fast all within maybe 5 minutes. It hovered right behind my car almost over my car with no lights. It was so close to my car I mean maybe 5 feet or closer then dissappeared completely. I was driving back home to Utah from Las Vegas with my friend in the middle of the night. She fell asleep, I noticed some lights quite a bit away in my rear view mirror, it looked like maybe lights from trucks, I wasnt concerned until I looked again and they were closer. It seemed that whatever it was, was approaching fast so I decided to go a little faster. It was pretty much flat land and I could see for a long distance, there was no other vehicles on the road. I looked again in the mirror and I saw three lights one in front of the other two in the shape of a triangle. Strange feeling of no one around even though this was behind me. I dont know what obsessed me to roll the window down I guess to look without out the reflection of the windows to see it. I heard nothing it was silent all but my car. It was right behind me now and this strange feeling was stronger, and I looked back again and it was black like the night with no stars though, like it had its lights off hovering over my car. I seen a diesel coming on the other side of the highway and I felt relieved and I looked back again and it was gone. I shook my friend, and pulled the car over and told her what happend, I told her we were outside Nellis AFB and maybe someone was playing some kind of sick joke on me, never once thinking it might be a ufo until I seen it tonight on the discovery channel. That feeling I had that night came over me again and I dont know what to do or if it might help, but I seen this!, I dont have any idea what it could be and if it was a ufo. I didnt send this in earlier, because for one I didnt know who I should tell and second I didnt want my family and friends to think I was one of those people in them magazines that think they have seen a ufo. Mainly because I didnt and still might not believe it was.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Triangular object travelling slow, and low to the ground;1998-07-31 03:30:00;3-4 minutes;Triangular object travelling slow, and low to the ground I was driving on my way outside of Las Vegas when I stopped to check my back tire. I got out my car, and three bright lights caught my eye.  I looked up and saw this triangular shaped object travelling only about 200-300 feet off the ground.  The three lights were at each corner, and it made absolutely NO sound.  It was going South East at about 35-55 km/m.  Very slow, (not fast enough for an aiplane with wings to fly properly).  It seemed to defiy the laws of Physics AND gravity. Completely soundless, it just seemed to travel nice and calmly away from me until I couldn't see it anymore.  It had to be some kind of aircraft whether it be alien or American.  I was amazed. I could only hope that someone else saw this thing or anything similar.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Came over Mountain to East which has Antenni and banked to South and flew just below broken cloud cover.  It had no running lights but ;1998-12-06 18:25:00;5 minutes;Came over Mountain to East which has Antenni and banked to South and flew just below broken cloud cover.  It had no running lights but a few dim lights along the leading edge. It was more delta shaped as opposed to a triangle. No noise, no running lights and fast for its size. It was real big. I first thought it was a commercial craft in trouble. But I heard nothing so far in local news. I was out smoking during the Dish feed of X files. I normally scan horizon for air craft since we are close to the air port. The cloud cover was broken and at medium height. There was a wind and sure was cold. It had snowed that morning. I looked to the east where normally lights from the mountain can be seen and aircraft turn for one of the approaches to Las Vegas. This craft was moving below cloud cover at this point and upon clearing the mountain made a immediate bank to the left which is south. This got my attention. It has big and I could not have missed it. There were lights on the leading edge but not running lights. These were dim like seeing interior house lights at a distance. The lights of the city reflected off the bottom of the craft. It was big and it was moving fast. I called to my wife who was in the kitchen to come out and see this. There are a few houses blocking the view in that direction so we waited for it to come out. It appeared to have gained altitude and was right below the clouds now and dimly the outline could be seen. The outline was white like a cloud moving fast or like a high speed aircraft which causes condensation when cutting through the air doing abrupt manuvers. The craft continued to the south and west then went out of sight. I am surprised that no one else saw it since it did not appear on the tv or news.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Boomerang  shaped  object  blended  in  with  the night  at least a mile long and about four stories high with 6 or 8 engith;2000-06-30 02:30:00;45 sec;Boomerang  shaped  object  blended  in  with  the night  at least a mile long and about four stories high with 6 or 8 engith I was setting out on the balcony on the 26th floor of Binions Casino around 2:30a.m. having a cigar taking abreak from gambling.  My wife was resting on the bed.  I noticed a light from the corner of my left eye and thought that it was a jet landing at NELIS AIR FORCE BASE then I noticed a second then a third then maybe 4 or 5 more, but then I noticed it turning towards Downtown L.V. and that it wasn't planes of any kind and that it was huge, by huge I mean at least a mile long and I think about 4 stories high and it blended in with the night.  The way it turned or banked to the right I could tell that the lights that I saw where engines because of the way it was banking I could tell the shape and almost size of it.  I was out of my chair while it went behind Fitzgealds Casino for about 3sec. and came back into view going over downtown L.V. heading west slowly I felt like I could touch it but it was wishful thinking I guess because I believe in U.F.O.s since around 1953 when my mother and I first saw our first U.F.O. in Cleveland OH. off Lake Erie from Canada, but thats another story.   But back to Las Vegas, I was so excited that I yelled to my wife to come here quick which she did and I asked her to look out in front of her and tell me what you see and she replied something dark and looked smoky or misty like a silk sheet blowing in the wind. The reason I asked her what she saw was so that I wouldn't influence her in any way. The reason she didn't see the lights or engines was because the thing leveled off. To me when it leveled off it looked like some kind of cloak like on the t.v. show Star Trek. It went right over the Stratosphere Casio. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

It seemed to just glide, flying silently through the air. There was a full moon, but it was the bright lights of the casino that made it visable.  We could see evenly spaced dark circles on it's wings.  We lost sight of the object after only 5-7 seconds because of the lights in the parking lot.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Classic V shaped formation;2003-10-17 23:40:00;1-2 minutes;I witnessed classic V shaped formation of 5-7 dim, orange-amber like lights, traveling directly in a straight line from east to west. One in the front (lead) and 2-3 lights evenly spaced from one another, down each side. I was smoking a cigarette in the front of my house while watching a bird, for a few seconds, fly towards the east. When I lost sight of the small bird, I was directly facing the eastern horizon. I immediately saw a small patch of red light (similar to a laser pointing pen) piercing through the eastern sky (approx. 3-5 miles away). The patch of red light was at first (5-10 seconds) small in size similar to the front lights of an approaching commercial aircraft at that distance. After about 10 seconds, I was able to make out a perfect V shape outline of the craft with 5-7 semi-circles.  I don't remember the altitude of the lights my best guess is it was around 2000-3000 feet (?). To make a short story even shorter, the object became larger and larger as it flew closer to where I was standing. It peaked in size about a quarter of a mile away from me (about one-third,maybe one-fourth the size of the belt of Orion). At that point I was able to look directly underneath it. The lights were no longer semi in shape but full, orange-amber in color with a slight white-yellow haze. At that point I could no longer make out the lights original red outline.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

SIGHTED IN LAS VEGAS DESERT.....;2005-02-18 03:00:00;8 minutes;SIGHTED IN LAS VEGAS DESERT..... It was late (3:00 am) my friend and I were out in the desert when we saw a bright light in the sky, the light lit up the area where we were standing almost as if a huge camera were to take a picture and that is how you would imagine the flash to be like. immediatly after the huge, bright flash of light we looked up to see if there was a police helocopter with his spot light on us, but there was complete silencen and darkness and our eyes were felt blinded for a moment like when you look directly into a cameras flash . about 20-30 seconds later as we were looking up to the sky to our amazement we saw a triangular shaped light it looked like a purple neon ligh aprox. 10ftx10x10ft it was directlt above us (but high as a low plane would appear) then it darted accross the sky super, super fast and stopped suddenly just before some mountains that were about a mile away it hovered for3-5 seconds and it dissapeared it did not seem to fly away it appeared to simply dissapear.  We left the area both freaked out we never thought about telling anyone for the fear of sounded crazy, until a friend of ours told us about this web site, I have never seen any thing like that in my life and I hope I never do again!

Alot of activity north of Las Vegas;2005-03-09 22:15:00;45 minutes;Alot of activity north of Las Vegas I went out star gazing last night (3-9-05) with binoculars. After looking at Orion for 1/2 an hour I started looking NNE. I was just staring into the dark night and a few faint starts when I saw a small red light moving.  I tracked it for about 10 seconds then I noticed it another red light just like it moving in the same direction but slower, like the first one caught up with it. Then after passing it the first object came almost to a stop made a small maneuver then zoomed past the second slower object it just passed. Then it slowed down while moving back across the sky a little then doing the same thing, turning around.  This went on for a while back and forth, also the little red lights would seem to hover or stand still periodically, and get super fast for a few seconds before returning to that same path they were on. It was like they were on a patrol.  After about 30 minutes of this a third red light appeared, but only moving faster in one direction (west) then disappearing, not flying so far I couldn’t see, but completely vanishing!  After 40 minutes the two original objects disappeared. While staring into my binoculars at the same area and slowing scanning back and forth I noticed a small bluish-white light moving west. I track the object that was moving faster than the 2 red objects earlier. Then it started getting dimmer and vanished. It took about 2 or 3 seconds for it to fade away.  I stood there staring at the same area with goose bumps all over my body. All I could see was dark night and a few faint stars. No with my lenses glued to that area nothing was moving. Then what looked like three stars in a triangular pattern in the night sky suddenly started moving... south and fast! I tracked the 3 bluish white lights for about 20 seconds then 1 by 1 each dot/object disappeared, faded, vanished. I then threw my binoculars in my car, got it and took off.

Reflective triangular vehicle over Las Vegas.;2007-01-01 20:00:00;2 minutes;Reflective triangular vehicle over Las Vegas Early evening in January or February 2007 I was on the back of my parked tow truck looking up.  It was a clear night without a moon, and you could see the stars fairly well.  I was not on rotation for any calls, so I had parked in the parking lot of a local community college.  As I was lying there looking up, I realized that I was looking at a perfect reflection of myself and my truck.  There was no sound other than normal street sounds.  Once I realized that I was looking at something moving above me I noted the following: 	It was triangular in shape with no lights and no obvious mode of how it was moving.  It was traveling very slowly.  If I were to guess I would say it was going about 5 mph.  I would say it was less than 200 feet above me.  In fact, I felt that I could have touched it if I had stood on top of my truck cab.  Of course, I did not do that as I have no idea what this thing is.  As it moved past me to the end of the vehicle the mirror effect made it all but invisible.  There were no lights on the back of it.  The height of it was exceedingly difficult to discern as you could not really see what I would assume to be the edges of it. 	This area is near an Air Force base so at the time I figured it must be a new weapon of some sort.  I did mention it to the dispatcher at the time, but they laughed it off.  I have not seen this particular type of vehicle since.  Although I have seen other very strange craft throughout the Las Vegas area.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Two crafts flying from Area 51 towards Nellis Air Force Base within 5 minutes of each other.;2007-03-13 01:20:00;0-10 mins.;Two crafts flying from Area 51 towards Nellis Air Force Base within 5 minutes of each other. Two of my friends and I were laying on my trampoline in my backyard around 1:20 AM in Las Vegas, NV. We were talking and just looking at the stars when I noticed this odd formation of lights moving across the sky. There were three clusters moving together- the main cluster was a V shape and the two other clusters were slanted lines coming from the sides of the V’s. They seemed to kind of float like a sting-ray would underwater. I pointed the lights out to my two friends. I pointed out that it was coming from where “Area 51” is supposed to be and one friend also pointed out that it was moving towards Nellis Air Force Base.  Soon after, an airplane left McCarran airport and we compared the two. The UFO was completely silent and seemed to float and flutter while the airplane made a lot of noise and the body was completely visible. Both objects seemed to fly at the same pace and altitude. About a minute after the airplane went by, I noticed another UFO flying a very similar route as the first, except this UFO had no lights and was seemingly transparent. At times it was a dark brown/green color, but mostly the same shade as the night sky. When it flew over stars, it was more visible and the stars seemed to change a little bit. This UFO was going a bit faster than the first and was also completely silent. Unfortunately, only one friend noticed it when I pointed it out.  Friend A, who saw both crafts, believed the first UFO was one object. I, however, believe the two smaller clusters (both made up of about 3 to 4 lights) were just flying extremely close to the main cluster- as if protecting. The cluster to the right seemed to be a little behind when I first noticed, then sped up a little- as if to catch up with the other two crafts. He hadn't seen it before that moment, but has researched UFOs for some time.  Note: At my location, the routes of the crafts and of the airplane that left McCarran airport would intersect, making an X. Hence, they flew from and towards different directions.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Myself, and two police officers, observed a flying triangle flying over us in the Las Vegas sky.;2007-09-27 20:00:00;20 seconds;Myself, and two police officers, observed a flying triangle flying over us in the Las Vegas sky. During the evening hours on Thursday, Sept 27, 2007, at about 2000 hrs, I was working as a security officer in downtown Las Vegas.  About 50 feet to my right, two Las Vegas police officers had someone in custody, possibly for illegal drugs.  My eyes were directed upwards and I observed an aircraft streaking overhead.  The flight pattern resembled a conventional aircraft, but this aircraft was a perfect triangle in shape. I have never seen a triangular shaped aircraft.  The next day, my friends told me that it was probably the latest in Stealth technology.  This craft had three lights, one at each end of the triangle and one light in its mid-center.  I glanced toward the police officers, and their attention was also directed towards the object.  One of them said, Wow, look at that.  They then turned back to the subject they had in custody.  As the object passed, two very bright white lights were flickering at the rear of the craft.  I don't believe I heard any noise emitting from the aircraft.  I am not able to accurately describe the size of it or how high it was in the sky.  I was not able to confer with the two police officers about further descriptions because they were busy.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

We came to a corner and we stopped to look at the constellation of Orion’s Belt and not even 10 seconds later we both saw a dark triangular shaped object slowly floating right below the constellation with anywhere from 5 to 8 small dim lights that formed a V shape.   The lights appeared gold at first but as it went away they appeared almost blue.  The size of the lights were comparable to that of the stars in the sky. The object was about 2 to 3 inches in size in the sky.  The sound that came from the object was a low pulsating humming sound.   The object was headed south and it looked as if it broke it pieces for a second but then it was definitely intact, when it made a sudden right turn to the west and then rolled over and went to the southwest and was suddenly out of sight but we could still hear its distinct humming sound.   We turned around and ran west down the sidewalk and turned left(southwest) onto the next street but we would not see or hear the object after looking for about five minutes.  During all this we seen many planes in the sky and that made it easy to compare the characteristics of the object to the planes.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Triangle shaped craft over Nevada Highway plus other red light craft;2008-10-29 19:00:00;~3 hours;Triangle shaped craft over Nevada Highway plus other red light craft First of all, we have never officially reported this sighting to anyone before.  We just told friends and family who all looked at us with scepticism.  After watching a UFO special where the reports on objects seen were very similar I decided to write a report. We are Australians.  (My husband and I and a close friend.)  We were traveling by RV from Oregon to Las Vegas in October 2008.  On the day in question, we were driving from Mono Lake to Vegas and cut across to Highway 95.  On the way to 95 we blew a tyre which had to be changed.  This delayed us so by the time we got to highway 95 it was getting dark.  We stopped for gas then continued south. The map showed a large military base to the east of the highway.  I joked with the others saying 'wouldn't it be fun if we saw a UFO around here?'.  In all our USA travels over 20 years, we'd never seen a UFO before.  We laughed about it and kept going south.  It had become completely dark and I estimate it was around 7 or 8pm. My husband was driving the A class RV (bus style front with huge windscreen).  We were going fairly slow enjoying the drive - normal amount of traffic.  I was in navigator seat and our friend was behind on the couch.  My husband who is quite observant, was looking out the window and at the stars as we drove.  It was a clear night and stars were clearly visible. A few minutes later he slowed right down.  He was looking up through the windscreen and said 'the stars have all disappeared.  Do you see that above us?'.  I looked up and our friend looked out the side window.  We all saw that the stars were no longer visible.  We pulled over to the side of the road and stopped.  By this time we could see that there was a large black object over the top of the RV that was blocking the stars.  We were all saying, 'What is that?' to each other. As soon as we stopped, our friend opened the door and we all got out of the RV. We then looked up and got a better idea what was above us.  It was a large, gun metal black triangular craft. It was moving very slowly, almost hovering over us.  It was huge - we estimated about the size of a football field.  We could only make out how big it was by the far corners as they had small blinking lights.  The lights are what made my husband think the craft was man made rather then extra-terrestrial. Also there was absolutely no noise coming from the craft.  No engine noise at all. Our friend went around to the back of our RV and climbed the ladder to stand on top of the RV to get a closer look.  It was really low - perhaps only 30 feet up.  It was over us for a few minutes then it kept drifting slowly east and gradually got faster.  Then, it got instant speed (like something you'd see on Star Trek's warp drive) and instantly flew out and over the horizon. In the distance were some hills (where the military base was marked on the map).  Once the craft disappeared we could see flashes of light coming from behind the hills kind of like lightning or weapon explosions.  These continued for a while. As we were discussing what we'd seen, three other objects started flying around.  Marked by three red lights, the three objects flew in formation together.  They moved in angular motion - angles, up and down, round, back and forward and zig zag.  They didn't fly like any normal craft you would recognise.  Again, they didn't seem to make any sound but they were further away than the first ship had been.  Really all we could see of them were three bright red lights - each light a separate object.  We watched them for about half an hour amazed at what we were seeing.  Eventually they seemed to leave the area.  As time was moving on we got back into the RV and took off slowly down the road still watching the sky. A short while later the three craft / red lights reappeared.  We stopped again, got out and watched them.  They did the same kind of manouvers as the first time. All in all, they disappeared and came back again about 4 times in total.  This all took place over the space of about 2.5 hours and over a distance of less than ten miles (that we travelled).  Then, the last time we saw the three lights/synchronized craft) they seemed to drop regular red coloured flares which went to the ground.  They then left the area.  A few minutes later two regular military jet aircraft flew over the area and into the distance over the hills.  Then nothing further happened. Amazed we eventually got going again and drove the rest of the way to Vegas, getting in around 11pm.  We sat up most of the night discussing and dissecting everything we'd seen just to make sure none of us were crazy!  We ended up assuming they were some kind of craft owned by the military but they were certainly nothing like anything we'd ever seen.  My husband worked in the Australian defense department in Canberra for years and had seen classified aircraft over the years but nothing like this.  Our friend who was with us is a computer/electric vehicle expert but still had never seen anything like these craft or the way they operated. I was surprised that nobody else stopped on the highway or seemed to see them.  I guess most people are busy and in their little world unlike us who were moving slow and observant whilst on our holiday.  So I hope you find this report of interest.  I've tried to explain it all as logically as I could.   P.S.--We had no video camera with us.  Our friend tried to take photos of the black craft but being black on a black sky in the dark, none came out so we have no photographic evidence.  Even though this happened a few years ago now, it's very fresh in all our minds.   It was an incredible experience.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Triangular-shaped object with white lights and one red light above the tree line at Red Rock Canyon,Las Vegas;2012-08-17 08:15:00;1-2 minutes;Triangular-shaped object with white lights and one red light above the tree line at Red Rock Canyon,Las Vegas On August 17, 2012 I was attending an outdoor play at Spring Mountain Ranch in Red Rock Canyon, Las Vegas, Nevada.  The play began at 8:00 p.m. under a somewhat cloudy sky threatening rain later on. At about 8:15p.m.-8:30p.m., an object between two trees to my right appeared in the sky above tree level. The object was about the size of my hand with my arm extended toward it, an equilateral triangle in shape, dome-shaped white lights formed a row around the inside dark perimeter of the triangle with a red dome light in the center. Against the grey cloudy sky the object was solid and a darker black-grey reminding me of the skin of the Stealth Plane. The object moved from the N/NW going in a S/SE direction. I lost sight of it behind two trees, but it re-appeared again about 60 seconds later. It seemed to be traveling rather slowly and flat so the visible area was the triangle with the lights below which stayed on continuously. There was no sound. It moved beyond my vision and though I watched the sky the remainder of the play until @ 9:15 p.m., I didn’t observe any other unusual occurrence. I was amazed at the lack of response by the people around me who clearly saw the object then just continued to watch the play.  A woman next to me said she saw the object and thought it was “just a UFO.”;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Small V shape, black object seen as dusk in Northwest Las Vegas, Nevada.;2012-12-02 16:30:00;35 seconds;Small V shape, black object seen as dusk in Northwest Las Vegas, Nevada. Sky was slightly overcast. I was watching TV, which sits just to the right of a South facing window.  Something caught my eye and I noticed from the above mentioned window, a blackish V (almost like a small Stealth fighter) shaped craft, moving from right to the left (West to East).   At first, I thought it was a kite, but it was moving very fast.  When it moved out of sight, due to the windows edge...   I quickly shifted my gaze towards a East face window and caught it moving away at a very brisk speed.  I heard no noise what-so-ever, nor did I notice any lights. Although my wife was with me, she did not see or here anything. Just a note for whom it my concern.  My house is only a few miles west of Nellis Air Force Base, which (in my opinion) was the direction the craft was heading towards.  Creech Air Force Base is also within 20 miles of my house and the is the home of unmanned aircraft. I suppose it could have been a military craft, but I consider myself very familiar with today's modern aircraft (both manned and unmanned) and I've never seen anything like this before.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

It was unclear what the lifting device was, because it was too dark.  It was light enough and close enough to determine that it was a remote control vehicle of unidentified type, perhaps quad copter, though could not be confirmed.  It landed nearby and was not that large, although large for a remote control vehicle.  It hovered over the event for quite some time, probably filming, although can't confirm.

Driving on 95S, saw a triangle with an inverted bottom, outlined in chasing white lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Former law enforcement.  PD));2016-01-05 21:35:00;i don't know;While driving on 95S, i saw a triangle with an inverted bottom, outlined in chasing white lights hovering/bobbing above Santa Fe casino I live in the Centennial Hills area of Las Vegas, NV.  This is the northwest. I was traveling to work southbound on the 95 freeway.  I was late for work.  I always watch the skies.  I don’t know why, it's not like I ever see anything.  On 1/5/2016 between the hours of 9:25pm and 9:45pm, I actually did.  As I passed the Santa Fe Casino, on my left, right above the casino I witnessed a triangular V-shaped object over the casino.  I cannot remember if it was over the parking garage area or closer to the casino part.  I am not sure.  What I am sure of, however, is that I was seeing a V-shaped aerial object.     The object that I saw was hovering in the air, as low as a helicopter could fly.  (I have had airplanes fly by or helicopters sit idle near me and I hear a sound)  This object was  emitting absolutely NO sound. It was close enough for me to hear a sound.  I would have heard a sound.  Were this a helicopter or an airplane, I'm sure I would have heard sound.  I thought maybe it was some type of military stealth flying object.  But why would it be just hovering Non-stealthily over the nasty old Santa Fe Casino?  Also I saw lights.  I cannot say for sure what other colors I saw besides white.  White was the dominant color, I do know that for sure.  There could have been other colors as well.  What I can say for absolute assurity is that the lights were chasing.  Chasing like those Christmas lights that people have.  The lights were chasing in the shape of the object that I was seeing, which was a V shape (acute triangle) two long sides with a shorter bottom.  The bottom was invert! ed to another v.      As I was seeing this, my psyche attempted to explain away my optical.  The reason I was unsuccessful at explaining this away, was because of the motion of the object.  As it hovered in that spot, it rotated at a half circle as it bobbed up and down slightly, while slightly tilted to the right.  The movement of the craft, the location of the craft and the fact that I could hear no sound from a craft that was in such close proximity to my vehicle are the reasons why I am writing this report.  The behavior of the craft frightened me more than the sight of it.  I felt an immediate fear mixed with excitement mixed with dread mixed with sadness.  A combination of feelings that I have never felt.     Please be advised that I was driving when I witnessed this.  I pulled to the carpool lane and started to drive very slowly to ensure that I was seeing what I was seeing.  I started to swerve cause I was looking at the object instead of looking at the road.  I turned away to keep from getting pulled over for a traffic violation.  I was afraid to stop and pull over. This happened to me.  I do not have any history of mental illness.  I have never made a report of something like this before.  I believe in the existence of something other than human beings for several reasons that I will not go into, because that is not what this report is for.   I just want whoever this gets to, to  take my accounts seriously.  I am a previous member of law enforcement.  I have had to listen to reports like this frequently from crazy people.  I know the difference.  I hope you do too.  I know what I saw.  I just would like someone to tell me why I saw it.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

When I noticed some electrical interference at my house with the lights flickering.  I had a feeling that I was being observed and happen to look around.  While looking around I glanced up into the sky and saw a black triangle in shape with 4 lights hovering above my house.  No sounds were aminating (sic.  emanating) from the craft.  The distance about (sic.  above??) my house was approximate a football field in length.   I watched the craft for between ten to fifteen minutes it hovered.  I grabbed my phone and from the inside and my dog noticed the object hovering and he started barking at it.  Once I grabbed my phone I took a photo of the object and continued to watch it as it vanished into thin air. I have experience in law enforcement and I have military experience as well.  This object clearly wasn't of this earth and I don't not want to have the photo released due to being ruined if I'm questioned or have my career jeopardized. I did enhance the photo that was taken and it was clear as day that it was a triangle with 4 different lights on the object.  No blinking lights that are common on current regulated aircraft.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

My seat was towards the rear of the jet, so I saw it after it showed up behind the wing, for under 10 seconds.   I grabbed my phone from the seat beside me, snapped a pic before it was out of view.  I thought, too small to be a jet, a smaller plane wouldn't be up this high, the shape was triangular.   I looked around and I was the only passenger with my shade up looking out.

New type of aircraft sighted over Las Vegas, NV.;2018-07-21 19:56:00;2 minutes;New type of aircraft sighted over vegas. At 7:56PM on July 21, 2018, I was having a cigarette outside of St. Rose Dominican hospital in the southwest part of Las Vegas, NV, when I saw what I belive is some new aircraft being tested near town.  I was looking to the southwest the right way at the right time to see a plane I think.  I do know however it was the fastest thing I've ever seen move through the air.  It was the same color as the night sky yet had a greyness to it due to the city lights bouncing off the bottem or belly.  I've flown my whole life, so I tried looking for all the usual suspects, vertical stabilizer(s)?  No.  Has some kind of fighter front end.  Intakes exhausts?  No.  Maybe a hint of a delta shape with a flat stealthy single point kinda like an F-117.  No sound none!  I was watching airliners depart the valley at the class B boundry.  A new plane type looked to me like it  was transitioning from class c (or uncotrolled airspace) to class bravo and close to commercial traffic.  He made whatever airliner that was look like he was standing still.  He was also higer in altitude than the traffic off his left... may I say wing?  I watched him fly over the horizon.  Not a sound at a speed I never seen before.  He flew right over my head I caught him when my head was about 80 degrees to already be watching airplanes so I saw him really good and for a time.  No lights of anykind this aircraft I dont think anyone would know it, if it was flying treetop level over there head's right now that quiet and that dark.  I'm proud I got to see such a thing.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

It;2019-02-20 13:47:00;12 mins;I was jogging in the afternoon when I saw a bright red flash in the sky. When I looked up, I was confused at what I was looking at. It took about 15 seconds or so for my brain to comprehend what I was looking at was a giant, beige colored, Triangular aircraft.  It was surrounded by 3 balls of light. 2 behind it,  1 out in front.  The balls of light appeared to be metal but it was too bright to see the shape of them.  The triangle sat not far above the tree tops, totally silent. It had 3 massive lights on the bottom.  2 red and 1 white light. They were rotating in sequence. First the red one would come on and get super bright, then dim out. Then the next red light did the same thing, followed by the white one. It kept repeating that sequence.  The light was so memorizing.  ((Sic.  Mesmerizing))  It wasn't light from light bulbs. It was bright like stars. The lights looked like they were coming from inside the aircraft. I was very close and wanted to go look directly under the aircraft. The top of the triangle appeared to be shifting.  It didn't appear to be solid. It looked like it was engulfed by boiling clouds, similar to what boiling water looks like, but instead of water, a cloud was boiling.  As I got closer to the triangle, I suddenly noticed all sound was gone. No traffic, nothing. I also felt like I was 3 feet in the air, even though I was on the ground. I felt as though I was on a pitcher's mound. Best way to describe it. The colors around me were slightly brighter or more vibrant. I felt like I was somewhere else although I appeared to be right where I was standing  Then a man on a bicycle came from behind me and I remember looking at him and he was moving in slow motion. It was so strange. It also was apparent he didn't see me or the massive aircraft in the sky.  I went to yell at him to look up and it felt like he was literally a million miles away.  It literally took him minutes to ride about 50 yds. He was in extreme slow motion.  As I stared at the 4 UAPs, another beige triangle appeared out of the thin air, flashed all 3 of it's lights, and vanished before my eyes. It didn't fly in and fly out, it literally appeared and vanished. It appeared a second time, flashed it's lights at either me or the other triangle, and it just vanished in the blink of an eye. Again, it did not fly away.  After it vanished the second time, I looked at the triangle, and it started going straight up. The 3 balls of light were gone and I could hear traffic again. Colors were back to normal. I felt like I was somewhere else prior.  Very hard to describe  It took the triangle 12 minutes to finally get out of my view. It rose straight up until I could no longer see it.  I could see the rotating lights for almost the entire time.  I realize my story is crazy, you don't need to tell me. I stopped telling people because of how it sounds coming out of my mouth.  I can assure you, it's 100% true. I mean, I came up on a massive Triangle aircraft,  up close, in the middle of a sunny afternoon and I saw aircraft vanish into thin air. You start to question your reality and sanity.  Thank you for your time;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

I watched a triangular ufo reveal its self for a few moments.;2021-02-06 05:00:00;3 minutes;I watched a triangular ufo reveal its self for a few moments. Hey there I would like to share my experience I had this morning @ 5am pacific time. Feb 6, 2021. Location: Henderson , NV ( Las Vegas ) So every morning I go out side to walk my fiancé out to the car for work. When he leaves I get to go off to the side of the house and enjoy a smoke. I noticed this morning that the Big Dipper constellation ( from where I was standing )  It had extra stars ** near it I remember thinking. I goto light my cigarette and I look up... & I see a giant triangle formation floating in a circular motion next to the big dippers  spoon. It spun twice , by the time I realized what it was. It had stopped moving & turned a little darker than the night sky. But was still camouflaged. I ran inside.  It scared me because of how large it was. Every morning I see UFOs dark across our skies , but today this was closer than the stars or satellites I end up seeing. Was a little weird.  Thank you for taking the time to read this!;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
