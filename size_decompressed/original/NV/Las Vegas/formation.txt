Formation of  balls of light travelling across the sky, one behind the other, early in 1997.;1997-02-14 18:00:00;5 minutes +/-;Formation of  balls of light travelling across the sky, one behind the other, early in 1997. I went out to feed the horse at about 6 or 7 pm - Feb.? 14? 1997 - and looked up to the sky. It was a cripsy clear calm night with cotton ball clouds. I could see the stars behind the clouds. The lights of the city were slightly illuminating the clouds. Suddenly I saw one ball of light pass above the clouds moving in a South-Westerly maybe more Southerly direction. It looked odd so I kept watching. Then another ball of light exactly the same size and distance moved the same direction following the first, completely silent. I kept watching and there was another and another. I ran in to get my video camera and started taping this. There were several more. They seemed to be spaced the same distance apart and travelling the same rate of speed, like in some kind of formation, though the patches of clouds made it difficult to be exact. My first thought was that they were satellites, but then do satellites travel in this manner? I've seen many satellites before, but these were closer, or a lot larger-if they were out in space! These balls of light were about the size of a small green pea if you held it in-between your forefinger and thumb in an out-stretched arm. I think I counted about seven to ten seconds between each ball of light. Also, they just seemed too perfect for shooting stars - and there were too many of them. I saved the tape it's on (I hope!) Though I only got the last few of the formation on tape. I have other family 8mm tapes I've been meaning to go through to put on disc. Hopefully, I'll find this footage. When I do, I'll send you a copy. I've seen other unexplained things in the Nevada sky, and yes I've seen F-117 and the B-2 bomber, both stealths, amoung other military jets. Nothing I've seen looks like any of these. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
My wife and I watched 3 craft fly accross the airport grounds headed towards our hotel and become stationary above us.;1997-09-09 16:00:00;5 minutes;My wife and I watched 3 craft fly accross the airport grounds headed towards our hotel and become stationary above us. The craft were flying in echelon formation out of the east accross the airport grounds. 1 Large 2 small, the large craft was in the front. When the large one slowed down. The other two literally vansished. the large one came to a complete stop and hovered over our location slowly ascending. I managed to get a picture of it at one point. You could see the object was plainly metallic with and appeared to be layered with distinct lines. The sun was glinting off of it. It moved through the small puff clouds that were passing over and was till visible as they passed underneath.  As one cloud large cloud moved in and passed under it, I lost sight of it and when cloud moved on the craft was no longer there. I witneesed this object from the 15 floor window of the luxor hotel accross from the airport. Our room faced the front of the hotel. I sent my negative to a lab hear locally who did a stereo graph analysis of the pic to get an ide of it's size and height above the ground. the height was approximated at 1000 feet agl. The object was estimated at least 60 feet in diameter. I remember this day well. It changed my life and my beliefs.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

I was hopeing that somebody else beside myself and my fiance' and a neighbor had seen this event.  It was around 9:00 pm on a Saturday.  Our apartment is located a couple of blocks east of the main Las Vegas Strip behind the Sands Convention center. Me and my fiance' were standing out on the balcony looking to the west over the casino area and notice around 9 to 10 bright spherical objects flying in a 'V'formation moving relatively slow in a northernly direction. About this time my neighbor of whom works at Macharran Airport was walking up the stairs to his apartment.  I pointed the objects out to him and mentioned to him that those weren't air planes and he should know considering that he works at the air port, we watched them for about 3 minutes and they just faded out while moving in a northernly direction.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

12 burnt-orange lights -- each zipping from DIFFERENT directions --  maneuvered around an oval  black shape.;2001-03-22 00:40:00;3 minutes;12 burnt-orange lights -- each zipping from DIFFERENT directions --  maneuvered around an oval  black shape. Three of us outside Starbucks coffee shop parking lot at Paradise and Flamingo avenues in Las Vegas very early Thursday morning (12:40 a.m.), 3/22/01, saw an amazing display of a squadron of burnt-amber lights -- each coming from different directions -- zipping about a black oval shape in a highly coordinated, interacting, maneuvering display. To the south, the Luxor Hotel's laser beamed straight up, and we could see nighthawks illuminated in the lower part of the beam, but those were not the UFOs we are describing in this report.  There were no clouds. We were looking up at a 45-degree angle and to the northwest.  At arm's length, the entire system appeared to cover no more than an inch. Witness #1 first saw the lights moving like a wave like a sine wave, then changing to individual burnt-amber dots in a straight, non-waving line like a string of beads, then changing to a circular formation.  Then each light spread away from the others, weaving in and out from each other in highly coordinated maneuvering, each moving at the same speed but from different directions.  In this last configuration, the 12 lights were all zipping around a contained oval diameter, but the startling aspect to the movements was the highly coordinated maneuvering between the objects.  The entire system slowly moved north and perhaps upward until it was too far away to see. Witness #2 (this writer) saw the formation only at this latter stage, when the 12 burnt-amber lights were simultaneously zipping around the ovoid shape but each one coming from a different direction and going to a different location about this black ovoid shape.  All 12 lights stopped momentarily before again zipping around in different directions and not in sequence, but all around this black shape. This was done repeatedly for about two minutes.  The movements were fast, including very fast but rounded turns -- no zig-zagging. Mike Castrada, chief of the Public Affairs Office at Nellis Air Force Base, told me he has no report of this, which he would not have if it were classified, but he wishes he were there and that if Project Blue Book were still open, this report would probably be a case they would put into it. Castrada said that it appears we were looking at the Western part of the Nellis Test Range. Castrada said that various FAA and Air Force radars control all that air space -- about 12,000 square miles -- from 3000 ft. about the North Las Vegas Airport to infinity, and all the way to the Utah border. Castrada said that Special Forces was there on an exercise but only from 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.  He said that if they were flying at night, they wouldn't have their lights on because that would defeat the purpose.  He said Special Forces might have had perhaps four but not 10 to 12 planes. Witness #3 viewed the object thhe same length of time as Witness #1 but has not yet been interviewed in detail.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Flying formation of several oval/cone shaped objects over Bellagio Hotel.;2001-03-27 23:58:00;1 minute;Flying formation of several oval/cone shaped objects over Bellagio Hotel. While waitng to observe the water show at the Bellagio hotel on 3/27/01, my wife and I observed several oval/cone shaped craft (18-19) directly overhead flying towards the Flaming Hotel (just prior to midnight). They were in formation, and totally silent, but changed positions and were casting their own individual light (self illuminated). They were not in any spotlight or hotel light beam. I was able to record the event with my VHS camcorder and have a copy of the film with the objects. They disappeared when they passed over the adjacent hotel. I have provided a report and a copy of my film over 1 year ago to the Las Vegas local MUFON chapter. A Ms. Nancy Smoot (MUFON) has contacted me but is baffled by the objects on the film. I wonder if you could help us understand what the objects on the film could be. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  We have written the witness, requesting still frames from the video.

The four red lights that buzzed Nellis A.F.B. && The one Orange one that played cat;2001-03-29 20:30:00;30 MIN.;The four red lights that buzzed Nellis A.F.B. && The one Orange one that played cat At about 8:30pm Thursday @ Lamb Blvd. & Carey Ave. in Las Vegas, NV. I had gone to the phone @ a convienence store and while on the phone to a friend, I was looking to the N.W. when I noticed four red light's in the sky, they were pulsing and moving toward's me and stopped above Nellis Air Stip, then the one on the right left the staggered line formation and dipped down below the others,( the centers were white but the pulses were red flashes ), and strobed brighter than the other's as it manuvered around below the others from right to left, then it hovered for a few second's flashing brighter in intensity then proceded on its course to my left and circled around back up to the others and they all proceded to move away to the N.W.N then northerly and out of sight. These red lights were not like a planes red light because they were at least 10 times brighter and the one that was manuvering around was at least 20 times brighter because I could compare them to planes in the sky above L.V., and I didn't notice any sound coming from the direction of the objects, then all of a sudden Nellis A.F.B. came alive with sound, jet engines roar filled the air and it was constant, then planes started taking off one after the other, I counted between 10 and 12 in the first wave and they climbed upward fast to about 12,000 to 15,000 feet and leveled off and they proceded toward the direction the UFO's had gone. The first wave made a scurmish line roughly five miles long from left to right above the mountain range of the Nellis test site range and they seemed to me to be hearding or escorting the objects out of the area and it seemed also that they were looking for them and blocking them from the test site area. While the first wave was busy several more waves of planes took off in groupes of 4 and 6 and this lasted for a good 10 minutes and I stsrted to loose count but I estimated between 30 and 40 planes had taken off in that time and the last wave of planes to take off were the big airliner size and I counted 5 of th! em and a t this time I noticed another large plane coming in to nellis from the east at about 15,000 feet and it eventually headed off to the N.W. also but was just above the flight path of the fighters that were taking off. I continued to watch the planes that were still flying around above the test range to the north of me and all of a sudden out of thin air amist planes there appeared a white orange light object and the planes in the immediate area changed there courses toward the object and then it flashed a bright orange and winked out and re-appeared in a new place in the sky in the same area and all the planes changed there courses again and the object winked out again and re-appeared in another spot like it was playing its version of cat and mouse and it did this atleast four times that I saw 'cause I grabbed my binocularsto see if I could Identify these Objects for myself then it winked out brightly one last time and was gone and the planes cicled around for a few more seconds and then headed north. This second sighting occured @ about 8:45pm p.s.t. I watched for another 15 minutes then went to the phone to report the sighting I had just witnessedfirst hand. After talking to Mr. Davenport I was a little taken aback by his disbelief as to the number of planes I witnessed taking off from N.A.F.B., it was as though he thought the number of planes was excessive, but he wasn't here and I was, so after I hung up with Mr. Davenport I went staight home,for I was about 45 seconds from home and started to write down what I saw as per Mr. davenport's instruction's and then I heard the plkanes coming back in to land, so I stopped writing and went outside and started counting the number of planes that were coming into land and I counted 38 fighter's and 6 big airliner size type military planes and with my binoculars I was able to distinguish 9 different types of planes of the fighter's and big planes and they kept coming in until 10:35pm (pst) and the big planes landed last and one was a propeller type and they! finishe d landing by 11pm and I finished this report at 11:42pm (pst). ((NUFORC Note:  Source of this report is anonymous, but apparently is the same person who telephoned our hotline about this alleged event.  We have no other reports of 30-40 planes taking off from Nellis.  Upon reflection, we suspect that few military air bases have 30-40 military aircraft, and the necessary crew members and necessary ground personnel, to get that many aircraft in the air on short notice, and in a very short period of time.  Moreover, the air traffic control problem, it seems to us, would be significant.  If anyone can provide more information about this alleged incident, we would be grateful for additional reports.

I was outside in my backyard looking at the night sky and spotted a V-formation of dim orangish lights approaching from the SE headed NW. As they got closer I saw there were 8 separte objects, eliptical in shape and all about an 1/8 inch in diameter if you held a ruler at arms length. The intensity of the lights never changed but they didn't glow like normal lights. They were dull and there was no glare. They were edging each other out much like race cars down the final stretch but still maintained more or less a close V-shape and appeared to glide rather than fly as they passed overhead at about my 1 o'clock position. I estimated their altitude to be about 20,000 ft. Their speed was incredible, covering about 90 degress of sky in about 5 seconds and were completely silent.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

There it was joined by two similar objects, one coming from the South and another from the East. They formed a perfect equilateral triangle and the whole group then drifted to the East.  After a few minutes the original one took off North at unbelievable speed , the other two took off South also at very fast speed.

Green lights across las vegas, fast, tightly formationed and switching places, low flying and gone within 30 seconds.;2009-04-07 22:30:00;20 to 30 seconds;Green lights across las vegas, fast, tightly formationed and switching places, low flying and gone within 30 seconds. On holiday in Las vegas, on the night of 4/7/09, myself and two others were on the rooftop of our hotel having a drink, i had only been sitting facing toward the south side of the strip watching aircraft for five minutes when i seen it. I couldn't believe my eyes when these green lights travelling atleast twice or three times the speed of any aircraft in the area came into vision. They must have passed directly over the airport and were changing formations in ways no kind of fighter jets or anything could. Green lights, roughly 8 of them, circular, tightly packed and switching places but keeping in a tight formation, this was so distinct and clear, i wouldn't be surprised if aircraft or other people spotted this that night as the sky was clear and alot of planes and helicopters were around. Also as they were so low, probably on 2000ft, someone else must have seen what we did. I quickly said to the two people beside me to look and they too seen the lights, they moved so fast across the sky that they were gone over the hills to the west of vegas within 30 seconds, no noise came from this, which for the speed they were moving you would expect to hear something from it. Also seen a helicopter head of in that direction five mintues later, which seemed odd as no helicopters the whole week i was there seemed to head off in that direction. Watching the sky for strange things is not something i would often do, this was so real and i would have loved to have captured this on camera, it was truly unbelievable and i don't expect anyone to believe me but i know what i seen and it was to my eyes not of this world so to speak.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

We all watched the irregular formation of about thirty white objects and noticed that it was completely still and not moving like birds would do.   We watched it for about a minute and said if it was balloons they’d probably be moving around in the wind.    The formation remained still but then we noticed 3 red objects come from within and they were definitely moving in formation away from the white objects.
