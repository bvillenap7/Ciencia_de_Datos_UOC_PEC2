Burning object spotted over the Las Vegas strip;2000-08-03 22:30:00;15-30seconds;Burning object spotted over the Las Vegas strip I initially commented on this object being the moon, but partially covered by some sort of cloud or something, until we saw the object getting brighter.  At that point, my first instinct was that it was an airplane blowing up in the sky.  I work for an airline and thought it had to be a plane of some sort blowing up in the sky.  The object appeared to burn for a short period of time (5-15 seconds) and then it appeared to completely burn out, leaving 2 trails of smoke behind.  We saw nothing after this.  I have heard nothing of the sighting on the local or national news, radio, newspaper or in conversation.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
bright blue fire ball falling down in the North Las Vegas area by Nells AFB.;2001-09-21 23:00:00;2 and half seconds;bright blue fire ball falling down in the North Las Vegas area by Nells AFB. I was driving in my car, turning down and traveling east on Katie St. just off Maryland Prkwy. by Boulevard Mall. Just above the mall looking north, I couldn't help not to have seen, what took my attention by the extreme brightness of intensity. My estimation is that this would have been located more directly above the Nellis Airforce Base by my judging it. Looked very simular to a satellite burning upon hitting the atmosphere but like i said, brightly burning with a blue color and tail. Happened very fast and there was no sound or smoke. Never heard any reports or news as well. My reason to report this is the variation of how this burning object was unlike other types of instances I have seen from meteors, burning satellites, and comets encountered. Possible that the close proximity was a factor but where did it hit? Never heard news of it since? while I am here I would like to mention that Las Vegas, NV is the brightest city seen on the planet earth and looks as though where a star on the planets surface. If our telescopes where to see a star on the the surface of Mars, it would be a phenomena of amazing proportion. IS LAS VEGAS SOME TYPE OF BEACON TO THE SKY??? TRY TO FIND PHOTOGRAPHS.  thanks;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Red Glow Streaks Across Southwest -- Crashes to Earth;2002-09-03 21:10:00;5 minutes;Red Glow Streaks Across Southwest -- Crashes to Earth I was working last Tuesday night in Las Vegas. While I was standing outside I saw a strange red glowing object moving southwest to northeast. The object appeared to be spherical but was slightly irregular and it's intensity varied. It looked like it was spinning or burning but maintained it's trajectory. After watching it for about 5 minutes it suddenly stopped and fell directly to earth. I watched it fall until it disappeared over  the horizon above the surrounding buildings.  As it fell it got even brighter, like a large fireball 500-3000 miles away? I have flown small aircraft and know airplanes. I have also spent many nights camping in Nevada's desert and know the difference between airplanes, satellites and meteors. When I saw this I was standing in a brightly lit parking lot in the middle of Las Vegas, certainly someone in Northern Nevada must have seen this? I have not seen anything on the news or in the paper? I'm not sure exactly what it was but it was very unusual. Any  information concerning this or news of a related sighting would be greatly appreciated.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
A comet shaped object, with a bright tail vanishing to a spot;2002-12-29 14:00:00;5 min approx.;A comet shaped object, with a bright tail vanishing to a spot We were coming back from Las Vegas to San Diego and we saw this thing, comet shaped, injecting a fire kind of light at the tail.  It was there in the sky for approximately 5 minutes, and moving but it left no trail. The injection of the fire kind of thing vanished gradually in +/- 30 sec to a black dot. And the sky was clear as if it was never there.  Surprisingly the light or the fire was so bright that it was noticable even at 2:00 in the afternoon. We managed to get a couple of pictures of this thing. ((FOLLOW-UP FROM WITNESS)) Hallo Mr. Davenport, Thanks for your reply. But I am almost sure that it is not a jet trail and hence some more clarification would be appreciated. The reason is that I have been in India near a Military base and have seen lots of jet trails and that's why I am so sure of the fact that it cannot be a jet trail. I have seen the jet trails from lots of aircrafts and am a regular watcher of Wings. So I would really appreciate some more explanation if you could provide so. Also as I mentioned it vanished from the air in less than a minute which is quite unlikely for a jet trail since they persist for a longer duration because of the density differences of the water which is ejected out and the atmosphere. Thanks and regards  ((name deleted)) ((END));36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Las Vegas  Fireball seen at Spanish Trails after the storm passed on Saturday Aug 16, 2003;2003-08-16 23:00:00;4 seconds;Las Vegas  Fireball seen at Spanish Trails after the storm passed on Saturday Aug 16, 2003 LAS VEGAS, NV - SATURDAY AUGUST 16, 2003 11:00 PM after the storm.  SATURDAY NIGHT - A friend and I were swimming at Spanish Trails when a decent (awesome) storm passed thru with heavy rain, thunder and lightning....enough for storm lovers to get out of the pool. :) We waited and watched in the patio for it to pass so when it did move south, we got back in the pool. Within minutes to half an hour, I was sitting with someone and talking on a pool ledge. We both had seen a couple shooting stars earlier, very faint, far and normal, however..... facing north from Tropicana, and VERY close, we saw a bright white ball of streak heading straight down lasting for 2 seconds and then it turned green for another 2 seconds and it went out of view behind the house, but right after it cleared the rooftop, we saw a light of explosion (circular afterglow) just beneath the horizon of the rooftop, obstructing our view of the explosion. It seemed SO very closeby, it had to be within city limits or on the south side of town. It was big because the streak was wide. The thing disappearing from our view (back of the house) but still falling gives you a sense of how close this fireball came to the ground. I asked people the next day (on Sun) if they saw it too but no avail, and I missed the news......  IF YOU HAVE SEEN THIS EVENT PLEASE CONTACT ME. I cant find it anywhere in the news or paper. Thanks very much.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Three Fireballs in the Las Vegas sky flying in formation then becoming one fireball. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights?  PD));2006-10-01 19:45:00;10 minutes;Three Fireballs in the Las Vegas sky flying in formation then becoming one fireball. Just before sunset on this particular evening I was sitting on the balcony of the Knights Inn airport hotel in Las Vegas located at 5100 Paradise Rd. (The day of the this report is approximate as it has been many years ago)   As I looked  into the West, I noticed at roughly 40 degrees above the horizon  what appeared to be three fireballs in the sky.  They appeared pretty far away.  I would guess from where I was they must have been between 5 to 10 miles away.    I studied them carefully and determined that they were not any type of man made aircraft I am aware of.  I work for the airlines and I am familiar with aircraft of many kinds in various types of weather and lighting conditions and have never seen anything like this before.  They literally looked like balls of fire floating in the sky.   During this sighting the fireballs would fly in formation left and right at low speed, then separate and fly apart from one another then all come together and form one ball of fire.  They did this many times until eventually the single fireball ascended into the sky and became invisible to the naked eye. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights?

12 Flickering Orange Lights Over Las Vegas, NV;2010-04-20 21:00:00;10 Minutes;12 Flickering Orange Lights Over Las Vegas, NV Noticed a bright orange light flying relatively low over Las Vegas through my living room window. Walked outside my home and looked north to see approximately nine more bright, flickering orange lights moving eastward and apparently ascending at a very fast rate. At first, I thought it may have been a helicopter but it was too fast and the bright orange, flickering light is unlike anything I have ever seen flying in the sky. The lights appeared to ascend at a fast rate and I believe the flickering lights “went out” as a result of moving away from me. I have never experienced a ‘UFO’ before but it’s a strange feeling–this was something technologically advanced. Perhaps from Area 51 just north of our city?;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

We noticed lights off into the distance from our upstairs bedroom window that we had never seen before.  So, we pulled out the telescope and were able to see the lights circling above ground.  We wondered if it could be helicopters circling over a fire when we noticed some of the lights turn bright red.  But the colors kept changing from white or yellowish to red, so it couldn't have been flames.   Plus we turned on the news and heard no reports of a ire out near red rock, where the lights seem to be near.  At one point 4 red lights appeared to break off from a brighter yellowish white light and scattered in different directions.  What the heck is this?  And why isn't it on the news?

Sam Boyd orange fiery ufo.;2013-06-30 00:00:00;15 minutes;Sam Boyd orange fiery ufo. I was working the night crew for Sam Boyd Stadium, and earlier, I heard of a fire ball in ths sky that.  came from the wetlands where all the citys water runs back into lake mead.  A coworker said I missed it, but he said it hovered the exploded into a fire ball.  He said he thought it was a flare but then when it cMs ovst the butler building he thought it was a missel or a millitary rocket.  But when it got closer it looked like a fite ball or orb.  Then exploded as it took off and left real fast.  I didnt see it yet.  But as we were gking on break walking to the shop.the butler building the maintenance shop.  The orb was not a missel or a rocket. It got really close and I stood in amazement.  And it was glowing like a fire all around. It kind of look like a jApanese lantern but nothing like those japanese kites or lanterns.  It looked like it had 4 jet streams spinning in.a circle and A 5 jet stream pointing down the ground.  It was really amazing.becausr the top of it! looked like an optapus head or it was oval.with a sharp point tip like a tent but what I could describe it it looked like an insect or felt like it was a living organism and I.could feel.it like.it could sence me and gave me the chills.  It wasnt like the metalic space crafts you hear or see on tv lr nothing like the normal ufo sightingz.  The firery orb seemed more like a living organism and glowed and fiery orange or amber type of glowing live flames or real .fire.  It was real quite and made no sound.  Then it flew around the stadium around the west where I stood almost as close to the light poles then flew around the south end.  Then we All went on break.  The sighting I.believe they live in the wetlands behind sam boyd stadium.  Because it came from the mountains behind the stadium. Sam boyd elevation is one of the lowest part of the vegas valley.  Plus I think.now that the wetlands preserve is undergoing construction with the hicking trail.  Alot of construction and bulldozers are channeling.the water and the water detention basin to get the wetlands to flow.  I.think they are messing up with the naturL process of nature of the desert of this aetland oasis. . Maybe this ufo lives in the waters or lake mead.
