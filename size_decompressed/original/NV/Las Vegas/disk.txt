9 Years Old , Brothers & I Saw Disk/Craft Very Close.;1982-07-15 21:00:00;uncertain;9 Years Old , Brothers & I Saw Disk/Craft Very Close. Around 9 years old , over grandmas house in w.las vegas (flamingo & tanaya area) in and around 1982. My brothers age 7 & 10 wittnessed it longer than I from the front driveway , seeing more of a side / bottom view. I dont remember the circumstances why I did not see it until ran to the side / back of house.  Stopping at a small tree , looking directly up through the leaves I saw 3 to 4 round white lights rotating in counter clockwise circle pattern very slowly w/ no sound. Judging from my brothers drawings , the lights went all the way around the disk shape. My view was partially blocked from some tree brances & the corner of the house.  This thing was close ! 25 feet from ground ! These are all single story homes nieghborhood. We were young but all remember this image. My father remembers me hurrying him out of the house to see it & that he did not see it. While watching peter jennings (seeing is believing) ? for some reason ? My image clicked / crystal clear in my mind. This is how I stumbled on to your web-site. Included w/ this report is a drawing from each of us who wittnessed this.

At 11:08 we saw an orange illuminated round object approaching from the South. It flew directly above us and headed North/east.About one minute later we saw another coming from the same area as the first, again flew above us and off to the north. About two minutes passed, then the third appeared, this time from the south/slightly west. About 15 seconds later the 4th appeared, then another 15 seconds elapsed and the 5th appeared. The 4th & 5th came from the same direction as the first. There was a full moon that evening and clear visibility. In comparision to planes which we could see flying off to the east, the speed of these craft was 4X the speed of the planes. No more than one object was visible at the same time. It took each object 5 seconds to cross our line of vision. All objects left in the same north/east direction. I have contacted the local newspaper and found that a man called to report orange objects int he sky that Saturday, however the newspaper did not take a report or get a name/number. A woman called a local television station and reported seeing one round object at 3:30am on Sunday the 26th, again a name/number was not obtained.I went on a well listened to local radio station and discussed my sighting and asked to have others who also saw this call, there were no calls. I have also reported this to NIDS.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
It's You, What happen? Somebody set up us the bomb. Take off every Zig.;2001-03-14 00:32:00;3 minutes;It's You, What happen? Somebody set up us the bomb. Take off every Zig. We were standing on the strip just south of the Stratosphere Tower on Las Vegas Blvd.  We looked up and saw a large, metallic object.  It had flashing lights which had a definite sequence to them. There were about 10 lights in all.  They alternated in their flashing sequence from right to left as best we could tell.  The UFO must have been 10000 feet or greater.  The visibility was clear.  It moved up and down and then side to side in an A type motion.  It changed altitudes quite rapidly and began moving in an Y pattern.  After a little hovering, it moved in a B pattern. Then back to A.  Then back to a B pattern.  It then moved like a T, before performing a U maneuver and then shooting off in the sky at a high rate of speed.  After the incident, my girlfriend turned to me and said, What you say?   My friends began acting strangely and their speech became quite strange.  My other friend said, You have no chance to save, make your time!!  At this point, the third party in my group said, Somebody  set up us the bomb.  I couldn't believe this happened.  I hope you can find some information from McCarran for me or maybe Nellis. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what B, A, T, and Y maneuvers are.

Looking north in Las Vegas I saw a grey disc  moving erratically which vanished on a straight  incline after less than a minute.;2005-04-18 13:00:00;A minute or less;Looking north in Las Vegas I saw a grey disc  moving erratically which vanished on a straight  incline after less than a minute. I'm a retired nurse who was sitting in my backyard looking at the clouds.   At first I couldn't understand how a bird could be flying so high. I saw a charcoal greyish colored roundish disc (saucer) to the north of me seeming to be going from west to east.  This had to be at 13:00 because when it was over I got my phone and the time was 13:03.   The object seemed slightly wider on the bottom.  The total time was about a minute or slightly less.  It began to drift side to side decending some as it did. Then it moved at a steady upward slight incline and vanished!  There were few thin clouds in that area.   I remained looking a minute or two but didn't see it again.  Within a few minutes three (of what I think are military) jets went through that area.  They flew two in the front and one behind, from east to west. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she seemed exceptionally objective and lucid to us we suspect that she is a very good witness.  The object was slightly to the west of due north, according to the witness, and she seemed certain that the jets she witnessed were military in nature.  PD));36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Disk shaped object with rotating lights seen from the Las Vegas strip.;2007-07-10 22:00:00;2 min;Disk shaped object with rotating lights seen from the Las Vegas strip. On July 10th.  At about 10:00pm my wife and I were staying at a hotel on the south end of the Las Vegas strip.  While lying on the bed taking in the view of the strip we seen on disk shaped object that looked like a spinning top  with rotating lights. It came from the area over the Luxor hotel and went north with a helicopter  that seem to be following it. We watched it until it went out of sight.  10 -15 mins later the object came back and traveled on the same flight path as the first time, only this time the helicopter wasn’t around. I know that Vegas has a lot of helicopters and planes but we believe that was not either one, it brought both of us out of the bed to the window for a closer look.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Disc over my apt complex with a military plane and helicopter (air force i assume);2007-10-30 18:27:00;2 to 3 minutes;Disc over my apt complex with a military plane and helicopter (air force i assume) I was on my way driving home exiting the freeway when i noticed a black military plane in the shape of a triangle coming directly from the direction of the air force base towards  my apartment complex. The plane had two black smoke trails, very thin and it was also had two to three lights, one on each wing and maybe one underneath the head of the plane. As i got closer to my apt. complex, I noticed one of those long helicopters with the one propellers on each end of it which must have already been in the vicinity that seemed to be interacting with what I perceived to be a ufo. As soon as i notice the helicopter and the ufo right near each other the military plane that i saw coming towards the area when i was exiting the freeway was  clearly flying over my apt. complex then made a very sharp curve behind the disc which was not moving at all, suspended in mid-air as was the helicopter about one hundred feet to the left of the ufo which was only about 200 to 300 feet above the ground directly over the complex. It was in plan view, nothing was obstructing my view at all at this point. I really dont know if anyone else paying attention  but there were people in the area outside in the location. I was so excitied that i did not stop to stare at it because i was trying to hurry and get in the house to get my wife and bring her out to witness what i had seen. But unfortunatley to say by the time we came back out it was gone.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Three glowing discs above Las Vegas New years.;2008-01-01 00:02:00;2 minutes;Three glowing discs above Las Vegas New years. I was looking to the north east as the vegas strip firworks were starting. I am in the south west area of las vegas. I looked to the south and saw two orange glowing discs. I was very perplexed. The discs sometimes appeared to be two discs then they changed into one disc each. Then a third came into view. They were heading southwest towards the L.A. area. I watched these glowing discs and knew they were not firworks, airplanes or helicopters. I continued to watch as they faded from view. All this was going on while the fireworks were going on the strip. The discs had what appeared to be a glowing orange field around them each. They were not very bright but I could see general shape and outline. I know others had to see what I was seeing.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
Multi colored, lighted spinning craft with greyish brown cloud surrounding it and bright white light over Henderson, NV.  ((Star??));2008-10-08 01:30:00;4 hours;Multi colored, lighted spinning craft with greyish brown cloud surrounding it and bright white light over Henderson, NV. On 10-8-08 at approximately 0130 hours my girlfriend and I were walking our dogs at the park and I noticed what a clear night it was. I looked towards the South East over Henderson, NV and observed a bright white light which seemed to be moving slowly from side to side. The object was approximately twenty-thousand feet up in the air. I told my girlfriend to look up at the lights and we observed blue, green, red flashes as the object appeared to be spinning. We observed the object move very slowly in various directions almost as if it was floating around the sky over the Henderson urban-sprawl. The object had a brownish-grey cloud around it at all times and the light it emitted had illuminated the cloud around it, which seemed to follow it wherever it would go. We stayed at the park for approximately an hour, and marveled at what we saw and the changing lights. We decided to drive in the direction of it and ended up at a housing development near Silverado Ranch and Eastern. I believe it was called “South Fork” off Eastern Avenue. We parked in front of  various houses that were in the South East area of the housing development itself and it appeared to be very close to our vehicle compared to when we were at the park. It made no sound itself. We both stared at the lights which were still green, red, white, and blue at times, but it was mostly white and the colors would come and go. At one point a red laser type light emitted from the craft which seemed to be a smaller light than the others and a different color red that circled around the craft which was spinning. I told my girlfriend looking at the lights was becoming difficult because they were so bright it hurt and she agreed. I flashed my hazard lights, as we were in my vehicle, and when I did this on two occasions the lights became more active and the small red laser light would almost answer back to us and seemed to shine in our eyes directly! The dogs with us were whimpering and whining. The unidentified craft seemed to be getting c! loser to our vehicle. I was looking at the clock the entire time in the quiet neighborhood and I never lost any time during the sighting. At one point my girlfriend says it looks like a disco in the sky! She also described the white portion of the lights as “like a starburst“. I could make out the shape of the craft in only one instant and it appeared to be bell shaped, however the lights made the craft appear to be disc shaped and spinning. The cloud cover around the craft did not look like normal clouds almost as if the cloud was emitted from the craft. At the housing development we could hear helicopter sounds but we did not see any helicopters and I thought this was suspicious. This object was not a helicopter as it did not have small red flashing lights on the tail but large multicolored ones. During our sighting, we both agreed about what we observed and we shared the exact same reactions to the UFO at the same time. We drove up Easter, a little more South up towards the “Anthem” area, which actually is up the mountains of the Valley and parked. We could still observe the UFO from our vehicle however it appeared to be more East of us and also appeared to be rising in altitude slowly. We came to the agreement that we had actually driven around the UFO, which made me to believe the object was large however not very high in altitude. Other things about the sighting were we observed several shooting stars during this sighting in alternate areas of the sky than the UFO. At one point in the sighting we observed white beams shoot out from the craft. We also observed several smaller orb craft around the craft during the sighting. Because I did not know the exact distance of this craft it is difficult to say the size but I did get the impression it was possibly a mother ship as at about 0530 hours it was high in the sky and only white light when we got back to the house with the smaller craft possibly following it up. This craft seemed to be a pyramid shape at times as it gained altitude. This is my first UFO sig! hting an d we shared it together, as it was her first as well. We felt like we had a connection with it and hope others saw it that very early morning. We did not have a camera in the vehicle and we did not want to run back home to get one in fear we would lose track of the UFO.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Large, white, dome shaped object spotted near a  Janet plane in Las Vegas;2010-07-27 15:00:00;2-3 minutes;Large, white, dome shaped object spotted near a  Janet plane in Las Vegas I smoke cigarettes from my second floor balcony many times throughout the day.  My balcony faces Northeast towards Nellis Airforce Base in Las Vegas, NV, and has a clear view of the northeastern section of sky.  As I smoke, I frequently watch planes landing or taking off from Mcarren Airport, or I watch aircraft fly to and from Nellis.  On August 27th around 3 p.m. I was on my balcony, and I noticed right away that a plane was approaching Las Vegas from the North. Whats interesting about that is Ive learned through months of everyday observing that planes do not fly in from the North, so I picked up my binoculars (used for watching the planes and helicopters fly from Nellis) and saw that it was one of those Janet planes that transport employees to and from Area 51 (Classic red stripe passenger plane with no identifiable markings). As I followed the plane with my binoculars, I then noticed something appear in my field of vision that was further away beyond the! Janet plane. I stopped and adjusted my binocs to get a clearer image of what this object was, and once I did I could see a white, solid, dome shaped object hovering in place far off in the distance. I know distances can be deceiving, so I dont want to say how far away i think it was exactly, but I can say it was miles, beyond Sunrise mountain and perhaps even Lake Mead. I stood and watched it for 2-3 minutes until I noticed another Janet plan coming into approach at McCarran. I took my eyes off the craft for only a second and when I scanned the area it had been, it was gone! I searched the entire sky for about 20 minutes and never saw it again. It was dome shaped, white and never moved from the spot I first saw it. I assume that it was far away, and if it was then I would say the craft was huge. Being stationary, I was able to study it for 2-3 minutes through my binoculars and though it was too far to make out any details, I can say it was big enough to clearly make out it! s shape. I am absolutely certain that it was not a plane, heli! copter, weather balloon, or any other craft Ive ever seen in my life. It was a clear, hot summer day with no clouds in sight. I hope you find this information useful. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  PD));36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

Saw small stationary clouds forming from thin air,later saw a saucer shaped craft fleeing the area.;2012-11-06 14:00:00;15 minutes;Saw small stationary clouds forming from thin air,later saw a saucer shaped craft fleeing the area. As I am near Nellis AFB, I delight in watching all the aircraft.  On this day I watched a very loud B-1 bomber head out going NW and out of sight.  I thought it looked peculiar that there were only two very small clouds in the relatively clear low NW skyline.  So I'm looking,and two more small clouds formed from thin air in the same area.   After retrieving my binoculars to try and determine the source, I saw no aircraft but one more puff of cloud emerged similar to how shaving cream would come foaming out of a can.  These were not contrails,and if this were exhaust from an aircraft, it would have to be hovering, yet I saw no craft present near them.Just then two of the Thunderbird jet team entered into the air going roughly in that direction.   I continued to watch the area of the clouds as the jets went out of sight.Just then I saw a brownish green craft that appeared saucer shaped dart across the sky at sonic speed coming from that vicinity headed SW.Within minutes four! fighter jets emerged from the AFB, flew around near the area of the clouds,then returned to the base.The small clump of clouds that appeared from nowhere stayed as cloud vapor and did not dissapate as smoke might.I watched them slowly drift NW within the relatively calm air current for a half hour.I've never seen anything like this cloud birth before, and cannot possibly imagine an explanation for it.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
