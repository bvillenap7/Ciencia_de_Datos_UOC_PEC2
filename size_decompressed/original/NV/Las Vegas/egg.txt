I focused on them thinking they were birds, I relized that the objects were moveing faster than I think birds move. It was the way they moved, jeting back and forth kind of like they were danceing,or playing together in a small pattern. The color of these object's was kind of silver metallic,or gray. It was hard to tell because of the fact that they jeted around so fast. I would say they were about 1/2 mile up at the most,and egg shaped.And they stayed in a tight pattern. They never came to complete stop. And they were solid, could not aany lights comeing from them. You know that vegas has a lot of light and distraction, I just happen to be looking i the right area. To much noise to tell if they're was any sound comeing from them. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886

I saw something very unusual. I was traveling east on Sahara Blvd at approximatly 07:40 when I looked up and saw 20-30 flying black objects . These  objects were just under the cloud layer and were traveling NNW perpendicular to the wind. I at first thought they might be birds or balloons . However, I watched them move in  a loose but excact formation for approximatly 5 minutes then they all simply took off in different dirrections at tremendous speed. It was highly unusual.;36.1461363312205;-115.193517511886
