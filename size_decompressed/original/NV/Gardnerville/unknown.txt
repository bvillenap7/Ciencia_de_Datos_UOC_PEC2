Noticed flashing lights out my kitchen window along with beams of light , projectiles and meteors falling near by.  ((Sirius??));2009-11-30 22:15:00;continuous;Noticed flashing lights out my kitchen window along with beams of light , projectiles and meteors falling near by After drinking some orange juice before bed I noticed a cluster of changing lights(red,green,blue,yellow and white) in the distance to the east through the window.  Upon closer examination I realized I was looking at something other than a star or aircraft.  It was moving in a diamond pattern then stopping and staying stationary, emitting bright beams of light and what appeared to be projectiles that left a copper colored sparkle trail until they faded.   I dressed myself, grabbed the video camera and exited to the outside when I noticed what looked like meteors falling extremely close to said cluster of changing lights.  At this time I am monitoring every fifteen to 20 minutes to see if there is any changes.  So far it has gained more altitude. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Sirius.
