I was driving my car looking south on a residential road. It was a clear day with not one cloud in the sky. There was this really shiny, almost if it was aluminum, object probably 25000-30000 feet high, headed west and a pretty fast speed. My friend's girlfriend and I were watching it for about a 50 seconds then i went behind a tree because i was driving her home, and when we looked back up in the sky it was no where to be found. It just disappeared. We scanned the sky for another 5 minutes or so to see if it was anywhere, but it was no where to be found. What else could it be?!!?!?!;38.8735045070423;-119.61928140845

They were in a straight line, evenly spaced, with no flashing lights like a normal aircraft displays. We observed them for about two minutes, then they just disappeared.;38.8735045070423;-119.61928140845
