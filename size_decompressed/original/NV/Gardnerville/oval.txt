My wife and I were in the back yard of our residence in the afternoon about 6:00 pm.   My wife looked up and noticed what appeared to be a jet fighter (maybe an f16) following a silver colored object that was not leaving a vapor trail like the jet was.  She went into the house and got her camera which was a canon 7D with a 70/200 lens with a 2X extender.   The objects were coming from the south and when she returned with her camera, the objects had passed over our house headed in a northwest direction over Lake Tahoe.  She snapped a picture of the jet but the object it was chasing did not get into the picture.  She then tried to take a shot of the silver object being chased but when she took the shot the object morphed into a circular orange colored ball that she did get a picture of.  Within a second or two the orange ball disappeared.  I will email the  pictures to you.  Note that the pictures have been slightly modified with Adobe Photoshop in order to zoom in on them, sharpen them and enhance the contrast.   I am a retired computer programmer and Vietnam vet.  My wife is also retired and is currently a wildlife photographer.  I hadn't considered reporting this to anyone, but I heard on the Art Bell show that there had been a lot of sightings of orange balls in the sky so thought I would share a report of this incident.;38.8735045070423;-119.61928140845
