As my wife and I exited our vehicle at our residence in Gardnerville, Nevada, my wife told me there was something strange in the sky.  I looked up in a southerly direction and observed three lights, green in color, in a triangular formation.   All the lights would go out, then the one (front) light would flash, then the two other lights would flash, then all the lights would appear to oscillate then go off with no apparent pattern.   This object appeared to be motionless and in a stationary position.   After ten to fifteen minutes, the object faded from view.;38.8735045070423;-119.61928140845
