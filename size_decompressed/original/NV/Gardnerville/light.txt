I am now a retired police officer. At the time of the event I was still serving as a police offficer. I was on my way to work, on my motorcycle. At the time the area was very rural area. There were no other vehicles on the road, no street lights and no homes in the area. I observed a very brillant bluish/white light streaking toward the earth. The object was about one mile wsw of the intersection of Hwy. 88 and Kimmerling road and at an elevation of no more than 3,000 feet. I recall thinking to myself, Wow! this shooting star is going to impact the surface. Wanting to witness the impact, I stopped to watch and had thought it might be interesting to try and recover some segment of the object. At about that time, the object stopped it's almost verticle descent and shoot up at a forty-five degree angle in a nnw direction. the object remained brilliantly bright during the entire incident. I watched in awe as it streaked out of sight and the brillance of it's display faded. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.8735045070423;-119.61928140845
Orange and Red object seen from Gardnerville Nevada 12/01/06.  6 Witnesses in Nevada/California;2006-12-01 21:10:00;36 minutes;Orange and Red object seen from Gardnerville Nevada 12/01/06.  6 Witnesses in Nevada/California At 21:10 I was driving home and as I looked left at an intersection, I saw a bright orange light with a section of red.  It was in the south east of my location, and it was headed northwest.  I proceeded the short distance home, grabbed my Steiner binoculars and looked at it.  There were no FAA lights on this thing (no red or green blinkers).  Not knowing the physical demension, I could not estimate the altitude it was at.  There was no sound.  I awoke two different neighbors, one being a past pilot and aerospace engineer.  Neither could I.D. the thing.  It started a very slow arc to the west, and then south west.   When I lost it over the Sierra Nevada mountain range, I decided to call a friend in Brentwood, (northern)California to see if he could spot it. I explained where he should look when he went outside his home.  As he took the phone outside, he saw it.  Still headed in a south by southwest direction, and appearing very large.  He awoke two of his neighbors, and his own family to witness the sighting.  When I ended my call to him at 22:16, it was still visible to him.;38.8735045070423;-119.61928140845
a bright light in the night sky started to move in a zig zag counter clockwise pattern, hovering in one spot occasionaly.;2010-07-06 01:20:00;15-20 min;a bright light in the night sky started to move in a zig zag counter clockwise pattern, hovering in one spot occasionaly. I was spending my night off of work at the park because that is the best place to see the stars clearly (i like to behold existence). anyways, i was looking up at the stars and what i thought was a particularly bright star started to zigzag in a counter- clockwise motion.  it moved on and off again in the same pattern for the duration of about 15-20 minutes, finally coming to rest in it's original position. I'm not trying to put my contact info!! I live about 10 miles south east of lake tahoe so, from my perspective, the incident appeared in the night sky over the Heavenly Ski Resort, above the mountain outline.  It was changing colors from whitish to red and blue very rapidly, and during the incident it appeared that part of it detached and flew off unbelievibly fast, but it was hard to be certain.;38.8735045070423;-119.61928140845
