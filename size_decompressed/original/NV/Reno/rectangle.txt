Large rectangle, invisible apart from its outline;2007-09-27 14:00:00;30 seconds;Large rectangle, invisible apart from its outline About 2 o'clock, Saturday afternoon, bright blue sky.  Bright sun.  Looking at commercial airliner traveling north to south through binoculars.  As I followed the plane, I saw a large rectangular shape in the same area as the plane.  I could only see the outline of the rectangle, the inside was the same color as the sky. The outline was like the edge of a window, thicker and collecting the light. The rectangle was about the same height as the plane, but was 3 to 4 times the length of the plane. I followed the plane for a second and went back to the object. It was in the same place but it must have turned.  What was visible now was a tall, thin triangle of similar visibility.  I dropped the binoculars, could not see the object, and when I looked through the binoculars I could not see the object.

The craft was west in the sky at the 10 oclock position hovering not moving, then suddenly dropped in a swift movement unlike a helicopter.  Then hovered, then slowly dropping then darted left at a 45 degree downward angle then stopped quickly, the movement this was making where almost jerky very quick manuvers it excelerated and stopped very percisely.   The lights where to large to be position lights on a plane or helicopter, it came to a sudden stop then dropped while exelerating down toward the ground it appeared as if it was going to crash i could not see the lights it was moving to quickly behind the trees.  This was not like anything ive ever saw I was a aircraft mechanic in the USAF on the SR-71 and 33 dept of defence aircraft and nothing moved like this.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

When it came closer above me it looks like a flying square building with about 10 floors of yellow gold lights and red and green lights at the bottom.  Didn't have chance to take video as it happened so fast!;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
