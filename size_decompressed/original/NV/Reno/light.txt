shooting star does a 180, and makes off axis shifts over reno.;1981-06-01 22:30:00;1 min+;shooting star does a 180, and makes off axis shifts over reno. we saw what looked like a blue shooting star leaving a trail entering the atmosphere, but the light reversed direction, and flew south to north almost directly over our heads at a slow speed, but making very rapid 90 degree off axis shifts. we watched it cover some 20 miles. then it veered 90 degrees over the the east horizon at incredible speed, and disappeared. i would estimate the altitude of the object to be 5-15 thousand feet above grade, it clearing peavine mountain behind us by atleast 5000 feet.

square green flourscent light projecting a control beam of light by speed and depth from the sky to ground;1983-06-15 20:00:00;5 minutes;square green flourscent light projecting a control beam of light by speed and depth from the sky to ground at 20:00 on a nevada dirt road we saw a flourscent green square light, 75 feet in the air, and 75 feet off the road, about 45 degrees from our vehicle. the light was green like a glow stick for emergency light, about 2' x 3' perfectly square. we stopped to see what it was, the square light began to control a beam of green light towards the ground, still keeping the perfect square shape! the beam slowly extended downwards at a very slow rate, inside of the square beam it looked like smoke or dust swirling around inside! the green square 2' x 3' beam came down to within 2 feet over the top of a sage brush bush and stopped, the sage brush bush was illuminated the purest white color i have ever seen. how can the bush be white, when the beam was green, what can control the speed, and depth of light? i got out to see if i could hear any motor noise, i was only 75 feet away, and there was zero noise!!! i could not make out any type of craft, only a square green box light that was producing a square green beam? we were freaked out and left driving into the heavy timber about a mile down the dirt road, even our 2 dogs were acting strange, almost cowarding down? about 45 minutes later when we calmed our nerves, we drove back to the spot, there was'nt anything there except for a flourscent green aura or cloudy area where the beam had been. i know this area better than the back of my hand, i have hung out there for many years, this was something not from this planet!!! i would like to talk to someone about it, i studied the scene for sometime during the sighting, this was 20+ years ago, and i still remember it like i was still there!!! i can be reached at home in the evenings at 775- ((telephone number and name deleted)), reno, nevada.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

It;2000-01-03 22:43:00;3 seconds;At 22:43 Jan 03, 2000 I observed in the night sky, a bright white object traveling at a very high rate of speed from north to south. It was as large as my thumb extended at arms length. At 22:43 Jan 03, 2000 I observed in the night sky, an object traveling at a very high rate of speed, flat on the horizon. It traveled from north to south. It came into my vision at a point just below and to the south of the North Star. It traveled below Cassiopia to a point just about exactly West of me. I am in Reno, Nevada. The object was very bright (not like a fireball)like a white light. It appeared at least as bright as Venus. It took only 3 sceonds to travel this great distance of sky. It's elevation was very difficult for me to even estimate. I was looking about 12 to 15 degrees above the horizon. The object was as large as my thumb extended at arms length. It didn't get appreciably brighter nor did it fade out. It just traveled at a high rate of speed in and out of vision. I watch satellites all the time. I can usually figure how high up they are and the characteristics they demonstrate. Including how long it takes them to travel across our sky at 17,500 miles per hour. This was traveling at many times that speed. Even if it was lower, it traveled many times faster than any planes I know of. Within a very short time after I saw this object two aircraft appeared in the sky going in the direction where Lost sight of the bright object. They were very large and traveling at the speed I would expect chase aircraft to travel at. The only thing is they had very bright lights on all the way accross the sky (unlike regular aircraft)and they made no sound. It was very quiet and there was no wind. I watch aircraft all the time and I know you can hear them in these circumstances. These made no sound. They did have, in addition to the regular appearing aircraft lights, red and white strobes. Two things were very strange however I watched the one that was traveling from North to south, in the direction of the object, for an inordinately long time and distance. I watch planes all the time and I know I cannot see them at such a distance and again I must mention they made no sound. The other aircraft appeard from the East and traveled west to the direction of the Object. I am a cool headed person in my fifty's. I  love the sky, planes and things celestial as did my mom before me. I have been observing the sky since I was a very young man. I don't know what I saw but I did see this interesting object and the craft I described. I felt I should report it. If it was Russian space junk entering the atmosphere, why the chase craft and what were they? Very large, lights on when they shouldn't be and NO SOUND. I hope this report helps.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

It traveled in that fashion until it moved behind a hill where I lost sight of it. The object had a flashing apearence like a diamond.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

I wiped off the window so my friend could see better in the dark and as I did so I noticed a very bright falling light.  My father having been an airforce man I know when it's a plane and when it's not.  I saw that the light was falling straight down at a very rapid speed and the light didn't flash at all.  The windows were rolled up so I couldn't tell if it had a sound or not.  Toward the last few seconds the object turned a bright red, fading into a yellowish orange, then to a bright green before disappearing over the mountains. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Multiple objects over Reno;2003-08-23 17:00:00;45 minutes;Multiple objects over Reno We were coming back from shopping and I was getting some groceries out of the car. I happened to look up and saw 2 stationary lights in the sky.  Both had the appearance of a star (about the brightness of Jupiter at night) and were roughly a few miles apart (best guess).  Neither had any color, the same color as starlight.  Common sense told me that they couldn't have been stars during broad daylight so out of curiosity I stood there and watched.  My first thought was that they were balloons very high up, but as I stood there and the minutes rolled by, I seriously doubted that as neither one had moved whatsoever.  I noticed, to my amazement, that the light closest to me had a very tiny light flying in circles rapidly around it.  That disappeared and the two lights just sat there motionless.  Neither of the two bright ones moved at all during this time.  I put the groceries away and came back out about 3-4 minutes later and noticed that the light that was farthest away had moved farther east of the other.  Neither was moving but I know for a fact that the one had moved while I was in the house, it was visibly noticable.  I sat watching for about 10 more minutes and nothing.  I found a pair of binoculars and had a look... both looked like stars... very high up and a simple dot of light, just like a star would look.  I went back in the house... and about 5 minutes later, curiosity got the best of me so I stepped back outside to have a look.  Both lights had completly vanished but there were about 4(?) very tiny lights flying around... all very small and much dimmer then the two before.  Hard to believe, but they were flying around each other... kind of a dogfight and I had the feeling that they were very high up.  As I watched they all kind of just faded and that was it.  Needless to say, I had a hard time processing what my eyes were seeing.  Anyway, there you have it.. thanks and had to tell someone.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Lights appear over football game in Northwest Reno;2003-09-05 20:45:00;30 Minutes;Lights appear over football game in Northwest Reno At a high school football game in Reno I was watching a game with a few friends, with the up coming air races there were a lot of planes out I saw a set of lights that I assumed was a plane.  They were a little brighter than a regular plane but I had written it off as being a low flying plane.  Within the first few seconds they grew to be as bright as a set of headlights.  Whenever I looked up from the game I could see that they were still there and they had turned slightly and had a bright gree light behind it and every once in a while a light would randomly blink.  I could tell the intensity of the lights because the street lights of the library just above the field were very dull compared to the set above.  The lights disappeared three minutes later and then they reappeared and disappeard for about another half hour.  A friend of mine also saw the lights right before they disappeared.  I was just wondering if anyone else in Northwest Reno had seen something similar.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

Lights north over Reno;2005-04-06 21:30:00;3.5 hours;Lights north over Reno It was around 9:30pm last night... I stepped out on my porch to put a mop into the storage area on my balcony,  facing roughly west (I live on the second floor in my apt complex on the south side of Reno)and I happened to look towards the right (which would have been roughly northwest (towards Northern NV/Northern CA).  To my amazement, I saw what appeared to be dozens of very small dots of light flying extremely rapidly around each other, left to right, horizontally and vertically and moving at a high rate of speed.  In front, and at about the same height as me, was the rental office roof, so I approximated the objects to be flying anywhere from 10 to 20 degrees above the horizon.  They were so low, in fact, that if you weren't at least on a second story with a clear view in that direction, you would have missed them altogether. Because they were only pinpoints of light it was very difficult for me to judge their distance... I even jumped in my jeep, camera in hand, and drove to the north end of town to see if I could get a better vantage point to view them, but with no success.   With the conditions, they could have been larger but farther away or smaller and closer, it was difficult for me to tell.  When I arrived back home, I stepped out on my porch and sure enough, they were still there! By this time, it was around 10:45pm.   These objects were seemingly just west of incoming air traffic to Reno/Tahoe airport (the commercial air traffic pattern brings them on the runway most of the time in a north to south direction).  It seems that Reno/Tahoe Intl. should have picked these objects up on radar or possibly sighting(s) by commercial airline pilots.   I sat there and exhausted myself for a rational explanation... they dove horizontally and vertically and almost seemed to be playing, heading toward each other and then dodging at the last minute, like playing chicken or something, if that makes any sense.  I thought they were perhaps birds, but these objects were self luminous and moving extremely fast (depending on the distance it would have been in the hundreds of miles an hour+ range and besides that it was night time!).   I thought of bugs or moths flying around a light source, but there was absolutely no light source that close to me, I even took a short walk to check.  Maybe an atmospheric phenomenon, although there isn't any type of atmospheric anomaly I could think of... it was partly cloudy out, no rain and a slight breeze but no electrical/lightning activity in the area.  I literally stayed up until these objects finally disappeared, which happened not all at once but over the course over an hour.   By 12:45am, there were only a couple left that I could see and then they also disappeared from view.  There were literally dozens of these objects and reminded me of fireflies buzzing around each other when I lived back east.  I checked the local online paper this morning for any unusual reports but nothing at all... which I was slightly disppointed in finding out.   Is there ANYONE else out there that saw this??  I'd really be interested in knowing.  I'm borrowing some binoculars today in case they reappear this evening.  PS... a couple of days ago I submitted another report about a sighting that I had along with my ex-wife about 10 yrs ago back by Angels Camp, CA.  I also submitted a report from August 23rd of 2003 about objects that myself and a girlfriend had spotted over Reno.  Last night included, this is cumulatively the fourth sighting in my life of something that I could not explain away.  I don't mind questions via the phone, I'm intrueged but wary about all of this, so if interested, I'd appreciate it if you could contact me through my email first. Thank you.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
I saw three strange lights moving erratically over the foothills behind my house, departing in different directions at different times.;2005-08-12 05:20:00;at least 20 minutes;I saw three strange lights moving erratically over the foothills behind my house, departing in different directions at different times. I was outside in the early morning watching the end of the meteor shower when I noticed two very unusually bright lights near the mountain behind my house that I at first dismissed as stars.  One was located to the West, the other toward the Northeast.  As the sky grew lighter,  I noticed that the lights had not moved from their positions, but the rest of the stars had.  Upon closer observation, I saw that the light in the Northeast was rising into the sky very very slowly, and was also darting slightly from side to side.  I then noticed a dimmer light a little below it also start to rise in the same manner, but almost immediately moved in an Easterly direction, disappearing shortly afterward.  Then the brighter light seemed to stop rising and just hovered, still making small darts from side to side.  I then started watching the other light to the West and noticed it was moving side to side as well.  This one, however stayed closer to the ground, only rising a bit, then sinking down again and again.  The movements were subtle, but it was undoubtedly moving. I have never heard of or seen any kind of vehilcle that moves like these lights did.  Both the lights I saw made no noise, and flickered at an irregular rate.  Each time they flickered, the color seemed to change slightly, from white to blue, to yellow, and I think red, too, but each color was so bright and blended together it was hard to tell.  I'm also pretty sure they changed shape slightly as they flickered.  The lights stayed like this for a while and all I could do was stare and try to process what I was seeing.  Eventually, the Northeast light seemed to move away East across the valley and I lost sight of it, so I kept watching the one to the West.  Almost as soon as the other light left, this light's movements became more pronounced, rising higher, then sinking, and moving back and forth along the hill.  Each time it sank lower and lower until I lost it behind the hill.  I immediately ran into my house, put on some shoes, and raced out into the desert to find it.  I ran around the hill I saw it disappear behind and saw the light again, still moving in the same manner, but it was moving away over the mountain at a steady pace.  All I could do was watch it zig zag farther and farther away.  It appeared to stop a few times as it did so, but it eventually rounded the side of the mountain and I could no longer see it.  I have always believed in UFOs but never actually thought I would see one.  I was raised in a good family, I get along well with my parents and sisters, and have never been known to lie about something like this.  I am not on drugs and do not have any mental disorders that would cause me to see this.  I still cannot believe what I've seen.  I have no rational explanation.  I feel like I must sound completely crazy since I'm the only person who saw this, especially on the night of a meteor shower.  I am absolutely positive, though, that these lights were not stars or meteors or airplanes or anything I've seen before.  I am absolutely dumbfounded.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

The aircraft was moving at a 90 degree angle from the sky towards the ground at a slow rate of speed. The aircraft made a small s pattern in the sky, almost like a woble.  There was not tail as if a meteor and was moving to slow.  At about 10-15,000 feet it shifted to a level flight with the ground.  After about 20 seconds in level flight it dimmed out.

The light was moving very fast with no sound whatsoever and eventually got brighter before vanishing without a trace.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

This is the 2nd time I have seen this light and it's not a shooting star. This is the second time I have seen this light. The first time I saw it was 2 months ago late at night.  It came from the south and was going north.  The first time I thought it was a shooting star but it held a constant elevation. I saw the same thing again tonight.  This is no shooting star and it make no noise at all.  The light is so bright and looks just like a star light, pure white and it stays on course without any elevation change at all. Has any one else seen this light.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Strange lights over Reno on Christmas eve;2010-12-24 19:30:00;1-2 minutes;Strange lights over Reno on Christmas eve My family and I were out driving around looking at Christmas lights on the east side of the valley/basin, when I looked out the window of our car and saw a few slow moving orange/yellow lights moving horizontal through the sky but below the mountain peaks, they looked like they were flying right through the middle of the valley.   I had my wife stop the car and i got out to try to get a better look with my binoculars as i watched them one by one go across to the middle of the valley then go up what seemed like a mile or two high above the mountain peaks and then begin moving horizontal again and fade out one by one and their was no sound from the objects.  They looked to be round in shape with slightly visible vertical panels.   The only other people I know who saw them from a differnt part of the valley was my brother and his wife with a few other people around them.   I placed calls to the local police and to the airport and nobody else had made a report and the airport said they didnt see anything.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Blue/green semi-circle light object near Washoe lake NV along 395;2011-09-11 05:30:00;3 min;Blue/green semi-circle light object near Washoe lake NV along 395 While driving southbound I noticed a bright blue light slightly east of the road, several miles away.  This is fairly hilly/mountainous terrain, and it was dark, so I assumed it was a light on a hilltop, or perhaps on a tower.  As I got close it became obvious the light was moving slowly from east to west.  I initially dismissed this as an optical illusion since there was no background other than dark night sky, but the road is pretty straight and the light clearly moved from the left to the right side of the road and got brighter. I alerted the rest of my family in the car, who also witnessed the object.  As we got closer we noticed that there was a blue light on one side and a green light on the other.  As we approached I saw what appeared to be a semi-circle of light with blue on the left and green on the right (from my perspective).  I could never make out any detail other than the lights.  I would estimate the object was less than 1000’ AGL.  I am a pilot with over 20 years of experience in military fighters.  The light configuration was unusual and did not conform to normal aircraft position lights (green/red on wingtips and white tail).;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

I you liv in the reno area, you are a fool if you don't stay up to see this. Its like a teloscope from the sky.  I belive the two objects are connected in someway and when i film the lights on my iphone they pulsate and freezed my screen at one point and it looms like a cloak is over something disgused by these lights.  At on point my i phone turned off after the strange video interfererance it has on my recording devices.  It's like a celestial sphere with the light asbits core.

The object was a bright light, light blue in color, and much brighter than a star or planet. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus?  PD));2012-09-16 05:10:00;arround 30 minutes;The object was a bright light, light blue in color, and much brighter than a star or planet. Spotted at about 5:10 am, Saturday morning, September 16, 2012. The object was a bright light, light blue in color, and much brighter than a star or planet appears in the night sky, maybe about twice the size of anything I have seen in the sky. I noticed it as I walked out in my backyard to have a smoke. The light appeared to be above the mountains in the SSW of the valley, which lead to Lake Tahoe, not sure how high. At first, I thought maybe it was Jupiter or another large planet, but my stargazer app showed Jupiter in the northeast sky and nothing significantly large or bright in the area where I was looking. After about a minute of admiring what I assumed was a strange bright star or planet, it began to move northward. It moved at a slow pace much slower than what I am use to seeing the average plain in the night sky move, also there were no flashing lights, and I could hear no noise, simply a brilliant light blue light floating across the sky. After it ! left my view from the back yard, which was obstructed by the roof of my house, I decided to go out front to see if it was still there and it was. The light appeared to still be traveling at the same rate of speed, but a few seconds after spotting the light in the front yard it stopped, this time hovering in the northeast sky. Exited that it might actually be a UFO, I ran in to grab a small “moongazer” telescope, set it up out front, and located the craft with a 20mm lens, but it still just looked like a light, so I tried a 12mm, 6mm, and 4mm lens in the telescope. Through the 4mm lens, I could see that it was emitting a bright blue glow, and had Blues, reds, oranges and other colors, which I could not quite make out, shimmering all around it, although it still looked like a ball of light. I am not too sure how long it stayed there because I went in to check on my daughter around 5:40 and when I came out to gather my telescope equipment the sun was rising. I could no longer ! tell if it was there.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

I look up in the sky over near where the Mt Rose highway would be, and there was this circle of light, almost like you were looking at a car headlight sideways.  It appeared that it was shining light through a smokey sky for about 7 seconds and then it slowly faded away.  I have never seen anything so bright and then to fade away slowly was bizarre.

Very large, bright white light with smaller bluish green and red lights;2015-02-18 18:00:00;30 minutes;Very large, bright white light with smaller bluish green and red lights To the west of Sun Valley, there was one very large bright white light, and two smaller bluish-green light and red lights toward the bottom right of the white light.  They were extremely high in the sky (from my perspective).  At one point while I was watching I also noticed a red light high above the large white light, like the smaller ones below.  They never moved for at least 30 minutes.   I was on the phone with my daughter, who was on the Reno side, about 10 miles to the west of me, and she was seeing the exact same thing.  But she said she was closer to being underneath them.  I went into the house for a short time, and when I came back out they were gone.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

Triangular light siting in the north east skies over Reno NV;2016-09-03 20:27:00;15 seconds;triangular light siting in the north east skies over Reno NV I had just finished setting up my 8 inch Celestron telescope and assembling my other night viewing equipment.  Celestron Skymaster binoculars and my 10x50 Nikon binoculars.,chairs and multiple wireless devices. I usually allow 30 to 45 minutes for my eyes to adjust to the dark however this event took me bu surprise. As I settled into my seat and started scanning the evening skies out of the dark 3 brilliant glowing white lights suddenly appeared. No slow build in intensity they just appeared. The 3 lights were in the shape of a perfect triangle. One on the top and two forming the bottom line of the triangle. My first thought was how interesting it is that 3 satellites suddenly appeared. I picked up my Nikon binoculars and focused on all 3. As I watched all 3 moved in a uniform pattern and never moved from the triangle shape they appeared in. My best guess is they appeared approximately 25 degrees above the skyline and close to 38 degrees north north east. As the triangle moved to the east the light intensity was consistent and brilliant. I continued to observe the 3 uniform lights for approximately 10 more seconds. By this time the lights rapidly faded to black at around 58 degrees north east. And as quickly as they appeared it's like someone hit the light switch. All 3 disappeared. Mr. Davenport, I perform this ritual nightly and have done so for at least 15 years. I know what satellites look like...I understand the way they move through the night skies and slowly faded out of view as the sun reflection passes. I'm not saying this was a UFO but I am saying I've never seen 3 satellites fly in formation and disappear all at once. Very bizarre event over the Northern skies of Reno NV. Take care sir!;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Red arcing flashing strobe light, noticed at night near where the hilltop beacons typically sit.;2017-11-19 22:00:00;7 minutes;Red arcing flashing strobe light, noticed at night near where the hilltop beacons typically sit. From my rooms window at night after work, as I was getting ready to go to bed I noticed, what I had initially thought was the red beacon hilltop light on the hill from the tower. (These beacon lights are on the tops of the foothills near Reno).  I realized however, that’s not what it was, and it began moving up, and down bobbing in the air (I estimated it to be about 1,000 feet off the flat ground, since it was bobbing just above the hilltop.  This is typically where I recall seeing the red beacon light on a nightly basis after work.  I sat still on my bed, and watched it, I noticed it had a slightly different glow to it, and then it started to strobe intermittently remaining bright red, but differently than the hilltop beacons, which I had not been able to notice for some strange reason at this time.   It’s strobe got larger until it discharged, a huge amount of red light all the way to the valley floor, arcing it downwards, as well as upwards, it did this ! massive strobe twice only.  It slowly, kept its bobbing motion up and down, it lightly diminished in brightness until it completely went out.   I had the feeling that someone else must have seen this, as it was so bright.  Not sure who was intended to see it, but it looked like performing some type of intermittent communication.  This could NOT have been a “Drone”, it had lots of palpable energy behind that output of light.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

Silent lights spiraling above Reno NV in clear night sky;2019-08-23 22:06:00;5-7 seconds;Silent lights spiraling above Reno NV in clear night sky I was sitting on my back porch listening to the radio and night sky watching when I observed what at first appeared to be a shooting star.  The light traveled from my left to my right about 5 degrees above the hilly horizon which site North East to East of my home.  The speed was much slower than a shooting star.  The light wasn't sharp or bright brilliant it was as if it was below the surface of the water or behind dairy glass.  It was only a white light as there were no green or red lights which you would see on an aircraft.  No engine noise at all, completely silent.  As the light moved left to right it passed behind a large tree.  Expecting it to come out from behind the tree, I looked to the right side of the tree.  It didn't come back into view.   I then observed the same blurred light flying back to the left and spiraling in a clockwise motion and climbing.  Then the light moved back in a right direction which is south.  Again I see it spiral back to the left and upward.  Now I'm thinking this is not a normal event and I glance down at my table and look for my phone.  I wanted to capture a few pictures if possible.  This is where I lost track of the light.  I didn't see it again.  This entire event lasted maybe 5 to 10 seconds.  I was unable to see a shape only the muted white glow. Thinking about this it was similar to watching a large spotlight on clouds.  However the night skies were absolutely clear..no fog, clouds...no haze or smoke present.  An absolutely beautiful night sky where the Milky Way was so clearly observed.  I'm at a complete loss trying to make logical sense of this sighting.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
10-12 equally spaced white &quotstars&quot moving in a linear formation.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-24 05:30:00;45 seconds;10-12 equally spaced white &quotstars&quot moving in a linear formation At approximately 0530 on 24 November 2019, I observed approximately 10-12 white stars moving from the Southwest to the Northeast in a perfect linear formation.  All of the stars were equally spaced between each other and traveling at a constant speed.  There was one star on the left flank of the formation approximately 8 stars back from the lead star.  There were no blinking lights observed, as they were all a constant star-like coloration.  The weather conditions were clear and no sounds were heard.  I am a retired military officer (23 years).  Based upon my extensive military experience, I am 100% confident that this was NOT a military aviation formation, as the speed of the stars and number of craft observed do not support a military aircraft scenario;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
