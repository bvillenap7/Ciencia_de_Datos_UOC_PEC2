Dimly lighted chevron object moving quickly over NW Reno.;2005-09-29 04:07:00;10 seconds;Dimly lighted chevron object moving quickly over NW Reno. The object was seen over the NW horizon from North of Reno.  It was a delta or chevron shaped object.  At first I thought it was a dimly lit flock of geese...then relaized it was moving extremely fast and actually had very dim lights.  I am outside a lot between 0345-0410 PDT for my job and this was by the far the weirdest thing I've ever seen.   It wasn't bright, but appeared close, and made no sound.  I just happened to catch it because I was watching the weather balloon I had just launched.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
V-shaped object hovering over Reno Nevada.;2014-10-12 16:15:00;5 minutes;V shaped object hovering over Reno Nevada While standing in the backyard of a rental property my fiance and I were considering. I looked up and saw a slow moving object traversing the sky from east to west.  It was V shaped and looked to be partially yellow in color.  The object seemed to flap sporadically as it moved.  Its altitude seemed the same as the average plane passing overhead.  The object hovered at a certain point for a few minutes before vanishing from sight.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Unlit, silent, slow hovering chevron shaped craft;2018-11-07 05:15:00;1 minute;Unlit, silent, slow hovering chevron shaped craft. Was out running, looked up and saw a dead silent chevron or boomerang shaped craft with no lights.  It looked like a very graceful, gigantic bird gliding slowly from east to west.   After seeing it the first time I kept looking up and either the same craft again or saw another one exactly like the first.  The second sighting was approximately 3 minutes after the first sighting.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
