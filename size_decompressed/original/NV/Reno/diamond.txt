Diamond, Spherical UFOS over Reno;2008-08-22 15:50:00;30 mins.;Diamond, Spherical UFOS over Reno Sitting on a lawn chair looking north towards Sun Valley I noticed a single circular sphere of light during the afternoon. There were some chemtrail clouds drifting south. The sphere moved very slowly towards me in over the downtown Reno metropolitan area. It took up a position over McCarren Blvd. and remained motionless for approx. 5 mins. It then moved closer to my position on a straight course but ever so slowly. At first I thought it was a balloon but it maintained its course on a straight trajectory. It stopped over the northern Sparks area and held position. It seemed to emminate its own white luminious light source. It appeared under intelligent control. Suddenly off to my left appeared a diamond [mother-of-pearl] shaped craft. It seemed to have dimensional structure to its outer shape. I glissened and gleamed various beautiful colors in the late afternoon sunlight.  One moment it seemed to look like a triangle then would alter its dimensional features appearing more diamond shaped. It moved with the same slow movemnt as the first sphere which was also visible at the same time the diamond was overhead. The diamond moved forward ever so slowly then took up position over the University of Reno. It remained stationary for 6-7 mins then began a very slow path floating back and forth slightly. It then began it final course 90 degs to it previous path heading west. It was the same altitude as the clouds [chemtrail clouds] which were blowing east in the wind. But the diamond was moving AGAINST the wind as it advance head-on past the clouds. I watched it till it was out of sight. This all took approx 25-30 mins.  The first sphere also was now undetectable by vision. It was also gone.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

This happened during sunlight, daytime. I was praying as I normally do prior to entering freeways, and this appeared.  Never seen anything like it.  Dont know if anyone else saw it, as I was driving.  It measured approximately 3 ft height x 2 ft width;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
