Sphere with Spikes;1999-12-27 19:30:00;4 minutes;Sphere with Spikes Coming home for Christmas on 12/27/99 my brother and I were driving east on Interstate 80 over the Sierra Nevada Mountains, when I noticed a large bright light coming of the mountain top, coming from the south. As the object came closer it appeared to get larger, very bright, and spikes coming out of it. I was the passenger in the car, my brother driving. I couldn`t believe what I`m seeing, so I told my brother who is driving to look to right up the mountain. I needed him to view the object because his eyes are better than mine. He seen everything I did and confirmed what I was looking at. Of course I viewed it longer, because he had to drive. I was getting a little scared at what I was seeing because it was getting closer to us. Well we lost sight of it at that point, because of our distance traveling. We did see the object one more time about three miles more up the road, but at more of a distace away. Then if disapeared. I would say this object was at least, 300 yards in diameter. The strange part of all this is, we forgot about seeing this object. It wasn`t until 4 months later that it popped back into my head. I can home that day and asked my brother about it again, he said he forgot about it also, untill I had reminded him of the event. about me:I`m 44 years old and Iv`e worked for General Motors for the last 23 years, and I consider myself very level headed, as for my brother.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
A small white sphere which stopped, hovered for 5 minutes, then took off and disapeared.;2002-10-11 13:25:00;10 minutes;A small white sphere which stopped, hovered for 5 minutes, then took off and disapeared. I was walking my dog just before the sighting and looked at my watch and it was either 1:35 or 2:35 pm. He distracted me and forgot to check again. I was looking almost straight up while watching a white jet lay a chemtrail going from north to south. It passed overhead and slightly behind it I noticed movement. I saw a small white sphere at high altitude going about half the speed of the jet. It was travelling east to west. It moved much like a satelite looks at night. When it was almost staight overhead it seemed to slow down. It came to a dead stop almost directly overhead and stayed there about 5-10 minutes. I ran into my apartment and grabbed a cheap disposable camera and took a picture. Then I ran back in and grabbed my binoculars. The sphere was still overhead and I tried once to spot it thru the binoculars but failed. I found it again but before I could bring them up to my eyes the sphere started moving west again. It picked up speed for a short way then blinked in and out of my vision about three times and disapeared. It was a clear blue sky where it was located and I was looking north. It stopped shortly after crossing the north to south chemtrail and seemed to be at a much higher altitude. Size: if I held my hand out at arms length it would be about1/3-1/2 the with of my fingernail.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Moving star-like object seen in daytime sky.;2003-08-23 15:00:00;2 minutes;Moving star-like object seen in daytime sky. I was out on my back patio. I looked up in the sky and saw what I thought could possibly be a balloon. I looked at it longer and realized that it looked more like a moving star. It was a whitish-silvery color. I called to my husband to come take a look at it but by then it had gone behind a cloud. It moved pretty fast in a straight line. I didn't give it much thought until now. It was quite strange and I am sure that it was in fact not a balloon. I am a 24 year old stay at home mom. I don't have a lot of interest in UFOs and the like but I thought this was worth sharing.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
While looking out my living room, I saw a glowing red UFO come down and land on a few branchs, then flew off northwards at high speeds;2004-06-25 22:00:00;at home;While looking out my living room, I saw a glowing red UFO come down and land on a few branchs, then flew off northwards at high speeds Whlie I was playing with my new binoculars, I looked away for a second, then looked again and saw a small red apple like object come down from the sky and land on a group of small branchs. Then I looked for a few seconds then I told my brother to come see this object.  By the time he got there it flew away towards the north a high speeds.  A couple of years later, while watching Unsloved Mysteries I saw a ufo that looked like that one I saw but bigger. Which got me thinking about the UFO that I saw.  Then I begin going over what anyone would say about the UFO that I saw. I started by thinking that it can't be a laser because it was too big to be one,or that it was an illuion.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

Black Sphere moving silently west against wind currents;2008-02-28 15:00:00;3 Minutes;Black Sphere moving silently west against wind currents Black Sphere object originated in south traveling due north.   The black sphere was traveling about the speed of a turbo prop plane, but silent.  Faster than a helicopter, but slower than a jet.  It continued on a calm windless day north, then turned 90 deg. to the west and continued west at the same speed until it just disapeared into the distance.  It did not move like a balloon, and traveled the wrong direction for a balloon, prevailing upper winds were heading east.   It left no contrails like a jet much higher at the same time.   I took pictures with a 6M digital camera, and zooming into the picture reveals only a black sphere.   I have no idea what it was.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

It flew away at such a high speed that it couldn't have been a plane or hellicopter. it was too big to be a meteorite and it flew away from the earth;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

2 small, silvery spheres over Reno, NV, 3 times faster than jet,, appear and disappear out of clear blue sky.;2013-02-28 15:30:00;~8 minutes;2 small, silvery spheres over Reno, NV, 3 times faster than jet,, appear and disappear out of clear blue sky. I would like to report a UFO sighting which my husband and I had this afternoon, February 28, 2013, approximately 3:30 p.m.  Big, puffy, white clouds and blue sky.  Bright sunshine. We were sitting outside at our picnic table, talking. I was drinking iced tea, he had beer, and we enjoying the warm, sunny weather, when I commented on the jet passing over our heads.  It seemed to be rather low, or very large.  As we were looking up, He said, There's an object!! and pointed.   I looked up, and didn't see anything unusual, Where?  There!!!  An object!!  I squinted and looked harder, and my eyes fell upon a tiny, silvery white spot in the blue sky, just on the edge of a cloud.  Wow!  What is it? I don't know!! So, I jumped up and ran in for the 2 binocular cameras we have for bird watching. When I came out, it was still there.  The cloud had moved, but the object was in the same spot.  We each took a camera and tried to focus on the shiny object.   We could see it better, but it was still only a shiny round sphere, hanging in the sky.  It was not bouncing or moving and appeared too large to be a mylar balloon.   When I tried to click a photo of it, my batteries were dead, same with the other camera!  That's when another commercial jet came from the north.   I jumped up to run into the house to grab my Canon Rebel with 300 zoom lens.   He yells, It's going!,  as I ran into the house. When I came back out carrying the zoom camera, he said again, It's going!  It's moving like a bat outta hell! I tried to catch it with the zoom lens and focus, but it was moving too fast.  But, I clicked a picture in case it could get SOMETHING.  He exclaimed, It's going!   When that plane appeared, it took off like a bat outta hell!!  3 times faster than the plane!!   Suddenly, another one appeared right behind it, out of the clear blue sky!!  The first one did a swoosh upward and toward the southeast, and the second one also did a swoosh upward and to the southeast, exactly like the first!  They disappeared right before our eyes!  He commented, They were going 3 times faster than the jet!  Can you believe that?!!  We saw a UFO!!  What do you think of that?!!   All I could say was, Cool!!;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

I saw a Spherical, metallic object hovering one or two thousand feet up in Reno, NV.;2018-06-04 14:00:00;2-3 minutes;I saw a Spherical, metallic object hovering one or two thousand feet up in Reno, NV. I was driving from Carson City to Reno, and when I was in the central area of Reno, I recall seeing a metallic, spherical object floating about 1-2000 feet in the air.  It remained still until I could not see it anymore.  I took pictures but weirdly I deleted them thinking I saw a balloon, something I never would have done.  I never even thought about it again until recently.  My mother had seen similar things in that time period as well.  I may be remembering it wrong, but it looked like a droplet of liquid for a few seconds, but I'm not sure as it could have been reflecting sunlight.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

About 30,000 feet I saw two spheres flying in formation easily the size of a jumbo jet in diameter.  They were flying in formation at an incredible speed coming from the north by north west on a southern trajectory.  They were gone in less than 7-8 seconds.  I also saw in the north an airline aircraft going west to east.  I calculated the airliner was going in the area of 475-500 m.p.h. I used that rough calculation to estimate the speed of the spheres at 4-5 times the speed of the airliner.  They looked very much like large pearls.  They made no noise.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

One flew by and I jumped up to see it better and it disappeared behind a tree.  I laid back down on the bench and another flew by not to long after.  Same thing.  I hopped up and lost it behind the tree. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
