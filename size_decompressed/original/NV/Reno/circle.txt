It was large enough for me to notice that it was a disk or spherical shaped object.  My attention was drawn to the window next to my bed, where it moved slowly enough for me to notice its size and color.  What threw me were the sparks that flew off the back, and the sort of wavy outline of the disk.  I live just north of Reno, in Stead, NV--just 10 miles from the California border.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

Bright white disc of light the size of a full moon approximately shot straight up into the sky & disapeared in less than 1 sec.;2003-11-06 19:50:00;one minute;Bright white disc of light the size of a full moon approximately shot straight up into the sky & disapeared in less than 1 sec. At 7:45 p.m., I went outside to my back yard (in the northwest foothills above the city of Reno) to have a cigarette before my room-mate and I watched Survivor at 8 p.m. It was a clear sky, many stars, no moon up yet.  A bright white light almost directly above me and to the east a bit was moving slowly north, northwest.  It was roughly the size, maybe slightly larger, than a full moon, but the moon wasn't up yet at that time, and this was moving.  Not knowing the actual size of this object, it's difficult to say how high up it was, but if I had to guess, I'd say  between 500 and 1,000 feet.  (Since I live in the mountains, I'm already at approximately 5,000 feet.) There was no sound or noise of any kind.  I watched it for about  ten seconds, then it suddenly shot straight up into the sky and in less than one second, it was the size of any average star in the sky, then gone. Being a former Air Force brat and having spent 18 years growing up on various AF bases, I've seen and heard just about anything the AF flies, but I've never seen anything move at a rate of speed like that. I'd like to know if there were any other reports of this sighting from Reno or Sparks that night. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the date of the alleged sighting was in the year 2003.  We have altered the date above to 2003.  PD));39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

The night was partly cloudy, and the night sky was twilight.  There was only one star visible. My house street runs west to east, I am standing across the street setting up my HDD recorder, I would be looking south to film my house. I started filming at 17:00 hour. The second song to play is Wizards in winter and that’s when the object appeared at about 17:08.  I first saw the object way before it entered in to the view finder. It was bright and very bold looking in the sky, as nothing could compare to its size or speed.  Best way for me to explain its size is if a star is pin size the object would be pea size.  I can’t imagine it saw it for more than 5 seconds.  It disappeared behind the clouds and I saw it again through the opening of clouds for maybe another second then it went be clouds again.  The object itself seemed to go bright to dim, there was no after burn or anything behind its movement.  Meteors, space junk, don’t know, hopefully there is a logical explanation.

Lights seen hovering over rural Nevada community, witnessed by nearly a dozen residents.;2013-11-17 17:00:00;1 hour;Lights seen hovering over rural Nevada community, witnessed by nearly a dozen residents. Three lights were seen in the sky near Reno NV., by approximately 10 people all living in different households.  The objects were high in the sky but very bright and visible with the naked eye. The objects appeared to be rounding (circular) in shape and had glowing rings around each of them.  The light coming off of the circle shaped item was extremely bright and non-reflective.  The center appeared to be dark and almost perfect in shape. The objects appeared to be equal distances from each other forming a large triangle however they did not appear to be connected to each other.  They remained stationary for approximately one hour or slightly less and then disappeared at the same time. One of observer is a retired Air Force member with a law enforcement background.  Others include business owners, a Pharmaceutical Rep, House wife, and a Truck Driver. We have photos of the lights.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Bright cicularobject/light moving slowly in center of sky, then slowly eastward;2014-04-02 19:20:00;50 minutes;Bright cicularobject/light moving slowly in center of sky, then slowly eastward Saw neighbor very excited setting up telescope.  Asked if something was going on tonight in the sky.  He said he was setting up telescope to see what the ufo was in the sky.  Pointed to location.  It was in the southern potion of the sky.  Slowly moved to the central potion of the sky.  It was slowly moving north.   Ran into the house to get another camera, saw that it was now slowly (almost drifting) eastward.  Wasn't able to set up our telescope in time.  Recorded it with camera and took pictures.  The camera just caught a circular silverish object that looked as though the setting sun was reflecting on it.   When the sun completely set, we were no longer able to see it.  When looking at it through the close up camera lens, it was circular with black straight lines on the top of the circle and on the bottom of the circle.  Picture a circle in an outline of a square, and erase both the left and right sides of the square, leaving the top and bottom lines over and under the circle.   Didn't hear any noise.   It moved way too slow to be any type of human air vessel.  Moved even too slow to be a satellite. It also wasn't on a straight path.  I've seen satellites many, many times.  I've never seen one look like this.  It was bigger than satellites are and moved just way too slow.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
5-8 objects over Reno, NV.;2014-06-05 14:20:00;~60 seconds;5-8 objects over Reno, NV. Using my 20 x 80 Celestron Skymaster binocs, while observing a large 4 engine jet heading south, I saw these objects pass in the opposite direction.   These objects appeared to be moving at the same rate of speed in formation.  The formation was in a broken arrow shape.  Maybe 4 in a line with 2 or 3 offset.  I followed the formation from my chair and saw the offset 2 or 3 objects move ahead of the group to create an almost even line side by side.   The best I can describe them objects is a small can shape.  Shiny and silvery with a white and almost orange bottom.  The skies where clear and sunny.   When I stood to follow the formation I lost view and was never able to find the formation again.  While I could have mistaken weather balloons I've never seen a cluster of balloons.  And I've never seen balloons maneuver like this.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

After exiting my house I noticed a brilliant full moon with some visible stars and scattered clouds in the sky.  The newspaper had not been delivered yet and then I noticed a bright light that appeared to be bobbling and weaving around.  The light had a red light at the rear or on the top of it.  I returned to the house and recovered my 7 x 35 binoculars and went outside again to view the object more.  It continued to bobble to and fro, up/down, and around. It stayed within approximately a quarter mile radius.  While watching the object I observed a dim orange light approach the brighter white light which did not blink or flash.  The orange lights came different directions to the white light, circled around it and then sped rapidly away in many directions.  This occurred during my observation of all objects until I quit watching approximately 05:45 PST.  My spouse a! lso observed the objects. Location of objects:  The bright non-pulsing white light with the red light on the top or rear was located approximately 240 degrees in the Southwest direction from my property.  It appeared to be 15-20 degrees above the Sierra Nevada mountains (Carson Range) above Lake Tahoe.  I estimate the objects to be 10 to 15 miles distance from my property during the sighting.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

I grabbed binoculars and I could tell that the spot was a light ring, like a circular fluorescent light.   Two commercial planes passed beneath the white ring and they appeared smaller than the ring.  The curious thing was that the ring did not move at all. . . Anything I know to be that high in the air moves at least a little bit, even a hovering helicopter or a tethered balloon.   I measured this object from my roof for 20 minutes and it did not move a slight amount.  I have been watching it for about an hour and no movement.  While it is hard to see beyond the light ring with my binoculars, it kind of appears that there is a metallic body in the center.   I had my wife and two children see it as well.  I took a picture with a cell phone magnified 8 times so it is clear to see the dot, but not magnified enough to see the light ring in the image.   Wish I had more powerful zoom equipment - do you have any resources? ((NUFORC Note:  Photo shows a small, white blob in the daytime sky.

Four glowing cirlces low in the sky in south Reno.;2018-05-04 23:59:00;3-4 minutes;Four glowing cirlces low in the sky in south Reno. I had just arrived home from work around midnight, from May 4 going into May 5.  Low in the sky, over my neighborhood in South Reno, I saw a bright red light in the sky toward the west and a little north.  The light seemed more to radiate, like heat or energy. It wasn’t a steady solid “lightbulb” type of light.  It moved, sometimes hoovering, from north to south, before moving up at a 45-degree angle and dimming out high in the sky.  This lasted about a minute.  A second or two after this first light disappeared, three more (identical) appeared, in the same general section of sky as the first.  Two of these lights traveled as a pair, a little higher in the sky than the first one, and the third lagged a little lower than the others.  However, they moved across the same section of sky from north to south, hoovering a little and moving slowly before taking the same angular rise and dimming out.  This lasted about 2 to 3 minutes.  There was no noise, no humming or engi! ne sound.  The light was steady, though it moved like it was “radiating”.  My background: I am college educated, have worked for a major airline, and as an EMT.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
