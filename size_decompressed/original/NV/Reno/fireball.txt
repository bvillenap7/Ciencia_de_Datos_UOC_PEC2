A Meteor with a Difference.;1999-09-01 21:30:00;1 minute;A Meteor with a Difference. About 21:30 PDT on Sept. 1, 1999 I was standing in my backyard next to my car, drinking a coke when I saw a meteor with a pale, golden white glow, about a quarter the size of my fist, came from the northwest at about the speed of a fighter jet. I expected the meteor to disintigrate, as most do after they fall to the earth, but as it approached zenith, the object began to have a  glowing white trail after it, so I assumed it was a fighter jet, but the object made no sound like a jet and made no jet trail. A little past zenith, in the eastern part of the sky the object began to slow down and without any indication, the object split into four separate parts, a bright, large portion that continued on the original path of northwest to southeast, and three smaller pieces that went northeast, northwest and southeast. The smaller pieces from the object were just like the original, except they were smaller and they were yellow instead of gold. Almost immediately after ejecting the ! three smaller objects, the large one vanished, then the other three objects vanished a half second later. The object, which became three seperate, but similar objects was visible in the sky for about a minute, and after it was over I finished drinking my coke and went inside my home.  I thought nothing else about this event until two days later on September 3 when my father mentioned an object had been seen on Wednesday and had been talked about on Art Bell's program, something I'd not heard that night. I told him the story and it turned out that I had seen the object which had been reported.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Large fireball spotted over Nevada;2001-09-28 08:15:00;5-10 min;Large fireball spotted over Nevada I was looking to the east, when I noticed a very bright white object in the sky, heading east.  I got my binnoculars to get a better look, and it looked as if it were something coming through and burning in the atmosphere.  I could vaguely make out a small dark spot at the front core, but the rest of it looked like a huge fireball with tails or trails coming from either side.  I watched it continue to travel to the east until it went behind the clouds.  I am not saying it was a flying saucer, because it didn't look like one... no metal object, just a huge fireball. I am just curious as to what it was, if anyone has information.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Blue-white fireball comes down on Reno, Nevada;2005-02-10 21:30:00;5 seconds;Blue-white fireball comes down on Reno, Nevada I was working in my home office after dinner. My window right over my desk looks directly west over Reno. A bright light caught my eye, and I looked out. A large fireball / meteor type of thing was coming down -- looked like straight down. Its brightness was about like a car headlight from a half-block away. It appeared to go down between here and the Reno airport. The airport is about three miles west there is farmland & wetlands between here and there. I went outside and whatever was there was now gone. Lots of dogs barking. Nothing on the local news, so I figured I'd post a report and see if anybody else saw it. Probably a natural thing, but it's the brightest and biggest such thing I've ever seen in a city.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Fireball seen in sky over SE Reno.;2005-09-30 18:45:00;less than a minute;Fireball seen in sky over SE Reno. Yesterday evening I was heading home. I'd say it was about 6:45 pm, just starting to get dark. I had my 5 year old son in the truck with me. Up in the southeast sky we saw a red fireball falling from the sky. It looked like it was going down right behind Rattlesnake Mountain (for those of you who are familiar with the Reno area.) It looked a lot like a shooting star, the way it moved, with sort of a trailing tail behind it. But it was red.  If I were to hold a coin out at arm's length, it would take a silver dollar to completely block the view of the object.  Just to give an idea of the size.  As for a little background on me, I am in my early thirties and I don't have much interest in UFOs at all. My wife told me I should report this.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Large round glowing yellow fireball traveling at a high rate of speed, then suddenly stopping and disappearing;2008-04-29 20:00:00;6 seconds;Large round glowing yellow fireball traveling at a high rate of speed, then suddenly stopping and disappearing At appproximately 8:00 p.m. on Tuesday, April 29, 2008, I had just left Reno, NV heading eastbound on I-80 towards Elko, NV. A large perfectly round glowing object caught my eye as it came into my field of vision above me in my front window of my car heading the exact same direction at an extremely fast speed. At first I thought it was a falling star beacuase of the speed that it traveled across the sky, but then I realized it was traveling way too low and it was way too large, and it was glowing yellow not white as typical of the falling stars I have seen often. At that point my mind told me it must be a meteor but here was absolutely no trail behind it. Then it came to a sudden halt but never diminished in brightness, and then just totally became invisible, like it turned its light off. I got I weird gut feeling like this was something I could not explain. Everyone in the car was freaking out because they were all equaly scared. The only other time I had this feeling was in Seattle ,WA in May 1977 at approxiamtely 9:00 p.m. when a small craft the size of a small car followed our car full of five people through a road with tall trees on both sides just floating behind our vehicle, you could see it in the rear view mirror. It was a typical saucer like design that consisted of four rows of glowing windows. Our car died in the middle of the road and we were not able to start it for about a minute. Everyone was hysterical and terrified. Just was curious if anyone else saw the Reno meteor/light in the sky?;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Bright light observed over Reno, Nevada.  Disappears suddenly.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS sighting.  PD));2009-07-25 21:08:00;1 minute;Bright light observed over Reno, Nevada.  Disappears suddenly. While outside I happened to notice a bright, slow moving light to the south east of my house.  It seemed to be heading down, towards Earth.  My first thought was that it was a helicopter, but it's movement was much more steady and there was no noise.  Also, it was one bright light, whereas helicopters tend to have a few different colors on them.  About a minute after I first spotted it, an airplane was heading our direction and it disappeared quite suddenly. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS sighting.  PD));39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

We saw two bright fire lights shoot up to the sky at a fast steady rate until they disappeared behind the clouds.;2013-01-05 20:10:00;~2 minutes;We saw two bright fire lights shoot up to the sky at a fast steady rate until they disappeared behind the clouds. My sister and brother-in- were walking to my car to leave for the store. When my sister-in-law said to look up ahead at some lights going up in the sky.  We both instantly looked towards the sky about south, southwest, and saw 2 huge bright fire lights going up in the sky at a fast steady pace. At first, one of them was going a little faster than the other.  Then after a minute they were even with each other. They kept going at the same pace the whole time.  And they stayed the same brightness until we couldn't we couldn't see them passed the clouds. We aren't quite sure what it was.  One of us said maybe lanterns or hot air balloons, but they were going pretty fast and in a steady direction.  It was barely breezy out, and about 27F degrees.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Two large fireballs streak across the sky over Reno, NV.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.  PD));2016-07-27 21:40:00;40 seconds+;Two large fireballs streak across the sky over Reno, Nevada. Just 15 minutes ago, (at around 9:40 p.m) I was sitting in my apartment and just happened to look outside my window and saw 2 large orange fireballs with long tails slowly streak across the Reno, Nevada sky.  They were coming from the soutwest and heading north east very close to the horizon. One was a good distance behind the other but traveling at the same speed and appeared to be the same size. I did not hear any sound. I watched them for a good 40 seconds then left to find my camera. By the time I returned they were gone. Kinda spooky but exciting at the same time. First time I've ever seen anything like that. Wierd. ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.  PD));39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
