White, oval shaped object, disappeard suddenly. Another sighting more recently, same kind of object.;2005-03-22 16:00:00;a few seconds;White, oval shaped object, disappeard suddenly. Another sighting more recently, same kind of object. I was outside feeding my animals when I notice they're all looking at something. So I look up and I see a totally weird object. It's this white oval shaped object hovering in the sky. It was not a cloud, as it was moving too rapidly to be a cloud, and it was not a plane. I am certain of this. It was not a balloon or anything like that. I don't think it was from around here. Anyway, I look up to see it heading towards a range of mountains we call The Pinnacles. I watched it for a few seconds and all of a sudden, it was gone! I was astonished. No flash of light. No sound. Nothing. It was just gone. And the weird thing is, it was just this spooky object that made no sound. I got the chills, and I'm not sure if it was because I was really scared or if it was because I was pumped that I saw this. But then I thought, 'Probably just my mind playing tricks on me.' And that was that. Until a month or so ago. I went outside on the porch and I see that same white oval shaped object in the sky. It made no sound or anything, and it certainly didn't look like a plane. But the weird thing was, it was kind of near The Pinnacles where I saw the first white oval object. I rushed inside to grab the binoculars to see whether or not I could discern what the object was, and I couldn't find them so I rushed back outside. It was gone. I had only been inside for a few seconds, so I was puzzled. There were no traces of it whatsoever. It was totally weird. Then I look up to see another object, but it wasn't otherworldly or anything. Just a plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
White spherical object over Reno Nevada at 18:00 starting just above tree level, over airport then over mountains.;2007-05-12 18:00:00;3 min;White spherical object over Reno Nevada at 18:00 starting just above tree level, over airport then over mountains. From the 20th floor of the Atlantis Resort a white spherical/oval object was seen just above tree level between Moana & Gentry streets. It was moving slowly at first heading in an easterly directly and over the airport toward the mountains.  Speeding up it moved in an erratic motion much faster than an airplane.  As it approached the foot of the mountain it gained altitude very quickly and continued its ascent while moving away and continuing to move erratically until it disappeared into a tiny spot.  The entire event lasted 3 minutes.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
A shimmering dot like object seen thru binoculars at approx 45 degrees moving right-left eradically in field.;2009-05-09 10:40:00;20 min;A shimmering dot like object seen thru binoculars at approx 45 degrees moving right-left eradically in field. Unidentified Object Sighting:  Saturday, May 9, 2009, WST: 10:44:50 Reno, NV On Saturday, the above date and time), a neighbor living at ((deleted)) Court, Reno, NV, alerted me of this unusual sighting in Reno, NV.  He was sitting on this front porch stoop (facing West) and noticed a silver sparkling object   appearing  to travel  up the side of Peavine mountain.  At first he thought it was a helicopter but ruled this out due to the rapid ascent and abrupt changes in directions without regard to being on a road or paths that were visible on the side of the mountain.  He indicated he observed this object for about 30 seconds then decided to get his binoculars and camera. He then observed this object going above the top of Peavine in a westerly or north-westerly direction.  He used is Canon digital camera with the 40 power  lens  and took three pictures, only two frames captured the object which  was just a small dot in the totally blue sky background.  He was so excited that he yelled at me to come and see the object which was shimmering in the sky at some distance, I used his binoculars then got my binoculars to observe the shinny and our US Postman also observed the object. While using my binoculars and observing the object, it sped different directions and reversed course very rapidly, unlike any normal flying craft.   Finally it was no longer visible to me and the other observers. After the sighting, the neighbor downloaded the captured images approximately 400X and it was a very distinct object with the magnification used by the computer.  He will forward the original digital image without magnification and other photos indication the approximate angle of sighted object in the sky from out vantage point on San Simeon Ct.

Consumed the surrounding light like a vampire.   distant benevolence?...... none.;2013-05-04 03:00:00;:45 seconds;consumed the surrounding light like a vampire.   distant benevolence?...... none. At approx 03:00am on May 04 2013 while walking around the backside of our property (top of Wedekind rd. & McCarran blvd in Reno, Nevada), a slight (yet rather noticeable) motion within my periphery had grabbed my attention.  I turned to look up toward the south end of town. At about 20*deg above average horizon there was an object moving upward at a slight arc from the east.  The object traveled at a speed of approx 2+*deg per/second across the sky towards the west/s.west direction.  This is quite a bit faster than any satellite I would usually see at this hour. The size of the object if compared to a satellite (without assuming any equal distance in orbit, but merely by observable perspective) would be like comparing the sharpened tip of a pencil (satellite) with the eraser of a pencil (object) held at arms length.  The shape was of an oval, but lacked a solidly defined edge entirely. The object could have been dismissed entirely as a massive satellite ( perhaps the I.S.S. on re-entry?) or even a commercial airliner below 20,000ft.  Instead of completing an arc across the sky, it abruptly changed it's course ¾ the way and dropped downward, as if it just suddenly fell from the sky (in a very fast & controlled manner). The whole time this was being witnessed I had this very strange feeling that this object had become very aware that it was being watched, I felt this most intensely just before it fell towards the earth, as if offended by my staring at it.  However, the disturbing part had to be the way it was illuminated (or lack of illumination).  It was a VERY dark orange/pink color. It seemed as if it absorbed it's light from its surroundings, almost like some kind of parasitic negative image, or maybe like a black-hole. It glowed.... yet, it didn't.  It's surface was like a soft dark rubberized orange/pink haze... it glowed like it it was lit by some distant black-light tube.  But I swear it consumed the surrounding light like a vampire. This is not my first time seeing this phenomena in our town.  This solo one just confirmed the strange cluster formation that left myself and a friend shocked and questioning our existence this last year.  I don't believe there visiting has any distant benevolence...... none.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Bright Oval object moving slowly over Reno area Early December 2013;2013-12-11 16:50:00;30+ minutes;Bright Oval object moving slowly over Reno area Early December 2013 On December 12 2013 I saw a bright light very close to where Venus starts shining in the evening in the S.W part of the sky.  This was much brighter than Venus as well as much larger and slowly moving from west to east.  At one point it stopped moving for a few minutes and the continued on in the same direction.   I observed it through binoculars and then through my spotting scope.  The video that I got of it is through my spotter using my camcorder.  I am not sure if the video I am sending will show the pattern that was on the object but through my camcorder it is pretty defined.   My son and his stepfather saw it through binoculars from their back yard a couple of miles from my home.   I have never seen anything like it and was hoping someone could tell me what I have seen.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Strange balloon.;2014-05-26 15:00:00;ongoing;Strange bright orb in the sky ongoing for two days.  Rirst spotted in lake Tahoe the day prior, and then again on this date.   When looked at through a 8 inch telescope it appeared to be a strange balloon that did not resemble anything of a weather balloon.   A strange cylinder is located on the bottom of the large modular oval, so i believe it is some strange form of recherche ((sic.  research)) balloon.   If you are in the Reno area i strongly suggest you to check this out because it is strange that it has not moved for what now is 2 days.

At approximately 7:00 p.m. we observed a large oval light directly over our Hotel near Reno/Tahoe Airport.;2017-06-06 19:00:00;40 minutes;Location:	  ((address deleted))  Plumb Lane 		Reno, NV 89502   At approximately 7:00 p.m., we observed a large oval light directly over our hotel near the Reno/Tahoe airport.  The oval light appeared to move slightly and vary in brightness during our observation.    We estimate the object to have been at least 50,000’ in altitude and possibly much higher.  We estimate the size of the object to have been similar to a “tic tac” held at arm’s length.  The weather conditions were clear, although very windy.  The wind was blowing west to east at approximately 40 mph.  We were facing due south and object could be seen at an approximately 70 degree angle above our position.  It did not produce any sound. When we first noticed the object, the sun had not yet set, and the object was very large and very bright.  We initially thought it could have been helicopter or drone hovering over the nearby I-580 freeway.  However, this explanation was disproved when an airliner, flying at cruise altitude with the corresponding contrail, flew underneath the object.  We continued to observe the object for approximately 40-60 minutes.   As the sun set the light appeared to increase in altitude, dimming while doing so, and moving towards the east opposite the normal rotation of the earth and the rising moon/ stars.  By the time the sun had completely set the light appeared to be a normal star in size and brightness.  However, when I used the SkyView app on my phone the object did not correspond to any star, constellation, or satellite in the app’s database. I did manage to take one photograph of the light using my cell phone after numerous attempts.  However, the photo is not as detailed as our view while looking at the object.  We have no idea what it was.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
