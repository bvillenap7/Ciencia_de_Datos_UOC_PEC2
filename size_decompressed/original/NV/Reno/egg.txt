I was driving so I couldn't get a great look but it looked to be about the size of a large S.U.V..   I was unable to stop to take pictures or get a better look because I was on my way to an important meeting.   When driving back about 2 hours later the object was no longer there.  After reading there were other siting in Reno on the same day I decided to share.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
