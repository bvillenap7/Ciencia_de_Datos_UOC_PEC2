Daytime sighting over Reno airport of formation consisting of three aqua spheres and two bronze elliptoids;1993-09-15 16:00:00;45 seconds;Daytime sighting over Reno airport of formation consisting of three aqua spheres and two bronze elliptoids Looking SE I observed three fuzzy-edged aqua colored spheres arrayed in a triangle 1000ft above the valley floor* and directly above Reno-Cannon airport. As the formation ascended slowly (approx. 10 ft. per second,)the lights contracted. I then noticed a bronze, or orange elliptoid/cigar-shaped craft about 500 ft. above the triangle, rising simultaneously. This craft had a distinct outline and appeared in no way 'fuzzy.' As the formation rose the triangle contracted becoming one light without increasing in size. After a few seconds the aqua light disappeared (I believe it accelerated faster than the eye could follow,) reappearing alongside the elliptoid, and having changed shape, as it was now identical in appearance. I followed the now two bronze craft for another ten seconds until the objects vanished into the overcast at approx. 10,000ft. *Elevation: 6000ft. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

dull orange group of craft maneuvering and rotating arround each other in the sky over reno;1995-08-06 21:00:00;1 minute;dull orange group of craft maneuvering and rotating arround each other in the sky over reno I was stopped at a traffic light.  My freind was telling a story of no real interest to me.  I looked up and saw what looked to me like a plane moving above without its lights on, just visible from what I thought was the reflected lights of reno on the bottom of it. It had the same color of the bottom of a cloud that has city lights reflecting on it. There were a few points of this dull orange glow that I thought were the wings and fuselage and other parts of a plane, in that they were moving along together.  It was not bright and nothing especially wierd about it.  I had time to think  Why is that plane flying without its lights on  I think I said that interupting my friend, but as he continued his story, the individual points of dull orange split apart and seemed to orbit each other, swirling in a sort of pulsating sphere and then shoot of in all different directions.  I imediately had a wierd felling because the motion was so synchronized and so amazing I felt like it was obviously a product of some superior intelligence.  My friend thought I was joking.  The light had changed but there was no one behind me so I stopped for a minute and looked to see if maybe something was reflecting on my wind shield (with so many lights in reno) but I didn't see anything and the objects were completely gone. There was no contact of any kind with little green men so I've just kind of told this story to people that were interested in this sort of thing but I can't describe accurately to people why the movements seemed so incredible to me.  The integrated maneuvers these things pulled off in a span of a few seconds were obviousely not done by some kind of normal aircraft.  Since that time I have heard so many different accounts of these formations of objects that I figured it happens fairly often but I would like to see if anyone else had seen something arround that same period in that area ( I dont remember the exact date);39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

Wh;1998-06-06 14:18:00;2 minutes;My wife and I were on our way to Reno. I was looking at a large cloud formation that was pouring out an unbelievable amount of rain. While looking, a shiny object caught my eye. It was just at cloud level. It was V shape in formation, pointing west. It was made up of 7 silver balls. It passed in and out of the clouds, and finally dissappeared in them. My wife and I were on our way to Reno. I was looking at a large cloud formation that was pouring out an unbelievable amount of rain. While looking, a shiny object caught my eye. It was just at cloud level. It was V shape in formation, pointing west. It was made up of 7 silver balls. It passed in and out of the clouds, and finally dissappeared in them. At first I thought the formation could have been balloons because of its low elevation. However, the object never changed shape. The object was just at the bottom level of the clouds. It would pass through lower parts of the clouds, and then re-imerge. It was very windy that day. Extremely windy, however, the bject never deviated from its straight course. Sorry, I had no camera at the time, nor a camcorder. My wife and I live in Quincy, CA. About 75 miles from Reno. We were going for a few hours to shop. I work at the saw mill, and she works for Safeway. Also, my mother and father were watching KCRA news on Channel 3. The luive sky cam was overlooking Sacramento on 06/04/98 at 12:20pm. Both of the also saw balls of lights in the clouds. They saw 2 sets of 2 balls emerge from the clouds together. They also saw a formation that appeared as the Big Dipper appears in the sky. Although they do have a VCR, the sky cam shots over Sacramento are very brief, allowing them to only observe the event. Haime Maussan has video of balls of light coming out of heavy cloud cover over Mexico City, some of them observing the planes closely. What are these things doing in the clouds? Thanks.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Possibly huge craft, two red lights, flying over Reno.;2004-08-05 22:08:00;3 minutes;Possibly huge craft, two red lights, flying over Reno. Just back from walking the dog around the block for the usual 10 p.m. jaunt. I live on the eastern edge of Reno, along the Virginia mountain range. A few commercial planes in the sky, as I'm about two miles east of Reno Tahoe Intl Airport.  But coming from the northwest was a strange thing. Two reddish blinking lights seemingly connected, but at a distance that would fit maybe four commercial planes between them. No sound, either with or following the pair of lights. I *think* I could make out dim stars between the lights, but I'm not sure.  It covered the sky at a lazy speed. (One commercial jet was at about 7,000 feet moving in for the landing loop they do from the south, and the jet was moving faster. Reno is at 4,500 feet elevation.)  This was a weird one. I guess it could've been some sort of military jets flying at very high altitude in perfect time with each other, but if so I've never seen such jets before. (We've got a big Naval Air base about an hour away, and every now and then we see/hear a fighter jet over Reno.)  I watched it for the second half of the walk around our very long rural block, and stood outside my house watching as it disappeared over the Virginia range.  It appeared to be *huge.* And, to clarify the direction in case anybody else saw this thing, it went from the northwest to the southeast. (Not a satellite -- we have a pretty clear sky here and enjoy watching the space station when it comes over our part of the world, especially in the summer when my family is out on the deck.) A pair of blinking aircraft-style lights, but very erratic in the flashing. I held my hand up and the distance between the lights was about four fingers wide.  I'm very interested to hear if anybody else saw this thing. It is still fairly early and lots of people are out for the famous Reno old-car show, Hot August Nights.  My dog didn't care. He was sniffing the garbage cans & such, as tomorrow is garbage day. I'm sorry I didn't get a picture. It wouldn't have been much of a picture from our cheapo digital camera, but anyway it was headed over the mountains as I got back to the house.  I've seen one thing previously that might have been a UFO. That was about three-and-a-half years ago with my wife, driving up the 395 between L.A. and Tahoe. And that was one of those very low-flying triangle things, which we figured was some sort of test plane flying from one of the many air bases in the Mojave. But it was still exciting to see it.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Group of four points of light moving in a deliberate and manner unconventional for aircraft or satellites;2006-04-28 21:35:00;45 seconds;Group of four points of light moving in a deliberate and manner unconventional for aircraft or satellites Sighting Friday 4/28/06 @ 9:35P Location Reno, NV (39.525 Lat, 119.777 Long) Witnessed by husband and wife  Facing South-West I noticed nearly directly overhead four bright points of light of equal intensity in shape of square parallelogram spaced possibly 0.25-0.5 degrees Initial brightness 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than any other star in that part of the night's sky Color similar as other stars and constant (other than fading intensity noted below) Absolutely no other physical features were discernible Absolutely no sound observed  Points of light then changed positions several times in a smooth manner relative to each other in a pattern similar to a shell game, then deliberately aligned into a line of four abreast, then finally into four in a row before fading from vision while moving North - North-West at what appeared to be a constant speed on the order of but slightly slower than that of an orbital satellite.  During the first part of the observation the group of lights passed through a portion of the sky that was brightly illuminated vertically by the exterior lights of a nearby large hotel and resulted in causing the lights to appear to shimmer (similar to atmospheric distortion) as they crossed the cone of light.  Objects observed for a duration of approximately 45 seconds (from 90 degrees to approximately 45 degrees above the horizon)  Group intensity faded uniformly as objects moved in a Northerly direction until no longer visible  Approximately 3-4 minutes later a solo object (similar point of light but intensity 2-3 orders of magnitude lower) followed same track as first group but at a somewhat higher speed.  Object disappeared within approximately 10-15 seconds  Observer (author) has Masters degree in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering with experience in orbital vehicles and orbital mechanics and is a sworn peace officer.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Cluster of nine satellites flying together, two veering around others.;2006-10-30 19:30:00;20 minutes;Cluster of nine satellites flying together, two veering around others. While stargazing with my son using night vision goggles last night we both saw what looked like a cluster of nine Satellites flying east to west with two of the satellites weaving around the other seven. When they were almost out of view one veered directly south and they disappeard from our view. Approx. 5 minutes later we saw seven more flying in the same direction but made a big left bank heading south until out of view. After 5-6 minutes we saw five more of the same things flying in a near perfect straight line north to south until out of our view. The objects looked like satellites, no blinking light, very distant, no sound or trails but moved faster and not in the straight line across the sky.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
two light formations moving across reno, nevada;2010-11-04 21:30:00;seconds;two light formations moving across reno, nevada While driving to work I noticed, what looked like, 2 airplanes a couple of hundred feet up and pretty close together.  While driving I tried counting the lights on the crafts, in which neither formation appeared to be moving, starting with the further away craft. I believe it had 5 or 6 lights, but while counting, the craft closer to me began tilting.  Both where horizontal to the ground but this one turned completely vertical.  I was heading south and they where seen through the front windshield on the passanger side.  As it got all the way vertical, it waited for a second before turning westward. I could see hundreds of little dimmer lights along the bottom. It took off rather quickly, almost looking like a plane with no body, just wings.  I tried to see the other craft but it was miles away, then I noticed the closer craft was miles away too.  In less than a mile of driving both crafts went from close by and horizontal to the ground to tilting and moving across! town, in just seconds.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
12-15 Illuminated objects hovering and flying in formation then shooting upward and disappearing into the sky;2014-09-25 19:40:00;4-5 minutes;12-15 Illuminated objects hovering and flying in formation then shooting upward and disappearing into the sky On September 25, 2014, at approximately 1940 hours, I was outside walking my dog, when I heard a teenag boy nearby shout Oh my god, look at that! as he pointed into the sky.  He was speaking to his friend who was standing next to him and when I looked over they were both looking up in the air pointing.   From where I was standing the trees were blocking by view so I quickly ran over and as soon as I could see the sky, I was blown away, as I initially saw a formation of aircraft moving through the sky there were approximately 6-7.   I then looked further to the right and saw a second formation in the sky of 6-8 more.  They seemed to temporarily hover in the air and then continue to move sideways through the sky in formation.  They all looked just like a solid bright light and what caught everyone's attention is that they were all flying so close together, or at least closer than an normal aircraft would fly together.   Also, they appeared to be far higher in the air than I had ever seen any aircraft in my life, and that includes my time in the military and and as a civilian.  I have never seen even military aircraft moving in that type of formation.  They were extremely high in the air.  Higher than I believed normal aircraft could fly.   There were two aircraft that were not flying within the formations and were larger and brighter than the others in formations and it was amazing because they would be moving in one direction and then instantly change direction at like 45 degree angles unlike anything I had ever seen and s movement normal aircraft is not capable of doing.  It was not a turn it was an instantaneous pivot in the sky.  Those two appeared to be able to fly more freely but also seemed to be guiding the formations almost like how one man marches a formation of soldiers he is not part of the formation but he is giving the orders on how they move.  And then there was one other aircraft that was flying out of both the formations, and was also brighter and bigger than the others. At this point I ran over to my house to inform my wife to get me the number for the local press and for the local police (who referred me to your call center).  While she did that I pulled out my ipod and began recording their movements through the sky and narrating the entire experience.  As I looked up I noticed three aircraft that were not in the formations could no longer be seen. I ran back to the two guys who were still there watching.  They explained that the three big and bright aircraft had all disappeared.  They said that two of them had shot up into the air making an X and then disappeared into the sky.  They said the third one simply moved upward quickly and then disappeared as well.   I again went back over to my house and by at this time I could no longer see any of the aircraft.  Then entire incident took what looked like directly over the Reno Airport.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I did did not know whether to be amazed or scared as I am not sure what they were doing there.   At this time I do not wish to include my video recording of the event due to the sensitivity of the content.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

These craft flew in a level direct formation not changing in altitude.  My guess was approx 15K feet in elevation.  This event was from horizon to horizon.  Strangely these craft going east to southeast cut straight across the landing path of an approaching airliner heading into RNO . One lead craft and the following craft appeared to be following from the rear in the 8 oclock position.  As I mentioned they were silent. Both craft had only red slowly strobing lights.  They lights blinked in an alternating sequence.  The front craft first then the rear craft.  This pattern repeated constantly from the beginning to the end of the event.  The lights appreared to be on the tips of wings if it had wings.  Not on top just on the ends.  No green or white lights were seen. No sound of prop or jet propulsion.  The skies were dark and the weather is broken clouds..55 degrees and 41% humidity.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

I had a great view of all of downtown Reno as I was higher up and north.  The arc of lights was well above the horizon and clearly not part of any of the myriad lights downtown. There were anywhere from 2-6 starlike lights at a time, they would sometimes completely dim out to nothing, while some shone brillianty as Sirius at times.  There were always at least 2 lights, and a maximum of 6 lights total, forming half-oval arc. The lights when at their brightest shone all the colors of the spectrum, when dimmer mainly reds and yellows.  The lights always stayed in the same curious arc formation, even after dimming and totally going dark when they shined again was still in same arc formation. It appeared as though they arc was slowly moving higher in the sky. Unfortunately I was walking home after a work shift and the wife was wondering what was taking so long and cleary not interested in lights over downtown, or I would have stayed longer. Also using an older phone and camera was not up to par to capture the lights over the brilliance of downtown. I have walked many a nights through Reno and never seen anything quite like this.

Unidentified light formation spotted twice in 5 minutes, different location;2020-03-17 19:44:00;5 minutes;Unidentified light formation spotted twice in 5 minutes, different location It had been a rainy day and it was a dark, foggy night as I was driving the windy back roads through some horse property along Lakeside Avenue.  The fog was rather low and as I came around a sharp curve in the road, I saw a cluster of lights hovering perfectly still.  The all white light cluster consisted of a perfectly straight upper row of 8 lights with 2 lower lights on both right and left sides, almost like a plane, but a tighter formation.  The lights were about 200-300 feet in the air and it was clear to distinguish the distance with the low lying fog.  The object appeared to hover like a drone, but it was too large to be a drone and I dismissed it as a plane, knowing it didn’t seem correct.  I had taken a phone call just before the sighting and told my friend on the line what I was seeing, but couldn’t quite articulate what it was.  Five minutes later, I’m still on the call and now approaching a golf coarse and see the EXACT SAME formation at approximately ! the same altitude, just hovering like before.  No movement.  I travel about 1/4 mile before I turned the vehicle around in an attempt to capture a photo, but it was gone.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
