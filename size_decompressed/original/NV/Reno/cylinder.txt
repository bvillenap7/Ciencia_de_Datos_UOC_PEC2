U.F.O.s sighted from commercial airplane.;1997-06-11 11:00:00;3 Mins.;U.F.O.s sighted from commercial airplane. My wife and I were on a commercial flight from Seattle to Reno for a three day vacation.We were sitting on the starboard [right] side of the airplane with myself next to the window.We were going southbound and was about 30 minutes from landing in Reno.I was looking out and forward of the airplane when I spotted something silvery far ahead of us.As our plane continued on I noticed we were gaining on the object which was at about the same altitude that we were at, which I would estimate was about 20,000 feet.As we got closer I could see that what I thought was a single object was actually nine short cylinder shaped objects with a black band around the center of each one.They were flying in a diamond shaped, tight formation.I was in awe as I sat and watched while we passed them and then lost sight of what I am sure were some type of U.F.O's.It was'nt until the year 2000 that I found out that the area in which I saw the objects was actually close to the west end of the governments so called, highly protected, Area 51.I often wonder if they were really alien spacecraft or if they were of this earth?;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
