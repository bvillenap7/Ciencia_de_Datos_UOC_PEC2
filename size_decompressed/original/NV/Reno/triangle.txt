At 3:19 am, bright light seen outside window and then one small tugboat triangular shaped aircraft seen over the house and then both occupants taken on board craft and returned home safely 40 minutes later at 3:59 am. One of the witnesses remembers little.  Second witness able to recall clearly the entire event and is a former NYer living in Nevada, just one year and one month.  Used to live in Pine Bush UFO sightings area, so not startled by this kind of event.   Note:  I mentioned to the other witness that I could smell a strong sense of something like a chemical vapor that made me feel nauseated and then the cat came in the room and started to get sick.

Large inverted triangle light moved slowly along the flight path of the airport for about a minute then instantly vanished.;1997-07-12 02:45:00;about1:30sec;Summary : Large inverted triangle light moved slowly along the flight path of the airport for about a minute then instantly vanished. I was listening to the Art Bell show and had gone to the kitchen to get a glass of water. As I walk past the patio door I look out and saw a inverted triangle of soft golden white light. It was moving at about 60-70mph north along the flight path for Reno Cannon International Airport. At first I thought It was a planes landing lights, but I saw No blinking transponder! I stepped out side and the city was unusually quite. I listened and could hear no engine or jet noise! That is when I knew it was no plane! The flight path Is about 3 miles from my house and I can hear every plane that lands or takes off, and I have watched hundereds of planes take off and land in the 33 years I have lived here. I watched it move from just over the Reno Hilton Hotel, which is about 4-5 miles south west of my house, untill It was just over the dark line of my neighbors house due west off me when it just blinked off! At that distance I would estimate the size to be about 100 by 100 ft. The sides of the triangel were equal and the golden white light was soft enough that the glow did not distort the shape of the object. It was flying level at about a thousand ft. I own a dental laboratory and am use to paying attention to small details. It had travelled about 5 miles from the time I sppotted it untill it vanished about 90 sec. later. It travelled slow and level, it did not turn, pulsate or do any thing unusual except blink off with out even saying goodby. I thought that was very rude. They have the nerve to fly over, get people all excited then leave with out so much as even a thank you.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

We just viewed what we thought were UFOs in the bay area and wondered if there was any news about our sighting.  We heard about the 9 PM Oregon, Washington, and Reno sightings of UFOs and this sort of confirmed our sightings and wondered if they were related.  We kept hearing about triangular shaped objects being sited so we were observing the sky.  The moon was unusually bright that morning.  When I got into Reno, I was headed south on Highway 395 toward our destination and I saw three dots of light that was about 30 degrees from the horizon almost directly toward the south.  The three lights looked like stars but were unusually bright.  I have been star gazing for a couple of years since my wife and I have been interested in UFOs.  I've witnessed the landing of the Space Shuttle above the skies in Vallejo.  I also saw the Mir streak across the sky one evening when a local newscaster told me when and where to look for the Mir.  I tried to get a better view and get closer to the lights but the three lights moved toward the west and one of the lights went behind Mount Rose near Lake Tahoe.  We went climbing near Mt Rose about three weeks earlier so we were familiar with locations. The strange thing was the exact symmetry of the three points of light from each other as they slowly moved across the sky.  It seemed like they were guided exactly by the movement of the other lights.  We got out of the car and I took photos and I'm not sure if they will come out.  I should get the photos back on Tuesday.  As my wife and I looked at the two lights as they hovered behind Mt Rose, the right most light flared up in brightness and appeared like it got brighter, then suddenly dimmed.  The lights appeared to me to about 100 miles south west of Reno, somewhere above the Sierras in California.  It could be deceiving and the objects even further out like hundreds of miles.  It is hard to tell unless someone triangulates the movements as I described them.  Now my wife and I and the kids are convinced that we are not alone in this galaxy.  The numerous reports of triangle shaped objects may have merit If I am correct, the object could be miles across and may be cloaked.   The tips of the triangle are the size of stars to throw off our perception and blend in with the stars at night.  Without a telescope, it was difficult to determine if  these were craft that were navigating and controlled by equidistance between each other or one huge vessel. We were excited and contacted the local TV news stations but no one called us back.  You are our only hope to describe this UFO.  Please advise what to do next. I am a Project Manager working for ((Name deleted)) Corp and have a scientific background.  This defies all logic and we are not sure if these were astronomic bodies that we were observing.  My wife and her two sons ((Name deleted)) 12, ((Name deleted)) 9, and my sons ((Name deleted)) 3, and ((Name deleted)) 12 all observed this event and have similar observations.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

Driving  about 100 yards further I realized there was no ranger station in this area.Three very bright lights in form of a triangle started to rise slowly to altitude 150-200ft and started to move tworads my position-at this time both my vehicle and portabe radio died.The lights came directly over me slightly to my right hooverd 3-4 min then took off slowly at first seeming to move sideways then took  off at a rate of speed faster than any jet straight for the stars.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Large triangular craft with lights along the leading edge of the wing, silently traveling at a high velocity.;2000-11-07 02:15:00;one minute;Large triangular craft with lights along the leading edge of the wing, silently traveling at a high velocity. I was looking up at the constellation Orion when I saw a triangular shaped craft flying across the sky at a very high altitude.  It was moving from east to west at a very high rate of speed because it crossed from the left of the constellation Orion and disapeared off to the far right in the darkness of the horizon in the west, in approximately one minute, maybe two.  It made no sound.  It had lights along the leading edge of the triangular shaped wing.  It must have been at least a couple of miles across.  I have heard of this type of craft but I have never seen one until now.  To the rear of the craft it was dark then the stars that were behind the craft appeared distorted as if heat were rising over the road on a hot desert day.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Triangular object above freeway;2007-11-20 17:15:00;5 minutes;Triangular object above freeway I was driving South on the freeway on my way to work when suddenly traffic hit.  There were no accidents or anything.   I looked at the car next to me and noticed that the driver was leaned over his steering wheel looking straight up.  I looked up at this time and noticed a huge triangular object hovering above.  I noticed 2 helicopters circling this object, and the helicopters were tiny in comparison.   The object looked like a triangle that was lying down, but had some width to it.  It had large white lights blinking on the sides that kept going around the object in a circular motion.  It hovered for about 5 minutes and suddenly it was gone.   I didn’t see it move, take off, nothing.  It completely vanished right in front of my eyes.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
From flock of birds, to plane crash, to WTF is that!;2008-11-15 17:00:00;8-10 seconds;From flock of birds, to plane crash, to WTF is that! My rental vehicle was parked at the Grand Sierra Resort facing east and I was overlooking a small lake called MGM Lake. I was waiting for management to arrive at a new building where I was installing software. While I was in the rental vehicle listening to a college football game I noticed fish were jumping out of the lake. I live in Las Vegas and I very rarely get to see any wildlife 'in action'.  So I sat there and watched this for a few minutes when my eyes caught sight of what I thought were three birds. It was dark and I figured that lights in the distance had illuminated the birds. The birds were headed north but then banked to their right and completed a 270 degree turn. Now they were headed west, right in my direction. The area is very close to the airport and after I figured out the lights were not birds, I braced myself for a plane crash because the 270 degree turn was very fast, low, and heading lower. But once it straightened out, the lights started moving in my direction. I watched this object silently move across the sky (Had to be only 300 FT off the ground and I'd say roughly 1000 FT in front of me and I cannot judge the speed though I'd guess 200 MPH) and it went behind a tree line. I looked to the other side of the tree line expecting to see the object but nothing appeared. When I glanced up before the lights passed the tree line I could not make out any object but there were certainly three points that if you connected the dots you could make out a triangle. The rental car was idling but there was very little engine noise and I did not hear any noise from the object. There were no blinking lights and what made this even more interesting was about 20 seconds after the object went behind the tree line a plane landed. It was a small plane and I was thinking they had to have seen something!  I was in a complete sober state of mind. I called the Reno PD to see if anyone had reported the same thing and they said no.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
I saw two ufo's with three triangular white lights on fat boomerang shaped craft on i80 east west at 19:15 on 01/16/2013.;2013-01-16 19:15:00;10 minutes;I saw two ufo's with three triangular white lights on fat boomerang shaped craft on i80 east west at 19:15 on 01/16/2013. At approximately 19:10 on January 16, 2013,it was dark by then and I was driving west on i80 at Tracy Clark Power Plant when I saw a bright light as bright as the sun hovering above the power plant at first.  Then as I went about 8 more miles I realized I was getting closer and closer.  Once I reached a straight away I realized that the ufo was actually hovering right over the freeway.  Once I got closer I noticed it had three circular white lights in a triangular formation pointing east towards me.  I remember wondering if it was looking right at me.  To the northeast at the same time I saw one more set of lights same color and brightness about 10 or 15 miles  away.  Going back to the first one, I came up to it like I was looking at the mountains going 70 miles an hour.  It appeared to be fixed in one place just hovering the lights flickering as jet engines look when they’re firing.  The light was so bright that as I drove directly under it, the light reflected off! my car, and it must have been 1000 feet up or more but the light was bright enough that I could see a faint grey outline of what looked like a boomerang, fat in the middle with triangle lights and then I lost sight of it behind my windshield.  When I looked again about two miles down the road I could no longer see either craft maybe because they were too high up to see in my rear view mirror.  At 19:49 I called the national ufo hotline.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
s meadows ufo sighting.;2013-12-05 06:00:00;5 minutes;s meadows ufo sighting As I got off the highway at south meadows parkway, I saw a bright light in the sky thought it was the moon but it looked as if it was slowly turning as it got closer.  The light turned green so I went on.   As I turned onto gateway drive, a little ways up, a lighted object slowly flew over me.  It was real low and no noise so I know this wasnt an airplane, as I drove further I looked back over and the object was gone like it just disappeared.   As it was flying over me I could see small lights flashing in the back, the front of the object wasn't very lit but it appeared to be triangular shaped.   This is the first time I've witnessed this kind of thing, and I'm pretty sure that's what was out there early this morning.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

We were around the Raley's supermarket off of Keystone drive.  We saw a v shaped arrangement of lights moving relatively slowly, the same formation that geese take when in flight.   After about 30 seconds the lights became dimmer and after 10 seconds the lights were completely gone.   I tried to get my camera out but the lights had completely disappeared by then.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Stealth craft, or UFO?;2015-11-15 05:20:00;10 seconds;Stealth craft or UFO? Saw a dark triangular aircraft or ufo gliding silently, slowly, and without any lights, maybe 300-400 feet up, and the thing disappeared mid-air.   Reno has got some super stealth stuff they are testing that can SILENTLY and VERY SLOWLY traverse the skies at very low altitudes and cloak itself into invisibility, or it was a ufo.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Black triangle. Only discernible by observing the blotting out of stars. Clearly a very large object.;2015-11-15 05:20:00;15 seconds;Black triangle.  Only discernible by observing the blotting out of stars. Clearly a very large object. I can confirm previously reported sighting of triangular shaped object that was either incredibly massive at higher altitudes or around the width of a football field at lower altitudes.  It was completely silent and moved NNW from view until a single story building obscured the view. Object was completely dark, only visible by the triangular shape of the stars being blotted out as it moved beneath them.  This was not a small triangle from my vantage point.  If I held out my hand at arm's length and spread out my fingers, all three corners of the triangle would protrude very noticeably from the outline of my hand.  Triangle was perfect-edged, with no discernible features (such as those found on a stealth bomber).  Movement was slow and steady with no variability in altitude discernible.
