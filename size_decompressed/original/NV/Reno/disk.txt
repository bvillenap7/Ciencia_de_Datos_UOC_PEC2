A disk shape hovering over my apartment building in broad daylight in a busy city.;1975-05-01 17:00:00;2 minutes;A disk shape hovering over my apartment building in broad daylight in a busy city. This happened when I was 15 years old. My mother had taken me, my brother,my friend, and her roommate to get Kentucky Fried Chicken in her van. When we got back to the entrance of our apartment building (The Village of the Pines on 700 E. Peckham Ln.) my mother yelled, look at that and pulled off on the street (not entering the driveway) and we all got out and looked at this weird round thing hovering over the apartments. It seemed to me that the top 1/3 of the craft had windows and I remember trying to see if I could make out the shadows of the people(?) moving around inside. The bottom of the craft was lit up but did not seem to be bright (it was still daylight). There was a slight humming sound the whole time, then it went off over the back part of the apartment complex. It did not zip off, but seemed to be at a fairly regular plane speed. The strange thing is that the roommate and my brother immediately afterward claimed they didn't see a thing, even though I remember them wondering aloud as to what it might be. I have always personally thought that it might have been some kind of top secret aircraft of the US government. This apartment building is directly acrtoss a K-Mart, and is close to the airport. It was daylight on a busy street, and a few cars did stop, but I don't remember anyone else getting out.  I have never reported this sighting as it always seemed to weird. This incident did get me interested in the subject of UFO's but I have never seen a description like mine. This is the main reason why I think it may have been some kind of test craft.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Disk shaped craft hovering above house in Stead, Nevada;1975-11-27 16:30:00;5 min;Disk shaped craft hovering above house in Stead, Nevada My mother and I were walking down the street in Stead,a community about eight miles north of Reno Nevada,when we heard a group of kids hollering Ufo. We thought at first it was some sort of game but hovering right on top of a house was a disk shaped object.It was about eight feet long and five feet high.It made no sound at all but you had the feeling it was aware of you.This was Not man made or ball lighting.While we were watching it a man drove up. He had been following it across the desert from highway 395.The strange thing was , he was in the military and said he had seen this type of craft before outside a base in Colorado but only at night.Stead is a decommissiond Air Force base.After a few minutes it slowly rose up,again without a sound reached a height of a hundred feet or so then it was gone.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

At about 12:45pm on July 21st this year, two close friends and I were on my back patio smoking when one of my friends spotted something;2004-07-21 12:45:00;20 minutes;At about 12:45pm on July 21st this year, two close friends and I were on my back patio smoking when one of my friends spotted something unusual in the sky. Both friends spotted it before me, as it took my eyes a minute to adjust to the clear bright sky. We were looking west in the direction of W.hwy 80. The object hovered and intermittingly moved as though it was going in and out of visibility. Every time it would do a sharp fast maneuver the sun would reflect silver. The object appeared to be at least 20000 ft high at first, hovering, then disappearing and appearing 1000's of feet lower, sometimes higher. Then it would do a 180 degree (half circle) maneuver and disappear only to reappear higher again. It was moving from west to N.east and eventually went straight over my apartment. The object was the typical silver saucer type. When it moved from south to north in a straight line it had some kind of tail behind it, hard to describe. It glowed amber/white. We watched this craft for 30 minutes. I watched my watch carefully as time seemed to stand still. I have never in my life watched a UFO for this long! 5-10 minutes at the most with a few past sightings but this was unreal. I remember the times specifically because I had a doctor’s appointment at 1:30pm that afternoon which I ended up being late to by 5 minutes and the doctor’s office is right across the street from my apartment not 2 minutes away. My two friends watched it for 5-10 minutes after I left for my doctors appointment as they say it came directly over the apartments at what they said was about 4000 feet. It then turned reddish amber and then just disappeared. The movements and maneuvering were simply mind blowing. No sound whatsoever.  The strangest part of this sighting was that after watching the craft for about 10 minutes I heard a jet high above. It must have been at least 30000 feet up and it was all white with a radar type thing on top. Military for sure. It came from east, (possibly the Fallon, NV airbase?) and turned left and was heading south straight for the craft. The craft seemed to toy with the jet, appearing above then below flying in front then behind. Then the craft just hovered and seemed to start ignoring the jet as the jet flew from north to south maybe 20-30 miles and then banked east and just flew till we couldn’t see it anymore. The strangest part was that as the craft hovered and maneuvered around the jet, the jet turned on some kind of ultra bright light of some kind that came from the center area of the plane and flashed a steady bright light that resembled a huge camera flash but it stayed on for at least 45 seconds then went off. All I know is the gov knew it was up there and must have been checking it out. The craft as it toyed with the jet, it seemed to show off to us. I think what seemed like a 30 minute sighting may have involved missing time. All I know is my watch said 30 minutes had passed from the time we first started watching the craft, until I left for my appointment.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Disk-shaped object sighted with rotating lights, only a few hundred feet away.;2009-08-08 22:00:00;45 minutes;Disk-shaped object sighted with rotating lights, only a few hundred feet away. On the drive home with my boyfriend, I spotted a light in the sky that caught my attention.  It was a disk-like shape with many yellow-white lights moving in a circular motion around the craft.  The object also had one small red light near the top center of the craft.  I pointed the object out to my boyfriend and within about a minute, the object had moved all the way across the valley of Reno, NV, and could barely be seen anymore. We noticed that a helicopter came relatively close to the object several times, but the object seemed unaffected by its presence. We decided to attempt to follow the craft to investigate further.  As we drove across the city, the craft moved closer and farther away, sometimes hovering in one spot for several moments.  At one point, we got near enough to the craft that we could see with the unaided eye its true shape.  It was still disk shaped, but it had become apparent to us that there were two rows of lights instead of one, spin! ning around the craft in a circular motion.  At our closest, the object was a few hundred feet in the air away from us.  At this point, the object turned onto its side, much like a Frisbee rolling on the ground, then turned back to its flat side, and began again to move away from where we parked. We continued to drive throughout the city to get closer, but the object eventually disappeared from sight altogether.  In the dark it was very difficult to see the full shape of the object, but I and my boyfriend are certain that this was no helicopter, plane, or child's toy.  We attempted to both photograph and videotape the object, but neither method was successful in picking up the image.  To clarify, neither of us have ever seen anything like this.  We are both young college students with no history of mental illness.  We have seen TV shows regarding these kinds of incidents, and have always found them to be exaggerated and quite unrealistic.  After today, we are unsure what to believe and are searching for some sort of logical explanation.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Reno area fast traveling object;2011-08-17 22:30:00;30 sec or less;Reno area fast traveling object I am a typical sky watcher in the evenings when I go out to smoke.  My field of view is mostly overhead to east south east, and south, with tree blockage to the west of me.  Most of the city light is blocked out in my back yard, but with typical diffuse light to the eye. I think I am pretty good at identifying that, which is an airplane in the air, or other having grown up around aviators, and people in the space industry. What I saw tonight was moving not as fast as say a meteorite would, like a streak, nor was it the slow steady pace of an airliner over head.   I am pretty familiar with the flight patterns and speeds of various craft overhead, helicopters or what have you, and with Reno airport nearby, it is easy to tell airplanes around. This “ufo” was orange in color, very high in the sky.  There were lower lying clouds tonight overhead, so I could tell it was above that cover.  It was moving from west to easterly direction, and man, this was not any airplane I have ever seen.   Very fast moving, but with purpose.  It was saucer to egg, to oval shaped, leaving no trail behind it.  There was no noise, though from my location sometimes you can hear very high up aircraft in later evenings. This was pretty weird to me, enough to want to report it, but was also wondering if anyone else in the Reno area saw something they questioned tonight.  Were there any low flying satellites tonight in that trajectory and time, that is possible what I saw?   I honestly don’t think it was THAT high, not space high definitely in airspace air. Thanks.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Blue ring with red blinking dots inside caught on video moving in the sky in irregular patterns.;2014-12-27 21:00:00;3 minutes;Blue ring with red blinking dots inside caught on video moving in the sky in irregular patterns. Walking home from work when I saw blue and red blinking lights much like a plane.  It wasn't until it shot across the sky that I took more notice of what it was.   A circle of blue lights with 3 red lights in a triangle formation in the center that blinked at differing intervals.  I'm not sure of the shape because it had definite mass blocking out the stars that did not have lights on it.   It changed direction multiple times at varying speeds before stopping and hovering for a few seconds.   All the lights started pulsing before it moved away out of sight at a faster speed than any plane I've ever seen in the sky.   I caught the majority of the event on video.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

It had a yellow light on each side and had 2 flashing red lights on the bottom.   It was in the sky when I started my run and I didn't think anything of it.  I finished my run about 20 min later and it was in the same spot.   I ran inside to grab a pair of binoculars and when I came back out about 15 seconds later it was gone.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
