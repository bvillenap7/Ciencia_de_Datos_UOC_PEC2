Possible anti gravity propulsion system.;1994-07-15 03:00:00;30 minutes;Possible anti gravity propulsion system. First Reporting date: 9/24/1998 Reported to: Art Bell on Coast to Coast Show by fax. I would like to take this opportunity to report a possible Unidentified Flying Object [UFO]and share some insight into the greenish and while lights that are being seen in the sky. Five years ago, in 1993, I had a very close encounter or you could refer to it as a standoff with an Unidentified Flying Object [UFO] in the Reno, Nevada, area.  Excuse my pun, but I may be able to shed some light on the subject of UFO’s.  I cannot tell you exactly what it was, but I can tell you that it was not a fixed wing or helicopter that was currently known to the general public and there for unidentified. My military background includes an active duty tour in the U.S Air Force as an Aircraft Maintenance Specialist on F-111’s and other tactical fighter aircraft and over 20 years as a Security Forces Specialist and Supervisor.  I have extensive experience in Search and Rescue Air Support with both fixed wing and military helicopters. In this particular incident, I was working as a Sheriff’s Deputy on swing shift and had worked overtime until around 0300 hrs. in the morning.  I changed into my street clothing and put my Glock 9mm in my pancake style holster on my pants belt and put another magazine into my rear pocket.  I got into my Chevy 4x4 pickup truck and headed Northbound on highway 395 and to my residence in the Cold Springs Valley area near the Nevada/California boarder. At about 0330 hours, I crested a hill on Hwy. 395 at started to drop down in elevation towards the Cold Springs Valley.  I observed a bright white circular light moving back and forth across the base of Pevine Mountain near the Southbound lanes of Highway 395, which is several miles from the old Crystal Peak Mine access road. The area is about 5400 feet in elevation and the white light looked to be about 150 feet, above ground level or AGL.  At first, I thought that it might have been a Nevada Army National Guard OH-58 helicopter with a search light mounted on it, although I did not remember one on any of the aircraft I had flew on during search and rescue.  I did not see any formation lights, not strobes or anti-collision lights. At the bottom of the hill, I took the exit and pulled up to the stop sign. I sat there for a couple of minutes.  I shut my engine and lights off to listen to the sound of the main roto blades and did not hear anything.  The intensity of the bright light did not change as the object moved in a circular pattern and a nose mounted searchlight or a side mounted searchlight would have varied in intensity as the nose of the helicopter turned. I watched the bright light for about 3-4 minutes, before restarting my truck and turning on to Cold Springs Drive to drive around the dry lake bed.  While driving around the lake bed, I thought that another vehicle was catching up to me, as I would see some light and then it was gone.  After driving around the lake bed, I turned onto Brant Street and drove about 2 and half miles to my residence. As I pulled into my driveway and got out of my truck, I noticed that the very bright light was traveling along Brant Street at about 150 feet above the roadway towards my position. I moved out into the middle of the culdesac where it was dark and just stood there to try to get a glimpse of what type aircraft it was.  The nearest street light was about half a block away, so I felt a little safe in the dark.  My first thought was, Great, the object followed me home. The object was moving about 15-20 miles per hour and maintaining about 150-200 feet AGL.  I attempted to observe the outline of the object, but the brightness of the white light prevented it, and the intensity was much brighter that a searchlight that can be mounted on helicopters.  The light seemed to form a round disk type area about 100 ft. in diameter and was the only outline to judge the size of the object.  The object stopped moving towards me and remained stationary in the air with no main rotor blade or tail rotor noise. I was able to observe that there was a greenish hue to the white light emitting from the bottom of the object and said in a loud voice, “Oh, so that light is actually a low attitude propulsion system”.  I was surprised when the object moved sideways about 15 feet, as if answering the question. I got the feeling that I was being observed by a FLIR system- Forward Looking Infrared Radar.  I decided to wait this situation out, as I did not want to identify my house with a sleeping family. I was having a standoff with an UFO and I was thinking to myself, I bet they never abducted a cop with a Glock before and reached down and padded my Glock on my hip. I was hoping that the object would cross over me or move past me slowly, so I could get a look at the underside of the object.  The object maintained a silent hover for about 15 minutes as I stood still.  After about another five minutes, I decided to press the issue and threw up my hands and said very loudly, ”Well, what are you going do, do something”. The white light underneath the object became a greenish/ white color, with what looked like greenish water droplets as big as silver dollars spitting out the bottom for about 10 to 15 feet.  Then the greenish, white light shot straight up into the sky and was gone in about three seconds. I hung around for about another five minutes expecting the object to return since we were so close, but the object did not return and I searched the sky and did not see anything except the stars. I had feeling at the time that the object that followed me home may have been a either a Black Project from the Southern Desert area, or just a UFO. I did not mention the incident to anyone at the time as it would not have been politically incorrect to do so and could have been detrimental to my law enforcement carrier.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
We were driving down the road late at night when we saw a neon green light shoot across the sky and then it stopped on a dime. It hover;1998-04-22 23:25:00;2 min.;We were driving down the road late at night when we saw a neon green light shoot across the sky and then it stopped on a dime.  It hovered for about 30 seconds then shot off again.  It did that several times across the sky then seemed to disapear in to the mountains We were driving down the highway at about 60 miles per hour when we saw a green ball of light.  It was a round shape and it held it's shape the whole time.  It was very quick to move through the sky then it stopped on a dime.  It hovered as it seemed to look like it was going to fall but it didn't.  Instead it shot across the sky again.  It looked like it was observing people on the highway. It hovered over the highway for about 30 seconds then left the sky. We looked again and again for it but it did not come back to show its face. During the time that it hovered our car had went crazy.  The windshield wipers went of and the radio went dead.  The lights started to flash and it was very eerie.  When it left the car went back to normal and we did not see the craft again.  There is a airport nearby about 3 miles away but there were no planes going that late at night.  It's a private airfield and there were no planes taking off that late at night. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness intended a time of 23:25 hrs., and we have amended the time above.

An object with lights blinking in succession moving very slowly over Reno Nevada Saturday night, January 27, 2001.;2001-01-27 19:40:00;3 minutes;An object with lights blinking in succession moving very slowly over Reno Nevada Saturday night, January 27, 2001. My son and I were driving and we saw an object in the sky that was moving very slow.  It didn't look like an airplane because of the way the lights were.  They were blinking on and off from the right and from the left side.  The lights were coming on in succession from the right side and the left side.  It seemed to have 2 sets of lights, one on the left and one on the right.  There appeared to be about 5 lights on each side.   I think at the same time.  The lights were a white color, nothing unusual.  There were trees in the way and we were trying to find a place to pull over so we could just watch this thing, by the time we went up and over the hill (lost sight of it behind the trees), it was gone.  We pulled over anyway and watched for a few minutes and it was no where to be seen.   There was only one of them.  We were wondering if anyone else saw the same thing. Thank you.

We would be grateful if anyone could confirm whether there may have been a blimp in residence at Reno on this date.  PD));39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

I was on my way home from work.  I was coming up over a small pass about 12 miles North of Reno on Hwy 395, just before the Cold Spring;2002-09-11 20:45:00;LESS THEN A MINUTE;I was on my way home from work.  I was coming up over a small pass about 12 miles North of Reno on Hwy 395, just before the Cold Springs exit when I saw a very large bright red light very low in the sky.  It was flashing and moving very fast.  I was so focused on the light I did not see anything else.  At first I thought a helicopter was landing on the freeway, then I thought no way, as the light was huge, moving to fast and there was absolutely no sound.  The lights flashed across the freeway and up the side of Peavine mountain and disappeared.  It happened so fast I did not see anything but the light.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
A color-changing, spark-like migrating light in the western sky -- seen in Reno, NV ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius.  PD));2005-02-27 00:00:00;1 hour + 25 min;A color-changing, spark-like migrating light in the western sky -- seen in Reno, NV At midnight, I was standing outside facing west and noticed a bright light that seemed to be a star.  I watched for several seconds, as the brightness intrigued me.  It seemed that the star was changing colors: red, blue and white.  I went and got my binoculars.  Looking with binoculars, it appeared as a bright light, changing colors routinely from red, blue, white and occasionally all white, and then back to red, blue and white.  My husband came out to view it at my request at this point.  He noticed that it also appeared to be changing shape and size.  When it changed size to smaller, the lights tended to converge.  The object at first appeared to remain stationary in the sky (while still changing size).  I stood in one spot on my deck and made note of the surrounding background (i.e., a neighbor's pin-oak tree, where I noted the object in relation to the branches, and to determine whether it was moving.)  My husband and I continued to view this from 12 am to after 1:15 am.  After the first 15 minutes of viewing, it gradually migrated further to the right, so that after 1 am, it was far to the right of this pin-oak that I had used to measure this star and give relevance to its location.  It started to become more red and orange in color, and around 1:25 it was gone, seeming to have migrated beyond the mountain range to the west of Reno.  We made note of the other stars and the moon in the sky.  During the entire time of seeing this light, the position of the stars and moon had changed slightly, but the light was moving more gradually than the stars and moon, by far.

Reno, NV  Green Spherical Luminous Object over Reno;2006-10-21 18:54:00;6 seconds;Reno, NV  Green Spherical Luminous Object over Reno ((address deleted)) Blvd.  Had just entered 395 highway going south.  At the same time I began to notice an object entering my field of view from the left, my friend pointed towards it and said What is that?.  I saw a distinct green circular shape moving at an extremely high speed from the Northeast to a Southwest direction.  It appeared the object was descending, but this could have been an illusion.  It appeared it was low, approx. 500-1000 ft.  (If I held a ruler up in front of my eyes the object would have measured about 1/4 in diameter). There was no sound, like a military jet travelling at high speed might make.  I could not be sure if what I was seeing was propulsion from a craft or not.  It was dark and I could not see any shape other than the large green circle. I would estimate it traveled at least 4 miles in about 3 seconds as I had a view of the whole Reno valley.  It was moving much more rapidly than I would expect an civilian or government aircraft (planes or helicopters) to be traveling at.  After about six seconds, with the object heading toward the Sierra Mountain range, it suddenly and abruptly disappeared, like it simply just blipped out.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
UFO flutters, makes right angle turn and accelerates to impossible speed.;2007-09-08 04:30:00;15 Minutes;UFO flutters, makes right angle turn and accelerates to impossible speed. While waiting for the Reno Balloon Races to commence, I spent my time watching for satellites. After spotting a couple of normal ones, I saw a very unusual one. This one’s flight characteristic seemed to be like a butterfly in a strong breeze except very, very high up (high up enough to reflect sunlight at about 4:15am).  It appeared to be climbing in altitude quickly also. It was headed in a southerly direction and headed into Orion. As it climbed, it seemed to slow and then just lazily move towards the westerly foot (star name = Rigel) of Orion. I pointed this out to a passing stranger who showed no particular interest. As it reached Rigel, it slowed to a stop and reversed course. It was as faint as a smaller satellite at this point, and proceeded slowly in a northern direction past Meissa (Orion’s head), past Mars and to Triangulum. At approximately the star Perseus, the object made an abrupt 90 degree turn to the east and started to slowly accelerate at first. A couple of women with their 2 children came to sit next to me and I pointed this out to them, they focused in quickly, and the object accelerated  to the point that it went from almost straight above us to the horizon in about 2 seconds while the apparent size grew from a small, dim star to a large size star. I have watched the stars since I was a child, and have studied astronomy for decades. The flight characteristics of this object matched no known aircraft that I have ever heard of as far as fluttering, ability to make an instantaneous 90 degree turn at high velocity, or speed. To go from straight above to beyond the horizon at that altitude constitutes speeds that NASA could not duplicate in their wildest dreams.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
A turquoise light appeared and then there seemed to be a creature appearing from the spacecraft;2008-12-22 06:50:00;less than 5 seconds;A turquoise light appeared and then there seemed to be a creature appearing from the spacecraft   In the morning at, a little earlier than seven AM, two of my buddies, and I were coming back from Elko, Nevada and traveling westward on highway eighty. We were traveling to Sacramento, California to then fly back to Raleigh, North Carolina.  The purpose of our travel to Elko was to see our long lost friend from elementary school. When traveling back we took a stop in Reno, Nevada.  From there we spent the night at a motel, Motel 8, and then, in the morning, upon departure, we saw, what we thought to be, a UFO. There was a bright light, it then turned into a turquoise color and seemed to disappear.  We then heard heavy winds, from inside the car, and then we saw lots of dust and a dim light. I believe we saw some kind of creature approaching us.   My friends and I, were shocked when we saw it and panicked on whether we should go back to Elko or continue into California.  We continued our trip until we arrived in Sacramento, which is where we “stole” Internet, from the hotel we were outside of, to search up about UFO’s.   We then found this website’s number and called it, when we were off of the plane and traveling back to where we reside.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Faint object  seen shooting over Cold Springs Valley in Reno, Nevada;2009-12-26 06:15:00;2 seconds;Faint object  seen shooting over Cold Springs Valley in Reno, Nevada Time is approximate on this, sorry!  I and one of my brothers were visiting our brother in Reno, Nevada over Christmas.  His house is in the Cold Springs Valley area!  I stepped outside his garage to have a cigarette, on the side of his home.  It was still dark outside, but with a faint glow of the sun just barely starting to lighten the sky.  Not knowing exactly which direction his house faces, I will only suggest that I was on the east side of it at this time!  Being a believer of this type of thing, I always watch the skies in the hope that I will see something, and this time I did!  I was looking upwards, and I had high thin clouds to my right, but the skies were mostly clear.  I looked to my left more, and caught a fain object shoot past my field of vision at a very high rate of speed!  And I mean fast!  As I said, maybe only 2 seconds of viewing time!  What ever it was, it was not at an altitude to be lit by any sunlight because there was only a hint of lightening of the sky at this early hour!  And I saw it for such a short time span, than I can't even tell you what shape it was, either!  It was there, and then gone!  It's size I would approximate as being about the size of a pencil eraser, held about 8-10 feet away, looking straight on.  I went inside and told my brothers about this and one suggested that it might have been a bird!  But this was way too fast to be a bird!  And the other, which I tend to partially agree with suggested that it might have been a meteor!  The one problem I have with this is that I don't know a great deal about celestial bodies, but this seemed an awful lot closer to the ground than a meteor!  I would say no farther than 7-9,000ft above me!  I tried to follow it's path, to see if it would reflect any light from somewhere, but, nothing! It was pretty faint, and was gone really too quickly!;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Unusual object over Reno/Stead NV;2012-05-10 15:00:00;1 Minute;Unusual object over Reno/Stead NV I live in Stead, NV, just north of Reno.  Yesterday,  I stepped out to get my mail and a glint in the sky (like a small glint of metal) caught my eye.  I looked at it and saw an unusual object moving from right to left, very high in altitude and moving unusually slowly.  All I can say is that it was long, very large and if I had to make a comparison, would say it was cylindrical in shape, but can't be sure of that due to its distance.   There was another plane at high altitude in the sky with it some distance to the southwest (not in pursuit, probably a commercial aircraft) and it was clearly leaving a contrail but whatever this was, was not.   I leaned down to get my mail out of the mailbox, which took all of 3 seconds, looked back up fully expecting it to be there and it had completely vanished.  I'm a little frustrated at myself for taking my eyes off of it, I would have liked to have seen how it just apparently blinked out.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
2 women are frightened by a very loud low flying object, while in their hotel room, watching a lightening storm.;2015-08-02 01:30:00;1 minute;2 women are frightened by a very loud low flying object, while in their hotel room, watching a lightening storm. 8-2-15:  Two women ((initials deleted/40's/female #1)  and ((initials deleted/50's/female #2)) were sitting in their hotel room ((room # deleted)) at the Marriott Residence Inn on Gateway Drive in Reno, NV.  We were watching a large lightning show that had gone on for over 1 hour.  It was very intense, but though there was enormous amounts of lightning we heard no thunder. At about 1:30 am, our 1st floor room began to shake…we both thought earthquake!  Then we heard a very loud noise like a giant vacuum going very slowly overhead!  We could feel a large amount of energy that made all ((deleted--2nd woman's)) hair stand on end and cause ((deleted--1st woman)) to be nauseous. We looked at each other with wide eyes, and both said simultaneously, “What the hell is that?”  Then a very bright white light appeared outside the window.  The light seemed very low…barely clearing the top of the 2 story hotel.  It was angled down toward the ground.  We thought it was finished going over, but then a second round of the very loud bass sound began crossing the ceiling.  We determined that there were either 2 objects or on very large object with 2 engines.  There was no light accompanying the second sound. Things that were hanging in the room were swaying. ((female #2)) ran outside to see what it was but because of the trees and height of the surrounding hotels was unable to see anything but the light moving very slowly.  She heard what she could only describe as loud mechanical wailing. We waiting to see if we would hear anything else….like the freeway or maybe airplanes.  We did hear those things but it was NOTHING like the fly by experience.  We were freaked out by it. ((female #2)) began frantically texting her husband, who told her to call 911 if anything else happened.  No other strange happenings occurred, so she did not call. The sound was like nothing either had ever experienced before.  ((femal #2)) grew up next to an international airport and is very familiar with the sounds of helicopters, and even fighter jets.  This was neither of those things.  Both women were convinced that it was an aircraft unlike any they knew of. They were shocked.  ((female #1's))((deleted--teen relative) slept through the whole experience. We could find no reason why a helicopter or plane would fly that slow and low over hotels.  We considered that there is an Emergency Room at the Renown Hospital nearby, but this craft did not fit any of our understanding of a typical helicopter.  It was moving extremely slow, and had a constant bass humming sound...no chopper sound at all. There were dogs in this hotel and they were all barking. ((female #2's)) ears were ringing very loudly from the intense sound.  This lasted until she fell asleep several hours later. Neither of these two women have ever experienced anything like this before and both were trying hard to figure out what it could be...in the end, both agree it was either a secret military craft or a UFO;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

I pulled into Taco Bell and I noticed these 3 red lights drifting in the air.  They were in alignment one on top of the other and were slowly moving south and up.  They looked mysterious to me.  After I left the drive thru at Taco Bell I noticed a car with two men outside of it and they were looking in the sky.  I said to them, “Oh, you saw those too?”  One guy said, “ya, there was three of them, but they left, this is the last one.”  I drove up a bit so I could get out of the lights because I wanted to take a video.  I took a video and then watched it for a while and left.  It gradually faded and kept going up and to the left. Thank you, I am a Coast listener and I will send you the video if you’d like.

Large flashes of light, followed by distant explosion noise going on for almost an hour.;2017-07-24 01:35:00;~40 minutes;Large flashes of light, followed by distant explosion noise going on for almost an hour. At around 1:35 in the morning, flashes of bright light started appearing outside in intervals.  They would occur around every 5-7 minutes, and would fill up my whole room, along with all of outside.   Around 20 seconds after the lights appeared a loud but distant explosion-type noise could be heard.  This went on until around 2:10 AM.   The lights have not occurred since and I was only able to fully witness the last two.  It could not have been a lightning storm, because it has been clear all day, and fireworks would not have been bright enough.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Undefined shaped object with vertical bars of white/red/green flashing lights traveling silently across Pyramid lake from south to west;2017-10-18 05:10:00;3 minutes;Undefined shaped object with vertical bars of white/red/green flashing lights traveling silently across Pyramid lake from south to west Wed. October 18th 5:10 AM Pyramid Lake, Reno, Nevada  While walking the dog, I saw a flash of light out of the corner of my eye and assumed it was a shooting star.  I expected to see it burn up upon entry into atmosphere.  Instead there were two bright vertical lights in the distance over the lake.  They appeared to hang there for several minutes.  As the lights approached I could see there were actually three large landing type lights in a vertical row.  As the ‘thing’ turned I could now see several red flashing lights and a couple of green pulsing lights behind them.  What was odd was that they were all vertical and nothing horizontal.  There was not a sound coming from that direction.  As a commercial airline  pilot for 36 years I could not imagine what kind of aircraft could have this light formation and move so quietly.  It traveled horizontally across the lake from south to northwest over the Sierras at a fairly rapid rate.  As it was totally dark out, I could not discern any shape behind the lights.  The distance and altitude would be hard to tell although I could see a glow on the lake from the lights, like you can when the moon is bright and shining on water.  I could also see a faint shape of distant mountains behind and above the object.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
