White snake -like plume with objects on either end;2004-10-14 14:20:00;2 hours;White snake -like plume with objects on either end This happened on a beautiful windless and cloudless clear day around 2:20 pm. I work at Meadowood Mall and went out to my car in the west parking lot. When I got into my car and looked west, I noticed a thick, white irregular rope-like plume in the sky. It was low in the sky and I thought it might be a stunt plane spewing out a trail. It was moving west to east about a half mile away maybe, and to the north of my position. It move slowly. As it approached closer going towards the Reno airport it was obviously not the smoke coming out of a plane, but two strange objects connected by this snake-like white plume. The substance was not whispy like smoke, but thick and shiny white. This object is a little hard to describe. The best I can explain the the rope-like substance is if a can of shaving cream was shot into a basin of water and then froze. The object became more vertical, with an ovoid object on top that appeared to be moving a little back and forth as if creating the plume, with the plume in the middle and an orb-like object on the bottom. One of the dock people was dumping garbage in a big dumpster in the parking lot and I got out of my car and brought his attention to it. We both watched and commented on the sheer strangeness of the thing. The object was passing north of us now, and a couple of customers in the parking lot were noticing it too. As the thing headed east, the plume began to tighten up, and become more straight. I decided to get a couple of employees to come out after watching it for about 10 minutes. When they came outside, the object had attained a higher altitude and was sitting south of the airport close to Rattlesnake Mountain. As we all continued to watch it, an older woman stopped her car by us and asked what is that thing? We said it looked like a ufo. She smiled and drove on. By this time I was MIA at the store, so I had to go back inside. I took every opportunity to go back outside  and observe the object, which had now turned into a white orb. At 3:30 pm I took my hour lunch, and watched the object for an hour with a friend of mine who popped into work to see me. It moved west of its position south of the airport and closer to us. It appeared to change shape sometimes from an orb to a rod, then back into an orb in a blink of an eye. We saw four or five planes fly near or over the object. They appeared to be taking an interest in the object. At 4:25 or so I had to go back inside. A couple of young guys had stopped thier truck near us and asked what it was we were looking at. As I walked back to the store they were still looking at it. The next day more people at work said they had seen the strange thing also. It is now 12/11/04 and once again I went to my car around 3:15 pm to take a break and saw another white orb-like object to the north east moving south west towards my position. It moved in a slightly zig-zag way, and sometimes appeared to have a small tail. It looked like it was swimming through the air. It stopped and headed north east then, getting smaller and smaller until it was out of sight. It was a warm still day with few clouds and good visibility. Well, it is after this sighting that I decided to put my two cents in. To be fair, I have had several sightings of these things in Sparks where I live. My unit is almost directly above the flght paths of the commercial airlines. These sightings always happen on clear still days. What they are is anyone's guess, but they seem intelligent and alive When people ask me why I have had sightings and they have not, my advise is look up!;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

They had a bright orange diamond like shape. As they moved up in the distance they changed into more of a white sphere. At one point they all appeared to be one object then they split apart, appearing like they were dancing or playing in the sky, with a pendulum motion. They appeared to be about 2 or 3 miles away and the size of a dime held at arm's length. The higher they went the smaller they appeared, their lights became dimmer and then no longer were visible. They gave the appearance like they just vanished.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

Then we noticed this thing was roughly 8,000 feet up and about 5 to 6 miles away. It kept changing shapes until settling on a ball of light. It moved from a south position, to a south-east position and back again several times, at which point another object, much fainter than the first appeared, moved from a southern position in relation to the original object, then began to circle it in a clockwise fashion. We were all at a local cafe, and several people went outside to see what the fuss was about. I had stopped a River Patrol Bicycle police officer to visually confirm what we were seeing. After several minutes the two objects shot straight up and out of view. We then noticed fighter jets circling the sky where the object(s) had been. I have taken a photo of it with my cell phone camera and so did my friends girl friend. I also took a photo of the fighter jets.  I went to several websites, and it did not exemplify the behavior of the naked eye GRB that took place that day, nor did it seem like a star in keeping with the rotation of the Earth as it would only move in one direction if this were the case. I also went to see if it was a satellite, no luck there. I'm at a loss to explain this in conventional terms. These objects were witnessed by several people in the downtown Reno area. And one person in the Northtowne area of Sparks, Nevada.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Craft changing color and direction over Reno,NV.;2012-01-02 18:30:00;40 mins;Craft changing color and direction over Reno,NV. My wife and I were on our way back into Reno driving on I-80 West bound at about 630pm.  My wife looked up and saw a strange light in the sky and said it looked to close to be a star and it was not a plane because it didn’t not have any flashing lights on the bottom.  About the same time I looked up it changed color from white to red and seemed to change direction because the shape went from Round to Oblong.  After watching it change color and shape for about five minutes we noticed a low flying plane coming quick from the opposite side of the craft.  As the plane got closer to the craft it was as if someone turned a light switch off because the light from the craft was gone except for a real strange glow emitting from the craft. My wife and I thought it just disappeared and thought the strange sighting was over.  As the plane descended and disappeared over Reno the light came back as if a switch was hit again and was closer and brighter than before.  My wife and I continued to watch from the road for a total of about 40 mins and we could see the light pulsing and move from one spot to another with speed faster than any aircraft we have ever seen. This craft seemed to descend and ascend repeatedly and go from North to South. As we watched the craft it seemed to change color many times and continued into the sky north until it was completely out of sight.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Odd shaped object;2015-10-18 15:05:00;2 minutes;Odd shaped object Saw a UFO (time approx. 3:05pm).  Object spotted, saw through study window screen, caught my eye ascending.. guessing about 3-5 ft. across? (possibly 2 objects flying very closely together as it seemed to change shape).  No lights, dark/black in color, about 500? ft away.  Undulating up/down, erratic, moving at a steady rate first ascending then moving horizontally to the left.  Not a plane, bird and it's odd movement ruled out balloons.  Walked out onto my front porch to watch.  Flew behind next door neighbors pine tree.   Went into backyard to reacquire.  No further visual.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

V shaped lights swirl and disappear.;2018-05-13 00:15:00;10 seconds;V shaped lights swirl and disappear. I was getting out of my friends car in DT Reno and happened to look up to the east.  I noticed 5 white lights in perfect V formation traveling N/NE.  Initially I thought it was a large plane making an aggressive turn into the airport, but the angle of the V was perfect 90 degrees and it was very large.  I’m kind of a plane nerd, so I pointed it out to my group of friends how odd it was and as I did this it changed shape. The five lights began swirling around each other and made a spiral then quickly faded and disappeared.  I began yelling about it but none of my friends seemed interested.  I guess they’ve all seen ufo’s before.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
