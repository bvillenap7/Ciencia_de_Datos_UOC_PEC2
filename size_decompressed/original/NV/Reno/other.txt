A silver Ball hovering over McCarran Blvd near Idewild park;1985-06-01 21:00:00;a few minutes;A silver Ball hovering over McCarran Blvd near Idewild park When I was a young child under the age of 10, App. 1985 or 86.  My family and I were traveling from Reno, Nevada to Truckee, CA, to see my Grandpa, as were driving from our home in Lemmon Valley down Virginia we turned onto McCarran Blvd and there were cars parked everywhere along the side of the road and people were standing there looking up at the sky.  We parked and got out and hovering in the sky was a giant silver ball shaped object, it was spinning in place as we stared at it.  I don't remember how long we stood there, but I remember looking at the other people and at this ball, and then all of a sudden jet fighters took off from right behind the MGM Hotel/Casino and the ball shot off at a extremely high speed and was just gone and then the 2 jets took off the same direction.   I remember my parents talking to other people about it, and then we all drove away. I remember there was never anything mentioned about it on the news or anywhere else. I am 34 years old now and still remember it just like yesterday! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

I love towatch the weather. Especially adverse weather.The ball was at least 300ft high if it waswhere I believe it was. It was acompanied byno sound of thunder. Sorry if this sounds like it is not important to me, because it is very important to me.I have been waiting for any kind of sighting.This is my first actual sighting of something and I would apreciate any kind of response.I was sitting with my friend on the computer while on AOL. We were just talking to a friend and watching the snow fall whensuddenly there was a blue light outside. Itwas quite bright from where we were. And itseemed to be coming from some distance away.the start of it was like a huge blue floodlight was on in the SE corner of Reno. Thenit 'erupted' into a huge ball of light. Overapproximately 2 seconds it grew into anapproximate 200-300 feet in diameter. At thatpoint it just seemed to explode into thesky. There was no visible body or mass. Andno sound. The thunder around here can be heardquite well due to Reno's Geological features.It is a valley surrounded by very largemountains. Making the sound travel factorvery high. Regardless, I have never seenany kind of light or fire work or lighteningstrike even remotely close to this.Thank You For Your Time,Brannon G. Blaylock;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

At 1:30 a.m. on April 19th, 1997, I was looking south, towards Reno, from my friend's kitchen window in her home located in Red Rock Estates about 11 miles north of Reno. I observed a huge, brilliant, bow-tie shaped object moving north, toward me, that looked like it was about 20 degrees up from the horizon.  It was too unusual a shape to be a plane or a helicopter and the lights were so brilliant that I stood observing it for 4 to 5 minutes.As it moved over the mountains, it seemed to explode into an enormous sphere of red, green and white individual lights. It stopped moving and seemed to hover above the horizon for 3 to 4 minutes.  Then in seconds, it seemed to twinkle out, first from the bottom of the sphere, finally to the top of the sphere.  Then it was gone.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

It was moving very slowly as if trying to hide in the clouds. I have drawn a picture that closely resembles it. The craft was light gray in color with port-hole like indentations slightly embeded into the edge but not windows or lights. The object was not bright at all. It was very dim and gray almost the same color as the clouds. The craft seemed to be trying to hide in the clouds.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Star-like Object;2003-07-09 23:59:00;6 hours;For the past 2 weeks I have witnessed an interesting repetitive phenomena. Approximately at midnight a star-like object appears to rise in the sky from the Southeast and then travels toward Mt. Rose and Mount Slide near Reno, Nevada. For a time it will stop there, and then travels Southwest until it arrives where it is vertically visable from my bedroom. It remains there until about 4:30 A.M. and then begins to move South again. It is brighter than the North Star. I can't really call this a UFO because it looks like a star, but I have never seen stars traverse the heavens in this manner before. Fallon Air Base is near here, but this had no characteristics of an aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  All stars appear to rotate around Polaris, the north star, because the Earth is rotating on its axis.  The object probably is a star.  PD));39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

the sky looked to me, to be alive with fireants.;2004-01-03 01:00:00;6 hours;the sky looked to me, to be alive with fireants. i often go outside to smoke ciggerettes.ispend a lot of time looking up. so if something is strange or odd i notice it,this morning while looking up i noticed a rather low bright star type object stationary over some apartments across the field from my place,noting that it was strange i decided to try to establish a reference point. about 10 min later i looked out to discover that it had moved to the right and raised up just a little,while this object now had my full attention.and all at once it seemed as if the sky had fireants there were star shaped objects moving all over, meanwhile the first star type light started to move up again and to the right stopping and stay idle from time to time.after about an hour of absolute amazement. more star types started appearing right of me towards the east, again after hovering for sometime two took off straight up leaning towards the left,while another one went right and up towards the sky[the objects seem to take there time sometimes stopping and then moving on.while watching the first star type another craft coming out of the north weststarted heading towards it. i thought it was a plane until it pulled some moves a plane from this planet just could not do.filled with excitement i called for my husband to see,but when he arrived about 3 seconds later it had disappeared,wow.i was hooked out of nowhere appeared what looked liked a meteor or something streaked through the sky from north west to the east it lasted about 2 seconds maybe,objects seemed to be still for a while and they seemed too reposition.about thirty after the first flash appeared a half dome type object it was very bright white, it seemed to have a stream of whatever behind it.it disappeared into the east, ive never seen anything like it before ever.oh im not done yet, while standing there in my utter amazement there was a very bright, large flash again to the east this didnt move,it appeared and disappeared in the same spot.. it made me think that there could be a battle going o! n over our skies. finally about an hour before dawn there was what seemed to me another gathering only this time they appeared out of nowhere and settled in the eastern sky only this time they wore not so shy about moving around, while heading up they almost never went in a straight line,rather moving around quite a bit.just as dawn broke the majority had moved towards heavens.the first two star types were still very bright and identifable as they continued there upward journey. one finally disappeared towards the north, but only after i watched it litterally disappear before my eyes. While i was checking out the last one's ascention there was another burst through the sky this time travelling from the south east and vanishing towards the north. there was quite abit of light at this point, which made it rather wierd.by about 7:30 am the last one slowly faded from view.;39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135

Small plane size rectangular shape with triangular nose, looked to be investigating a small cloud while walking along Offenhauser Dr.;2010-09-21 19:00:00;1 minute;Small plane size rectangular shape with triangular nose, looked to be investigating a small cloud while walking along Offenhauser Dr. It was between Sep and Nov because it was still slightly light out at 6:30 in the evening. It was cold enough to wear my jacket to but not yet winter, I remember that. There was a small amount of clouds in the sky on this evening and they were all a little ways apart from eachother. The person I was walking with said what is that and pointed at the sky. When I looked up I saw what appeared to be a rectangular like object about the size of a small plane with a triangular like top to it that came to a point. This craft looked like it was inspecting this one cloud. There were no wings and no noise. It had blue, green and pinkish streeks coming from the back that looked kind of like what a rocket has behind it when it takes off yet it was not thick nor looked like it was exhaust of anykind. The object was a light metalic silver. It moved around this cloud in such a way and in such speed unlike anything any of our normal average citizens know about that exist in ! our world. Then it just went POOF! Dissappeared just like that, right in front of our eyes. I do know we have nothing that can just dissapear in the blink of an eye, a flash of a second right in front of you. If I could draw a picture it would be imagined like this. The cloud was pretty small and the object went up, stopped, went down behind the cloud, back up through the cloud, then around it and back up then stopped, hovered by this cloud touching the edge of it with its nose and then back behind it, then it went back out and hovered for a second then POOF, it dissappeared. The movements were not of this world. It did not make turns. It just went up then down then through and around and out, its hard to explain it perfectly how it moved. It just did not move like any jets, planes, rockets we have and IT WAS NOT A DAMN WEATHER BALLOON either. There is no EXPLAINING this one away for me. I was not scared at what I was seeing I was amazed. I have always thought they existed ! and I had the privledge of actually seeing one which I am very! proud o f being able to say I have seen one.

Flying west to east, appeared to fly towards Reno International Airport but too high for landing approach. craft of some sort had a tail that appeared to be like a fire tail, but not that bright.  Seems to be twisting somewhat, slow like an aircraft. but the tail made it appear not like an aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.  PD));39.4808242714412;-119.784778830135
Looking south from Reno, object floating, with long trail from west to east.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.

Amendment to my previous report, object flying or floating through air west to east, after hearing reports that it was seen in Southern California, I originally thought it was over towards the Reno Intl Airport, however, my view is due south and it makes sense this item was over SoCal as there was no depth perception to compare to.  Only that the object was travelling too slow to be considered an aircraft.  Object also produced a trail that could be seen in the darkness. ((NUFORC Note:  Space debris.
