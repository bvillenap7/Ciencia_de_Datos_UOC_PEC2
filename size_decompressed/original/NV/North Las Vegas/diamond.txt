((HOAX??))  A diamond brownish dark mass came over my head and down towards the ground.;2015-02-15 23:00:00;4 seconds;Was on my porch looking east in the sky...when a diamond brownish dark mass came over my head and down towards the ground ,  I thought it was a falling star when I first saw it..but as it focused into my view it had strange markings on its back that resembled two nines back to back, and had a dragon scaley apperence...almost reptilian in nature.
