Turquoise orb pulsing in North Las Vegas neighborhood.;2014-02-04 19:50:00;3 minutes;Turquoise orb pulsing in North Las Vegas neighborhood. I pulled out of my driveway and was heading south on my street and I could see a turquoise orb hovering pretty high over the next development closes to Craig Rd.  I thought it was an odd color for a helicopter and it was just sort of hovering so knew it wasn't a plane.   Then I stopped at a stop sign and saw it was signaling in a random pattern.  It would pulse 3 times, wait a few seconds, pulse once, then pulse 4 times.   I was driving to the general area it was hovering over and tried to keep it in view until I could pull in front of my friend's house.   I followed if for a few minutes and then had to turn into the neighborhood and when I did and came to a stop couldn't see it anymore.   I looked for a few mins and even on Craig Rd near the Cannery Casino and never saw it again.  It never changed colors, just a super bright turquoise and silent.;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
