shiny object went behind cloud, but nevr came out the other side.;2002-10-06 18:00:00;2-4 seconds;shiny object went behind cloud, but nevr came out the other side. i was heading north in my dads car and looked to the west and saw a shiny object go behind a cloud. I waited for it to come out of the other side of the cloud to see what it was, but it never came out the other side of the cloud. there were clouds scattered about that day, and there was a mountain named Mt. Charleston in the background. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
Small bright light, Near Nellis AFB, 10 seconds duration.have 10 images.;2017-05-15 14:16:00;12 seconds;Small bright light, Near Nellis AFB, 10 seconds duration.have 10 images. On May 15, 2017, at 216pm PST (partly cloudy) on Las Vegas Blvd, in North Las Vegas.  I have Sony a350 DSLR, 1/2000, iso 400, f8 shooting specs.  I was shooting the Nellis AFB airplanes coming in for a landing.  I was looking North as some airplanes come straight down the Vegas Blvd to do 2 180 degree turns  and land at Nellis, there was about 22 planes in this group.  At about plane 18, I kept looking North down the Blvd and spotted a light coming behind and out of the clouds.  There were a few cloud banks in the area and I began to shoot, even if I couldn't see it, I still kept shooting, I managed to get 10 shots off in 10 or 15 seconds.  I recorded a image on 9 out 10.  The UFO is to far away,about 2 miles to say what it was.  It was like a bright light, but when I blew it up, it looked like a smokey Goldfish Cracker.  I blew it up to about 200 percent and it looked like a cloud of circular smoke. I probably don't have the best equipment to say what it was.  And with! so few pixels, well we don't have enough solid evidence other than it descending path, which can be calculated by time to say, yes this was a UFO.  But the object started up at 1000 ft and pulled a 45 degree descent.  And then just and disappeared.  As the last frame shows it covered some distance really quickly that's why I was determined to just shoot blindly.  My feelings,, about the object, well I never believed that i have a chance to see a UFO.  I knew it wasn't a airplane.  The object just vanished after loosing cloud cover. It was over in 10 seconds or so.  I looked at my time and it never clicked over 2:16 pm, while taking these photos.  Enjoy we are;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
