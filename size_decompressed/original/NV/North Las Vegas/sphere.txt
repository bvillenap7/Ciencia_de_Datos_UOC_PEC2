3 White spheres in Las Vegas on memorial day.;2005-05-30 11:00:00;6 hours;3 White spheres in Las Vegas on memorial day. 2 white sphere appeared from the northeast just north of the mountain that is just north of the northern 215 beltway near Aliante Parkway.   They were hovering in all directions. seemed to disapear and then reapear on the north western side of the mountain.  Did this all afternoon.  One of the objects was hovering in one spot for several hours. Easy to see and very bright in person but very hard to see and photograph with a camera.  Some of the spheres moved in front of the mountain almost touching the ground and then going back up so high into the sky you could barely see them.   I have not seen anything since yesterday afternoon but to get to the mountain where this was happening, take 95 north to the 215 and head east.  Once your at aliante parkway, the mountain to your left is where all of this happend on may 30, 2005. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I looked outside and saw 2 orbs flying right next to eachother, practically touching.  They slowly moved away from eachother, still flying parallel to eachother and in the same direction.  There were airplanes and other unknown aircraft flying around the area.;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
4 Bright Sphere like objects in North Las Vegas;2019-12-19 13:00:00;10 minutes;4 Bright Sphere like objects in North Las Vegas Was outside on a very clear day in NLV with my neighbor, My neighbor saw 3 bright sphere like objects in the sky very very high up!  I then looked an saw myself all 3 then saw a 4th.  My husband came outside and we got a telescope and binoculars & still saw objects which were moving closer together.  What was really strange was when a plane came passed ( way below the objects ) the objects cloaked and then came back after the plane was gone!    This all took about 15 minutes.  Our postal lady also looked up and saw the objects after she asked what we were all looking at so total of 4 people.  But 3 people definitely saw these very real Sphere & bright objects in the sky today.;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
