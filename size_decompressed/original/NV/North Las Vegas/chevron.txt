Crescent/chevron/boomerang shaped HUGE (200-300ft across) craft flying very low and completely silently over fiesta casino parking lot.  Was shining flashlight into air at other odd crafts/lights and it flew over and stopped to check us out.  Crescent shaped front and jagged back.  Almost  camouflaged into sky because it was so matt black.  Could only see when directly over head, then slowly flew out of view.  There were helicopters and fighter jets everywhere and other unidentifyed crafts/lights moving around in the area that we were shining our flashlight at and that's when this large craft showed up over us because we were investigating the other crafts.  May have been small red lights on craft, but very dim.;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
