While swimming in the pool (with my husband) I saw a glowing yellow/orange light, very bright, it almost hurt my eyes.  It did not make a sound.  I pointed it out to my husband and it just kept coming towards us.   It was moving very slowly from west to east.  It was almost like it was floating.  It moved up and down in a way a plane cannot move.   It turned north and moved toward the mountains behind our house.  It went into a cloud and you could see it turn off its light as soon as it moved into the cloud.    After a few more minutes there was a second one.  This one was more reddish than orange it moved the same way and made no sound.   We heard some neighbor say hey there is a UFO, maybe a few houses down.  I was so scared I got out of the pool.   My husband watched it very closely and this second one turned off its light before getting to the cloud and he could see it was big and egg shaped. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded to us to be quite eloquent and serious-minded.  She emphasized how dramatic the sighting was.
