Green Fire Ball Falling From The Sky;2003-12-14 19:45:00;3seconds;Green Fire Ball Falling From The Sky Tonight I was going to the grocery store going West on craige road when on the corner of my eye I see what appeared to be a green fire ball with a tail. I would compare the color to a bright green signal light on the street. The object was falling down at a diagonal direction, traveling West at a high speed. This was the second time that I've seen this. The first one that I saw was back in January of 1999 at 0545hr. I wasn't the only one that saw this one which fell behind the mountains west of Las vegas. I'm thinking that these fire balls that I've seen are Meteorites?;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
