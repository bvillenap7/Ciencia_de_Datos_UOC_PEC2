I could see the Star or planet (im not sure which) and to the bottom left I could what i thought was a star.   As I came over the last big hill before you can see town.  I noticed as I moved south that this star was moving-ever so slowly up-in the five or so minutes it doubled altitude.  I would guess it to be about 10 miles out-since I could clearly see the planes coming in from the north over the mountains with their strobes and red lights on.  Mc Claren Airport would be about 20 miles from where I first saw the light (star).   As I approached the city the star had gained altitutde and then slowly just winked out.  Other than the aircraft for McClaren and Henderson I didnt see anything else like it.  I am a professional trucker.;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
White light over N. Las Vegas, NV.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS passed overhead here at 20:30 hrs.  PD));2011-05-05 20:33:00;1 minute;White light over N. Las Vegas, NV I'm a paramedic in Las Vegas and was just sitting in my ambulance looking at the sky when I noticed a light (bright off white) moving very slowly across the sky.  There were no blinking lights.  I could tell it was very high up.  The object seemed to slowly fade until it disappeared (Not do to distance).   For all I know it could have been a shooting star, but not like one I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS passed overhead here at 20:30 hrs.  PD));36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
Flashing lights, moving objects and odd movements;2012-10-21 02:00:00;55 minutes;flashing lights, moving objects and odd movements 2:15am i stepped outside to smoke a cigarette. I looked to my left (i  was on the balcony) the light was at my 10oclock.  It looked like a star at first, then i seen it drop down to the tree line, then shoot back up near the end of orions belt.  It would periodically shoot left and right, up and down and one time it did a circle formantion.  I watched this light for half an hour when i see a streak of light ( similar to lightning, the sky was clear) shoot across and disappear near the first light. at 3am i see another light, red only flash six times then it was gone. the first light stayed put for another half hour, then me and two others see a ( shadow of sorts) move along the grass and tree. it was quick but we seen it. it scared them enough to go back inside the house. i kept watching and at about 4am the light i first seen shot up and over to west faster than any plane ive ever seen and disappeared.;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
Two lights north of Las Vegas, hovering and eventually gliding until it disappeared.;2016-09-03 01:08:00;5-10 seconds;Two lights north of Las Vegas, hovering and eventually gliding until it disappeared. I was out working out in the backyard of my home at around 1am while listening to Coast to Coast am. My backyard faces north, the house faces south. I had a clear view of the northern sky, Nellis AFB is to my north east at about less than 7 miles from my home. I have seen many terrestrial and known objects in the skies: satellites, fireballs, shooting stars and even unique aircraft like the stealth bomber, all within the city limits. Tonight, I saw something that was very unconventional to the aforementioned objects. The object was simply two lights, one bright light and another less bright light at around the 11 o'clock mark above the brighter light. The object just appeared out of nowhere towards the north and not anywhere near the AFB, I would say the AFB is more north easterly while this object was straight north. The distance between the 2 lights was greater than the distance of an airplane's wingspan, that is what caught my eye. As I saw the object, the lights seemed to hoover and then eventually glide in perfect unison at an angle, the reason I think I was seeing it at an angle, is because I was assuming I was looking at a solid object but looking it at while it was making some sort of turn. The object glided and it seemed to move east at first and then eventually turned north and disappeared, the disappearance was odd because it seemed like it disappeared into some sort of haze or fog, but there were no clouds that night. It might have disappeared behind the mountain, but that does not explain how both lights just vanished, as if flying into a cloud, which I have seen aircraft do flying behind mountains and clouds. This was definitely the closest thing to a UFO I have seen. I did take a video of the even, but the image is too dark to see anything.;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
Bright object above mountains at distance, dims, and moves away.;2016-12-29 22:23:00;2-3 minutes;Bright object above mountains at distance, dims, and moves away. There was a bright object that was low at the horizon at the very northeast corner of the sky.   At first I thought it was a star or planet that was low in the horizon, I check my smartphone, on some astronomy apps,and what not, and didn't show it was any natural thing that bright as objects that close to the horizon tend to look bigger.  The object was definitely above the mountains as well.  I watched it for about a minute and a half at least over a wall about 3 feet from me that is about 6 feet tall, I'm 5'9.  And then suddenly the object dims considerably and moves off heading east, to recall even further it seemed to look like a slight streak moving, I had to step a couple of times to my left  to see it go because it was being obstructed by a palm tree.  I saw this in my backyard which faces north.  As far as I could tell it isn't any type of aircraft I have seen since I live close to Nellis AFB.  My best guess is a helicopter but it didn't have any blinking lights and it was far off in the distance away from the city and above the mountains.  I'm at a loss as to what the object may be.;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569

A singular white light appears heading;2018-04-23 03:43:00;15 seconds;Looking northeast to airspace of Nellis AFB, which is about 5 and a half miles from my location.  A singular white light appears heading towards to my direction, the light was bright as Jupiter, as if I was staring at a plane with headlights turned on.   Then the light dimmed and starting moving southeast, the dimmed light didn't look like any flight related lights I've seen and it didn't have a pattern in its blinking, it looked as if it was twinkling due to it being a heat source or due to the atmosphere but it was definitely not a pattern typical of airplanes.  There also no sound of any kind that I would have heard in a quiet night.  A heliporter sound would have been a dead giveaway and I also checked on my smartphone for nearby planes to see what it was and nothing showed up for that portion of the sky.  And I have seen satellites and falling rocks.  The appearance and behavior of this object tells me it is unknown.

Numerous North bound lights.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-05 20:00:00;10 minutes;Numerous North bound lights Relaxing in jacuzzi looking at the stars and notice a flashing dot moving through the sky.  As it went past another dot and another dot , repeated 30 dots in uniform line of travel.  1st I thought satalite but I see 1 satellite once in a while but I counted 30 before I started to feel anxious.  Idk.  Any way to check what all was known in the sky .  Close to nellis afb. To high to see anymore than a light.;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
Saw multiple white lights moving at high speeds and disappearing and reappearing and also flashing on and off in formation at one point;2020-07-16 21:00:00;45 minutes;Saw multiple white lights moving at high speeds and disappearing and reappearing and also flashing on and off in formation at one point At approx 8:45 I went outside to see if I could see the comet, which I could not, and a white orb - no blinking at all -  caught my eyes to the NE.  It came down very fast and I've seen 2 lights similar to it in recent months so I turned on my camera on Iphone and recorded video.  It descended very fast and then hit what seemed to be a specific altitude and headed north at a slower pace and out of my view.  I stayed outside and then witness a very similar light to my north again that travelled west for approx 2 secs before disappearing.  It sort of faded into black within 1 second.  I waited for another 30 mins before witnessing what appeared to be 3 of the same lights in a triangle formation flashing on and off.  I waited for 20 more mins and did not see them again.  I will submit the video and a blown up image of the first frame. If you scroll through the video frame by frame you can see the distinct shape of the object.  Appeared disc shaped at times with! a dome.  I know how that sounds, but you can see the picture.;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
