M. in North Las Vegas, NV. On 9-12-08 at around 8 P.M. I was returning home from work and dinner. I was alone and had entered my complex when I saw a large saucer shaped spacecraft. My first thought was that what I was seeing could not be for real. It was so big and unmistakably an alien craft, or a projection of one, that I could not believe what I was seeing. It appeared to be spinning and changed colors. The only colors I remember vividly were pink and green. Because of the size of the craft, I started to get nervous thinking that this could be an invasion. Instead of stopping I slowly turned down my street and eventually lost sight of the craft. I pulled into the driveway and went into the house for my binoculars. I was not able to find it again. When I returned to my house I put on the Sunday night Football game to get the score and I had some old fashioned radio like static for a couple of minutes. I can not believe no one else saw this.;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
Black Dish with small point on top between Las Vegas and Nellis AFB.;2017-08-11 16:00:00;3 minutes;Black Dish with small point on top between Las Vegas and Nellis AFB. Around 3PM to 3:15 PM on 8/11/2017, I was watching lightning from outside a casino in North Las Vegas. I noticed in the SW a tiny black dot slowly going upward a little to the left and right.  I thought it was a Mylar balloon that someone had let go of. Then it just stopped mid air, and then it started moving NE slowly just outside a storm cell I was watching.  It appeared to be entering just inside and outside of the Cloud Cell. As it got closer, it appeared to be just near Stratosphere Casino but much higher in the sky like ½ mile higher in the sky.  It was well defined at this point, black, flat on the bottom with a small point on the top center of it. At around Stratosphere Casino, it stopped again, and then started increasing speed, and in a matter of maybe 3 to 4 seconds, it went from Stratosphere Casino, to just left of Nellis AFB.  It looked like it was on a collision course with the mountains, when I lost sight of it as it went under my line of site as trees were to the East of me and the mountains. I heard no noise, no sonic booms, and did not hear any impact and did not see any visible signs of debris flying up as if it impacted something. From my vantage point, I can see Stratosphere to Nellis AFB, I guess that’s maybe what 25 miles between the two of them?  As it speeded up from virtually a stand still hover over Stratosphere to speeding out of site, it only took about 3 to 4 seconds travel that 20 to 25 miles, I know when the jets hit their burners, you see the thrusters flames and loud, like I said this was totally silent and no flames, just extremely fast and quick. It was traveling much faster than the fighter jets that pass by here every day. I was going to inquire to Nellis AFB if they caught a blimp on their radar site around 3 to 3:15 PM, but don’t know how to report it.  Google just popped up with you.;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
