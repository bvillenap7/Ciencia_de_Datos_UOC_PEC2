At Midnight I looked into the sky and had seen seven fireball looking lights.   As I looked in amazement I see that there is not just a fireball light but a red blinking light.  I get binoculars to see up close (I had them handy) and see its in a shape of a triangle.  I watched the sky longer to see 3 more one by one fly up.  It seemed as if they were taking off from the airport by my house.  Inclining and gaining speed it looks as if these air crafts can hover and glide, like the sky were one big playground.;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
