Cluster Formation of Red Slow Moving Star-like Objects;2012-04-06 21:30:00;5 minutes;Cluster Formation of Red Slow Moving Star-like Objects We were headed back to our car in the parking lot and spotted a cluster of very slowly moving red star-like objects.  We watched for a moment and they did not appear to change  color or flash in any manner (As a helicopter light would), only seemed to head in the direction of North at an extremely slow pace. Three of the objects were in a large triangle shaped flying pattern the other 4 or so were trailing behind in an un-patterned cluster. As I got out my phone to take a picture, a few of the objects had already dissappeared.  The group of three seemed to not move for a moment of time then slowly began to move again and then dissipate. My picture turned up with many perfectly rounded & spaced red auras with an odd shaped white disk-like light. This happened at the edge of North Las Vegas as you enter into the Mountainous desert region.;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
