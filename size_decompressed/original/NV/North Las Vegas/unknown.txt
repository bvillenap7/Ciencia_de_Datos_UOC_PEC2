So i looked up to see if it was indeed just that.  But when i looked up all i saw was a blue after burner the kind one woul see on a military air craft when its all full power on after burner.  Diffirence was there was no sound and it was gone in a split second all i saw was the trail from the heat that is created at high altitudes.  First time i ever see anything of the sort intrigued and confused is me right now. Thought id share it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Something reflecting high in the sky heading from Soring Mountain range East towards Nellis AFB.;2019-03-25 07:30:00;20 minutes;Never seen anything like this. Close to Nellis and Lamb T approx 7:30 am saw something reflecting high in the sky heading from Soring Mountain range East towards Nellis AFB.   After about 5 minutes travel east (moving slow), changed course to head South.  Looked through monocular (cheap one unfortunately) I could see it was not a balloon and appeared to be u see intelligent control.   At least 10 other people I saw looking and pointing at it.   Finally disappeared at approx 7:50 am;36.2552341463414;-115.149556910569
