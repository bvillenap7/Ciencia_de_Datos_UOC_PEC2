This became visable to us as we climbed in elevation so, by the time we noticed it it was very large, suggesting it was fairly close.  It was much larger than the moon would appear to be if in the same position. The very center of the ball had a green tint that was only noticable if viewed with peripheral vision.  Also, there was a red tail eminating from the green center that extended downward at about 45 degrees.  The object seemed to grow in diameter and lessen in intensity over the next five minutes until it disappeared. It was cloudlike and I would best describe it as an explosion of some sort.  As the light diminished we noticed two other objects, much smaller.  One looked to be heading south at a high rate of speed just over the horizon of the Seirra's, while the other appeared to be dropping from the explosion.  This object moved erratically as if it were debris.  Both of these objects also looked like small comets, looking like small flashlights in the sky.  They may have been aircraft or helicopters?  One was definetly flying, but the other seemed to be floating downward and not in control.  Both were approximately the same size and had the same level of intensity.  I've read other posts at this sight from the Fresno area, and although I thought this was much closer to us in Nevada this may have been the same object(s).  I'm not trying to jump on any bandwagon but since I saw this thing I've been searching the web to see if anyone else saw anything.  I really believed at the time that an airliner exploded.  This object was so large I assumed that many people had to see it.;38.8447;-119.3523
