pulsating diamond shapped object;2009-08-27 05:15:00;30;pulsating diamond shapped object I woke up at 5 AM and noticed a bright light in the sky that appeared to be an aircraft with landing lights on.  I grabbed my HD videocamera with 10x optical zoom and 150 digital zoom and recorded a pulsating diamond-shaped object approximately 25 degrees above the horizon east of my residence.   I woke up my daughter and her friend to witness this, along with a co-worker to pick me up for work.  The object was not moving.;38.8447;-119.3523
