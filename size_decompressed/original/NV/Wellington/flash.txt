Flashing Light;2010-07-09 23:00:00;10 minutes;Flashing Light Looking south from the constellation Lyra, the two witnesses noticed a light blink on and then off. This continued with three other distinct signlas such as a ship sending morse code. The blinking stopped after ten mintues (approx.), the blinking did not get any brighter than surrounding stars, (5th magnitude). It appeared to us that the blinking was deliberate and not due to atmospheric conditions (stars twinkling) it appeared to us as a flashlight at some distance turning on and off.;38.8447;-119.3523
