Object flying across the sky.;2019-04-17 11:00:00;1 minute;Object flying across the sky Saw an object that looked strange flying across the sky while waiting at a stop light.  I snapped a few quick pictures while also watching the street light.  I tried to turn around and take more pictures, but the object was gone.  When I looked at my pictures, in addition to the object I saw, there were 2 other white balls higher up in the sky.;39.5964;-119.7758
