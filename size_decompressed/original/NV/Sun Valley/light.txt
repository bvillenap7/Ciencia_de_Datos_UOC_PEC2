My son and I were headed South on Carrol Street and stopped at E. Gepford Parkway.  A bright light enveloped our car, and there was a lesser red light.  The engine on my car lost power and after only 15 seconds the light was gone and the car engine came back to full operation.    On the way back home about 15 minutes later there was a group of 5 or 6 girls who were stand near E. Gepford Parkway and all of them looked scared.  One of the girls looked like they wanted to say something but like a dummy, I drove on. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
