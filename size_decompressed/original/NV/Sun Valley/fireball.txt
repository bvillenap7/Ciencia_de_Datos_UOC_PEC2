My son and I were coming home on Carrol Street, going North toward 4th Street.  About half way down Carrol street a fireball about the size of a basketball flew down from behind us and keep up with the speed of the car and flew by the passenger side window a yard of so away.  The ball was orange in the center with red around it and it had a tail on the end that was orange and red around it.  It flew about 10 seconds or so with us then did a sort of back flip and flew off.
