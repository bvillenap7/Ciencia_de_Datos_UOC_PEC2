rectangle object with plus and minus symbols was not seen until pix was enlarged.;2005-09-24 09:30:00;unknown;rectangle object with plus and minus symbols was not seen until pix was enlarged. WE WERE WATCHING AN ANNUAL HOT-AIR BALLOON EVENT ON SATURDAY MORNING. THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE OBSERVING AS THE BALLOONS ENDED THEIR FLIGHTS AND WERE LANDING IN VARIOUS PLACES AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  I TOOK PICTURES OF AN EAGLE BALLOON. AT THE TIME WE DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING UNSUAL (APPARENTLY NO-ONE ELSE DID, EITHER).   AT A LATER DATE AS I WAS DOWNLOADING PICTURES FROM THE SONY HANDHELD CAMCORDER ONTO MY LAPTOP,  WE NOTICED A SMALL DARK RECTANGULAR OBJECT UP AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE EAGLE-HOT-AIR-BALLOON.   CURIOUS, WE ENLARGED IT REPEATEDLY.  WE SEE A DARKER BAND THROUGH THE CENTER BUT ARE MOST INTERESTED IN THE PLUS'S AND MINUS'S AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE OBJECT.  THEY ARE MOST VISIBLE WHEN WE CHANGE THE ANGLE OF THE COMPUTER SCREEN.  WE HAVE TRIED TO GET THE SAME RESULT WITH OTHER PIX, BUT CAN'T. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides e-address only.

Large lime-green luminescent rectangle, lights moving within it,   in the southeastern sky at 9:10pm Pacific Time.;2008-04-24 21:10:00;3 seconds;Large lime-green luminescent rectangle, lights moving within it,   in the southeastern sky at 9:10pm Pacific Time. Looking southeast out my window before going to bed, it was totally black outside. This was quite unusual.(I live in a rural area and always see a few house lights, snow on the mountains, and occasional car headlights in the distance.) In the upper left corner of my window I saw a large luminescent lime green rectangular object with rounded corners. In the 2-3 seconds I saw it, it did not appear to be moving. There was no glow, trail, aura or beams from this object going to the ground or sky. All the luminescence and color were contained in the rectangle. Inside the rectangle there appeared to be other colors of perhaps yellow-green or silver-white that I can only say reminded me of plumbing pipe shapes. There appeared to be movement of the light within these shapes.  All of this happened within a few seconds and as I thought what in the world is this?, before the whole sentence was formed in my mind, the rectangle light flickered out, as if a switch had been turned off. It was still completely black outside my window. I went outside within five seconds. All looked normal. No airplanes, satellites, barking dogs - nothing to indicate anything out of the ordinary had just happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.
