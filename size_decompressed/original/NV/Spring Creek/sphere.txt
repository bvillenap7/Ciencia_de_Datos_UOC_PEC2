Glowing streak stretched across the sky clearly being investigated by a fleet of UFO's.;2012-06-12 10:45:00;30 minutes;Glowing streak stretched across the sky clearly being investigated by a fleet of UFO's. 12 of June 2012 around 10:45 am on the way to work I noticed a very long orange trail stretching across the skies from one cloud bank to another.  The trail was glowing and readily visible from within the clouds as well.  When it began transitioning in color from orange to red I went back to my house (at this point I was only a minute away from home) in order to retrieve my camera and take photographs of this event.  By the time I got my camera set up the trail had shifted in color from red to green and blue.  I snapped several pictures of the event then left for work.  Things of note: 1 The sun was nearly overhead 2 The surrounding clouds were doing nothing like the trail in its color transitions.  I finished my work load for the day and copied the photos from my memory card over to the computer and was blown away by what was in the photos.  I seemingly photographed several UFO's investigating this very strange trail in the sky.  Upwards of 52 UFO's can clearly be seen in one of the photographs. The photographs were taken on a Nikon D3100 at the highest possible resolution (12.4 MP) and are of good quality considering all I had was a 18mm-55mm Lens Kit.;40.7533;-115.5985

We watched a round white orb move slowly from north to south, no lights no sound.  With naked eye, it appeared to have vapor trail, but with high powered binoculars, it was perfectly round.

Spring Creek, NV, UFO sighting.;2018-10-17 02:36:00;45+ minutes;Spring Creek NV UFO sighting At approximately 2:34 am, I noticed a strange  light out of my bathroom window.  I watched it for a few min and noticed it had bight blue and white lights around the entire craft.  I though maybe it could be a plane but it started to move very quickly in a zig zag motion.   I was so focused on the one craft that I didnâ€™t notice another one right above that one and it was moving the same way.  It had the same lights around the object too.   I watched both of them for over an hour, there is no way those were man made crafts because they moved in zigzag movements that no plane or jet could ever do.  It moved so fast and erratic.;40.7533;-115.5985
