Large White lighted cloud 15 miles Across Seen Elko Nv  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 19:00:00;10 minutes;Large White lighted cloud 15 miles Across Seen Elko Nv Walked out of my house and noticed part of the sky was lite up. Part was covered up by wood fence so i go to get a better look at it. I look up and seen a huge cloud that was oval shaped. Was at least 15miles long and 10 miles deep. It had a white bright glow to it. And would also say it was 4 miles high. Gave me very spooky feeling. I studied it looking for oddities. on the south end of it there was a round brighter white and on the north side there was a whiter patch also. It was not a ufo i believe just more like a portal. And while watching this it is getting dimmer.  Also the sky was very clear and no other clouds around.I go back in the house come back out 5 min later.  And the white aura cloud is almost gone. but now i can see at least 3 jets flying around seeing there red becons flashing where the huge cloud area was glowing. This lightened cloud should of been seen my 100s. was quit the anomolly. like to here back what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));40.7533;-115.5985
