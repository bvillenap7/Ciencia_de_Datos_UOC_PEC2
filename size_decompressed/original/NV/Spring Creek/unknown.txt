We turned out all of the lights to see it beter and we could not make out it's shape. It had lights almost like a plane but not. We got out our telescope out and realized it was something we had never seen before. Electrically charged we could tell, very colorful straight out of Star Trec looking thing. Never lost it's line shape, traveled at speeds no plane could and changed colors often. We watched for hours and could not figure out what it was any ideas? I don't usually believe in these things however I saw this and know I am not crazy.;40.7533;-115.5985
