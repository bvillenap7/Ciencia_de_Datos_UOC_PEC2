All four of us saw a white coin shaped object.  Outlining the craft was a bright green light.  From the naked eye it flashed colors.  The telescope revealed runes on whatever it was.  Shortly after we drove.  I looked east towards Wells and saw a Huge vapor trail 3 times the width of the moon and miles wide.   We pulled over to inspect it.  It was long and would pinch off at points and expand.   We continued down the road and saw a blue streak shoot north across our windshield quickly.  It was huge with blue tracers unlike a comet meteor or shooting star. ((e-address deleted));40.7533;-115.5985
