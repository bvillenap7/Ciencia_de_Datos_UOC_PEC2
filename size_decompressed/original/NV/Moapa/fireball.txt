A total of 6 fireball type orbs over the southern Nevada desert.;2014-10-22 18:00:00;30 minutes;A total of 6 fireball type orbs over the southern Nevada desert. I was traveling Northbound on I-15 and to the west of me by about 1-2 miles away were fireball like objects appearing and moving ominously over the desert 200 yards or so off the ground. I saw two at first and then as many as six. I am more than familiar with all types of known military craft.  These were unlike anything I had seen before, flying or seemingly hovering in the night sky. This was at dusk and I could see the dim light the orb type fireball would emit until they became bright for just a few moments. The objects did move up and down and at a diagonal. They seemed to be able to move at much greater speed than the aircraft that seemed to be trying to keep up and track the objects. I did count four aircraft in all trying to keep up with these things. The objects would be dim at a very light blue and then get brighter with a bright orange, fire like color and they were in a staggered formation but not uniformly staggered from right to left, one higher! than the other almost in an elongated W pattern. The objects made no sound.;36.6928;-114.6523
