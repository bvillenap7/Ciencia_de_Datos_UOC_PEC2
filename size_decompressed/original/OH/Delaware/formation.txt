So I checked my ISS tracker app.  The ISS was over Asia at that time. So I looked up again and saw two more.  They were traveling from west to northeast across the night sky.  There was a total of 3.  They were white in my binoculars.  They were moving at a constant speed and all three were equidistant from one another. They did not blink or pulse and had no green or red lights.  Why would three satellites travel in formation?  This is odd to me.;40.2937999999997;-83.0743999999998
