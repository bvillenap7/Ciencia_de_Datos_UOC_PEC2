This is now the third or fourth time since moving into this area a couple of years ago that I have seen large brightly lit objects of indeterminate shape floating out over a largely deserted rural area West of the City.  Last night coming from a meeting and dinner out, I observed a very large brightly lit object floating, for lack of a better term, just over the tree line headed West (there is a small commercial airport) West of the City.  However, this object, didn't seem to be moving like an aircraft in a landing pattern.  Object was barely moving!  What attracted my attention was the unusual configuration of the lights which seemed to be in a row all on one side facing me.  This was as big as a dirigible or blimp, but didn't seem to emit any sound.  It was of indeterminate distance, and size.  I am only filing this report in the event someone else in this area saw it and might be encouraged to file a report themselves.  As big as this was I don't see how anybody could miss seeing it!;40.2937999999997;-83.0743999999998
