Orange-white lights move over tree line and then disappear into sky;2015-08-22 21:00:00;15 minutes;Orage-white lights move over tree line and then disappear into sky While camping near Alum Creek Lake we were sitting by a small campfire, my girlfriend looked up and said look at this light.  It was orange- red and then changed to a whitish color with some red mixed in. It started above a treeline then moved in a steady but fast speed, then it accelerated upward then disappeared slowly into the atmosphere.  Another orange-red object appeared over the treeline, very similar to first object it also accelerated up into the atmosphere and disappeared. 2 other similar lights appeared, then in same formation disappeared into the sky. These sightings were almost exactly what I had witnessed in Mt. Vernon, Ohio, on 7/4/15 just prior to their fireworks display at Ariel Foundation Park, the only difference, the objects started as red oval objects above a treeline, then changed from red to the white orange type lights and then accelerated up into the sky.  No small plane could accelerate at the speed these lights did and then disappear into the atmosphere. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
