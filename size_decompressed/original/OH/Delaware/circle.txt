I got up and went to the bathroom. We have 3 large windows that look over lots of acreage and are on the county line in Delaware Ohio. The house next door was under construction and the night was clear blue and it was spring.  I looked out to enjoy the view when a large light came across the field from the north heading south ,several stories off the ground over Hillsmiller Road that runs East & West. It was in a straight line going so quickly over the grassy field ( it zipped) to the new building. The light seemed curious zipped right,l eft and up and down and also hovered. looking or investigating the house.  I was not scared but when I drew closer to the window the light zipped up and stright over the new build and south into the woods hovered and zip it was gone.  My husband and I are both medical professionals, I did not wake him but I knew I saw something that changed my entire belief abt UFO's.  I saw no other reports that next day but later that week my husband caught reports of sightings elsewhere in the US. I will mail a map of the sighting and county map that shows our road etc...  I looked on the net for info on reporting right after the sighting and the few web sites I pulled up were so odd I gave up trying to find a place to report this to, our local airport thought I was nuts.  Then my husband thought I should watch the Jennings report and I saw who to legitimately report the sighting to.  To draw the object is to draw the headlight of a huge motorcycle light but with no light beam, just a (1) round large ball of light 1 acre away it looked the size of 2-3 feet across. 2 stories high off the ground, to low to be an aircraft.  no sound with this light, no beam, or mechanical movement, it moved like light its self, but with a purpose  What is the chance the light will revisit?

Circle of lights in Ohio;2012-05-07 21:30:00;2 minutes;Circle of lights in Ohio Lifting weights in garage with friend, went outside and looked up to the sky to observe the moon.  Heard from a neighbor earlier that evening how big it was supposed to be.  It was big.  Looked around the sky, and opposite the moon was a  straight formation of circular lights, unmoving.   I thought they may be stars but they still looked odd.    We watched for a minute or so and the lights seemed to get brighter, then dimmer, then brighter again.  It was very faint because it seemed pretty far away.   Then the lights moved together in a circular motion (blurred) and they disappeared very soon afterwards.    Looked around for a few minutes and did not find them again.;40.2937999999997;-83.0743999999998
