Right before going to sleep, after spending several hours of reading, I often turn out the lights in my apartment and look out toward the woods bordering our property from my living room window.  Something, a flash of light or pinpoint of light with motion caught my eye.  Looking due North I saw a brilliant white light about a dime in circumfurance rise up from behind the tree line, stand stock still for perhaps 30 seconds, and then begin moving forward on a direct line apparently meant to intersect and pass over our apartment building.  Being stunned and slightly incredulous, I just sat there staring as it moved very, very slowly directly on a straight line probably a couple of hundred feet in altitude.  I saw it move directly overhead and pass from view.  I llstened very intently, turning off my floor fan as soon as I knew it was on the move!  Its light was intense, white, unwavering, and constant.  There was absolutely no sound, even after it passed overhead.  I continued to stand watch at the window another 10 or 15 minutes trying to clarify, for my own benefit, what I had just witnessed.  It definitely was not a plane, blimp, ultra-lite craft, heliocopter, or any other aerial craft I have ever seen, since its motion was more like floating than flying.  This is the clearest view, yet of what I have been seeing in the skies in this area since sometime in the Fall last year.  Did anyone else see this, is my first question? I am a rational, responsible male, having held several government jobs requiring security clearances!  Thank YOU!;40.2937999999997;-83.0743999999998
Flashing Large lights like intense headlights on the bedroom wall over my bed at night!;2003-10-15 23:30:00;2-3 seconds;Flashing Large lights like intense headlights on the bedroom wall over my bed at night! Was not going to report this, but read another account for Hartford, WI which recounted an experience, similar to possibly three or four experiences I have had at nightin the past 18 months.  One of those experiences I reported on an earlier date that occurred last year.  I was awakened from a sound sleep by a blinding light which looked like a full Moon, but didn't make any sense at the time.  Later, I called a local observatory and found out that my experience happened on a night when the Moon was not full, and that the direction it would have been in made it impossible for what I saw to be the MOON.  Now in the past three months or so I have seen a light flash above my head over the bed on the wall in my bedroom.  There has not been any sound, but I am extremely agitated some nights and find it hard to go to sleep ever since the last experience with the light coming through my venetian blinds.  The first instance with this experience happened here the Summer before last.  I have found praying the Rosary, helps me go to sleep.  I only started doing the Rosary on October 18th this year.  I find that saying it while I am laying in bed helps me go to sleep and the fear factor has diminished due to this practice.  I had not felt compelled to say the Rosary for years and am what some would call a fallen away Catholic.  By coincidence the night I started saying the Rosary a friend gave me one.  The gift came a day or so after a good friend died.  Something neither the giver of the gift or myself were aware of, so the coincidental nature of all this is very strange.  Another event, I have not formally reported occurred last March and involved a huge triangle over the edge of the property where the driveway is situated which curves around to the apartment in which I have lived for close to two years now! I noticed around the time of my experience a pilot of a private jet aircraft saw a similar object in the air about 140 nautical miles SE of Columbus which is located approximately 20 miles S of where I am living.  I was never sure of the date of that occurrence, but have wondered if what he and I saw occurred on the same night.  He saw a huge triangle which is what I saw also!  Appreciate this website since it is helping me to relate and understand that other people are having the same expeiences I am.  It also helps jog my memory about them, since somehow I have a natural tendency to deny or block the stuff from myself!  That kind of bothers me and makes me wonder if there are other suppressed memories that my mind refuses to cull up? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.2937999999997;-83.0743999999998

The first sighting was around 5:45 P.M. It caught my eye because I thought I saw a plane in the air but had some unique festive like red and green bright lights.  The object was estimated to be 50 feet above the tree tops, hovered slowly, with no engine sounds.  It would make a complete stop and then continue slowly south east.  Ok..festive lights on a airplane is possible but I can not give a good description because it almost seemed foggy err transparent. The second sighting was at 8:30 P.M.;40.2937999999997;-83.0743999999998
Small red light object seen above Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, OH.;2008-10-29 07:50:00;1minute;Small red light object seen above Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, OH. So early Wednesday morning at 7:50 a.m., October 29th, 2008, I was walking from my dorm building to my chemistry class, which was all the way across campus. At Ohio Wesleyan University the campus is split in half, almost, by part of Sandusky St. As I was waiting to cross the road, I looked up above Slocum Hall and saw a little red light. I got really excited at first, because I thought that I may be looking at a planet. Yet, all of the sudden it was gone. I thought that my eyes might be playing tricks on me since it was so early in the morning, so I rubbed and blinked my eyes and then tried to find it. But, it was gone. About 30 seconds later it showed up again in the same place I first saw it in. However this time it got really bright, faded until it was almost gone, and then got really bright again and disappeared again. Almost instantly, it appeared again but this time about 50 to 100 or 200 feet to the left, now over University Hall/Gray Chapel, and then it disappeared for good, almost as fast as it had reappeared. I was wondering if anyone had anything to say about this mysterious sighting. Note that there was no noise which accompanied this sighting. Also, the light was small, redish white to red in color, orb shaped, and moved at a high speed.;40.2937999999997;-83.0743999999998
Drone light.;2015-08-12 22:00:00;5 seconds;Drone light Large yellow light moving at moderate speed.  Low altitude.   Suddenly appeared with a solid light,  flying for about 5 seconds then dissapeared.;40.2937999999997;-83.0743999999998
3 bright lights.;2017-05-21 23:02:00;2 minutes;3 bright lights I had just come out of my garage and looked up at the clouds and saw 3 bright plusing lights, the first light looked like it was being followed/chased.  Then the first light looked like it stoped in the air and the second light slowed as it approached the first one, then i lost them both in a cloud bank as it has been stormy here today, then there were 2 flashes in the cloud.  that was when i noticed the 3rd light coming up from the south very fast then that one got lost from my line of sight to in a cloud bank too.  All of this toom place over a few minutes, i tried to get cell phone video, but i pressed the wrong button and didn't  record anything.  It didn't occur to me till after but there were no helicopter or jet sounds, i would guess the objects  were at an altitude of 2500-10,000 feet as they flew up into the clouds.  I waited for the cloud banks to pass to see if they were still in the area i saw them but they were not.  I would guess they went back south or east or southeast, since it was clear to the other directions.;40.2937999999997;-83.0743999999998
1 bright red orb.  ((NUFORC Note:;2018-07-11 01:20:00;10 seconds;1 bright red orb Came out to my back patio and looked up at the stars as I often do because I live in the country.  I saw a bright red orb traveling west to east, went back inside to get my binoculars and when I came back out it was gone.   It must have picked up speed greatly.  Because during the 5-10 seconds I was observing it the speed was constant.  It took me probably 5 seconds to get my binoculars off the keyrack and I have a wide view range of the sky it is a clear night, so it must have increased its speed tremendously, in the time it took me to open my back door and grab my binoculars.   I don't think it was the ISS as it was on the other side of the planet at that time.;40.2937999999997;-83.0743999999998
Green ball of light;2019-12-13 02:30:00;2 seconds;Green ball of light Green light that came straight down to what looked like the ground. It lit up the sky around it, was definitely not a shooting star. Never seen anything like it.;40.2937999999997;-83.0743999999998
White lights moving in an erratic hovering pattern that no aircraft could achive;2020-10-06 20:15:00;7 minutes;White lights moving in an erratic hovering pattern that no aircraft could achive Was outside at the time of observance. Local hospital is nearby, local life flight helicopter was coming in low to ground at the hospital. Life flight circled back for a second pass for some reason, and when the helicopter passed slowly over us to double back to the landing pad, the lights suddenly appeared.  At first, there was just one light and then the others sprang off of it one at a time until there was a total of five individual lights hovering. They were white, like stars. The lights then proceeded to hover independently in multiple directions as they spread out. They were so high in the atmosphere that they resembled the stars and they moved erratically and very fast. They would come together and move away from each other in lightning fast speeds with a pattern of hovering and moving in smaller circles. Another witness and I observed these UFO’s for a duration of five minutes.  The helicopter finally landed at the hospital and the lights disappeared when it did. They disappeared just as fast as the appeared, as if out of thin air. The disappearance also happened in unison. They zipped away at the fastest speeds that no aircraft can achieve and was gone. Video evidence was also filmed at this event, if needed.;40.2937999999997;-83.0743999999998
