Red/orange sphere hovering over Delaware, Ohio.;2015-07-24 23:00:00;5 minutes;Red/orange sphere hovering over Delaware, Ohio. My husband and I were just arriving home around 11pm, and we noticed a red orange sphere in the sky.  It appeared stationary and then moved slowly towards us.  It then stopped again, and changed color from red to orange.  It then dimmed down to a white light then became bright again and then blinked out completely.  There was no sound.  There were no tail lights or trail left from it.  I would estimate the object to have been at around 10,000 feet.   It was a very clear night not a cloud in the sky.  We both found it strange that it just blinked out and disappeared.  We had a good view and would have seen it, if it just flew off.
