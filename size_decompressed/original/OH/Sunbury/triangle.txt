Large, red triangle over Delaware County.;2003-08-25 04:45:00;15 MIN;Large, red triangle over Delaware County. As I was driving to work this morning I happened to look over my left shoulder across an empty field and saw a large red triangle, approximately two miles northeast of my location.  I had made a left from Wilson Rd. onto Berkshire Rd. and happened to glance out the drivers side window. The triangular shape was distinct. The edges of the object were illuminated by a red band of individual lights. The lights did not flash. The object appeared to be either hovering or making a slow movement to the southwest in my direction. It was probably 15 degrees above the horizon.  I considered stopping for a better look, or making a call to the sheriff or a radio station, but I did not have time.  As I was driving to work on Interstate 71, I tried to locate the object, but I could not see it.  The weird thing was that when I pulled into the parking lot at work (in the Polaris area of Columbus) at about 5:00 AM, I again saw the same triangle in the eastern sky, this time at a much higher elevation, probably 45 degrees above the horizon. It was probably four miles to the east. After looking at it for a few seconds, it seemed to fade away into the night sky.  When I got into my car at 4:40 AM, I saw nothing unusual. But the distance at which I saw it would have put it very near my house.  I am hoping that there are other eyewitnesses.;40.2645000000001;-82.8503999999997
Low, slow, silent delta shaped flyer over Sunbury, Ohio.;2015-01-14 22:30:00;5 minutes;Low, slow, silent delta shaped flyer over Sunbury, Ohio. I don’t think this was extraterrestrial but unlike any thing I’ve seen.  I was driving into town from the southeast on SR 37 on my way through town.  I noticed a very bright light, very low.   As I was driving it first looked like it was still.  I didn’t remember a cell tower in that area or any lights on the top of the courthouse so I took notice.  It was low enough that I lost sight of it through the trees and buildings and flying slow enough, I thought it could be a helicopter. By the time I reached the top of the hill continuing into town, it was slowly flying directly along SR 37, which is the main street of town.  I pulled over as soon as I could and stepped out of the car to get a better look.  This thing had come right across the middle of the village on a straight course from as far as I cold see it and exited the same way.  It flew directly over me.  It was a hundred to maybe two hundred feet above the ground and very quiet.  I expected it to be an airplane and be very loud but it was nearly, if not, silent. We sometimes see military helicopters from Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio, coming or going, usually in formation, but nothing like this. Again, I don’t think it was ET because it had the usual marking lights but the Delta shape, silence and, altitude was strange.  We see Jets flying in low preparing to land at Port Columbus Intl Airport, never this low never this quiet and this was not heading that direction.;40.2645000000001;-82.8503999999997
