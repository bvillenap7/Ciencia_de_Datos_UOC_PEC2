It was a disc shaped aircraft. It had a dome shaped center with the dome smaller at the bottom.  It had two white position lights equal distance apart on the disc. It had red lights that moved but they moved verticaly from what appeared to be the top center to the bottom.  After viewing through binoculars I could see the red lights were slightly off center. The craft had what appeared to be windows in the domed center and there were lights on inside the craft.  I could not make anything out inside the craft. Although barely audible I could hear a faint humming sound.  The craft was moving slow and at times hovered for long periods of time over one spot.  It moved towards the direction I was standing but then started moving sideways instead of forward. The area this took place was in the country over a field of soy beans.;40.2645000000001;-82.8503999999997
