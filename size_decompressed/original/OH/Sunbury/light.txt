Observed unusual red/white/ and yellow light source in the western sky;2003-06-06 22:45:00;20 Seconds;Observed unusual red/white/ and yellow light source in the western sky Observed red, white, and yellow flashing light in western sky.  I was watching TV at approximately 10:45 p.m. I was facing toward the west, in the direction of a door with a large window facing my deck in a westerly direction.  Out of the corner of my eye, I observed what appeared to be an object in the sky that was simultaneously flashing a red and white light. It also appeared to flash yellow as well. I immediately checked to make sure that this was not a reflection off of the glass from an inside source.  I moved closer to the window and affirmed that is was indeed an object in the sky. It remained completely stationary, but it continued to flash a red, white, and yellow light on and off at the same time. The object was about 45 degrees above the horizon. I would estimate that it was approximately 4-5 miles WNW of my location. It was smaller than a dime at arms length, but definitely noticeable. It had no definite shape.  Anyone driving on Interstate 71 should have been able to see the object since I-71 is 2 miles west of my location in a semi-rural area.  In a period of 3 seconds, the object appeared to fade away, leaving only the darkness of the sky in its wake.  I do recall audibly hearing other small Cessna aircraft in the vicinity after the sighting that night, but this object was far brighter than any other conventional aircraft that I have seen in the night sky. I felt strongly enough about the sighting to report it.  I would like to add that I am a regular visitor to your site. I think that NUFORC has done a tremendous job with limited resources. The American public deserves an independent source to report unusual activity in the skies for scientific, public interest, and public safety issues.  Thank You.;40.2645000000001;-82.8503999999997
