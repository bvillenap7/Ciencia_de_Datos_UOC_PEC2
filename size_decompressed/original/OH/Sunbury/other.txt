My cousin and I were walking around our campground at night when I looked up too see a large aircraft directly above my head.  It stretched very long, from about the visible length of star Vega to Altair.  It was a very long and skinny spacecraft with hundreds of small lights at the bottom that moved very slowly across the sky and turned largely, the way a boat would, before disappearing.  Hundreds of lights seemed to all move and one glowed brighter suddenly in the center before dimming back to the same level as the others.  It was the most amazing thing Iâ€™ve ever seen.;40.2645000000001;-82.8503999999997
