I was driving with my wife on our way back from a home we are renovating.  When we approached town we noticed 3 round orange lights in a horizontal row hovering above a radio tower (height not known).  Maybe 30 seconds of us seeing them they disappeared one by one from left to right.  We are positive it was not an aircraft.  They were not moving forward, just hovering slightly up and down.  I do not believe in UFO's completely so take this information as true and correct.  I witnessed a couple of other cars further on my drive parked by the road, out of the auto viewing the phenomenom.;38.8922;-82.5946
