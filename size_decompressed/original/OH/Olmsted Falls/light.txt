At 21:50 on 7/4/11 I was leaving my father's home in Olmsted Falls, Ohio.  After loading my car, we stood in his driveway and watched fireworks. At 22:00 we were talking and turned to face northeast (two o' clock) in the direction of I-480 and North Olmsted Golf Club.  Both of us saw a formation of six orange-colored, oval-shaped lights moving in line (from two o' clock to nine o' clock) toward our location. I commented: I don't think those are fireworks.  My father was in the miliary and has flown aircraft. He stated: They must be military transport choppers!  He added: But it's not exactly safe conditions to be flying tonight.   At 22:01 three neighbors from down the street had been watching fireworks (southwest) and approached, one woman asking my father (due to his knowledge of aircraft) What kind of planes are those?  He told her he was uncertain. The six orange lights flew in two wide triangular formations that stretched and contracted, narrowing as they passed over us.  The lights were solid, exhibiting no blinking or pulsing.  The lights made no sound, and my father remarked that you can't hear the rotors.  The lights paused at times, ascended and descended. He asked me to photograph them with my Droid.  I attempted to first record video and second snap pictures.  I got two of them, but only caught one light in the picture. At 22:01, after they passed over my father's house, the lights receded into the distance for a few seconds and then vanished.  A fourth neighbor/witness remarked that these may have been balloons.  The lights did not return.;41.3747;-81.9132
