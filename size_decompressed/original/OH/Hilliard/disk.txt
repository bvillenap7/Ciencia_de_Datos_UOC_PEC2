UFO went overhead at a high rate of speed and continued north-northwest.;2002-04-18 20:30:00;0:45;UFO went overhead at a high rate of speed and continued north-northwest. The objectrose from behind a house as we were facing the north and we thought it was a helium ballon then my wife said do helium balloons rise that fast? and I told her that I thought that it must be a fresh ballon and right after I said that it appeared to move overhead and continued to do so until it was over head following a very linear path towards the north-northwest and I watched it until it went out of site the entire episode lasted for aprox. 45-60 seconds.;40.0337;-83.1318999999981
