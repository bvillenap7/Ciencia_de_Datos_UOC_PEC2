((HOAX??))  the of us had seen it on the right side above a neighbor's house.  ((anonymous report));2016-08-23 10:30:00;30;As I was driving back home from picking up food this evening, the the of us had seen it on the right side above a neighbor's house. It was as if I was driving in slow motion. This is not the first time seeing an UFO. It's been throughout my entire life time. My father has seen etc.  I guess it's a family thing. I've had many experiences with them. I have seen many UFO's here in Ohio, along with others t been with more.  As if it's watching us.
