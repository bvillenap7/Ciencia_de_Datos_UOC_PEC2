Was looking up at stars when suddenly I saw only a rectangle of green lights, with some black markings or lines intertwined, appear for no more than 3 seconds before it disappeared. It was heading S to N, did not see any shape below or above the lights. It was moving at a constant, fast speed. No clouds at location of sighting, clear sky. As soon as I saw it, it pretty much disappeared. Almost seemed like something was camouflaged, and then they turned the lights on for a few seconds, while the outer ship was still camouflaged, then turned lights off. Was below the height of airplanes taking off or landing, and silent. Living where I do, the city airport isn't far off and planes take off and land all day, but you always hear them, and see a trail. This thing was flying at a perfect Right to left motion, not going up or down for at least the few seconds I saw it. The crafts light was solid luminescent green, was not flickering ! or blinking like airplanes do. From my viewpoint, the rectangle of lights was about an inch long if I held my fingers up to measure. Not sure what the actual size of it would be up close, likely several yards at least. Not sure what I saw, but it certainly wasn't an plane, helicopter, drone, or anything I can think of. Stayed out for 10 more minutes going in and out of house getting ready for jog, but didn't see it again. Didn't know where to report it, so hope others saw what I did!;40.0337;-83.1318999999981
