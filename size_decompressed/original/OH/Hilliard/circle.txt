When I looked up it looked like an alinement of planets in a galaxy of how straight they were. It looked like it was gonna be the end of the world. The lights would blink and than one half of the lights would turn off than turn on than the other half would do ye same and than the lights would slowly go away one by one after about 7-10 minutes. You could see a big circle shaped ship behind the lights. It would rotate clockwise but the one main beige red light wouldnâ€™t move position but you could tell it was rotating.;40.0337;-83.1318999999981
