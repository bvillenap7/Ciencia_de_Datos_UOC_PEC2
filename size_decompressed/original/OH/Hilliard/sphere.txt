Brilliant reddish-orange sphere with white flame near Columbus, Ohio.;2011-10-08 21:35:00;30 seconds;Brilliant reddish-orange sphere with white flame near Columbus, Ohio. While driving I-70 headed west I saw a very bright glowing sphere with a flickering white light. At first I thought it might be a helicopter with the interior lit a bright orange-red or gold-copper color.   From my position I viewed it initially at a 45 degree SSW to where I lost sight at approximately 80 degrees S.  It came in our direction and slowly descended, although it did not descend much. As it approached the white flickering light appeared instead to be a flame. The object was not a hot air balloon, though, as the light was in front of the bright sphere, not beneath it.   I could tell also that the object clearly was not a helicopter.   I tried to get my passenger to look at it, but by the time he looked up the view of the sphere was obscured by the roof of my car.   There were planes in the distance, but none near me.   Even after opening my window I heard no sounds which would have been from a flying craft.   I have never seen such a brilliantly glowing reddish-orange sphere before. It looked large, but as I had no real frame of reference, I cannot say the actual size. ;40.0337;-83.1318999999981
