Four orange/yellow lights appear, disappear in night sky.;2007-10-07 00:10:00;Approx 5 minutes;Four orange/yellow lights appear, disappear in night sky. Four bright, orange/yellow balls of light formed an almost incomplete triangle-three diagonally up in a north-northeast direction, and the fourth below the very top light in the diagonal. I was driving, so as I pulled into the parking lot of the high school, the fourth, bottom light went out. While I watched from my car in the parking lot, the three remaining lights began to move in their diagonal, a north-northeast direction. In succession, the lights would slowly fade, as they each reached the same point. The first would fade, when the second got to the same point, it would fade, same with the third. I was the only one in my car, but I did notice two high school aged girls on the sidewalk by the parking lot, observing this phenomena. The event lasted no longer than 5 minutes, I would assume. I did not see the lights appear in the night sky, but at first, had mistaken them for a possibly really low Big Dipper. The lights were possibly 150-200 feet higher than the two story building, and were not visible from my car through trees.;40.0337;-83.1318999999981

White Light in the Sky;2019-10-09 07:00:00;1-3 seconds;White Light in the Sky I was standing outside facing the north and I saw a flash of white light in the east and it traveled west and then went back towards the east.  The sun was rising but the sky was still black in west.  It was light enough out at that point that you couldn't see any stars in the sky.;40.0337;-83.1318999999981
Orange flickering lights meandering in and out of formation.;2020-07-04 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;Orange flickering lights meandering in and out of formation. This is the 3rd time I have seen these lights around Columbus, OH. On July 4, 2020, shortly before 10:00pm my wife and I noticed several orange glowing/flickering lights in the distance. We live in Hilliard (city just outside Columbus) and noticed these lights in the southern sky above the horizon. I assume they were several miles away (maybe coming from around Grove City). We initially saw 2 during the fireworks everyone was setting off. We then saw a few more lights join (looked almost like they were taking off from somewhere in the distance). I can say for certain they were not helicopters or drones. They moved unlike anything I have seen (aside from the other 2 times I saw these lights), kind of moving in and out of a triangular formation or just meandering.Â  Occasionally, 1 or 2 would flicker and disappear, only to reappear a few seconds later. In total, we saw about 7-9. My wife got a brief video on her phone but was a little shaken up and went back in! side. I know drones can move around in different directions, but these would have had to have had very bright lights (a little brighter than Jupiter in the night sky). Also, they eventually went up into the sky and disappeared. I have seen videos on youtube of these same kind of lights in Cincinnati.;40.0337;-83.1318999999981
