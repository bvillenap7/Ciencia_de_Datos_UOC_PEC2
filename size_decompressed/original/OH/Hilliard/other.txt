((HOAX??))  About 1-2 weeks ago and I kept seeing this white huge orb going across our yard.  ((anonymous report));2016-08-14 10:30:00;30 seconds 5/6x;I and a family member was outside during today about 1-2 weeks ago, and I kept seeing this white huge orb going across our yard, then by the shed, then by the barn and then then behind the trash cans. I had asked her if she seen it and she replied Nope.  So I had seen it for a few day's as I would be outside and then  few day's ago, she had said to me remember when you kept seeing that white thing?  I said yes, why?  She said she did actually see it as well. Last week it was raining and a bit of lighting as well.  The family was getting ready to eat dinner, I got up walked to the restroom, and something told me to look outside, so I did and I had seen this blue light like a lightning bolt but when it looked like it has touched down, there was light bouncing off the ground as if it were like a rain drop.  And I had felt a very calming, safe, loved feeling and then for some of rain I thought to myself he's here. Now I have no clue what the back I talking about.  So I shut the curtains and walked over to use the restroom and then my family member came and said the power is out. I just replied okay, I know.  But there was a calmness in our house as to whet moments before three was some bitterness at the table. Has anybody witnessed this event last woeful in Hilliard off David rd?. Ever since' I've had a sound in my ears ever since. Ever since our dog has been barking and nothing would be there.
