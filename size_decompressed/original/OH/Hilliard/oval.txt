We witnessed a bright light at inconceivable speeds.;2011-07-27 01:00:00;Less than a second;We witnessed a bright light at inconceivable speeds. With an increasing amount of aircraft and chem-trails in our area, my wife and I have been led to look skyward.  After noticing an extremely bright and loud craft moving east to west we decided to pay more attention.  Facing North, we took sight of a couple planes traveling at an average pace.  While watching the common crafts a burst of light took grasp of the Northern cloudscape. In motion this hot white light traveled at a speed many times greater than any earthly craft  I have been made aware.   While using the distance and speed of the other craft as a reference it was made obvious to me the U.F.O. was far greater in altitude and speed, yet was much clearer and brighter than any other the skies occupants.  This object went from a large cloud to directly behind a smaller tailing cloud before disappearing behind it.  It consisted of a huge explosion of propulsion, which emanated enough hot white light to allow me to make out a slight curve in the structure.  The e! ntire encounter lasted only a fraction of a second and produced no noticeable sound. Later that morning near an odd triangle constellation my wife and I noticed similar activity at a much higher altitude.;40.0337;-83.1318999999981
Six red/orange color lights.;2012-07-27 22:30:00;2 minutes;Six red/orange color lights I saw 6 lights in the sky that were a red/orange color.  They were in a straight line and were an equal distance from each other moving at the same speed.   They weren't traveling very fast.  I watched them for about 1:30 to 2 minutes before they were out of my sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
