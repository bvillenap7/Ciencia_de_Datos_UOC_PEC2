We were talking about getting some pizza when she said, Oh my god, what are those?!  They're glowing!   I thought she was pointing at the fireflies flying accross the road, so thats what i said, Fireflies.   She sounded scared when she said, No! In the sky!    I looked up and almost drove off the road as i gazed at the two orange glowing balls of flames folating up and down in the sky.  They looked four times as big as a normal sized star at night time. (There were no stars out at this time.)   She says, Could they be hot air ballons?  First off i thought...  Its 11:00PM, what kinda ballons would be out this late.  We drove DIRECTLY under them.   My girlfriend stuck her head out the window and could still see them.   If they were hot air ballons, the basket would have covered up the flame.  Also, we saw no sign of a balloon above the flame.   I took a hard left turn into the Hilliard Darby High School parking lot so i could get out of my truck.  My girlfriend started praying as i stared the objects in the sky.  Looking into the sky, if you put your fist in between the two balls, thats how far apart they were.  I took a 15 second video of it on my phone.  I could see the Orbs on my phone as i recorded, but when i went to watch it the next day, all i saw was a 15 second clip of the black sky.   After i took the video, i called my dad to give the UFO sighting number.  When he did, i called and left a message on the answering mechine.;40.0337;-83.1318999999981
Low flying silent fireball.  Thought it was a plane on fire.;2013-09-23 20:00:00;3 minutes;Low flying silent fireball.  Thought it was a plane on fire. Orange fireball seemed to appear out of nowhere.  We are below a flight path so we thought it was a plane that was on fire.  It was very bright orange with what looked like flames engulfing the rear of the object.  It was flying very low and there was NO sound whatsoever, which is strange because I have heard sounds from planes flying a lot higher than it was.   It flew in a straight line until it disappeared into the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know whether the witness implies a morning, or evening, sighting.  We suspect the latter, but we cannot be certain.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.0337;-83.1318999999981
