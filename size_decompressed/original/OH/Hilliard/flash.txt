Just giving you a time and palce so you can track it's speed. Was driving west bound on Palamos Drive in my condo comlex when I noticed flashing light in the sky to my right. I looked due North and saw what I thoguth was a firework, but it was racing level across the horizon with no arch. It was flashy, liek it was burning in the atmosphere, and was white and blue in color.  It appeared to be very close, such as in the neighborhood, btu uipoin hearig mroe reports on the lcoal news (inlcuding Jim Ganahl, a WCMH weatehr man) I realized it was further north of me than I orignally thought. I saw it absolutely no earlier than 19:04 and absolutely no later than 19:08.;40.0337;-83.1318999999981
