Incredibly bright light, faded in then out, maybe super nova.;2001-08-13 22:31:00;30 seconds;Incredibly bright light, faded in then out, maybe super nova. I'm only guessing at the date and time, it was definitely a couple of weeks before 9/11 and I saw a sighting in your database, in Ohio, similar to mine so I'm entering this as the date and time. My husband and I went fishing for catfish after dark at a local public lake. It was a cloudless night. We had a Coleman lantern and I was watching the end of my rod looking for twitches that would mean I had a fish on. I suddenly noticed a light reflected in the water and I looked up to see a bright star that was rapidly getting brighter. I yelled to my husband who wasn't fishing and hadn't yet noticed it. For a second I thought it was a meteorite heading dead on for us as there was no movement at all. I was convinced for just a moment that we were going to get hit and die by meteorite! Then I noticed there were no sparks like I've seen in other fireballs I've witnessed and I next decided it must be a super nova. It got so bright it almost hurt my eyes, it lit up the woods around us, even brighter than a full moon would. It then started to dim at the same speed that it brightened and eventually faded away to nothing. It seemed to take a long time, but I'd guess it was actually around 30 seconds in duration. If I remember correctly, I think I heard something reported on the local news a few days later involving a bright light or a super nova, but I'm not sure. I have since seen aerial flares on TV and though they are similar to what I saw, flares actually have a floating feeling about them and they last much longer than my light. My light didn't float, it definitely seemed to be outside earth's atmosphere.;39.7184000000005;-82.6073000000011
A red/pink pulsing object performing strange flight patterns.;2004-06-23 03:00:00;2 Minutes;A red/pink pulsing object performing strange flight patterns. On the morning of June 23, my girlfriend and I were heading up Rt. 33 North in Southern Central Ohio, about two or three miles south of Lancaster. She was the first one to notice the object, then myself. It was just a speckle of light in the sky, starting off as a pinkish light then pulsing to red. The object would have appeared like a normal aircraft, except that this one slowed down to almost a stop then sped up again. We watched it for maybe 20-30 Seconds before it abruptly disappeared.;39.7184000000005;-82.6073000000011
Very bright lights moving at various speeds.;2016-06-15 23:00:00;12 minutes;Very bright lights moving at various speeds. Me and my friend were driving towards lancaster when we both saw a very bright light hovering  just above the tree line.  The light was very bright, brighter than anything ive ever seen in the sky.  The object was also very large.   When we got to Lancaster the light was hovering lower than before near mcdonalds.  We slammed on the brakes and turned around, then the light darted away extremely fast.  We then drove in the direction of the light and saw it in the distance.   The closer we got to it the further away the light seemed to be.  We then lost the object over near walmart;39.7184000000005;-82.6073000000011

small red light, followed by large white light;2021-01-20 19:00:00;~1 minute;small red light, followed by large white light I was taking my dog out to go potty when I glanced up at the sky to admire the constellation Orion and saw a small reddish light moving southwest. Due to its apparent altitude, I assumed it was the International Space Station, so I excitedly pulled up the stargazing app on my phone to confirm my suspicion. When the app failed to identify the light, I watched it until it disappeared over the treeline, trying to figure out what it was. After it vanished from sight, I took my dog into the backyard to do her business, and was surprised to see another light â€”  this one much larger than the first, bright white, and moving northeast. I looked for the flashing red and green lights that would identify the light as a helicopter or airplane, but nothing. I also heard no sound. I pulled up my trusty stargazing app again to see if THIS was the ISS, but it was not. Thinking quickly, I pulled up the camera on my phone and filmed the light until it, too, vanished behind the! treeline. This second object was in view for maybe 30 seconds, and the whole encounter was maybe shortly over a minute. My dog did not respond to either object, but to be fair, she was busy.;39.7184000000005;-82.6073000000011
