While driving along state route 188, we witnessed an amber light in the western sky, apon stopping several miles down the road, we viewed the object through both a pair of binoculars and video camera. To The plain eye, the object looked like an amber star, however, through the camera we could see the object was a cigar shaped object through a 50X zoom. For several minutes, about ten degrees above the horizon, we watched the object slowly turn from a amber color to a deep red. Slowly, the object became very dark and disappeared over the horizon, behind some trees.;39.7184000000005;-82.6073000000011
Daytime sighting of cigar shaped object, Lancaster, Ohio.;2013-10-08 16:00:00;3-5 minutes;daytime sighting of cigar shaped object, Lancaster Ohio Two friends and I were enjoying a beautiful clear day at Greenfield Lake just outside of Lancaster Ohio when we noticed a metallic, cigar shaped object in the northeast moving slowly to the southwest.   There were no wings or markings of any kind and no exhaust trail.  We observed this for several minutes,awe struck, without thinking that we all had cameras on our cell phones.  I was able to snap seven pictures of the object before it disappeared behind the trees.  The pictures are of poor quality and do not do justice to what we witnessed.;39.7184000000005;-82.6073000000011
