The sun was just starting to go down and we were sitting on my living room floor playing a video game. The t.v is on the floor and there is a window right above the t.v. the curtain to the window was wide open and we had a full view of the sky from where we was sitting. As I noticed the large craft flying very low, I would guess about 10 stories up, my nephew says Wow! and I immediately knew what he was saying wow for as I was thinking the same thing. We both saw a very large triangle shaped craft, it was very bright we could see the bottom of the craft as it was flying away from us, it had flown right over our house! I mean directly over top of our house. It had several brightly colored lights on the bottom and it was the size of a jet liner. I would think that I would have herd the craft but I didn't hear anything. If a plane would have been flying over head at that altitude it would have shook the house with the force of a hurricane. I didn't hear nothing, didn't feel nothing, and if we had not seen it I would have never even knew it was there. It was as if it was just gliding along. This did not scare me at all.  I wouldn't mind knowing! what it was, I figure it is some kind of military craft that no one knows of.  My nephew seems to think it was definitely from out of this world.  Whatever it was, it was real and I saw it.;39.7184000000005;-82.6073000000011
