Large fireball in the sky to the left of the sun, seemed to changed it's shape, and size.;2016-01-24 16:45:00;5 minutes;Large fireball in the sky to the left of the sun, seemed to changed it's shape, and size. On January 24, 2016, my mother and I were heading west on Fair Ave. when I noticed a single fireball in the sky.  It was glowing orange but seemed to have changed its shape from a standard orb, to a multi-dimensional object.  I followed the fireball for nearly 5 minutes, however it did not seem to be moving.   I took several photos to which you can clearly see the much larger and brighter sun in the sky to the right of the fireball.  I was only able to see it while traveling on Fair Ave in the 5 minutes time frame I mentioned.   It was very unusual and a little scary.;39.7184000000005;-82.6073000000011
