Bright, Nonflashing Pinkish Light without any accompanying lights visible.;2008-08-07 23:46:00;2 minutes;Bright, Nonflashing Pinkish Light without any accompanying lights visible. Observed a pinkish, large, moderately bright light, non-blinking and unchanging, moving toward my location where I stood observing.  The movement was not unlike an aircraft, straightline and not apparently faster than a conventional plane.  No sound.  What made this unlike anything I have seen before was the color (pink grapefruit flesh colored).  The conditions were very clear, star-filled sky with no lunar illumination (very dark sky and brilliant starlight--no haze or humidity).  The object was moving almost directly in an Easterly path, at a height that appeared to be 800 ft or less. I tried to go in the house, upstairs, and locate the object as it passed over a tree that was about to block my view from the backyard, but I never saw it again, even after returning to the yard. It was a bit fuzzy around the edges, as if it were a fire (almost reminded me of what a flare should look like).  No smoke visible.  No other aircraft visible at this time in the sky around the object.  I am providing this report only as a confirmation in the event others report the same or similar observations.
