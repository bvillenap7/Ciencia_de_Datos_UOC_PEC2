There were no blinking lights on it. It made no noise , and left no tail I can't tell how big it was, but it was over MT. Pleasant in Lancaster Ohio , and looked to be about the size of a basketball. I lived about 1 mile from the Mountain. So this could have been VERY big. This has been bothering  me for almost 20 years , and is tho only time I ever saw a u.f.O  If it was a meteorite , I would have thought it wouldhave left a tail , or changed color as the different meteals burned off.  The only other person who saw this was my best friend at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  We do not know what the witness means by 27:00 hours.

A Bright light in the shape of a sphere that moved southeast at a steady spead and appeared to have flames pulsating behind it.;2001-02-08 20:00:00;1.25 minutes;A Bright light in the shape of a sphere that moved southeast at a steady spead and appeared to have flames pulsating behind it. The object was a sphere shaped light(very bright). It was about 1000-2000 feet high and moved southeast at a fast but steady pace. As it got closer it appeared to have Yellow and red flames coming out the back. I filmed the object with a 50x zoom video camcorder and zoomed all the way to the object and it was multi colored broken up into little cells. At a farther away view it seemed silvery metallic colored and was as if the moon was reflecting off of it.  The object blinked what seemed to be 3 red lights once and then it was gone.;39.7184000000005;-82.6073000000011
ABOUT TWO HOURS BEFORE SUNSET, I LOOKED STRAIGHT UP AND SAW TWO VERY BRIGHT SILVER BB OBJECTS THAT WERE MUCH HIGHER THAN JET AIRCRAFT T;2008-04-06 18:00:00;ONE MINUTE;ABOUT TWO HOURS BEFORE SUNSET, I LOOKED STRAIGHT UP AND SAW TWO VERY BRIGHT SILVER BB OBJECTS THAT WERE MUCH HIGHER THAN JET AIRCRAFT THAT WERE LEAVING A CONTRAIL. THE TWO OBJECTS LEFT NO CONTRAIL AND WERE MOVING ABOUT 300 DEGREES AND APEARED TO HOOVER IN MID FLIGHT TO THE NORTH WEST OF LANCASTER OHIO..I WATCH SATALITES ALL THE TIME AND HAVE NOT SEEN ONE HOOVER YET. THEY DISAPEARED DUE TO DISTANCE AND ALTITUDE. ALSO, WHILE WATCHING SATALITES AND STARS ONE NIGHT, I SAW A WHITE PULSE BEHIND AN VERY FAST MOVING OBJECT AT THE ALTITUDE OF SATALITES AND IT MOVED ABOUT 30TIMES FASTER THAN ORBITING SATILITES. IT FLEW FROM THE NORTH STAR DOWN SOUTH AND THEN WENT IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AS IF TO SAY LOOK AT ME... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
