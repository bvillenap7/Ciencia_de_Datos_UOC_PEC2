((HOAX??)) White lights in saucer like pattern.  ((anonymous report));2016-06-15 23:00:00;10 minutes;White lights in saiucer like pattern Me and a buddy were just cruising along and happend to look up and see a strange display of unusually bright lights,  The formation was larger than any plane  I've seen.  It was made of super bright white lights in a curved shape with another smaller curve on top, sort of like a saucer.   It was first noticed above a red cellular tower and then it appeard to tilt over and began to fly down the street so we followed it.  Then it began moving incredibly fast unlike anything possible by human technology.  It vanished into thick trees.   After driving as fast as possible down of few roads we thought it might have went we spotted it moving slowly over Arlington avenue then it stopped and tilted back up but only a few seconds later and took off and almost in an instant it tipped over and zipped off into the horizon in the area by Walmart and mernards before vanishing.   During the whole thing it changed speeds and the way it was moving.  It was somewhat erratic and incredibly! huge, the size of a building almost a saucer shape.  Not any flashes but made of a bunch of lights and it seemed to change intensity slightly.   Most incredible thing I've ever witnessed.  Hope more than me and my buddy saw it.
