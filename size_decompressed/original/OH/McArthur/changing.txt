A friend called me to tell me about a pecullier object in the sky over McArthur Ohio.  I left within a few minutes to look for it my self.  As I came upon a clearing I looked around and then saw it my self.  I saw an object hanging in the sky.  It was about a mile up in the sky.   I could observe a bright object with a slight discernable shape slowly drifting to the east over the town of McArthur. My friend in the other part of the town was observing the the same object with some family members. When she originally saw it she said it alternated between a disc shape to that of a boomerang and had a yellowish smoky brown type aura around it.  Sighting lasted for about a half hour to 45 minutes. Originally spotted by ((name deleted)) of McArthur and witnessed by ((three more names deleted)) all of McArthur. And ((name 5 deleted)) of Plaistow New Hampshire at a different location in McArthur.;39.2802;-82.478
