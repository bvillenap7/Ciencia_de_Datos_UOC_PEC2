I am a teacher and I went outside my house to see if I could get a view of Mars.  I noticed what I first thought was a flashing star, but then I saw it was moving across the sky from the west to the east.While watching that one I began to see others like it moving from the west to the east, but then after about 20 minutes a few of them moved back from the east to the west.  At this point I called my mother and cousin who drove over.  I meanwhile also got my binoculars out and went back outside to get a closer look.  Then I noticed higher up in the sky 2 stationary circular blinking objets.  As I caught sight of the traveling ones again I could now see that they were reddish flashing lights and they had a triangular shape.  Mostly they traveled in one direction but a few times they zigzagged across the sky.  By 10:45p.m. we came inside so I am not sure how much longer they were out there.;41.5213;-82.7784
