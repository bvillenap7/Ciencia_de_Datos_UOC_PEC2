On or about May 1, 2002 on a clear night just when the stars come out a bright light in the sky caught my eye.  I went out my front door and stood on the porch.  I thought it may be a satellite or a planet but the light seemed to bright for that.   I then went into my house to get my camera, I had figured since my eyes wern't so good I could get a better look with my zoom lens.  It was still there and looked as if  it was trying to hide amoung the stars. I only took one picture not thinking it was a UFO and all it looked like was just a bright light in the sky.  I then dismissed the whole incident until I recieved the picture and negative back. I couldn't believe my eyes, the picture is just a saucer of light, not much definition but the negative showed what it was for sure in my eyes. It was saucer shaped, tilting slightly, enough that I could see a brighter light in the center, possibly pulsating to the edges and a shape more pie shaped.  This all happened in the northern sky and my beliefs are now confirmed.;41.6049;-83.5648
