Grey oval object with white lights rotating underneath. Object made no sound as it hoovered. Moved quickly;1973-07-15 21:00:00;3 to 5 mins;Grey oval object with white lights rotating underneath. Object made no sound as it hoovered. Moved quickly I was 17 years old in Cleveland Job Corps on Carnegie Ave. I don't remember which month it was - I was there from April to November. It was probably around June to August.  It was about 10pm one summer night when 6 or 7 girls came busting into my room running to the window.  They were very upset, talking about a space ship but I was laying in bed, reluctant to believe them.  When I got to the window.  I saw a grey looking oval shaped object.  From my view, we were looking underneath the ship.  There were square like boxes underneath that white lights were passing over.  We were on the 9th floor and I could see many girls in their windows looking at the ship and screaming and hollering.  The object just hoovered there for what seemed like eternity and then just moved quickly out of view. There was no sound from the ship.  We were so hysterical the director of Job Corps called a meeting in the middle of the night to calm us down.  There were 400 women in that building that night and at least 250 witnessed this ship.   This was not a blimp or airplane. Picture in your archive August, 1973 9:00 PM.Princeton,Indiana (USA)looks like the bottom except there was boxes of lights rotating underneath and I couldn't see what the top looked like.   Except for family, I have never discussed this because it is so scary to remember.  When I saw the picture in your archive I couldn't stop shaking and decided to share my long held secret.  I would be interested in talking to other Job Corpsmen that were there that night to see how they cope with this memory. It still scares me today, 32 years later.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
Oval aircraft with red and yellow lights;1980-07-20 21:00:00;4.00 min.;Oval aircraft with red and yellow lights My sister called me and my mother into the front yard to view a craft in the sky. It was oval shaped and white. It had yellow and red flashing lights around the outer edge. It hovered silently across the street from the house. Low in the sky and very visible. There were no windows or anything like an undercarriage. Absolutely no noise and for awhile no movement. Incidentally, across the street from the house was the TRW Valve Division. I usually suspect that often these crafts are not so much otherworldly as they are from a foreign country. Quite possibly this was a spycraft taking pictures of TRW as they manufactured defense components etc. Just my suspicion in this instance, as the craft was hovering above a factory right next to TRW. After approx. 4 minutes, it silently left at great speed in a southwest direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
On one normal morning...;1983-06-01 11:00:00;church;On one normal morning... Well, this is when my dad was young when he graduated from high school, one normal sunday morning he went to church with another witness which is his sister.  Well when church was over they were talking awhile outside, they were the last ones who were left at the church.  All of a sudden my aunt says look!!  Then they both went closer to a oval shaped figure. The figure in the air saw my dad and my aunt, so it went away. But my dad and my aunt still will never forget that day. The figure was a silverish brown color, my dad said to me that the figure was 123ft. away from them and 50ft. above the ground, when the figure was backing off, it made a flash and threw right into space.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

It moved in a zig-zag pattern and just disappeared and honestly I never believed in this however my husband has seen 2 UFO sightings in this area and I honestly thought he was nuts until tonight. I saw something that was way too fast to be human in any form. It really scared me.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
Silver object above Cleveland.;2013-05-31 08:30:00;5 seconds;Silver object above Cleveland I was driving east and looked out over the city (Cleveland). One silver, shiny object seemed to appear.  There were no clouds but it was slightly overcast or hazy.  The object did not seem to be moving much, maybe slowly toward the north.  There appeared to be a very bright spot on the object, maybe the sun’s reflection.  I looked at it for a few seconds and then looked back to the road (traffic was heavy).  I looked back up within 1 or two seconds and the object was gone.  No smoke or trail, just gone.  I continued to look for it but did not see it again.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

Huge oval craft over urban area;2019-12-01 06:25:00;5-6 minutes;Huge oval craft over urban area I was on my way to work around ^:10 am via bicycle in the morning of December 1st on Lakeview Road near Superior.  I stopped at a market to buy cigarettes.  I had to be at work by 7 am. WHen I came out of the store something caught my eye right above me.  I got on my bike heading north when I saw an oval craft that was bright orange and then turned white.  It was hovering about 200-300 feet above me.  It was bigger than airplane. Bigger than the Goodyear blimp. It didn’t make any noise. I didn’t feel any heat from it.  It “followed” me to work.  I even called my wife while it was happening.  I was scared.  It didn’t throw a light on me.  It was moving back and forth, right to left, swiftly and back again.  It would brighten and then darken.  I saw it do this about four times.  When I arrived near where I work it moved off heading north but the lights kept coming on and off.  I think it then headed east then toward Wickliffe.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
