Triangular craft over Burke Lakefront Airport Cleveland. White lights on the sides, red light shimmering in the middle-bottom.;2007-02-17 02:52:00;3 minutes;Triangular craft over Burke Lakefront Airport Cleveland. White lights on the sides, red light shimmering in the middle-bottom. while driving down I-90 west around dead man's curve, i noticed something different out of the corner of my eye, something bright.  i looked towards the airport and thought i saw extra lights from a plane.  i realized there was a new control tower, triangular, with different lights in the corners.  the lights on the edges were enormous in proportion to all the other lights nearby.  it was hovering DEAD STILL approximately 50-150ft above the runway.  when i realized it was not a tower, that it was suspended, i craned my head outside my window and almost crashed my car while looking. something told me to park the car and watch, but i didnt want to have the police pull me over.  i was not scared at all i watched it hover for about 3 minutes. as a test, i memorized the image in my head.  i took my eyes off of it for 45 seconds, in order to turn around on E55th street. i ran the light, flew around, and had full view of the entire runway within 10 seconds of entering the freeway (now I-90 east). there was NOTHING IN SIGHT.  in fact, the entire airport was now dark, whereas before it had been almost totally illuminated by searchlights.  i parked on the side of the road near the dolphins and got out of my car and searched tghe skies for a good 2 min in all direction. there was no sight of ANY lights in the sky. after i am finished with all the math calculations, i have figured out the object had to have traveled faster than 7,000- 14,000MPH in order for the object to be completely out of range.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

When checking my surroundings for the ambulance to yield to it I saw a very large object (much, much larger than any airplane) with an upside down triangle light pattern fly from northeast to southwest in the general vicinity of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport and the NASA Glenn Research Center.  The object was only a few hundred feet from the ground and was out of my sight after roughly five seconds.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
Triangular object with white cloudy fixed line triangular formation and bright shining prism light.;2012-05-13 15:00:00;6-7 minutes;Triangular object with white cloudy fixed line triangular formation and bright shining prism light. Sighted a stationary object well above lower puffy cloud line almost directly over head in the east. Clear blue sky back round.Distance was great very high in the sky, actually made it look small. Description of craft: Shape: Triangle. Composition: all 3 sides of the triangle looked like white cloudy field that held its straight line shape to form the triangle.  But the white cloudy field did have fluctuation and movement within itself like a shifting and re-arranging constant.  At the top where the two longest sides of the triangle met was a very bright round shinning prism of beaming light.  Craft stayed stationary but made movement in its one spot.  Oddly enough it was as if it was putting on a show.  The craft looked as though it was flipping (turning) slowly in a timed sequence over and over again.  Each time it would flip backwards away from me the prism light went out of sight then return once it was flipped toward me and back at the top of the triangle.   Also the white cloudy fields that made the triangle line configuration would slightly dissolve themselves but immediately return their shape and consistency while craft was in motion turning over a flipping over.  It seemed it was getting smaller  and farther away as the minutes passed.  It then slowly seemed to go to a range distance I could no longer view. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
3 red light triangle which broke into single lights then more red lights and a possible bigger craft.;2019-08-24 21:40:00;3 minutes;3 red light triangle which broke into single lights then more red lights and a possible bigger craft. Saturday, 8/24/19, 9:40pm EDT over the West Side of Cleveland.  I was sitting outside doing a fire pit in my back yard with one of my neighbors.  I'm in the West Park area of Cleveland, but almost in Brook Park, not far from Hopkins Airport.  My neighbor was sitting facing the right direction, ENE, to see it first. I was facing N.  She said, Hey, look at THAT, behind the trees!  There was a triangular formation of 3 steady solid red lights.  I'd guess ENE at about 55 degrees on the compass, and maybe 25-30 degrees above the ground.  I think the triangle was pointing down, with the 2 lights on top, and 1 below.  Was so excited, I don't remember for sure, but definitely was a triangle.  She can't recall either. The formation finally came over the trees, but was much higher up, going WSW about 250 degrees and seemed high in the sky.  They were completely silent.  Took maybe a minute or less to transverse the sky, I don't know how high up they were. I would say the triangle was the width of 2 full moons.  The formation broke up into the lights being side by side  after being just overhead, but a little to the north, and got dimmer and somewhat translucent as it went toward the WSW.  2 more red lights came from the ENE, side by side, and went the same way, then 2 more dimmer ones the same way.  Then my neighbor then said, Look, pointing slightly in the WSW direction, I couldn't see it. maybe my eyes couldn't adjust looking over the bright fire pit, but she said a round red light maybe 20X as big, she called it the mother ship but she said it was very dim and could hardly see it herself, with the other red lights surrounding it, all moving WSW and just faded as to the WSW she said.  I thought all the lights were faded and gone by the tine she seen the big dim one.  Looked to me on the ones I could see, they were going just maybe slightly north of Hopkins Airport and still high in the sky. The West Side and maybe downtown had to see it.  I tried video recording it on my phone, but my screen was pitch black, phone not good in the dark.  Later on I seen at one point I got 2 faint dots, what I assume were the top 2 lights, the bottom light must have been hidden by the trees.  That's all I got as nothing showing in my viewing screen to aim at as it was moving.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
