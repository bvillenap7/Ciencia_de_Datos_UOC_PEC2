I am also dumbfounded that my report on 11/17/98 of 4 orange eggs over Cleveland, Ohio, and a number of reports similar magically disappeared from data base.  This incident was also reported on local news media, and POOF....it's gone.  HHMMMMMM ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

And their was a note that said you wanted to contact anyone whom had seen it. Again, I was walking my dog, was facing south, and over my left shoulder caught a bright object. I turned and saw 4 very distinct egg shaped objects, equidistance to each other, travelling due east at an extremely high velocity. From the point I saw them they were at about 11:30 and were out of line sight about 3 sec. I have spent many nights watching the perseiddes and other showers, let me tell ya, this was'nt no meteor. They glowed a yellow orange and made no sound...I was awestruck. I have never seen anything like it before or since.
