Star-like objects change into triagle shaped craft in Slavic Village area, Cleveland;2002-03-04 22:00:00;10 minutes;Star-like objects change into triagle shaped craft in Slavic Village area, Cleveland About four months ago, I saw bright lights that seeme to form low on the horizon. These star-looking objects would then change into triangle-looking craft and move slowly up and to the south, gaining speed as they went. On that evening I must have seen at leat 20 of these form and move off. I often see strange craft in the are and star-looking objects in the shape of a triangle. i live in the North Broadway part of Cleveland ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Several changing shapes and colored objects traveling at fast speeds or just sitting there until they disapeared in the blink of an eye;2007-07-15 23:30:00;2 hours;Several changing shapes and colored objects traveling at fast speeds or just sitting there until they disapeared in the blink of an eye My friend and i were outside at night when we saw them. at the top of the tree horizon several objects started to appear and disapear. It looked like they had lights the shape of a triangle on the, then it would switch to circles, they were strobbing lights almost vilontly.  The objects were either sitting in place or jumping around in an almost zig zag.  Note: there were many airplanes in the sky at this time, it seemed almost as if they were supposed to be a distraction.  Two seperate times i saw a very fast blinking light, both times they disapeared after three blinks, the second time i saw one it didnt travel as far across the sky as the first one, but on the 3rd blink it was fading, then gone.  I have never seen a ufo in my life until last night, and i was almost scared because i saw so many of them on different areas of the sky but they were mainly near jupitor as it glows brightly.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
Red and Blue lights hovering over Cleveland's West side.  We saw it from the E side in Garfield.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2007-09-22 22:00:00;2 HOURS;Red and Blue lights hovering over Cleveland's West side.  We saw it from the East side in Garfield. Om September 22nd, 2007, at approximately 9:30 pm we spotted what first looked like an airplane in the northwestern sky over Cleveland, Ohio.  We were in Garfield Hts., Ohio at the time sitting on the back porch. 	We got a pair of binoculars to take a closer look.  It was not an airplane.  It was an unidentifiable object, actually hovering very slowly moving from the western sky towards the northwest. 	It first seemed to hover for at least an hour and finally started moving.  Through the binoculars, it first looked to me like an arrow or V shape with red, blue and white lights.  Then it changed to a circular shape with red lights on the left and blue lights on the right and white lights in the middle.  It was constantly blinking and twinkling.  My friend saw pretty much the same thing, but what she called concentrated energy force streaming from the blue and red lights.  She said it looked like a see-through bubble with white veins going around it.  She had contacts in, and I didnâ€™t.   After watching it for an hour and a half, it went further off into the horizon behind a tree.  It did not disappear suddenly, it just hovered away into the distance. ((NUFORC Note:  Star??
