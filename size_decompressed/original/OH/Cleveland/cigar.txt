I watched it for several minutes.  then instantly it shot off at a high rate of speed.  There was no sound.  At that point in time the electricity to the concert was momentary interupted.  Since we were several miles from airport, I was able to compare several differet shpes of planes seveal flying high.  All the planes I saw, I could make out the wings and the planes were leaving vaper trails.  The object I saw didn't have a vapor trail.  That's when I felt for sure it was a UFO.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
