I looked up to see what i considered balloons, im saying at least eight,they moved from straight over head to a large, very large! cloud.from over head to the clouds position would be 45 degrees, the children were screaming men in black repeatedly (it occurs to me now they didn't see it as balloons). as the spheres, or balls which were extremly white,  reached the cloud they seperated equally to each side and entered one by one. during this I held my hand up to this cloud that was at 45 degrees,and its width was wider than my hand at arms lenght the balls were the size of my fingernails. it made me consider that if one of those things were near us it would have been the size of our two car garage. then after realizing the balls seemed to pause and enter the cloud one by one, I found a different interest to see what would happen next. balloons I thought would act randomly so we all waited for them to exit the cloud at some time somewhere. we watched the cloud and followed it to the horizon (as far as we could possibly see  but they never emerged also the cloud seemed to have accelerated once the balls got inside it had an eastward heading. I'm only submitting this because I'm hoping someone seen something simular that i may compare.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
Bright white sphere;2006-05-23 23:30:00;6 seconds;Bright white sphere While letting dogs out before bed saw an extremely bright white 'star' like object. It was moving slowly in the west about 8000ft. It was in the flight path of two very high flying jets. Watched it moving WNW for about six seconds and it just flickered off like a light switch. Could not have been meteor, too slow. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

I noticed an intensely bright object about 45 degrees high that was so luminous it actually threw six light spikes from it. Their was a plane moving underneath opposite direction. Navigation lights noted. I watched this incredibly bright object for about 5 minutes and it was absolutely still. I finally blew it off as Venus or some star. But when I went to look again ten minutes later it was gone, poof. Not sure of what I saw but it was incredibly bright. From visual comparison to plane I would estimate object was nearly orbital and about the size of a pea at arms length. Just a sidenote. That afternoon the skies were absolutely covered in jet trails and military aircraft were seen in area. The trails were even on local tv news.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

It was about 8:00 or 9:00 because I remember it being about 30 minutes after the sun had set. I was walking to the porch when I happened to look up at the sky.  Normally we get a lot of airplane traffic above our house as the airport is about 15 miles away at most so I always look in the sky to see if there is anything out of the ordinary. I was looking up at the sky and walking onto the porch when I noticed an orange star. I went over the the north side of the porch which faces toward downtown and went to go look at the star again. I suddenly noticed this orange/red orange star was moving. It was very high in the sky, and very very light. It was moving straight and made no sound. All of a sudden it ballooned into three orange objects like when a firework explodes and rains down. The objects then made a 360 and at that point I thought they would hit each other and that they could be military aircraft. But they didn't and they seemed to be racing. But the further away they moved the harder it was to see them. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
