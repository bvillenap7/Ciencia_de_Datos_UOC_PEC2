Three lights spinning.;1995-10-15 20:00:00;10 minutes;This event was what made me and my brother know for sure there is life other than us in the galaxy. We were walking to the store and looked north, and what had to be 45° up, we saw three lights spinning slowly and it looked like one object but after about five or so minutes the lights moved away from each other and continued to spin that's when it changed from white light to soft orange.  If I had to guess I would say it was over the lake or the city and they never changed distance but I am confident we seen something being controlled by an intelligent race or it was human but I doubt it.   I don't care what people think I know what I saw I have never told anyone but me and my brother talk about it sometimes and it scares us both.

What made it different was its abiliy to change direction. It was moving quickly and had it been a satelite or something, it would go across the horizon in a straight manner.  This moved from due East to a South East direction.  It was very noticable and lasted +/- 10 minutes. 43 year old real estate developer w/2 children in private school.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

I CALLED OUT A FRIEND IN THE HOUSE BUT IT HAD HAPPEND TO QUICKLY!  CALLED MY BROTHER IN BOWLING GREEN, OH I WAS AMAIZED AT WHAT I HAD JUST WITNESSED. I WAS STANDING ON MY PORCH GETTING SOME FRESH AIR.  I USUALLY LOOK AT THE SKY LOOKING FOR ANY INTERESTING AIRPLANES OR HELECOPTERS FLYING NEARBY.  THE HOPKINS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORTS LANDING PATTERN IS CLOSE BY AND YOU CAN USAULLY SEE SOME AIRLINERS COMING IN FOR A LANDING OR DEPARTING DEPENDING ON WHICH RUNWAYS THEY ARE USING.  I WAS SCANNING THE SKY AND NOTICED A FEW AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA BUT NOTHING INTERESTING UNTIL I LOOKED UP TO THE STARS AND NOTICED A LIGHT THAT LOOKED LIKE A STAR BUT IT WAS MOVING AT A VERY HIGH SPEED.  IT WAS MOVING SOUTH IN A STRAIGHT LINE.  I THOUGHT I WAS LOOKING AT A SATALIGHT IN ORBIT BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH SPEED AND ALTITUDE.  I CONTINUED TO WATCH IT, I FIGURED IT WOULD CONTINUE ON UNTIL I COULDN'T SEE IT ANYMORE AND THEN I WOULD GO BACK INTO THE HOUSE AND WATCH TV.  BUT THEN I NOTICED IT WAS SLOWING DOWN. KEEP IN MIND THIS HAPPEND VERY QUICKLY.  I KNEW THIS WAS STRANGE I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING WITH THIS MUCH SPEED AND ALTITUDE PERFORM LIKE THIS. THIS THING BRAKED LIKE A PORSCHE ON STEROIDS!  I YELLED FOR CARRIE TO COME OUT AND LOOK BUT YOU KNOW HOW WOMEN CAN BE, FIRST THEY ASK WHY!  I DON'T THINK SHE MADE IT OFF THE SOFA BEFORE THIS THING CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP AND SHOT OFF TO THE NORTHEAST LIKE A SHOOTING STAR.  I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS JUST SAW.  IT DIDN'T SCARE ME BECAUSE IT WAS SO FAR UP IN THE SKY.  I WENT IN THE HOUSE AND WITH MUCH EXCITEMENT TOLD CARRIE WHAT I HAD JUST SEEN.  SHE DIDN'T SEEM INTERESTED SO I HAD TO TELL SOMEONE WHO SHARED MY ENTHUSIASM AND KNEW ENOUGH ABOUT AIRCRAFT AND TECHNOLOGY TO KNOW THIS WASN'T NORMAL!  SO I CALLED MY BROTHER IN BOWLING GREEN OHIO AND EXPLAINED IT TO HIM.  LUCKY FOR ME HE SEEMED INTERESTED OR I WOULD HAVE HAD TO CALL SOMEONE ELSE!  FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE READING THIS WITH GREAT INTEREST I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO REMEMBER THE EXACT DATE WITH A LITTLE RESEARCH I COULD NARROW IT DOWN TO THE CORRECT MONTH, WEEK, AND WITH PHONE RECORDS THE TIME AND DAY THIS HAPPENED.  ANOTHER NOTE: RECENTLY (YESTERDAY)ON THE DISCOVERY CANNE! L I SAW A CLIP OF VIDEO NASA RELEASED WITH MANY SIMILARITIES.

Distinct, isolated grouping of seven white orbs during the day several miles straight up (12 o'clock) that hovered then faded.;1999-09-01 12:45:00;20-30 minutes;Distinct, isolated grouping of seven white orbs during the day several miles straight up (12 o'clock) that hovered then faded. For me, this sighting was a big deal, but maybe not for you :)  This is the first time I had been invited to share my experience (via SciFi channel program 12/12/03.)  It\'s the first and last time I\'ve ever seen a UFO.  I was at the Cleveland National Air Show, and even though I\'m not sure of the exact date, I KNOW it was Labor Day weekend.  It was the last time the B-2 Bomber (awesome!) did a fly-by here, which I feel could be a key to this incident.  The incident occurred early in the show when the Golden Knights were enroute for their act.  I distinctly remember watching their plane slowly zigzagging at 9 o\'clock to reach the proper height for their jump.  It was a perfectly clear, warm sunny day, without a cloud in the sky ANYWHERE, which I found amazing in itself!  (Being in Cleveland, totally clear weather seldom occurs).  For some reason I looked straight up at 12 o\'clock and saw a clear grouping of 6-7 white orbs close to each other but not in a specific pattern. I think it was seven because I remember thinking it was an odd number.  I was with my ex-husband at the time and because it was early in the show, there wasn\'t anyone else sitting close to us (it figures). We were not on the main grounds of the show but at a nearby outdoor restaurant upper deck.  This sighting was NOT clouds!!!  I called my husband\'s attention to it at the time, and he was kind of freaked out and admitted he thought it was a UFO.  This was a macho man whose middle name is \denial.\  He didn't want to talk about it afterwords.  Anyway, all they did was hover for about 30 minutes more or less and I remember watching them slowly fade into nothing.  There was no sharp movement or changing colors, etc.  I did not see them around for the B-2 flyby, however, which was about 2 hours later.  That's it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Lights remained stationary.;2001-07-11 05:00:00;15 minutes +;A grouing of 3 lights forming a triangle, one very large light at the top with 2 small ones at the base. Lights remained stationary. At 5:00 AM I took my dogs outside to do their business, the sky was totally clear and full of stars.  I live quite a ways from the city and there is very little light polution so I often look at the stars.  I was gazing at the stars and was drawn to the ENE sky by an extremely large light.  My first reaction was that it was the headlight of an airplane especially since it was in the direction of Cleveland Hopkins airport.  The main light was so large it  amazed me, It was the size of a cars headlight when viewed in oncoming traffic.  Along with the main light were two other lights more star sized, with the main light they formed a triangle with the two smaller lights at the bottom.  I watched this grouping of lights for at least 15 minutes trying to figure out what they were.  I concluded they were not airplanes as they did not move or change size.  The lights did not twinkle like stars so I thought possibly  they were planets, but the odd arrangement and the extremely large light did not make sense.  I often look at the stars and am familuar with most of the constellations so to see this in the sky continues to puzzle me.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
High speed maneuvering lights;2001-09-12 22:10:00;10 to 30 seconds;High speed maneuvering lights After reading a recent report (#29034) I have decided to report an event I had witnessed 2 years ago that was nearly identical in nature with the exception of altitude and speed.  In the days after the events of 9/11/02 I knew the skies were empty of civilian traffic so I thought I would keep my eyes open for possibly any military traffic. After not seeing anything on the night of 9/11/02.  I stopped over a friends house the following evening (9/12/02) and after talking about it we headed outside at approximately 20:00 to 20:10 hours the skies were completely clear with quite a few stars and by luck within a few minutes of heading outside we both at the same time sighted (2) two lights moving in tandem with the southern light trailing the northern light at a distance of about one inch in relation to a thumb and forefinger of an out-stretched hand, I approximated them to be at orbital heights and speeds moving from East to West.  I immediatley considered them to be satellites due to their speed and brightness but thought it was odd that they were traveling in such close proximity to each other and at that instance the trailing southern light grew much brighter almost blueish in intensity than the northern light and suddenly burst ahead of the northern light.  Following this, the northern light also grew brighter and jumped ahead of the southern light,this occured at about the 1 o'clock position and as they crossed to about the 2 o'clock position they both began a counter clockwise spiral rotation around each other as if they were playing follow the leader.  We first picked up the objects up at approximately the 11 o'clock position and followed them through to just past the 2 o'clock position before loosing them in the light pollution of our city.  The entire time my friend and I were calling out to each other verifying what we each were seeing to be sure we were really seeing these objects and I specifically recall the excitment from both of us when the spiral maneuvers began.  I am an aircraft mechanic and a longtime aerospace/aircraft buff and have been employed by NASA since the mid 1990's, so I consider myself to be somewhat knowledgeable regarding aircraft/aerospace and I have on many occasions located, tracked and viewed various satellites and the Intermational Space Station this is why I had determined the objects to be of a orbital height and speed in relation to the time it was taking them to cross the night sky.  During the entire duration of this event there was no detectable noise and at the estimated heights it was impossible to determine if there was any type of shape associated with the two lights.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

Color-Changing Light Appears in Sky;2004-06-15 13:00:00;Two minutes;Color-Changing Light Appears in Sky During the afternoon in Summer 2004, I looked into the sky and noticed a small white light hovering above me.  There was a clear cloudless sky that day and it couldn't have been a cloud.  It was very distant, but it didn't seem to be moving.  I continued looking at the object when it changed colors: first to green, then to orange, then blue.   It began to float eastward, still changing colors, and then almost immeadiately turned south, an immeadiate 90 degree turn that no craft I can think of could handle. It floated away, southward, and eventually reached the horizon where it was out of view. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

It was a relatively clear nite, only a few cumulus clouds and unlimited visibilty. I saw a bright white light, slightly brighter than the ISS moving at high speed due east, initially thought it a satellite until I saw it bank southward hard 45 degrees. Just than I saw a plane almost overhead approx. 10,000 feet flying intercept to object, plane was unusual in that it seemed to fly much faster than regular commercial traffic and had a solid red light on belly, and a much brighter red flashing one in same general area, no blue wingtip lite seen and I was looking intently at it. As the plane neared about 4 to 5000 feet from object the light simply went out and vanished.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

It was Thursday, and not alot of activity was taking place which felt strange.  Only one club on each side of the river seemed to be open...with music and people..about 12 club/restaurants were closed... Any way...as we walked from the west bank toward the right bank, we stopped to glance at the view.  As we stood looking, I looked up and noticed a white fuzzy light above us traveling in an oval shaped pattern, and each time it revolved at the right end it sort of flashed slightly and without stopping, continued it's revolution.  I mentioned it to my husband as it looked to be part of the low cloud coverage (it was very cloudy that evening)....or above and in the cloud itself.  He thought it was caused by party/search lights, but there was no line of light source to this moving light.  I watched it circle above me, and it appeared to cover about 60 feet from where I stood...I do not know how low it was..and that is strange because the clouds were low, but...it was as high as the cloud....I am a skywatcher, and it just gets me that hardly anyone looks up at the sky.  As we proceeded to walk to the right bank, the light followed us.  We crossed a bridge, we walked across a very long empty parking lot....still above us.  We went into a club...and walked out the back...there it was above us.  We walked to the back and stood out on the dock...there it was.  We stayed awhile, and it just kept circling with it's flash.....I was a little nervous about it.  When we decided to back track and walk back to our car (same distance), it did the same thing.  My husband just ignored it, and that was a little weird...I thought maybe he just did not want to know any more about it....I decided to stop looking at it.  I never mentioned it to anyone at the club because they would probably laugh at me....but when we were on the dock patio...the people out there were just dancing or drinking or talking and not paying attention.  It seemed strange that no one would look up...anyway...I cannot figure this one out...My rational mind is trying to reason it out...but this light had an intelligence about it.  I could only make a shape from the precise and constant pattern of the light...it illuminated the clouds and had no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I decided to sit outside in my backyard after dark.  Recalled  watching the stars when I was a kid in East Springfield, PA and looked at the constellations and a few airplanes between swatting at mosquitoes. Was facing east. The sky was clear.  Off to the southeast  (about 40 degrees) I noticed  what appeared to be a plane with a strobe light taking the general flight path to Cleveland's lakefront airport. It was heading northeast.  The strobe became more impressive and it became readily apparent that it wasn't quite the same light as a normal aircraft would use partly because it suddenly grew quite bright.  The craft flew in a slightly erratic pattern slightly zig-zagging, then turned multi colored (red and blue) and disappeared.  Just like that.   Then  perhaps 20 seconds  later it reappeared  much further to the west  about 30 degrees behind my right shoulder  and  started to head east-southeast. No strobe, but it changed colors- blue and red. It flew as if it was surveying, not real fast but at a decent clip.   Then I lost isight of it in the distance.

Private Pilot/Amateur Astronomer Witnesses Satellite-like Object Make 2 Course Corrections;2007-11-08 21:30:00;5 Min;Private Pilot/Amateur Astronomer Witnesses Satellite-like Object Make 2 Course Corrections Not too long after sunset, with a very few broken clouds illuminated by street lights, a bright white light was noticed overhead while stargazing. It was similar to a typical satellite in its appearance and speed and it tracked rapidly on a heading of about 100 degrees just a little to the right of due east.  The brightness was steady and there were no rotating beacons, sound, nor change of colors noticed. The object tracked at about 100 degrees for approximately one minute, then angled to a new heading of approximately 120 degrees.  It remained on this heading for only about 30 seconds when it made another angular change to a heading of about 140 degrees, where it was at an elevation of about 45 degrees or thereabout. The object dimmed after about 15 seconds and was no longer visible.  It did not go behind a cloud.  From this, I gathered that it was a reflected light and the object dimmed as it moved into the earth's shadow.  This meant that the object was at considerable altitude and, by the short duration, was traveling rapidly. Being a private pilot, an amateur astronomer and general skeptic, I chose to report this sighting as something truly beyond anything I have ever witnessed in the sky at night.

The orbs did not appear to be very large, but were a fair distance from the stadium, several miles. The first orb was flying solo, from NE to SW below cloud level , followed by two identical orbs about one minute later.    They were flying faster and lower than the incoming jet.  Flying in a straight trajectory but slightly rising and falling.   As they approached the shoreline, they took a direct path west and moved exceptionally fast out of sight gone in the blink of an eye.  Too fast to be a known man made craft.

I was looking out my 6th floor apartment window towards the west (towards Lakewood, Rocky River, and points west along the Lake Erie shoreline).  Several (15) balls of light came up from the horizon, made an arc movement into the sky, and proceeded to quickly move towards Lake Erie.  Within about 30 seconds, each light would be over the lake and they disappeared as they moved towards Canada.  They were crossing paths of planes on approach to Cleveland Hopkins that were also out over Lake Erie. They were moving much faster than the planes, seemed to be above the planes that were coming in to land, and they had no flashing lights like the planes (just a red ball of light).  Weirdest thing I've ever seen, no explanation other than they were definitely not satellites, meteors, planes, or lanterns (I've seen all of these before).;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

Roughly 10:00 pm EST, on August 20, 2014, my boyfriend and I saw what appeared to be a bright star/sphere like light object, traveling from the west heading east across the sky.  The visibility of the sky was completely clear of any clouds, making all the stars and airplanes visible to the naked eye.   The appearance of the object my boyfriend and I saw was much brighter, and larger than any star.  The object was traveling at the rate of which seemed to be a fast airplane, but had no blinking lights, as all of the airplanes seen in the sky flying at the same time had.   The object headed to what seemed to be directly across the sky right over us, bearing no sound, and suddenly appeared to change direction heading  south in the sky away from us, toward a star in the sky.  We continued to watch it closely, almost in dismay captivated, as the object still had no sign of any blinking lights and had no change in its form staying a consistent bright sphere of light.   The object appeared to then not just be flying south, but straight up toward the star just south of us.  As we watched my my boyfriend stated “look it’s starting to fade”, and then right before our eyes  the object just disappeared which happened in seconds. I was absolutely dumbfounded, the object appeared to be there in the sky one moment and then what I would describe as it telescoping, farther straight up in the sky, and as it did so, it seemed to have a reddish color as it vanished into the sky.  Something like out of a movie, as a star ship might go into hyper drive, and all you see is the afterburners of its jets. The whole occurrence lasted about 60 seconds, to a minute and a half long.  Regretfully, I have no footage as my boyfriend and I describe  to one another as being memorized, trying to figure out what exactly it was we were looking at, which when the object eerily disappeared in seconds from the sky, we had both agreed that what we had just seen was a UFO.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
