small whit globe-like objects seen on clear day doing srange things.;2000-07-19 17:00:00;2-3 min.;small whit globe-like objects seen on clear day doing srange things. it was a partly cloudy day. we were downtown to see a play. i heard a helicopter and looked up. it was pulling an advertisment. as it passed, i happened to notice something else far above it. the sky in this area was clear--blue. my eyes focused and as i concentrated i saw 2,then more, white globes about the size of 1/2 inch at arms length. they were moving around, not fast or slow, but staying in the general area. i told my friend to look up. she saw them too. they were very high, but we could see them pretty well. the main thing was that one started going in a tight circle. then another followed in the same circle. they did not go fast or slow. after about a minute, some clouds got in the way for a few seconds. we then were able to see one of the objects move off to the north at a fairly rapid pace. we lost it after 20 seconds or so when it was hidden from our view by high cirris clouds. we could not see/find more. were NOT birds. they were white and globe-like. they moved smoothly and intelligently.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
Many fighter jets flying towards UFO;2004-10-03 19:05:00;30sec.;Many fighter jets flying towards UFO the object was cirlce and a bright light.  There was about 10 fighter jets flying towards it and it vanished.  It came back and I saw the UFO and took a picture.  After looking at the picture their is another UFO at the same location but higher away and further away.  It was a clear day with many fighter jets around looking for it. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know if this is intended to be a serious report.  Fighters usually are not launched in such large numbers as the report states was allegedly the case.  Ten fighters in a small airspace tend to get in the way of one another.  However, we will request a copy of the photograph that apparently was taken of the object.

Circle (Silver) perfect in shape, flying at speeds at least 3X faster than a fighter jet;2004-11-12 15:15:00;20 seconds;Circle (Silver) perfect in shape, flying at speeds at least 3X faster than a fighter jet At approx. 3:00 to 3:30 PM on November 12, 2004  I looked out my front door and noticed several fighter jets in a perfectly clear sky... I immediately went back in and got a co worker to come outside and look at the fighter jets making contrails...As I was counting the fighter jets (I counted (8) eight within relatively close proximity, My co-worker says What is that??  I look up and see a PERFECT Circle (appeared to be Silver) Going VERY, VERY Fast - Probably 3 or 4 times faster than the jets... We continue to ask each other what it is as it fly's across the sky taking only about 20 seconds to fly over head and into the distance where we could no longer see it.  My co-worker and I agree we had never seen anything like it before ...It didn't have wings, and it didn't leave a contrail like the fighter jets The 8 fighter jets in the sky seemed to excititedly change course shortly after it passed by... I was almost as impressed with the number of fighter jets as I was with the flying object... I have never reported a sighting like this before in my entire life.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

A number of suspected hoaxed telephoned reports from Brook Park, OH, placed by young teenagers, on next day, included profanity and less than serious comments.  However, we are reconsidering our position, given that a television station in the area of the sightings, as well as the local police, received a number of telephone calls, and written reports, about the event.

Saw a cloud-like object making swift, wide, regular circles over and over.;2006-03-13 09:25:00;5min+;Saw a cloud-like object making swift, wide, regular circles over and over. While taking our dog out, I saw one round cloud that was lit up brighter than the rest of the sky. This cloud was moving very quickly in an orbiting fashion against a slow moving sky.  While there were other clouds, this one was different and wasn't behaving as the rest were. I've never seen anything like it. I can only compare its movement to the movement shown on radar screens seen in movies. I stopped watching as I was the only one home and a little nervous!

Floated then took of upward and west until disappeared. Flickering orange-red ball over lake Erie just west of the Cuyahoga rRver.  The object was just kind of floating and almost did a slow figure eight pattern.   Then it took off directly up and west until it disappeared.   I got a really crappy picture that basically just shows an orange-red ball.   I saw a similar object floating over my apartment building about a year ago.  The apartment sits in downtown Cleveland on lake Erie.   There was one other witness to that sighting and we both went outside to get a better look and it was gone.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

The UFO was seen for about 3 seconds with the bright lights visible and after that about 3 seconds it turned off the lights and while proceeding to travel in the same direction at the same speed. I could then still see a slight visual of the aircraft for about 2 more seconds.  Then that's when i no longer saw the aircraft.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

I have know idea what this thing is or it's purpose but it's been in the sky everyday. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Arcturus.  PD));41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

The UFOs came from east to west of downtown Cleveland, the height was about 6,000ft, the speed was about a helicopters speed.   Here's what happened:  I looked up at the sky and the UFOs almost 20 of them visible to me, were behind each other in a very organized way.  As the group of UFOs were moving, they had a blue looking light next to them.  While the rest of the aircrafts/UFOs were leaving I tried to take pictures of them, but I only caught two on my camera they headed north above Lake Erie, my estimation is that they went up to 10,000 ft and higher where it isn't visible to a human eye.  I tried to record all this and when I went back on my gallery the video was gone, I was pretty sure I took.  My friend sent me the pictures she took, instead.
