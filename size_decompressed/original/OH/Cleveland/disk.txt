My family was in Cleveland for a wedding, staying at my aunts house in Lakewood.I was sleeping in a bedroom with my mom and little 4 year old brother.While sleeping I got a wierd feeling and opened my eyes, faceing the window I looked out and saw a glowing ball in the distance. It was a bright white light, like no light i have seen since. Scared stiff I tryed to call to my mother but nothing came out I screamed mom,mom in my head but my ears did not hear me say it.Then after 1 minute of so she got up by motherly instinct i guess.Mother looked outside and saw it comeing closer by now we could see it was a disc shape.My mom than got my two aunts up and my little brother.She tryed to wake up my unkle but could not.We all went out on the back porce to get a better look,now the disc was getting real close and we where all scared yet we just stood there watching the disc.The disc was bright white light and in the middle there was reflections all the way across and right in the center it looked like a plus font [+]or a cross maybee, it was real hard to focus.The disc stopped about 20 to 30 feet above the ground right over a tree and just hovered there size was 40 feet across.No sound no tree leaves moveing total silence.Now please understand the whole time I should have been wide awake yet it was all i could do to sta! y awake.My aunt walked under the tree and threw a stick up and thats all i remember .The next thing I recall is standing outside and the disc is gone.My mom called my unkle in Circleville Ohio dureing this event.He remembers the call.Whats funny is after all these years we are just now starting to talk about it agian.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

Dear Sirs, My name is ((name deleted)) 36yr old biomedical engineering tech for a local dialysis center. I observed on date reported;1999-11-16 19:10:00;5 seconds;Dear Sirs, My name is ((name deleted)) 36yr old biomedical engineering tech for a local dialysis center. I observed on date reported four identically shaped objects equidistance in a straight line heading due East, possibly one or two degrees Southward over my left shoulder as I was walking South with my dog. It lit up the whole E. sky. They trailed a yellowish, reddish tail in a flat trajectory I believe at about 9 to 12 thousand feet. They went from 1230 to 900 in about 4 seconds...it was THE most incredible event I have ever witnessed! It was truly awe inspiring. see above;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
