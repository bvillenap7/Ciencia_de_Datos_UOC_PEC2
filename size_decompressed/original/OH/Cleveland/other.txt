It was stationary for the few seconds that I saw it. The vanished into thin air. I was on my way to pick up my children and was watching the clouds as we live near the lake and I had left the windows open and was worried it would begin to storm. As I was driving I just looked up and was also watching the car in front of me on I-90 and suddenly I saw  this object that appeared in the clouds and it was very shiney and bright and it looked like a giant bell. It was only in the clouds for a matter of 30 seconds maybe a little longer and then when I went to make sure I was not getting too close to the car in front of me, it vanished. I saw no trails and I know that it was not the blimp nor was it an aircraft as it was stationary.I picked up my children and we looked again in the clouds on the way home but the clouds were starting to clear and we didn't see anything.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
A UFO With Red, Blue & Green lights alternating between the colors and gliding and Hovering;2006-05-19 22:00:00;5 minutes;A UFO With Red, Blue & Green lights alternating between the colors and gliding and Hovering I was driving home and I looked up and saw green lights all in a row like a bar across, then the lights went out then in the same place I saw all blue lights across in a row, then the lights went out then in the same place I saw all red lights across in a row, then I saw the outline of the craft which was dark in color. It glided left then right, then left then right, then hovered, then glided a few houses down, then glided left , then right, then hovered, then glided a few more houses down and kept doing that till I lost sight of it behind some trees, then I didn't see it again.  All the while, the lights kept going from all red, to all blue to all green over and over and the light would stay the one color for like 5 seconds then turn all blue then all green over and over as it glided and hovered.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

Two wings were green, two wings were red-the wings were the lights. -was by W.98th St. -I was on 90West freeway-near Lakewood, Ohio.

Here is some additional information:  70-80 ft above the ground.  100ft horizontally.  I was going 60 miles an hour.  The craft was going east-towards the airport.

Caught two bright UFOs.  Strange smaller objects seemed to appear out of nowhere nearby, ONLY in the pictures!;2017-09-24 02:00:00;1 hour;Caught two bright UFOs. Strange smaller objects seemed to appear out of nowhere nearby, ONLY in the pictures! I looked out my window at 2:00am witnessing a bright light in the sky between an opening through the leaves of a large tree in my backyard.  The light was larger than any star in the sky.  It was larger than any visible planet.  As I watched it, I noticed it was moving.  With the help of the leaves, I could tell the pace of the movement more easily, because it disappeared behind the leaves.  It moved faster than stars in the sky, but much slower than airplanes, satellites, etc. So, I grabbed my good camera and tripod and ran to my back porch.  I found openings between leaves and branches by standing, kneeling and in between then adjusted my tripod, zoomed in 30x, and began snapping pictures.  It seemed to first be moving upwards in the sky. So I would have to adjust my tripod higher up.  Then it started on a slow path downward on what I believe was about a 150-160 degree angle.  Eventually it seemed to stop and go straight downward, at a 90 degree angle, for the remainder of the sighting.  I ended up having my tripod go from all the way down, to all the way up, then all the way down again. I almost felt like the object wanted to observe something on the ground, maybe the nearby airport, or maybe the NASA Glenn Research Center, within 5-7 miles south of the objects.  It moved slowly enough for most to not think twice when seeing it, maybe thinking it is just a large bright star.  Although it was definitely larger and closer than even the largest star that can ever be observed in the sky, from the ground that is.  I have been studying UFOs and E.T.s  for a year now, since my first sighting.  So I definitely noticed that I was seeing something different here.  I see things all of the time but this is by far one of the coolest sightings I have had. I focused on this object that usually remained red and blue in the pictures pulsating fast in a pattern of red, white, blue.  What I found very strange, were these smaller copper/silver colored objects that appeared only in the photos near the main object. I did not see these objects myself at all, but they were obviously there.  Then I noticed another object very similar to the main one I was already snapping photos of.  This one however, seemed to be blinking fast between the main colors of orange/red, white and yellow rather than red, white and blue.  The last photo attached is of the orange object. I observed these objects between 2-3am. I do not know of a man made or known space object that moves the speed and direction that it did and looks like the pictures I have attached.  The whole time I felt that I was witnessing something really special.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
contact transparent biological entity on going;2020-03-28 23:00:00;on going;contact transparent biological entity on going Shortly after St Patricks’ day 2018 (I’ve have been Sober since St Pats’ 1994), I came in direct contact of a transparent biological entity the size of nickel. It will not go into great deal because there is too much to go over. I have done much empirical research. Since that time there numbers have expanded into the thousands, also I have encountered many different species. This is 24/7 experience with no let up! I am disabled I am not lonely or seeking attention! These biological entities have become so thick it’s like swimming between there dimension and mine! If I rake them with a broom it goes right through them like nothing happen. However I can gently push them aside with my wood cane. 	I live on the seventh floor. I believe I am in a nest or nursery! When I sleep the young small ones cling to me like I am a queen bee. I can only sleep in my bed when there is sunlight. The larger ones sleep inside my mattress and sting or bite me till I leave. Right now it is 10/24/2020 and this siege is still going on.
