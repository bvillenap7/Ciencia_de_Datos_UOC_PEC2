Cant rember month but there was no leaves on trees.  I saw a kite shaped object about the size of a two story house descending at a 60 degree angle. It was moving slowly and silently. It disappered behind the trees in the distance and I just kept driving but I remember thinking it was a really odd looking thing. descending at about a 60 degree angle I say it was diamond shape but it was not equal on all sides. It was a grey-black color with no lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1985 is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in October so that the report sorts to 1985.

Black diamond with red light on bottom tip flying over little league feild just after dark.;2006-08-15 20:00:00;10 minutes;Black diamond with red light on bottom tip flying over little league feild just after dark. My husband and his co umpire were there but were'nt watchng.  I happened to look up and saw an unlit/black diamond (from my angle) with a red blinking light on the bottom point.  Not sure if there was one on the top.  It flew or glided about 30 feet above the empty little feild where just the dim lights were on after the game.  It seemed to come from the trees and slightly decend but it kept going until it crossed the field and disapeared over the buidlings.  It was probably about as big a large door way in a school building or a possibly a very large trash can.  I would say it was going at about twenty mph if not slower.  It made no noise, i would have never known it was there if i hadn't turned my head to look.  The game had ended maybe 45 minutes before and in the summer months since it was dark outside, it had to be around 9 to 10 pm. 9:45 maybe.
