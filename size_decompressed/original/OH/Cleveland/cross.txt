IT IS NICE TO KNOW THAT OTHERS HAVE SEEN CROSS SHAPED UFO'S WITH LIGHTS THAT STRETCH  ACROSS BOTH LINES OF THE ENTIRE CROSS (+)!;1979-06-01 16:00:00;20MINUTES+;((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) IT IS NICE TO KNOW THAT OTHERS HAVE SEEN CROSS SHAPED UFO'S WITH LIGHTS THAT STRETCH  ACROSS BOTH LINES OF THE ENTIRE CROSS (+)! AT THE TIME I WAS VISITING FRIENDS.  THEY HAD A SMALL HOUSE IN THE BACK OF THE MAIN HOUSE, AND I HAD LEFT MY CIGARRET LIGHTER THERE.  AS WE LEFT THE SMALL HOUSE TO ENTER THE MAIN HOUSE I REMEMBERED I LEFT MY LIGHTER.  MY FRIENDS WENT ON INTO THE MAIN HOUSE AND I WENT BACK INTO THE SMALL REAR HOUSE TO GET MY LIGHTER.  AS I LEFT THE SMALL HOUSE ENTERING THE MAIN HOUSE I LOOKED UP INTO THE SKY AND THERE WAS WHAT APPEARED TO BE A PLANE BUT, IT HOVERED RIGHT OVER HEAD....I STOOD WATCHING IT.  I WOULD SWEAR I HEARD VOICES COMING FROM IT, AND I WOULD SWEAR I STOOD OUT THERE A GOOD 20MINUTES OR MORE.  I COULD ALMOST SAY I UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE VOICES  WERE SAYING BUT,I COULD NOT REPEAT IT.  AFTER A WHILE THE UFO SPEED OFF AT A FAST RATE OF SPEED OUT OF SIGHT.  WHEN I GOT IN THE HOUSE WITH MY FRIENDS THEY ASKED WHY IT TOOK ME SO LONG, AND I TOLD THEM OF WHAT I HAD SEEN.  THEY LAUGHED AT ME OF CORSE BUT, I-KNOW-WHAT-I-SAW!.  WHEN I GOT HOME I TOLD MY FAMILY, AND THEY TOO THOUGHT I WAS LOOSING IT.  UNTIL NOW I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ANYONE SEEING A CROSS-SHAPED UFO THEN I READ YOUR SIGHTINGS OF CROSS SHAPED UFO'S.  IT BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES.  AS OF RESENT I HAVE NOTICED PLANES WITH THE LIGHTS AT THE BOTTOM THAT STRETCHED FROM ONE END OF ALL FOUR LINES (+) TO THE CENTER BUT, THEY WERE PLANES.  I LOOK FORWARD TO ANOTHER UFO ENCOUNTER, AND SOON.  THERE ARE OCCUPIED UFO'S OUT THERE AND THEY ARE NOT ALL HARMFUL TO MAN.  LIKE HUMANS, THE ALLIENS COME IN A VARIETY OF PERSONALITIES, AND IN THE NEAR FUTURE WE WILL KNOW WHAT THEIR PURPOSE IS, AND WHY THEY CHOSE CERTAIN HUMANS TO SEE THEM OR THEIR CRAFTS. IN 1994, THEIR WERE TWO ALLIENS IN OUR APARTMENT. THE SHORT ONE ON THE INSIDE OF OUR DOOR AND THE TALLER ONE ON THE OUTSIDE OF OUR APARTMENT DOOR.  WHEN I SAW THEM I FAINTED, AND MY TWO SONS WOKE ME.  WHEN I TOLD THEM WHAT I HAD SEEN, THEY LAUGHED.  BUT, AGAIN I-SAW-WHAT-I-SAW!. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER WRITTEN TO ANYONE WHAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED BECAUSE, I REALLY FEEL THE GOVERNMENT KEEP RECORDS, AND LOCATIONS OF THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED UFO OR ALLIEN ENCOUNTERS.  BUT, AFTER READING THE SITINGS OF CROSS SHAPED UFO'S I FEEL COMFORTABLE IN SHARING WITH OTHERS MY EXPERIENCE. I ALSO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE SO WE CAN SHARE WITH ONE ANOTHER OUR UFO EXPERIENCES. PEACE BE WITH YOU ALL, AND YOURS.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
