Originally looked like a 'firework passed east to west as i was looking north. Witnessed the event driving home. Chief Meteorologist of Local TV Station. Saw object in western sky, moving east. Large object, but at high altitude. Not consistant with a 'normal' meteor. Speed not consistant with 'normal' meteor... it was much slower. When objects split up, over the city... they remained at constant velocity with parent object.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

Large Ball of Fire with alot of scattered fire and sparking around it and following it. Bright Fire Red. Very Large north of Cleveland. Did not have the arc of a shooting star.

Sphere,  big as a setting sun(yet no illumination beyond the sphere itself) sitting and then sinking below the horizon over Lake Erie;2006-03-07 02:40:00;5-10 minutes;Sphere,  big as a setting sun(yet no illumination beyond the sphere itself) sitting and then sinking below the horizon over Lake Erie I live about 12 houses from lake erie, and was leaving my house around 2:40am. As I pulled out of my drive, I noticed what looked like a harvest moon sitting right on Lake Erie.  I almost drove away not thinking anything of it, but I decided to drive up to the waters edge to have a closer look. The shape that I saw was spherical, but only 60% percent of it was viewable(similiar to a cresent moon).  It was about the size of the sun just before it sets over the lake during the summer months. It was fiery orange red in color. It seemed very bright yet the illumination did not go beyond the sphere itself. At this point I still, may have left just thinking what I saw was odd, but the sphere seemed to be dissappearing below the horizon.  I decided to race back home and get my digital camera.  I drove down my street, pulled in my drive and looked back towards the lake and noticed that only half of the visible portion of the sphere remained. I ran into my house grabbed my camera, ran back out and it was gone. This sphere that seemd to be as big as the sun setting in a summer evening sank below the horizon in a mere 5 minutes...;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
green fireball over cleveland,ohio;2010-04-06 22:05:00;3-5min;green fireball over cleveland,ohio I was driving on 271N passing the Chagrin Rd exit and saw a green fireball falling from the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  If the duration of the sighting was, in fact, 3-5 minutes, the object, almost certainly, was not a typical meteor.  PD));41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
Fireball like object flying east to west along shoreline near downtown Cleveland;2011-07-04 01:50:00;2 minutes;Fireball like object flying east to west along shoreline near downtown Cleveland I am an EMS helicopter pilot in the Cleveland Ohio area with a two nurse crew this morning.  We had just dropped off a patient on the rooftop helipad of a hospital three miles east of downtown Cleveland and were preparing to depart for base when all three of us witnessed a fireball like object. At approximately 1:50 AM, July 4th, 201, I was preparing for engine start when I observed this fireball like circular object flying from east to west just north of our position.  It appeared closest when I first saw it.  This is an area of intense air traffic so it took a second look to determine it did not look like an airplane.  At this particular time of morning there were no other aircraft seen. I immediately jumped out of the cockpit and went back to the crew loading our equipment and told them check this out.  All three of us watched the object fly over the shoreline at approximately 3000 to 4000 ft.  Maybe a speed of 150kts at least.  We tried to determine if it was an airliner as this is the same area they fly on their approach to Cleveland Hopkins airport.  However there were no position lights and no strobes.   We could not see any structure except for the roundness and color.  It was a yellow golden sphere with red on the sides (See drawing).  The bright red seemed to have the characteristic of fire or vertical flames but was not flames.  It was not underneath only on the sides with a little on the top.  It was like red electrical fire.  It did not look like jet propulsion. I am not an artist but I did attempt to draw what I saw and that is included here.  I would estimate a fairly good sized object, at least 10-20 feet across.  It flew east to west over the shoreline.  As it approached downtown proper it turned northwest and departed out over the lake at a constant altitude and airspeed. ((NUFORC Note:  One of two excellent reports from this source.  To read the other, go to the reports for the morning of March 09, 2010, and read the report from Middlefield, OH.

Glowing fireball object traveling in Cleveland sky NW towards the Lake?;2011-10-07 23:36:00;5 minutes?;Glowing fireball object traveling in Cleveland sky NW towards the Lake? My husband and I were leaving a party and walking to our car.  As we walked down the sidewalk, I looked up and saw an orange orb/fireball thing heading across the sky.  I kept saying to my husband, What is that?   What is that?   But he (who is usually my debunker) had no response.  He kept saying it had no propulsion.  (I had to ask him what that meant.)I slowly took out my iPhone and just snapped.  The fireball object traveled slowly and steady NW, (maybe towards Lake Erie?).  We watched it until it was out of sight.   I will email two photos.  One is the fireball object, and the second is what it looked like after it traveled further away and was almost out of sight.  I’m not sure how high up it was, but it was low enough to catch our eye.  We were near the airport, but in this area, we are used to the landing patterns of the airplanes and this was definitely not an airplane.  Also, the airplanes that evening were landing to the SW. I would love it if someone looked at this and could explain what we saw.  So, if it’s not a UFO, oh well, but we are still scratching our heads!;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
Fast bright object very high up in the sky.;2012-11-22 06:00:00;2-4 seconds;Fast bright object very high up in the sky Very high in the sky, spotted an extremely bright object like a welders torch.  Object appeared directly up in the horizon traveling south to north in a short straight line as I was star gazing while walking my dog.  It appeared as a bright object for a couple of seconds and disappeared just as bright spanning 3-6 degrees in the horizon.  No trail noticed.  Nothing like a shooting star or meteor shower and many times faster and brighter a plane.  Too fast to be noticed unless looking up in that direction by chance...;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
Large fiery orange ball/cylinder of light hovering for 4-5 minutes near Lake Erie on the west side of Cleveland Ohio;2014-07-11 23:15:00;5 minutes;Large fiery orange ball/cylinder of light hovering for 4-5 minutes near Lake Erie on the west side of Cleveland Ohio I was out looking at the moon because I had heard tomorrow was supposed to be a super moon.   Out of nowhere, the bright orange light appeared.  Small at first, but I thought maybe it was a planet (saturn, venus)and that the clouds moved away.  But the orange light grew bigger, then hung in the sky right in front of my house, above some pine trees.  If I had to estimate the distance, it was probably about where a helicopter would fly.   The orange light was like a fireball so I thought maybe it was a meteor but it didn't move.   It also looked like it had an orange light beam coming from it.  Its shape was almost like that of a flood light, like square cylinder shape but fiery orange.  I ran to get my camera, and of course, just like on tv shows, my camera froze.  It gave me a creepy feeling, like it was observing me.   I then noticed it started to shrink, but then realized it wasn't shrinking, it was heading west. It had to have been moving quickly to shrink out of site! that fast.   I am about 4 blocks from Lake Erie and it was heading west.  I just didn't feel right, didn't seem like a natural phenomenon.  Very strange and uneasy feeling..;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
Orange flying ball with shapes of light spinning around it.;2016-09-24 00:00:00;9 minutes;Orange flying ball with shapes of light spinning around it. As we were standing out side of our office building (The city club building), a round orange object came down from the sky, almost like a comet, then it just stopped directly over our building and we could see small shapes on it spinning.  We video recorded it as it moved behind another building then hovered beside the PC bank building across from us for couple mins then it shot away towards the lake;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
