Then verified by C & B well above sloped rooftops of houses next street south, moving horizontally just above power lines. The lack of visible wings and lack of any vapor trail behind object was most notible one observor speculated it may be a rocket of some sort, but no exhaust was seen and no sounds were heard. The object passed behind broad Vapor trails created by passenger aircraft moving in opposite direction. As we talked and walked westward toward my garage, it became easier to lose sight of object as it slowly receeded into the southwestern sky into haze and partial overcast.  No wings or rudder structures or emanations noted by any of us. It moved much faster than the occasional Goodyear Blimp often seen in this area, and any lighter than air craft we've seen is shaped like fat cigar, with markings or running lights which this shiny object never displayed. We are hoping to see a report on this sighting on the 11 pm news, but still skeptical.  It was suggested this object could be a large satellite in orbit, but even the ISS should not appear so large from this latitude.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
My boyfriend and I saw a red cylinder object in the sky up close above a house and it was big.;2013-06-02 23:00:00;30 seconds;My boyfriend and I were sitting on the porch and saw a red cylinder object in the sky up close above a house and it was bigger than the size of a full moon.   We were looking north and the object began flying west at a really fast speed until we saw it disappear through the clouds.   As it began flying away it looked as though it was getting smaller and by the time we took the pictures it was almost gone and the object was quiet we didn't hear anything.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
