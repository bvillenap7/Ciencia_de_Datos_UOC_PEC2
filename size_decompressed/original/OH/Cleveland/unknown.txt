There all night on 8/30/02 and again on 8/31/02.  Nasa says its space station in low orbit, but details don't line up-- NASA claims we can see station for several minutes b4 sunrise, in western sky, not all night not moving in eastern sky.

Numerous sightings over Cleveland;2004-07-06 14:30:00;.5 hours;Numerous sightings over Cleveland Hello All,  Since 7/6/04 there has been ongoing weird sightings and military presence in the Cleveland Ohio area. While on vacation and walking my dogs I saw a b2 bomber and at least 2 f18's in the area, mostly over the nuke plants yet meandering hither and yon over the city. Never did see exactly what they were looking for. All I know is that the rumble from the b2's engine made the air in my lungs vibrate. Deep and throaty powerful roar. WTAM am radio station even did a special segment on all the frequent sightings in approx. 7/6 to 9/25. And don't even mention contrails. I really think they are trying to obscure our view of what really is going on up there. The most dramatic sighting was on 8/20/04 when I was out catching a smoke. I saw at about 1030 pm est a yellow cloud with a very bright white light in the center of it travelling at about the speed of ISS or just a little faster heading ESE and making about a 15 degree tilt to the South. This thing was big. The size of a basketball with fist outstretched. I really wanted to start screaming but my neighbors were asleep. All that came out was repeated 'oh my God' in a whisper. I cannot even give a good description because it was so anomalous to anything I have ever seen before. It looked like a shape shifter like a yellow aurora with a friggin bright white light right in the center. Between all the heavy contrails and numerous sightings leaves me a little disturbed. I just hope they can show us how to make energy cheap before we destroy this planet with fossil fuel. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD));41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
Unidentifiable object over Cleveland, Ohio;2004-07-07 20:00:00;just a few seconds;Unidentifiable object over Cleveland, Ohio It was sometime between 2000 and 2045 HRS, I looked up into the sky and noticed an object flying in a pattern not common to commercial flights (most comm. flights fly east and west here - both directions, never northwest to southeast). It looked as if it was flying around 40,000 ft. (est.), and was in straight line motion. A small cloud cluster was moving into it's path below it (8,000-15,000 ft.). I was going to grab my camcorder, but didn't want to take my eyes off of it. As the clouds passed in front of the object, I expected it to reappear on the other side...but nothing ever emerged. I scanend the sky for a possible turn or movement in another direction, but there was just local traffic overhead around 2,000 to 4,000 ft. landing at our local airport. Viewing only lasted about 8-10 seconds before it vanished. Looking to the northwest sky, at about a 70-80 degree angle, from a location of 41.45903N / 81.70817W;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
Strange lights over Cleveland;2007-01-07 00:00:00;2 hrs;Strange lights over Cleveland I looked up into the sky at about 12:00 am and I saw these lights, there were a total of I would say five. They were different colors, yellow and orange.  The lights would stay still for a few moments and then they would take off very fast.  They hovered around for at least two hours, then they just disappeared.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

We both looked up into the dark night sky and saw several lights close together as if attached red, blue, green and so on giving the appearance of a large craft looking from the bottom similar to one of a star wars movie.  My mother soon arrived and as we drove home three spherical lights seemed to follow and hovered over my house as I exited the car from the short drive two more lights emerged and hovered over as well.  Going inside I looked out my window and within the few seconds it took for my going inside they disappeared.  I later heard of similar events on the news over tower city.

A picture of aliens painted in  parking lot at an apartment complex!;2010-08-14 09:00:00;after watching show on tv;A picture of aliens painted in  parking lot at an apartment complex! After watching a show about alien sightings on tv for about two days on tv and the next couple of days there are there bodies painted on the driveway.  It seems to be three painted shapes of the aliens, according to the television show, and they have three heads seems like they are walking all together and the heads are all in a line in straight row and the bodies seem like they are floating on a cloud or showing something that floating, and the three bodies are directly above the scratching of(alot of paint) showing of something floating. The bodies are thin and and seem like they are all walking. There are no arms just a dot and straight long line the part attached to the head is one straight line and the last two lines are the legs spread apart as if they are walking.   I just thought it seems funny and this picture is painted on the parking lot of all silver paint (alien paint maybe or of some chemical.  It's not real messy, but it is big enough that peo! ple were scare to park their cars there.   The the direction of the picture had to come from directly above my apartment.  The three aliens had to have landed on the roof top and make this picture.  The picture is pointed directly towards my window.  The silver paint is nothing like I've seen it.   I don't think it can be removed.  I think it has to be completely painted over or dug up to remove the object shape on the ground.  The whole complex has to of seen this object or painting in the driveway.  The channel that I seen this television show is the history channel about the aliens. I believe this is an contact from the other side. When I took the pictures, I feel really funny after I took the picture.  Thanks for letting me report this.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
I saw a bright light that looked like a star that began to circle the sky with two white lights and one red light flashing.;2013-09-14 23:45:00;30-40 minutes;I saw a bright light that looked like a star that began to circle the sky with two white lights and one red light flashing. Saturday September 16, 2013  It was about 11:30-12:00 when I saw what at first appeared to be a beautiful bright star, that bright star is what got my attention.  I gazed out of the window to get a better view of that big bright beautiful star that was sitting in the northeast sky it began to move more toward the east then it circled back toward the west and as it headed more toward the west I could see two white lights flashing in a sequence of three and one red light. It headed back to that same point of the northeast sky that bright light would “enhance” for lack of a better word then fade then begin the same circling routine all over again this went on about fifteen times and as I watched it, at one point I thought I could see a massive ship through the clouds but I can’t make that my claim as of today but that made me “think” that those lights where coming from the front of the ship. After about the fifteenth circle the ship flew away so fast heading east leaving a line of smoke in the sky.  I’ve seen a different kind of ship flying around in that same exact area a few years ago this ship was not circling as far out as the ship that I saw last night, it had sort of a search light on it, as if it was a car in the sky with its high beams on circling and circling.   It was moving much faster and then it just faded away into the clouds it was in plain sight anyone could have just looked up and saw it me and my daughter watched it until it faded away. I could see a Clear, Straight, Path into the sky no trees or anything preventing my View;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867

Very LOUD, sonic boom type sounds at 10 o'clock sharp, repeated.  First was loudest by far.   Never recall hearing such a sound...  My first thought was that is was like the Blue Angels from the air show only WAAAY bigger..   My boyfriend and I felt a major panic, I must admit...   Now it sounds like fireworks in the distance...

They disappeared to the southeast.  I, and some other ground observers, wondered what they were chasing, or where they were going.  Weird.  This is not a typical aircraft exercise area.  No.  No UFOs seen.  Just in case someone else saw something at that time in the Cleveland area.;41.4814115514587;-81.6290857142867
