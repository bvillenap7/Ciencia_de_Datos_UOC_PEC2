Appeared to be either a string of lights or a plane pulling lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));2019-05-25 22:50:00;15-20 seconds;My wife and weâ€™re in our hot tub, stargazing and plane spotting as we normally do when we observed what appeared to be either a string of lights or a plane pulling lights.  It was as long as the distance from the tip of my index finger to the tip of my little finger with my arm extended.  It was moving from west southwest to east northeast. It was fairly long in duration, meaning 15-20 seconds.  The lights being pulled varied in intensity, either from their own light or from reflected sunlight even though the sun had set a couple of hours earlier.  The second to the last light forex very brightly but there was still another light being pulled or following behind it.   I am a retired police officer and my wife is a retired nurse. We had not been drinking. Thirty four or so years ago I observed a Russian satellite beaming apart in the night sky.  I then saw at least three objects streaming through the sky which were slowly spreading last nights observation differe! d in that all of the objects were traveling in a straight line and what appeared to the same speed.  I have seen hundreds of meteors, but they last for only a second or so. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites.  PD));40.9666;-81.4184999999998
