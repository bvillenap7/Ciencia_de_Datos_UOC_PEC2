Heavy clouds moved in quickly and 2 extremely bright orange lights appeared following each other in a northwest direction.  They disappeared, followed about 10 minutes later by 2 more bright orange objects followed by a super bright red light object.  All followed the same path as the first 2.  Once the last 3 disappeared, the clouds immediately moved out and the sky was crystal clear.  These lights had no sound, and there was no blinking lights on them even though we live close to the airport, there were no planes at the time landing or taking off at the time.;40.9666;-81.4184999999998
