Hi  I recently called in last night an talked with someone from your organization today about what I saw.  First off it was about 10:15-10:25 on November 29, 2008 when I seen this diamond and or saucer shaped black spacecraft.  It had a green light at one side a red one at the immediate opposite and an amber light on the bottom with a amber an red flashing one on what looked like the top.   When I first saw it it was headed south really slow and looked like it was gradually lowering.  Then when I pulled off the road it started to head north but the lights were still where they were at first, as if it didn’t even turn around.  So I went to my parents house down the road where I was headed anyway but when I got them to come outside it wasn’t in sight from there house and that’s where it ended.  But when I saw it moving it was way too slow to be a plane and there was no noise like a helicopter, but way too small to be a blimp.   I don’t know why either but I feel so terrified when I start to think about the thing I saw but I get a feeling that it was something threatening .   Thanks for reading my report I hope it helps solve what I seen that night.;40.9666;-81.4184999999998
