At first I thought it was an airplane simply because I live by an airport but this light was not flashing like an airplane signal light usually does, but the light I witnessed was much larger, brighter, and vividly orange.  As my curiosity grew, I opened the window and listened but there wasn't any noise whatsoever.  The light was visible for about 45 seconds to a minute and appeared to be gradually rising before disappearing into the night.
