About tw;2014-08-09 22:15:00;3 minutes;Saw several orange lights coming from the northeast going west south west.  They disappeared one by one at about the same area.  About two minutes later I saw one more on the same path, and it also dimmed and disappeared!  There was no sound.  I estimate 20 objects seen total.  They were bright orange like fire balls.   I know others must have seen.  I'm sure more reports are going to be coming in.;40.9666;-81.4184999999998
