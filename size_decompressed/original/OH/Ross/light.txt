Walked outside to have a smoke and drink some coffee and was looking up at the sky because of the clouds and the wind that was picking up a bit and all of a sudden from behind a cloud there was a very fast light that sped across the sky then disappeared.  Then as fast as it did it came right back and sped up quickly then was gone.  After I saw that I was amazed and kept looking up and maybe a min. later it came right back in a different area of the sky and zoomed across the sky and then was gone again. I waited and it never appeared again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.3183;-84.652
