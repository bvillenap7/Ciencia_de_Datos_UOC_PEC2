Strange, stationary, bright lights in Elyria, Ohio.;2012-04-19 19:00:00;ongoing;Strange, stationary, bright lights in Elyria, Ohio. This particular night I was driving home and saw “strange lights” in the sky.  No particular formation but they were different than the “weird lights” that have been spotted recently.  They were a dim orange color looking to be at varying altitudes.  They appeared to not be moving or moving very slowly. When I got home I looked up and all they were the “typical” weird lights we’ve had on and off for a while now.  Usually they are stationary they look very low, and very bright.  Sometimes they are flashing, sometimes not.  But they typically show up around nightfall and I’ve done my best for quite a while to ignore them and chalk it up to a planet or something.  There have been off times that one would shoot across the sky then stop suddenly and remain still.  I have never stayed out to watch them for longer than a few minutes here and there because I find the whole thing very uncomfortable.  I don't believe in aliens but I do find this occurance very strange and I just want to contribute if I can because the strange formation I saw while driving was very unsettling.;41.3722000000006;-82.1086999999987
