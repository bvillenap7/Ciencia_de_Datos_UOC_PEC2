Blueish-gray in color...Low rumbling sound, Moving very slow.  The size of a football field. V shaped...total of 12 lights. The object had three lights right at the very tip, shaped like a V, then there were three more lights on each side of the V.  None of the lights blinked.  Then on the wing's tips there was a light, and these would change color.  The object was moving very slowly, with a low rumbling sound.  It stopped over our house.  When it stopped you could see that the object was a blueish-gray in color.  It blended in with the sky...but the stars were so bright here tonight.  So, when it passed over us...you could not see the stars.  That's how we saw the color of the object.  The size of the object was the size of a football field.  After it paused over our house, it just kept moving very slowly in a south west direction.  The object was very low...;41.3722000000006;-82.1086999999987

Orange lights in triangular formation over Elyria, Ohio.;2012-11-21 21:05:00;2 minutes;orange lights in triangular formation over Elyria, Ohio My boyfriend was outside smoking a cigarette and called me outside.  He pointed to orange lights in the sky.  There were three lights in a triangular shape and maybe two lights on the side.  The lights were moving all together and the formation was pretty large in size.  It was hard to see through the trees but we saw it clear enough.  The lights were moving North West and disappeared completely.  We also seen at an airplane flying towards the lights.  After we no longer seen the lights, we saw a helicopter flying towards the area as well.  I tried to video tape the lights with my cell phone but could not capture the lights.  I do still have the recording though.;41.3722000000006;-82.1086999999987
