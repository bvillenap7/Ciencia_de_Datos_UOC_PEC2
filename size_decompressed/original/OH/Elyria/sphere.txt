At first I thought it was a helicopter, but the ufo was stationary.  It changes from white to green to blue to red to yellow and it wouldn't be in any certain order.  It wasnt moving.  Just sitting in the sky at a very far disctance.;41.3722000000006;-82.1086999999987
Bright amber sphere, with one smaller sphere on each side of the craft.;2016-05-30 22:15:00;1 minute;Bright amber sphere, with one smaller sphere on each side of the craft. My husband, neighbor, and myself were star gazing...Coming directly out of the west, was a bright amber sphere with one white smaller sphere on each side of the craft. There was no sound to the craft.  The altitude was 2000ft, moving very slow.  There were no navigation lights on the craft as seen on a plane (red and green).   When the craft went over head and towards the east, we could see white circular motion lights moving around the craft.  These lights were very small.  The craft moved northeast and it was gone. Description of our background:  My husband is a machinist in research and development. I'm retired from working in a biology lab.  My neighbor works in landscaping and is a Boy Scout leader.;41.3722000000006;-82.1086999999987
