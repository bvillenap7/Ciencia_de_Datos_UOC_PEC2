While walking with my son during trick or treat, I saw wat appeared to be a shooting star.  Nothing wrong with this, but about 1/2 hour later I see a formation of what appears to be 8 lights in the air spaced out independent of each other similar to a playing card 8 of diamonds.  These moved independent of each other.  It appeared to be a search team of some sort.  I was just supprised to see this type of activity after a shooting star.  The Cleveland airport is about 20 miles east of the area we were in and a small county airport for small private planes about 4 miles away.  So I am familiar with normal air traffic in the area.  I have never seen anything like this in the past.;41.3722000000006;-82.1086999999987
Very bright lighted, small hovering object seen southeast of Ohio  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2004-11-03 01:00:00;20 min.;Very bright lighted, small hovering object seen southeast of Ohio Standing in my back yard around 1:oo AM, we saw what looked like a really bright star, south east of my house. It was flickering and I thought that maybe it was just a plane or a helicopter, but it didnt get any closer or futher away from us the entire 20 minutes we were watching it. There were two small stars around it that we were comparing it to, and they didnt move at all but what we were looking at did. It would be completely still and then move left or right or in a circle, drop down or move up, it was weird.  But it didnt move from the general area that it was in. It flickered the entire time, almost like a plane but you couldnt see any definning caracteristics.Then the clouds moved in and blocked our view. And to make it even stranger, weve looked the last three nights, and it's not there anymore, so that rules out it being a star. Unless it burned out, but do they move around when they burn out.? I don't think so. This was a very weird thing that happened and now has me interested in finding out if anyone else saw it. I've seen countless shooting stars, eclipses even meteor showers but never anything like this. What we saw was in the direction of the Virginia, Pennsylvania area. Im 25 years old and my friend that saw it with me is 23. We have never saw anything like this in our lives. I mean in the entire universe there has to be something out there, and I think we may have saw it. Im not some wierdo that claims to have been abducted or had some strange encounter. Im a strong minded person and I know that what I saw wasnt a star or a plane or anything of this earth for that matter, if it was it was something Ive never seen or heard of. What we saw has enticed me to go and buy a telescope, and made somewhat of a believer of me. Ive always thought about what might be out there millions of miles away. I just hope that when we find it, we dont regret it. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.3722000000006;-82.1086999999987
((HOAX??))  There were three shapes with blinking lights northwest of where I was standing.;2016-03-28 09:34:00;5 seconds;There were three shapes with blinking lights northwest of where I was standing.  I got my camera but they were gone so i got no pictures I was sitting near a woods.  I looked northwest and saw 18 red and blue blinking lights hovering in front of us.  There was about three of them and they vanished as I pulled out my camera app on my iPhone so I got no pictures.
