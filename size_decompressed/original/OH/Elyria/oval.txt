Big red/orange lights in the sky  of Elyria;2012-10-08 20:15:00;5 minutes;big red/orange lights in the sky  of Elyria I was walking out my side door to smoke a cigarette, when I looked up into the sky in the North direction there was a big red/orange orb. then coming from the south direction, there was 3 orbs in a group like formation one behind another. going to the big orb in the North. as the orbs got close they disappeared like lights off when they got to the big orb. Then after that there was another orb coming from the south heading North as to follow the other orbs to the big orb in which the big orb is glowing bright red/orange to a dim red orange like pulsating. then there was another after that an another after that a total of ten orbs to the big orb. when i step off my patio to see where they were coming from. im looking in the  south  I couldnt see.  I got to afraid to move to far from the  house to see over my roof. at this time I yelled for my other neighbor across the street. but he didnt hear me. an by the time i got to his house it was over. but my neighbor next door which was a woman asked me what was that. and i told her I wasnt sure&quot  but they were big orbs!   Now the size of the orbs where as big as a commercial plane emitting red/orange in color. from where i was looking they were bigger then the 3 star in the sky at that time of 8:15 pm in the North west direction.  they emitted no sound an traveled quickly.  I would say the big orb was about maybe 3 miles or so a way in the North area the big one was about the size of our water tower in size of looking at the water tower close.;41.3722000000006;-82.1086999999987
