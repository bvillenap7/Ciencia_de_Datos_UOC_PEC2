It did not seem to disappear out of sight, but rather looked more or less like the fire slowly went out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Unusual movement from a red flashing light sited over Elyria, Ohio (left of the Big Dipper);2012-05-19 02:00:00;40 minutes;Unusual movement from a red flashing light sited over Elyria, Ohio (left of the Big Dipper) My fiance and I went outside at about 2:00 AM (so about an hour ago) on Saturday, May 19, 2012 after working on some art projects I've been commissioned to do.  We both wear glasses and were wearing them at the time of the siting.  We were sitting outside, talking about a new video game that we recently started playing, and disscussing my commissions.  Not too long after, we decided to go inside and get back to work, but not before I looked up at the sky.  I noticed a little blinking light in the stars.  It wasn't moving, and it didn't seem like a plane to me.  I pointed to the little blinking red light in the sky and said &quotI think that's either a satellite or a UFO&quot in a joking manner.  My fiance asked me to point out the light to him and said &quotNo, that's just a plane.  You can tell because the light's blinking red.&quot  I shook my head disapprovingly at him, as I saw the little light begin to move upward, &quotPlanes don't fly up.&quot I said to him.  I was a little bit afraid (and still am) so I wanted to go back inside.  He asked me to stay as he was really interested in it, and we sat outside watching this little light move around.  Once we accepted the possiblity of it being a UFO I waved at it and said &quothello&quot in a rather silly way.  It moved in circles, rotating around and around.  It w! ould go up, and then back down.  It seemed to me like it was trying to keep it's balance, because it seemed wobbly.  There was a round cloud around the flashing light (if I was a more educated in the fields of physics, I'd go as far to say that it looked like it might have been breaking the speed of light or sound.)  The cloud moved around with the object, and seemed to be leaving a trail behind it as it moved.  The stars next to it (it was a little to the left of the big dipper) seemed to be reflecting off of it, but that might just be my own eyes, me just being in shock.  At about 2:35 AM I looked down at my watch as my fiance reached for his phone which he ended up not having anyway.  As we sat for another five minutes, we observed that it was moving very fast.  At this point it looked like it might have been moving away from us, but I'm not entirely sure.  We were out there until about 2:40 AM when I finally convinced him to come back inside with me.  A few minutes later I decided to go outside for a few seconds and see if I could still see it, and sure enough it was still there.  Shor! tly after that I decided to come inside and write this down to see if anyone else may have seen it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Red light like fireball over Elyria Ohio;2012-06-18 21:50:00;1 minute;Red light like fireball over Elyria Ohio Went outside to get some fresh air at 9:45 pm on 6-18-12. Was facing south and just as I began to turn to go back in the house a red ball of light in the sky caught my eye.  It looked almost like a fireball and was moving rapidly to the north. It also had a glow like a cloud around it.  I went through the house to get to the front to see if I could still see it but it had already gone behind the trees.;41.3722000000006;-82.1086999999987
Firey orange orbs right over us!;2012-08-25 21:30:00;15 minutes;firery orange orbs right over us! My kids and were outside around 9:30 when we seen a firery orange object flying toward us. It came in very fast and with no sound then just seemed to hover right over us at no more than 200 feet high. When it passed by the light went out and all we could see then was a black orb moving away. Within a few mins, 3 more came towards us in s straight line formation moving south to north. All 3 had the lights go out too, and 1 even took a nose dive of sorts and seemed to have landed in the field or woods across the street. Going to look for it today.;41.3722000000006;-82.1086999999987
Bright orange orb, dropping flare like flashes in Northeastern sky, changed direction and faded into high altitude.;2013-09-14 17:15:00;2 minutes;Bright orange orb, dropping flare like flashes in Northeastern sky, changed direction and faded into high altitude. Around 9:15PM on 09/14/2013 while on my back patio I noticed a very bright orange orb in the northeastern sky.  It appeared to be moving west towards myself. I watched it for just a few seconds when I saw what looked like a little orange teardrop melt off the bottom of it, that then evaporated.  I immediately thought it was some kind of comet that was burning away. I ran inside and grabbed my cellphone to capture a video.  I began to film it for a few seconds and noticed it was was moving straight north now and seemed to have been gaining altitude very very quickly.  I observed a few more melting drops during this period until it completely disappeared from view in the northern sky.  I did see the object flash two more melting drops from it at this point, although I could not see the object itself.  During my entire viewing of this object there was no noise coming from it.  I have a minute long cell phone video in which the object is visible in less detail, although a flare drop can be seen.;41.3722000000006;-82.1086999999987
We went out the door and we saw a Fireball same size as the moon moving at approximately 5 miles an hour up in the sky in front of us.;2015-09-05 21:15:00;4 minutes;We went out the door and we saw a Fireball same size as the moon moving at approximately 5 miles an hour up in the sky in front of us.   Suddenly, it stopped and started blinking different colors around it.  It stood still for like 15 seconds.  Then it continued moving forward and it diminished to the size of a star until it disappeared.  It look like it came in and out of the Earth's atmosphere.;41.3722000000006;-82.1086999999987
