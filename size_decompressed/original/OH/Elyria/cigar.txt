ufo flies over head and chased by military jet;2018-06-26 19:00:00;3 hours;ufo flies over head and chased by military jet 3 friends and I were driving home from the store at around 8pm on a summer night. The moon was coming up and I was watching it through the window of the car. I saw a bright light next to it that would grow in size and flash different colors. I pointed it out to the rest of my friends and they were all immediately intrigued. Once we arrived home we stood outside and watched as more formed in the sky. One of my friends was uninterested and went in the house to begin cooking dinner for the rest of us. We watched for another hour or so and then a large cigar shaped spacecraft came flying from across the street. It was low in the sky. It flew towards us and right above our heads for and stoped for a seconds. It had windows and white and red lights all across it. We watched as it was right above us now. then it took off so fast and climbed higher in the sky. The craft was dead silent but then a rumbling sound began. From across the street (the direction the craft ! came from) a military jet flew past us and after the craft that was still rising. We watched them get higher in the sky and then the jet turned around and flew back. It was dark now but we watched this bright flashing light move around the sky. It seemed to have no direction and would move up and down for seemingly no reason. One of my friends went in around 30 minutes later so there was only 2 of us left. 10 minutes later the entire sky turned white like lightning and it lasted for a split second. When to sky turned to its normal color again all the stars and the craft were no longer visible;41.3722000000006;-82.1086999999987
