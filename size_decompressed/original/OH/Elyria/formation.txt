Large triangle escorted by 35-40 crafts.;2020-05-24 23:05:00;45 seconds;Large triangle escorted by 35-40  crafts My wife and I were stargazing, looking north to the Big Dipper. At first we saw several white orbs we thought were Starlink (which we have seen before).  But, to our surprise a beam of light, a rod, which was a pinkish rose color appeared. From this rod came 2 sets of 3 ships followed by a large triangle. The triangle blended in the sky, but it was darker in color. Each tip had a blue or white light on it.  There was no sound. We knew we were looking at something so large because it blocked out the stars, especially the handle on the Big Dipper. The smaller crafts were in groups of 3-4 surrounding the large triangle.  The color of lights or orbs were white, dark red, and amber. The crafts appeared to be escorting the triangle. At the back of the triangle, there were 2 different crafts. One was a rod with green light in the front and red light in the back. The other craft was a large orb. The colors were orange and amber.  This orb rolled like a ball. The crafts came out of the southwest and turned towards the northeast. There was no vapor trail or sound.  All of the crafts kept up at the same speed.
