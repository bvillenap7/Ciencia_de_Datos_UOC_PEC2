Unidentified flying objects seen from the lake shore at Bay Village, Ohio, July 5, 2014 at approx. 10:30 p.m.;2014-07-05 23:00:00;20 minutes;Unidentified flying objects seen from the lake shore at Bay Village, Ohio, July 5, 2014, at approx. 10:30 p.m. At approx. 10:30-11pm. while looking out of my 4th floor large bay window & skylight that overlooks Lake Erie, I suddenly saw reddish glowing circular objects approaching from the west in pairs of twos and fours.  They appeared to fly around in unison, in a geometric formation of sorts.   During the twenty minutes I watched as though an entire linear formation cruised by the lake front and seemed to be flying somewhere between as low as 1,000 feet above the lake, to as high as 3,000 feet as they departed moving Northward out over the lake.   I opened my window to see if I could hear an engine or any sound and there was absolute silence in the sky during the time the objects were visible.  FYI, I'm a college graduate, the daughter of a retired Neurosurgeon and a 58-year-old mother of of two grown children.  My observations are simply an objective report of my experience.;41.4851999999999;-81.9292
