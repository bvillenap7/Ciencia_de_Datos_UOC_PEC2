At first I thought that it could be some sort of air balloon as they were not making any noise. They were traveling at a speed of approximately 2 times what I would expect from an aircraft traveling at the same height.  Then I looked up and there were two more, then two more then one more.  This continued for a total of 16 sightings. There may have been more prior to the first sighting. I waited several more minutes to see if there would be more but that was all there were.
