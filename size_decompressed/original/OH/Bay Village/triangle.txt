I saw a bright light shining down thru the trees. I though it was a helicopter for our local hospital that transports patients from the community campus to their main campus. But this light was bright and shining down.  I then thought perhaps it was a police helicopter looking for someone but in our area, I have never seen that happen. Then I saw the red lights, several of them.  I called for my husband that ran outside with me. We saw several triangles in formation.  The last light was red and appeared to be trailing behind the others that were in formation. I would have to guess that there were 7 objects that each had a formation of three lights that were at the front of the craft. Because you are in shock when you see something like this, we stood there for a moment.  Then I ran in and got my Cannon camera and was able to capture at least one of the objects on video. The entire time took maybe 5 minutes, maybe a little longer. They were coming from the South and heading across the Lake. Another person in a nearby city also reported the same thing we saw. I have a video to share.;41.4851999999999;-81.9292

As pulled out of my driveway and headed down the street, I noticed a glowing red light in the distance.  I thought it was a drone.   As we drove to the end of the Street the object had moved East and was hovering over a wooded area by the railroad tracks, about 15 yards away.   We stopped and pulled over as there were now three lights that appeared on the triangle object.  Red, green, and white.  It would blink one light at a time changing color and then they would all turn red.  Then only the center light would glow bright red.   Out of nowhere we saw two more of these crafts.  They made no sound at all and had little to no movement.  We watched for about ten minutes.   I am not sure how long these crafts were in the area, as we had to go, but it was something I cannot explain.;41.4851999999999;-81.9292
