There were intensely bright lights about the height of stadium lights in a place where no stadium existed.;1999-12-02 02:00:00;10 minutes;There were intensely bright lights about the height of stadium lights in a place where no stadium existed. I am a retired military officer, trained in both intelligence and contracting.  I do not make any conclusions about things until I have reviewed them as thoroughly as possible.  This incident was particularly unnerving, though.  I was driving home from shopping at an all night supermarket and noticed some very bright lights ahead about the height and intensity of stadium lights.  That location did not have any such lights so I presumed some may have been added.  The night was very dark - I don't recall if it were overcast or just dark, but I could not see anything but this panel of lights in the distance.  As I neared the lights, which were just barely to my left and very high I looked out my window and tried to see them better.  When I looked up it seemed as if I were looking at the bottom of something, but I couldn't tell because it was so dark.  I could not even make out a shape I only could see this row of lights and darkness behind them.  I drove by very slowly with the window down.  No noise and no movement came from it.  I decided to come back the next day to see why/where lights had been erected.  I drove to my home in the town up the road.  As I drove up the cross street to my street I was shocked to see these same lights moving very slowly up my street, perpendicular to my car.  They were about 20 feet in the air they clearly were not on the ground.  I stopped the car, opened the window and turned off the car lights and engine.  I watched these strange lights go to the end of my street, across the street I was on, and continue over the field on the other side.  The object produced no sound at all the entire time I watched it.  I was totally spooked by this time and drove into my garage as quickly as I could.  The next day I went back to where I thought lights had been erected and found nothing but an empty field with a few trees.  Strangely enough, three months later I came down with cancer.  Years later I was watching a UFO report where an entire town sited a UFO.  They cont! acted a nearby air traffic controller who could not see the UFO on radar, but could see it with his naked eyes.  The description the controller gave of the lights and the representative drawing showing the orientation of the lights were identical to what I saw.

3 foot humaniod on back porch, 10 foot or so dark metal triangle in woods, talking to a religious pastor.;2006-01-21 00:00:00;All day;3 foot humaniod on back porch, 10 foot or so dark metal triangle in woods, talking to a religious pastor. Around 1:00am i woke up, i was very disoriented and sick to the stomach, took me a good hour to sleep. Over the rest of the day i have had multiple unexplained bizzare sightings and apparitions. 7:00am, wake-up for morning shower before work, it is still very dark and i spot a small figure move across my back porch (it is an outdoor porch), it was approx. 3 feet in size. I was so frightened by the figure i locked myself in my basement room. No windows or ways to peek in. Around 7:30am, i hear unexplained noises,  anywhere from a bang to a boom to a loud ring in only 1 ear. 2:00pm, i wasnt so phased by the figure anymore, but i decided to drive to a friend's house on the outskirts of the city. As i am driving, i see a large diamond shaped light come from a patch of woods off New Trebien Road, the light proceeded to fade and  i could spot movement towards the car, it had a dark dark graphite type of texture and color, the object moved away from the car and disappeared into the woods. 2:30pm, i arrive at my friends and we talk about the strange appearances. By the time i leave around, 4:00am the next morning, me and my friend arrive at my home at 4:30 or 40. BAM, that little figure appears at 7:00am right on the dot. My T.V. goes haywire, the only thing that happens from then on is us getting in my car, driving 2 miles out of town, stopping, puking and proceeding to the nearest church i can find. I speak to the pastor at the church at 8:00am and he tells me bad things are to do with that house, but this did not have me and my friend convinced. So here i am at 12:00 noon, writing this looking for some sort of explaination on the weird and frightening appearances. Is this only the beginning of these odd appearances? I pray i never see a little 3 foot pygmy on my back porch ever again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Pulsing glow of light dancing over WPAFB;2009-09-17 01:00:00;10 mins;Pulsing glow of light dancing over WPAFB It was about 0100 and I just got home after visiting with some friends.  As I was walking towards my front door I noticed something moving in the sky.  At first I thought it might have been a meteorite because my initial glance of the object was a fast streak of white light across the sky and then it faded out to black.  I then, noticed, that the object reappeared as bright as it was before.  It was like nothing I have ever seen.  The way it turned, the speed at which it accelerated, and the fact that it was completely soundless was all the proof I needed to assume it was not man-made!  I have been around military Aircraft my whole life, and this was NOT one of ours!  I stared at it for about ten minutes before it slowly disintegrated.  The entire time it just danced effortlessly across a patch of sky fading in and out of visibility directly above WPAFB. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
