It would be best described;1999-02-28 18:00:00;3 minutes;((NUFORC:  Address indicated by author, 30FE99, is illogical.)) Approximately 500ft. in the air, just below a low cloud line, I saw a small grey spherical object hovering.  It would be best described as looking like a soccerball with flat sides. On 2/30/99, at 6:00p.m. I was driving my car and coming up to a stop sign.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed something dark grey in the sky.  (It was an overcast sky with about a 500ft. ceiling.)  At first I thought it was a bird or an airplane but when I took a second look, I realized it was niether of those possibilities.  I live a stone's throw away from Wright-Patterson AFB so I thought it may have been a weather balloon or possibly a kite or kids helium baloon.  I don't think it was any of these because it was not moving or rotating.  I was close enough to it to see that it was approximately 3ft. in diameter, spherical, with flat sides (not shiny).  It looked like something you would see on Star Wars used as a probe.  I studied it for about 30 seconds before someone pulled up behind me waiting to turn.  I headed east to get a better look.  I could see it through the tree lines and was anxiously driving to a clear spot.  When I arrived at an open clearing, about 3 blocks away and 1 minute later, it was gone. The day was overcast with little wind.  It was also raining a bit and had been doing so for most of the day.  This would discount the possibility of it being a kite unless we have the second coming of Ben Franklin.  There was also no thunderstorm activity in the area.  Secondly, it was not a balloon because the slight breeze would have moved it.  The clouds were moving around it but it was dead still. I did not hear any noise either. I was also close enough (500ft.) to see that it had two cylindrical objects sticking out of the side, side by side (almost looking like a nose).  I would say they were about the size of pop cans.  I did chase up and down the streets loking for a kid or someone in the rain reeling in a kite but found noone.;39.8025999999999;-84.0153999999987
Saw a very bright streak of light at about 500-1,000ft altitude with bright multicolored flashes of light emmiting from it. Estimated s;1999-11-16 19:05:00;45-60 seconds;Saw a very bright streak of light at about 500-1,000ft altitude with bright multicolored flashes of light emmiting from it. Estimated speed of object around 75-100mph, and estimated length of the object at around 300-1,000ft. A neighbor witnessed the object with me and said it could not have been a meteor because it was traveling too slow and did not burn up. Also it was brighter and more colorful than any shooting star I've ever witnessed. Witnessed object for about 45-60 seconds. Saw a very bright streak of white light with bright multicolored flashes of light emmiting from the entire length of the object. I would estimate that the object was at about 1,000ft altitude, with the length of the object at around 300-1,000ft, and estimated speed of the object at around 75-100mph. I first saw the light through some tree branches and thought someone was lighting fireworks off. Then when the object passed a tree where I could get a look at it I said what in the world is that? because my neighbor was getting out of his car. When he witnessed the object, he said are we seeing ufo's or something? He dismissed the object as being a meteor because it was moving so slow, and because it was fairly close to the ground. The object went right over Wright Patterson AFB and continued in a north-westerly direction.;39.8025999999999;-84.0153999999987
Three UFO's in triangle formation over the WPAFB sky.;2013-12-31 23:40:00;10 seconds;Three UFO's in triangle formation over the WPAFB sky. This was shortly before the new year begun about 11:40 P.M.  I had walked out of the bar and was crossing the street when I looked up and saw three red shaped objects in the sky.  They were very small because they were at a great distance.  They were in a right triangle formation and none of the lights were pulsating lights.   What got me was that they were all stationary, they did not move and like I said they were in a triangle formation with a lot of space between them.  It did not look like they were real close to each other.   I continued walking across the street and a few minutes later when I walked back I did not see them in the sky at all.  I had been drinking that night but I didn't have that much at all.   I know what I saw.  I could see all the stars and then these three red lights stood out right in the middle of them.  I'm 21 and I've never seen UFO's before but on December 31, 2013, shortly before midnight I saw what I saw.;39.8025999999999;-84.0153999999987
Black tube descending from sky to ground.;2014-02-12 17:00:00;2 hours;Black tube descending from sky to ground There was a black/gray tube that extended from the sky to the ground.  Same diameter throughout, but had a curve or bend in it towards the top.  Couldn't see through it and was there for at least two hours.  It was off in the distance, but seemed to have a large diameter, at least three to four cars wide.  Could have been much larger close up.  Was seen from major highway, I-675 near the 235 exit heading south.  Never seen anything like it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.

4 bright orange lights in the sky.;2016-07-10 22:07:00;>2;4 bright orange lights in the sky.  10 July 2016.    At approximately 2207 westwardly in the sky at about 2 o'clock from the moon appeared 4 very bright orange lights in a sort of parallelogram shape.  They were differently in the lower atmosphere.  They moved across the sky at 3 o'clock from the moon.  They did not keep the parallelogram shape but instead 3 lined up like a back lash (\) with the fourth one behind them  (.\)   One by one they slowly faded out and disappeared in the night sky.  The whole thing only last about 2 minutes.   Posted sighting on social media to see if others saw it.   Was told they were Chinese memorial lanterns, but I have doubts. I have a BA in Humanities.;39.8025999999999;-84.0153999999987
