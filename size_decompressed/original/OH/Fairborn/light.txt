They appeared to be moving north in more or less a straight line, but not close together.  I observed them for a few seconds, went to my door, and called my wife to come out.  When I looked back up, two of the lights had disappeared.  My wife and I both saw the remaining two lights for a few seconds.  My wife returned to the house, and I saw one of the lights fade out--the fading out was rapid, and I couldn't tell if it passed behind some clouds or simply went out. I then went back into the house.  At first I thought they might be some sort of fireworks--it was new years, but they seemed to move slowly and in a very orderly way.  They didn't blink, and I couldn't see any other lights--like an aircraft might have, for example.  I've never seen any aircraft lights that color.;39.8025999999999;-84.0153999999987
4 orange/yellow bright lights /spheres in a cluster. 2 travelling together in a pattern then separating. 3-4 minutes.;2014-04-05 21:50:00;3-4 minutes;4 orange/yellow bright lights /spheres in a cluster. 2 travelling together in a pattern then separating. 3-4 minutes My daughter and I were driving from Downtown Fairborn, Ohio, on Saturday evening, 4/5/2014 to our home.   As we entered a more rural area my daughter noticed 4 bright lights in the sky.  They were orange/yellow, very bright.  My daughter thought that they were hot air balloons or lanterns, and asked if you could release lanterns in the sky.   I looked over and saw them, but was unable to pull to the side of the road at that time as there was a car directly behind me.  At first I thought it may be a plane, as 2 of the lights seemed to be travelling together, and remained parallel and equal distance apart, similar to lights on a large plane.  I told her that it was a strange color but I was sure that it was a large plane from WPAFB as the lights were travelling together and appeared to be turning together.  Then the lights split.   Her phone would not video while we were moving.  I drove into a subdivision where we could stop and get out, by then there were 2 lights left to be seen.   We got a picture from her phone, then the lights were all gone.  They were not moving like a meteor of falling star.  Two were originally close to each other then split while the two others were farther away, but still all four were somewhat in a cluster.   I have never seen lights in the sky move like this, or this color.   We were unable to see a shape other than a round bright sphere, lights moving in unison and then separating, then disappearing.   I might add my father was an Air Force pilot, and I have lived on or near bases my whole life.   But these lights did not act like meteors, or planes and they disappeared while in the sky.;39.8025999999999;-84.0153999999987
Blinking lights that move suddenly in the sky.;2015-09-21 00:15:00;hours;blinking lights that move suddenly in the sky A strange blinking light very high in the atmosphere has been noticed in the northeast part of the sky on several nights.  The light hovers and moves very quickly up and down in the sky.  I have also observed it seeming to come in closer and dim out away very suddenly.  It is much higher altitudes than the airplanes flying around.  I have noticed it there several times lately over the past week.  It doesn't move like any aircraft I've ever seen in the sky.;39.8025999999999;-84.0153999999987
