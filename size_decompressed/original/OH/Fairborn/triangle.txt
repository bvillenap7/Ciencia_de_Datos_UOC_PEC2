On this evening I was outside to make weather observations while attempting to capture the intense lightning with my digital camera (Sony Cyber-shot DSC P-150).  The camera is capable of 7.2 mega pixels but was set to 3.0 mega pixels when this picture was taken.  All other settings were set to normal or default. While facing toward the southeast an object of light came into my field of vision on the left.  I looked up and took one picture of three white lights (twice the size of an average star).  The lights were in a triangular shape, 60 to 75 degrees above the horizon, and were moving toward the east-south east.  The ceiling was between 1000k -2000k feet. The object was in view and passed silently overhead for about 10 seconds to 20 seconds before disappearing into the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and he seemed to us to be an exceptionally capable observer.  The object, he reported, was below almost solid overcast, and the weather conditions were so severe that it would be unusual to see an aircraft flying in that area, the witness reported.

Black Triangle Clearly Spotted In Ohio;2006-09-05 21:00:00;about 30 seconds;Black Triangle Clearly Spotted In Ohio Sometime in the fall of 2006 around 9 p.m. I went out back to lock up the garage for the night. It was a cool, clear, pleasant evening so I stood outside in the back yard for a minute or two enjoying the breeze and looking at the stars. It was very dark outside, except for the normal lights associated with houses and streetlights. Living right next to an air force base, I also have the occasion to see and hear many planes everyday, and for a while that is exactly what I thought this object was. As I am standing there, I see what appears to be a white and bluish-to bluish-green light each one flashing alternately very close together way  in the distance up in the sky. At this point I could not see anything structural, it was at a very far distance at this point.  I do not know if this was the top, bottom, or side of the object which had the flashing lights. My first impression was that they were the lights you would normally associate with airplanes sometimes as they come in for a landing. Something about them seemed unusual to me the weird blue color wasn’t what I was used to seeing, and the speed of the strobe was way off. The flashing lights were much faster and also much brighter than I have ever seen on any airplane.  I stood there watching it out of curiosity at that point, thinking that naturally if it is a plane, it’s heading for the Air Force base, and that meant it would have to generally head in a direction and path that was familiar to me from watching airplanes take off and land in the same place for years.  I thought this might afford me a better look at what kind of airplane it was. As it kept getting closer, I thought for sure that it was going to head toward the base, but instead of turning toward the base, it was proceeding directly toward my general location. When it got within my field of vision and I could make it out clearly,  I could only see the bottom of the object, and the outline of the overall shape, which was triangular, and the color of the triangle was a non-reflective black. It was so black that I could make it out against the contrast of the night sky. The white and bluish lights were not flashing or blinking at this time that I could see, but there were lights on the bottom of the object. A small, round, white light was in each corner of the triangular shaped object, with a larger red light in the center of it, which may have been concave. The white lights on the tips of the triangle remained constant, they did not flash or dim , however the red light in the middle seemed to glow or pulse very slowly.  At this point I still did not completely understand what I was looking at, because it was flying very low, lower than airplanes are allowed to fly, I know that.  And it was moving very slowly in a perfectly horizontal fashion. The smooth slow glide of the object put me in the mind of the idea of pushing something heavy on the ice and watching it slowly glide across in a level straight line.  That it what this object appeared to do .  It passed overhead maybe one or two houses east of my location, but nearly directly overhead. It had to be less than 300’ ft in the air, it was so close I felt like I could have hit it with a rock, had I thrown one at it.  As it glided over the houses, I opened the gate and quickly walked to the front yard to continue observing the object. It just continued in a level, straight line in a southeasterly direction, and I observed it until it was out of sight, about 30 seconds to a minute I would say total observation from the time I could first visually make it out until the time that it was out of  my field of vision. I kept thinking that something wasn’t right, and it wasn’t until it was almost out of sight that I realized that not only had it passed lower and slower than any airplane I had ever seen, but it also never made any noise at all. None. Not a single rumble, vibration or hum. Completely silent.   When it was out of sight, I went back into the house. I thought I might hear something about other people sighting the same thing, but nothing was ever mentioned by anyone or any news organization as far as I know. I am an ordained minister, and stay at home dad. I don’t want any trouble or publicity, I just wanted to tell the truth about what I saw.

Triangle craft over I-70 on June 27th, and 4:30 AM, near Fairborn, OH;2009-06-27 04:30:00;5 minutes;Triangle craft over I-70 on June 27th, and 4:30 AM, near Fairborn, OH Had just turned onto I 70 East from 675, when I saw 3 white lights ahead. My first thought was that it was a jet from Wright-Patt, which was only a few miles away. When I first saw them, the lights were pretty much in a straight line, and probably twice tree top height. As I continued, it became apparent that I was looking at a triangle UFO)- one light at the front, and the other two on the sides. Having grown up in Dayton, I know that this had no colored wingtip lights. I could then see a slowly blinking red light on the bottom (it was dark and I could not make out the actual form. I continued driving and rolled down my window to see if I could hear a jet engine- no, only wind and road noise. Looking up, when the red light came on, I could see the solid flat, dark surface of the area right behind the light. I rolled up my window and then caught a glimps of the craft in my rear view mirror. I could see two red lights on the back end. The craft was right over the median grass strip of the highway, moving East to West, very slowly. Size-wise, it would have been the size of one of the C-5A cargo jets that Wright-Patt has on base. No way this was one of those, which I've seen for years and years, practicing touch and gos at the base. I'm neither shocked nor surprised- nice to have finally seen one of these, and I look forward to some type of disclousure;39.8025999999999;-84.0153999999987

It was a V-shaped craft with 2 white lights on both wings and 1 white light in the front.;2019-08-30 00:15:00;60 seconds;I was driving a truck from Cincinnati, Oh., to London, Oh., northbound on 675N getting onto 70W at time of encounter, several miles west of Wright Patt AFB.  This occurred on 8/30/19 approx. 12:15am.  The entire sighting lasted maybe a minute.   When I first noticed the object it appeared to be low in the night sky as I was driving on 675N it was crossing my truck from east to west.  It was a V-shaped craft with 2 white lights on both wings and 1 white light in the front and 1 flashing red light behind the front light.  It made a wide U-shaped flight pattern and came back towards my truck while descending,   At first, I thought it was going back to WPAFB to make a landing, but it just kept dropping down and then I thought it might be crashing.  But the craft came to a stop just over top of the tree line next to the 70W freeway.  It stayed there for the remainder of the time motionless as I was driving past it getting onto the 70W interstate.   I stuck my head out of my passenger side window to look at the bottom of the craft and it was in a wing shape and appeared to be black on the bottom.  I didn't hear any noise coming from it, but I was in a tractor trailer, so hard to tell if it was making any noise.
