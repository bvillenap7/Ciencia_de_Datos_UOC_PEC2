Strange blue flash over WPAFB;2012-07-02 23:00:00;1-2 seconds;Strange blue flash over WPAFB My wife and I were headed down St RT 444 when we saw a brilliant deep blue flash of light that was almost blinding.  The light itself seemed unnatural... almost like it had a &quotthickness&quot to it if that makes any sense.  The sky was clear and we immediately checked our local news weather app on her phone and there were no storms anywhere near the area.  I immediately called my friend who was on the other side of town and before I could tell him anything he began describing the same thing only he claimed to have seen a blue spherical shape in the sky.  Upon arriving home I looked in the sky to find what appeared to be a contrail visible in the moonlight heading straight up and then suddenly making a hard ninety degree turn across the sky.  I should disclose that the road my wife and I were on is where a majority of the base gates are for Wright-Patterson AFB.;39.8025999999999;-84.0153999999987
My daughter and I saw a bright flash of exploding light in the sky over Fairborn, Ohio.;2013-09-27 23:45:00;2-3 minutes;My daughter and I saw a bright flash of exploding light in the sky over Fairborn, Ohio. On the way driving home to Xenia from Fairborn (Ohio) my daughter and I saw a flash of light that we thought was a sudden strike of lightning.  It was very bright and sudden, and there was no storm – It startled us both.  We looked up out of the window and there was a white cloud-like trail in the sky that lingered for about 2-3 minutes before dissipating.  It was very strange.  I rarely see lightning that bright – It lit up the entire area around us! I am pretty certain that it was an explosion of some sort.  I called my sister who was also driving home on the same road, and she said that she and her boyfriend had seen it as well.  About 15 minutes later, she called me back and said that they had just seen a second flash of light.;39.8025999999999;-84.0153999999987
