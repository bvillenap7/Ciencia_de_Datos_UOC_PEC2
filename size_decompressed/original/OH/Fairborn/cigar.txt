Metallic Pill Shaped UFO flys overhead at park near Wright Patterson Air Force Base.;2016-08-04 19:53:00;30 seconds;Metallic Pill Shaped UFO flys overhead at park near Wright Patterson Air Force Base. I was at Maplewood Park in Fairborn, Ohio, with my girlfriend on the swings. I looked up and saw a shiny, pill shaped UFO fly overhead.  It was completely silent and looked like it was really high in the air.  I thought it was really odd to see an object flying so high in the air, not making nay noise, and it was metallic.   So I pulled out my cell phone and started recording right away.  It went straight, at a steady pace, looked like it was floating across the sky.  My girlfriend and I just watched it and kept swinging. I'm not sure what I saw that day, maybe it was a satellite or a blimp.  It makes me wonder because I was only a comple miles away from Wright-Patt Air Force Base.  I lost sight of the object when it flew out of distance and on the other side of the tree.  The object was flying from North to South.  I was facing East when I noticed and recorded the UFO.;39.8025999999999;-84.0153999999987
