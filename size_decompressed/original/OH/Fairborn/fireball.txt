UFO above Fairborn Ohio no noise and not man made.;2012-08-07 23:00:00;15 seconds;UFO above Fairborn Ohio no noise and not man made. Sitting out in my backyard and was grilling out. I looked up and seen a glowing what appeared to be a fire ball.  It was moving from south to west, slowly with no noise.  It appeared to stop moving and hover in one spot for a short time the turned, went a short distance then appeared to burn out.  Shortly after that a second &quotburning fireball&quot came out of the sky and behaved the same as the first.  About 30 minutes later, we saw what looked like a flashing strobe light moving in a random, zig-zag pattern coming from the north and moving south at a very high speed. It was gone in a matter of ten seconds or so, it flew across the sky with no noise and at a speed that was never seen before by a man made machine.  I still can not believe what we seen in the sky, it was kind of scary!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Strange fireball floated into sky and shot up and dissapeard near wpafb in fairborn;2014-01-09 11:20:00;2 minutes;Strange fireball floated into sky and shot up and dissapeard near wpafb in fairborn Was looking out my bay window while closing the curtains when I noticed this big bright orange ball of light lift into the sky slowly and went above my house.   I ran to the other side of my house and out the back door to watch it as it climbed some distance into the sky and hovered for about 30 seconds.  It suddenly shot up into the air and the light got dimmer and dimmer until it was a pin point into the sky.   There was no noise coming from the object so I defiantly know it could have not been a helicopter or airplane.   Freaked me out.  I live right by wright pat air force base here in Dayton.   I am hoping that there is some explanation for what I saw tonight.;39.8025999999999;-84.0153999999987
