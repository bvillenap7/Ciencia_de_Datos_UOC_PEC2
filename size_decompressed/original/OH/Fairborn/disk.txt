Possible saucer near Wright Patt AFB.;2017-03-23 20:05:00;20:15;Possible saucer near Wright Patt AFB I was talking a walk through a neighborhood in Fairborn, OH, (near Wright Patterson AFB), when I noticed something flying overhead to the north.  My friend and I watched it for a few minutes.  It has a white light in the center and light blue and green lights on the perimeter.   The craft flew in a straight line east to west, then made an aprupt 90Â° turn to the left (south) without stopping or slowing.  The craft made several other adjustments like this over the next few minutes.  The craft also was doing up and down in altitude.  After several minutes, it appeared to lower in height then disappeared.   To be honest, I thought it was a drone at first, but there was a moment when it turned and it looked like a saucer.  Still could have been a quadchopper drone, but I've never seen a drone with this color configuration.  Not to mention, I thought there were laws regulating drone lights.  Fairborn is a busy city near Dayton and borders Wright Patt AFB, so making an illegal brine ((sic.  flight??)) would be brash. Feel free to contact via my email address listed below.
