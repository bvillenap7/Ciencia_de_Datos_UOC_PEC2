My daughter and I were driving, and a very bright pink light appeared in the sky. I immediately pulled over and we were both saying “what is that?” It was still and very bright, the color of a flare but the light was massive. We were in the middle of the country. As soon as I pulled my phone out to take a picture it disappeared. It didn’t trail off, it was like it vanished into thin air. We were both in shock and couldn’t move while it was visible. I’ve never seen anything like it. I hope that others saw this too.;40.9640999999999;-81.6837999999995
