Location: Route 21, aprox. 6 miles south of Route 76/224. Near Doylestown Ohio. Our backyard Weather conditions:  bright blue sky, slightly hazy. Viewed by me and my husband. I was watching white smoke trail upwards into the sky, when I saw a tiny bright object was that was quickly moving east. Without the contrast-filtering of the white smoke, I probably would not have noticed because of itâ€™s size, and the bright sky. The object appeared more round, and reminded me of a night star, or satellite. It was almost directly above us, in the 1:00 position. Note: We live about 22 miles from the Akron-Canton airport, so I am well familiar with seeing various aircraft, and the speeds they travel. Nothing can change course as we witnessed. It appeared to slow, and I  called to my husband to look. It then appeared to dtop and hover. At that point, we said it must be a weather or party balloon. Seconds later, it made a sharp left turn to the north, and accelerated in speed. My husband lost track of it, but I followed it to approximately the 10:00 position, where it simply blinked out of sight. I watched for moments after, scanning the sky, but it was gone.  .;40.9640999999999;-81.6837999999995
