I saw a very bright blue light hover over the town then shoot up and to the North at a great speed. Hover time approximately 6 seconds. It made a meteor type streak as it ascended. There was cloud cover at the time and I have never seen a meteor move at an upward angle. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date.  PD));40.9640999999999;-81.6837999999995
