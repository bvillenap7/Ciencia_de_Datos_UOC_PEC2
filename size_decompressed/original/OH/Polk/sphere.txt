Bright strange moving light.;2016-10-08 21:30:00;30 seconds;Bright strange moving light Oct 8, 2016.  I was locked out of my house and car waiting for police to arrive.  I was standing in my yard in a very rural area, mostly Amish neighbors, no street lights, rarely see cars come down the road.   It was very dark and I was looking to the west waiting to see headlights of the police car I was expecting, when I saw a very bright, large ball of yellow light outlined with a thin green light in the sky.  It fell straight down rather slow, much slower than meteors I have seen before.  It fell for a couple seconds then paused briefly.  It then took a sharp right turn. traveling north in a straight line, then shot rapidly down and to the left in a slightly curved trajectory and then shot straight away moving west, directly away from me.  The entire event took 4-6 seconds with the initial falling and pause lasting more than 80% of the duration of the sighting.  The last half of the sighting was very fast.;40.9349;-82.2074
