Possible ufo sighting over Licking County.;2018-03-19 23:12:00;2 minutes;Possible ufo sighting over licking county Evening of March 19th, time exactly I would say 11:12 pm est,  was haveing a smoke at my patio door  very dark night mostly cloudy to cloudy conditions low cloud bank between 10 to 15 thousand feet the object I saw and in question I saw was moving slowly west stopped shot back to the east then west looked yellowish green in color to me being it was cloudy there were no stars or planets visible at the time caught a 20 second video of the object in question watched the video in the video u can see it in the video when it moved back west it was fast the went straight up in the low clouds first thought was a flare or a firework was not the case no noise do not believe it was a plane or helicopter to cloudy to see so it was not a satellite or the iss but clearly caught something in the 20 second video u can decide looking for yourself thought it was worth report to for your attention on this subject!! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, who sounded to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  We received a video, but there is nothing distinct enough in it for us to be able to conclude what the object was.  PD));40.0731520851813;-82.4016850931689
