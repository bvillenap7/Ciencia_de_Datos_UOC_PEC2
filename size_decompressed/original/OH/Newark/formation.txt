But in the distance i could see a set of lights near or on the top of another hill.....i once again assumed it was just a house with the lights on, but as we coasted down the hill i noticed that the position of the lights were moving vertically in comparison to us as we made our way down the hill.....at this point i had stoppd the car and rolled down the window to look more clearly .....what i saw at first was just what appeared to be a disk with a very low intensity orangish light emmiting from the entire craft....but just as soon as i focused in on it the object began to move diagonaly towards the feild below...as it moved the orange glow slowly faded to white and then the light seperated itself int seven seperate light orbs that pulsed..now from the angle i was at i could not see it all to well now.....so i went to drive the car around the corner but the car had turned itself off. the key was still in the ignition and i attempted to restart it but there was no resonse. even the electronics were unresponsive...now at this time i looked back up and saw that the object moved over towards my car......not over top of me but close enough....at this time i realized it was not a disk because even though the lights where in a disk shape formation, when it crossed paths with the moon you could see the moon in the center of all the lights....as the lights began to ascend upwards, the lights slowley turned orange once again........then out of no where my car started........when i looked back up at the object it was a brite violet and it took of.......my radio did not work for weeks after the inccident.............when i went home ! every cl ock had said it was 10:52........but both my car and cellphone clock read 22 minutes faster....;40.0731520851813;-82.4016850931689
