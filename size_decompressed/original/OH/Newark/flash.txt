Bright flash over central Ohio.;2019-03-28 04:30:00;15 seconds;Bright flash over Central Ohio Around 4:30AM on Thursday March 28, I saw a bright red flash directly overhead at about my 12 o'clock.  Several seconds passed and I expected to see another flash as if it were an airplane, but it took almost 10 seconds before I saw another super bright red flash in the western sky.  There was no sound.   I have seen many meteors and know what the planets look like.  I am actively interested in avaition and can identify most types of planes.  I have seen a day time fireball and this was not that as it was a bright flash.  It did not intensify like an Iridium satellite, or reentry of space junk.  For 30 years, I have been looking at the sky and this one has me stumped.;40.0731520851813;-82.4016850931689
