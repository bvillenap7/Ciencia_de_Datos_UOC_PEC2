Large Cigar shaped object (newark Ohio);2002-01-09 10:00:00;2 min;Large Cigar shaped object (newark Ohio) I was driving down I-70 east just short of the newark exit. Off to the left there was a cellphone/radio tower. about a half mile northwest of the tower aprox. 150 ft in the air I observed a cigar shaped craft hoviering in place. It did not move a inch for the time W was on the side of the road. I had to get moveing because there was not much of a  berm on the roadway and people were honking at me. I have no clue what it could of been. it was too big to be a small aircraft stuck in high winds(and it wasn't a windy day). it appeared to be the size of a medium sized plane.;40.0731520851813;-82.4016850931689
