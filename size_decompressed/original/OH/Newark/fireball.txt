We were on 21st in Newark Ohio, 5 of us  My 58 year old wife, 83 father in-law, 42 sister in-law, 21 son, and myself 65 year old ex Navy yeoman aboard the USS Saratoga in the weapons office.  I was also the Captains talker during GQ so I know what airplanes look like in flight at night.   We observed 5 orange fireball type lights leaving the ground and proceeding in an arch going north.  They were about a minute apart following in the same path.  They looked like they maybe reached 1,000 feet.  We observed them until the disappeared.  I observed the same kind of lights this summer going from the south to the north at Seneca Lake Park only there were two of them following each other.  Several persons saw this because I brought to their attention.  I have photos of them.;40.0731520851813;-82.4016850931689
Orange Fireball Shape Floats Across Sky;2013-06-22 23:15:00;5 minutes;Orange Fireball Shape Floats Across Sky While sitting outside at around 11:15 pm my friend and I saw a strange orange light floating high in the sky.  It looked like the light flickered as it moved.   It progressed slowly but at a constant speed and eventually changed angels and move further away from us.  It was much larger than any plane.   We watched it for around 5 minutes and then the light just seemed to turn off.   We continued watching for a other 10 minutes but didn't see anything else.;40.0731520851813;-82.4016850931689
