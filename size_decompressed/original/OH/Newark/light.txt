A strange light flashes in the sky and the lights reflect a dark circular object before it disappears completely;2008-05-24 22:00:00;30 minutes;A strange light flashes in the sky and the lights reflect a dark circular object before it disappears completely At about Ten P.M. Easter Standard Time on May 24th I looked out my window and saw a strange light flashing in the sky. I went outside to get a better view and what I saw was a bright flashing light that was not moving but hovering quietly. It began flashing blue lights and it flashed them in sequences. It would flash a light every second for three seconds and at the third second count it would hold for a longer period of time become very bright and then dim away for a few seconds before starting again. It then seemed to turn and move up and to the left. It stayed in that place and continued blinking and then it would seem to go far away and then appear again. I ruled out any chance of it being a star or an aircraft and after doing this and moving quickly to different positions it stopped completely and went out of sight. My neighbor looked at it and also saw it. A few minutes after it went away it seemed to appear one more time and as it blinked itâ€™s lights you could see the outline of a dark circular shape around it in which the lights were reflecting off of it. It was truly mind-boggling.;40.0731520851813;-82.4016850931689
2 hovering bright lights in the sky, disappearing and reappearing in diff. loc.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of stars??

And i see another small redish ball of light miles away from it which has been up there for over 2 hours. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Red light (orb);2012-04-16 04:00:00;2 minutes;Red light (orb) I was leaving for work when I noticed a bright red object just above the tree line,  I was heading directly toward it for about 30 sec.  In that time I noticed it was moving and had changed directions.  I had a similar sighing last year before the fireworks in Newark also, and was interested enough this time to stop my car and shut off the engine.  I couldn't detect any sound or see any other lights just the red glow.  It was moving in my direction, and I lost sight of it when the street light I was under obstructed its view.  I waited for it to reappear out of the glare of the light, but it never did.  I assumed it had entered cloud cover,  I got into my car pulled forward about 50 yards, to where I had a clear view of the sky, there was no cloud cover at all. In my estimation, it was either very large, or very close to the ground.;40.0731520851813;-82.4016850931689
Single orange light moving very fast W to E;2012-09-28 23:14:00;15 seconds;Single orange light moving very fast W to E My husband and I went onto our back deck to let the dogs out.  We noticed the sound of an airplane, the small kind that only one or two people can sit in.  We noticed a bright orange light moving very quickly over us in a straight line West to East.  At first we thought it was the plane we heard, but as it sped across the sky, we realized it wasn't.   This object had no blinking lights.  It was bright, like the size of Venus on an early spring morning, but orange in hue.  With a full moon tonight, the clouds were illuminated, and this object was flying beneath them.  It was out of sight within 15 seconds, miles and miles away, but we still heard that biplane somewhere, so we know that the object was something else entirely.   The object was never obscured by houses or trees at any point. It either disappeared, or was simply so fast it was hundreds of miles away in mere seconds.  I am a very logical thinker, and I cannot imagine what, in my index of known objects, this was.   Moments after, a commercial plane flew in from another direction. It was blinking and went behind the clouds. The UFO was, without a doubt, not an airplane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous provides no contact information.
