Craft hovers over our house in Newark Ohio across from the OSU Newark campus.;1976-06-01 23:00:00;5 minutes;Craft hovers over our house in Newark Ohio across from the OSU Newark campus. This event took place when I was 10 and my Grandparents have passed so the date is approximate.  There were other reports on the event, but I have not located them yet.  The event took place in Newark Ohio accross the street from the OSU newark campus.  My Grandmother had gone to her room to change for bed.  A very bright light in the sky caught her attention.  Grandma watched the light for a few minutes and suddenly the light came right at the house.  I remember hearing Grandma scream.  My Grandfather, my Mother and I ran to her room.  She was staring out the window and told us to look.  There was a huge craft hovering over our house.  We were stunned.  Eventually the craft slowly started to drift to the back of the house.  We ran out the back door and watched the craft slowly move over our yard over the tree tops.  This thing was as big as many houses, made no noise, had lights around the edge and it was so close we felt you could have thrown a baseball and hit it.  We are no longer doubters.  We didn't see a flash, a blur, a light, we saw the craft up close and personal.  I remember there were other sittings reported the next day but I have not been able to locate them on the internet yet.  I am heading to the Libray soon to see if it was reported in the Advocate the next day.  I believe it was and by many.  Still researching!!!  I want to get the exact date and time...I will correct it when I get the info. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.0731520851813;-82.4016850931689

10 Circular bright white objects over Newark, Ohio.;2012-03-13 01:00:00;4 Min;10 Circular bright white objects over Newark, Ohio. Tuesday March 13, 2012 1:26am I was out taking a walk with my girlfriend around 1:26am.  I remember thinking to myself how small we really are in the universe, and how much we really still don't understand.  And at that moment me and my girlfriend looked up into the sky and we noticed 4 glowing balls of light moving at a descent speed.  I wasn't sure at first what they were.  They came out from behind a cloud in a tranglier movement heading Southwest.  After the four objects flew right over they dispeared into the clouds.  And as those four went behind the clouds six more came out from behind the clouds moving in a straight line. They seemed to be in the shape of a average star. The light omencing from these circular objects were white bright lights.;40.0731520851813;-82.4016850931689
White objects in group flying together.;2012-03-13 01:26:00;3-4 minutes;White objects in group flying together. I was out taking a walk with my boyfriend on east main street,  Beside the local speedway,  It was about 1:26 am and we both looked up at the sky at the same time.  It was very cloudy,  The clouds were very thick and moving kinda fast.  All of a sudden we seen an object in the sky moving out of the clouds,  We knew it was not a star because the stars were not moving.  The object we seen had 4 other objects following it. about 10 secods after that 5 other objects were following the other objects as if they were going somewhere, or maybe getting away from something.  These objects were a little bit bigger than stars.  But appeared as stars. It was very strange,  They were moving a moderate speed.  These objects were moving south west.  Towards Columbus, Ohio.  It was strange, Like nothing I have ever seen before.;40.0731520851813;-82.4016850931689
Reddish orange flaming ball.;2012-03-16 21:00:00;5 mins;Reddish orange flaming ball. The object in question was a redish orange ball of fire that had no tail.  the fire looked as though the power source was contained within a sphere.  it moved from the south to north stopping occasionaly and at one point it turned in a circle and then started north.  it then went to a spot then stopped and stayed there till it gradually got smaller and smaller till it disapeared.

Bright Red Circular Light;2015-04-08 20:45:00;15 minutes;Bright Red Circular Light At 8:45 pm, my wife and I saw a bright red circular object in the WSW horizon.  At first we thought it was a plane.  It appeared to be moving in our direction, but it stopped and reversed its direction and arrived back to its original spot.   The object then made all sorts of circular moments and weird angled movements.  Next, it would rise up and then down again hiding in the tree line.  It did this movement a couple of times before disappearing.   I would guess it was maybe a couple miles from our location. Our location is between state route 79 north and reform road.  This is the third time we have seen strange things in our night skies that we could not explain.   If it wasn't for the fact we go outside to smoke cigarettes we would not have witnessed any of the events.;40.0731520851813;-82.4016850931689
