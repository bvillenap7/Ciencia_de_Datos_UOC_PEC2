Sphere orange light anomaly in the sky;2012-09-22 21:56:00;<5 minutes;Sphere orange light anomaly in the sky Last night, I was delivering pizza at the local shop I work at.  It was like any other night.  I had just picked up an order from the store and was on my to drop it off.  The location where I was going was maybe 2.5 miles from where I was at.  It was aprox. 9:50 pm and I had turned off a main road (busy with traffic on to a side street.  Out of the corner of my left eye I saw an orange sphere shaped object in the sky.  It had interested me because of the shear size of the sphere.  (if you were to hold a penny as far out with your left hand it appeared to he that size ).  As I'm driving I am still looking at this object when I notice another of the same objects appeared. Now 2 sphere shaped glowing orange Ufos were in my sight by hey began a theater totter motion as one went up the other went down.  At this time I pulled to a stop sight from the side street I was on which was still only about 250 ft from the main road.  The spheres dimmed in color as I pulled ou! t my iPhone to capture about 40 seconds of video. After recording this I had called a friend to explain what was still before my eyes and I began to drive towards the objects.  The opposite direction of my delivery.  As I came to another stop light the objects dissipated into the sky.;40.0731520851813;-82.4016850931689
