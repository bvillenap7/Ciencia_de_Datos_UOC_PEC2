It was around 10:20 pm, and I observed them for approximately 5 minutes, until they disappeared.  They appeared “medium sized.”  I do not have an estimate of height, but I believe the sky was overcast, and they would have been below the level of the clouds. I wondered if they might be spotlights, but at no time did I see any “leader” lights extending between and orbs and the ground.  I had an impression of sentience from them.  To me, the most interesting thing about these orbs has always been their way of moving around, which was instantaneously. My sighting began by seeing one of the lights in the sky.  As I watched it, a second identical orb appeared next to it.  After a while, one of the orbs disappeared from where it was and instantly appeared in another part of the sky.  Then the second orb moved in the same manner to appear next to the first.  This process repeated to another part of the overhead sky.  After a while, first one of the lights disappeared, and then the second.  I consider this my one and only “UFO experience.”;41.1828999999999;-80.7591000000002
