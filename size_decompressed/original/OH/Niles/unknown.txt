Pulsating light over the Chipotle Plaza started white and pulsated into a reddish yellow color lasting 3-4 secs and 2 secs in between.;2019-12-10 17:32:00;20;Pulsating light over the Chipotle Plaza started white and pulsated into a reddish yellow color lasting 3-4 secs and 2 secs in between. Pulsating light over the Chipotle Plaza started white and pulsated into a reddish yellow color. There were 3 total pulsations with 2 seconds in between each, and looked like it was coming from  behind chipotle but overhead. Each flash lasted about 3-4 seconds, too long for a lightening flash. We checked the forecast and there was no radar evidence of storms. It was 27 degrees so lightening is unlikely. The observers were 3 females and 2 males all walking into the plaza at the same time. 2 were still in a car facing the plaza. The other group commented on the light and that’s how my group noticed it wasn’t just us who seen it.;41.1828999999999;-80.7591000000002
