The sky was clear blue and I first saw the UFO’s in the Southeast sky traveling Northwest at an estimated speed similar to airliners.  There was a cluster of 4 UFO’s with 2 more UFO’s trailing.  They were not in a symmetrical pattern, but they did stay in formation.   At first glance I thought it was a group of balloons that somebody released, because even though the UFO’s were traveling in a straight path, they had the appearance of floating through the sky like balloons or bubbles.  I say they were bubble-like because when I was looking at them, they were traveling in a straight-line trajectory, but they seemed to each individually be floating like bubbles with a small wobble.  The UFO’s were round and white and did appear to have a reflective surface but there were no visible lights or changing of colors.  I know! they were not balloons because they did not separate from each other and they moved too fast.  I recorded the UFO’s with my G9 Samsung phone and was able to capture about 30 seconds of quality footage.  The UFO’s are not blatantly obvious when watching the video, but if you take the time to pause the video and zoom, you can see them all no problem.  There were no noises coming from the objects, and no trailing aircraft.  I called two small local airports to see if they had any radar pings that matched my story, but the Mentor on the Lake airport said they didn’t have that type of equipment and the airport in Highland Heights said that it was handled through the large radars at the major area airports and that I’d have to contact them.;41.7059000000004;-81.1997000000001
