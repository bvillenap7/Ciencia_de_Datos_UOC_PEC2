I saw 2 undefinable fireball objects just before sunset on 8/7/2013;2013-08-07 19:45:00;5 minutes;I saw 2 undefinable fireball objects just before sunset on 8/7/2013 I was standing on my back patio when I noticed a fireball type object flying east which at first I wrote off to being a plane reflecting the sunset but then a plane flew west right past the fireball which was clearly identified to have wings and didn't reflect sun the way this looked.  Then the second fireball came from west to east following the first, slightly slowed, and then proceeded.  The sky was clear w a few transparent clouds that the fireballs disapeared through and were out of site.;41.7059000000004;-81.1997000000001
