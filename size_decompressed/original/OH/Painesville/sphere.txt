Anyways one second elapses of me staring at the object and it was almost as if the object knew I saw it and it bolted off it bolted off opposite of Lake Erie it also left a trail because of how fast it traveled, the light from the aircraft was floating in the air I was at awe of how beautiful it looked then in an instant it was gone like it moved south west and had different things to do. This was my first official UFO sighting all my other sightings were coincidences and easily explainable phenmenon but it was a feeling as if I knew I saw something spectacular. The color of the craft was a reflective white looking object almost looked like a star but it wasent because it wasent a self sustaining light you could tell because when it flew away the light that it was reflecting dissipated as-well indicating it couldâ€™ve been using the lights from the city to charge up its vehicle real quick and then flew away when it had charge.;41.7059000000004;-81.1997000000001
