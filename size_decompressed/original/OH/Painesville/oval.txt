At first i thought it was the one we just saw, as me and my boyfriend wathced the one go past his family saw another one following it and then another one. we watched it for a good 10 to 20 minutes until we thought it was kind of weird and freaky and went back into the house. I don't know when they went away but I know there were at least 3/4 of them that me and my boyfiend saw.;41.7059000000004;-81.1997000000001
