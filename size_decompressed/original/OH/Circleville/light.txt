Bright orange lights go on, and off in Circlville, OH.;2003-10-01 23:00:00;5-10 min.;Bright orange lights go on, and off in Circlville, OH. I am a truck driver who does OTR runs. I had emptied in Lancaster, Oh, and was heading to my next pick-up in Haverhill, OH. My first sighting was as I was entering the outskirts of Circleville, OH. I noticed three fire colored (bright orange)lights, in a straight line, that went out back to front. My first thought was it was some tower or plane going through cloud cover. As I watched the area the lights came back on in a different place, stayed on for 5 to 6 seconds, and then went back out. I couldn't tell how many there were after the first three. I estimate 3-6. They continued this routine, come on, go out, change places, come back on, for approximately 7 to 8 minutes. I don't know if they stopped the routine, I watched until I couldn't see them anymore. Another thing, I don't know if this has anything to do with the lights, but there were also three small points of light that I thought were airplanes at a distance, but they made a triangle around the orange lights. From debth perception, I know the two aren't physically connected though. A question that might need to be answered is, is there a military base, or testing/practice area close to Circleville?

Fire colored orange lights spotted in Circleville, OH.;2004-11-13 22:30:00;1-2 min.;Fire colored orange lights spotted in Circleville, OH. I'm a OTR truck driver from Kentucky. On 11/13/04 at around 10pm to 10:30pm, I was passing through Circleville, OH on my way to Ohio Furnace, OH. As I neared Circleville I noticed three bright, fire colored orange lights lined up in a row. They were front to back from my point of vission. Very quickly however, the lights went out one at a time from back to front. The best way I could describe this is to have you imagine three radio tower lights on a mountain, and a cloud comming from behind at a brisk pace and obscuring them. Anyway, the lights proceded to come on, and go out repeatedly, never showing in the same location twice, and never together again either. This made it very difficult to count them. I can say for sure there were three, but there could have easily been more. I didn't stop, but watched this weird occurance until I could no longer see the lights.  My question is did anyone else witness this, and is there any military installations around this area?;39.5985000000001;-82.9258999999996
White, star-like light flew across the sky and then made a sudden sharp upward turn and completely disappeared.;2019-10-09 07:02:00;5 seconds;White, star-like light flew across the sky and then made a sudden sharp upward turn and completely disappeared. White, star-like light that we assumed at first to be maybe an aircraft going really fast, but then it made a sudden sharp upward turn and then completely disappeared without a trace.  No sound.  I have never witnessed anything like that in my entire life.;39.5985000000001;-82.9258999999996
