5-6 strange Phoenix lights in a row west of Chillicothe.;2008-03-01 18:30:00;10-15mins;5-6 strange Phoenix lights in a row west of Chillicothe. I was heading south on St. Rte 104, about a half mile south of  762. I noticed 5-6 lights in a line west of Chillicothe. I remember looking for a plane thinking that they were flares, but saw none. They exactly like the Phoenix lights and as I got closer to Circleville they started to disappear. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

(We)...could see what looked like a dim star appear heading North real slow and disappear.  ((anonymous report));2017-06-16 23:30:00;10 seconds;My wife and I are camping in Circleville, Ohio.  Our tent has a full screen top so you can view the night sky.  As we are looking at the sky you could see what looked like a dim star appear heading North real slow and disappear.  Lasted 10 to 15 seconds.   Second unexplained sighting for me this year.  I love watching for them. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.
