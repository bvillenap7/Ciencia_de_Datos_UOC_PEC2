It was heading northeast at about 3000 feet and approximately 300-350 miles mph.  It was first seen below the full moon for about 3 or 4 seconds.  The whole sighting lasted about 20 seconds.  These figures are of course estimated.  No sound could be heard above the outside plant noise (which was moderate).  The bottom of the craft was seen from the 5th floor at the plant.  It looked grayish in color.  The craft appeared to be a little longer than the fuselage of a Boeing 707.  Two large white blinking lights were on the end.  Both lights blinked at the same time.  Another small red light appeared in the middle.  Two small white lights were in front bottom of the braft.  These lights also blinked.  I was outside and looking toward the moon, which was high up in the Eastern sky.  It was cloudless at the time in that section of the sky.  The outline of the craft could clearly be seen because of the moonlight.  The craft was last seen just east of the local GE plant and still flying horizontal.  I later called Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base's control tower.  No other calls were received about this sighting.  My personal feeling is that this object was perhaps one of our secret projects or an alien craft.;39.5985000000001;-82.9258999999996
Triangular Lights, Ohio, 2005.;2005-08-01 02:00:00;30 seconds;Triangular Lights, Ohio, 2005 A friend and I were catfishing on the Scioto River during an August night/early morning.  I had just graduaded from High School and he was about to go into the Army.  We sat around on the riverbank and caught channel and flathead catfish.  We cooked some hot dogs and drank grape soda. Onto the UFO business:  At approximately 0200 hours a triangular formation of lights appeared above us.  It seemed relatively far away because I could not make out anything other than the lights, but was quite large.  The lights vanished after we looked at it for a little while.  It was a major &quotwhat the hell was that?&quot moment.  No noise.  Nothing.  We sort of joked how we better not say anything about it to our buddies or else we would surely be laughed at. Today:  I saw a video on a local San Francisco News (CBS) website that showed these same lights.  It was an amatuer video, but it looked exactly like the lights I saw!   Here it is:  http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2012/12/10/unexplained-light-formation-spotted-above-sf-mission/   Anyways, I just had to say something after seeing this video.  What I saw was for sure abnormal, whatever it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));39.5985000000001;-82.9258999999996

I looked closely and realized it wasn't.  I knew it wasn't because it was lagging across the sky and planes go smooth, and it shoot off real fast and it was gone.;39.5985000000001;-82.9258999999996

Mistaken for a helicopter at first and was just a few hundred feet above the equipment in the field.  We saw one bright light, then a second one appeared next to it. Then one disappeared, and another appeared.  Then the first one and then all three at once. All of this happened quite slowly.  I slowed down to try and get a video, as I did this all 3 lights showed and dissolved inside each other.  This was a sighting of a lifetime and I am so glad my fianc√© and I got to share the experience.  I truly want to see this again.;39.5985000000001;-82.9258999999996
