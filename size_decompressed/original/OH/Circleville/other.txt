I have been seeing an unusual amount of falling stars lately but this time I was look for a certain constelation and saw 2 stars sitting together.  One of the stars stayed in place and eventually disappeared, but at the same time there was another star sitting right next to it and it went to the north in a steady stream across the sky.  It could NOT have been a falling star, (falling stars head south, this one went parallel.  It went across the sky for about 2 min. tops in a straight direction before it disappeared in the distant sky.  I know I could not have been the only one to see it.  I called the hotline you have twice, (twice because I didn't think I gave enough info the first time).  The star that was next to the one that I am reporting seemed to stay in place before decending backwards into the black sky.  This is not the first time I have exper! ienced something like that, I usually kept it to myself out of fear of being called nuts, but this time I know for sure what I saw and I refuse to keep quiet about it, someone else HAD to have seen it as well, if not, someone is not paying enough attention!;39.5985000000001;-82.9258999999996
2 space worms on a pre-dawn outing over central Ohio.;2015-09-18 05:30:00;2-3 minutes;2 space worms on a pre-dawn outing over central Ohio. I am not really sure of the date of this occurrence, but I know it was in the fall of last year.  I am very sure of the time though as it occurred when I got home from work, which is usually just before 5:30 am.  I have a habit of doing some star gazing when I get home and on this night it was particularly clear. I was facing more of less due east and was looking almost straight up, maybe 80 degrees of incline, when I observed two white fuzzy, extremely faint worm looking things plodding along next to each other in a northerly direction.  It appeared one of the worms was slinking along in a steady fashion while the other was doing more of a zigzag pattern and flying around the other.  It would remind you of a mother dolphin cruising with a baby dolphin swimming around her. Not really sure of what I was seeing, and thinking I my eyes were playing tricks on me, I looked to a different part of the sky for a couple seconds.  I thought I'd see the worms there because I was pretty sure it was one of those instances where you see something moving, but it's just a floater(as my optometrist calls them) that is inside your eyeball.  Not seeing anything in the patch of sky I was looking at I looked back to where I had seen the worms and sure enough I saw them still going in their northerly direction. I did one more check by looking to another part of the sky and then back at the worms and had the same result.  Still very perplexed I watched the objects continue northbound until I could no longer see them.  In all I probably observed the objects for 2-3 minutes and they covered about a 35 degree traverse of the sky.  As I said before they were extremely faint and appeared to be at a very, very high altitude.  As for a size, the best way I can think of to put a scale to it would be to use the diameters of the stars.  They appeared to both be about 5 star diameters long and 1 wide.  I've seen plenty of satellites in the night sky and I can definitely say the worms were going much slower. I've only ever told my brother about this.  Being that I'm a police officer it's not exactly something I'm going to share with my coworkers and friends.  The closest thing I've seen resembling these objects are in some of the space serpents or space worms videos online.  However, what I saw was not merely drifting but appeared to be propelled(albeit very slowly) and guided in some way, but they did not appear to be a craft or ship of any sort.  Even though I still do some star gazing when I get home I have yet to see my serpent friends again.  If I do I will report it in a more timely fashion.
