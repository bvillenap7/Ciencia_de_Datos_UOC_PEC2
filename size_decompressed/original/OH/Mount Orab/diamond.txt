Orange UFO lights seen in the night sky.;2016-09-13 22:30:00;20 minutes;Orange UFO lights seen in the night sky. At 10:30 pm my family were on our back porch and from the northeast about 10 miles or so in the sky, a big red circle appeared in the sky.  The dogs in the area started barking and from the orange light, five small lights appeared from it.  Then the big orange light disappeared.  The smaller diamond shaped lights flew around the area or more then 15 minutes.  Also, when the big orange light appeared, it made a loud humming sound, that actually vibrated the ground near us.  I did take footage of these light on my phone.;39.0454;-83.948
