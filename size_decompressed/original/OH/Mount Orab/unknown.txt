Stationary lights that just appear, and dissappear.  No sound.;2017-10-17 20:30:00;30-60 minutes;Stationary lights that just appear, and dissappear.  No sound. Saw the lights first, while driving into town, then we got home, we drove to the back of our property and turned out the car lights and only had to wait a few minutes. It starts with what looks like strobe lights in fog.  Multiple little strobes, then we see the lights appear, and then a one light comes out of another, then another.  They appeared above and below as well.   Multiple lights in multiple positions, now way to know if it was one, or many.;39.0454;-83.948
