Exotic Mystery Lights In Our Mount Orab Sky on 9/13/2007;2007-09-13 21:30:00;30-45min;Exotic Mystery Lights In Our Mount Orab Sky on 9/13/2007 On september 13,2007 me and two of my buddies decited to go fishing at a local lake in our area we arrived at aprox. 8:30 pm we got all or gear set up and had just casted our pole's out and was waiting for our first bite we were joking and laughing talking about women and work and so on it was a really nice night clear sky forever, when one of my friends said look at that light it just came out of nowhere i have seen lights like this before, i see them all the time' it looked like car lights in the sky which made me instantly think what i was looking at was just a plane but that was just the beginning there were 3 more come out of nowhere and extreamely close to each other i started thinking there is no way the F.A.A or local airports are gonna let these planes get this close to each other it lasted a matter of moments they were bright white lights two on each of the four objects and as fast as they came the lights started going out but you could still see the objects in the night sky but just by one small bright light looked like a small star  and they were moving back and forth very slowly and they remained in what looked to be maybe a quarter mile radius in the sky never left this lasted 30min during that time the larger lights would come back on and go back off which at times there were several objects instead of 4 so for the next 15-20 mins we watched the lights do what ever they were doing i have seen alot of unexplainable things in the sky but what we saw next was just wrong there was a larger object appear to the right side of the other large objects already there and something came out of the largest U.F.O there were 7 really bright colorful lights that came out and they created what looked like a half moon formation these lights were bright purple and orange they looked like flare's being shot from a military fighter jet looked like fireworks i started getting worried from not knowing of what i was seeing and i told my friends i wanted to go so we packed up and left i tried t! o take p icture's with my cell phone but i guess my phone isnt that good with picture's at night all these objects were i would say no more than a mile maybe 1 1/2 away from us and there was no sound at all i have never seen anything like this so now im excited to get this on film somehow if i get the chance again...;39.0454;-83.948
