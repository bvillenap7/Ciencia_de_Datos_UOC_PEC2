Pulled over to get a good idea of how fast they were moving and to see if we could see any signs of it being a plane.  They were large, did not blink, and disappeared into the clouds directly above us. I have video of one of the objects.;40.7960999999997;-81.3797999999996
Fireball over the Strip.;2013-10-11 23:00:00;10 seconds;Fireball over the Strip Driving (north) past the strip on route 77, we witnessed a fireball-like shape rocket toward the ground.  As it reached the tops of the buildings, it completely disappeared into thin air - almost as if it burnt out.   The fireball was incredibly bright and really close - you could tell it was not a shooting star or a firework.;40.7960999999997;-81.3797999999996

They traveled for around 5 minutes and were approximately 1/2 mile apart from each other.  They both disappeared (vanished) one after the other.  I live pretty close to a major airport, and this was no airplane or Chinese lantern. And this is not the first time I've seen these out here.  Last summer, July 14th, to be exact, I saw the same thing, but there was only one of them.;40.7960999999997;-81.3797999999996
