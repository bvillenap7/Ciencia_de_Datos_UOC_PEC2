We saw a UFO;2011-01-02 18:00:00;5 mim;We saw a UFO We were traveling on 77 and looking toward Akron Canton Airport.  We saw what we thought was a plane traveling at a very fast speed and making usual turns.  My husband notice it also and he was saying that is going way to fast to be a plane.  We watch it come right across in front of us and than at a second notice disappear right in front of our eyes.  There is no way that a plane could turn that fast or travel at that speed.  I knew we just saw a UFO ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.7960999999997;-81.3797999999996
