4 balls of moving orange lights.;2017-07-15 22:56:00;5 minutes;4 balls of moving orange lights As I was driving to work, I saw 4 balls of light that were a dull burnt orange in color.  When I first noticed them, they were in the shape similar to a backwards s.   I went to grab my phone to try and take a picture/video of what I was seeing, when I looked back up at the sky the balls of light had begun to move into more of a square or diamond formation.   When I arrived at work minutes later I could no longer see them in the sky.;40.7960999999997;-81.3797999999996
