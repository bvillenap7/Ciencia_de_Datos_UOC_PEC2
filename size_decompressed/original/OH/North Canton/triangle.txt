Shimmering Orange triangular light hovering in the sky above a house in North Canton Ohio;2013-10-26 22:00:00;10;Shimmering Orange triangular light hovering in the sky above a house in North Canton Ohio Sighted what we feel was a UFO.  No other explanation fits. We were sitting on our porch smoking last night around 10:00PM.  Both my husband and I love to look at stars and the moon at night.   I saw something out of the corner of my eye and to the left of us over a house was this bright shimmering orange light.  I thought that it was a start at first but it was so bright and big.  I squinted to see it clearer and noticed it was in a triangular shape.    We watched it as it seemed to hover, bouncing slightly up and down for a while.  I looked away for a little bit talking to my husband and he kept watching it.  He told me it then moved slowly off to the left behind a house and just seemed to disappear.;40.7960999999997;-81.3797999999996
