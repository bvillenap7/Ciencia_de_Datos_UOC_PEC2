8 glowing spheres floating in a line formation.;2014-09-27 22:55:00;5 minutes;8 glowing sphears floating in a line formation. First seen 5 globes of orangish lights, ballon like floating..  A couple got very close to one another.  They seemed to be floating across the sky in a single file pathway.  Moving west to east.  A few mins after the first 5 globes I seen 3 more appeared and floated in the same flight path as the others.  Objects from my view were approx. an inch circumference.  They were different distances apart from one another.  And seemed to travel until I could no longer see them.  They seemed to almost flicker with light.  No sound at all was heard.;40.7960999999997;-81.3797999999996
Several bright glowing objects in North Canton, Ohio, near the Akron Canton Airport.;2015-02-06 16:00:00;5 minutes;Several bright glowing objects in North Canton, Ohio, near the Akron Canton Airport. At just after 4 PM on February 6th, 2015, I witnessed no less than 3, and possibly 4, bright craft high in the skies over North Canton in Northeast Ohio, very close to the Akron/Canton airport. These were very high in the sky and seemed to be close to freshly sprayed Chemtrails/Contrails.  I believe that they were emitting some sort of light because every so often, they would turn dark for a few seconds and then turn very bright again. I am pretty certain that these were not conventional aircraft because they were gracefully and quickly turning, pausing and looping in and around each other.  This doesnâ€™t seem like what a typical aircraft would or should do, let alone near an busy airport.;40.7960999999997;-81.3797999999996
While star gazing last night with my Son, we saw a white round light (constant, no AV lights or colors), that we saw moving East to Wes;2018-09-23 22:00:00;~15-20 seconds;While star gazing last night with my Son, we saw a white round light (constant, no AV lights or colors), that we saw moving East to West in short stutter step type distances that seemed to start, move then stop, then repeat.  It only progressed a relatively short distance before fading out of sight. My vision is 20/10. When this thing faded away it was clearly moving away from the Earth.  I've seen three in my time (one similar and one triangular), and this was the first I've seen pull straight up away from the Earth.;40.7960999999997;-81.3797999999996
