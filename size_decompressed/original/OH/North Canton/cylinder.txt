Unusual object with very dim, steady lights darts across sky;2001-03-22 20:50:00;5-6 seconds;Unusual object with very dim, steady lights darts across sky Was casually observing starlit night sky outside while at work. Observed 3 or 4 airpanes in night sky as is usual at any given time as a regional airport exists 5 minutes from my observation point and a major airport exits an hour to the North.  I happened to glance toward the East when right in my eye sight I observed two faintly visible, white, dim, non-blinking lights moving to the East NorthEast at what I thought was an impossible rate of speed for even a military jet, which is rarely seen around here. My assumption at that time was it was one fairly long object with one dim, non-blinking light forward and one dim, non-blinking light at the rear at an undeterminable altitude.  No wing lights seemed visible although between front and rear lights a very slight dim, white illumination seemed barely noticable along the edges of its body. The observed object was at about 60 degrees from my vantage point and covered about two thirds of the sky within approximately 5 seconds or so. Suddenly the object slowed down so very rapidly it barely seemed possible.  It seemed to just coast slowly for a second and it then just vanished.  Although sounds from the nearby airplanes could be heard, when the object I saw darted across the sky I thought I could hear a faint, steady sound like a hum of some sort but unlike that of an airplane or jet engine.;40.7960999999997;-81.3797999999996
