I ran inside to tell my teenage girls and my partner and they all came outside to watch.  As we were watching, another one came up and followed the other one.  We watched for about 7 minutes as they disappeared in the horizon.  It is something I have never seen before.;39.0454;-82.6418000000001
Early morning fireball going east to west.;2014-01-04 07:35:00;3-5 seconds;Early morning fireball going east to west. My son and I witnessed a fireball in the sky going from east to west.  It was orange in color and we could see smaller pieces breaking off of it.  It didn't seem to leave a trail behind it. We were facing south and it was not near the sunrise. It was seen at dawn but it was almost daylight.  We were deer hunting and could see to the end of the 20 acre field it flew over with no problem. The glowing stopped before it went behind the trees so I assume it burn up or broke through the atmosphere.  It did not seem to fizzle out it just stopped burning and was still about the same size as when it started. The sighting lasted about 3-5 seconds.;39.0454;-82.6418000000001
