Light moving in couterclockwise motion in sky, didn't appear to be coming from above or below.;2017-10-06 19:30:00;1 1/2 hours;Light moving in couterclockwise motion in sky, didn't appear to be coming from above or below. On the evenings of 10-6 and 10-7-2017, we watched a light in sky, moving in counterclockwise motion, pattern never changed, always moving in circular motion, very fast, moving east.  Almost looked like a spotlight moving in circular motion, but didn't appear to be coming from above or below.  Neighbors witnessed same thing.   Lasted from 7pm till around 9:30 pm both evenings.  We live on a farm and this was right over one of our pastures which has no homes, buildings or light near it.  We attempted to video it, but it would not show up on video.;39.0454;-82.6418000000001
~1.75 hours after sunset approx. 20 lights flew in straight line SW to NE fading out at certain point.   ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-05 20:10:00;15 minutes;Around 1.75 hours after sunset approx. 20 equidistant lights flew in straight line southwest to northeast fading out at certain point At about 8:10 PM Eastern we saw a series of 15 to 25 moving lights in the sky in a line moving from south west to north east (roughly seemingly in the direction of Portsmouth, Ohio towards Chillicothe / Cleveland, Ohio. These were solid lights that were fading into view and then faded out of view at a certain point in the sky (no real clouds in the area) so it appeared as though they were flying from a lower to higher plane / angle as if going into the stratosphere or space. Due to the number of the objects, the shock of the experience and way they were fading out we were unable to count the exact number and there could have been many more. 6 people saw this event.  The objects were initially mistaken as stars due to the seeming height and faintness of their lighting. It is possible that at this time the western setting sun could have been reflecting from their bodies and causing this lighting of the many objects.  There were 3-5 other flying planes or jets with flashing lights that appeared to be monitoring the situation / flying around the area.  There was a sonic boom approximately 30-60 minutes before we saw this.  There has been a sonic boom every evening / night this week (sometimes later than this), which is peculiar for this area. The Wright Patterson Air Force Base resides approximately 70 miles northwest of this region, however these objects did not appear to be coming from or going to this location. These have been particularly powerful booms that nearly are able to knock things off the walls.;39.0454;-82.6418000000001
