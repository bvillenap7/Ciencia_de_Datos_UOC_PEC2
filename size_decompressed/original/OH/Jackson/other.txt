I saw 2 ball's if light.  One red and one blue.  ((anonymous report));1987-07-15 01:00:00;1 minute;I was in the woods.  My friend's parents owned 80 acres in the hills of Jackson, Ohio.  Down the street from the Bob Evan's farm.  I saw 2 ball's if light.  One red and one blue.  Not much bigger than a basketball, darting back in forth through the trees.  Maybe 20 feet from me.  The sound was like a wushing sound kinda like a helicopter but no wind.  This was in the wood's on the side of a valley.

Horse shoe shaped UFO, Jackson, Ohio.;2009-04-02 21:00:00;1 minute;Horse shoe shaped UFO, Jackson, Ohio. Cycling along McCarty Lane at some time around nine o'clock I became aware of an unusually bright light, moving at a moderate speed with little altitude.  At first I thought it could have been a small military training jet, but the light was accompanied with no sound.  I continued to cycle until I reached the end of the lane. At this point I observed what looked like an illuminated horse shoe shaped object travel over some wooded land near the highway. I didn't get a close look at it, but I would say it was around 70 feet in length, 50 feet wide and a hight of 15 feet.  As I have said, it was moving at reasonable speed, possibly 300-400 mph and was flying quite low, no more than 400 feet.  Finally, the horseshoe looked as though there was a ring of light surrounding it, like a halo. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
