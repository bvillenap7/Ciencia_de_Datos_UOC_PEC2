Two UFO's witnessed in Jackson, OH;2011-09-17 19:45:00;20-30 minutes;Two UFO's witnessed in Jackson, OH Driving W on OH-32, my husband, son and I noticed a bright white light straight ahead of us.  At first i thought it was a tower light, but as we got closer to it i noticed the light was much larger and higher than a tower.  We pulled off the road to watch it and it stayed in the same spot for about 3 minutes.  It then began to hover in a circular path.  It hovered this path 2 times and then went off path and hovered in one position.  A second object came out of nowhere and fast towards the first object.  The second object resembles a long stretched out diamond with the points being very thin.  It has several pulsating white lights on it and at first appeared as a straight line of lights. It was moving mush faster then the first object.   As it got closer to the first object it continued to flash its lights faster.  The first object began to flash several red,green and white lights and begin to hover away.  The second object took off fast in the direction it came and wa! s out of sight quickly.  We left as the first object hovered away.  There was no sound from either object and at one point the first object was almost directly above our heads.  We noticed that both object seemed to be flying rather low.;39.0454;-82.6418000000001
