Star-like object that pulsed bright red, green and white colors and hovered about one location but made quick short movements.;1998-02-27 22:00:00;4 hours;Star-like object that pulsed bright red, green and white colors and hovered about one location but made quick short movements. Saw an object, don't know what it was, on three different occasions.   On or about 2/27/98 it appeared to be the closest.  It looked like a star, but it twinkled more than a star and was brighter than the stars that were out.  The strange thing is that the object appeared to hover in a general location but would make erratic movements in different directions from the central location, about 30 degrees above the horizon looking East. The object never makes a noise and is higher in the sky than any airplanes that pass under it.  The movements are sometimes quick and sometimes slow, but there is definite movement.   The eeriest thing is that when looking through binoculars, you could see bright red, green and white lights that appear to be whirling around the object.  No star does that.   I had 5 witnesses the night that it was closest, and there have been at least two other people see it on 2 other occasions, in the approximate same location.  I am near an observatory, and talking to the operators, the closest thing they can figure is possibly seeing Artuerus.  i plan on filming it the next time I see it on a clear night.   On one occasion, what looked like a shooting star shot out from the object.;40.6211;-82.5185
