(he has severe sight problems.) It looked a lot like one of those firecrackers on july4th that are big and round. it was probably 2 to 3 miles ahead of me, crossing from my right to my left, heading north. the sparks falling downward were white.there was no noise. it just disappeared, as if it shut the light out.;41.0011;-82.6634
