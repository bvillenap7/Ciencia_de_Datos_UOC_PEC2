RT. 61 between Shelby and Plymouth I spotted a huge triangle shaped object. While driving North on 61 between Shelby and Plymouth myself and two children spotted a triangle shaped craft.  It had a bright amber colored light on the front corner.  It headed North east.  When we got to Plymouth we spotted it again coming over the town.  only then it had more colored lights.  It was huge.  I tried to get a police officer to get out of his car and see the craft that I was able to spot coming toward us between 2 buildings, of course he thought I was joking and he wouldn't.  Then all of the sudden it disappeared.  Like it just turned the lights off with a switch.  It made no noise.  This thing was huge.  I wish I could remember more fully the details.  It was over 30 years ago.;41.0011;-82.6634
