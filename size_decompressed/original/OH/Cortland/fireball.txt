I was sitting on the couch in the living room when I saw this bright red fireball streaking down the sky toward the ground.  I ran out onto my deck figuring something had exploded and was going to crash.   No crash and no lights from an explosion.  There were a lot of cars on the main road (Route 5) so I know I am not the only one who saw this.  There is nothing on the news here or in the paper.;41.3222;-80.7443000000001
