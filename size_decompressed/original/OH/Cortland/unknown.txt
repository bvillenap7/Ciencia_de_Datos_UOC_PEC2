At first glance, it just looked like a little cluster of stars, but they were a little dimmer than all the rest.  I should also mention that the sky was VERY clear tonight and the moon wasn’t in a spot where the sunlight reflection would drown out all the stars so it was really easy to see the sky. The little cluster of dimly lit stars looked normal until I looked at it through peripheral vision, and then it looked like, a sort of cloudy mass with tiny pinprick bright spots in it.  The longer I looked at it, the more I could see that the little lights were moving around in a really weird, erratic manner.  There would be three, they’d make a sort of triangle shape, but then there would be four, and it would look like they formed a straight line, then they’d all kind of disperse and not be any kind of shape really but they’d be moving around a little bit and it kind of made me think of the way gnats swarm around in groups.  And the cloudy area behind it, along with the lights themselves, all seemed to be moving as a whole in one direction (possibly north) in a slow, creeping sort of way.  My partner and I believe this is the first time either of us have witnessed a UFO.;41.3222;-80.7443000000001
