Driving South on St. Rt. 42 approaching Twp. Rd. 810, I observed a very large flash of yellow lights in a diamond shape sequence, immediately following this flash was a blast of what appeared to be fire from the rear.  I saw no shape, just these flashes, and the flame.  The night was rather clear, with no clouds.  The object appeared to be flying in a downward motion.  I recall thinking that if it continued to fly in this manner, it appeared as if it would land in Hidden Acres Campgrounds.  I observed this phenomenon 5 times before turning onto Twp. Rd. 810, and immediately onto the private drive.  I was still watching this through the trees, and saw it flash and fire 3 more times.  I parked my car, and got out to see if I could see it better.  When I did so, it was gone. If comparing these yellow lights, if a star would appear as a . (period), then these lights appeared to be o (a lower case o).  There appeared to be 4 seperate lights, but all flashed together. The fire from the end of it was even larger. I would compare the width of it from a small o to a capital O. And the length of it was 4 times more. The lights were yellow, reminding me of caution lights, the flame, was first in line was blue, and then orange, and then red, but all together. Very similar to what a jet engine looks like when it takes off and the flame shoots out the back of the engine.
