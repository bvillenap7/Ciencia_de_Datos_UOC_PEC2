Observation of unusual lights.;2007-05-12 23:50:00;1.5 Minutes;Observation of unusual lights. 	On the evening of May 12, 2007 at approximately 23:50 hours, my wife and I were sitting on the front stoop of our house smoking a cigarette. Our house faces a westerly direction and is in a residential area of a small town.  	I frequently look into the night sky to watch the jets as they travel overhead. This night was a particularly clear, cloudless night with many stars visible. As I looked upward and towards the western horizon, I noted in my peripheral vision, two (2) lights moving from the south towards the north. As they passed behind a treetop, I thought to myself that this was a particularly long plane with a different type of lighting.  	When the objects passed into clear vision, past the treetop, I noticed that the coloration of the light was a bluish or greenish, fluorescence, unlike the color of a star or airplane light. The objects had a very smooth movement and a much quicker speed than that of an airplane. There was no audible sound associated with the appearance or movement of the lights. They appeared to be irregular in shape and were comparable in size to that of a large star, i.e. with their distance away being unknown their size rivaled that of a large star.  	As I watched the lights move in a straight line in a northerly direction past the treetop, the one in front suddenly moved to a position overtop of the other, i.e. they assumed a vertical position to one another. The one in front flew backwards over the one in the rear.  	After this action took place both objects then began a wobbly pattern of movement. The wobbling was in an upward/downward pattern and was in unison. These lights then abruptly stopped the wobbling and proceeded onward in their northerly direction. They passed beyond my vision behind the canopy of a larger tree which blocked their visibility and I watched for several minutes to see if they emerged from this position, however, they never reappeared.  	After this display was over, my wife said to me, “did you see those lights?”.  	I do note that several minutes after this appearance and disappearance, I was still looking upwards about the sky and I observed what appeared to be a “shooting star” which moved in an east to west direction across the sky and disappeared while halfway to the horizon. It’s color and shape were normal for a shooting star, however, it seemed like it was larger than the average. Another thing which seemed unusual was that we do not normally see shooting stars in the middle of May.  Sincerely,;38.7947;-82.9285999999994
Bright yellow light would dim and brighten itself. Hovered quickly across the sky back and forth.;2008-07-06 02:00:00;45 mins;Bright yellow light would dim and brighten itself. Hovered quickly across the sky back and forth. Me and my friends were on our way back from Columbus, OH to Portsmouth, OH driving south on 23. When almost to Chillicothe, my friend with me in the back seat mentioned that he had been watching a strange light in the sky for a couple of minutes. Out of curiosity, we all looked. It was a bright, yellowish light, far brighter than any star in the sky. It seemed to be at high altitude, but I can't be positive as we could easily see it move back and forth ahead of us. During the first 10 minutes of observing, it would be bright and then dim itself until you could not see it anymore. It would then light itself back up in a different area of the sky than it was before. After the 'cycles' it stayed brightly lit and hovered around. We seemed to get fairly close to it at times while driving, but not close enough to identify a shape. My friends claimed to see a seperate light protude from it at one point, but I did not witness this as I was sitting on the other side of the backseat during that time. We lost it when we got into town and it was too foggy to see the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));38.7947;-82.9285999999994
More Info on Portsmouth Bright-Dim Lights.;2008-07-06 22:00:00;20 min;More Info on Portsmouth Bright-Dim Lights. This is in response to the Portsmouth, Ohio UFO sighting on July 6, Posted Aug. 12. The one with the yellow light that breightens, dims, and darts across the sky.   This has happened more than once.  My wife and I have seen a yellow-copper light that gets incredibly bright and dims into nothing only to reappear miles away a second later.  Over the last few years it actually seems to happen on a random but regular basis over the skys of western and northern scioto sounty.   I've heard many other people speak of lights like this as well, mostly in western scioto county. It has been relatively well know that Ohio 73 through northwest Scito county is somewhat of a local UFO spotting hotspot.  In addition to these lights, one night last year my wife and I saw a light and a silent chevron shaped object flew overhead and into the copper light, where the chevron object seemingly disapeared.

Bright dim light seen from the Carl Perkins bridge during 4th of July fireworks show;2010-07-04 22:00:00;half hour;Bright dim light seen from the Carl Perkins bridge during 4th of July fireworks show My girlfriend and i witnessed a light that would brighten and dim. I was also moving very slowly and at times not at all. It would be very bright and a few minutes later it would be very dim, and fade to nothing at all only to brighten back up or be somewhere else. We were on the Carl Perkins bridge waiting for the 4th of July fireworks to start. We first saw it at twilight in the northeast at 50 to 75 feet up. We managed to catch a picture of it as well. We watched it for maybe 10 minutes as it brightened and dimmed and wondered up and down, side to side. The color of the light was orangeish. As the show started, the light wandered to the east and parked above the grant bridge (but much farther out). Again it would wander about dim, brighten, ascend and descend. We also caught it on camera a few more times during the show as my Girlfriend was taking photos of the show. The photos was shot on a Sanyo s1070 with iso speed 200, exposure time 4 sec, focal length 7mm, max ap 2.97  After the show, we dumped the pics onto our computer and quickly forgot about the whole thing. We wew on this site looking at a report i had made several years back about spinning stars when i saw the report entitled: 7/6/08 22:00 	Portsmouth 	OH 	Light 	20 min 	More Info on Portsmouth Bright-Dim Lights. 	10/31/08 7/6/08 02:00 	Portsmouth 	OH 	Light 	45 mins 	Bright yellow light would dim and brighten itself. Hovered quickly across the sky back and forth. We know the photos are not great, but we were lucky to have caught them in the first place.  When trying to photo it, we couldn't see it in the lcd view screen and assumed we would be able to capture it.  So she set her camera to a longer exposure and sure enough we caught it several times.  We would ask that anyone viewing the photos understand that it wasnt the easy to photograph due to the nature of the light. I am also making the exact location on google earth with photos if it helps.  Here are the coords:  38°43'36.22N 83° 1'2.46W;38.7947;-82.9285999999994
3 Orange/red Orbs in the sky early morning Christmas Day 2013 in Portsmouth, Ohio.;2013-12-25 00:30:00;5 minutes;3 Orange/red Orbs in the sky early morning Christmas Day 2013 in Portsmouth, Ohio. Roughly 0030 on Christmas Day myself and my kids we're driving through Portsmouth,  Oh on our way to Kentucky to visit family.  While driving through Portsmouth, Ohio, my eldest son had noticed 3 orbs in the sky that were orange/red in color.  I pulled over to the side of the road and all of us got out of the vehicle to get a better view.  The orbs/craft were flying side-by-side in a line formation.  They seemed to be gliding through the sky smoothly. There was no sound that I could hear coming from the crafts.  They were roughly 800-1500 feet in the air.  We watched them for about 2min, that's was when they faded in the clouds and disappeared.  This is the first time I've seen anything remotely looking like a UFO.   I've been in the military going on 20yrs and I've been around just about every type of aircraft known to the military.  I know what aircraft sound like and how they move, and this was something that I've never seen before.  But I'm glad I had the chance to experience this with my children because we are all believers.;38.7947;-82.9285999999994

Several bright orange orbs seen glowing and dimming around each other;2017-10-19 20:15:00;15 minutes;Several bright orange orbs seen glowing and dimming around each other A series of extremely bright orange lights appeared and reappeared at different points close to each other.  Approximately 6 different lights were seen.  This was the brightest, prettiest colors I have ever seen.   I was traveling north on US-23 when I saw them to the west.  I slowed to nearly 30mph to observe them as they put on what seemed like a show.  They then all went dark.   I traveled approximately 15 miles farther down the highway when they appeared again, but this time only two or three lights were there.  They glowed and dimmed for approximately 30 seconds before finally disappearing not to be seen again.;38.7947;-82.9285999999994
