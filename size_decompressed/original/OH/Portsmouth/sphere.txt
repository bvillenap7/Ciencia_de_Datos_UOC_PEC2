Bright white, round light swells in size and then dissapears completely.;2004-11-11 21:54:00;30 seconds;Bright white, round light swells in size and then dissapears completely. I attend evening classes at my local college and as I was driving home from class, I saw a bright light that appeared out of no where in the sky. It started out about the size of a golf ball (as if there were an illuminated golf ball outside my vehicle. It was clearly much larger than a star. The object rapidly swelled to several times its regular size as if going from the size of a grape to the size of a grapefruit) Immediately after it swelled, it dissapeared completely. A friend saw some weird red lights in the sky a few days later. There has definately been some weird things happening in the sky here.;38.7947;-82.9285999999994
