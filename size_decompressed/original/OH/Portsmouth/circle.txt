Well this is what I remember, because I didn't know I could report a sighting on the internet!  It started with one white circular object that came out of almost nowhere and dropped above a tree on a corner of my girlfriends street.  The tree is proably 30 feet high and the craft hovered about 20 feet above that.  It sent down 4 beams of light to the street and just stayed there.  My girlfriend and I noticed darker squares or rectangles towards the middle of the circle.  After hovering with NO NOISE for about 20 seconds it lifted slowly then bolted out of sight.  It flew up first then down then out of sight. After this I was a bit excited and looked towards the skies.  Out of nowhere a triangular shape came into focus.  It was a pulsing red color and then as it got closer and in front of us it turned BRIGHT WHITE.  We saw about 15 of these, that came from the same direction, SE.  About 5 of the craft seem to flow back and forth, and change altitudes the other 10 just flew straight.  All started red, then proceeded to change to white.  I tried to put it all of this off as maybe a helicopter for the hovering object and maybe just some military aircraft for the other 15 but it just didn't seem right.  All were color changing (red to white for the triangles, and white with small dark squares or rectangles for the hovering craft) and seem to just handle much better than military aircraft. We called the local police and guess what the craft stopped coming, so the police thought we were crazy.  Maybe I was just exaduating, but to me this was more odd than usual.
