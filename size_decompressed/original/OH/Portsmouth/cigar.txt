White Cigar Shape-Daytime;2002-11-20 15:00:00;2 minutes;White Cigar Shape-Daytime I was out video taping chemtrails at 1500 hours and I noticed this cigar shaped object with the sun reflecting off of it. I heard no sound. I moved about as fast as a jet. I video taped, cut a photo from the video and enlarged the photo. A white cylinder cigar shaped object. There was no trail. An hour later that day I saw another object in the sky in the same place but this time I heard a jet engine. This second object was just a jet. This was when I realized the first object was not normal.;38.7947;-82.9285999999994
oblong glowing blue light in the north, then the north east;2003-01-09 22:30:00;3-5 seconds;oblong glowing blue light in the north, then the north east While out on my porch, I happened to look up in to the sky in the northern direction. There was a long, almost hotdog shaped blue boject in the sky at about maybe 50 degrees.  it was the same color blue as the base of a flame with one part of it brighter than the rest.  it stayed lit in the sky for about 1 1/2 seconds then dissapeared.  About 5 seconds later I saw the same thing but now in the north-eastern part of the sky at about the same degree.  Whatever it was produced no sound nor did it blink.  It was just a steady glowing blue hotdog shape of light. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and found her to be credible.  PD));38.7947;-82.9285999999994
