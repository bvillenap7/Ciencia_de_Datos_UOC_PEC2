As I was looking at the moon in the east, I saw a bright orange object spherical object that seemed to be on fire pass in front of the moon.  It rose up over the house and water tower directly across the street from me.  There was no sound. At first I thought it must be a hot air ballon on fire because of what appeared to be flames around it, but because it kept on going on in a controlled flight to the south and up in the sky.  I thought is must be a plane on fire but that didn't make any sense because a plane would have fallen. I ran in the house to get my I-phone and ran back out to take the first picture and could still see the distinct shape and bright orange color but it had gained considerable altitude and distance. In the next immediate shot it was out of sight.  I checked to see if any satellites had been launched but there were none on that day.  This is my first sighting of such an object, although I have seen others UFO's one very very close and others in the sky the looking distinctly like stars but definitely not acting like stars and witnessed by a crowd of people.  I saw the last space shuttle launch and this looked nothing like it.  I have 2.5 Maste'rs degrees in education.  I am an elementary school teacher of 37 years and teach all subjects.  I have a 2 photos of the object.;39.3433909909915;-84.4009141891887
