My husband's softball game ended, then walking to the car I noticed this very very bright star for about 10 sec. I could see apprx 5 other stars and this one was about 20 x brighter than Venus. There was a plane that was going across that had the regular red & blue blinking lights on the wings. But this wasn't moving. Anyway the next 5 sec it faded to abslutely nothing.;39.3433909909915;-84.4009141891887
Light's in the sky;2002-09-27 20:15:00;5 to 10 seconds;Light's in the sky As I was waiting to start my shift I was sitting on te dock watching the planes flying over head into cincinnati northen KY airport, mind you they have a flight line that is east to west, that puts them right over my place of work. Nothing was going over head at the time because planes make noise, then I just happen to look up looking north east and I saw two bright lights for about 5 to 10 secound's, but I heard no sounds like a plane would make then they just went away, also it was a clear night! star all over the place this was my first time ever seeing something like this.

Bright, white light in the sky in West Chester, OH 9/11/09 at 7:05am.;2009-09-11 07:05:00;20 sec.;Bright, white light in the sky in West Chester, OH 9/11/09 at 7:05am. I was driving to work this morning heading south on I-75, when I looked out the window and noticed a very bright, white light moving slowly in the sky.  For perspective, I was looking diagonally in line with the Home Depot you can see off I-75 near the Tylersville Rd. exit.  I waited for the it to start blinking like airplane lights do, but it never did.  The light source definitely was emanating from the object and not the ground.  I watched it for about 20 seconds, then briefly turned my attention to the traffic, when I looked for it again it was gone.  I scanned the sky saw a speck of it miles away now on the other side of the highway.  Then gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Four light orbs that disappeared and reappeared in West Chester, OH 7/16/10   ((NUFORC Note:  See note below from MUFON FI.  PD));2010-07-16 21:40:00;5 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to Jim Strausbaugh, MUFON FI ID 12701, for sharing the benefit of his investigation into this matter with NUFORC.  PD)) Four light orbs that disappeared and reappeared in West Chester, OH 7/16/10 UFO Sighting July 16, 2010 in West Chester, Ohio   At approximately 9:40pm at XXXX Ridgetop Drive, Cincinnati, OH, I and two friends were walking out of Monster Golf towards the parking lot when to the North, we saw orbs in the sky above a dark, wooded area. These lights were yellow in color and there were 4 of them.  They were all floating in a straight, diagonal line.  Slowly, one by one the lights began to disappear until there was only one left.  Then, the lights all started to reappear one by one until there were 4 again.   All while this pattern was happening, the whole formation was moving downwards.  After watching it for about a minute, it eventually reached down to the earth but we couldn’t see it anymore as it was hid by the trees.  Every 5 seconds or so, a faint yellow light was seen behind the trees, as if the UFO had landed. We know it can’t be planes or helicopters because planes do not flicker their lights on and off, they do not maintain this weird formation, and there is no runway near this location.   Lantern kites were also ruled out because like I said, they don’t just flicker on and off, and they were high in the sky.   We can’t explain this unusual event, but I hope I’ve given enough information.   A few other witnesses in the parking lot also saw this scene.

9 Lights Seen;2012-06-03 00:00:00;2 minutes;9_Lights_Sieen At 22:26 PM, on June 3, 2012, I was traveling south on Hamilton Mason Road, when my 12 year old daughter asked what those lights in the sky were. I glanced out my driver’s window and saw 5 very bright yellow-orange lights in the sky.  At first I believed them to be a very close aircraft but then the fourth light flew very fast under the third light. I was trying to drive and look at them which made the difficult for me to watch.  I then looked south in the sky and saw 4 other lights traveling south at average speed.  To my surprise, I looked back at the original 5 and they all but disappeared heading toward the moon.  They were just a very distant light. I hurried down my street and into the driveway and watched the last two head towards the moon and just blinked out. I am not sure what I saw but the lights we saw were too big and appeared far to bright to be aircraft. The color on them was odd as well.  At the rate they disappeared was far too fast to be any aircraft I am aware of.  The windows were down and I heard no odd noise, only traffic. I can’t believe these lights were of this earth.;39.3433909909915;-84.4009141891887
One yellow light that split into four the reunited over Butler County Ohio.;2013-10-12 21:00:00;~1 minute;One yellow light that split into four the reunited over Butler County Ohio. 	On the evening of Saturday, October 12 2013, I was coming out of IKEA in West Chester, Ohio, with my fiancé when we noticed something strange in the sky.  It was approximately 9 pm, the store was closing and we were walking to the car.  I noticed a yellowish light in the sky that was brighter and bigger then any star or plane lights that I have ever seen.  I pointed to it immediately and ask my fiancé if he saw it and if it was moving.  We stopped walking so we could be sure, and it was definitely moving. It was strangely shaped, kind of a longer shape, positioned vertically.  It was at about a 40-degree angle in the sky to the north, but it was rising slowly and moving around, kind of back and forth.  As we were watching it, it split into 4 different equally sized lights it seemed to me that three of them were flying erratically around the fourth.  They didn’t move far away from each other.  It seemed like it lasted about 10-15 seconds before the lights all came back together as one and then blinked out. Seeing as how we had never seen anything like this before, we were in shock and didn’t take our eyes from the sky.  It’s a good thing we didn’t because what seemed like maybe 10 seconds later it reappeared again, a single light, just about in what seemed to be the same place and size as before.  As we watched it this time it split into 3 lights and they flew around each other again.  But this time it didn’t seem that there was one in the center that they all flew around, but again, they didn’t get far from each other.  It didn’t seem to last as long as the first time they split apart.  Like the first time, they merged back into one, hovered for a moment and then kind of blinked out. We watched for a few minutes, and then decided to drive away from the parking lot lights towards it to try and see it again, but no luck.  Also we tried to get video with my phones camera, but unfortunately the parking lot lights in IKEA were too bright, and you couldn’t even see it on my phone at all.;39.3433909909915;-84.4009141891887
At around 10:30 PM we saw an aircraft as a pinpoint of solid red light that eventually oscillated to blue and then back to red. It;2018-08-02 22:30:00;20 minutes;At around 10:30 PM, we saw an aircraft as a pinpoint of solid red light that eventually oscillated to blue and then back to red.  It was mostly a solid red light that did not flash.  It remained stationary in the sky at about a 75 degree angle off the horizon then it would rush back and forth from left to right then up and down a short distance then settle back into a stationary position.  This pattern of movement, then the cessation of movement, lasted about twenty minutes.  It came closer to us before it slowly dropped straight down behind the line of trees ahead of our location.  I saw the solid red light through the trees as it seemed to continue toward the ground. This occurred along side I-75 to the north and slightly east of the highway. We were on the patio of our house when we noticed this strange light and it’s odd behavior. three people watched this craft.  We could not hear anything although we live next to the highway and that could prevent any sound from reaching us. At any time there are many airplanes visible in the sky.  This was not a conventional airplane. Wright Pat AFB is about 50 miles north of us and we do see and hear military craft overhead occasionally. The craft likely had at least two separate lights.  When the blue light came on the red light would go off. The blue light would remain solid for a while then switch to the red light.  At a couple of points, the lights would flash back and forth more rapidly, then remain solid again.;39.3433909909915;-84.4009141891887
