There were four flying objects that were lit up flying side by side.  About every 10 seconds the lights would simultaneously go out on all four vessels.  After a couple minutes, I glanced in my driver's side mirror and all four blew up like colorful fireworks and disappeared.  Thank God for this beautiful sight!;39.3433909909915;-84.4009141891887
