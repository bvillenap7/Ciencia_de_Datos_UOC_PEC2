I looked to the western sky and seen some lights I asked my wife and kids to look and they also seen them.  We watched 3 light on the far right side of the formation moving together to the north.   They stopped after going so far and reverse direction from where they came from and stopped like as they were forming a certain formation.   The formation was like a check mark, and all of a sudden one light disappears and then another now there is 1 then the lights come back on (like a light switch) then there was 5 lights. the length was very long unlike no plane or hot air balloons they moved too quickly.  My wife and kids were freaked out and let it be known my don’t believe in ufo’s but even she says she can’t explain what we saw.;39.3433909909915;-84.4009141891887

Their formation slowly morphed and moved to a more complete arc.  A little higher up in the sky I saw two balls of light that were separate from the other pack. I took a video of the event and am willing to share .;39.3433909909915;-84.4009141891887
