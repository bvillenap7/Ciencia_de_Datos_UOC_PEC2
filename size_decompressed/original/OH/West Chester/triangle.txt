traingular craft with array of bright lights silently gliding near treeline;2007-09-21 20:00:00;3 minutes;traingular craft with array of bright lights silently gliding near treeline On Friday night, September 21st  around 8:00pm, my husband and I were taking our evening walk when I spotted something to the east flying low in the sky. It caught my eye because the lights were getting brighter, but as we stopped to look at a triangular object flying silently and low in the sky at dusk, we realized we were seeing the lights brighten as it showed it belly. It turned and the lights dimmed and at one point seemed like a horizontal line of lights. We were seeing it from the side or horizontal plane.  The cluster of lights were very bright, about 6 sets of lights that looked like an array to me, but my husband’s better vision detected an outline and many lights that formed the array. It wasn’t in any hurry and seemed to glide above the clouds and took it’s time making its way south along the tree line. We lost sight of it so we jumped in our car trying to anticipate where it had gone.  Unfortunately, we were unable to locate it again and since then we’ve been scouring the internet trying to find others in our area of West Chester, Ohio who may have also seen it. I’m an office manager of 3.5 years for the Cincinnati Branch of an international company and my husband is a crew member of a predominant builder her in Cincinnati.  We knew we wouldn’t hear about it on the news as in such a free country as ours, we’re not allowed to be made aware of things like this en masse. But we know what we saw and we’ll continue evaluating the skies at night hoping to see the craft again.  Funny, that we stepped into a store today that was showing video footage and telling a news story that a similar craft was sighted recently in Mexico.  Maybe next time I’ll have my video cam / digital camera with me to capture the proof.;39.3433909909915;-84.4009141891887
Bright Triangular Shaped Craft;2007-09-21 20:14:00;25 minutes;Bright Triangular Shaped Craft On 9/21/07 at  8:14 PM , my 2 daughters were outside playing w/friends. I heard screams & looked outside my window to find out what the comotion was about. I saw no one. Seconds later my kids ran into my apartment screaming,  Daddy, it's a UFO in the sky!. Being that I live near Wright Patterson Air Force base, I figured it must be some kind of military plane. I rushed to the porch balcony followed by my childeren. What I saw next, I could not believe. I live right along 75 south in between Dayton & Cincinnati so I know for a fact I was looking Southeast. In the distant sky, among small engine aircrafts that normally fly in this area, I noticed what seemed to be 3 white dots followed by a red dot in a train type fashion moving through the night sky towards the South east. I would estimate the altitude as being than that of a low flying commercial plane. I tried to get a picture w/my cell phone but the lighting was terrible. Seconds later, the dots seemed as if they completely changed directions. Instead of moving away from me they were now moving towards my apartment balcony. After changing directions, whatever it was stopped & hovered left to right. It was the weirdest movement I have ever seen any craft make. After hovering for a few seconds the dots turned into about 9 bright lights that together formed a triangle. Surrounding each individual bright light was a bright white outline of a triangle. The complete triangle turned at an angle then, like a firecraker exploded & the bright dots inside the triangle burst into clusters & then turned red! The red remnats then formed a huge semicircle in the sky.The aircraft towers in the area all turned red. Two airplanes that looked & sounded like the military vehicles that usually frequent the area were observed passing shortly therafter. The night sky, which had been pretty active up until I saw the last of what I thought to be military vehicles, was now silent!  If this was some kind of prank, I wish someone would tell me!

Dark colored wing seen heading South-Southeast from Old Station Rd and Oregon Pass.  Wing executed ~120 degree turn almost instantly;2008-06-20 19:30:00;1-3 minutes;Dark colored wing seen heading South-Southeast from Old Station Rd and Oregon Pass.  Wing executed ~120 degree turn almost instantly This is in posted spurred by, and possibly related to, the 6/21/08 sighting at 3:45 am in West Chester.  Sighting happened some time that same week (can't remember exact day with 100% certainty, but I think it was Friday 6/20), at around dusk.  I was driving home from work.  Initially spotted craft on Old Station Rd, and kept observing it as I drove down Oregon Pass.  I saw a black (or at least dark colored) wing initially heading roughly south-southeast.  Wing executed roughly 120 degree turn within an estimated few hundred feet without banking or slowing down, and proceeded over horizon line.  Light arrays looked like running lights I've seen on conventional wings (eg. B-2, Boeing's U.A.V.), but I've never seen a wing turn that fast before.  I've not even seen vectored thrust aircraft turn that fast before.  Speed was roughly similar to twin-engine private jets I've seen operating in the airspace.  No noise that I could hear, but it also appeared to be high and the engine on my truck is loud and windows were up.  As a note, there is an ultralight pilot who flies regularly in the area.  He usually operates in the morning and early afternoon, but I've seen him flying around just before dusk once.  Ultralight is small, low, slow, and brightly colored (mostly white) and makes a buzzing/humming noise when it's close.  It often looks like it's hovering if viewed from a distance.  What I saw was higher, faster, darker and bigger than the ultralight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

Triangular aircraft with green and red lights;2019-07-04 22:05:00;5 minutes;Triangular aircraft with green and red lights Shortly after 10pm on July 4th, 2019, I observed an unusual object in the south by southwest sky at about a 40-50 degree elevation from West Chester, Ohio. It caught my attention because the usual object first appeared to be perfectly still and did not show any characteristics associated with a helicopter.   Later, it moved south at what appeared to be an extraordinarily high rate of speed.   When it accelerated, I believe I heard a faint, very low frequency rumbling.  Otherwise, there was no sound associated with the object. The object featured three lights in a triangular pattern.  When I looked at the object through binoculars, I could clearly see that one of the lights was a steady red and two were alternating between green and red.  The alternation occurred on a regular basis changing roughly once per second.  There was no evidence of landing lights on the aircraft, and through the binoculars I could make out what appeared to be a triangle. Yes, this was on the Fourth of July. But this clearly was not any kind of firework.  I also found it odd that if this was a research aircraft of some type, that it would be flying on a night when so many people would be looking up towards the sky.  10pm is a typical time for fireworks displays in this area. My son and wife also saw the same object.  My son also observed it through the binoculars.;39.3433909909915;-84.4009141891887
