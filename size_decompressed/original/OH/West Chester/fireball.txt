I went into my house and, after about 15 minutes of pondering what I had seen, I called the sheriff's office.  The person I spoke to said that they had received a lot of calls and that what everybody was seeing was just part of a meteor shower.  It was an evening when the Leonids were supposed to be visible, but it was my understanding that this was only in the eastern sky.  This really large, object moved parallel to the horizen, from west to east. (I'm writing this 7 months after the event I keep thinking about what I saw!);39.3433909909915;-84.4009141891887

Fireball object seen in West Chester, OH. Strange flight pattern.;2013-09-02 20:15:00;15 minutes;Fireball object seen in West Chester, OH. Strange flight pattern. Seen at dusk, the object traveled slowly through the sky. It was orangish yellow.  The light went out a couple of times and then came back but the object was still visible as a black spot.  At one point it seemed as if it dripped a flame or spark. It did not make any noise whatsoever.  A large plane was also seen quickly after the object disappeared, maybe some type of investigation plane.  I've set up a dropbox folder account with the video files I took of it.  https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mtmcv46nm231vog/zZHWxnnd3u;39.3433909909915;-84.4009141891887

My wife and I were standing outside, watching neigborhood fireworks displays, and during that time, we witnessed several orange balls of light traveling from West to East in seemingly low altitude.  They traveled in a single file line one right after the other.  I took two videos about 3 minutes long on each.   You can contact me for these videos.;39.3433909909915;-84.4009141891887
