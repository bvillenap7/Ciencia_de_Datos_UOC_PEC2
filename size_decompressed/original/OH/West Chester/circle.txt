9 orange-red circles in the western sky that faded out over 10 minutes.;2013-11-19 20:15:00;10 minutes;9 orange-red circles in the western sky that faded out over 10 minutes. My wife got home from work around 8:15pm.  She came in and asked me to come outside to see something.   I walked outside barefoot into the cold and looked up to see 9 lights in the sky.  We were looking to the western sky.   The crafts were an orangish red color and circular.  There were no light tails, just the colored balls.  8 of them were grouped together, 4 on top and 4 on bottom flying south (left).  They were not in perfect formation.  The 9th craft was flying the opposite direction to the north (right). About a minute after observing 4 of the crafts flying south faded out quickly like they had started flying further west out of sight or just disappeared.  Similarly the one flying north had disappeared as well.   The remaining 4 flew slower still south a few more minutes.  The one going north that had gone away reappeared and changed course to go south.  The 4 others faded out like the first 4 had withing 10 seconds. I then tracked the one remaining that had re-appeared and turned south for 2 minutes.  It got brighter for a about 20 seconds like it might be getting closer then it did the same as the others.  It took about 10 seconds and faded out. I watched the skies for another 5 minutes and did not see another light.  I dont know how anyone outside in west chester at that time could miss it.  I would love to know if anyone else saw this or what it could be.  This experience was amazing to me.   I tried to take a video with my wife's phone but it was pretty blurry.  I could provide it if wanted by this site's directors/investigators.;39.3433909909915;-84.4009141891887
