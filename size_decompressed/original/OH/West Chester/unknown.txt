Flashes of light in the northern sky that lasted about 30min around 10PM on 10/11/14.;2014-10-11 22:00:00;30 minutes;Flashes of light in the northern sky that lasted about 30min around 10PM on 10/11/14. Around 10PM, we noticed a fixed point of light in the sky facing north.  The light looked like a star then periodically would flash a very bright light in an irregular timing pattern however the flash looked the same each time.  The flash flashed a beam of light simultaneously from the top and bottom of the object for 1 second, nothing form either side though.  After the flash was gone, you could see the fixed star looking object in the middle as if it were the point of origin.   This behavior continued for about 30 minutes.  The last few flashes became dimmer and dimmer until it was completely gone.;39.3433909909915;-84.4009141891887
