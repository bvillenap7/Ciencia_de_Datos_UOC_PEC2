My brother had walked outside to his truck when he spotted a very bright light in the sky. He called me and my husband to take a look at it. We watched it for awhile and it was a white/gold color. The lights seemed to pulsate. It was very low to the ground, so ran and got my telescope. We couldn't see anything other than a very bright shining light with different colors. As we watched it for a few minutes it disappeared.  We kept looking in the sky and a few minutes later it appeared in the north western sky a little higher than before. As we watched it it became brighter with changing colors than totally vanished. I don't know what we saw, but I know for sure it was not an airplane.  The object stood stationary for quite sometime and then just disappeared and than reappeared in  another part of the sky.  There were no markers,flasher of any kind, and no sound.  I would really like to have this one explained to me.;41.1431;-81.4416
