Object seen 3-14-01 changing shape and size in Northeast Ohio;2001-03-14 20:30:00;3 Min;Object seen 3-14-01 changing shape and size in Northeast Ohio Object appeared to have 2 small detached red flashing lights directly above and below. Both lights weaved and pitched and acted as they were attached by long springs. The object itself was an undefined oval glow of light which I witnessed changing in size and shape several times. Usualy increasing in size tenfold. It would appear to stop while changing, turning a bright blue/white light. I would guess the altitude of the object to be under 600ft. traveling in a zig-zag motion from the north and heading south.;41.1431;-81.4416
