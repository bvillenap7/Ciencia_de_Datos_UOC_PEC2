I thoug;2002-12-08 04:30:00;Not Known;I was away for a weekend on a hunting trip when my companion and I retired for the evening.  I was in my sleeping bag at 10 pm. I thought I was dreaming, however, my companion told me when he got up the next morning that I was gone and did not see me until Monday (12/9) at about 9am. I can not account for my physical disappearance. I have a cloudy recollection of a dream.  It seemed that I was in a room with two other persons.  One was a man who identified himself as Jake and the other was a woman.  The woman seemed disoriented. There was another man present a small dark figure.  I think he called the other person gayban.  They took me into a room and I recall feeling strange sensations. This is all I can remember.  I did have some strange marks on my neck and chest area. My companion told me I should report this on your site.
