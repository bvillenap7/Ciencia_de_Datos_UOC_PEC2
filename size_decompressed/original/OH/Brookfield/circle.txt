Bright object in sky hovering for hours;2019-10-06 02:00:00;4 hours;Bright object in sky hovering for hours Bright Light over Brookfield, Ohio,  Sunday, October 6, 2019 1:53 PM  About a month ago, I was walking down my hall toward the kitchen.  As I was passing the hallway window, a very bright object caught the corner of my eye.  I looked and witnessed a very bright floating object in the East toward Sharon, Pa.  It hovered for hours and as morning came, it was more toward a SE position.   This morning around 2:ooam, I seen the object again in about the same position in the sky as last time.  I got out my husband's cell phone and took pictures with video only to find that it is 2 objects or it has something connected to it.  It does change position with the other object as the night goes on.  I hope I am not seeing a satellite that is to hover over a certain area.  I don't see this object every night though.  It comes about every 2 days or so.  Surprised no one has seen it or if they have, we haven't heard anything about it.  It is very bright.;41.2482;-80.5795
