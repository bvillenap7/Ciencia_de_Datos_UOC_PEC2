Flashing lights in New Washington, Ohio.;2013-03-10 21:30:00;2 hours?;Flashing lights in New Washington, Ohio When we 1st saw it, was straight down the street like a bright star, then as we watched it we saw many smaller lights going and coming toward the larger light.  Then we saw the red light flutering around in no real direction.  The main light was there for several hours. Several weeks before this my daughter and I were leaving a family members house about 9:00 pm and we saw a very bright light at the other end of their street.  As we drove it seemed to be cutting across the field as we did. As we got onto our road it was crossing the field and by our house. By the time we got to our street closer to our home it was over the nieghbors field above the barn about 40 feet. There seemed to be many colored lights going off and on in a circle patteren and then there was 2 very bright orangeish lights that were brighter and more like search lights. I stopped and rolled my window down that there wasn't any sounds at all. It was only maybe 60 feet above us. It didn't move for awhile. We got into the house  and watched it from in the window and it moved very slowly and disappeared in about 2 minutes.;40.9556;-82.8455
