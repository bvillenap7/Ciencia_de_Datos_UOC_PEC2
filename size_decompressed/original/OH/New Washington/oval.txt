White oval (thought it was a street light at first).;1972-10-01 20:00:00;2 minutes;White oval (thought it was a street light at first). It was in the early 70's, a Wednesday night during the school year, around 8-8:30.  One of my sisters and I were standing on our patio talking after a class we had attended.   There was a street light about 50 yards from our porch.  I don’t know what possessed us to look in that direction but we both saw what appeared to be another street light directly above the real one, only higher, above the trees.  It just sat there.   There was no noise and I don't know how long it had been there.  It was a white oval—it looked just like the street light.   My sister ran into the house to get the camera, and as soon as she held it up to take a picture, the craft sped out of sight.
