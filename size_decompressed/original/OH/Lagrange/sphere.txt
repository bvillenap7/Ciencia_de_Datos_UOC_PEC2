Ball of light follows train track. Witness farid (he/she) would be late for work.  ((MUFON report));2018-04-05 08:20:00;10-15 seconds;Ball of light follows train track. Witness farid (he/she) would be late for work. Witness was driving to work down a country road and noticed a fast moving ball of light following a train track.  Thinking it was a train the witness groaned, hoping not to be late for work.  But looking again it was apparently just a ball of light that followed the tracks and disappeared.  It seemed to disappear into the horizon toward the sun, but when it was observed, it was definitely a ball of light.  There was a person in a car in front of this witness who must have seen it as well, but they did not communicate nor did the witness get a license plate number.  This lasted only about 10 - 15 seconds, tops, but it was the oddest thing I've ever seen in my life. 10-15 secs. (MUFON};41.2392;-82.1249
