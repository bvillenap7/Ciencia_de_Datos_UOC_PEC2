7 fireballs in populated residential area in single file formation just 500 ft over our heads, spotted by 3 witnesses.;2010-08-10 22:00:00;4-5 minutes;7 fireballs in populated residential area in single file formation just 500 ft over our heads, spotted by 3 witnesses. A year and a half ago I was leaving my gf's house around 10pm to go get some fast food.  When I stepped outside I saw some lights off the in the distance and it was dark so they were easy to spot.  At first they were kinda far away so after 30 seconds or so I realized I was looking at 7 fireball spheres of plasma energy in single file formation spaced 1 after another spaced about 100-200 ft apart from one another.  They were about 6 ft in diameter going a slow 15-20 mph just floating over my head not more than 500 ft off the ground in a crowded residential area with a shopping mall just a few miles away. They looked like miniature suns, u could see inside it and realize there was no machinery whatsoever. It was all swirling fiery plasma, like a liquid lava lamp but being powered by a nuclear furnace. When I realized what I was witnessing, I knew I had no camera so the next best thing would be witnesses so I ran back inside and my gfs mom was watching survivor and I told her she had to come see this so she goes out and cant believe her eyes so my gf is all the way inside and up in her bedroom so I have to run up and tell her theres ufos outside u gotta hurry if ure going to see them.  When she made it outside she got to see the last 3 or 4 floating off. I have been a huge believer in ufos before my sighting but my gfs mother is a catholic who doesnt like science fiction at all.  She would be the least likely person ever to believe in et's but she does now.  There is a local tv stations antennae just north of us in the direction the orbs were going.

Orange fireballs were traveling slowly 30 feet off the ground.;2011-03-15 15:00:00;15 seconds;Orange fireballs were traveling slowly 30 feet off the ground. I am reporting what a friend told me about a year ago.  We never had much contact through the years but when he called me I could tell in his voice that what he saw was genuine.  He called me immediately because he knows I'm into this kind of thing. He saw 5 fireballs all in a row. They were about 30 feet off the ground traveling due north at about 20 mph.  He also described them as plasma balls. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.0158;-80.8041
