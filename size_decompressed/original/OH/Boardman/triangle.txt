Walking on a bike path at dusk after a light rain, I looked up into the dark sky and noticed a golden triangle flying quickly under the clouds as they broke up after the rain.  It appeared to be approximately 800 feet up in the air and seemed to be the size of a large jet, yet making no sound.   As it approached from the West and traveled East, it seemed to be shaking rather violently under the clouds.  After coming to a COMPLETE STOP under the breaking clouds, the golden triangle slowly rotated approximately 90 degrees while remaining relatively stationary, pointed its apparent nose up at an angle, and shot up between the open clouds and out of sight into the night sky within mere seconds!;41.0158;-80.8041
