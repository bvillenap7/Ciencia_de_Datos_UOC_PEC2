Diamond-shaped object emitted small red spheres while travelling in a stop/start triangular pattern.;2017-06-02 22:45:00;5 minutes;Diamond shaped object emitted small red spheres while travelling in a stop/start triangular pattern After leaving a local movie theater at 10:45 at night, my wife and I looked up into the eastern sky and noticed a strange, bright white diamond shaped object, traveling along and then stopping in the eastern night sky.  It appeared to be approximately 3,000 feet up at an 90 degree angle to us.  The object then proceeded to flash multiple colors, and move in a triangular-like pattern in the sky, stopping and emitting what looked like a small red light sphere that traveled in a lower altitude away from the stopped object and quickly disappeared from view.   This happened three times over the course of a few minutes.   Approximately 5 minutes after the event started, it had stopped, and the bright white diamond shaped object disappeared to the East in a cloud bank.;41.0158;-80.8041
