Thinking it could of been some sort of plane we continued driving.  The light hovered in the sky above the road and we saw another orange bright light around the area of the other one.  We could not make out any shape due to the darkness so we decided to pull over in a bare parking lot right up the road.  The whole drive to the parking lot this light just hovered and was slowly moving. As we pulled into the parking lot we watch this light slowly moving above us and another couple pulled into the parking lot and parked next to us.  We tried hard to make out any type of shape but the light was so bright it was like a airplane high in the sky, but there was no indication of sound and the way it hovered as if it wasnt moving.  We were talking to each other for a split second and when we looked up to continue watching it, the light took off.;41.0158;-80.8041
