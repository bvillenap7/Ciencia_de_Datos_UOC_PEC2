V  formation of lights;2008-07-15 22:00:00;1-2 minutes;V  formation of lights At appox. 10 PM in July of 2008, I am not sure of the exact day, I was walking in the Walmart parking lot prior to entering the store when I noticed a few people aiming their phones at the sky to take photos.I followed their gaze and observed 6 orangeish red lights flying in a V formation.They seemed to be a fairly good size. 5 lights formed the V and the 6th was on the right end as if to start a downward leg for another V or the letter W. They moved in a Northwest to Southeast direction. They made no sound and I saw no smoke and they kept in perfect formation. They did not blink but seemed to shimmer. Then one by one starting with the leftmost light they just went out in sequence from left to right. They kept in formation while going out. They kept the same altitude during the whole incident and never broke formation. They went out one by one in a very timely manner. I do not know how high they were or how far away but they covered a good distance in their ! travel before going out and they did not drop in altitude during the entire time.
