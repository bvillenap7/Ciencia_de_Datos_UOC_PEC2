Light in the sky;2012-10-24 22:45:00;3 minutes;light in the sky I was outside on the back porch. I was hearing many dogs in the area barking. 10 to 12 I would say.  All around, they were not stopping at all.  My dogs were barking and they were inside the house.  In the western sky I witnessed a light appear.  It was red then white then a light color yellow. And it was rotating in that color scheme very fast.  Right after the light appeared the dogs were all very quiet.  This 1st event lasted 15 seconds.  The light then disappeared.  At first I thought it was a planet but it was not. After the light disappeared my dogs and the other dogs barking like before started up again. This time it seemed louder and more aggressive.  Then the light came back after  45 seconds after the 1st one went out.  All the dogs went very quiet.  This time for only 5 seconds the light was there.  Then it disappeared.  This time the dogs did not bark again and the area became very quiet and there was nothing making a sound.  The entire event was may be 3 m! in in length.  From the dogs barking to the lights coming  and going to the dogs not making a sound.;39.8705;-82.3014
