A fireball in the southwestern hemosphere that was five times the size of a planet that lasted for 60 seconds;2005-09-18 20:30:00;1minute;A fireball in the southwestern hemosphere that was five times the size of a planet that lasted for 60 seconds my friend and I were in a field and looked up into the south west hemosphere and saw a ball of fire about five times the size of mars or a bright planet you would see in the sky.  The ball looked like an explosion from the back of a rocket ship.  It gradually got smaller as it went further away from us.  It lasted for 40 seconds to one minute.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
Orange glowing orb;2013-06-26 01:00:00;<1 minute;It was around 1AM the 26th of June.  I was out late doing laundry at the local laundromat.   While I was waiting I went outside to have a seat on a little bench in the front of the place facing a large grocery store parking lot.  I looked up and noticed a orange glowing orb in the sky.  I thought at first it may have been the moon but it was very bright orange and seemed to be giving off a haze like a fireball but it was behind a cloud.  I was really shocked so after staring at it for about a minute a looked away to get my boyfriend so he could confirm it but by the time I got him outside it was gone.   It should be noted this was in south Dayton near Miamisburg.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251

Fireball/yellow/orange dancing figure hovering, ascending, descending, (slightly) NEAR WPAFB.;2015-04-24 02:30:00;2 hours;Fireball/yellow/orange dancing figure hovering, ascending, descending, (slightly) NEAR WPAFB. I have not posted this until 04/27/15.  The reason being, I like to investigate with nothing less than pure skepticism of my own eyes/thoughts, and try to as thorough as possible before I make a claim as something being unexplainable or being a UFO. 2:30am, I see this yellow/orange, orb/ball of light floating fairly low on the night sky.  I was thinking Jupiter, which I know was visible this night (Venus as well).  I did all the research I could, pictures, astronomical star/planet arrangements for given time and date.  The research kept leading me to convince myself that it was indeed Jupiter.  My gut was saying otherwise.  This object was relatively large compared to any star or planet ive ever observed with the naked eye.  Within the first few moments of observation I had to keep refocusing on this object.  It appeared at times humanoid in figure (arms, torso, head), divine dancing light if you would.  Other times not so much, I rode it off as deceived perception.  Then I kept seeing a flash of light over the right shoulder of the object and this too, rode off as a plane heading to the airport.  Then I saw the flash again, and again, and again.  That's when it really didn't feel natural.  Even if the flash of light was a satellite in fixed position, why was it fixed, was it keeping an eye on this thing?  At the least it was only a satellite interested in this object as well, if not it was from the object itself, either way I don't know.   I know that it aroused me enough to call up a friend near by to check it out as well.  Unfortunately I don't have a camera phone/camera but I did sketch it on the computer with paint.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251

About 20 fireballs seemed to rise from ground in groups of 3-4 rising slow to the west. Then going east after the fire glow stops.;2021-04-09 21:59:00;13 minutes;About 20 fireballs seemed to rise from ground in groups of 3-4 rising slow to the west. Then going east after the fire glow stops. 9:59pm 07/09/2021 I was walking from buying some pizza. As I was walking I looked in the sky to see what looked to be like small fire balls. As I was walking past people porches I asked if that were seeing what was in the sky. They looked at me weird then we were talking about it as we were in disbelief. A little after I started recording with my phone as I still held my pizza. We counted about 20 fire ball looking objects rise from what looked like the surface then slowly moved west in a slow rise. Looking as they were flickering as they moved. They were moving in groups of four and three. As each group of flickering fire ball slowly rising in the sky. They would get to the same area in the sky and the fire looking flickering would stop. Some of the objects seemed to fly back east across the sky when the flickering stopped. This went on for about 13 minutes or so. After I seen that I joked saying if they found some shoes and a pizza box let someone now what we seen. Then I started back walking with my pizza. The sky seemed darker after seeing the objects in the sky. I walked for like 5 minutes. Started seeing a red and white light flashing light in the middle of the sky which seemed like it just stayed stationary in the center of the sky. For some reason I was scared to look at it to long doing so made me feel uneasy. I would just look at the sky from time just to see if it was still there and it was but I would not look at it to long it made me feel uneasy. That’s what I seen will also try to send the video from my iphone as well.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
