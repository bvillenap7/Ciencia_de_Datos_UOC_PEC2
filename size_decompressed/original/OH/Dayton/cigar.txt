Cigar shaped craft outruns fighter jets;1980-04-20 14:00:00;5 Mins;Cigar shaped craft outruns fighter jets I saw what looked like a blimp. Pretty soon 3 fighter jets were headed toward it.  The jets looked like ants compared to the size of the craft.  As the jets got closer the craft started moving away from them.  It was moving very slow then as the jets got close it just disapered.
