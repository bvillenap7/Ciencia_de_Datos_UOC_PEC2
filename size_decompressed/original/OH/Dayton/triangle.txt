There was a bank of intense lights in the front of the triangular, black craft.  What was most spectacular was the absence of any noise.  The second sighting was the same craft landing on an airfield at Wright Patterson AFB.  At 4am two such craft were seen going away from Wright Patterson AFB, again flying very low, soundless and huge, each the size of a football field.  There was a bank of lights on the front of the craft.  These crafts are completely soundless, traveling at a velocity too slow to keep such a vehicle of that size airborn.  This suggests that the military is flying a craft using a new form of propulsion not using fossil fuels.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
3 lights in triangular formation;2004-02-24 23:00:00;10 seconds;3 lights in triangular formation I saw the same 3 lights I saw in November, which I reported on this site.  I wasn't going to submit this one, thinking it must be a satellite or something since I've seen it twice now, but I see that this triangular light formation is becoming increasingly sighted and thought I would submit it because of that reason.  The circular lights were large and white (with possibly a faint yellow hue), flying in a perfect triangular formation. The lights did not blink, but were steady on. This time, there were two lights on the top row, and one on the bottom row, unlike last time when there were two on the bottom and one on top.  It was flying in the same direction as I reported last time, which was Southeast, but they were too far away for me to see if they were on some type of aircraft.  There was no noise.  I just watched them from my bedroom window (same one as last time), having just gone upstairs to get ready for bed.  Could this be a satellite? I can't otherwise explain how I would see the exact same thing going in the same direction, same speed, etc. from my bedroom window twice in 3 months.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251

The lights appeared in the southwest and I thought it was the lights on top of a tower. When we got closer we could see way more lights than there should be on a tower. It was up two or three hundred feet. By the time it was due south of the driver's window, I could see five stable, white, evenly spaced, very bright lights in the shape of a triangle with several orange and blue lights that flashed randomnly. No two colored lights flashed at the same time. It remained for 10 to 15 seconds directly next to the driver's window so it must have been moving very slowly. We watched it continue to the northeast until we could no longer see it. Because we were on the interstate we were not able to stop or listen for sounds.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
Elongated triangular shaped craft seen over east Dayton, flying south before splitting into 2 seperate lights.;2010-06-01 00:45:00;5 minutes;Elongated triangular shaped craft seen over east Dayton, flying south before splitting into 2 seperate lights. So right around 12:45 tonight I was driving south on I-75 in downtown Dayton, OH just north of the I-35 changeover when I saw something in the sky over Dayton.  I was looking out my driverside window towards the city, which would have been directly east of the city.  It was an elongated triangular shaped object, seemingly delta shaped, which was either glowing or reflecting a bright yellowish white light.  At first glance I thought I was seeing moonlight through a break in distant clouds but quickly realized that the body of light was moving. It was traveling southbound with me and without immediately considering the details I just assumed it was a particularly visible conventional aircraft, but it's odd shape kept my attention.  With only my own perspective to judge from I couldn't accurately determine the objects distance from me and therefore couldn't figure its speed or altitude but after watching it for a couple minutes I realized that it was either much too large and traveling much too fast to be anything conventional or it was flying much too low over the city.  Within a few minutes I was taking the 35 East exit and at this point the shape was south east of the city. Around this point it split into two lights, one was directly above the other.  The bottom of the two lights seemed to have a slight red hue and the top was a pale white.  About two miles onto I-35 the lights were directly south of me and as I drove east the two gradually disappeared into the south.  By the time I reached Keowee St. they were no longer visible.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251

There was no sound coming from it.  The front of the craft had big bright white and red interchanging lights, and the bottom had three blue round blinking lights that were circular in shape (one on each corner of the triangle).  We tried to get photos, but the craft took off really fast.  We followed it until it disappeared.  About 40 minutes later, on the way home, we saw it again.  I stopped, and this time it hovered over us for about 30 seconds, and took off in the opposite direction.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251

There was a very low flying aircraft, probably around 600-700ft above the ground.  It was shaped like a boomerang with hard edges.  It was painted pitch black and had five lights.  Three white that were mounted on the far side of each aircraft, and one in the center that was blinking rapidly.  There was another two large orange lights mounted in the center of each wing.  It was moving very slowly, maybe 10MPH.  It was about 20 feet long and had a wingspan of about 50-60ft.  The object didn’t make any noise.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251

It was triangle shaped with a light in every corner of the craft.  It was about 250-300 feet up i’d say. it was making a humming noise and moving fairly slowly. I couldn’t tell what color it was but i’d say grey or black.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
