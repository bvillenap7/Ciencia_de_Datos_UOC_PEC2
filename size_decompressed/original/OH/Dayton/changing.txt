I Was a member of the ((deleted)) of the USAF at the time, on a TDY at Wright/Patt AFB. in Ohio. This was a daylight sighting. I was positioned overlooking the Airfield of W/P when I noticed a very Bright red (Dot)light in front of one of the hangers by the flight line. within a faction of a second (as if in a burst of energy)I saw coming towards my vantage point and position a circular disk shaped red opaque object climbing in altitude. As the object reached my 2:00 position, it seperated into two disks for a fraction of a second,(long enought time to discerne two distinct objects) and then came back together as one object. It continued traveling eastward towards my vantage point of which ended at about the 12:00 position. At that point my view point was obscured by a tall building. The next day I heard of a report in the local newspaper debunking the sighting as a weather balloon, so, obviously I was not the only spectator! There was no dicernable features other than it's scarlot red opaque disk shape. The sighting lasted about 10 sec. It was no weather balloon for it traveled at a high rate of speed!

Flashing Object, near Sirius Ohio;2018-02-02 00:00:00;10 minutes;Flashing Object, near Sirius Ohio Outdoors on my porch trying to get decent nighttime photos of the snowy yard.  Orion always has been easy to spot and when I looked up just to see if perhaps my camera (basic dslr) could get a pic of Orion, the consellation was located nearly due south of my location about 60 degrees above the horizon (may give a more accurate time than the one I listed since am not sure of the time I saw this).  The night was very clear and decided to try to photograph Orion. But before I did I noticed something different about Sirius (I believe Sirius Major, the bright star just to the side of Orion).  The bright star that flashes seemed to be doubled, with a second Sirius-type object just above it.  But the lights flashed on the upper object more quickly and in greater number (red, green, blue, white) than those of the star.   I aimed my camera at Sirius and this twin and began taking photos. As I did, the twin began to move away from Sirius, initially going higher so a definite gap between the two existed it then moved quickly out of my camera's previous focal area, darting west (to my right), pausing, then moving downward toward the horizon slightly (about 4 degrees), then more slowly moved east of Sirius while still lower in the sky, moved back to double the star again by aligning beneath it, only to move again. When it finally disappeared, it was from the original position in which I'd seen it. It didn't grow dim, it just vanished and Sirius was alone.  This actually happened twice, it showed again for about a minute, remaining stationary, before again vanishing.  I watched for another ten minutes but never saw it happen again. This object looked, to my eyes, very much like a slightly larger twin of Sirius, having a steady white light superimposed by lights which flashed at about the same pace at which those of Sirius seem to change.  The lights of the object were brighter than those of Sirius, and were red, green, blue, and white.  The white of the object itself may have been what I saw when the flashing light turned white, I'm not sure, but the other lights all coexisted with the overall white color. I had a clear view from about 15 degrees above the horizon to the southwest, south, and much of the southeast.  This object was at all times within about 4 degrees south or 2 degrees north of Sirius.  It moved quite a distance west and east of Sirius, however, mostly with movements so quick I could not see it move, though several times it was slow enough to follow it as it darted left or right once or twice it moves more slowly in this lateral direction. Its up and downward motions were quite gradual. I watched for about ten minutes, taking photos, also, which appeared very different from what I saw through the naked eye.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
Glittering cylindrical object over East Dayton.;2019-10-09 22:00:00;45 minutes;Glittering cylindrical object over East Dayton. I went out on our back patio at approx 10:00 pm on 10/9/19 to smoke.  As I was sitting there, I noticed a bright light in the NE sky.  I started watching it because of how bright it was and because the lights weren't horizontal in the sky but vertical. Over the course of the next 45 minutes, I watched this object which never deviated more than a couple of degrees from its position.  It seemed to be a cylindrical object with lights that made it look like it was glittering.  The lights would change from red to green to blue and, whenever I would see an obvious airplane in the sky near it, the lights would change to a bright white.  Once the aircraft was beyond a certain range, it would go back to the r/g/b rotation.  After approx 30 minutes, the shape of the craft changed to a tiny pinpoint of light which made me think that it had suddenly taken off but, to my surprise, after about 20 seconds it reappeared the same as it had been before.  This happened several times over the next 10 minutes.  I finally had to go inside so don't know how long this object was in the sky.  Did not take any photos as all I had was my cell phone and I knew with it being night and the distance to the object, it would pretty much be useless to try to capture what I was seeing.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
