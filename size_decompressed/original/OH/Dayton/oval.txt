Dayton, Ohio sighting;1971-06-30 22:00:00;30 seconds;Dayton, Ohio sighting The date of this sighting is approximate. It occurred late spring early summer when I was about 10 years old in Dayton, Ohio. We lived 2 houses West of Our Lady Of Mercy church. It was after dark and the family was watching TV in the dining room. I looked east out the side porch window and saw the craft. It was oval from what I could tell, with yellow light comming from what looked to be windows around the center of the craft. The craft was at 50'to 70' altitude judging from the tree height over which it was moving.The craft was at a distance of 150' to 200' from our house. I yelled for my family and they moved to the windows and saw the craft too. We then ran upstairs to get a better view of the craft. It moved slowly taking perhaps 20-30 seconds to move out of sight over the woods that bordered church property. While we were watching the craft a figure was seen inside who looked to be working controls of some sort. The figure was backlighted by the glow and I only was able to make out a dark human type shape. The following morning my brother and I went back in the woods where the craft had dissappered. About 200' inside the woods there was an area of crushed brush and even a couple broken saplings the largest being about 2&1/2 inches in diameter. This area was about 50' around, circular. And about 20'to 25' apart in the center there were 4 holes. These holes were about 3 wide and 6 to 8 deep. For several years following this sighting very little grew in the crushed area, and what plants that did grow there were sickly as was a tree that was on the edge of the area. No sound was ever heard from the craft, and though the outline was rather vague due to the darkness, There was no sign or visible means of propultion, and a absence of any engine sound.

Ufo seen near Wright Pat airforce base;1991-05-17 05:00:00;2 min;Ufo seen near Wright Pat airforce base I was about 10 years old when I seen this craft. I was woke up about 430 Am to come along with my mother so she could drop my father off at work. In the car was my sister my cousin whom was spending the night with us that night and I. We took I-75 back home as usual because my father worked 15 min away from where we lived. While on the highway after you pass I-70 But befor you get to benchwood rd exit (note Benchwood rd exit was not there 10 yrs ago)I notiched an circular oval shaped object hovering around the highway ligts. The ufo was very close to us and I could not beleive my eyes. It continued to circul the lights in rapid movements. The ufo flashed with lights that circled around the whole center of the craft. They were multi colored I remeber it was blue and red colored lights. As we passed the craft I looked back and continued to watch it untill I could no longer see it. I asked my cousin if we really just seen a ufo and she replied yes in a creeped out way. What i belive the ufo was doing was getting energy from the lights on the highway to help power its craft. That is what I beleive. I live 10 min from the wright pat airforce base and I came up with a theroy that maybe its a top secert craft they created that can spy. I have allways told everyone about this encounter but never thought about reporting it till watching shows on ufos. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

unexplained departure from atmosphere;1994-06-01 12:00:00;total =15 sec;unexplained departure from atmosphere ((name and e-address deleted))  Im 37, never seen anything odd or could not explain in my life.  I have perfect vision, on no medication, etc..   It’s 1997 now, but in 1994, an incident occurred. This has been occurring to me lately, I saw a, lets say, UFO.  Im from Dayton, OH, but I was in Fairborn, OH, this particular day It was around 12:00 noon, full daylight, little clouds in the sky..  I walked out outside of a apartment complex, mind you id been up since about 9:00 am, as soon as I get outside, I noticed a round, rather large object sitting in the high air, hovering.  A friend was with me but I was so attached to the object in the sky, I wasn’t able to say anything to him till it was all over.  I continued walking and starring, after about 8-10 seconds the object ascended, or rather departed farther into the sky.  Estimating another 5-7 seconds to depart.  Now this is the reason why I believed what I saw.  Not only a full beautiful day of sunlight, hardly a cloud in the sky, but... As the object departed, whatever part of the sky this is actually visible, (I’m not sure if our own space shuttle does this, I could be wrong, but I don’t think so) I noticed I could see a distortion around the object.  Simply I could see black around the departing object, rather the distortion allowed me to see, without the blue sky, right into space, or rather the point of leaving the atmosphere allowed the, or didn’t allow light as normal.  I cant really explain, but my brain, or rather I would have never have thought of that occurring. The process that took place I’ve never considered.  I believe what I saw only because of the sunny day, perfect vision, not really, the distortion around the object as it departed, like I say, I could not have conceived the Idea of what I saw.  I, in general do not think of this memory, vary rarely, but an idea popped into my head to write and send to , somewhere.  I don’t expect belief, anyone can say anything, I would like an explanation of a similar distortion that occurs as an object departs, or it only happens under certain conditions, as I explained.  Its thursaday, Jan 25, If explanation, please reply.. ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251

At first I thought it was just a shooting star but then the light shot straight back up into the sky and disappeared.  I do believe it was a UFO.
