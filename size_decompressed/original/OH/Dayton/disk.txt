Large silver disk rolls alongf tree tops near Wright-Patterson AFB;1969-08-01 17:30:00;1 minute;Large silver disk rolls alongf tree tops near Wright-Patterson AFB My crew chief, ((name deleted)) and I were traveling west of Dayton Ohio on I-70 about 5:30 in the afternoon. ((name deleted)) was driving, suddenly I noticed to my right over the tree tops was a large silver disk that seemed to be rolling along the tree tops going a couple of hundred miles an hour and completely silent. I called it to Tom's attention and then suddenly the craft made a 90 degree turn and headed into space and was completely gone in about 5 seconds! Tom and I thought that we had witnessed a new secret Air Force fighter and scanned the newspapers for a couple of days for the story. We were near the infamous Wright-Patterson AFB and thought that the Aircraft had come from the base. ((name deleted)) and I were quite impressed with the Aircraft's performance! Thirty years later no such craft has been disclosed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of several reports submitted by same source.  PD));39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
