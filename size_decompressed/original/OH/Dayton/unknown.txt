small light in the sky, not blinking, below high clouds, and traveling VERY fast...;2000-05-22 23:15:00;5-10 sec.;small light in the sky, not blinking, below high clouds, and traveling VERY fast... On Sunday, I was headed home from work at about 11:15 pm, when I saw a small white light in the sky, At first I thought it was an airplain, then I noticed that it had no blinking lights. Then I thought that it could have been a sattelite, but it was a cloudy night. I could see no stars. The object was headed East, North East, at a very fast rate. I detected it when it was directly North of me, and followed it untill it disapeared over the trees. it took about 5-10 seconds to disapper. It must have been going about 4 times as fast as any aircraft I have ever seen. We have the Wright Patterson Air Force Base here in Dayton, so I have seen some pretty quick aircraft, but this thing was faster then ANYTHING I have ever seen in the sky before. Just wanted to let you know what I saw. - You can contact me at ((contact information deleted)) Thank you, ((name deleted));39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
Bright Yellow Light Over Southern Downtown Dayton;2006-03-08 00:50:00;3-10 min;Bright Yellow Light Over Southern Downtown Dayton On March 8, 2006, at 12:50 and 01:00 I seen a bright yellow object above the horizon. The location was in Downtown Dayton, Ohio. The exact location was between the hospital then going a clockwise direction towards me. There was a plane close by it. As the UFO got closer the yellow light was so bright I could not get a close up of the ufo. I've lived in downtown dayton for nearly 2 years now and I know the difference between a airplane a possible ufo. The hospital did not have any helicopters in the area that I know of. I'm a college student studying aviation and I know the flimar lights on a aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found him to be quite sincere.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD));39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
