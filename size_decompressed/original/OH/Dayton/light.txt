Brilliant light turning red then disappears;2001-09-10 22:00:00;10 minutes;Brilliant light turning red then disappears My daughter, her boyfriend,and myself were sitting on my covered back patio at 10 p.m. on September 10,2001. They were sitting there smoking and comversing mostly between themselves. I was just sitting there to show my presence to show her boyfriend that I still liked his company even though their relationship of two years had recently broken up and had left everyone concerned,not knowing exactly how to address each other now! I just happened to be looking to the eastern sky when I saw a brilliant bright light in traditional flight lane over Fairborn, Ohio. I ws looking at it over some power lines that run over my back yard. The light moves up slightly over the power line and seemed to hover there, in relation to the power line and my direction of vision. Within about two minutes I saw a light approach this brilliant light from the southern sky. It was headed at a normal aircraft pace to the place that the bright light was hovering. The light from the south sky approached the position where the brilliant light was and it moved straight up as if the jet(I'm thinking) passed it by. Then a jet with lights blinkiing like an emergency vehicle and headed towards the bright light flew from what I surmise as around Wright Patterson field, which is close to where I live,at a bat outa hell pace and sped off toward the position of the light that is still in my vision over the power line in my back yard. When this jet approached this area something very strange happened. The brilliant light turned red and seemed to change into  not one but two  pulsating red lights and and just blinked out. The jet seemed to fly right past where it was....and we never seem the brilliant light nor the pulsating lights again. As we talked about what we had seen, I told my daughter that she probably had just leen her first ufo. Her ex-boyfriend didn't know what to think of it either.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
A bright white light over Dayton that danced around the sky at incredible speeds;2009-10-19 01:30:00;10 minutes;A bright white light over Dayton that danced around the sky at incredible speeds My fiance and I were sitting in our bed, when he looked out our window and spotted bright light in the distance that seemed to be moving strangely.  We stared trying to decide if maybe it was a star or satelite.  It started to move up very fast and side to side at fast speeds. At this point, we knew it was neither.  It was a bright white light with a faint blue light. We stared at it for 10 minutes in disbelief watching it move around irradically.  It eventually dropped down out of our sight.  We are not sleeping well tonight!;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
Red spherical light flew overhead in Dayton, Ohio.;2011-09-25 01:10:00;3-4 minutes;Red spherical light flew overhead in Dayton, Ohio. As if rising vertically from the ground behind a eastern facing building I observed 1 red spherical light.  It rose to what looked like very low aircraft altitude very slowly.  I ran inside to grab a camera while my husband waited outside.  When I came out it was obvious it had increased in speed and started moving towards us in a diagonal pattern.  I was able to snap one picture but soon my vision was obstructed by a tree.  Once it flew past the tree the light went off and it appeared clear.  It moved on west  into the distance. After reviewing the photo no object was seen.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
Two pilots spot three UFOs south of downtown Dayton, Ohio.;2011-12-03 19:00:00;5 minutes;Two pilots spot three UFOs south of downtown Dayton, Ohio. My friend and I decided to take a flight to Indiana for dinner, and were departing from Dayton Wright Brothers Airport around 1900 EST.  There were three people in the airplane. Two of us were pilots with around 100 hours, and one other person who was not a pilot.  As we took off and turned towards the proper heading we notice three bright lights off the left wing south of the airport.  At first glance we thought it was a large jet then we noticed there were not any position lights, beacon, etc., and the craft was entirely too low to be a craft of that size. As we paid more attention we noticed there appeared to be three different craft in a tight formation.   This gave us the last clue that these craft were probably not anything weâ€™ve ever seen before.  Flying in a tight formation at night is dangerous, and keeping it that consistent would be nearly impossible. We were climbing out of three thousand feet and I would estimate the three UFOs were at one thousand feet above the ground.    As we looked down on the three craft they seemed to cycle positions in the formation, cut hard to the left, and took off over the city.  All the people in the plane lost sight of the craft at this point.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
Multiple high speed, high altitude lights over Dayton, Ohio.;2012-10-04 20:30:00;1 hour;Multiple high speed, high altitude lights over Dayton, Ohio. At about 20:30 EST, my sister called me to see if I had seen any lights outside.  She and my parents had been standing outside since 20:00 watching dozens of lights moving from south to north over Dayton, Ohio.  I went outside and immediately spotted on of the lights. I went inside and grabbed my wife, who also saw.  She proceeded to call her parents and brother, who also all saw the lights. The lights were extremely high in altitude, very fast, and ranged in colors of white, blue, and red. Several of them flickered.  I think the color difference could be explained by differences in altitude. After roughly 15 minutes of watching, I saw three all moving at the same speed in a staggered triangle formation.  Already in amazement by what I was seeing, a much larger, deep red light followed those three. At first, I was waiting to see if they would fade from view at about 30 degrees as most satellites I have seen do.  The only time the lights faded was when they were so distant I could no longer see them, but never did they flicker out like satellites.  Living near Wright-Patterson, I am not entirely surprised to see things like this, but they were definitely not aircraft that the public knows about.  None of the lights changed direction, seemingly all having a set destination or orbit. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

UFO near Air Force Base.;2014-03-31 21:05:00;3-5 minutes;UFO near Air Force Base. On Monday march 31, 2014 in Dayton, Ohio, my wife and I were cooking out in our back yard on a very clear night.  We were both sitting at our table in the back yard when all the sudden a very bright orange light moving very fast with what looked like bluish streaking light coming out of the back of it appeared in plain sight and stopped suddenly. The craft was very close to the ground, I'd say about 500 feet and maybe 5 miles from us.  At first I thought it was a meteor or large shooting star but when it hovered for about three to five minuets I knew I was looking at something out of the ordinary.  We live very close to Wright Patterson Air Force Base so I thought maybe they were doing something like they do, secret, ya know?  But as my wife and I watched it fly away rather slow, I noticed there was no Air traffic in the sky at all.  We took a video of this and watched it twice but, then the video just corrupted itself.   We then noticed Jets taking off from the Air Force Base (two that we seen) as the craft dissipated into the distance going from South West to North.  The Jets we witnessed turned their lights off at what seemed to me to be about 500-1000ft First Jet turned off its lights, then jet #2 did the same. I called 911 to make a report but they did not take me seriously.  I've never believed  in Flying Saucers of believed in UFO sightings but, what my wife and I seen on March 31, 2014, was real.  It was not a fleeting glimpse of something strange.   We seen something very much unexplainable and I think what ever it was, it spooked the Air Force Base by our house!;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251

Blue/green light 1:49AM Dayton, OH circular;2016-04-04 01:49:00;0.5 second;blue/green light 1:49AM Dayton, OH circular I am driving home from Columbus on 70-E headed towards 75-N and over the tree line to my right see a light reflect off the clouds. At first it looks like heat lightning, but instead of seeing a stark white bolt of lightning what proceeds from the clouds in a sharp blue/green light. It is radial up towards the sky. It is so specifically green and blue it takes my breath away. This is towards Fairborn/Huber Heights possibly the Wright Patterson Airforce Base? I try to send a text message to my friend and she receives EVERY text including my call but does NOT receive the text that is explicit in detail of the time and description of the light. REPEAT:  I sent a descriptive text of the time/shape/color of the light and she did not receive it both times but received every other text! I have never even heard of this site. I just googled blue green light in Dayton to see if anyone had seen anything or reported on it in the news and this site came up. I am terrified to see a similar entry back in August of 2015 in the exact same area at the same time. Will I be visited tonight? Very scared. I'm even afraid to leave my contact info because i don't trust this site. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Lasted at least 2 hours Strange flashing lights in the clouds similar to lightning but there was no rain or thunder.  There were 5 flashes and they happened in the same spots, except they very slowly moved along. Like so slow it was hard to notice.  We could not see the source of the lights.  There were at least 6 planes observing the phenomenon flying around it.  We know it lasted for at least two hours, but it was getting late so we went to sleep.

Bright light shifts, dims, suddenly accelerates and disappears.;2021-06-29 23:35:00;3min;Bright light shifts, dims, suddenly accelerates and disappears. At 11:35pm a friend and I were out having a cigarette on my porch as he was leaving after hanging out for a bit after work. Ironically we were talking about the recent UAP report and I jokingly said I'd been watching the sky suspiciously since then. He responds Well at least that light is obviously terrestrial in origin.  Sure enough there was a bright light in the sky, which got brighter as we were looking at it. He remarked that it must be a helicopter with a search light on. Which admittedly was what I was thinking. Then the light shifted, and was no longer pointed directly at us, which made me realize it was bright enough to be illuminating us a bit, a few lumens at best. He started trying to guess what it was. Guesses included a jet throwing on it's after burners, which we discarded because it wasn't moving fast, and didn't make a sound.  The object appeared to be a ball of light, to me. At this point one side was dimmer than the other which was still extremely bright. Movement was... drifting, moved down a bit, and began heading almost exactly due north. After the incident I confirmed on the Star Map app it had passed almost 1 inch above the M33 star for a reference in the night sky. Then it dimmed to where it was almost non-visible in the light pollution of the city lights (due North of my location is downtown, the sky is much less visible). When it dimmed it rapidly accelerated until it was non visible (less than a second). Up until this acceleration I'd describe it's movement as 'drifting' and it only moved around 5-6in while it was bright.  After it disappeared I thought to check the time and the star it passed nearest to while bright. Hope it helps.  Star was M33, and the location was the address provided. Can't really estimate what distance it was to us. Looked high altitude, but originally when the light was bright we thought it was a lot closer .;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
