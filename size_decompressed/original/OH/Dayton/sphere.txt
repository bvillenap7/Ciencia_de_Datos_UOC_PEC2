LARGE ROUND OBJECT, CLOSE TO THE GROUND, HOVERS IN MID AIR FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, THEN DIVES OFF BEHIND THE TREES IN DAYTON, OHIO;1999-06-01 22:00:00;5 minutes;LARGE ROUND OBJECT, CLOSE TO THE GROUND, HOVERS IN MID AIR FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, THEN DIVES OFF BEHIND THE TREES IN DAYTON, OHIO I was looking out my patio in the evening , and saw a round shape brightly lit all the way around it. It got closer to where I could see it very well, and well enough to know it was not a plane, and it was not a helicopter, and it was not a balloon of any kind. I was alone, and on the phone with my mother when I saw it. I  looked at it for several minutes explaining to my mother what it looked like, and how it was just hovering in mid air not moving, when I saw my boyfriend driving down our driveway.  I hung up on my mother, while I sprinted down the second floor steps to the parking lot of our apartment building.  By the time I got to the parking lot to scream out to him to look up, it dove off to the north/east behind the trees very quickly, and it was gone, ALMOST AS IF IT KNEW I WAS TRYING TO GET SOMEONE ELSE TO LOOK AT IT.  The lights were all the way around the craft, and seemed to move around or light up at different intervals. It was very close to the ground, closer than any commercial airliner would be. I am guessing it was around 10 pm and it wasn't cold out, so possibly summer or spring time, but I didnt log it down, so the details arent as clear as they were. I didnt want to tell anyone for fear they'd think I was crazy, but I am more curious now than anything to see if anyone else saw what I saw. I never heard anything on the news about it, but I am positive about what I saw, and the thought of it makes me feel very unsecure! The exact location was on Revere St. in Dayton, Ohio 45420 between Patterson and Watervliet. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
Yellowish/orange spheres seen by 4 people in Dayton, Ohio.;2012-07-28 21:40:00;15 minutes;Yellowish/orange spheres seen by 4 people in Dayton, Ohio. On the evening of 28 July 2012 at approximately 2140 eastern time, observed 14 sphere/ball shaped UFOâ€™s traveling west to east in the southern sky of Dayton/Kettering, Ohio.  They were traveling across the sky, one after the other.   They all seemed to travel the same flight path but were somewhat sporadic in timing and distance.  A couple of times two would be in real close proximity to each other, one a little bit higher than the other.  Each sphere looked like a combination of white, red and yellow, which in turn gave them an overall look of an orange glow as they moved across the sky.  A couple of them were a little more red in color.  Two of the spheres seemed to drop something that looked like a burning ember off the bottom of them which slowly disappeared as they were falling.  Eventually all the spheres would turn more to the south and disappear once they reached the western area of the sighting.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
Sphere shaped object with colors moving at a abnormal rate of speed.;2013-05-26 21:00:00;90 seconds;Sphere shaped object with colors moving at a abnormal rate of speed. My friend was driving, I was in the passenger seat driving on I-75 heading south from Dayton to Cincinnati.  It was dark outside and we had been driving on I-75 from Dayton for about 10-15 minutes when my friend driving looked up and said what the hell is that!   I immediately looked up and saw a sphere shaped object that seemed to be changing color or rotating with differently red and blue colors on the object right above us.  The object appeared small at first but then got slightly larger (seemingly lowering its altitude).   I followed the object as it moved past the freeway heading Northward off I-75.  I followed it off the freeway and the object appeared to have a faint white light behind it.  It was fairly close to us still as it moved away and then, within 20 seconds went very fast away going very high upward until it was no longer visible.   While it was over the freeway, it seemed to be hovering or staying in place for a second.  As it went away it moved at a very very high rate of speed and climbed vertically.

There were 8 witnesses on our farm. Very high up in altitude there were 2 sphere like ufos slowly flying opposite of each other. Around 4 minute duration for both aircraft.

Strange object with bright lights flying and hovering over Harrison Twp in Dayton.;2014-08-31 21:50:00;15 minutes;Strange object with bright lights flying and hovering over Harrison Twp in Dayton Saw an orbital sphere traveling at a fast rate of speed going northwest and slowed to a hover below the clouds.  It was illuminated with red, green and blue flashing lights.  It moved quickly and hovered, appeared to be lowering and then moved to the east and disappeared past our view in tree line.   The object didn't appear to make any sounds.   We did take a short video of part of the even, but the video only caught the last minutes of the event, as we didn't have a cell phone nearby and watched from backyard Jacuzzi before we got out and went inside to grab a phone and go out front to video.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
