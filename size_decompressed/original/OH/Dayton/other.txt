I heard the coast to coast airing this Friday.  Heard the plea about the past sightings.  Every time I gaurdedly tried to tell someone, really ridiculed.  I was mgr of restaurant owned by retired air force brass.  Something was very wrong with him.  (I know his exact name)  He was brilliant, but troubled.  Over time we bonded.  He was trying to tell me why he had problems. I am a devout christian.  Eventually after months, in three sessions he revealed his troubling secret.  I can give very detailed report, never forgotten this!!!  He purported that he was for a wing? of SAC, the flight surgeon.  He had been called to hurridly called to the base in the night.  With little warning he was sworn to highest secrecy.  He was one of five doctors examining two bodies.  Aliens.  To do autopsies.  He was not in charge but present.  He gave me details.  He was a shattered man.  It shook his catholic beliefs to the core.  He could not understand why.  Why he was chosen.  Why he was so threatened.  Why this had happened.  Why nothing had ever come out. Everything he believed in was shattered forever.  I have never seen a man so shaken inside.  On our third meeting he broke down horribly.

Summer of '99 Nostrodamus prophecy sighting near WPAFB;1999-07-28 21:30:00;2 hours +;Summer of '99 Nostrodamus prophecy sighting near WPAFB To all concerned citizens, if you could help me with this problem it would be greatly appreciated.  I had just came home from work, fixed a meal and ate, when I decided to sit outside and enjoy the night air in my backyard. I was out there for about 30-45 minutes after sunset when the clouds started coming in, the weather called for rain, so as I was watching some of the forcasted clouds come in, I peered up and to my amazement I caught what I beleived to be a ship hiding in concealment. So, I was transfixed on it as it passed slowly by there was no sound coming from this ship at all. Then it occured to me that Nostrodamuses claim was wrong it wasn't meteors he saw but alien spacecraft.To my greatest suprise I would get to see two of the worlds greatest theories come to pass. As I watched as it passed overhead, another came by then another, then another, as I was calculating where they were going. I figured it was WPAFB. Then they stopped. The ship overhead was a triangle in shape with three large viewing windows from my observation,ther was also two figures in the windows which seemed to be looking directly towards me, so I just politely waved greeting them to Dayton. Then all of a sudden out of the corner of my eye I saw a bluish type of light, like that on Star Trek's transporter system. Well to my suprise it seemed like there were little children running around my yard playing. I couldn't see them physically because they had on something that made them seem to be invisible. Like that suit the predator wore when he was fighting Arnold S. then as i am looking around I feel a little one lean on my leg and seem to be looking right into my face, and another start playing in my hair, like they have never seen a black guy before. It was just amazing that there kids was just as curious as mine are. So I peer back up and smile & laugh that the two are still there in the window are still looking down on us. It must have been at least 20 or more minutes they stayed in my yard playing. The ships started moving out, I would guess that WPAFB had difficulty greeting our new friends and unloading there belongings. I would guess this ship that stopped over my head was a passenger vehicle, because there was more vehicles to come. The next was box shaped,like a transporter. The one after that had my magneto pulse drive system underneath. I counted at least ten ships, but the last two gave me goose bumps you could tell these were not peace loving ships these were built for fighting. they were larger than the rest with deep grooves and edges, and just looked terrorfying. WPAFB was busy that night,lol. I thank the lord for letting me be a part of this. But I would like to see the proof that I am not Haluccinating. If you could get the weather pictures it might be able to prove it. Nostradamus, and I werent seeing things, please help us prove this. Sigthing July 27th,1999 time around 9:30pm-11:45 or so coming from the west, heading towards WPAFB. Let the truth be told. thank-you very much for listening to my sighting of some ufo's.

WPAFB Dayton OH, 3 cloud ufos, we were seen, followed by white vans who later  asked me about ufo's.;2000-06-15 05:00:00;15-20 min.;WPAFB Dayton OH, 3 cloud ufos, we were seen, followed by white vans who later  asked me about ufo's. We stood on an access road by a large grass field and treeline at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton,OH. About 5a.m., we observed three white vapor clouds rising from the earth, as if evaporating. From a distance they would have been inconspicuous, but clouds do not take independent trajectories regardless of wind direction, not to mention the clearly visible rotating bands of white lights in each cloud. A very  low-flying plane passed directly overhead, with a very odd  paint scheme, and a very odd metal framework of objects affixed to the underneath, so much that there clearly was no way landing gear could function, had there been any. Directly afterwards, three vehicles drove by us, one a white van w/ two men that followed us to our job, came in one hour before we opened, then a man phoned to offer us a cab ride out of there We were followed everywhere by white vans for weeks, then two vans came to my house to work on the utility pole in my yard. No utility companies I called knew anything about it, and when I went out to speak to them, they asked me about ufo's.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
The Department of Positive Out of Body Possibilities;2009-01-22 20:00:00;Current;The Department of Positive Out of Body Possibilities This is not a normal sighting, as you are use to hearing about. It goes far deeper than that. It's more like a vision, from internal thought. My inner thoughts have figured out a way. How we can communication with afterlife people, in a way that can be measured for free!  I would like to be contacted by an investigator, and given the chance to explain my description better.

I was in the passengerâ€™s seat and my husband was driving.   I happened to look out my window to the right and in the distance, coming towards the earth diagonally I saw what I thought to be a large, slow moving meteor coming towards the earth.  It was orange-yellowish in color and had a long tail.   As it was approaching, it split off into 3 different balls of light that seemed to be about the sizes of very large stars and they continued to have the same color.   They hovered in different parts of the sky and hovered up then down (not simultaneously) and then finally just down until we could no longer see them because of the obstruction of view and the fact that we were driving in the opposite direction. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be a quite serious-minded individual.  PD));39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251

Lights on some sort of craft seen in the western sky from behind Submarine House;2016-09-07 21:30:00;30 seconds;Lights on some sort of craft seen in the western sky from behind Submarine House I was on a smoke break behind Submarine House on Brown St. when up over the western horizon at a pretty high altitude, I saw three lights, positioned right next to one another, I could easily see something connecting all three, and the largest light was positioned in the middle. They were moving in an eastward direction. I watched them for about 30 seconds, assumed it was a plane that was too far for me to see the blinking lights on the wings and/or tail, and looked down at my phone to respond to a text. When I looked back up, the lights were gone. It was a very clear evening so they could not have gone behind a cloud, and the speed at which these lights were moving would've made it impossible for the lights to pass over my head in the few seconds I was looking at my phone.;39.7269357059506;-84.1770537456251
