Approxinately 2:00 a.m. I went onto our back porch to smoke a cigarette before going to bed. As I sat, I looked out toward the northeast(over the town of London) and saw a rectangular bright red light. It was probably somewhere around two miles in the distance, low in the horizon, but above the treetops. It was a very brilliant light and was not moving. I am not sure of it's size, but it was quite large. I kept looking, trying to figure out what it was. I looked from every angle I could from the porch. Suddenly, the oject moved at a VERY high rate of speed away from me. It moved so fast that it became a small dot, then disappeared in the distance. The rate of travel had to be EXTREME, because it was gone in less than two seconds. It's the strangest thing I have ever seen. I did not report it.;39.9069;-83.4445999999999
