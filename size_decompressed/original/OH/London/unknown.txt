Cluster of lights;2011-02-10 20:30:00;15-20 mins;Driving on S.R. 42 from London to S.Charleston, OH, a dim shape more like a cluster of lights at high altitude and motionless sat fixed in the N.W. direction.  There were no other distinguishable lights, stars, craft in that direction.   In this area occasionally a Hercules Transport U.S.A.F. craft will be seen lumbering along headed to Wright-Pat, but this object did not move or change position for an extended period.  It was unusual in configuration and the dots of light seemed to be grouped together in some kind of configuration which made me think it was a single craft.   After several minutes of driing with no other vehicles on the road it just seemed to fade out and it was gone.   Visibility was fair with some high overcast.  Writing this to see if anyone else observed this object???;39.9069;-83.4445999999999

I thought it was a helicopter, so I stop my truck and got out.  No sound at all.  The object remained on the sky's for at least 2 minutes.  After that, the lights started going deem and varnished.   Got back on my truck drove about 120 miles to Mansfield, OH.  I switched the load, head back.  I got on the same place on the opposite side on I70 WB.  Saw truck and trailer caught on fire.  I thought it was random but two days in a row.  Same place, same mile marker.  Two tractor and trailers caught on fire on separate days.;39.9069;-83.4445999999999
