multiple light display over central london;2004-11-15 02:30:00;20 mins;multiple light display over central london Looked out of bathroom window at 0230hrs saw flashes of light in sky over central london. Thought northern lights or ground source laser display at first.  Appearance of a cloud of swirling lights predominantly white but occasionally changing to blue or red.  Lights not moving completely in synchronisation but co-ordinated making shapes. Moving around the sky at speeds in excess of anything previously seen.  Got the wife out of bed to witness the display which lasted for twenty minutes.  Remarkable.  Any explanation or accounts of similar sightings would be appreciated.;39.9069;-83.4445999999999
