Eratic white and red light flying near the horizon;2016-07-03 04:00:00;>10 minutes;Eratic white and red light flying near the horizon I was star gazing when I saw a strange moving light in the lower part of the horizon South-Southeast towards Randolph-Atwater.  At first I thought it was a plane but it was moving randomly in the same region of the sky.  It alternated between white, red, and maybe blueish lights.  I next thought it was a law enforcement helicopter doing IR sweeps but the movements were too eratic and always in the same area of the sky.  From my perspective it moved easily an 1-1.5 in any direction at any given time.;41.1024;-81.2064
