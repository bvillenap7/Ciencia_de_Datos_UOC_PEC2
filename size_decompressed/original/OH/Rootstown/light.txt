Ohio;2010-07-04 10:00:00;10 min;Orange/Red Pulsating Orb appeared to be viewing neighborhood fireworks display in Porage Co. Ohio I was outside as I am every night stargazing and enjoying the summer here in NE Ohio, and happen to catch a far off neighbors firework display off in the distance (Due South).  During the show (they were small fireworks) a orange orb of sorts was hovering right above the treetops off in the distance as if it was watching the display.  It was still, pulsated orange/red (I thought it was a cellular tower at first but then I realized that HEY we are out in the country, there are only trees out that way)   It moved slowly westard, sat another few moments, moved eastward, sat a few moments, faded out, reappeared slowly 2-3 minutes later, sat about 2-3 minutes, and slowing faded out of sight.  I would be shocked if the party people did not notice it, but you never know, the wiskey runs a little freely around the 4th).   I have seen this particular orb/UFO three other times over the past 2 months with the same mannerisms.  My honest opinion about this particular episode was that it was indeed watching the fireworks display.  You can almost tell it was intrigued by the display as if a small child was peeking around his fathers legs to check out a large dog.  It is so exciting to see our alien friends coming out of the woodwork, every night is a new adventure when darkness falls on NE Ohio!;41.1024;-81.2064
