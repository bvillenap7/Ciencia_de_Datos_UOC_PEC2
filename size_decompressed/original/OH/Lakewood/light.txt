Motionless silent flashing colored lights;2009-06-23 22:15:00;1 minute;Motionless silent flashing colored lights I was riding my bicycle to a friend’s house, and was a little lost.  After turning around to backtrack, I noticed two colored flashing lights in the sky horizontally placed next to each other.  It looked like a plane, except they didn’t seem to be moving, or making noise like a helicopter.  As I coasted slowly up the street, I had my gaze fixed on the object, and for almost a minute it did not appear to move.  Then a streetlight obstructed my vision for no more than a second, and the object was gone. The sky was totally clear, and there were no buildings obstructing the general area where I saw it.  I stopped my bike and stared at the sky for several minutes trying to figure out where it had gone, but I couldn't find it anywhere in the sky.  I would like to add that I am skeptical about this kind of thing, and I am not certain that I saw something paranormal, that my eyes didn't play a trick on me, but it is somewhat confusing to me.  The main reason I came to this site was to see if anyone else had seen something unusual that night.;41.4866000000001;-81.8037000000002
Twinkling amber star like UFO shot straight up into the night sky from tree tops in disappeared over Lakewood/Rocky River OH;2015-08-15 22:42:00;30 seconds;Twinkling amber star like UFO shot straight up into the night sky from tree tops in disappeared over Lakewood/Rocky River OH Ooomfg!!! We were sitting on the front porch at 10:42 PM, Saturday night, 8/15/15, and watched this amber twinkling star like light move straight up from the tree tops (north western sky) up to the stars very quickly!  Wow.  It went straight up into the night sky into the stars and vanished.   It seemed to start off slow then pick up speed as it kept going up to space.  Twinkling like an amber star it appeared to have come up from trees in the distance as if it had landed somewhere in the north western part of Lakewood/Rocky River, Ohio, area.   Then, it just went straight up, which is unnatural to any plane or helicopter movements.  Did not have lights but twinkled like a star.;41.4866000000001;-81.8037000000002
