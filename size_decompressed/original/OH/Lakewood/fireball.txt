Orange light flies overhead and turns black as it passed silently.;2011-10-10 21:00:00;1 minute;Orange light flies overhead and turns black as it passed silently. At about 21:00 I witnessed an orange glowing light coming in from the southeast.  It was bright orange but once overhead the color was gone.  As it headed over me and went in a straight line to the northwest it became black.  It made no noise, and did not appear to be decending. I would not have been able to see the object if I had not saw it coming in.  It was not visible at all before it made it to the horizon.;41.4866000000001;-81.8037000000002
