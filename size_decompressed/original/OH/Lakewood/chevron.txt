Gossamer V-shaped object seen from Ohio;2002-11-27 23:30:00;20 seconds;Gossamer V-shaped object seen from Ohio Around 11:30pm last night (the 27th, EST) I stepped outside to have a look at the night sky. I first caught sight of the planet Jupiter, rather bright and imposing, shining away in the eastern sky. Several winter constellations were also visible overhead and in the south, shining through a thin layer of haze and broken clouds. It was a rather chilly evening so I decided to leave my telescope indoors and just do some 'eyeball astronomy'. After a couple minutes I suddenly noticed an object midway up in the east (about 50 degrees altitude) moving south. Its appearance was that of broadly V-shaped gossamer contrail, three full moon diameters wide, without any lights or form of illumination. I expected the object to begin to disperse and dissipate as I watched, due to its thin and wispy appearance. It did not! The object continued to move south steadily. I lost sight of it after twenty seconds or so when the object moved behind a bank of clouds in the south. It made no sound the entire time that I had it in view. Being an amateur astronomer for the past twenty years has given me the opportunity to experience a good amount of sky phenomena. I have never seen anything in the night sky that I didn't have an explanation for - until now! I would be very interested in any and all plausible explanations of the object I spotted. My only explanation - birds flying south for the winter - was quickly discarded when I witnessed the object move behind the clouds.;41.4866000000001;-81.8037000000002
