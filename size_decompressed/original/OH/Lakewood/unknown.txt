Red pulsing stationary light.  ((anonymous report));2017-12-08 06:40:00;Unsure;Red pulsing stationary light There is no spectacular story here, it's just that I cannot explain this red, pulsing light that I saw on my drive to work this morning. I pulled up to the stoplight to turn onto the highway on ramp, and noticed this red ball of light in the sky.  It was high enough that it wasn't coming from a house or a building in the area. It had to be something  in the sky.  There are no poles nearby that could emit the light.  There were no other colors. It was just one red ball of light, that just stayed in one spot. It was not an airplane because it did not travel.  It was not a helicopter.  It only had one red light, so it was not a pole that warns aircraft of low power lines and it wasn't a cell phone tower.  I am familiar with this area in the day light which is why I cannot figure out what it was. As I turned on to the highway the light continued to pulse, in that same spot.  I kept looking back over my shoulder to make sure I didn't see other colored lights or additional lights or movement- but I didn't.
