A BRIGHT LIGHT WAS MOVING JUST ABOVE THE CLOUDS VERY SLOWLY FROM NORTH TO SOUTH.;2002-11-15 22:00:00;3 MIN;A BRIGHT LIGHT WAS MOVING JUST ABOVE THE CLOUDS VERY SLOWLY FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. I WAS WALKING MY DOG, JUST A NORMAL SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD, THE SKY WAS OVERCAST. I LOOKED UP TO SEE WHAT THE SKY CONDITIONS WHERE BECAUSE RAIN WAS FORCAST WHEN I SAW A PERFECT CIRCLE OF WHITE LIGHT JUST ABOVE THE CLOUDS, IT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 40 FEET IN DIAMETER MOVING DIRECTLY SOUTH AT A SLOW RATE OF SPEED. SOMETHING WAS JUST ABOVE THE CLOUD DECK, THE LIGHT WAS VERY EVEN AND BRIGHT, YOU COULD SEE THE SHAPES OF THE CLOUDS BELOW IT BUT THERE WAS NO BREAK IN THEM AND THERE WAS NO SOUND AT ALL. THE OBJECT MOVED AT A CONSTANT SPEED AND IN ABOUT 3 MINUTES WAS OVER THE HORIZON. IF YOU LOOK DIRECTLY NORTH FROM WHERE THE CIRCLE CAME FROM YOU WILL BE ON AVON POINT IN LAKE ERIE.
