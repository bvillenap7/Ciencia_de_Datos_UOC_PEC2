I was on my deck overlooking Lake Erie and a craft that was totally silent approached grom the east  at a low altitude.  It was moving  like a hang glider or parachutist would move except it was moving  directly sideways.  As it approached it looked redder and redder and appeared to be on fire.  It wentbpast me slightly then stopped and hovered.  I was afraid to run for my camera but bolted to get it.  When I returned it was in the same location but going straight up quickly. I got 2 shots, it moved faster and almost disappeared going straight up.   I ran for my husband in the front yard  who was talking to a neighbor and we all saw it continue to go straight up.  It hovered higher up and started to send out large red beams in different directions for a few minutes and then it disappeared still going straight up.  My neighbor and I saw  a new object or the same one appear in a different location right over our heads and then it moved north and then straight up like the previous object.  It too sent out some red beams and then while ascending in a straight line up disappeared.;41.4802;-82.0997
