Flying object shaped like a pagoda flew over  neighborhood trees and homes.;1990-06-17 20:30:00;15 minutes;Flying object shaped like a pagoda flew over  neighborhood trees and homes. The sky was hazy and white to light gray. Temperature was about 75 degrees Fahrenheit. It was a pleasant day. I was cutting small branches off of my pine trees which sit on either side of my sloping driveway. As I looked up and to my left I saw a large object flying over the street. The object was banking hard to the right. Very strongly and quite loudly I shouted:What the hell is that, what the hell is that, what the hell is that? I dropped my shears and ran diagonally across the street to the space between the houses. The object was still banking very hard to its right and flew across the street to my left and over a house to my left. It was at an altitude of about 60 feet and moving slowly right above the tree tops. I arrived between the two houses across the street just as the object was directly behind the houses and flying parallel to the houses. At this point the object was almost overhead. The object was light brown with some black shading. The object was approximately 7 to 8 feet wide at the bottom and five feet wide at the top. The object was approximately 12 to 13 feet tall. The object made no sound. There were no lights on the object. There were no markings. There were two tubes coming out of the bottom of the object. These tubes were approximately four feet long. One tube was straight. The other tube was straight and then kinked at about 45 degrees three feet from the bottom of the object. The tubes were about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter. The object seemed to be covered with scales or tiles and you could see through the object near the top, about 12 inches from the top.  By this time I called very loudly for my wife. She came outside. I was across the street between the two houses and told her to go and get my binoculars (7x50). She returned a minute later and said she could not find my binoculars. Very determined I said to her, Go find my binoculars.  Finally my wife came running across the street with my binoculars. I ran back to the street and watched the object continue to fly above the tree tops. It seemed to go up and down to stay right above the tree tops as it flew away. I watched the object through my binoculars for about 10 minutes until it became a speck in the binoculars.  Then 4 golden disks appeared around the speck and in a moment the disks and object disappeared. The sighting lasted about 15 minutes,(4 to 5 minutes without binoculars and about 10 minutes with binoculars.)  I sketched or drew a diagram of the object on Monday, 18 June 1990. This was the day after I sighted the flying object. Now 15 years later (27 June 2005), I have Xeroxed my sketch at a magnification of 4x and then scanned this very same hand-drawn figure electronically into a computer JPEG file. I have submitted my sketch on a diskette by U.S. Mail and also by Email.  I am very familiar with USAF aircraft. Kettering is located about 9 miles from Wright-Patterson AFB. So I have seen all kinds of military aircraft and civilian aircraft fly over Kettering Ohio over the past 32 years. The object I saw was not an AF aircraft. The object was not an unmanned AF reconnaissance aircraft. The object had no wings or air foils. The object was not a civilian aircraft. Over the years several ultra-lights have flown over our home and neighborhood. The flying object I saw was not an ultra-light aircraft.;39.682373714286;-84.1592468571433

Six orange lights in the northern sky, originally in a formation until moving around and fading away.;2015-09-28 20:29:00;1 minute;Six orange lights in the northern sky, originally in a formation until moving around and fading away Driving westbound on E. Dorothy Lane, myself and two friends saw six orange lights in the northern sky at a high altitude.   At first, five of them appeared to be in a triangular formation, sitting stationary, and the sixth was farther away, more north-east.   After about thirty seconds the five originally in a formation started moving around one another until fading away.  The sixth light never moved but eventually faded off as well.;39.682373714286;-84.1592468571433
A craft composed of two parallel outside cylinders and made of highly reflective metal flew slowly past my home at 6000 feet.;2016-09-04 19:55:00;2 minutes;A craft composed of two parallel outside cylinders and made of highly reflective metal flew slowly past my home at 6000 feet. I was setting up my 16-inch telescope in my driveway.  The sky was clear and very blue.  When I looked up towards my garage I saw this craft at an altitude of about 6000 feet.  It was colored aluminum and highly reflective.   The craft seemed to be stopped then moved off at a slow pace.  The craft moved off at a 45 degree angle to my position in my driveway.  According to google, the sun set at 8:02 pm on the 4th of September in Dayton, Ohio.   The craft was composed of two outside cylinders.  Each cylinder was approximately 10 feet in diameter and approximately 40 feet long.  The cylinders were connected by two cross-members.  One cross member connected the two cylinders in the front.  The other cross-member connected the two cylinders in the back.  The top of the rear cross member sat above the top of the two cylinders.  The cross members were about forty feet wide. This made the overall appearance of the craft square.  There were no wings and there was no tail!.  I heard no sound.  I saw no contrails.  I saw no markings.  I saw no lights on the craft.;39.682373714286;-84.1592468571433
