It was a fairly dim, difuse red glow, circular to oval in shape, and about one and a half to two times the size of the full moon.  It was a cloudy night and I may have been seeing it thought the clouds. As I watched, the glow moved slowly to the east.  As it got nearly to the horizon, it seemed to get somewhat dimmer and more elongnated.  Just before it reached the horizon it seemed to fade quickly and disappear, although it's hard to be sure about that because soom branches were in the way.  I continued east three to four miles, but saw nothing further. I am a letter carrier in this area and have never reported a UFO before.;39.682373714286;-84.1592468571433

Saw what I thought was a meteor before it stopped, hovered, moved around a little bit, then disappeared.;2020-06-02 21:15:00;10-15 seconds;Saw what I thought was a meteor before it stopped, hovered, moved around a little bit, then disappeared. Friend and I were coming home from a park where we were taking moon pics.  Sky was not dark but mostly twilight. Moon was bright but no Stars visible yet. We kept looking at the moon as we walked and after a minute we saw what looked like a meteor next to the moon.  It streaked down for a few seconds just like a meteor but then stopped. The object was still visible as a point of light getting dimmer and brighter as it appeared to hover although I couldnâ€™t say how high it was. I just figured it was very high.  Object then slowly meandered about for about ten seconds on a generally north course.  Object then came stationary for a second then completely winked out.;39.682373714286;-84.1592468571433
