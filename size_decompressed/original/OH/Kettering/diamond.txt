Multiple UFOs seen over East Dorothy Lane;2009-07-13 01:00:00;10 minutes;Multiple UFOs seen over East Dorothy Lane I don't recall ever seeing a UFO before. I am not certain if what I saw were really UFO's or just planes but planes are very doubtful.  I was sitting on my porch at 1 AM. (I live off of East Dorothy Lane). I was having a cigarettes and I saw some sort of flying object. It seemed to be diamond shaped. I couldn't actually make out the object itself. It has 4 lights. 2 lights were white. Another was green. And another was red. The green and red lights were blinking.  It flew over and made a noise smiliar to a plane. In this area, there are quite a few planes but the planes are always slightly lower to the ground. This one was much higher up.  After disregarding this one as just the usual plane, a few more appeared and they were up higher. They didn't seem to be moving at all. I went back out later and they were still there. They were so far up that it was hard to make them out. They could have been easily dismissed as stars if you didn't look hard enough. Faintly, I could see the blinking red and green lights.  I have been seeing these aircrafts for the last couple nights now and would like some sort of feedback.;39.682373714286;-84.1592468571433
