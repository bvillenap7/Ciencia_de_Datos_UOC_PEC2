aluminum-type disk with hump.;2010-09-17 16:30:00;1 minute;aluminum-type disk with hump I was sitting on my folding chair watering the lawn on the eastern side of my home.  July, August, and September were very dry months so I was watering the grass.  As I sat there, an AF passenger Jet flew  by heading  towards Wright Patterson AFB.  The Jet was painted pure white so I assume it was an AF air ambulance.  It was at about 3000 feet altitude heading slowly towards the base.  I watched it for a long time until it became a small spot as it neared the base.  My eyes and sight then returned back to the spot where I first saw the AF Jet.  Then I noticed a circular disk hovering above the path and displaced somewhat to the south from the path the AF Jet followed towards WPAFB.  Perhaps at an altitude of 5000 feet and 1000 feet to the south.  This disk was only about 40 feet wide but it was thick and the edges were very rounded.  It appeared to be metallic and aluminum-like.  There was a disk-like hump in the middle of and on top of the thick bottom disk.  And this disk had very w! ell rounded edges also.  This whole structure was pitched down at an angle of sixty degrees as if it had been viewing the AF Jet that flew by.   Now here is the kicker about this craft.  I could not see the rear portion of this craft because it seemed to be hidden by the sky.  This craft seemed to coming through a hole in the sky and I could not see the rear of this craft.  As I watched it I said to myself “ this is interesting.”  Then after awhile, it appeared that the craft moved back into the hole in the sky.  I could not see it anymore.  I then watched this position in the sky for a long time but the craft did not reappear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.682373714286;-84.1592468571433
8x discs, in perfect formation, flying west to east without a sound, and a course change, heading to Wright Patterson Air Force Base.;2015-03-21 21:17:00;4 seconds;(8) disc's in perfect formation flying west to east without a sound, and a course change, heading to Wright Patterson Air Force Base. My wife and I were picking up street trash last night, and I was observing the sky with night vision goggles like I always do.  About 1000 feet up moving west to east at an incredible velocity I observed a formation of (7) ships on the left with one on the right flying like a group of geese.   They were perfectly synchronized as if one body. They made no sound whatsoever.  It was quite dark, and they could not be seen with the naked eye.   When the formation got over Woodman drive they took a 20 degree north east course change, heading directly for Wright Patterson Air Force Base.  Night vision has a green cast so there was no identifiable color to the ships.  They appeared to be disc shaped.  Absolutely Fantastic !;39.682373714286;-84.1592468571433
