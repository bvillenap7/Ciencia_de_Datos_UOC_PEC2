I rolled my trash containers down my driveway to our street at about 6:30 pm or 18:30 hours.  After I finished dinner and washed dishes, I took two small bundles of trash down to my trash containers.   As I  reached the bottom of the driveway I turned left (west) to put my bundles into my trash containers.  As I looked up after turning left I was astounded.  I saw two gigantic beams of light coming from the sky.  The beams of light were aimed at the ground right beyond our neighborhood.  From my perspective, the beams made  more than a 45 degree slant angle from the sky to the ground.  These beams were huge.  The width of these beams were about 80 feet and 60 feet in diameter respectively.  These beams had very little spread.  They were located about 1/2 mile away from my location.  The beams were more of a washed out white.  The beam edges were very sharp. The beams were very close together.  There was a distance of about 20 feet separating one beam from the next.  The trees on my left were preventing me from seeing the source of these beams.  Then bang both beams were turned off very suddenly.  I heard no noise.  I saw no craft.  I was astounded.  I know of no aerial or atmospheric phenomena that can cause such beams.  A long time ago WPAFB were testing airborne to ground bright beams.  But they were very small compared to what I observed.  50 UAVs could not duplicate what I observed.  I did not call local authorities.  I did not call Federal Authorities.  I did not call WPAFB.  I did not call the local paper, radio or TV stations.  I did not take a pic.;39.682373714286;-84.1592468571433
