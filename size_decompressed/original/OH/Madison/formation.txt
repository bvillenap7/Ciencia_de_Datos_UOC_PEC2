I met some friends at a local winery. we had two drinks and on the way out we stopped to look at the stars and we saw what looked like 3 stars moving in single file.  At first I thought veunus was the space shuttle since they were moving near it and it being the brightest object he moving stars gave me this illusion briefly.  as we got our bearings we saw the objects that were about as bright as a star in the sky were moving.  As we watched more were traveling in the same line.  we counted 11 all perfectly spaced apart all going the exact same speed in a perfect straight line.  They did not appear to be going super fast but they were high up.  They never deviated from trajectory never changed the spacing that was equal.  It was an amazing thing to see.;41.802;-81.0560999999999
