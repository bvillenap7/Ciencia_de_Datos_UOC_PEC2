Bright white light abruptly disappears in identical fashion as other examined tapes of UFO's;2003-10-03 06:45:00;5 seconds;Bright white light abruptly disappears in identical fashion as other examined tapes of UFO's My sister and I were being driven to school by my aunt, and while driving on a road with few houses, we noticed clearly in the sky a bright white light, appearing very close to ground level. We noticed it, and but five seconds later, the object suddenly vanishes, but in a very peculiar manner. The object first seemed to shrink, and then disappear, although I could see the faintest trace of a trail of white light as the object vanished. I must remark that the way in which this object disappeared is IDENTICAL to the way another UFO faded away when examined on slow motion on a tape - UFO'S X-POSED - comprised of the home videos of many witnesses.  I must also remark that I witnessed, on the same road on a prior date, a long, white cigar-shaped object, which I watched until we turned on to another road.  I submitted at one time a report that my grandmother witnessed - a white light that followed her on her way to work - although I mistakenly reported the year to be 2003, when it occurred 09/01/02.;41.802;-81.0560999999999
Multi-colored, flashing lights spotted over Lake Erie in North sky.  Moved E to W and thought it was space station.;2016-10-15 20:20:00;continuous;multi colored, flashing lights spotted over lake erie in North sky.  Moved East to West and thought it was space station that I was searching for at 8:25 PM.  However this had many lights that seemed to fan out from rear.  The object was very far and about the size that I thought the space station would be.   I have Stargazer app and nothing was in the area.  THEN this moved up and down, and East to West!   Then seemed to be stationary out over lake in the North  East sky about 45 degrees up and faded in and out..  No clouds…  Disappears for a while, and it is back right now.   I have three witnesses and left messages with channel five and 19 in Cleveland.;41.802;-81.0560999999999
 I looked up at the moon and just to the right of it there were 3 lights in line.  ((anonymous report));2019-07-11 12:00:00;1-2 minutes;I was just cleaning up and coming inside from having a fire.  And I looked up at the moon and just to the right of it there were 3 lights in a straight line moving from west to east crossing infront of my view of the moon.  These lights did not look like any aircraft I've seen, it did not have any blinking lights and it was moving considerably faster then the airplanes I typically see overhead.  These lights were also really bright and from what I was seeing the lights had almost a bluish green tint to them.  The whole thing lasted only a few minutes and they were out of view.  Certainly peaked my interest!;41.802;-81.0560999999999
Two lights merged into one and then faded out.  ((anonymous report));2019-09-03 21:20:00;~2 minutes;Two lights merged into one and then faded out We were driving towards home on Dayton Rd. In Madison.  Off to the West, appeared to be close to the Madison/Painesville line,  I saw two lights, at first glance, thought they were stars but then noticed they just looked a bit different and too large.  Within seconds the lights slowly moved towards each other, then merged into one and then faded out completely.  Did not see them again.  The light was not bright like that of a plane, it was more ambient.   Hard to describe, but definitely was odd.

I’ve always believed in aliens for sure but maybe it’s cause I’ve been watching A LOT of ancient aliens but anyways, I was driving home;2020-03-17 16:30:00;1/60 minute;I’ve always believed in aliens for sure but maybe it’s cause I’ve been watching A LOT of ancient aliens but anyways, I was driving home down the road and I always look at the stars to see how many are out.  Orion’s Belt is my favorite and as I’m searching for it, I see this light moving at a slow pace and at first I thought it could be a plane BUT planes have that blinking red light and there was no red light.  So my second though was a shooting star, but those are faster and you seem them for a quick second.  I looked at my boyfriend and said “oh my goodness do you see that?”  And he did so I knew I wasn’t like seeing things.  And then all of a sudden it went zooop!  (That is me describing the fast motion it did) and it disappeared and I looked at him and said holy ((deleted)) I just saw a UFO there’s no way it wasn’t. So now, here I am watching ancient aliens season 3, episode 7 “Aliens, Plagues and Epidemics”. I am now convinced that aliens have cause the COVID-19 virus just like they could of possibly in the past cause multiple viruses.  Thank you for listening to my ted talk.  PS this is dead ass no cap.;41.802;-81.0560999999999
