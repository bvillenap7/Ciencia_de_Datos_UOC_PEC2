3 bright whitish lights that changed formation moved slowly above the tree-line toward Lake Erie then disappeared.;2015-02-23 20:30:00;20 minutes;3 bright whitish lights that changed formation moved slowly above the tree-line toward Lake Erie then disappeared. 2/23/15, 8:30 pm.  Madison/Perry/Painesville, OH. My son and I saw a very large triangular formation very low in the western sky.  Three bright whitish  lights seemed to change formation from a triangle to an L-shape and seemed to appear as one light at times.    Difficult to estimate size, maybe as large as a football field and maybe a mile away at first, then it would seem closer, then move farther away again.  It was very erratic in shape, and distance.   It was probably more than one object.   We got in the car and followed it as it moved slowly northward toward Lake Erie.  It made no sound, and we kept losing sight of it due to the tree line.  We finally lost sight of it close to Painesville over Lake Erie near the Perry Nuclear Plant.   The sky is clear tonight and the quarter moon was quite high above the formation.   This thing was too large and low in the sky to be a plane or helicopter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.802;-81.0560999999999
