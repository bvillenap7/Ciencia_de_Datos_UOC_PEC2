Very Fast Moving Object;2000-07-15 20:50:00;2 seconds;Very Fast Moving Object We were driving north on Hubbard/Rt. 528 about 1/4 mile south of Lake Erie when we saw a cigar/cylinder shaped aircraft in a very high rate of speed very low to the ground (just above the tree line), but out over the lake. It was making no sound because we had the windows open and the radio was off. It did not leave a trail, and by the time we got to the lake, the object was no longer seen.;41.802;-81.0560999999999
