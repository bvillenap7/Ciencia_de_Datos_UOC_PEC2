At 10:07 pm. I was taking my dog out, I was facing north with a less than full moon to my right. I heard a strange repeating sound, very softly deedle..deedle...deedle...deedle. When I looked up I saw two faint dots of light movind from east to west. When my eyes adjusted you could see the two points of light were attached to the tips of a dark oval shaped object. I watched the object move from about ten o'clock to two o'clock in the sky, then lost it in the light of my light pole. I went inside to call a friend that lives close by and went back outside. While outside I was facing south, with the moon over my left shoulder. I was telling my friend about the first one when a three pairs of lights forming a triangle on angle came over my left shoulder and moved to the south east. With the light pole behind me I watched this one disappear about thirty degrees over the horizon. The only reason you could see the bodies of the objects is that they were darker than the surrounding sky. After seeing this I spoke exitedly to my friend, we both observed three aircraft in the western sky. The southern most turned out to be a plane, the other two hung in the sky to the west. You could see the colors of normal aircraft lights. My friend said he could hear the blades of the helicopter.;40.1075244851257;-83.1236828375292
Appearing in the west moving east a cigar shaped object reddish orange in color moving  fast  followed by what appeared to be a F 16;2010-06-17 21:00:00;One to Two Minutes;Appearing in the west moving east a cigar shaped object reddish orange in color moving  fast  followed by what appeared to be a F 16 At approximately 21:00 hours, I took my daughter for an evening bike ride when she ask me,Mommy what is that?  I looked up and saw moving west of the location I was facing of the moon, a cigar shaped object, reddish orange in color moving from east to west at very fast pace.  It was large enough to see the distinguished shape of a cigar. It did not flash light or blink and there was no sound.  I am 6ft. tall and if I were to point my hands in a clock type motion encompassing the entire sky from where I was standing, my right hand would be a 1 and my left at 9.  My daughter and I watched it for approximately one minute.  There were some people that came out and I ask them if they could see it which they could not because at that time it was already far west and then it vanished.   I was unable to keep up with it to take a picture or video with my phone.    Approximately 30 seconds, no more, a military jet appearing to be a F-16 followed the same path.  10 Minutes later we were back at home and saw the same jet flying back in the direction it had came from.;40.1075244851257;-83.1236828375292
