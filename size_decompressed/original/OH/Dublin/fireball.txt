Oval, orange-white, large candle/fireball floated slowly across the sky approx. 9pm at a smooth, steady speed. Like nothing weâ€™ve ever seen.  No sound heard.  My husband & I were on our nightly one mile stroll around the neighborhood.  Clear night. During our walk we saw it fly by twice, then fly high up into the sky at a faster speed and disappear.
