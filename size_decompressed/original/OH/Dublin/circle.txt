I observed 15-20 pinpoints of light, very high in the cloudless sky. My attention was drawn to them, as I was observing a low flying helicopter, because I saw a bright flash in the corner of my left eye.  The object's covered an area of the sky equivalent to an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper at arm's length.  They were in no particular formation. The lights themselves were roughly the size of an average star and similar in brightness, except for when they flashed.  The flash was very very bright considering the size of the objects it was almost blinding if you were looking at them when they flashed - like a camera flash, but slower and longer. Objects were viewed through a sliding glass door, at first.  Upon opening the door they appeared even brighter. As I observed them, some simply disappeared, but about 8 remained.   After a couple of seconds they began to move at a rate slightly faster than a commercial jet, at first.  One went west, one north, one east, and between 5 and 8 of them fanned out and moved in southerly directions.   When the group of objects moving south were nearly overhead, they accelerated rapidly out of my view. This morning I awoke with something under the skin of my left front collar bone.  The area was red, but no entry wound was noted.;40.1075244851257;-83.1236828375292
