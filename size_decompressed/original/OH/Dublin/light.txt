White Light Drops Behind Trees Quickly After Being Stationary In The Sky;2012-12-23 06:00:00;3 seconds;White Light Drops Behind Trees Quickly After Being Stationary In The Sky I decided to go for a run at 5:00 a.m. The sky was still very dark at this time without any clouds. When I reached Glacier Ridge Park at approximately 6:00 a.m. a light caught my eye that was about the relative size and shape of a star but was very bright and white.  The light abruptly dropped from the sky after being stationary in the sky.  The light fell behind the trees from the park in about a 3 second period which is beyond the physics any aircraft or satellite that I am familiar with. My hair stood up after seeing the event, and I immediately ran home.  I was not a believer before, but this has me sold. Another thing to take into consideration is that this light did not produce a streak when it dropped unlike an asteroid or comet.  I also looked at the flight pattern of the ISS and it was nowhere near the location nor did the ISS pass through my area in its flight route.;40.1075244851257;-83.1236828375292
5-6 red lights with faint orange rim traveling a slow speed from north to south like a small aircraft;2015-09-13 23:00:00;1-2 minutes;5-6 red lights with faint orange rim traveling a slow speed from north to south like a small aircraft. The time was the beginning the half time of Michigan State Oregon about 11:00 on September 12, 2015. I was walking the dog in Dublin, Ohio, and saw 4-5 individual red lights with slight orange rim in a group ( in somewhat of a line) moving south.  They appeared to be at an elevation similar to a small airplane (1000-2000 feet) and travelling about the same speed.  I was listening for sound of a propeller or jet engine, but there was no sound. As they slowly disappeared in the distance heading south another single light (same color) approached from the same direction as the others and on the same path.  It continued to the south until disappearing.;40.1075244851257;-83.1236828375292
