I couldn't make out a shape or craft as you call it.  But I was walking out to my car with my headphones in.  All of a sudden the sky lit up. I remember flinching because I was expecting a loud bang from heat lightning, but it wasn't lightning.  I looked up and saw a light shoot across the sky in a supersonic speed.  At first, I thought it could have been a shooting star, but the crazy thing was that it left a small trail of smoke, only for a split second, and then shot off out of sight in a nano second.  I watched the smoke trail dissipate into the sky in several seconds.  Whatever it was, was traveling at a speed 100x faster than any plane i've witnessed.  Also, the altitude couldn't have been more than a few thousand feet. I didn't hear anything, but like I said, I had headphones in.
