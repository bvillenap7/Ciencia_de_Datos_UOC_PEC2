Red light 1 blinking;2013-08-19 22:00:00;2 minutes;Red light 1 blinking Hello, me & my girlfriend were sitting in the car in the carriage place shopping center, there is also a nearby runway in a field.  I notice a large light in the sky I thought to be a plane because.  It had blinking lights, but after 10 minutes it never fades away.  Then there's an object which had 1 red light in front, 1 large red light in back which blinked on & off.  It immediately struck us as odd but unfortunately missed it w/ the cell cam  as it flew over us.  What can I say?  It looked like a disc.   It was small, low flying & made 0 sound.  I'm not a believer, but this was weird. As we walk in the grocery I'm looking at the first large light tht was sitting in the middle of the sky for now the last 20 min.  When we came out it as gone.  This could not have been a helicopter.  Thanks;40.1075244851257;-83.1236828375292
