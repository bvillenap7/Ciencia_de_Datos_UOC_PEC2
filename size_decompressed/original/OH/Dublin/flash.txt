I am not sure what shape it is, it's either roating or blanking, going at a very fast speed, it disappear for about a sec. then it reappear on the other side of sky, it was going straight. It was either roating like a football or blanking, looks more like roating, and when it's doing that, you can see it reflecting off sunlight. Much faster then a jet.;40.1075244851257;-83.1236828375292
