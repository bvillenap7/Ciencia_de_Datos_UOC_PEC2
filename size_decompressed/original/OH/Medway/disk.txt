Driving north on Osborne rd., north of the USAFB. Me and my boyfriend noticed bright lights above us in the sky.  Closer than usual. But then it would take off, stop, hover, take off then take a 90 degree turn at full speed.  It Zig Zagged all over the sky. we noticed other cars were pulled over so we got out and watched it until it flew south towards the USAFB.;39.8789;-84.0191
