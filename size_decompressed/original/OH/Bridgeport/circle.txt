Bright milk cap sized object  hovers then takes off into nothing.;2010-08-20 02:00:00;5 to 10 sec.;Bright milk cap sized object  hovers then takes off into nothing. I was at the grid iron pub in Bridgeport, Ohio with a few friends.  I walked outside to smoke a cigarette and couldnâ€™t help to notice a milk cap sized abject in the sky.  It appeared to as bright as the burning sun would be if seen at night.  The circular abject hovered stationary for about 3 to 4 seconds then took off across the sky at lightning speed then disappeared into nothing.
