A cloud lit up and changed to different colors in the middle of the night;2003-05-31 23:00:00;45sec.;A cloud lit up and changed to different colors in the middle of the night I'm not even sure if it was a UFO. Driving home at night we seen a large cloud lit up. We thought it to be lightning at first but the colors in the light kept changing from white to red to blue to green, etc.. And there was one thin beam of light that shinned down towards the earth. The lights stayed constant and did not flicker on and off like lightning does. After about a minute it was goen and the whole sky turned black again. It looked like the cloud was right over our town. In about 5 minutes we got home and our entire block had no electricity. we ask our grandma what time it went out. She said a couple of minutes before we got home. We called the cops to see why the electric was out and they did not know. I really just want to know what I saw.;41.2679;-82.8626
