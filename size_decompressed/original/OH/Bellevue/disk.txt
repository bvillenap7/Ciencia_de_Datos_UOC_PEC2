Small disk-shaped object with numerous green lights, moved left and right slowly.;2004-02-25 19:20:00;3 minutes;Small disk-shaped object with numerous green lights, moved left and right slowly. It was a fairly clear night out, but all I could see in the sky was the moon(of course) and the planet of Venus. I had decided to go outside and get some air, even though it was fairly colod out. I did, and I looked at Venus for a while. Suddenyl something appeared to the left of it. It was a very thin, disk-shaped object, with blue/green lights lining the whole side I could see. It stayed in the sky for a while, the began moving to my right. It didn't move very fast, but it began to go left and right, then stopped, and just kind of disappeared. I stood there in shock for a moment, then thought about what I had seen. This is not the first time I have seen a UFO in the area where I live.;41.2679;-82.8626
