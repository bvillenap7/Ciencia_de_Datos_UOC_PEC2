Both disappeared as soon as i clicked record on my phone camera.   Only got about 4 seconds of audio as soon as the objects disappeared.;41.2679;-82.8626
Six unidentified flying objects that where circular and orange in color.;2013-07-06 22:48:00;3 minutes;Six unidentified flying objects that where circular and orange in color. July 5th 2013  On my way home from the lake my buddy and I came across six unidentified orange circles on Mason Road near Bellevue, Ohio.  The circles were in a straight line and appeared to be hovering at the same exact altitude.  We stopped our truck to get a good look and three of the objects went straight up in the clouds and disappeared.  The last three of these objects stayed at the same exact spot.  After about a minute or two the last three disappeared.;41.2679;-82.8626
