4 round red & orange lights in the sky;2019-10-02 20:00:00;2 minutes;4 round red & orange lights in the sky 	My father and I enjoy watching the space station when it passes over our property. On the night of October 2, 2019 the station passed over at 7:13 pm. Around 20 till 8 Dad decided to take his dog inside the house. My step-son was outside with me at approximately 7:45 when we both saw 4 lights traveling very slowly (to us) in a row.  As the lights got closer they got larger.  They were red on the bottom and orangey-red on the top.  They made no sound whatever.  For help in your understanding,  Iâ€™m going to number them 1, 2, 3 and 4. 	My step-son ran into the house to get my dad and my husband to come out and see this, and they did.  The lights came from what I perceive as the north-west, going in a southerly direction.  Numbers 1 and 2 stopped and numbers 3 and 4 flew sideways and caught up with the first two, forming a perfect square and hovered there for about 20 seconds.  By this time they appeared about the size of a saucer that is put under a cup.  There was absolutely no sound coming from them.  After hovering there, number 1 raised up and flew west. Number 2 raised up and flew west also, but in a more northerly direction. The other two raised up and disappeared. I would estimate that all four had disappeared from view within 3 seconds. I cannot explain what I saw any more than this.;40.5319;-81.4725999999997
