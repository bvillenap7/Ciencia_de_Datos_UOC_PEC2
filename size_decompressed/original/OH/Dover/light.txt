Strange star like object that was extremely bright and then dimmed and became bright again many times.;2005-11-24 19:00:00;4 Hours;Strange star like object that was extremely bright and then dimmed and became bright again many times. Earlier this evening, we saw a extremely bright light in the south sky at about 7:00PM EST. As we watched this light, it would slowly begin to dim, and then it would dim to a point where it became a dim reddish color and then disappear. Then suddenly it would come back with full brightness, and then it would start to dim again and then come back, it was very irregular. There was also a plane or helicopter that was observing the object from the sky, passing back and forth by it. We would appreciate any explanation of this sighting, or if anyone else has seen this. Please give me your opinion. Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus.  PD));40.5319;-81.4725999999997
Three lights moving at a very fast rate of speed across the night sky;2017-12-16 02:00:00;5 minutes;Three lights moving at a very fast rate of speed across the night sky I took the dog out pee. i was looking at the Big Dipper when I first saw one dim light,then I saw two other lights following in a triangle shape.  The three lights moved across the sky with no sound and at a very fast pace.  The two outside lights moved to the center light and then went back to their first location.  The altitude of the lights looked to be like that of a satellite or the ISS flying over.  The lights went from overhead to the horizon in 2 to3 seconds.  I have watched countless satellites and aircraft, but have never seen anything like this.;40.5319;-81.4725999999997
