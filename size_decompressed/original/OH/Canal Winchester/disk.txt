Yellow/Orange pulsating disk moving E to W at 10k foot.;2020-11-08 18:44:00;1.40 minutes;Yellow / Orange pulsating disk moving E to W at 10k foot. My neighbor and I were outside. I saw object coming from the East moving towards the West. Object had no red, green or strobe like an airplane. No sound either. It was around 5-10 thousand feet in the air. It was moving slow about 200 knots then slowed down almost to a complete stop above both my neighbor and I. It then continued West and speeded up then it vanished. I  have been watching the sky since I was 10 years old. I am 58 now. I own 2 advanced telescopes. I have NEVER seen a UFO until yesterday. I have seen in the past Apollo, Apollo- Soyuz, the space shuttle, ISS all time, countless asteroids and countless satellites but NEVER anything like this pulsating orange / yellow object in the sky. I also have it all on video.;39.8348999999999;-82.8044000000005
