3 bright lights directly in a row not moving and no sound.;2019-01-25 06:45:00;10 minutes;3 bright lights directly in a row not moving and no sound. I was driving to work on 1/25/19 around 6:45am going east out of Columbus on State Route 33 in Central Ohio.  I noticed there were 3 bright lights to my southeast in the sky.  At first, I thought it was a set of military helicopters because Rickenbacker Air Force Base is close by.  I see helicopters flying in a straight line formation all the time.  As I got closer to my exit, I continued to notice the lights.  I took the Diley Road exit off State Route 33 and come to a stop at the light on the exit ramp.  At that point, I started to really pay attention to the lights.  There were defiantly 3 lights and they were in a perfectly straight line.  2 were brighter than the third.  The one I could see on my left was the brightest.  There was no sound and the lights did not move for the 2 minutes I sat at the light waiting to turn.  At that point, I decided to take a picture.  As I continued on my way to work, I had to stop at a stop sign 1 minute from the stopligh! t on the exit ramp.  At the stop sign, I was still facing the same southeast direction.  The 3 lights were in the same area of the sky, not moving, and making no sound.  After I made a left turn at the stop sign, I was traveling north and no longer facing in the direction of the lights and could not tell if they were still there.  I have never seen a UFO and not 100% sure I believe in them.  I have seen lights in the sky before, but I can always figure out what I am seeing.  This time I could not tell what I was looking at.  I couldn't get over the fact that they were in a perfectly straight line and not moving at all.  I drive this route every day and have never seen anything like this.  I honestly can't say what I was witnessing, but I do know that it was unusual and just gave me that feeling it was not normal.;39.8348999999999;-82.8044000000005
