Stadium sized triangular craft flew above sky near Columbus, Ohio.;2014-09-04 20:30:00;10 minutes;Stadium sized triangular craft flew above sky near Columbus, Ohio It was the size of a large stadium, 3 stories tall.  Triangular in shape with lights at the 2 back corners.   Would have thought it was a stealth fighter but it was very large, flying low, slow and seamed to be cruising at a low altitude not taking off or landing in my view.   Flew east to west and the Columbus airport is NW and the air base is south west.  Flew between the two airports.   Couldn't have landed at these two airports do to its size, but was flying low below the radar, so to speak.;39.8348999999999;-82.8044000000005
