It had one flashing red light above the spotlight and two white lights to each side of the object (4 total). Then another light appeared out of nowhere behind the first one. This one looked to be the same as the other. We quickly sped away in the car to his house about 500 meters away. When we got out of the car the first one was still directly above us as if it backed up to follow us. The object made no sound at all, even though it was so low to the ground. It was dark out. It was in a residential area so there were houses and trees around. The object was rather large (bigger than any plane around here) We saw two of them, one was REALLY close the other was about 100 meters behind the other. Both of them were hovering. They were both dark in color, either black or gray. The spotlights were very bright.;39.0234999999998;-84.2082999999994

Once the light was directly west of my location it disappeared.  Then a few minutes later same/another light showed up in the same area/directions of the first.  This reoccurred estimated 6 times for the next 30 minutes.  I went from my back yard to the front and attempted to capture the object on my phone.   I was able to capture it in photo and video.;39.0234999999998;-84.2082999999994
Light in the sky;2020-08-27 23:53:00;45 seconds;We were driving headed west on 125 when we noticed a light in the sky in the distance.  From the car it looked a bright star that was moving to left, then seemed to turn in a circular pattern towards the right.  It then moved left again before completely disappearing like someone turned a light off.  This lasted about 45 seconds.  Two witnesses both in the car.;39.0234999999998;-84.2082999999994
