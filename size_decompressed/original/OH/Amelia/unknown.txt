Frisby-like sound outside of window around midnight.;2006-10-02 00:16:00;Seconds;Frisby-like sound outside of window around midnight. I was doing my math homework and I heard a noise outside of my open window, it was unlike anything I've heard before.  It was extremely fast.  The only thing I can compare the sound to is a frisby when it flies by your ear.  I was to afraid to look outside of the window or go to sleep for that matter.;39.0234999999998;-84.2082999999994
