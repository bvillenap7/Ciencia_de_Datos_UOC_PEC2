SILENT OBJECT OVER AMELIA OHIO 3/23/08  1:30AM;2008-03-23 01:30:00;1 minute;SILENT OBJECT OVER AMELIA, OHIO, 3/23/08  1:30 AM 3/23/08 approx. 1:30 A.M. Amelia, Ohio  While on the back deck of a friend’s house, saw an object moving slowly from the northwest to southeast at an altitude roughly between 125 and 250ft above the ground. It was not much higher than the tree line. I work in the defense industry, and I’m an aircraft technician by trade, and consider myself very familiar with many different types of aircraft. However, this was something I’ve never seen or heard about in the industry. This object came within about 100 yards from where I was standing, at roughly the earlier stated altitude of 125-250ft above the ground. This object had a very bright light at the bottom of it, which looked to be encased in a housing of some sort, because it gave off a slight lampshade affect directly above the light itself allowing me to see that it was attached to an object. The shape reminded me of  a canister, similar to an aluminum soda can, but again making out the object above the light was somewhat difficult because the light was so bright. I could see that above the main light there was no sort of lighting on the object. The main light itself was not bright white, but off white to a yellowish white. The light was very similar in color to a set of lights you might see over a highway or large parking lot, not quite bright white, but an off white. My best estimate was that this object was 4 to 6 feet in width and approximately 6 to 8 feet in height including the light. As this object approached just above the tree line from the northwest, it must have taken close to  15 seconds to reach its closest point to me, again roughly 100 yards from where I was standing. It looked to be moving very slowly under 20mph. As the object reached its closest point to me, I opened the back door, and instructed my friends to come look at the object. Four other people besides myself witnessed this from this time on. When the object was at it’s closest, it appeared to stop for roughly 10 seconds, when I noticed a slight rocking motion from it. It looked like the craft stopping caused the rocking motion, which appeared to rock 1 or 2 feet in both directions. The object made no sound at all, during the complete time I witnessed it. After the object paused in place for roughly 10 seconds, it changed it’s original direction towards the southeast, to the southwest. From this point it stayed in a straight line, moving slowly above the tree line, for another 20 seconds or so, when the light suddenly went out for 3 to 5 seconds, and suddenly reappeared for another few seconds then disappeared for good. After the object changed direction, although still moving slowly, did pickup some speed possibly 30 to 40mph until I last saw it. My impression of this sighting, was that it was very likely manmade, and reminded me of some sort of surveillance craft. It was not like anything I have witnessed or heard about in the industry, but did not do anything beyond current defense technology. I was however very surprised that it did not make ANY noise whatsoever.;39.0234999999998;-84.2082999999994
