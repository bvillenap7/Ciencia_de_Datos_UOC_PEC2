I saw a large, orange circle rise over the house across the street.  At first I thought that their house was on fire because the object had the color of a campfire, rather dull, and pulsated slightly, as a flame would.  Then as it crossed the sky, I realized that the object was moving rather slowly and without sound. It was too low to be an airplane and too slow.  It was about 300 feet in the air and traveled at the speed of a hot air balloon until it disappeared over the tree line.  It was traveling SE to NW, and I observed it for about a minute.   I am a Private Duty Pediatric Nurse, and I care for patient in her home.  I was at work at the time, and saw the object out of my patients room, then went outside to further investigate the object.  It was around 9:30pm.;39.0234999999998;-84.2082999999994
