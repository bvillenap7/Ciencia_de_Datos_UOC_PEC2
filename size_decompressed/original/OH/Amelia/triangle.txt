Strange triangular shaped object over Cincinnati, Ohio.;2010-04-08 01:34:00;10 seconds;Strange triangular shaped object over Cincinnati, Ohio. At 1:34 AM on Thursday, April 8th 2010 I was almost asleep. I heard an extremely loud noise, like loud wind, even though all of the windows were shut. I looked to see the time but the power had flashed off, but came on as the object left the area. I guessed that it was the storm that was nearing but as I looked out my window a saw a huge triangular shaped object, grayish white in color, close to the ground. It was moving quite slow. After a minute it sped up to speeds way beyond that of an airplane. It was headed west but at the last second it made a sharp turn to the left (south) to join two other crafts just like itself, but smaller. Each of them was shaped like triangles and had white lights on each point.;39.0234999999998;-84.2082999999994
