Bright white orb released 2 smaller green orbs;2020-05-30 23:15:00;~15 minutes;Bright white orb released 2 smaller green orbs UFO – Cincinnati ,Ohio   Bright red very large orb heading from the west to the east travelling at a high rate of speed came to a dead stop.  The orb then turned color from a bright red to a very bright white.  It then released a small green orb out of the bottom.  The green orb started a slow eastern trajectory then gained speed out of sight.  The very bright white ‘mother’ orb still stationary turned back to bright red and traced its original path back west.   A few minuets later the bright red orb came back and stopped again and again it turned bright white and another bright green small orb was released from the bottom.  The green orb took the same path to the east as the first one and in the same manner.  The ‘mother’ again turned back to bright red and took a western trajectory at a high rate of speed and continued out of sight.  I stayed outside for about 15 minuets watching the sky but it did not return.;39.0234999999998;-84.2082999999994
