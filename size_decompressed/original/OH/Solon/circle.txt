red glowing circular object moving at high speed;2000-06-15 22:00:00;15-30 sec;red glowing circular object moving at high speed I was sitting outside looking at the stars, weather was clear, the only illumination was from city light reflection.  I observed a round shape approach from the west moving to the east.  The shape was glowing a dull red and was the size of a dime held out at arms length.  It gave the impression of being at very high alltitude.  The shape moved at a rapid rate towards the east until it was approx. 3/4 across the sky then made a sweeping 90 degree turn and headed south.  The shape showed no sign of decreasing speed when it executed the turn, the manuver took no more than 1-2 seconds.  As the shape moved off to the south it faded away.  There was no sound associated with the shape.  The shape also showed no navigation lights or strobes as would be displayed by an aircraft, there were no lights other than the dull glowing red color the was evenly distributed over the entire shape.  I am a private pilot, and former police officer.  I have no explination for what the shape may have been, but it did not appear to show any characteristics of any aircraft that I am familiar with;41.3881000000001;-81.4380999999999
