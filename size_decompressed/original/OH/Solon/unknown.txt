She woke up from a sound sleep next to her husband because she thought she had heard a noise.  When she looked out the window, she saw what she initially thought was a large black cloud passing over the house from the trees in the backyard.  Quickly she realized that it was not a cloud, and had white light coming from it.   e bottom looked a bit like the crosses in an apple-pie crust.  She was so terrified that she couldn't move, and couldn't turn to her husband to wake him.  It slowly drifted over the house, and was completely soundless.  She remembers clearly asking herself if she was asleep, and came up with a definite no. She seemed to have no definite ending to the story... The next thing she knew it was the next day.  This event is scarily reminiscent of the account listed on  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05815.html ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
