Cream (light tan) colored half circle  near Richmond Rd. Aurora Rd Intersection north of Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetary.;2003-10-30 04:00:00;10 seconds;Cream (light tan) colored half circle  near Richmond Rd. Aurora Rd Intersection north of Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetary. I was a passenger in a car driving North on Richmond Road just past Columbus Road when I noticed something slowly gliding across the sky straight ahead. It was approx. 100 ft. above the trees on the west side of Richmond Road past the Aurora Road Intersection (across from Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery). The object was going approx. 15 mph and went behind the trees. I did not see it after that. It was a half circle shaped cream (light tan) colored object. It was close enough to see it was not a helicopter (no propellers visible). It was also not a blimp (no motor on underside,no markings).;41.3881000000001;-81.4380999999999

Observed an unknown object flying over a cloud that resembled a helicopter with no rotors.;2021-06-23 15:15:00;5 minutes;Observed an unknown object flying over a cloud that resembled a helicopter with no rotors. On June 23rd, 2021 at approximately 3:15pm, in Solon, Ohio, I had an unusual and unexplained sighting directly overhead. It was a very clear and sunny afternoon with a lot of smaller low altitude clouds like stratus or cumulus(looked like cotton balls). I was five to ten miles from the nearest airport, and there were small private planes in the area at the time of the sighting. I was standing in a parking lot when I heard what sounded like a low flying plane that was revving up. It sounded bigger than a Cessna 150 due to the high volume level, but I couldn't see it, probably because of the large building I was next to. That got me to looking around to see if I could spot it. I looked all around, then straight up. Directly above me was one of those smaller clouds I mentioned. I'm estimating it's altitude at between 6 and 10 thousand feet. Approaching the cloud, not moving very fast, was an object that at first glance I thought was a helicopter. I say that because I could see no wings and it had the general shape of a copter, but more rectangular with kind of a military look. It also had a thinner trailing section that resembled a helicopter's boom. It moved in a straight line. The odd thing is, I could not see any rotors. I was right under it and should have been able to see the main rotor spinning. At about the same time, the loud propeller sound I had been hearing started to fade, and I was listening for the signature whooping sound that helicopters make. I never heard  that sound. I continued to watch as the object actually flew over the small cloud and I continued to watch because I wanted to see it after it passed over the cloud. I must mention here that it was fairly calm and the clouds were moving slowly. I continued to watch as I anticipated the object coming into view again. It was taking so long that I wondered if it was a helicopter that was hovering above the cloud. It shouldn't have taken more than about 15 seconds or so for the object to pass the cloud, given the observed speed of it going over.  I never saw it again, and I don't think I ever heard it. As I continued to watch, the cloud began breaking up and dissipating rapidly. From my perspective, it was as if the object just disappeared . I have a lifelong interest in ufology, and was long ago convinced that they represent a real nuts and bolts phenomenon. However, I'm not convinced of their origin one way or another. I'm skeptical of a lot of stories I've heard and seen and I try to remain objective. I also have a lifelong interest in anything that flies, especially jets and rockets. I consider myself to be a decent observer when it comes to identifying aircraft, at least in general terms. I would like to know if anyone else has seen an object of the same description.;41.3881000000001;-81.4380999999999
