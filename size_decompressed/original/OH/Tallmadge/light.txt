6 orange white strobing lights in Tallmadge night sky.;2014-08-23 21:25:00;5 minutes;6 orange white strobing lights in Tallmadge night sky. Sitting in the patio area of a local restaurant, I observed 4 orange/ white lights appear randomly in the N/NE night sky.   The lights appeared quickly, randomly moved in  various directions in relatively close proximity to each other.   Simultaneously, the lights flew off in various directions at a rate of speed it takes to blink an eye.  Immediately after the 4 lights disappeared, two lights appeared in the same location at the same time.   The second two lights were the same color, orange strobing to white.    The two lights strobed a minute or so then shot off to the west at the same time at unbelievable speed.;41.0972;-81.4219
