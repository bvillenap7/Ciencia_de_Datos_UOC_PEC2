Extremely bright cigar shaped craft over Tallmadge, Ohio.;2011-01-22 18:45:00;2-3 Minutes;Extremely bright cigar shaped craft over Tallmadge, Ohio. It was about 6:45pm on Saturday, January 22, 2011.  My mom and I were driving home.  We were about a minute from our house when we saw a cigar shaped craft.  At first my mom was trying to figure out what kind of aircraft it was because it had so many lights.  It had one flashing red  light on the bottom of the craft but was flying extremely low and the craft had lights all along the side of it that were extremely bright.  They resembled windows or panels.  We stopped thinking it was a commercial plane because of the extremely low altitude it was flying at, and how bright it was.  The craft was flying too extremely  low to be a plane.  When we rounded a corner, I continued to look at it through the back window. As I was looking it completely stopped mid-flight.  It sat for approximately 1-2 seconds and then made what looked like a complete ninety degree turn.  I’ve never seen a commercial plane or any plane at all fly that low and certainly none of them are capable o! f stopping mid air.  We also never noticed any sound coming from the craft which doesn’t make sense considering how low it was flying.;41.0972;-81.4219
