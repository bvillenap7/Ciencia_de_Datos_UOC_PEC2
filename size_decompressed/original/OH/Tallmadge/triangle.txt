ufo lights seen in Tallmadge, Ohio ,beginning on 2-05-79;1979-02-05 21:00:00;1-2mins;ufo lights seen in Tallmadge, Ohio ,beginning on 2-05-79 (follow-up to 11/30/04 e-mail. 3 hemispheres (White) in each corner. One slow pulsing light in middle. Object went over in a slow-motion manner. No sound. Followed by 2 more in general area of 140 S. Thomas Rd.Tallmadge, Ohio. 02/25/79--ray brilliant mirror shiny copper color. Above power line in mobile home park ,where my father and I resided. He died 10/31/90. I was 23,and he was 55 at the time. Then March 4,1979. This last one seemed to co-related to day of century days and day since age indays since our birthdates --6-11-23---8562---9-24-55---20355 days added together 28917th day of century and age in days of father and son 28917. Look at Majestic 12 dates---Notice any dates ending in a 62 or 00. 36524 divided by 1/2 18262-Then go forward or bacwards every 100 days. Notice if you use a 1658 day algorithym added from 18262 you will eventually come to an even 36500 days! It is also strange that if you take 1658 day from the 1st wtc attack of 2-26-93 you will always come to 9-11 0f any year except  leap year years. 1658 days separated the Kennedy brothers death. Chech your ufo cases and see how many sightings occur with century dates ending in 62 0r 00. I would also look at century day dates ending in 04--adding this 1658 will land you on a date ending in a 62 for example 22762-Figure what the month day and year this corresponds to. This could be being used in time-series statistical calculations. These ufo sightings I reported--but not officially to the UFO Flying Saucer Investigating Committee,on 9-5-80. A ((name deleted)) was the main person. Then 6 days later an unmarked military green helicopter flew over low over the spot where the copper ray was over a power line at 12:15p.m. Thank you.;41.0972;-81.4219
Slow moving triangular shape---at least the light pattern,seen in tallmadge ohio  2-5-79;1979-02-25 21:00:00;9 mins.;Slow moving triangular shape---at least the light pattern,seen in tallmadge ohio  2-5-79 3 white hemisheres (one in each corner) Slow pulsing red light in the middle. No sound audible. Moving with a 'slow-motion'quality. When first appeared saw an amber light. Then during approach to witnesses saw the triangular light pattern.This was on the night of 2-5-79. Though heard nothing in the media about other seeing this object. If it was a real structure or a possible hologramic projection from an aircraft or satellite is unknown. Twenty days after this we saw--2-25-79 a brilliant copper colored ray--more rar than beam--extend out so far--but the source of this light could not see. Was above a power line. Television was on but picture went radically off the vertical-horizontal. Reported this to the Fling Saucer Investigating Committee Akron, Ohio 9-5-80. 9-11-80-Unmarked military helicopter fly-by,low, at 12:15pm.;41.0972;-81.4219
Triangle aircraft/UFO witnessed by pilot (ground observer) in Tallmadge Ohio;2006-12-15 17:30:00;60 seconds;Triangle aircraft/UFO witnessed by pilot (ground observer) in Tallmadge Ohio I was on the north side of the Tallmadge circle. The object was south of the circle, a few degrees above the horizon. I did lose sight of it a few times due to vacinity to trees (on the circle itself). I know it is difficult, even for proffesionals, to judge shape, distance, altitude, and speed of moving objects from the ground, but I will make my best guess.  The craft itself appeared to be the size of a commercial airline transport. It appeared to be low and slow, I would guess 2000'MSL and under 100KTS. The craft originated from the south west travelling north east. When it was due south of the circle, it vectored to its right, now heading south east. It travelled in this direction until obscured from sight by buildings and other ground clutter. During its turn to the south east, the craft appeared to bank much the way a conventional aircraft would.  Initially, I saw the craft from almost head on. It appeared to be a large aircraft with several landing lihghts (very bright, white lights, facing forward). During its turn and bank, I could see its underside. The ventral surface seemed to have a large white light at its tip, and two more aft of the nose. The second two were very far apart laterally, and appeared to be at the tail end of the craft, implying a delta or flying-wing shape. In the middle was another white light. There also appeared to be standard aviation anti-collision (strobe) lights about half way between the nose and tail, but no position (colored) lights, nor a red beacon.  I was standing outside, and the craft did not make any noise that I could hear over the sound of traffic. I would have suspected a jet powered aircraft in that proximity, but with exhaust facing away from me, to at least make the tell tale turbine whine A reciprocating engine aircraft of that size in that proximity would have made the ground shake.;41.0972;-81.4219
