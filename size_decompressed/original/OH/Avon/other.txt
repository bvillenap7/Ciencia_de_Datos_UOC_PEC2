Bright cigar shaped objects with two tails curving toward each other;2020-10-05 19:03:00;15 minutes or longer;Bright cigar shaped objects with two tails curving toward each other Costco parking lot: I was waiting in the car when I noticed a couple parked behind me looking at a small streak in the sky through binoculars and discussing what it might be. I got out my binoculars which we keep in the car for wildlife viewing during camping. This object looked like a small bright streak but up close it looked like a point of white light with two thin, curving tails bending toward each other. A few minutes later it was under the horizon (this was around dusk) and a second appeared higher up. It looked exactly the same through the binoculars. It dipped below the horizon after a few more minutes and a third appeared, higher up and seemingly out of nowhere. This time when I used the binoculars I could see blue and red swirls toward the front of this object and again, the same curving white tails. It disappeared within a few minutes, not going below the horizon like the first two but just disappeared where it had been a moment before. I took ph! otos and the objects look cigar shaped, but there was more to them as I described.;41.4481;-82.0177000000002
