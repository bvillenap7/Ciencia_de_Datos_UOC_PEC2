Oblong UFO with red/white lights (Elyria, OH);2008-10-16 19:35:00;5 minutes;Oblong UFO with red/white lights (Elyria, OH) My 20 year old daughter is a senior in college.  She has a 3.6 GPA and is a very bright, mature girl.  She has no prior experience with UFO's and has been a bit skeptical of them. She is not one to make up story. Tonight, she left class at approximately 19:35 p.m EST.  I called her cell phone as I often do to determine her time of arrival for dinner. When she answered my call, she was extremely upset and crying.  She stated that when she pulled onto North Abbe Road (heading North) in Elyria, OH there was a very large oblong object in the sky that was gray in color and had red and white flashing lights.  The object appeared to be sitting still and was not very high in the sky.  She was nearly hysterical.  I talked to her from my cell phone to her cell phone her entire drive home.  When she arrived home she was still very upset and crying.  I asked why she was so scared.  She couldn't explain why, she just kept saying I couldn't understand.  She almost immediately went to sleep which is highly unusual.  To type this report, I checked her cell phone log of recent calls for the time of the incident however, the call is not logged in her cell phone.  Finding this more than a bit odd, I then went to my cell phone and the call to her cell phone is clearly logged.  The call lasted 10 minutes and 35 seconds.  For the record, I am a professional business person.  I am convinced she saw a UFO.  My daughter would not make this up.;41.4481;-82.0177000000002
