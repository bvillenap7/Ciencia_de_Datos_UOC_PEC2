White light zoomed off to the west over Avon, OH;2012-03-21 06:23:00;5 seconds;White light zoomed off to the west over Avon, OH I was heading to work at 6:23 am on 3/21/2012, and happened to look up over the trees while I was sitting at a stop sign facing west.  Then I saw a single very bright light that zoomed off through the sky, and out of view past the trees.  I then proceeded to go down the street to the westbound road that I take to work, but by that time it was gone.;41.4481;-82.0177000000002
