I tell my mom and all three of us go out.  They were three orange lights that were still then started to move.  The lights were orange then turned a little red then back to orange.  Then they were moving forward and departing away from each other. The 2 lights that were behind the first one disappeared then the front one disappeared then came back again and then was gone at last.   My mom had her phone and was going to the camera by that time the lights had disappeared. The lights were in a fallen triangle shape, but then lost the shape.;41.4481;-82.0177000000002
Twin lights with gold fire like trails behind them moving in very controlled up and down flight patterns.;2014-05-24 21:10:00;15-30 minutes;Twin lights with gold fire like trails behind them moving in very controlled up and down flight patterns. We were traveling West on interstate 90.  I looked to the left which would be south of the interstate and saw two side by side bright lights with golden like trails behind them.   At first they appeared to be something taking a nose dive and crashing like footage that you see of air planes that have crashed at air shows.  Except it is at night and no craft was visible just two bright lights with fire like trails behind them.  They were not very high off of the horizon we lost sight of them in the trees.   After the first initial dive they started an up and down motion and then you could see the lights with trails appear to go out of alignment but then you could tell that it was just changing direction.  It had very fluid controlled movements.   Then we lost sight of it  behind the trees as we approached the toll booth.  After we got our ticket and were on the other side of the toll booth it was gone.   We then stopped a few miles down the road at the Travel Plaza and other people we talking about the same sighting.
