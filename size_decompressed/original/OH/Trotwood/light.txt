Several (Approx. 6) flying, flashing red lights in the sky. It was dark out and the sky was clear. I was in my front yard taking my dog out to pee. When I looked up, I saw them were swerving around in different directions, which struck me as odd. After about 2 minutes, I was called back into my house, they might have been visible longer. I got a video of it and immediately posted it to Instagram, however Androids take low quality videos so it's just darkness with my streetlight to the side and me saying I thought what was in the sky might be a UFO.;39.7945999999998;-84.3199999999998
