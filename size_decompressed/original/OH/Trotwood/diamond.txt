Bright object SHOT from sky onto earth while another hovered in the distance.;2012-07-28 23:50:00;20 minutes;Bright object SHOT from sky onto earth while another hovered in the distance. I, my daughter and common-law (foster)step-niece-in-law were driving South on I35 from Salem Ave. in Trotwood, OH.  We saw, to the right of the highway, about 100 feet above tree level, a bright orange/white light hovering, no sound.  As I continued driving, to the left a huge, bright, boulder-like ball of flame appeared out of no where and shot to the earth from the same distance level as the object to the right of the highway, into an area nearest Wolf Creek swamps.   The shining yellowish-white object flew in a decline of about 70 degrees.  I expected to hear a &quotkaBoom&quot, but there was absolutely no sound following its crash into wherever.  There was no trail of light behind it.  Suffice to say, the two people I was driving and I were in shock.  After dropping off one of the parties, my daughter and I continued driving on Derby toward Germantown in Jefferson Twnshp.  We noticed a second red glowing object hovering further southwest.  Turning East ! from Derby onto Germantown we spotted yet another, brighter low-hovering object.  This one was slowly gliding toward the west coming right toward our direction.  I opened my sunroof and moments later, my daughter and I was seeing the underbelly of what appeared to be a spheric object inside a diamond-shaped exterior, with lights on each of the 4 corners, the sphere was being held by some type of pole-like shape from each of the interior angles to that of the center object.  Upon driving past it, my daughter screamed that the object broke up into three separate parts and went in different directions!!!!!!;39.7945999999998;-84.3199999999998
