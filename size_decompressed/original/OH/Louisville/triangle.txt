They stopped and hover for a few minutes.  Then they always disappear when we take our eyes off of them.  We have seen them over 5 times since Summer of 2013.;40.8501000000001;-81.2583000000002

The light wasn't very high in the sky and as i watched it it went from one light to two to three in a very distinct triangle formation.  It stayed that way for maybe two minutes and then went back to one light and stayed above the tree line.;40.8501000000001;-81.2583000000002
