My girlfriend and I had gone outside to check her vehicle before she headed home to get ready for work.  The sky is very clear and looks beautiful.  To our amazement we see four tiny lighted circles so far away that they look like stars.  However they are moving at a fast rate, in a straight line, one behind the other.  One set is moving South West towards North East of our location.  The other pair North to South of our location.  They did not fly as if programmed by computer, but as if piloted by a person from inside the craft.  I have never seen anything like it before.   P.S. We went outside around 3:30 this morning and the lights had been visible for about five minutes.;40.8501000000001;-81.2583000000002
