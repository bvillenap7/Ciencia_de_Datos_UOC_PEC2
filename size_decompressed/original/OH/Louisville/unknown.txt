unknown aircraft seen trailed at low altitude be helicopter in stark county OH.;2002-09-19 23:45:00;45 sec;unknown aircraft seen trailed at low altitude be helicopter in stark county OH. I was lying in bed on the second floor of my home.My bed is right next to the window so i can enjoy the view.I heard a rotary wing aircraft approaching and sat up.Normaly just that sound wouldn't cause me to be curious ,but the fact that i was trained by the U.S. Army as an air defense early warning scout alerted me to the sound of the aircraft. It was very loud,like a large cargo helecopter or a smaller helo moving fast to keep up whith something.So i looked out and saw the exterior lights moving east southeast at approx. 200 feet.I started to look for a second helo thinking the sound could be from multiple craft and thats when i saw the large dark shape moving on the same azimuth.I could see no exterior lights and the shape was difficult to determine as i spoted it just before i lost line of sight.I climbed out the window onto the roof but could only see the exterior's of the helo continueing on an easterly course.;40.8501000000001;-81.2583000000002
Woke up by extreme bright light - object had red, yellow, green, and blue lights moved in a circular motion. Followed electrical towers;2004-04-22 00:10:00;Approx 20 min;Woke up by extreme bright light - object had red, yellow, green, and blue lights moved in a circular motion. Followed electrical towers My friend and her husband were woke up by an extremely bright light shining into their bedroom window. There are huge (she called them microwave electrical towers) near their home. They ran outside and saw an object in the sky with extremely bright lights, but they couldn't distinguish the shape. The object had red, yellow, green, and blue lights that were moving in a circular pattern. There was no sound and it was hovering over one of the towers near their home. The object then traveled slowly North along the same path as the other large towers and then turned at a 90 degree angle and disappeared into the distance. Their daughter, who is 19, also saw the object and was upset by the sight. For a short while after they went back to bed they heard a sound that she described - like a can of pop fizzing, but couldn't find out where the sound was coming from. My friends are in their mid 40's. What I thought was really strange is that my husband and I saw an object exactly as she described about 20 years ago in East Canton, which is about 7 miles from her home. She couldn't remember us telling her about what we had seen many years ago.;40.8501000000001;-81.2583000000002
