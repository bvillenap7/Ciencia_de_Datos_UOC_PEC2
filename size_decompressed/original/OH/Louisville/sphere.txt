Looked up in the sky, and seen a large sphere. The sphere had lights rotating around the edge.  Was headed eastward through downtown.  Once it passed town, it casually veered dorectly north, till it disappeared out of view.  The object made no sound. When i first seen the object it was so low to the ground I thought for sure it was going to land.  But it never did.  It definitely was not a helicopter, or a airplane.;40.8501000000001;-81.2583000000002
