Dimly;2012-08-12 21:40:00;45 seconds;Dimly Traveling home from a family dinner, we were just a few minutes from our house turning into the neighborhood adjacent to our own when a strange light caught my attention in the sky.  The reason it caught my attention was because it wasn't very high in the sky and it was a dim orange color, almost like a dull overhead highway light.  It was pretty still so I had time to notify my family in the car and the odd nature of it's position in the sky.  It wasn't high enough to be a plane (plus it wasn't moving) nor was it low enough to be a street light.  My wife reminded us that when we left there were several hot air balloons in the area, however it was pretty dark and it was unlikely they were still floating around. As we continued to drive we were now moving in a different direction so we were watching from the side window and now the object appeared to be almost like a fireball but we knew it wasn't because if it were an actual fireball it would have been much brighter however we thought it might be possible of it was a leftover hot air balloon in terrible distress.  We took another turn now heading towatds the object and were expecting to get a better view oit the front windshield when the object appeared further away even though we knew we were moving closer to it.  At this point the object gradually moved directly up and out of sight leading all of us to conclude that this was something very different.  We don't normally believe in such happenings but this occurrence doesn't leave a whole lot of other explanations that we are aware of which lead us to the iternet when we got home.  Most surprising from our internet research was reading other descriptions of sightings that included fireball like observations further validating what we know we observed.

Looked like a flaming ball shooting fireballs off it then it turned and sped off to the South, no way it was a plane or meteor;2019-08-03 21:30:00;1 minute;Looked like a flaming ball shooting fireballs off it then it turned and sped off to the South, no way it was a plane or meteor;40.8501000000001;-81.2583000000002
