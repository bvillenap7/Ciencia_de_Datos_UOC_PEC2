Sun was below horizon, but I could still clearly see multiple planes and their trails in the sky.  I noticed a bright red/orange flash very high in the sky (notably higher in the atmosphere than any normal air traffic. Immediately after the flash of color an all black object appeared and traveled in a perfect straight line in the sky from an 11 o’clock to a 2 o’clock position.  There was no sound, no trails of smoke, nothing except the black small circle object and then it disappeared completely from sight. Maybe a meteor that bounced off the atmosphere and back into space?;41.3959000000001;-82.0035
