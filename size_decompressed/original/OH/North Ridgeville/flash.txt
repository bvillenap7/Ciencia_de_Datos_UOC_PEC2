Bright lights darting in the sky;2008-07-12 00:00:00;30 seconds;Bright lights darting in the sky I was sitting in the backyard of my boyfriend's sisters house in North Ridgeville, Ohio. I was looking in the sky at the stars as I usually do to see the stars and to see if i could spot anything. I see unusual things that I can't explain. I seen a bright blue led colored light darting around. It was not moving in a particular way. I shouted to the family to look and everyone stood up and screamed, what the - is that?. We watched it dart around for a few seconds until it was no longer visible. But then my sister seen it again and we all ran to where she was standing and sure enough it was almost like it had come back towards us and then disappeared. It was a partly cloudy night and a little after midnight.;41.3959000000001;-82.0035
