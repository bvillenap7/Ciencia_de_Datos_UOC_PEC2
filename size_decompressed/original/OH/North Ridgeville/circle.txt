It was void of any sound and brilliant in color. I was driving my girl friend back from the ice cream store, we were on cook road in either North Ridgeville or North Olmsted,not sure of the border. We were heading west. It was approx. 9:30 pm, and I remember this because I played football and it was during the time of 2 a days. It was after practice. As we were travelling about 30 - 40 mph, I said in a panic voice, it's gonna to crash. Just above the tree line, to the left side of the road,I noticed a bright orange light moving from left to right,in front on us. I remember thinking at the time that the plane was on fire and it would certainly hit us. I slammed on the brakes. We came sliding to a stop in the center of the road, pointed slightly to the left, as I was going to veer under the plane as it went over the car, Cindy and I both noticed the orange glow off the chrome and the hood of the car. I tried to get out, but, the door was locked. I unlocked the door and got out. This is the scary part. I looked up and there was a perfectly round, bright orange, semi opague, 10 - 15 ft diameter, ball. I was so close to it, that if I had a step ladder and a broom, I could have hit it. No sound. I stood in amazement for about 5 to 7 seconds. Then I realized then what I was seeing. I was in awe. The object remained motionless. Then without warning it shot to the north towards lake Erie. It moved so fast I was barely able to follow it. It went out of sight. That was it. I lost time however, about 2 hours, I think. I have the need now after almost 30 years to try and find some answers. I hope I can speak with someone, not involved with the government. Thanks, ((initials deleted)) I am 45 years old. College educated. Normal average American. I am Not a Quack. I just would like to search for some answers.;41.3959000000001;-82.0035
Circular flying object with green and red lights in center.;2015-01-23 21:00:00;5 minutes;Circular flying object with green and red lights in center. I was driving from the gas station down Jaycox Road in North Ridgeville, Ohio, when I saw a circular shaped object in the sky.  It went from West to East very fast then stopped and went back West.   Once it returned back to its original spot when I first saw it, it started moving South, closer to my vehicle.  It eventually got close enough for me to see the lights.   It was a circular shaped object with a green light in the middle and 4 to 5 red circular lights that circled around the middle light.   I tried to look for it when I got home but it was gone.;41.3959000000001;-82.0035
