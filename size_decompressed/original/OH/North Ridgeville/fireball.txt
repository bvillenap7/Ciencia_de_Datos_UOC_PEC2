Orange fireball spotted north west of Cleveland near Lake Erie.;2014-04-20 21:00:00;2 minutes;Orange fireball spotted north west of Cleveland near Lake Erie. April 20th, 2014, at approximately 2100, I witnessed something strange in the sky northwest of North Ridgeville.   At a glance I thought it was mars but the object made me do a double take. Upon closer observation I found the object to be approximately three times the size of what Mars would be normally seen by the naked eye.  I would describe the object as being a pulsating fireball.   After observing the object for approximately two minutes, it disappeared.   I am a man of science and would expect there to be a logical explanation for the sighting.;41.3959000000001;-82.0035
Bright Blue Fireball falling and then vanished;2015-04-22 22:00:00;30 seconds;Bright Blue Fireball falling and then vanished I was driving down 480 East near North Ridgeville when I saw a bright blue flare like light fall from the sky.  It was a crystal clear night, stars were visible, and there was a surprising amount of air traffic out that night.  The light all of a sudden appeared and started to fall to the ground and vanished before it even hit the ground.  No explosions were seen or heard of anything hitting the ground.;41.3959000000001;-82.0035
