All of them came together in a circle extremely close to eachother then all of them broke away using maneuvering that our military can't do and there were also at least two of what i thought to be jets, only because i could hear the afterburners and i could see there jetstreams by the light of the moon.  well the ones i thought were ours weren't like flying directly at the flashing and blinking lights it was like they were either tracking whatever they were or observing them.  but every time they got even an inch closer the lights would be gone not like super fast but almost like they glided through the sky.the time now is 10:28pm im outside again and i can still make out a couple blinking lights and earlier there was only one of them that only would slowly light up red and slowly go dark again.  if anything changes ill try and post it on here.;41.3959000000001;-82.0035
