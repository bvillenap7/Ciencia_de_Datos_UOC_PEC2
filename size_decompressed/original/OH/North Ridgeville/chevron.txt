Bright object stationary over Ohio for 90 minutes.;2017-08-13 18:00:00;90 minutes;Bright object stationary over Ohio for 90 minutes. Today is a clear sky over North East Ohio.  We are 10 miles from Lake Erie.  At an almost straight up angle, a shiny object remained stationary for 90 minutes.   I retrieved my binoculars and we looked at it under 50 x 20 power.  The object looked like a chevron shaped object.  It only moved a slight bit.   We had 8 people in all viewing this thing.  It appeared to be almost as high as a 36,000 ft high jet that flew near it.  When it left it just disappeared.   No pics were taken as it was so high up.;41.3959000000001;-82.0035
