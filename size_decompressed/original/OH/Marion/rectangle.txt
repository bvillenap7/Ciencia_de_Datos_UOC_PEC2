rectangular object with lights falling seen by 2.;2019-07-08 23:02:00;2 minutes;rectangular object with lights falling seen by 2. I was trying to take a photo for the moon and stars.  It was falling straight down.  As I was taking the photos I thought I was photographing a falling star.  After processing the photos I realized it was not a falling star but an object that had lights on both sides and a small light on the back.  I only seen the object for approx. 2 mins before it was gone.;40.5912;-83.1258000000009
