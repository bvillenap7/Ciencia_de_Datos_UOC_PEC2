This one is a mystery to me.;2002-06-17 06:45:00;2 minutes;This one is a mystery to me. It was between 6:45 and 7am, and I was out on the front porch enjoying a beautiful double rainbow in the west, when a bright object appeared to the left of the rainbow and it was traveling in my direction, flying towards the sun.  My first thought was that it was an airplane and the sun was reflecting off of it, but as it came closer, it seemed to be rocking back and forth because the light seemed to be pulsating.  It looked so unusual that I continued to watch it, expecting to hear an airplane engine or some sound at any minute, but there was no sound coming from it.   As it passed over the house, it was still very bright, but I could see it well enough and could not see any wings.  At about that time, I heard an airplane engine, but another airplane came from the north and was flying south. I ran out into the front yard to continue watching the object, and once the object was between me and the sun, I could make out a very distinct disk shape.  (I was looking at it from behind).  It was still rocking back and forth as if in slow motion.  I always can pick out the airplanes, military planes, helicopters, etc.  Maybe the sun was playing tricks on my eyes, but I know that I can't explain this one.;40.5912;-83.1258000000009
