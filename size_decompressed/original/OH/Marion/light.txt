They both became stationary.   Then a 3rd one appeared out of nowhere.  It was solid until it reached the other 2, then flashed Red, yellow and white.  No flash pattern.   Then they all flew around at slow speed near a commercial airline following it,  then left at high rate of speed.  We thought one of them was going to crash into it.
