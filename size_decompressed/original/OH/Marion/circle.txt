All of the sudden, my dogs outside started barking and I heard a strange buzzing noise.  I looked out my bedroom window and I saw an object flying overhead.  It was in the shape of a circle.  It was very large, and gray, and there were lights outside of it, in a ring, that changed colors.  It went overhead once very fast, and then passed again very slowly.;40.5912;-83.1258000000009
