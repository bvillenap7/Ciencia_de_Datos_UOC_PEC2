The light changed from red to white but was not in a sequence similar to aircraft strobes. The closer I got to the object the larger it appeared. It was not traveling very fast so there was plenty of viewing time. I stopped at a stop sign and turned the vehicle off but did not here any engine noise from the object. The object continued east not in a straight line but in a slow oval like pattern.;40.4992;-83.9168
