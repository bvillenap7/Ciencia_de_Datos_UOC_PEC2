It was a faint orange red mist like circle with orb of light around it.  It was silent and i saw regular jets in flight in the distance but this was much larger and had no flashing lights.It almost did not appear to be a solid object it looked like a strong light mist and it floated directly over us and what appeared a few miles to the east then turned sharply to the south and out of site.                                                                                     I, did not think anything of it,until we saw it return from the south and head north at a faster rate.Its movments were usually straight but when it changed directions,it just turned sharp but smooth.  No swooping turn like a jet.;40.0171;-81.0761
