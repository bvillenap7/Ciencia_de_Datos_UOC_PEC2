I was sitting in a tree stand, bowhunting for deer.  It was still completely dark.  The tree stand was approximately 50 yards from a cornfield.  The whole field was suddenly completely illuminated.  I then saw 2 small lights moving across the north side of the cornfield.  After 2 to 3 minutes they came back across the field and disappeared.  The field continued to be lit up for several more minutes.  Then the light went out and it was completely dark again.  At no time did I hear any type of sound and at no time did the light move.;40.0035000000001;-82.6726000000005
Multiple objects appeared from dark sky and tracked behind each other.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-24 05:30:00;15 minutes;Looking east about 45 degree from horizon.  Multiple objects appeared from dark sky and tracked behind each other and then disappeared. They just appeared in a part of the sky and followed each other.  No sounds, no flashing lights. Looked similar to what the Space Station looks like but there were many of them and followed each other.  These were not shooting stars.;40.0035000000001;-82.6726000000005
