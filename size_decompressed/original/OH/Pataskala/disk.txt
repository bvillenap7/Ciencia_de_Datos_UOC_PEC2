In the distance the object resembled a saucer that was green with a sliver of red to it.   As the object got closer the green started to fade away into a platinum color.   When the object got directly over my bedroom I could make out six red lights on the bottom of it in a . .  (hexagon) pattern.  I could clearly see the object though. .   . . .;40.0035000000001;-82.6726000000005
UFO observed in the daytime sky by two individuals.;2015-09-24 17:30:00;4-6 minutes;UFO observed in the daytime sky by two individuals. A repair man just completed work outside, on the AC compressor unit. I was engaged in a conversation with him, as I stood on my deck.  The repairman was standing on the ground looking up and facing to the West.  In the middle of the conversation. The repairman said to me,  Do you see that ?  I glared up to the West but, only saw an airplane in the sky.  The airplane was leaving an exhaust trail in the sky. The repair man then said to me,  That is weird it's gone.  I then walked to the corner of my deck and looked up and to the West. The disc object appeared again out of thin air.  At what I would compare to be a very high altitude. In reference, their was an airplane in the sky. The UFO appeared well above that airplane and just off to the right side, of the setting sun. The object appeared to be a flat disc shaped object.  The UFO gleamed with bright light.  From what I would assume was from the glare of the sun onto the metal of the object?  We believe it to be a UFO.  Due to the fact that the airplanes that flew over head, left exhaust trails in the sky.  Their was no exhaust trail associated with this object.  The sky was blue with no cloud cover near, or around the object.  The object then appeared again, out of thin air.  The UFO sat in the sky for a few minutes.  The object then disappeared for a final time.  The UFO  was not seen again.  However, we were left stunned and shocked out of what we just witnessed.;40.0035000000001;-82.6726000000005
