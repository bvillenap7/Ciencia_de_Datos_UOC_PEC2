Bright objects hovering in the sky that changed shape and flashed multiple colors.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2015-09-18 04:45:00;still going on;Bright objects hovering in the sky that changed shape and flashed multiple colors, event still happening as I type this. I noticed around 4:45am a bright light hovering outside my bedroom window.  It is high up in the sky.  I noticed two other light things forming a triangle pattern in the sky with the one bright object.  The other two were higher up and were flashing different colors of green, blue, red, and orange.   I went outside on the back porch to make sure I was seeing what I was seeing.  I then got my husband who was in the garage and made him go out back with me, so that I had someone else witnessing this with me, so I knew I wasn't seeing things.  He went inside and got me a pair of binoculars and we looked at the objects thru them.  The brightest one also had other colors in it, and the object kept changing shape.  I even had him get on his phone and ask siri what planes were flying over head, which there was an american airlines flight and fedex planes that were flying over head at the time as well as some company with the name of mission in the title.  Some of the! planes went right by the objects, but dropped or raised altitude when going by them.   This isn't the first time I have seen something odd like this.  It is 6:07 am and they are still outside hovering.  Also over the course of the event, the stars have shifted positions in the sky and the sun is now coming up, but the only object remaining is the brightest one now.   Also it has not shifted its position.  My husband has taken a video with his iphone.  once we figure out how to get it onto my computer, I will email it or put it on a disk and mail it to you.  Also I live just outside Pataskala, Ohio, in a little town called Outville.;40.0035000000001;-82.6726000000005
