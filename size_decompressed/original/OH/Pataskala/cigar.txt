Silver object seen by 2 witnesses.;2016-04-16 17:00:00;2 minutes;Silver object seen by 2 witnesses My boyfriend and I were driving westbound on I-70 towards Columbus, near Pataskala, when I noticed a shiny object in the sky to our right.   At first I thought it was an airplane but on second look I saw that it was larger and fatter than an airplane.  It was oblong cigar-shaped, very shiny like the Sun reflecting on silver metal.  It was sort of hanging in the sky at a slight angle.   I pointed at it, and my boyfriend said he saw it too.  When I looked back it was gone.  The sky was clear blue with no clouds.  We did see an airplane very high in the sky leaving a Chemtrail.  The object appeared again, and then disappeared completely.;40.0035000000001;-82.6726000000005
