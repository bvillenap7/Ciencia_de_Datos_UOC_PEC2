Triangle-shaped craft hoverig low over a house in Pataskala Ohio;2007-12-23 23:00:00;1 minute;Triangle-shaped craft hoverig low over a house in Pataskala Ohio My  brother and I were driving home from our friends house around 11:00 at night and we glanced off to our left and saw a small group of lights.   At first we thought nothing of it we just assumed it was a commercial jet on its way to Columbus airport which is close by.  However as we got closer to the object it became apparent that the object was close and was not moving.   I slowed my car down and tried to get a good look at it I saw that the object was hovering about 100-150 ft. above a nearby house and not moving.   The craft was triangle shaped and had a white light on each corner and a red light somewhere near the middle.  It was a full moon so I was easily able to see the shape of the craft against the sky, the craft was not white like a commercial jet, it was either gray or black, the only way I was easily able to distinguish its shape was by observing it against the moonlight sky.   It was difficult to tell how tall the craft was because I was observing it mostly from the bottom so the craft could have been pyramidal.   I slowly passed the house the craft was hovering over and immediately turned around once I realized what I was looking at.  When I was about half way back to the house the craft started slowly flying away to the south-east.   As I was drawing nearer to the craft it tilted to the right and gained speed and headed off towards Columbus (to the south-east).    As I mentioned earlier it was a full moon out and there were a few clouds in the sky that were white because they were being illuminated by the moon, I believe this is the only reason I was able to distinguish the craft's shape.;40.0035000000001;-82.6726000000005
Triangle UFO near Columbus;2013-07-06 21:55:00;1-5 minutes;Triangle UFO near Columbus I was with my girlfriend driving on the country roads when I noticed three orange lights in the distance forming a triangle.   I pointed it out to her and she saw it as well.  I saw a fourth light appear in the center of the three and the lights moved together like they were the points of a craft.   This made me believe that they were not flares.   I was unable to capture video because trees began to block our view as we approached her house.   We drove back out a couple minutes later to see if it was still there but could see nothing except several helicopters flying around in all directions.  This was the most unusual aspect of the whole scenario to us. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.0035000000001;-82.6726000000005
Low flying silent black triangle.;2017-09-28 21:00:00;6 seconds;low flying silent black triangle. I was on the back porch having a cigarette and looking up at the clear night sky, when a silhouette of a triangle flew overhead.  It was fairly low running north to south and silent.  Its color seemed to match the background of the night sky, and there was an un-lit ring on the bottom of each corner;40.0035000000001;-82.6726000000005
