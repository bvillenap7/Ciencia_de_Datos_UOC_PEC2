Spheres flying in formation, that faded out to nothing.;2012-12-22 21:45:00;5 minutes;Spheres flying in formation, that faded out to nothing. I am not sure what it was that we saw, but at 9:45pm est, I went outside to let the dog go potty.  While I was outside, I saw these sphere shapes flying slowly in the sky, they were orange/red in color, like fire.  There were no noise emanating from them, and as they flew across the sky they faded out to nothing one by one.  When I first saw them I ran inside to get my mother in law and daughter, and they came outside to see them with me.  I even called my fiance to tell him about it.   I have written down the pattern that I saw them fly in.  Toward the end of the 14 spheres flying, I noticed one of them did pass another one and then faded out.  That was the only one I saw fly past one.  The rest stayed in formation.  We also got a small video of a few of them, but the video is not so good.  They look like little white spheres on the video because it was at night and there was not much light out.  There was also an aircraft that was heading towards Columbus, that flew right by them.  I don't know what we saw, and can not explain it. Thank you for your time. My mother in law also called the hotline.;40.0035000000001;-82.6726000000005

They were moving way to fast to be planes and seemed to be trying to jockey into predetermined positions.  At the last second they suddenly all merged towards each other at an even faster pace and then disappeared like they shot through some sort of space tunnel or portal.;40.0035000000001;-82.6726000000005
