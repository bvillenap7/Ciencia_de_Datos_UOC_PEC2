large,flat square object that didnt seem to move much;2000-11-10 18:00:00;1 minute;large,flat square object that didnt seem to move much I was on my way to my grandmothers house on a friday evening. I was nothbound on I75about a mile off the buck road onramp when I looked to the western sky I seen a large black square or rectangle in the sky. I slowed down as muh as I could to keep inveiw,but the traffic kept me going at a speed of 65mph and that put me in line with bridges and buildings that blocked my veiw. There was an airplane near it and at first I thought it might be a very large tarp of some sort being pulled by the plane but the plane was turning and doing a few maneauvers it seemed to get a better look and the object didnt move when the plane did so I figured it wasnt really attached in any way. The object made the plane look like an ant in size, so Iknow it was very big. It did seem to tilt or turn at one moment and it was very thin then went back to the veiw that made it look square. I seen a program on the discovery channel that had an object that looked pretty much identicle to it a couple weeks ago.;41.5399004739335;-83.589608530806
