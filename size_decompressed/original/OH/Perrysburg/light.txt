UFO spotted following planes.;2010-10-22 18:47:00;30 Seconds;UFO spotted following planes. I stepped out of my car at approximately 18:47 on 10-22-10 and looked up to a clear sky with the sun just setting on the horizon. I look up to see several airplanes leaving an exhaust trail as they fly through the air.   As two planes going opposite directions came closer to each other before passing one another an bright object appeared in the sky. after the planes passed each other the UFO proceeded to follow one of the planes. It followed for about 10 seconds stopped then slowly got dimmer until it disappeared.  This UFO was not another plane because it did not have an exhaust trail like all the other planes in the sky and also was able to stop and accelerate again, and did so two times.;41.5399004739335;-83.589608530806
