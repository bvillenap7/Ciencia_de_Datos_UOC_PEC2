Piggyback Jets?;2002-05-30 18:40:00;2 Minutes;Piggyback Jets? In a perfectly clear blue daylight sky we spotted two aircraft at 70 degrees from our position which appeared to be flying in unison south to north at very close proximity (within 50 feet of each other). They appeared to be flying at approx. 7-10,000 feet and rising at a steady rate. The larger aircraft looked to be the size and shape of a Boeing 747 (not military). The smaller aircraft which was just above and slightly forward of the larger (jet?) had the same approx. shape but was smaller by about 50%. We watched them cross the sky together, so we know it wasn't the case of two jets with one more distant on the same trajectory. What was unusual besides their close proximity, was that both objects were all white with no apparent markings, no sound (if they were regular jets we definately should have heard something) and no exhaust trails! It was quite a site. Very strange....;41.5399004739335;-83.589608530806
Chinese Lantern Shaped Glowing Orange Ball;2011-11-01 02:17:00;3 minutes;Chinese Lantern Shaped Glowing Orange Ball On November, 2011 at approximately 2:30 am, I witnessed a UFO sighting.  It was a cool night and clear sky.  I was on my way home to Michigan from Cincinnati, Ohio.  I was driving down I-75 N when I noticed it. It was above an open field between Bowling Green, Ohio and Perrysburg.  It appeared to be a Chinese lantern that was glowing a bright orange color.   I slowed down and watched it for a few minutes and it was moving at a very slow pace.  There was also a Semi truck next to me that was watching it also.  It then disappeared.
