I had just left the town of Perrysburg heading east on Rte. 795 when I happened to glance up at the sky, as it was a full moon out and a storm had just passed. I was checking to see if there were any more dark clouds when all of a sudden, off in the direction of the northeast, I saw what I originally thought was a cluster of three stars, placed close together in a straight line. This had piqued my curiosity because I had never seen anything like that before. I continued to drive, periodically glancing up at the sky and noticing that the object did not move. It remained in my field of vision for about 6 miles until I turned off the highway onto an exit ramp. I continued to look at the object through the rearview mirror as I was now heading south down a country road. As I pulled into the subdivision that I lived in, I happened to look back to the northeast- but instead of the three star-like objects, there appeared a large object, shaped almost like a blimp, with five or six white lights making the outline of the object and three red lights in the center of the white ones. I followed the object as it moved east to west at what I would guess to say would be about 50 miles per hour had it been traveling on the ground. I lost sight of the object as it passed over the nearby train yard on the other side of the road, as my view of the sky to the west is obscured by the trains and a grove of trees nearby.;41.5399004739335;-83.589608530806
