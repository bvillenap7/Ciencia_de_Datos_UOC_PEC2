At approximately 11 pm, a friend and I were out on the front porch looking at fireworks being set off around us.   I looked up to see a red, orange, large, round ball of light immerge from the tree line upwards.  It rose from the east traveling in a fast, steady speed into the distant west.  It traveled west for about 30 seconds before quickly fading into nothingness.   15 seconds after the first disappeared, another rose from the exact same area and traveled in the exact same manner as the first, this time taking a longer time to fade away.   We attemped to take pictures, but every time a picture was taken the object would move a certain way and render the picture nearly useless. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnessed might have observed so-called Chinese lanterns, launched from a social gathering.  PD));41.5399004739335;-83.589608530806
