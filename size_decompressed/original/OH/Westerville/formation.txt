He noted that several onlookers were pointing to the sky. Upon looking where these people were pointing we both noticed 3 orange orbs in a triangle formation.  They appeared to be over the water and were quite high up.  They only stayed this way for a minute or so. By the time we had pulled over to watch them they all had taken off in very different directions at a high rate of speed. At one point one of the craft headed over the vehicle we were in. It was quite high up, as we lost sight of it when it disappeared into the clouds.  One thing which stood out to me the most was that the object's orange glow was not a light, but the vehicle itself.  It also did not make any sound.;40.1199038732396;-82.9018682218326
20-30 lights moving in a straight line over Westerville, Ohio.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-25 05:50:00;5-10 minutes;20-30 lights moving in a straight line over Westerville, Ohio Approximately 5:50 a.m. I saw a string of lights moving in a straight line to the northeast over Westerville, Ohio, not far from Johnstown. My first sighting was a pair of lights in close formation moving at a pace consistent with a high-flying aircraft. The lights were white and steady. A third light appeared approximately 5-10 degrees behind the initial pair, moving at the same rate and in the same direction. For the next ten minutes, lights appeared in the same spot in the sky, at a point midway between the Big Dipper and the pole star. Most of the lights were in the same straight line, evenly spaced, but occasionally another pair would appear instead of a single light. This continued for a total of 5 to 10 minutes, ending shortly before 6 a.m. I didn't count the lights, but there were at least 20 and perhaps as many as 30. At the same time I saw other aircraft in the sky, in different locations, all blinking lights, from which I heard engine sound, but t! he string of lights moving to the northeast were silent.;40.1199038732396;-82.9018682218326
