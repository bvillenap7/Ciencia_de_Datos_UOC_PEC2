it was a white blueish fireball,leaving a greenish,long trail of orange sparks;1999-11-16 19:02:00;7to10 seconds;it was a white blueish fireball,leaving a greenish,long trail of orange sparks I was leaving the westerville mall(a suburb of columbus ohio,to the n.e.) @ 7:02p.m.driving west when the object came into view.It moved s.w. to n.e.(but almost due east),it was very large,as it appeared to be above 10000 feet.It was a brilliant white with a blueish hue towards the rear of it,streaming to a greenish tail.It left behind a very long tail of sparks(orange in color).The object was in view for approximately 7 seconds before disappearing over the horizon.When it was directly over head,the object broke into 5 or so piece's,that remained the brilliant white until it was out of view.The weird thing was,the objects stayed in formation,just dropped back and then followed in a train like fashion.The object seemed to be about one third the size of a full moon. I am 35 years old,I am a professional truck driver.I have listened to the reports given on the Art Bell show,so I was ready to take down the pertinent information and make a report. My passenger is a 45 y/o female office manager. I hope this is useful.;40.1199038732396;-82.9018682218326
