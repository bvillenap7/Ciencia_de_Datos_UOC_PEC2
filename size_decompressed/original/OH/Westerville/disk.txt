3 Flying Saucers with eerie purple lights flew high across sky;2005-11-28 23:30:00;15 seconds;3 Flying Saucers with eerie purple lights flew high across sky I was driving on the town at about 11:30 pm, when I happened to look up when i was stopped at a stop light, at state & schrock. In the clear sky i made out 3 ufos that looked like flying saucers zoom across the sky. I alerted my three companions in the car and they saw them too. also, there was some sort of eerie purple light coming off of then. the whole incident lasted only about 15 seconds, if i wouldn't have looked up, i wouldn't have seen them.;40.1199038732396;-82.9018682218326
