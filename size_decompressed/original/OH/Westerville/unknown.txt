UFO over Westerville, Ohio?;2003-10-15 18:00:00;40 minutes;UFO over Westerville, Ohio? My wife and I were sitting on our screened-in porch at our home in Westerville, Ohio, which faces east.   At around 6:00 pm on an October evening, we saw a large bright stationary object in the southeast sky.  I tended to ignore it for awhile.  I thought that perhaps it was a communications satellite.   I went into the house and got by 7 x 50 field glasses to help identify the object.  It was no helicopter, commerical or military aircraft, and certainly not one of those blimps that occasionally make its way down to the Ohio State University to cover a football game.  As far as I could tell, it didn't move.  There was no noise coming from it.  The object was perhaps 50 to 60 feet in diameter.   The setting sun was reflecting off the object and made it somewhat difficult to see.  As far as I could tell, there were no external lights.  There were 5 large rectangular windows that took up much of the space of this object.  There was a yellow glow in the interior.   I saw a person dressed in a light-colored single piece suit from the neck down.  The person had a head, 2 arms, and a body.  He appeared to move only once and only slightly.  It stood next to what appeared to be a file cabinet, which stood as tall as his shoulder.  There was some mass around these windows but nothing that would constitute the body of some aircraft. The next evening, my wife and I saw the same object.  I called a local television station to report what I had seen and if anybody had any idea what it was.  The lady gave me some answer and that was the last that I heard of this object.   As far as I know, nothing was reported on any television news broadcast or, printed in the Columbus Dispatch.   Surely, others in the area must have seen this object.  I know what I saw, but I have no idea what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

pulsing object seen extremely high in the noon sky...;2020-08-08 12:45:00;20 minutes;pulsing object seen extremely high in the noon sky... I observed an object extremely high in the sky that was not moving, seemingly, for several moments at a time.  When it did move, it only moved incrementally from left to right, or down.  The day of observation was unlimited visibility, with clear, blue sky and puffy white clouds. The object appeared to be the size of a star, tiny as in the eye of a needle.  It reflected the sun from time to time, and pulsed when it caught the sun's rays, then dimmed again.  his dimness or brightness may  have occurred when the object turned or rotated.  The object appeared about 60-70 degrees above the north's vertical horizon.  It was so distant that the shape of the object could not be determined...however, it was not a plane, and I base that conclusion on the fact that it appeared over a 20 minute time period to have moved only slightly right, left, or down. This is my first ever observation, I am 81 years of age, with three college degrees, including a Ph.D.;40.1199038732396;-82.9018682218326
