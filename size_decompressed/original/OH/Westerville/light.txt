Westerville OH September 23 2002 UFO Sighting;2002-09-23 22:30:00;3 seconds;Westerville OH September 23 2002 UFO Sighting I was driving northwest on a non-lighted country road.  In the sky at about 75 degrees in the northwest sky, an oval light appeared (about half the size of the full moon).  It moved west to north for about 2 seconds after it appeared and shot across the sky. The brightness of the light compared to the full moon.  Too fast to be a plane, it disappeared as fast as it appeared.  Even with the brightness of the full moon, it vanished into the darkness.  It left no streak in the sky.  It happened so quickly, but I will never forget the intensity.  This is the first time I have ever experienced this type of phenomomen.  This occured in Westerville OH, a suburb of Columbus Ohio USA;40.1199038732396;-82.9018682218326
