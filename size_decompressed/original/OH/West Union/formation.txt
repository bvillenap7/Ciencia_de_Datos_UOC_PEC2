I just got home from work and was walking our dog when I first noticed the 4 lights in a perfect horizontal formation.  The 4 orangeish lights were spaced apart perfectly.  The lights were tracing each other.  Meaning the first light on the left would come on then go off and the second would come on and so on until it got to the last light and the pattern would start again.  It did this tracing for about 2 minutes.  After those 2 minutes it went to only a single light that would pulse on and off (I was able to capture this on my phone). This only lasted maybe a minute.  Then it was completely gone. No more lights to be seen. The lights appeared to be less than 5 miles away and there weren't any audible noises you would expect a flying craft to make.;38.7989;-83.5317
