Silent orange glowing harvest moon-like ball sitting behind a treeline.;2009-06-17 22:00:00;5 minutes;Silent orange glowing &quotharvest moon-like&quot ball sitting behind a treeline I lived on a farm surrounded by woods with other farm properties and houses within sight. One night I stepped out onto my back porch to take a break from watching a TV program and casually looked out across the back field to an Amish farm about 1/10 of a mile down  a slope from where I lived. Behind their house was a pasture with some trees to the rear of the fence line. Behind these trees I saw a glowing orange yellow ball that looked like a harvest moon, except that it was behind the trees and the tree’s silhouette could be seen in front of the orange “moon- like” shape. I kept looking at this, trying to comprehend what I was seeing and how this might be happening. It made no sense in my mind. I was wearing glasses and thought maybe this was some sort of light being reflected off of my lenses and that I was mistaken in what I was seeing. I took off my glasses and the orange ball/circle was still there. I turned  around into the back screen door to call out my partner to come and see this and turned away for only a moment. When I looked back it was gone! No noise at all. It was just no longer sitting behind the trees there. I have never seen anything like this before or since.;38.7989;-83.5317

It was very bright, circular,and moved quickly.  It stopped then moved quickly in a 90 degree angle.   I was facing south looking straight up.  It was yellowish in color and looked to be higher up than a jet would fly.;38.7989;-83.5317
