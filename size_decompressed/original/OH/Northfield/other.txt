I had to turn around a few times to try and keep a visual on the craft because the trees blocked me from seeing it when it moved.  It was really low.  Noiseless.   It had a very bright white light in the center that appeared to be perfectly round.  It looked rectangular with lights on each end that seemed duller than the center, but also bright.  I really can't say what color the end lights were because the center light was so dominant.   Because I couldn't identify it, I thought maybe it was a drone.  I've never really seen a drone in person but I was trying to make some kind of identification.   After 15 minutes of following the craft, I decided that I needed to get home.  But as I started to head home, I noticed another car stopped in the middle of the street.  I thought oh gosh, it's the cops and they must have seen me driving crazy trying to follow this thing but it wasn't.  I assumed it was someone else who was watching this low flying craft that was barely moving.   I took two pics out of my car window.  Best I could get.  I'm surprised that all u captured were lights that looked farther away than they were.  I won't speculate as to what it was because I really don't know.
