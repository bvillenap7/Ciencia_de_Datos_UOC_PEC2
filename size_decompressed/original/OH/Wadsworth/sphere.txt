As I was getting into my Chevy Cavalier I saw this flat black bowling ball shaped thing with a ring around it, attached to the sphere with three struts, equally spaced.   At first, I immediately thought it was one of our local hot air balloons from the local airport.  But no, this thing made no noise, reflected no sunlight, and was travelling West to East.   I watched it through the sunroof for 30 seconds, and lost it when it went behind a tree.  I tried to follow it, but I never caught up with it.  I would like to know if anybody else saw this that day (or week) in my local area.  It was the size of a penny at an arm's length, and very high up there.  It was the most flat black thing I have EVER seen (no reflections whatsoever). My name is((Name deleted)). I now live in Rittman, Ohio.;41.039;-81.7381000000001
