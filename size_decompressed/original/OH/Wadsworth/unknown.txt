I then saw something just hovering there and quickly sped away north east a few seconds after looking at it.  When I saw it, it looked to be a square or triangle.  It also had lights in the middle either in the shape of half a triangle (angle facing me) but could've also been half circle.  The UFO was black or dark blue.   I then ran inside, dropping my bike and yelling curses at my family about what I just saw.  I then googled the hotline and talked to a man who rushed me and kept asking if this was a prank.  It's not.  My mom and older friends claim to have seen these all around Ohio, always flying northeast when spotted.   After I hung up, I heard a thunderous sound that lasted about two seconds.  It almost sounded like an echoing whip snap sound.   And now I'm here watching my cats stare at the sky with wide eyes.;41.039;-81.7381000000001
