Six Star like objects in tight formation moving at a high rate of speed;2001-02-26 20:30:00;5 to 7 sec.;Six Star like objects in tight formation moving at a high rate of speed I was looking up at the night sky outside my garage. There were clouds to the north and south, but above me it was very clear. I first thought I saw a shooting star emerging from the cloud cover to the north. As I watched it I could clearly make out 6 definite white lights fly in close formation. They did not keep perfect formation at one point. It looked like the three on the right swirved slightley toward the three on the left and then went back in formation as they disapeared into the clouds to the south. They were visible for a long distance but moved so fast and silent, they were gone in about 5 to 7 seconds. It looked as though they banked to the west as they disapeared into the clouds. I saw no colored lights. I saw nothing in front or behind the objects. I also saw no vapor trail and heard nothing.;41.039;-81.7381000000001
