Squadrons flying in formation and not in formation, all flying north, for 2 hours.;2013-11-13 13:30:00;2 hours;Squadrons flying in formation and not in formation, all flying north, for 2 hours. For the span of two hours we observed several (20+) unidentified aircraft, that looked nothing like all the other planes flying around them, fly from the east, to the north and northwest.   They were faster than the other aircraft too, and there were no visible wings and no engine sound.  We also have photos.   One of the aircraft flew back form the west towards the east, and looked like it changed to a red color.;41.039;-81.7381000000001
