Stargazing several miles west of Wadsworth, OH. I've read and heard about sightings for years, and now, a first for me, I can't say it was an 'IFO', so that leaves this as a 'UFO' for me. I was stargazing with my friend, early Wednesday morning, Sep 1st. At one point while I was walking from my car to the telescope, I noticed low, in the eastern horizon, a rather large bright orange ball of light (like a street lamp in color). At first, I thought it might be an airplane or helicopter 'headlight'. But orange?  Quickly, I grabbed and aimed the telescope at the object, which appeared not to be moving. Looking into the eyepiece revealed 2 orange balls of light, one slightly larger than the other. Then all of a sudden, while I'm looking at these lights through the telescope, they 'turn off'!  It's gone.  There's nothing there.  If it was an airplane or helicopter, where are the other 'marking' or tail lights? While my friend thinks it may have been an airplane or helicopter, he couldn't say what it was. Did anyone else see this around here?;41.039;-81.7381000000001
I winessed a light traveling from east to west in the lower southern sky of N. E. Ohio;2008-10-17 23:15:00;05 minutes;I winessed a light traveling from east to west in the lower southern sky of N. E. Ohio On Friday evening October 17th 2008 while sitting in my backyard hot tub I witnessed a light in the south east sky.  For the first minute I could not determine if it was actually moving toward the south west or if it was just a star.  After a couple of minutes it became much more visually obvious that it was moving.  Within about three minutes it was obviously moving due west across the southern sky and was not blinking, changing size or brightness.  I grabbed my binoculars to get a better view but they did not make much difference in seeing what still looked like a star. I visually followed the object until it was directly south of me and was either behind some trees or no longer visible.  This sighting lasted at least five and no longer than ten minutes.;41.039;-81.7381000000001
