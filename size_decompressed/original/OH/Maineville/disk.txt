At a bonfire (church) around 7:00 pm we witnessed multiple white objects appearing and disappearing in the sky to the northwest....at first there were 3 then 1 seemed to disappear and then over the course of about 30 minutes the objects changed in number (never disappearing completely)...and no more than 5 that were visible...one of the parents told the children they were sundogs after the kids began calling them ufo’s....I wanted to video but parents wanted to distract their children...these objects were in the wrong location for a sundog..,they were not meteorites or shooting stars....don’t know what they were just thought I’d share ...surely someone else must have witnessed what we all saw...I am including pictures...you’ll have to zoom to see objects and one picture has a football in it to the right (kids playing catch)...;39.3179;-84.2482999999998
