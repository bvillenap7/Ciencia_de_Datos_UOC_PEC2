Silver Cylinder Shape with verticle rings around  - mostly likely normally transparent;2012-09-20 10:00:00;3 seconds;Silver Cylinder Shape with verticle rings around  - mostly likely normally transparent This morning, September 20, 2012, I went on my patio to smoke a cigarette. I work from home and was taking a quick break.  While standing there I glimpsed a horizontal cylinder shape, silver, with 2-3 slender rings (attached) going around the cylinder shape (vertically) in sections. It was just a very quick glimpse and when I looked away and back again it was no longer there. There were no lights and it was so odd that it was just hovering there like a hummingbird.  It was pretty close, not at all as far as a plane but not real close, certainly in the sky.  Again, it was so fast and sort of like something you shouldn’t have noticed but it was or IS always there. I more or less blew this off as a possible mind trick or something.  I tend to be pretty practical and will rationalize anything. However, when I told my husband about it tonight when he came home from work, he really got excited about it. Now, the thing I dismissed as a mind trick became interesting.  I didn’t immediately think ‘UFO’ but more like a ‘Drone’.  I decided then to google images of ‘silver cylinders in the sky’ – no luck. Nothing came up like what I saw.  I then googled using a regular search.  Imagine my surprise when this site comes up with multiple sightings similar to my own!!  So…I had to share my experience, just in case, especially since there was a sighting close to my own a little over a month ago.;39.3179;-84.2482999999998
