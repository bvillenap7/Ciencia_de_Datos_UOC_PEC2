Black round craft, going from south to north, almost parallel with interstate I-71;2012-03-12 14:30:00;20 seconds;a black round craft, going from south to north, almost parallel with interstate I-71 The craft was going from South to North below the cloud level, it was rainy that day.  It was round, black and not very large maybe 6-10 feet in circumference, it was approximately 2-3 thousand feet up(just a guess) but below cloud level and going at significant speed.  Just before it disappeared into the clouds I saw a glimmer or a light come through it but it was not airplane lights.  I am absolutely sure of that.   My initial thought was the sun hit it but that would have been impossible because of the heavy cloud cover that day.  The whole event took approximately 20 seconds before it disappeared.  I am sure that it was not an airplane (no wings) nor was it a helicopter or a bird.   Also there was no sound.  It was within a half a mile from where I was standing.  I ran to get a better look because of the trees but it disappeared into the clouds.;39.3179;-84.2482999999998
