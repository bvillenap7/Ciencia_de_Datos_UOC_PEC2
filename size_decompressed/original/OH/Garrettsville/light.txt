Light next to house and out above treeline.;2004-03-01 21:30:00;15 minutes;Light next to house and out above treeline. I was sitting in my kitchen and I noticed a light at the end of my driveway (not a car light,vertical), then my dog started barking violently as if someone was not welcome, then I looked out the window and it was right next to the house and the light was beating straight onto the ground, I ran grabbed a knife and went outside with my younger brother, the light was gone, so we came back inside, we looked out the window and above the treeline behind my house we saw a bright orangish light that got brighter and dimmed, it moved but only slightly, it changed colors from orange to blue then to white, and did this over and over again, this continued for like ten more minutes then it simply dissappeared, I had the rest of my family look at it before it was gone and they couldn't determine what it was, but I knew. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been observing a celestial body, perhaps Sirius.  PD));41.2914;-81.0655000000001
