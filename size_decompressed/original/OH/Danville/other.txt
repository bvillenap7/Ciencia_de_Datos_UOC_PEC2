3 solid lights small dull (like tiny stars) perfectly spaced moving very fast.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space X SpaceLink satellites? PD));2019-05-26 23:46:00;15 seconds;3 solid lights small dull ( like tinny stars ) perfectly spaced moving very fast silently 3 lights in perfectly straight line, dull like background stars (not very bright), flew past us, first guess was planes in formation or 3 satellites, but the lights were dull not blinking (solid) the dots were small and length from one end to the other appeared to us as massive.  This did not appear to be close to us but very high in the sky.  No clouds in the section it flew over as we were looking right at the big dipper and other stars.  I started to run in its departing direction to take a picture.  My camera took a front facing shot of my shirt while I was running at it.  I got the time and geo tag, but no picture of it before it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Space X Space Link satellites? PD));40.4583;-82.2677
