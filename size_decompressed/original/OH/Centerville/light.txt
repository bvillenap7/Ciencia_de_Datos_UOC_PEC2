Bright flashing light in an orangish color from the sky.;1998-07-12 02:50:00;1 minute;Bright flashing light in an orangish color from the sky. This past Saturday a friend was staying over at my house and around 2:45-2:50 a.m.  we were laying in bed just talking about the evening we just had.  We then noticed that a light ( like a cop siren light) was flashing throught the window.  We looked outside saw no cop car, or even an ambulance.  What we did see however was a circular light in an orangish color pulsing.  It was like several strong and bright orange colored flashlights being directed at the ground.  I have no idea how large the circle was because I didn't go outside to see it.  As abruptly as it had started it was gone.  The total duration of the light from the time we first noticed it to the time it vanished was approximatly 1:30, to 2 minutes.  Also my friend says that the light was also blueish to her.  I would have to agree with this, but due to my fright I am not going to say for sure.;39.6438000000004;-84.1742999999992
Bright green light with small red and white flashing lights hovering in one spot.;2014-11-28 04:00:00;2 minutes;Bright green light with small red and white flashing lights hovering in one spot. I looked up and through the trees saw a bright green light which is why I stared at it in the first place then it appeared to be moving in the sky then I saw smaller red and white flashing lights but then it turned and again saw only the bright green light.   I could not make out the aircraft's shape but I felt fear and just ran to my car and drove away quickly as this was not the first time I've seen something in the sky and it scares me.   About 15 years ago in Dayton, Ohio, I saw an actual UFO outside my window, hovering pretty low in the sky and when I tried to make my boyfriend look up to see it too it flew across the sky and disappeared, so I now fear seeing this and don't want whatever is flying these things if alien to know I've seen them!;39.6438000000004;-84.1742999999992
2 high intensity flashes of light in sky.;2014-12-27 05:30:00;2 seconds;2 high intensity flashes of light in sky Driving north on St. Rt. 725 and seen 2 very bright flashes of light, which seemed to be originating in the dirction of beavercreek.  The best example I can give is to an electrical transformer blowing up (the way it lights the sky), but on a much bigger scale and was two around one to two second flashes.;39.6438000000004;-84.1742999999992
4 white lights seen over Ohio.;2017-05-13 23:00:00;15 minutes;4 white lights seen over Ohio On 13 May, at approximately 11pm, I was sitting on my back porch looking at wildlife with my night vision monocle (model AN/PVS-14).  I decided to look up and see the stars that arenâ€™t normally visible to the naked eye due to light pollution, and while I was looking up (almost due east), I saw what appeared to be a faint satellite moving towards the north west, approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.   I decided to watch the satellite as it traversed the sky, and as I tracked it, it changed heading towards the south west for approximately 5 seconds, then turned again towards its original heading.  This object was not visible to the naked eye, requiring my night vision to see.  There was no flashing just a faint, steady pinpoint of light.  I called a friend immediately afterwards to describe what I saw, and while I was on the phone (approximately 5 minutes later), I saw two more of the faint points of light moving on the same trajectory.    15 minutes later, I saw a 4th point of light moving the same direction.  Of the 4 objects I saw, only one changed heading while traversing the sky, the other 3 were constant.;39.6438000000004;-84.1742999999992
