Very large silent craft with 4 lights moving slowly across the sky;2009-10-29 20:15:00;2 minutes;Very large silent craft with 4 lights moving slowly across the sky While driving in the car heading north on Rt 48 near 725 my son spotted 4 very bright lights low in the sky.  We thought it was an airplane, possibly one of the C5s from Wright Patterson AFB.  But then we noticed it was too low and too massive to be a plane.  I slowed down the car and we rolled down the windows.  We heard nothing.  It was silent and moved at a slow speed east to west and then turned north and east disappearing behind the trees.;39.6438000000004;-84.1742999999992
