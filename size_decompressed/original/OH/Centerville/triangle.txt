Black Triangle craft with lights on all corners and it made a humming sound;2000-05-01 22:00:00;Few minutes;Black Triangle craft with lights on all corners and it made a humming sound Suburb of Dayton, Ohio.  Very similar story to the report on 07/19/2020 in Dayton, Ohio.  Me, my ex wife, my friend and his ex wife saw a large black triangle craft in the sky.  It had a light on all 3 corners, flying low, making a humming sound.  It was flying from the south west, to the north east, along I-675, heading towards Wright Patterson Air Force Base.  We watched the 11 o'clock news that night, and there were reports of a massive power outage from Germantown, Ohio to Miamisburg, Ohio to Centerville, Ohio to south Kettering, Ohio.  That is the path/direction that the craft was flying from.  Over the last 20 years, I've thought that the humming was the craft drawing out electricity to help keep it flying.  Just a thought of mine.  I also saw something else by Wright Patt that I cannot explain.  After that sighting, fighter jets scrambled from WPAFB.;39.6438000000004;-84.1742999999992
Large Triangle shaped flying object was perfectly stationary then moved in a curve away from us over Centerville, Ohio off 675.;2013-09-18 21:10:00;1-2 minutes;Large Triangle shaped flying object was perfectly stationary then moved in a curve away from us over Centerville, Ohio off 675 My son and I were witnesses to this.  My son is a 15 year old Caucasian male and I am a 42 year Caucasian female.  We were driving home from his volleyball league at night, heading north on route 675 close to mile marker 4 or 5 around Centerville, Ohio.  We saw something that looked like car headlights in the sky about the height of a cell phone tower.  It was up ahead on our left.   As we got closer we noticed it was too large to be a cell tower and we did not see any structure underneath it.  It was definitely stationary - not moving.  As we got up almost even with it, we noticed how large it was and how we couldn't see a structure underneath.  We couldn't see the actual craft, but could now see lights underneath as well - forming a large triangle.  All of a sudden it took off!  We pulled the van off the road, and my son took out his cell phone and tried to get a video as it went parallel to us for a second or two, then veered off perpendicular to our left - ! quickly.  We were stunned.  We wanted to report it right away in case more people saw it.  I think it's important to note that we have lived in the area for more than 13 years.  There is an Air Force base near us.  That being said, we know how planes, helicopters, fighters, bombers, etc. move in the sky - we see them very often.  I have never seen anything move like this object moved.  So unless it is part of some new, experimental military thing, I don't know what it was!  Another note, before this happened I was in the grocery store near where my son was practicing, and things just felt weird.  There was a policeman outside of the grocery as I came in ... not sure why, this is an extremely safe area of town.  Also the people in the store were acting strange - just kind of overly friendly.  I didn't even think about it until after we saw this thing in the sky on the way home.;39.6438000000004;-84.1742999999992
