I felt a butterfly sensation in my chest and then a great sensation of love and joy then 3 hard thumps in my chest.  I felt violated and scared.  When it left, it felt like it had ripped something out of my chest.  I have been unable to sleep since.  I feel that this thing is still with me and watching me.  It has affected my life and hope that someone out there can help me. My step sister and I saw a white circular-shaped glowball at night hovering over the grass in our front yard from my two-story bedroom window.  I said, Oh My God, what the hell is that?. She said, I do not know.  Then, it darted up about 6' in the air.  I said, Oh My God, it can hear us, it can see us!.  My step sister screamed and fell to the floor.  I looked back at her and then back out the window.  It was not there, but then a split second later, it appeared in front of me.  It was about 2-3 feet in diameter.  I looked into it and it went on forever no concrete thing in it.  I then felt a butterfly sensation in my chest and a great sensation of love and joy.  I had never felt anything like that.  Then i felt 3 hard thumps in my chest.  I felt violated and scared, but decided to wave to it and say hi.  As i did, it left and flew across the street over a house top and it felt like it had ripped something out of my chest.  I have been unable to sleep since.  I recalled this event in 1994, and would like to explain it so i can have a deep sleep without being scared.  I feel that this thing is still with me and watching me.  It has affected my life and hope that someone out there can help me.;39.6438000000004;-84.1742999999992
