Orange orbs drift over Centerville.;2013-06-23 00:50:00;10 minutes;Orange orbs drift over Centerville. My dad spends most of his time in the garage and stays in there as late as 4 am. He opened the door and yelled for me to come outside.  He was standing in the driveway and just above the tree line you could see a small, silent, orange orb slowly drifting to the west.   It stopped abruptly and began to fade and then become bright again as if it were pulsating.  Every few seconds it would drop what appeared to be an ember.  Eventually it did not brighten again.   The reason this was so strange was that in March we saw the exact same thing.  There were two of them drifting directly over our street and larger as they couldnâ€™t have been more than 500 feet up.   I saw a video of the exact same thing in Ireland only during the day.   Were they Chinese lanterns or something more? ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the time and date above.  PD));39.6438000000004;-84.1742999999992
75+ red dots  in the sky over Dayton, Ohio;2013-10-25 21:40:00;10 minutes;75+ red dots  in the sky over Dayton, Ohio Me and my fiancee were coming out of Kroger foods(sugar creek twp.) and started walking to the car.  To the north (Dayton, OH and WPAFB) direction, I first noticed the red lights.  My fiancee noticed after I pointed them out.  There were well over 75  red, slow moving somewhat flickering balls moving across the sky.  They were in no real formation however they did not break the formation they were in what was a scattered but still close to each other group.   The sky was very clear but there are plenty of strip malls, hospitals, restaurants etc in the area so only the brightest stars illuminate.   I tried desperately to catch it on a camera phone pic however it was unable to be captured.  I have the pics saved in my phone and will try to find a way to enhance.   This may have nothing to do with the situation but as this went on I made a phone call to report to a family member.  The phone I was using started to click (a noise it has NEVER done before) while I was on the phone and the objects were still in view.  It has not done that since I left the parking lot.;39.6438000000004;-84.1742999999992
