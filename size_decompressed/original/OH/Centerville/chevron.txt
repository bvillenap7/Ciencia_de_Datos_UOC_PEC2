Very LargeSilent Dark Aircraft;2003-09-26 00:30:00;1 minute;Very LargeSilent Dark Aircraft Very large craft flying or gliding between 1-2000 feet. No lights and no sound what so ever. Observed slightly after Midnight. Clear sky no moon. Looked like a wing shaped cloud from a distance. Then looked like a large eagle. But as it flew directly over I could see it was some kind of craft with large, wide wings. Saw thru binoculars the rear of craft. Had a network of faint tubular supports. It was huge and kind of scary. Travelled at a slow but steady speed. Reminded me of a glider, the way it flew travelling N to S.  I'm an amateur astronomer and have never seen anything like it before.;39.6438000000004;-84.1742999999992
