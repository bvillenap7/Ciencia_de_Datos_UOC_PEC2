soft-white glowball;1973-10-24 18:45:00;45 min;soft-white glowball My stepsister and I were looking out my bedroom window on the second story.  I saw a soft white glowball gliding at about a foot above the ground moving through our yard.  I said, Oh my God, do you see that?  She said yes.  It raised up about 6 feet above ground. I said, Oh my God, it can see us, it can hear us....it is coming over here.  My stepsister screamed and fell to the bedroom floor.  I looked back at her and then back at the window.  I saw nothing in the yard, but then this soft whitish glowball crept up from the window below to show itself right in front of me in the window.  I looked into it trying to fixate on something concrete but could not..it was like looking into an endless thing.  Next, I felt this temendous feeling of joy, euphoria of love...nothing I have ever experience in this life.  Then, a butterfly fluttering in my chest.  I became uncertain and then I felt three thumps in my chest.  Each stronger than the one before.  I decided then to say hi and wave to it.  It ripped out of my body making me feel like it took something from me. The glowball flew across the street over a house.  My senses for the next few weeks were heightened.  I have not slept well since this happened.  I have had a glowball light enter my dreams only a few times during the course of the last 31 years.  On 10/3/04 it happened and I was slightly asleep, more awake than not.  3:00 am, and it came in a small dream.  My body levitated up to it, I stopped breathing for 10 seconds and returned to my body.  I saw a light when my eyes were closed in the dark, like I had been looking at a light for awhile.  There is more, but I have to go now.  Please have a UFO expert contact me.  Thank you,  ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.6438000000004;-84.1742999999992
15 objects were doing maneuvers and then 9 objects flew at a very slow speed in pattern over our heads.;2005-06-22 14:00:00;15 minutes;15 objects were doing maneuvers and then 9 objects flew at a very slow speed in pattern over our heads. It was about 3 in the afternnon and we were swimming in our pool. My wife saw these things up in the sky. We looked up in the southwestern sky and saw about 15 objects hovering and doing manuevers. They were in this mode for about 10 minutes. They then came in a formation directly over our head. They flew slowly in formation for about 5 minutes. At this time  the shapes were very visible. They had a long body shape like a plane with wings. Only 9 of these objects were flying in this formation. The others just disappeared. After they flew overhead in formation they then did their little dance again. About 2 minutes later they got back into formation and they were out of our sight. These objects were not a plane. Planes cannot do these moves. They were flying at a relatively high altitiude. I would guess about 10 - 15,000 feet up. My wife and I are both college grads. I work in the medical implant field and she is a stay at home mother of two.
