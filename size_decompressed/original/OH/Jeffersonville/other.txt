Very green cloudy shooting star type of object in Ohio.;2007-03-11 20:00:00;5 seconds;Very green cloudy shooting star type of object in Ohio. At around 8pm on 3/11/2007 my friend and I where standing outside of our place of work when I noticed an odd object in the sky. My friend was also watching it. It started high up and streaked down toward the ground in the direction of Columbus, Ohio. It seemed to be possibly round in shape but was very cloudy looking to us. It was this awesome Shamrock green color and it seemed to have sparklies all around it, it was also very bright. The entire thing was green and different hues of green. It also seemed to have a tail to it too. It was great!;39.6562;-83.5648000000001
