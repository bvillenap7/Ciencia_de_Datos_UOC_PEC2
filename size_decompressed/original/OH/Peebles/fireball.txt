unusual lights over my house in Adams County, Ohio;2009-07-01 04:15:00;30 seconds;unusual lights over my house in Adams County, Ohio my satellite reception got bad I got out to see if the weather is bad since I didn't hear any storm sounds, looked up there was a round ball of light hight above my house (difficult to assess how high since it was night but it was the size of small car hovering in place, I turned the porch light to get better look, it moved silently and swiftly all the way to the horizon over the field in front of my house must been several miles in less then couple seconds judging buy the fact that it traveled enough to change its size from small car to the size of bright star, it remained then over that field, I called my wife to see, and I turned the porch light off within few seconds of doing so it dimmed and disappeared at the same position of the horizon where it was hovering. I'M x-military and physician, and observation is my profession, I have never seen a star or comet or even any type of men made aircraft moving in this way.;38.9833;-83.3686
