Glowing sphere spotted in telescope at dusk.;2008-05-24 20:30:00;10 minutes;Glowing sphere spotted in telescope at dusk. Sometime just around dusk, I was in Adams County, Ohio on May 24th, 2008 to do some stargazing with my telescope.  Before the stars started to come out, I was laying on the ground watching the sky when a saw a bright spot.  I assumed it was a planet, so I spun my telescope over to spot what it was.  It seemed to bright and too early.  At first I wasn’t even sure it was moving.  In the eyepiece I saw a sphere, fairly bright, and neutral colored glow.  I though something was wrong with the lens because there was something that looked like a long string extending from it, with a glowing reddish light on the end, it looked like there may have been a light where it connected also.  The string seemed to swing back and forth on the bottom of the sphere as I watched.  This object moved across the sky for about 10 minutes from about the South and West a bit, heading north.  I estimate it only crossed about 15-20 degrees of sky before it vanished.  It’s path wasn’t consistent with a pass over of the International Space Station that same night, so I’m unsure if this was some other sort of object, maybe a satellite or weather device.  I doubt the object is of any importance I just have not been able to find any other astronomical reports fitting the description of what I saw.;38.9833;-83.3686
