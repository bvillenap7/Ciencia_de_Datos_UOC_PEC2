Bright orange fireball flies across the dark evening sky;2012-06-16 23:50:00;1 minute;Bright orange fireball flies across the dark evening sky On JUNE 16TH about 11:50pm, we were outside and noticed a very bright orange object appearing such as a fireball in the sky.  It was coming from the Southeast and heading northward. It stayed on a direct path with no turns or pauses.  It was the only flying object that was in the sky at the time.   We watched this object for about a minute.  It was flying quite fast, but not as fast as a meteor, but not as slow as an airplane would.  This orange glow did not change in any shape, form or color. No sound was emitted in the evening quiet.  It just flew by over the blackness of the night sky, and headed North to Northwest and then it was gone.;41.6201;-80.5789
