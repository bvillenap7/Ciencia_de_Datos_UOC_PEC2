They appeared to be at the height of a small aircraft.   They flew over one at a time and disappeared one at a time.  They disappeared by going vertical and becoming a brilliant  white light.   They were silent and not moving very fast.  I have pictures on my cell phone.   Fascinating! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
