Straight line of lights moving across the sky over the shore of Lake Erie in NE OH.  ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites.  PD));2019-05-25 23:00:00;1 minute;Straight line of lights moving across the sky over the shore of Lake Erie in North East Ohio There was a line of about 15 lights that appeared to all be connected moving across the sky.  It was directly overhead in the dark sky with no clouds.  The lights were in a perfectly straight line and brightened intermittently.  Some lights near the front, middle, or end would become brighter sometimes one, two, or three showing brightly at the same time with no apparent sequence.  The lights were all spaced apart evenly.  The line of lights seemed to appear out of nowhere, moved across the sky in a straight line, then one after another disappeared as though they were vanishing into a spot in the sky.  (How you would imagine train cars going into a tunnel)  This event was estimated to last 60 seconds.  This was seen by myself (full time college student and homemaker), my fiance (laborer), and 13 year old daughter. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites.  PD));41.9345;-80.5803
