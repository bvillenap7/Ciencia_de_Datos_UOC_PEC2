bright lights that change direction at great speed;2000-09-19 20:05:00;1-5 min.;bright lights that change direction at great speed i was on my back deck with my dog and a cup of coffee enjoying the evening when to the west i saw a bright light inthe trees moving slowly west to east i thought it was the cleveland lifeflight coming in to the hospital. it started to flash a white light on top then it changed direction 45 degrees from its flight path straight north the top light changed to red and it gained speed so fast that i lost sight of it over the neighbors roof. it was not a planet and it was not a helicopter andit was not a civilian aircraft and if it was a military jet then the ground crew will have to scrape the pilot out of his aircraft.;41.9345;-80.5803
Northeast  Ohio dim to bright light moving west to east then going straight up at 90 degree angle very rapidly over state prison;2009-09-07 01:30:00;15 sec;Northeast  Ohio dim to bright light moving west to east then going straight up at 90 degree angle very rapidly over state prison I was talking with a fellow officer just outside my assigned housing unit when I saw what appeared to be a shooting star it started out dim got very bright moving west to east very rapidly when it got its brightest it made a 90 degree turn straight up and disappeared.the whole time it made no sound. As stated before it was over a State prison with all yard lights on.it was a very clear night.  This prison has a no fly zone also at this time of the day there is no movement of any persons at the institution,the other officer I was talking with had his back to the whole incident.  Unfortunatly I did not file any report due to ridicule from staff. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));41.9345;-80.5803
