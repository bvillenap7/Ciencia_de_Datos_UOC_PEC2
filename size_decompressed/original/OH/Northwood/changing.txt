At this time I witnessed a incredibly bright series of three lights in the eastern sky. The series of lights would change configuration. Three in a parallel, then it would change to a pyramid configuration one on top of two. When the lights would realign a small yellowish-orange orb cicled the light pattern. It entered the top and exited the bottom. I have followed the night sky for all my 40 years. At first glance I thought this was the morning star. It was in the same region as the morning star. This was not the planet Venus. This was some type of event not consistant with the normal early morning sky. I live near Lake Erie, along the flightpath from Detroit to Cleveland. I saw one aircraft follow the normal flightpath. Two aircraft flew by this object and cicled it.  I have lived in this area for my whole life. I have never seen anything similar to this.
