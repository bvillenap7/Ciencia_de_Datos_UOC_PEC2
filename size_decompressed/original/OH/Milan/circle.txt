Very fast bright orange light moving south to north.;2012-08-06 21:00:00;3 seconds;Very fast bright orange light moving south to north. I was driving back after a softball game with my girlfriend, east on 113 telling her about another time I had seen a light in the sky moving.  As soon as I pointed to the sky a bright orange object appeared low over the tree line it was very far away, and moved at a very, very high velocity across the sky from the right to left (south to north) it stopped suddenly and took off again at about a 30 to 45 degree angle outwards or upwards and vanished. I could tell it wasnâ€™t an airplane it was a bright orange color, moved very very fast, stopped on a dime and switched direction in an instant. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));41.3135;-82.6163
