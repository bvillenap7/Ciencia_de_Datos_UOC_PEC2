Perfect formation of discs shoots off to West;1986-06-15 16:00:00;3 Minutes;Perfect formation of discs shoots off to West Myself and another longtime sober member of AA were hiking on The Milan River. We took a break and observed many birds flying above the trees and river. At that time I noticed a circle of four disc (possibly metallic or possibly reflecting back light). These discs were above the few clouds that were present that day. I called to her to look at what I was seeing and she saw it immediately. At that time another disc entered the formation from the West. We just watched in awe.  They continued to circle in perfect formation and then one by one they shot off to the West and seeming to go upward until out of site. This lasted approximately 3 minutes. The circle appeared to be about the size of a basketball and the discs were about the size of a quarter. This was above the level of clouds as there was a thin cloud that the discs flew above as they left the formation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
