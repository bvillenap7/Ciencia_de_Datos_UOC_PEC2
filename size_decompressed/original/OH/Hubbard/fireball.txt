2 Fire Orange Crafts fly over Hubbard, Ohio.;2014-07-04 23:00:00;5 minutes;2 Fire Orange Crafts fly over Hubbard, Ohio. Itâ€™s the 4th of July, and I was in my backyard watching fireworks from a nearby city. The evening was a very clear sky (no Chem Trails) and a half moon was just rising above the horizon.  The temperature was about 75 degrees and slowly dropping- as it does out in the township.  I happened to glance to the east, seeing a bright light in the sky. At first, I thought it was a firework display.  The object was at least 200 feet above the tree line that is 200 yards away from where I was standing, was fire orange/red, very large, and held a definite course.  The object moved faster than any aircraft I have ever seen as well as being the largest I have ever seen within a short distance to the tree line.  It appeared to be oval, but because of its brightness, I could not discern a distinct shape.  The first object appeared at about 11:00 pm while the neighbors were lighting off small fireworks (like bottle rockets and Roman candles). It seems everyone noticed the craft and all fireworks in the area ceased. The craft came from the west and moved towards the east. My speculation is that is it came from Cleveland towards Pittsburgh. The craft was moving faster than an airplane but slower than a meteor. It appeared to be a huge ball of flame in the sky but had a clear flight path. The object moved out of range in about 2-3 minutes. We called everyone we could many had seen the same craft. The object made NO sound. About 10 minutes later, the same event occurred again. The flight path was exactly the same, the same height, direction, and duration. I have never seen an object in the sky that was this large, even a blimp would pale in comparison. As it was dark, I cannot provide a good estimate of its size ~ (This object would be about the size of 7 blimps- all fire orange).;41.1663;-80.5764
