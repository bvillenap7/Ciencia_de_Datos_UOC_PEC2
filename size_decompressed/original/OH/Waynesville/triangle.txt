Flying triangle by Waynesville, Ohio;2011-10-10 23:00:00;1:30;flying triangle by Waynesville, Ohio About 11:00 pm on Monday October, 10 2011 three friends and I witnessed a strange star that seemed to be moving very slowly.  As we watched it the bright light faded and was replaced by 1 green light one red light and two orangish-yellow lights and started moving at a pretty good rate towards us.  The ship passed directly over us and disappeared into the horizon to the south. About 15 minutes later the craft appeared again and we decided to follow it.   Not far after we started to go to where it looked like it was we heard a strange humming noise and looked up to see the craft, now a definite triangle, passing over we could also faintly see a weird spinning thing almost like a fan or propeller in the center of the craft. The craft itself was black except for the 4 lights that were on it and would blink occasionally.   After this sighting we followed it for about 15 more minutes before we lost it and decided to go back to the place where the initial sighting was.  At 11:45pm we saw the craft pass over our location again and then 3 more times at 12:00am, 12:15am, and 12:30am.  Then at 12:45 we saw four of the strange crafts flying in formation off on the horizon. This sighting at 12:45 was the last sighting we had for the night.;39.5264000000001;-84.0811999999999
