I had been in bed for a few minutes, when I felt a low vibration and low frequency noise.  Helicopter or a/c.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-27 23:00:00;~1 minute;I had been in bed for a few minutes, when I felt a low vibration and low frequency noise.  I figured a helicopter or a/c was flying over low the house because of the noise, so I looked out my bedroom window to see if I could see it.   I am not exactly sure what I saw, but it was a grid of red lights (20-30) filling approximately 1/4 of the sky outside my window in what appeared to be a pattern.   There was also a very strange symmetrical cloud formation that was slightly illuminated by the lights, and it appears the clouds had been precisely cut into a pattern of diamonds.   As I watched, the lights faded away along with the noise.  I have tried to come up with an explanation of what I saw, such as reflections, etc, but I cannot.
