Group of unknown lights over Jackson county Ohio;2020-01-14 19:15:00;~30 seconds;Group of unknown lights over Jackson county Ohio While driving south on SR 93 heading out of Wellston I noticed the bright star/planet in the sw sky. Just to the west of the star/planet there were 5 dim yellow lights hovering. It was a strange sight. I rolled down the side window to rule out any reflections and soon after the lights started disappearing.  I looked for a place to pull over and stop but they were gone before I could get to a safe stopping place.  The lights were arranged from left to right, two close together and three more further to the right.  The three on the right disappeared first then the last two disappeared one then the other. I am familiar with aircraft both military and civilian there were no sounds or FAA lights to be seen.;39.1166;-82.5461
