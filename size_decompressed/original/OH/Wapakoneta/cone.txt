large cone shaped blue white object apparently entering atmosphere;2000-08-15 23:00:00;about 30 sec;large cone shaped blue white object apparently entering atmosphere this has been a few years ago..it was either 1999 or 2000 ..probably about august or sept..i was traveling south on I-75 late at night...a little before midnight probably..a bright glare suddenly was reflected off the hood of my car..i looked up to see what the source was and saw a bright blue object in the shape of a cone with a rounded base...the rounded end was on the leading edge..it was shaped exactly like a re-entry vehicle from a nuclear missile only much larger..it appeared about the same size as a DC-10 would appear at perhaps 2000 ft elevation...large! in front of the object was a bright blue-white glow which fanned out around the rounded base and trailed around the object and then formed a very unusual tail...at approximately twice the length of the object, the tail closed in on itself and crossed over to fan out again into a cone shape that dissipated as it got farther from the object...at the point where the contrail narrowed down and crossed over itself...it formed a perfect blue disk about 3 times the diameter of the object....all of the light coming from it was bright blue with white edges, with no yellow like i would expect from a satellite re-entry or meteor...it was traveling from the north and headed in a southerly direction...probably slightly southwest but i am not sure of the roads exact heading at that point so all i can say with certainty is that it came from the north and was heading south....there was no audible noise from the object (at least none that i could hear above the noise of the car)...it disappeared into the southern sky at about 40 degrees elevation above the horizon...no fireball  or anything..it just faded away as it got farther away and appeared to get dimmer as it travelled....i mentioned the event to a guy in the navy i know and he said that they had seen nearly identical events in the persian gulf during the gulf war ( round one), but nobody ever knew what they were.....if this was the 1960's , i would have guessed a spy sattelite making a con! trolled re-entry.....but we havent done that in 30+ years...that's pretty much all the info i can give you....has always just been sitting there in the back of my mind and wondered if anyone else has seen something like this or perhaps knows what it could be ((NUFORC Note:  Witness states that date of sighting is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date in mid-August 2000.  PD));40.5718999999999;-84.1759999999999
