It suddenly grew dimmer as it moved away at a high rate of speed. About 30 seconds after I spoke to the person with me about what I had just seen, it appeared again and I was able to point it out in time for my co-worker to see it, just as it sped away growing dimmer. The dimming effect I'm assuming was caused by it moving away at a rapid rate of speed.;40.5718999999999;-84.1759999999999
bright light moving through the sky, then rapidly faded away.;2003-04-02 05:15:00;2-3 minutes;bright light moving through the sky, then rapidly faded away. We were standing out back of work smoking a cigarette.  It was just beganing to show the signs of morning, but still dark enough to barely see the stars in the sky.  There were no clouds in the area when my co-worker looked at me and said there it is again.  When working thirds we manage to catch strange lights in the sky sometimes, but this was a bright light in the sky that was moving.  It then faded away at a relatively fast rate, much faster than say the blinking of a star in the sky.  It then completely dissapeared.  Then reappeared a few moments later, still moving through the sky.  It stayed bright for a short period of time, then faded away again.  I didn't see it after that.

Strobing Red-White-Blue lights splitting in the sky.;2003-10-05 18:30:00;20 mins;Strobing Red-White-Blue lights splitting in the sky. It was a clear night with the moon shining bright. We were driving in the car in Wapakoneta, OH (The hometown of Neil Armstrong- first man to walk on the moon!) I noticed this light traveling West to East in a downward slope it was a bright light, look bright at a low flying plane of some sort. It was strobing White-Red-slight blue lights then all of a sudden it slowed way down and then we seen it split into 2 small strobing lights. The more we looked at the strobing lights, the more than seem to just simulate a plane. You could definitely tell the difference after awhile. They were more of a fading light. The 2 lights moved opposite direction and then the 2 split again into 4 strobing lights. Moving opposite of each other again. They almost seem to dance in the night sky. If you were to blink at the wrong time, you would have missed them split, it was that fast. All of a sudden, from the north, came some planes that appeared to be headed to that part of the sky. My girlfriend, seen the lights splitting and she stated she seen them split again. There was a few more planes that came in pretty fast with the activity. I don't know if they seen the activity and wondered what was going on, or they were trying to fly by to cover up the unusual activity. One could only imagine! It was definitely an unreal experience and a true UFO phenomena. Anyone else in Ohio seen this type of activity? If so email me at ((e-mail address deleted));40.5718999999999;-84.1759999999999
