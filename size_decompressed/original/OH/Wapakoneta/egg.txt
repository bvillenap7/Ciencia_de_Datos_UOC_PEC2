Egg Shaped Object in broad daylight.;1997-06-15 15:00:00;1 minute;Egg Shaped Object in broad daylight I once saw a UFO with my girlfriend at the time in Wapakoneta Ohio.  I have never formally reported it, but it did get me interested in the UFO Phenomena because even though I am skeptical of UFO's I do in fact know that people really do see things in the sky.  I do not know if they are extraterrestrial, but I do know that people honestly do see things they cannot explain. My sighting happened on a nice warm sunny day.  My girlfriends house was right next to a park and the fenceline was shared with the park.  I looked up as we were sitting outside and she was clipping her dogs hair. I then saw in plain sight a chrome looking egg shaped craft which was highly reflective and travelling at a high rate of speed. It was about the size of a couch and made no noise whatsoever.  It was slightly higher than a telephone pole in height and wasn't but about 50 yards away.  We both watched as it flew over the park and then continued on in a straight line until it disappaeared from view. I remember watching some footage one time of a silver egg shaped craft flying over a field where a supposed crop circle was found, and it looked exactly like the craft on that film. It was in broad daylight and we both watched it passing by until a tree obscured us from seeing it further.  I got up and walked to a different vantage point so that I could see it again, but I could not find it in my field of view. So that is what I saw, and it feels good to finally report it.;40.5718999999999;-84.1759999999999
