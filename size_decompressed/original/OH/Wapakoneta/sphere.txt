sphere with orange flame moving across sky.;2008-08-02 23:10:00;1.5 minutes;sphere with orange flame moving across sky. My wife and I were heading north on Glynwood-New Knoxville rd.  We were approximately 500 feet from the 33A intersection when I noticed an orange object in the Northern sky.  I immediately stopped the car and we got out trying to capture a picture of the object with our cell phones.  Unfortunately the pictures did not come out.  The object was moving from the North to the Southwest.  There was no sound.  It looked like a sphere with an orange flame moving across the sky.  It could not have been a hot air balloon because there was no canopy visible and it moved too fast across the sky.;40.5718999999999;-84.1759999999999
