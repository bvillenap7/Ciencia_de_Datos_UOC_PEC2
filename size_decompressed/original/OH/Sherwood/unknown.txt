I was leaving a friends house at around 10:00 a.m. in July of 1994. Before getting in my car I stopped to light a cigarette. While I was smoking, movement in the southeast part of the sky caught my attention. I knew it was not a bird, or any conventional aircraft by the way it was moving. Its movement was very erratic, shooting one way and then another, and without slowing was making very sharp turns. It had to be very distant from my position I can only describe it as a small sphere of intense white light. I called my friend and my brother outside to look at it. The morning was very clear, no clouds or overcast conditions. They saw the same thing as I did. We watched it for about 2 minutes when it was joined by another object of the same nature. The two objects looked to be chasing each other. After 1 minute of that, they headed off to the north/northeast. All of us followed them in my car for 3/4 of a mile (down to the corner gas station), and they were out of sight. All of this happened in the space of about 6 minutes. I have never seen anything like that again, and I doubt that I will again. I am not a believer in alien abductions, crop circles, life after death or anything else usually described as paranormal. I am a firm atheist and believe in the power of science over any God. The basis for all science is mathematics however, and it is mathematicly possible for life to exist on another planet besides our own. I guess just because we do not have the science to find other populated planets does not mean that one of those planets has not found us.;41.297;-84.5374
