Giant black aerobie floats over SW Ohio!;2001-11-25 16:00:00;15 seconds;Giant black aerobie floats over SW Ohio! I'm a restaurant manager from SW Ohio, 30 years old and no one has ever called me crazy.  I came home from work on a blustery overcast fall day, I layed down on my couch which from that angle has a view of the sky above me.  I saw against the clouds, a black circle sillouette.  It moved steadily east-ne, seemingly just under the clouds.  I jumped up to call my wife to look, but it had gone out of view behind the trees. The best I can estimate, the cloud cover was a half mile high and the object was 2-3 degrees wide and looked like a thin flat washer.;39.1641999999996;-84.2356
