About a half mile up the road, I saw a bright white light in the sky.  My first thought was it was a police helicopter conducting a search, however the light emanating from it was really bright.  There was no light trail leading to the ground so I do not believe it was a spotlight. The object was parallel to the road so it was in my direct vision.  I cannot accurately estimate how high up it was but it was maybe a few dozen feet above the tree line and it was moving very slowly. As I drove closer, I noticed what I thought was one bright light several hundred yards back was actually 3 bright lights, in triangular-like form, all facing downward. It was difficult to make the shape of the object because the lights were so bright (and it was dark) but by the orientation of the lights I would say it had more of a boomerang like shape.  There was no discernible sound coming from the object - a helicopter at that height would be very loud.  I am a smoker so my window was down. There are no shoulders on this road so I could not pull over, but I wanted to turn around and try to capture a photo of it with my phone.  However when I turned around on the next street and headed back the other direction, it was gone.;39.1641999999996;-84.2356
