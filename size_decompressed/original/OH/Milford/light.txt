My friend and I walked outside at approximately 10:58pm.  At 11:00pm was when we first had contact with the two orbs of light.   For about 5 seconds we watched in awe and amazment. I then reached in my pocket and started recording with my phone.  The two orbs of light were perfectly side by side and moving vertically at a fast pace.  16 seconds into the video the lights start to fade.   Shortly after that they fully disappeared.  You can only hear the sound of something once it is over head and nothing once fully gone.  Futhermore there were no blue and red lights to indicate any kind of aircraft.;39.1641999999996;-84.2356
