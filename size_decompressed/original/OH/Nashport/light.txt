My wife got out of the car and looked up in the sky and said what are those strange orange lights.  I immediately looked up in the sky and saw 2 lights moving approximately Southwest, at the speed of a small aircraft.  I moved to a better vantage point and saw for lights moving Southwest in a diamond formation. I had my new Samsung Galaxy note 7 cell phone.  I pointed it to the sky and took 2 photos, and 2 videos.  This was over period of about 30 seconds.  The lights where as bright as Jupiter on a clear dark night.  They were flying in a perfect diamond formation, evenly spaced out. I am an amateur pilot, I am 67 years old my wife is 66 years old a retired school teacher. We are always looking up at aircraft.  The thing that struck us funny was there were no blinking red or green lights, nor white lights.  They were steady bright orange lights.  The other thing that was strange was, there was no sound.  It was perfectly quiet.  Small aircraft flying over I always hear the engines running and jet aircraft I just about always hear the jet engines, unless they are flying at extremely high altitudes.  These craft were moving at a very steady pace, that of a small Cessna 172 if it was flying about 1500 feet above the ground.  There should have been sound.  Not being any sound flying the speed they appeared to be going, they could have been going at mach speed with no sonic boom.  It was very strange;40.0361;-82.0965
