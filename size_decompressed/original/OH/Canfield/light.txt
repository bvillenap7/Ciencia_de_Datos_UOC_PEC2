There are no towers over that way that I've ever seen before.  And I often look as I usually look at the sky while walking my dog.  I was looking at Orion this evening when I noticed this thing it was almost straight down from the first star in Orions belt.  I'm still observing it does seem to be getting somewhat higher but still a white light flashing red and blue.  Maybe its a star I don't know I've never vseen a star flash like that before ((NUFORC Note:  The report is not inconsistent with a bright star that appears in the southeastern sky during the early morning hours.  We have received many reports about it.));41.0272;-80.7518
