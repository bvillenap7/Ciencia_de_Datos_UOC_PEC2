Strong white lit object seen over Canfield, OH for 15 minutes.;2009-12-04 20:00:00;15 minutes;Strong white lit object seen over Canfield, OH for 15 minutes. Driving along US Rt. 224 in Ellsworth, OH into Canfield, OH, a strong white light was seen for 15 straight minutes out in the distance a couple thousand feet in the air.   As we approached the heart of Canfield, OH we saw the light and it was moving VERY slowly through the sky. I cannot see how it was a plane because it would have been moving a lot faster.  It was not a star because it was so close to the ground.  I question if it is a helicopter because I've never seen one hover in the sky like that and I heard no noise.
