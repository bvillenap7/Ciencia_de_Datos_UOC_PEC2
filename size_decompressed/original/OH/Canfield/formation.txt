Large obj. with bright red, orange, and yellow lights in SE sky in Canfield Ohio, moved towards us, stopped and disappeared backwards.;2013-07-17 23:30:00;15 minutes;large object with bright red, orange, and yellow lights in SE sky in Canfield Ohio, moved towards us, stopped and disappeared backwards Myself and a new acquaintance had just finished dinner at The Kensington golf club and restaurant in Canfield when we looked up in the clear sky to the SE and saw a very large object with very bright lights on it moving toward us.  As it got closer, it appeared to be very large.   We tried to get pictures with our cell phone cameras and only got white halo's around it.  It appeared to have been watching us, then suddenly went backwards by into the sky and dis-appeared.   No other aircraft could have maneuvered backwards that fast and dis-appeared so fast.;41.0272;-80.7518
