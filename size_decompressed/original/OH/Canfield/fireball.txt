Total of 7 Balls of light over Boardman area.;2011-08-04 23:00:00;5 minutes;Total of 7 Balls of light over Boardman area. We were sitting on our deck just after 11:00pm, we live at the highest elevation in the Canfield Boardman area, and our condo has a 2nd floor deck that over looks Boardman, you can see most of Boardman and all the way north to Youngstown.   I was sitting alone first and noticed all of a sudden North of boardman 3 lights appeared at the same time and were moving slowly towards the south west.  I am a Commercial pilot and see aircraft everywhere at night because of our view so I figured it was three C-130s out of youngstown in formation as they do night exercises often.   My attention was drawn though as they stopped their motion and simply hovered just north of 224 in Boardman at what I would call 3-4 miles away.  At that point one went down to ground level, and I could no longer see it, and two remained hovering.   I started calling for my girl friend who then came out and saw the two hovering, within about 10 seconds of her coming out 3 more lights rose from the ground quickly and then stopped at the other twos' altitude.   The 5 of them then hovered for probably another minute or two, then two of them rose up slowly and vanished,  one last light rose from the ground further north then and they all ascended and were not able to be seen.   I have never seen anything like this and as I pilot I know they were not aircraft, no noise was associated with them at my distance, either.;41.0272;-80.7518
