A few friends and I were driving along a country road in Canfield Ohio at 5:30 pm when I looked up out my window about 40 feet above the car we were in I encountered a diamond shaped clear or chrome object with 4 bright purple lights for about 20 seconds not realizing what it was but then it very quickly vanished out of the area with no smoke left behind or knowledge of what direction this thing went and this day changed my life because I've spotted something very powerful and I need to know what the object was.
