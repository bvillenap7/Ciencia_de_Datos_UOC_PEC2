While driving west on the Ohio Turnpike just after we crossed the state line from PA, my wife and I observed a black saucer shape in the sky just above the horizon. It was motionless and did not appear to have any lights or emit any light. The object appeared to be quite large and miles away. At first we thought it might be a cloud but its shape was too perfect. It was also much darker than the sky and the few clouds that hung low on the horizon.  We observed it for about 3-5 minutes until it disappeared very quickly.
