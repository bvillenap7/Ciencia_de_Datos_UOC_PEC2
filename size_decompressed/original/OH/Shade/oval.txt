Luminescent green and yellow object over Pratts Fork, Ohio;2013-05-30 23:04:00;5-7 seconds;Luminescent green and yellow object over Pratts Fork, Ohio On May 30th 2013 at 11:04 pm I was sitting on my front porch in Pratts Fork Ohio, facing west, and I saw in the night sky an object which was travelling from a northwesterly direction to what appeared to be a northeasterly direction.  It was in a descending pattern. I only saw it for approximately 5 to 7 seconds.  I had no time to get my camera on my phone pulled up before it was out of sight. If you imagine a star as a pinpoint in the night sky, this object was, by comparison, roughly the size of a plastic pop bottle.  I am 100%  positive it was within our atmosphere.  It is hard to estimate how high in the air it was. the ground across the road from my house lies on a small hill.  The object appeared over that raised area and to my thoughts was close to say 500' possibly 1000' in the air. There was no sound and no trail behind it.  This was not an aircraft or a helicopter or any other man made device.  I have tried for the last 4 days to think of how to describe it. The only thing I can come up with is an elongated oval. It was not circular, or cigar shaped. it was not oval shaped, it was more like an elongated oval.  The object was duel colored. The entire somewhat oval shaped exterior was a luminescent, neon, glowing green. The brightest green I have ever seen in my life. The interior was a solid glowing yellow.  At 11:05 pm that night, one minute after seeing the object, I called the Athens, Ohio branch of the Ohio state highway patrol, and spoke to dispatcher Saunders and told him what I saw.  I swear this to be true on my eternal soul! I will never forget it as long as I live!  I reported this event to the hotline on Saturday evening/Sunday morning at 12:26 am EST. The gentleman I spoke to was about to go on the radio and didn't have much time to talk and asked me to submit this form.;39.2129;-82.0218
