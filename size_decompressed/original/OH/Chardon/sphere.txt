Blue orb hovering over trees, then crosses feild.;2001-02-20 23:00:00;3-4 minutes;Blue orb hovering over trees, then crosses feild. I was burning brush in our back yard. My house is rather secluded, so other than the light from the fire, it was very dark. I walked away from the fire, and walked deeper into the yard. On either side of the feild is forest. I happen to look to the north and noticed a blue ball of light through the trees. It appeared to be roughly 50 ft. above the tree tops. It slowly hovered to the south, crossing the feild. There was no sound, only the blue light. It continued south in a straight line, until it vanished over the south tree line.;41.5696;-81.2095999999998
