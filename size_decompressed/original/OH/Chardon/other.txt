Dual winged object that appeared like a jet.;2018-05-25 20:15:00;30 seconds;Dual winged object that appeared like a jet. We noticed an object flying in the sky from west to east that look like a normal jet with a secondary set of wings up front.  The wings up front were smaller than the wings in the back.  This object was flying low at 5 to 10k feet and it was abnormally loud at a lower frequency, almost like low level rumbling thunder.  We both tried to get cell video, but it was so fuzzy you couldn't tell in the video.  I searched all over the net and could not find one example of anything that looked like this.  It was not refueling in mid-air, only one body was sighted.;41.5696;-81.2095999999998
