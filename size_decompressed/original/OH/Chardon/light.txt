Three lights spotted over rural area.;2017-01-28 20:29:00;2-3 minutes;Three lights spotted over rural area. I was on the second floor of my home, sitting on a couch that looks out a east facing window.  I noticed a bright light sitting directly above the tree line of my front yard. I went to the window to take a closer look to see if it was a plane or a drone.  The light did not waiver and sat, about the size of a beach ball in one spot.  At this time it was 8:29 p.m and snow was densely falling outside.  The light was  bright enough to be clearly seen, even in the adverse weather.  I opened the window to listen for sounds such as a helicopter or airplane but none were present.  It felt as though the light was watching me and I was watching it. I shut my blinds and continued to watch the light through them.  Suddenly 2 more beach ball sized lights appeared.  One was positioned about 75 feet away from the first light, but hung at the same level.  The second was about 100 feet over to the right, and hung lower than the other two.  I called down to my husband, and joined him a! t the window on the first floor of our home.  We watched the lights together for about another minute, and then all three started moving toward the left, northbound up the street and out of sight.   I am a 64 year old librarian and my husband is a 69 year old retired brick mason and decorated Vietnam combat medic.  We have resided in our home since 1987 and have never witnessed this phenomenon before.;41.5696;-81.2095999999998

Woke up & saw bright light, like search light in sky above treeline.  So bright, it illuminated clouds behind it.  Seemed like it got brighter.  No noise.  Thought it was a helicopter search light but stationary.  Then as soon as decided to get in my car & look at closer - it rurned off like a flashlight.;41.5696;-81.2095999999998
