Perfect triangular shape with fainter white lights at all three points.  A very distinct red slowly blinking light on the bottom of the craft with a good amount of distance between the red light and any of the white ones.   It moves pretty slow to the northeast with no sound.  I watched it for about 7 minutes.   I'm pretty sure it wasn't a plane especially because planes have a couple different colors of blinking lights and this craft was low enough that I could see detail.
