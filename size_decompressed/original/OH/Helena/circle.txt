Me and my Buddies were celebrating cinco de mayo, and we were outside talking and sometimes we would play basketball. Well we were taking a brake from a game of basketball I looked up at the stars and i saw like a disc shape craft that hovered in the air. It did not make any nosie, I stayed there for about a minute. While this is going on i told my buddies to look up and they saw it too. One of my friends ran inside to grab a camera. The rest of us just was amused by the bright lights of the craft. The craft also was spinning in place. Then the craft took off as it was shot out of a rocket. It left out of sight. My buudy came out with the camera and asked where it went, and we told him that it left. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.
