White light appeared, moved, and disappeared.;2011-03-01 21:30:00;3 seconds;White light appeared, moved, and disappeared. I was sitting in my jeep outside my house.  The house is about 2/3 down a shallow hill, street is lined with trees. I was looking up the hill, and through the trees, i saw a white light (circular. too small to tell if it was spherical) appear, travel north/northwest quickly and with constant speed for about 2 seconds, then disappear. no sound.  Weather was cool, calm, and partly cloudy. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.0946;-83.0118
