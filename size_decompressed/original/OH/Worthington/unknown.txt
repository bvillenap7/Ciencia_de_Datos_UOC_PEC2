Orange fire balls /fire ball craft;2013-09-01 19:30:00;10 minutes;Orange fire balls /fire ball craft I was walking down Park RD & once I reached the tracks (by the flint carry out) I looked up & saw 10 glowing orange objects moving fairly slow.  5 of them began aligning in a horizontal straight line one by one exactly the same difference between each other two others disappeared faster than a blink of an eye three appeared in a perfect triangle or a large craft it was at least 5 miles wide it began to rotate 360 degrees aligning so the bottom 2 lights on the craft or objects made a perfect eclipse.   I've never believed in ufo's but there is no logical explanation for these anomalies...;40.0946;-83.0118
