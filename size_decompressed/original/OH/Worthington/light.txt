Two bright light appeared out of no where in the clear day sky one after another.;2019-09-24 07:20:00;<1 minute;Two bright light appeared out of no where in the clear day sky one after another. I was driving east on Snouffer Rd in Worthington, OH at 7:20AM. I was at a stopped light while looking up at the sky.  The sky was completely clear with no clouds and the sun was rising.  There was a black plane noted to the far right, which was easily identifiable but the sky was otherwise clear with no other planes or clouds.   Suddenly, out of nowhere there was a bright white, round light that appeared straight eastward.  The light hovered for about 10-20 seconds when suddenly a second bright white light appeared to the upper right of the first bright white object.  They both hovered there with no movement for about 30-40 seconds.  I was unable to stay and continue watching as I was at a stop light and unable to hold up traffic.  They were clearly not airplanes and appeared as if two of the brightest stars Iâ€™ve ever seen just randomly appeared in the day sky.;40.0946;-83.0118
