Flame to red object that flew towards the moon.;2013-06-23 23:26:00;3 minutes;Flame to red object that flew towards the moon. At 11:26 p.m. June 23, 2013 I looked into the dark cloudless sky in front of my condo and saw a flame hovering above the treeline near Sancus Blvd. and Ficus Dr.  The flame hovered for 90 seconds.  Moving only slightly.  I opened the door while still looking at the flame and told my boyfriend to come look at this thing in the sky.  I looked in at him and said, &quotCome look!&quot.   He came over and looked at the flame in the sky and said, &quotWe should take pictures of this.&quot.  So, I went in the house and grabbed my iPod.  Came back outside and the flame had flown up higher in the pitch black sky.  I took a picture of the object.  Then, I decided to take a video. I could still see the object in the sky clearly with my eyes.  However, in the video it just looks like a small red dot. I watched it go straight up into the sky and then head directly towards the moon.  In my photo the object looks white and L or V shaped. As for your request: The FAA said the wind velocity for my location last night at 11:26 p.m. was &quotI can't help you with that, Call the weather people.&quot So, I called the NOAA and for Wind Velocity for my location at 11:26 p.m. last night and they said, &quotabout 5 miles per hour&quot. He was rather rude. I was looking up into the sky in a South East Direction at the 120 mark on a compass.;40.0946;-83.0118
