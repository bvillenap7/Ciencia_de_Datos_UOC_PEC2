There was about 8 orange lights in the sky. He ran to the house to get me. He said to hurry up or I would miss it.  I ran outside and seen the lights they were in a group but you could tell they were all separate they Were moving away from us.  Then I ran back to the house and told my sister, niece, and her boyfriend. We were all watching the lights and they were moving away from us up into the sky. Then to the right of us there was another one. It was closer to the ground and it was moving fast . It was moving in a eastern direction towards us.  Then it took a turn to the South and went straight up in the air behind the other 8 of them. They had a Orange glow to them it was dark outside and they were very noticeable. The one that came across the sky was moving at a high rate of speed. I have never seen Anything move that fast.  Plus the way it turned and went straight up into the atmosphere. We found out we werenâ€™t the only ones to see it. Some neighbors that live 1 mile away Also seen it.  We live in the country with a lot of farm fields all around us. This is the first Time we have ever seen anything like this.  We keep our eyes to the sky now.;41.5335;-83.3566
