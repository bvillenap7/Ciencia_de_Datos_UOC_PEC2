Strange star like ball of light follows plane and then tales off;2011-08-06 23:00:00;One minute;Strange star like ball of light follows plane and then tales off Me and my boyfriend were outside watching the stars and talking when I noticed a plane flying towards Cleveland.  When I looked behind it I saw what I thought was a star at first until I seen it moving (It was just a little ball of light that from that far up, looked like a white- blue orb/ ball of light)) just to make sure my eyes weren't deceiving me   I quickly had my boyfriend look at it.  Sure enough he seen it to and thought it was strange.  We watched it follow the plane and then veer off in a U shape towards a star where it quickly disappeared into the blackness.  We didn't see it after that, it was just gone as;41.5282;-80.8186
