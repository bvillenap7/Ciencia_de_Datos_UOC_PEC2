Huge doughnut shaped object hovering over the trees.;2010-04-01 15:00:00;5 minutes;I was in the back bedroom of the house when I heard my mom and nephew age 10 at the time  frantically yelling for me.   I walk out on the balcony and look up to see what they are looking at and I saw a huge doughnut shaped object hovering over the trees  It was a doughnut shape  with a whole in the center and the shiniest metal I have ever seen , It was hovering with no sound and was floating  perpendicular to the ground   Terrified by what I was looking at I grabbed my nephew and pushed him in the house and went for my mother who was amazed by it and not scared at all would not let go of the rail of the balcony by then my nephew had run back outside so I carried him in the house and heard my mom yell that there was now three more in the sky, not looking up I went to pull her in the house and she wouldn't let go so I stayed in the house with the kid and soon after she came inside and said the clouds had passed over them and just that fast they were gone.
