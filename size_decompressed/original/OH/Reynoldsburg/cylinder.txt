Cylinder shaped object moving east appearing behind jet contrails, reflecting daylight inconsistently.;2003-12-01 12:07:00;1 minute;Cylinder shaped object moving east appearing behind jet contrails, reflecting daylight inconsistently. What appeared to be a cylinder shaped object moving in a easterly direction appeared in broad daylight.  It was very high in the sky and was the size of a ball point pen tip held at arms length.  I normally would have passed this off as a plane, but I had exactly that to compare it to in the sky.  The object passed behind the contrail of a jet airplane moving in the opposite direction, but left no contrail of it's own.  Also, the object seemed to reflect the sun's rays inconsistently, and was not constantly illuminated by the sun as the airplane moving in the opposite direction.  The thought passed through my mind that it may be a satellite, but I have never seen such from the ground with no visual aid.  Lastly, I detected no characteristics of the object from the list below.  (Is that odd?);39.9580999999999;-82.8067999999993
On this night, I noticed a cylinder shaped illuminated object in the southeast sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible contrail??  PD));2004-08-31 21:00:00;10 minutes;On this night, I noticed a cylinder shaped illuminated object in the southeast sky. At first I thought it was a portion of the moon with the rest being onscured by clouds. At second look, I realized that it was a clear night and there were no clouds. I realized that it was some type of object that was moving slowly across the sky from southeast to northwest. I watched it for about 5 minutes before calling my 14 year old son outside to look at it. We watched it for another five minutes. The object was lit by a clear light that was constant. No blinking or other lights. It moved horizontally across the sky at a very slow speed. Towards the end, the light seemed to slowly diminish and it just faded away. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have observed a contrail behind a high-altitude aircraft.  Just a guess.  PD));39.9580999999999;-82.8067999999993
