And I see a light with a twitch out of the corner of my eye so I kinda watch...  And all of a sudden this huge egg shape that's like bright neon blue with small line green lights shoots across the sky and kinda rests behind some trees and hovers there for a second and takes off and is just gone again.

And we looked up and seen a egg shaped form in the sky.  It was traveling too fast to be a airplane and it had no comtrail and no noise.   We took a picture of it. It was flying west to east.  And also became very bright before it disappeared.  Very weird.;39.9580999999999;-82.8067999999993
