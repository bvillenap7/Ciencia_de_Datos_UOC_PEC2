At around 11:30 pm I noticed really bright lights out my 3rd floor apartment window and started watching them. my husband and his friend and I watched as a big bright fire ball hovered over the tree line not too far away and the first thing i noticed was that the bright light was staying in one place and then after about 1 min they would go straight  up and they had no sound. the event lasted about 45 min. In that time we saw  approx 10 objects. the strange thing was some were different. One of them started out as a bright light hovering to going up just above the tree line and it turned off the light and there was a red light blinking, one was a sphere and it had lights around the middle of it . I have lived in a mile radius of this sighting all my life and have always seen weird things and other people I know have seen the same. I think it might have something to do with Rickenbacker Airport that is located about 5 miles away and I have heard that they moght be keeping something there. And there was no planes going or taking off during the hours of 11:30 to 12:30 pm .;39.9580999999999;-82.8067999999993
Yellowish orange ball of fire travelling across the sky;2013-08-16 21:30:00;45-60 seconds;Yellowish orange ball of fire travelling across the sky We were looking in a westerly direction at 9:30 EST and saw what looked like a glowing ball of fire moving from the Northern to the Souther sky.  It travelled the full length of our horizon vision.   As it took over 45 seconds to travel that far it seemed to be going the speed of an airplane at a height of take-off ( we live about 10 miles from Port Columbus ).   There was no sound, smoke, or tail.  It was moving in a steady pace and direction.   Again, it appeared as a sphere of yellowish/orange ball of fire.   There was no visible structure nor any blinking lights.;39.9580999999999;-82.8067999999993
