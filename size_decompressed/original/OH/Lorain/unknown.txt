I saw different colored lights in the sky southeast of me;2006-11-15 23:00:00;30 minutes;I saw different colored lights in the sky southeast of me I was walking my dog down the street and around the block, I saw different colored lights in the sky to the southeast of me,they did not look like the stars that were out that night.These lights were colors of red,blues,and greens,and white,it was so odd because I have never seen stars that looked like this.I noticed them when I was walking my dog, and when I got back to my house they were still there,stationary in the sky,not moving as stars do.I wear glasses at night to drive or if I go to a movie theater,in other words,to see things far away,so when I got back to my house,I got my glasses,put my dog inside,and went out to look at it.The lights were still there in the same place,I even told my husband to come out and look at the UFO,he was too cold to come outside.I know this was around the time the UFO was seen at O'hara Arport.
