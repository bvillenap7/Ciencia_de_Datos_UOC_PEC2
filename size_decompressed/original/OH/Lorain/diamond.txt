I alone observed 8 deep-red light-colored objects in the sky, proceeding from west to east, a ways out from the shore, of Lake Erie.  The best analogy I can think of is moving Christmas ornaments!  A red top, perhaps round, not sure, with a long glowing downward tail, again, all red.  The first objects were four in number, not in rigid formation, but somewhat close together, followed by two more objects 10 seconds or so later, followed again by two more objects, about 20 seconds later.  Since I don't know how high up they really were, I cannot estimate their speed, BUT, sometimes one or two would slow down just a bit, and then so would the others.  It is a quiet night up here, little to no wind, clear sky with stars, not much traffic in my neighborhood 2 blocks from Lake Erie.;41.4406385869563;-82.1584385869567
