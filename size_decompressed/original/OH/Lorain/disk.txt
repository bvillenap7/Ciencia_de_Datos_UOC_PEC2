UFO near Cleveland Ohio, evening of 2/12/02.;2002-02-12 20:00:00;1-2 minutes;UFO near Cleveland Ohio, evening of 2/12/02. I was traveling on the Interstate 90, East bound.  About 20 miles west of Cleveland, OH.  A bright orange, yellowish light in the sky, off to the left hand side caught my eye.  I couldn't make out much detail at this time, but as I got closer to the object (after traveling 30-45 seconds), I realized that it wasn't a plane or anything of that nature.  I saw numerous windows where the light was emiting from.  The light was also emiting from the bottom.  I continued to watch the object for another 10-15 seconds and then it appeared as though it was sucked into the clouds.  Moving almost vertically.;41.4406385869563;-82.1584385869567
