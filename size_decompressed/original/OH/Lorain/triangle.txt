Five flashing triangular objects viewed from Lorain, Ohio;2014-10-15 19:28:00;3 minutes;Five flashing triangular objects viewed from Lorain, Ohio I am including a picture of another ufo report I made on February 26, 2010 as a reference to what I saw tonight.  If you look at the picture , what I saw tonight was in the same place.  I was sitting on my back porch at 7:28 pm eastern time and saw a single object that looked triangular in shape. The top of it had two flashing white lights and the bottom a single flashing red light.  The three lights formed a triangle.  It was approaching me head on. The craft appeared to be about a mile away, but it is difficult to gauge the distance because I didn't know the actual size of it.  Since this is not a usual airline flight path, I assumed it was a helicopter.  I watched it for about 15 seconds and saw it change course at what looked like a 90 degree turn to its left as well as about a 45 degree trajectory upwards.  Not that unusual, I thought.  But before itdisappeared, I saw two more identically looking objects approach from the same spot the first one appeared.  They were at the same height  the first one was when it initially appeared and were side by side about the width of my pinky finger held out in front of me.  These two also turned to their left and began an ascent at about 45 degrees.  A second set of two identically looking objects then appeared just as the first set had done.  They approached me and then made the same turn to their left and about a 45 degree ascent.  I saw a total of five objects.  As each object made their turn, they became barely visible and looked like little dots of white  light.  I could no longer see any red in them.  Each object disappeared into the clouds  about 15 seconds after it turned.  Although the five objects looked different from the ones in my report of Feb. 26, 2010,  they approached from the same spot in the sky.  Also, their approach pattern was different, appearing in three patterns, one after the other.  The original siting had them in formation, all together.;41.4406385869563;-82.1584385869567
