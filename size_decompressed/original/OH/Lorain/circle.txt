big orange ball floating steady through the sky in Ohio on July 4, 2010;2010-07-04 22:00:00;22:00;big orange ball floating steady through the sky in Ohio on July 4, 2010 We were sitting on the beach at Lakeview Park in Lorain, OH, waiting for the Fireworks show to start.   Somebody spotted this big orange ball moving across the sky slow but steady and everyone commented that they'd never seen an aircraft, plane or chopper look like that before and there was no noise coming from it.   I proceeded to capture it on video with my camera and have included the link. Shortly after it disappeared another followed behind.  Someone on Facebook told me that it was a new kind of fireworks display but I have not heard anything of the sort anywhere else. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWycp3JjdBw ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.
