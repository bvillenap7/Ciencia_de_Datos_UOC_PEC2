Red Triangle Over West Jefferson.;1981-01-12 22:00:00;1 minute;Red Triangle Over West Jefferson The winter of 1981 in West Jefferson, Ohio.  I was driving north on Inwood drive (in front of the swimming pool) heading toward Rt. 40.  Straight ahead over the trees surrounding Little Darby Creek were three red lights in a triangular pattern.  It was solid in between the lights.  It moved north a little further, possibly over Haymarket Rd. off Taylor-Blair Rd. and turned completely sideways into a left hand turn and disappeared.  As they all say, it was roughly the size of a football field.   At 10 pm in West Jefferson the town is empty and everyone I ever asked just looked at me like I was crazy.
