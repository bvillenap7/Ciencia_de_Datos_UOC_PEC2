Mysterous Bright light and Cylinder.;2017-11-29 07:45:00;5 minutes;Mysterous Bright light and Cylinder. From the east (near Us Rt 40) notice a bright light in the distance moving west.  I had a FlightAware app on my phone and there was not any commercial aircraft in my area.   The light came closer to the ground and a white cylinder appeared in sky.  It was traveling west with no emissions.  It was traveling too fast to be a balloon.   My first thought it was the ISS, but it was over South America at the time I seen the object.;39.9392;-83.2824999999999
