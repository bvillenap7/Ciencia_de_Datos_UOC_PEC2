Saucer rims were seen near Beavercreek, Ohio on December 26, 2003;2003-12-26 15:00:00;30 minutes;Saucer rims were seen near Beavercreek, Ohio on December 26, 2003 We saw the vapor trail of an airplane that seemed to be heading straight down, i.e., toward the earth.  We stopped our vehicle as it appeared that a crash was near.  The plane suddenly made a right angle turn and stopped.  What we could see was the edge of a saucer. It was diagonal in the sky...top, left side higher than the right lower side.  It was easily seen in a sky that was almost completely without clouds.  It was about as bright as a plane's vapor trail on a clear day.  The object slowly changed its position, but never lost the brightness.  Then we saw another plane do the exact same apparent plunge to the earth and make the exact same turn and the 2 disc edges remained in the sky.  Since they were just sitting in the sky, we drove the few miles left to our hostess' house and told them all to go outside.  The 4 of us who observed this event, jumped into the car again and drove until we could see this phenomenon again.  This occured on December 26, 2003 around 3 pm EST.  We were in Beavercreek, Ohio and the discs were in the Southern part of our sky.  While we parked, a 3rd phenomenon occured exactly like the first 2.  We saw the 3 separate occurances, but never saw more than 2 discs together.  There were 4 people in the vehicle.  A woman 67, a woman 41, a boy 7 years old and a boy 3 years old.  All of us saw it and the 7 year old was frightened by what was clearly observed by all of us. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that contrails would have to be ruled out, before we would suspect UFO's, although we have no idea what the witnesses may have seen.  PD));39.69994;-84.07076
