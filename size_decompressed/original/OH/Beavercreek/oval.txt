((anonymous report));2018-07-04 21:00:00;1 hour;Just debunking the red DRONE that was seen on the forth of july.  It was a drone with red lights taking video for the fireworks.  It was clearly a drone.  I hate attention seeking posters. They had to have know it was small and hovered over the crowed and panned the camera to catch the entire event at Rottery park.
