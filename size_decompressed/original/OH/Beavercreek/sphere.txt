White balloon-like white ball travelling against heavy winds.;2004-04-18 15:00:00;15-20 seconds;White balloon-like white ball travelling against heavy winds. I was getting some fresh air on this clear sunny day, sitting on a step.  It was pretty windy at the time, gusting from West to East. What I saw was a white sphere in the air about the size of a large pea at arm's length.  It looked like one of those really big balloons used at car lots sometimes to hold up long streamers (i.e. did not look metallic, had no external lights, just a white ball shaped object).   I can't swear that it _wasn't_ one of those balloons, but it was defying those major gusts of wind by going from South to North.  And as it bobbed up and down along its path, it was generally going down (not up like a loose balloon would).   I lost sight of it as it passed over a hill.   Did anyone else see this?;39.69994;-84.07076
