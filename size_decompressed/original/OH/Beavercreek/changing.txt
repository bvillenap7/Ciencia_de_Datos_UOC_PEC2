The contrails disappeared very quickly--far more so than a jet's.  Then the bright light at the end of the contrail just hung in the sky in the same position for a while, them shifted degree angles.  AT times it was extremely bright, then it would fade.  Then it would disappear and reappear.  We saw 3 of these objects over a 30 minute period. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that contrails would have to be ruled out, before we would suspect UFO's, although we have no idea what the witnesses may have seen.  PD));39.69994;-84.07076
