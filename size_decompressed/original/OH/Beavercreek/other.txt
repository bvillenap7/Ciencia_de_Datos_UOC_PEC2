I said look is orin belt, but it wasn't. It had to many stars on the belt. Instead of three there where five, i thought this was odd, as we starred and questioned what it was the first star on the left moved down and very quickly moved to the left behind the fifth star. After reaching its postion it did this circle motion in a counter clockwise motion while staying in its postion,it stopped and disapeared. I said,did you see that! As soon the words were spoken the second star did the exact samething....and so on until all five stars where gone. I didn't blink once because i didn't want to miss a thing. This is on in a million shot to see and i am glade me and my friend where there to witness something amazing! Believe me this wasn not airplane, it moved to quick.;39.69994;-84.07076
