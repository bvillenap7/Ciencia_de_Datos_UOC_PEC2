Light chashing USAF transport.;1971-08-15 19:00:00;<30 seconds;Light chashing USAF transport. This sighting occurred on a late summer evening, just before dark in the early 70s.   I was in my early teens, and we lived in rural Greene Co, between Xenia and Beavercreek, Ohio.   At the time the area was all farm land with just a smattering of old farm houses, including our home.  My younger brother and I were in our back yard when I noticed a USAF C-119 transport approaching Wright-Patterson AFB (10 miles away) from the east.  (I assume the aircraft was one from Lockbourne AFB near Columbus where an Air Force Reserve C-119 unit was based at the time.  C-119s were very common sights as a result.)  The aircraft was probably at 2000-3000 ft, flying at around 150 mph.  As I watched I saw a brilliant light, quite small and very well defined, streak into view from overhead (approximately 30 degrees from the vertical from a southwestwardly direction) heading directly towards the transport.  For the next 15-20 seconds, the light darted around the C-119 at very high speed, performing sharp maneuvers flying above, below and around the aircraft.  The light then sped off in the same direction from which it came, although climbing at a significantly shallower angle than it arrived.  Within seconds it was out of sight.  Total time the light was in sight was less than 30 seconds. During the encounter, there was no sound other than the piston engines of the transport.   The C-119 did not appear to take any evasive action, meaning either the crew didn’t see the light or saw it so briefly they didn’t have time to react.   The C-119 continued towards WPAFB, where I assume it landed. I specifically remember watching the local news for the next few days, and reading the local newspapers to see if the incident was reported.  It was not uncommon for UFOs to be reported on TV and in the newspapers of the day, but no mention of the light I witnessed was reported by Dayton or Xenia media that I could find.

Red light objects flying over Dayton;2012-12-22 21:00:00;5 minutes;red light objects flying over Dayton Driving south on Trebein Rd near Fairground Rd we saw about 6 lights/objects in the sky flying in a single file line to the north east.  These lights/objects looked peculiar because they were bright red lights with a pulsating white light.   They did not look like any airplane or helicopter I had ever seen.  They were peculiar looking enough that several cars were pulling off to the side of the road to get out and take a better look.     They carried on their course and didn't make any strange maneuvers or anything but when I did get out to look up at them they did not make any sound that I could hear.   It is possible that they could have been any number of things, but there was just something strange about the way that they moved and the brightness of the lights that really seemed odd.   Again, it caught the attention of so many other motorists that I know I was not alone in my feeling about them. I'd be curious to see if there are any other reports on this si! te about people seeing the same lights that I saw...;39.69994;-84.07076

The sun had completely set and there was a small amount of fog settling in.  There were clouds just above the horizon.  We saw a set of two lights in the West sky near the area of Kettering climbing at a slow rate from South to North.  These lights were an equal distance apart and continued that way throughout the sighting.  About 5 seconds later there were two more sets.  This continued for approximately 3 minutes with a total of 10 lights all making the same movement.  The lights were steady red (not flashing) and no sound could be heard.;39.69994;-84.07076
