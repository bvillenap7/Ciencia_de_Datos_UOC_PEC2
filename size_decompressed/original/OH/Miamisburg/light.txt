A round object as bright as the Sun but smaller.;2013-09-23 19:30:00;1 minute;A round object as bright as the Sun but smaller. As I step out of a department store and was walking to my car I saw an extremely bright light in the skyâ€¦as bright as the Sun but smaller.  The brightness only lasted about 10 seconds.  My first thought was that it was a metallic craft which was reflecting the setting Sun.  After the first 10 seconds, the brightness started to diminish.  The object was extremely high in the shy (Approx. 50 degrees up moving in the Southwest direction) and my thinking at that point was that I was watching the Sun reflect off the International Space Station.   As the brightness diminishes, I could see that the object seemed to be round in shape, but very small because of the distance.  I was able to visually follow the object for about 60 seconds, as it got smaller and smaller until it went out of sight due to distance.  I estimate that the object disappeared at about 30 degrees from the horizon. I thought that I witnessed the ISS but was not sure because of the shape.  When I returned home, I checked the orbital direction of the ISS.  I found that it was not close to my location and that it was orbiting in the Northeast direction.  The object I saw was travelling in the Southwest direction.;39.6319999999997;-84.2634000000001

Look like a drop glowball.;2014-04-15 23:00:00;1 minute;Look like a drop glowball. On my way to work 3rd shift, driving up the road and right in front of me in clear distant I saw like a very bright light blueish white color just appear in the sky, like a bright star. You could not miss it, it just pop up as if someone turn on a flashlight, guessing about 5 mile in front of me high in the sky. Next thing I saw it just drop stright down towards the ground and disappered just that quick, I thought it would hit the ground but then it vanished. I served 12 years in the Marines, been on countless field operations plus Desert Storm and I have never seen anything like what I just saw.;39.6319999999997;-84.2634000000001
Fast moving white light.;2014-07-10 23:00:00;3 seconds;Fast moving white light A bright light flying towards the mound center, close to the ground, moving faster than anything that I've ever seen in the sky before.  Then it disappeared in mid air.   It wasn't making any noise.   It was kind of an ovalish light orb thing.;39.6319999999997;-84.2634000000001
Bright Red Light.;2015-05-24 22:00:00;10-15 seconds;Bright Red Light. Getting ready for bed and my wife looked out our east facing window and asked what it was.  The light was like a flare, then burnt out into a small white light and continued to the horizon.  Moving WSW to ENE. I got a very short video of the last second and the bright burn and you can't see the small white light on the video. It was most likely space junk burning up.
