Boomerang shaped craft over Miamisburg Ohio;1987-06-18 23:15:00;1hr30min+;Boomerang shaped craft over Miamisburg Ohio The Sighting occured in the late evening. It began on our way home from work, approximately 11:15-11:30. We noticed this bright object in the sky, looked much like Venus does, but for June 1987, Venus was in the W Elongation, what we saw was in the SouthWest sky(we were heading south)We were both just out of the AF after spending time in Europe. We were familiar with quite a few aircraft. This craft was much different though. We watched it as we drove home, we arrived at 11:40-11:50,we went inside and continued to watch it from a bedroom window, it appeared to be moving so we went back outside. It approached and went directly over our heads. Once it passed over, we realized that it was very quiet No dogs, no crickets  not a sound. This was in the country and there were always night noises....Not this time. As for the craft, it was boomerang shaped (Drawing on the way, in the mail)there were lights in the front and on the bottom, all different colors, the structure appeared to be a brushed chrome. The lights in the front were seperated to the point they almost looked like a car radiator. Judging size was quite difficult, but i know it was huge, it also looked close enough to hit with a stone, as it passed over, the lights on the rear appeared to pulsate, as smooth as a heartbeat, as one went off the other came on The craft itself was silent, not even the swishing of air, nothing. We called Wright Patt Air Base, which is about 18 miles north and they told us there was  nothing on their scopes, but if they heaard, they would call us back. Our no. at that time was 513-((number deleted)), for those of you who would like to check records;39.6319999999997;-84.2634000000001
Miamisburg UFO Triangular White light hovering air craft spotted on Soldiers Home Miamisburg Rd.;2009-09-12 11:00:00;10 minutes;Miamisburg UFO Triangular White light hovering air craft spotted on Soldiers Home Miamisburg Rd. Approximately 11:30 p.m. on September 12, 2009.  Myself 36 year old mother & wife, my husband 38 year old Home Improvement business man, and our son 15 year old skater/student was on our way home driving down Soldiers Home Miamisburg Rd. South when we spotted a ufo hovering above a corn field seemingly still.  It was wide with 2 big head lights and was low enough that we couldn't see under it until we got under it and behind it.  We had the windows down and the sun roof open and it had no sound.  We then seen it was shaped as a triangle with white lights on each point.  It began to move as we got past it, I turned around down the street and it was still in our sights it began accelerating faster & faster as if it was running away from us.  Once we hit a tree line and couldnâ€™t see it for approximately 8 seconds, we seen the sky again, but it was GONE.  It was a clear night with many stars in the sky.  And it was hovering over a corn field close to the old Ga! tor alley ball field on Farmersville West Carrollton Rd.;39.6319999999997;-84.2634000000001
