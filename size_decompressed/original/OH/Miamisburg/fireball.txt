As it was falling four about 1 minute, the fireball went out, like a comet that fizzled, then it reappeared and separated into 3-4 separate lights that hovered and then were in a line formation that slowly all together descended until you could not see them below the treeline horizon.;39.6319999999997;-84.2634000000001
Strange fireball object that never burned out.;2018-12-25 01:00:00;00:07;Strange fireball object that never burned out. As I walked outside to get something from my truck, I saw a bright red fireball looking craft traveling SW, it looked like a craft, but on fire.  It had no trail, it didnâ€™t burn up or dissipate.  It continued to travel away from me, getting smaller.   Definitely not an asteroid, comet or like object entering the atmosphere.  Rather large considering its distance.  It had a red glow with what looked like fire above it.;39.6319999999997;-84.2634000000001
