12 red orbs/spheres  over Wellsville, Ohio, skies.;2014-05-24 22:20:00;10 minutes;12 red orbs/spheres  over Wellsville, Ohio, skies. My husband and I were just coming home from walmart, when I got out of the car and said to him:  Oh my God look up in the sky, what I saw was unbelievable, there was 12 orange-red spheres, absolutely no sound, they were in a semi-circle pattern and at his time I ran to get my neighbor so she could look at these.  At this time they broke apart in triangles in groups of three and then as quickly as I was watching these, they started disappearing ,one by one.   Truly unbelievable and very scary.
