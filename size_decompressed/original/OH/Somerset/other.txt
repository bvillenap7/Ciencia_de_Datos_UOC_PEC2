Three cresent red glows in a triangular formation, S.E. traversing 40-45 degrees in 4-5 sec. below Orions Belt.;2000-03-23 19:30:00;4-5 sec.;Three cresent red glows in a triangular formation, S.E. traversing 40-45 degrees in 4-5 sec. below Orions Belt. Three cresent red glows in a 120 degree included angle perfect triangular formation, S.E. traversing 40-45 degrees in 4-5 sec. passing below and nearly parallel to Orions Belt.  Width of formation was aprox. 2/3 width of Orions Belt.  Red cresent glows arc length was about 2/5 of full circle.  Distance between such circles was aprox. 3 such circles.  Formation and cresents appeared to be flat as viewed from aprox. 45 degrees below as they passed from my right to my left.  Sky and mind was clear as wife and me did a evening walk down dark alley.  On several past walks I have been quick to point out a shooting star to my wife.  My first split second impression of this (my first ever and likely only ever) siteing was another shooting star.  I was caught completly off guard for what I saw.  As the formation passed mid flight below Orions Belt, I tried to draw my wifes attention to it.  By the time she looked in the right direction, the red cresent glows were fading or cooling away.;39.7941999999999;-82.2992000000002
