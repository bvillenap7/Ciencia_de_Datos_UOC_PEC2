On the night of 6/16/15, at about 22:30 hours, my fiancé and I went outside of our apartment building to smoke a cigarette.  I looked up at the stars like I usually do looking for satellites and other astronomical features.   This night I noticed a bright single light in the evening sky.  I was looking east slightly northeast.  I realized it was a different light than is in that part of the sky this time of year.  I pointed it out to my fiancé and we both watched it as it moved slowly, almost floating but steadily to the south southeast. As it moved, I looked for any lights that would be on an aircraft, i.e., beacon strobe, red and green lights on the wings.  I figured if it was heading away from us we would not see the bright landing light if it were a plane.  In my opinion as a private pilot, the object was at least three to five thousand feet in the air and I believe it wasn’t an airplane or other typical aircraft. As we watched the object move away from us, it all of a sudden vanished.  We were amazed and awestruck that it disappeared so quickly.   Neither one of us has ever seen anything like this before and hopes this small report may help in the overall investigation of UFOs.;41.6429;-83.4719
