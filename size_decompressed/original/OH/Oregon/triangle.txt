Dark triangular object spotted over Oregon, Ohio early morning Nov. 23rd.;2000-11-23 06:30:00;4 minutes;Dark triangular object spotted over Oregon, Ohio early morning Nov. 23rd. I was sitting in my living room Thanksgiving morning watching T.V. when I heard an unusual slow low frequency modulating hum. I looked through the sheer drapes that were closed at the time, and noticed quite a few lights directly east moving northbound. When I parted the drapes I had expected either helicopters or planes, but was stunned by the enormity of the one triangular object that I saw. The object itself was bigger than a football field, had one red light in the bottom middle with smaller white lights in each of the corners, was charcoal grey to black colored, and surrounded by a dull orangy faint glow of some sort. It moved what I consider to be slower than stall speed for an aircraft in a slightly northeastern direction. The height at which it was flying was in my opinion just high enough to clear a radio tower, of which there are several in the direction it was headed. The hum sound it emitted was neither a prop, or jet engine as I am familiar with both of these. I am a 38 year old music teacher, and have programmed sounds on synthesizers regularly, and relate it to a low modulating frequency with a slow sweeping resonance effect. I used up a little time trying to look for a camera, and decided to give up the search for one, and step outside to get a better look.  By the time I was outdoors it took about 20 seconds to disappear over the northeastern neighborhood rooftops. The conditions that morning were overcast, and still dark out at 6:30 a.m., and being right next to an interstate feel that surely someone else might have experienced the same event that morning.;41.6429;-83.4719
