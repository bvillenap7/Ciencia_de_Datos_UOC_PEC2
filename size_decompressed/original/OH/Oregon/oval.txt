I was driving home from my friends house going from Toledo, Ohio to Oregon, Ohio. While crossing the maumee river I saw what looked to possibly be a blimp shape, but it was very brightly lit and it was white and gray in color. A few blinking lights on top and bottom of craft. Flew very slow and low to the ground, maybe 1-2 thousand feet high.;41.6429;-83.4719
