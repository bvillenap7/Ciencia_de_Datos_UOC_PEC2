Red blinking high in the sky leading the way.;1997-09-15 22:00:00;10 minutes;Red blinking high in the sky leading the way. On the way home from a weekly meeting on a Wednesday evening (9/15/75 is the closest I can come to the date) I observed a red blinking light which appeared to be leading the way or protecting me.  It darted around high in the sky at about 75 degrees. It moved quickly and lasted for about 10 minutes. It happened every week for as long as I traveled that way (about 2 months). I have a BA in psychology and minor in economics and have worked in aerospace. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.9544;-84.3199000000002
A bright ball of light slowly moved across the sky for 30 seconds and disappeared.;2011-10-22 21:15:00;30 seconds;A bright ball of light slowly moved across the sky for 30 seconds and disappeared. My husband and I observed a bright white ball of light in the sky for about 30 seconds. It slowly moved across the sky and disappeared. We know it was not a plane because it was not flashing and it was too high. It looked like it disappeared into space. It looked like it got brighter and dimmer as it moved across the sky, but it was not flashing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
