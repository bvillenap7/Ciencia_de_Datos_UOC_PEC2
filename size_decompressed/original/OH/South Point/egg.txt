A large, silent, matte silver object appeared in our view approx. 200ft. in sky.  Hovered stationary and then moved very quickly away. It made a triangular pattern over the Ohio River and then went out of view. I described the object as egg shaped but in reality it was more like a large, blunt-tipped diamond shape.  We both agree on the events as they occurered, but my co-worker refuses to discuss the incident.  I remember us talking that day in amazement that no one was pulled off the road gaping at the object as it was quite large and mesmerizing. The object was matte silver, almost like pewter.  There was a glint from the sun but we could not see any features on the object.  It moved away so quickly that I did not notice it was moving, only getting harder to see.  We both agree that we had never seen anything like this before and that there was no easy explanation for it.  Another thing we thought strange was the time of day - around 1:00 pm, on a beautiful sunny day.  We are both social workers who work with troubled youth.  One last detail, I experienced no fear when viewing the object but weeks afterward became very fearful and paranoid about ufo's, aliens, etc.  (This is definitely NOT a typical baseline ideation for me!)Partially, this effect is still present which is why I don't think I can provide any contact information.;38.4376;-82.5547
