Dark spinning object seen after seeing 5 orange globes.;2013-10-04 20:10:00;20 minutes;Dark spinning object seen after seeing 5 orange globes. I am a 59 years old, a wife, mother, grandmother and a registered nurse.   I was in my back yard about 8:10 pm watering my flowers I noticed in the sky two very bright orange globes.  I thought at first it was perhaps small planes but, then both objects hovered in the sky for a few seconds then both started to fly away in different directions the first one went over head the second to the east as they flew upward they then seemed to disappear from sight.  By this time both my son and my grandson were in the yard with me and saw the objects as well.   About 3 minutes later another orange globe light appeared low in the sky and then flew in the same pattern but did flew more quickly up in to the sky and then vanished from sight.   We did get a short video of the 3rd one on the IPhone.   About 10 minutes later we were sitting on the back patio and saw 2 more orange globes that quickly disappeared in the sky.   About 60 seconds later my son looked and saw a dark spinning circle shaped object.  He alerted us (myself and grandson, 5 years old) we both looked up and saw a dark object that appeared to be black and gray.  The object appeared to be spinning and  very quiet.  We watched it for about 30 seconds then we could not see it any more.  We were very excited.  Our dog was going crazy.   Thank you very much for listening.
