Looked like a large meteor or space junk re-entry.;1999-11-16 19:08:00;20 sec;Looked like a large meteor or space junk re-entry. I am a network engineer/administrator for the US Army Corps of Engineers. I was leaving my parents' home at about 19:08 when I saw what appeared to be a meteor or space junk re-entry. There was a large object with a thin white to red to blue trail following. When I first saw it I was facing NNE and the object was traveling left to right, just to the right of my center of vision at about 30 to 40 degrees elevation. The object travelled in a north-easterly direction and broke up into about 4 pieces that stayed along the same path as all of them faded into darkness. I heard all of the hullabaloo on WLW AM 700 in Cincinnati and later on the Art Bell show on AM 1100 from Cleveland and I was kind of surprised. Yes the object was large and it headed in the opposite direction of where you would expect a leonid meteor to come from, but it didn't exhibit any non-ballistic or unexplainable motion. I have been interestested in UFO's and astronomy since I was very young and I have seen many more spectacular meteor events than the one on 11/16/99. I am sure that it was a meteor.;38.4376;-82.5547
