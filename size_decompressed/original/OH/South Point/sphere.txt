It does drop behind the western horizon later in the evening.  PD)) the object had a bright white center and a weblike bright white formed structure forming the bottom, could not be a star because it van i was feeding the dogs in the back yard. the sky was clear and the stars were shining brightly, i then noticed a very bright star in the southwest sky. i went into the house and got my binoculars, told my wife that i was going out to look at this bright star.  it was the most unusual thing i have ever seen. at first it just looked like a regular star but when i focused more closely i could see that it looked like a white center with a web like structure forming a ball of light under and around the formed structure.  when i focused the binoculars to the right it seemed to change shape and looked as if it had crater-like structure. my wife then looked and saw the smae thing but she described it more as a ball with a bright center and the web like lines comming from the bottom forming a circle.  our son also saw it but did not see what we saw due to the fact he did not have his glasses on and he was in a hurry to go out. this is very hard to describe and we are not some nuts out looking for ET but we did see something very strange.  what happen in the next half our was what was really strange.  about 9 pm i went back out to look at the star again, it had disappeared! the sky was still clear as a bell but the star was totally gone. my wife and i both looked the sky over no sign at all.  now maybe it was a star and it fell from the sky but i do not think so.  thank you for listening.;38.4376;-82.5547
