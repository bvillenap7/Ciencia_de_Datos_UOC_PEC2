Craft hoverd overhead for at least 20 min.  It made no sound.  Triangle shaped with 4 lights on the bottom, one at each triangle point.  One light in the middle.  This thing was huge, at least as big as a footballfield.  I'm not really sure how long we watched it.  But when it took off it whent straight up, until it was only a speck in the sky and shot off at a right angle.  It was the biggest thing I've, ever seen.  When it was overhead it completley blocked out the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.4706;-83.8853
