Dark square object with red light flying at a low altitude, high speed and no sound.;2012-03-19 19:30:00;1-2 minutes;Dark square object with red light flying at a low altitude, high speed and no sound. Sitting in a parking lot with two friends, we noticed a dark colored, square looking object moving at a rapid, yet steady speed.  On the bottom of the object, a red/orange solid light.  It did not flicker like a flame, remaining the same throughout the sighting.   Although moving at a rapid pace, there was no noise produced.  It appeared to be too low for a plane, but too high for a remotely driven object.  It did not spin, remaining level and proceeding rapidly.  We watched until it disappeared behind the trees.  I did not get a picture, for my phone has too low resolution and capability for smaller object that high up.  It did not hesitate or leave a trail. There were trails of jets flying at a much higher altitude above it.;41.1235999999999;-83.1818999999998
