I was in my car heading north on my drive in to work at 6:30am and saw one bright star to the north/northwest in the sky.  No other stars were visible since there was quite a bit of daylight.  The light was whitish blue and flickered, grew about twice the original size, then just disappeared instantly. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible flare from an Iridium satellite?
