Shining object stationary in the sky over Northwestern Ohio.;2008-05-28 17:30:00;5 Min;Shining object stationary in the sky over Northwestern Ohio. While watching races at a track meet on a crystal clear blue day, something shiny in the northwest sky caught my eye because it was the only thing in the sky at that sime.  It appeared to either be a silver object very far away relecting the sunlight, or perhaps a plane with its landing light strongly shining in my direction.  The object appeared from my perspective to be stationary in the sky at about 20 degrees above the horizon.  I assumed is was a plan eith traveling toward me (explaining the landing/running lights shining brightly) or it was traveling away from me.  Either way, it appeared to be still in the sky from my vantage.  I watched it between races at the meet for 3 - 4 minutes, just thinking about what it could be.  (Some track meets are boring.)  When the next 100 meter ruace began, I watched the race, then looked back at the spot in the sky where I had seen the reflection just 30 seconds before.  Nothing was there.  No relection, no lights, nothing.  I continued to search above the spot, below, right and left.  Nothing.  No trees were obstructing my view I was looking across the spur of the track marking the spot of the object above some natural landmarks on the horizon. It would have been near Toledo, Ohio or Findlay, Ohio possibly.  If anyone else saw something, I did too. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

fiery looking object moved across the sky;2010-07-04 21:15:00;less than a minute;fiery looking object moved across the sky It looked to be an airplane on fire, but no smoke.  It traveled in a straight line, I'm not sure of the direction.  It is interesting to note that about 1.5 hrs later we saw it again on the same path.  Also, please note the times are approximate.
