These were in the shapes of orange balls, and would slowly turn red.  They would fly in a pattern of 2 or 3 over the horizon.  They would go vertical, and sometimes in a horizontal pattern.  There would be 5 or 6 in the sky, turn right shoot up in the sky and disappear.  Then a couple more would come up out of the horizon and repeat the same pattern, and I know for sure it was not an airplane because we were next to an airport and heard a plane take off.  These were quiet and too close together to taxi that close together.  Then looking up into the sky directly above us were com trails from an airliner.  These were like nothing I have ever seen, and had no sound and moved beyond any speed in the sky that I have ever seen.;41.1235999999999;-83.1818999999998
