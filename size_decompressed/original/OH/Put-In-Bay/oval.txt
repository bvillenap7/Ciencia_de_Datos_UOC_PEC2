While camping at South Bass Island State Park, better known as Put-In Bay Island in Northwest Ohio, with my wife, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law we were sitting around the campfire talking.  In truth I had drank three beers over the course of the night so, yes I had drank alcohol, but no I was far from drunk.  The weather was clear. I was looking eastward while everyone else was looking towards me. I was looking out and suddenly a blue-green oval light passed out from behind a stand of trees in to a clear patch of sky.  It looked to be about the size of a diner plate from my point of view.  I would say the angle was about 60 degrees.  There was no sound. It moved for a couple seconds and then seemed to disappear as if it was moving fast away. I do not believe we have been visited by intelligent life from another planet and it requires evidence to convince me otherwise however, I do not know what it is I saw.;41.6553;-82.8209
