Follow up to prior report.;2015-07-04 20:00:00;20 minutes;Follow up to prior report. This is a follow up from my prior report posted. I saw a mention of Chinese lanterns and never heard of them, so did the homework.  I found youtubes of them. On one hand what we saw could maybe be Chinese lanterns BUT, it was a still night. Little to no winds.  The size of what we say would have had to be very BIG Chinese lanterns.  What we saw proceeded from south to north, other north to south, one headed east.  Wind currents would have carried Chinese lanterns all the same direction and speed.  It could be said that at a distance the slow depletion of the fuel cell as it dimmed and extinguished itself could appear to be confused as speed.   BUT, four of these remained brilliant AND traveled at high speed.   Two of what we saw disappeared but then reappeared.  I don't think that Chinese lanterns fuel cells when extinguished have igniters to relight themselves.  None that I have found available.  None flickered.;40.599;-81.5388
