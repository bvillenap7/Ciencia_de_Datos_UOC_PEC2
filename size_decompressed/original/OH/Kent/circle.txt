I started to look and did not see anything but a plane that looked a little low for how big of a plane it was when i notice a fire like object that was traveling east kinda like a stop and go motion.  It was going east and went in 90 degree angle to the west and then went back east until it disappeared   At first i thought it could have been a plane on fire until people was saying that there was five of them . The color was like the color of fire but with green .;41.1413078085638;-81.3444962216618

Moved from East to North West.  No sound moved for a period of time then stopped.  Went to different vantage point and it stopped glowing.
