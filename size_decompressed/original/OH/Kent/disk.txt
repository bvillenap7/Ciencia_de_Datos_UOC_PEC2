large disc shaped metalic craft, hoverd and moved with no sound in August 1974;1974-08-15 07:00:00;3-4 minutes;large disc shaped metalic craft, hoverd and moved with no sound in August 1974 The sighting occurred in either August or Sept of 1974 during late summer session at college.   I was a student at Kent State University and on my way to a late class, but it was still quite light outside since it was summer, so our view was clear.  I was walking across an open field on a well traveled path between buildings.  There were between 5-7 other people on the path.   Someone pointed to the sky and we all saw a large metalic disc.  I knew we were all seeing the same thing because we were verifying what we were seeing at the time.  It was very slow moving, clearing the treetops but not extremely high in the sky and easy to view.  It had a row of what could be decribed as windows or a variation across the middle.  I doubt they were windows, but I describe it this way to try to explain a different looking type of material around the middle area.  It moved silently and finally out of sight in about a 3 - 4 minutes period of time. We all just stood there transfixed, but verifying the details for eath other.  I remember looking at my watch to verify the time.  After it was out of sight, I continued toward my class and I remember saying to another person walking beside me...You know, no one will ever believe us when we talk about this... and no one ever has.    I remember these details well, as I wrote them all down at the time later that evening and drew a picture of the craft in a journal which I had for many years but have since lost. I only regret I did not get anyone else's address or name.  At the time I thought, well this will all be clear to everyone soon... now it is almost 30 years later.  I guess I miscalculated...

Kent, OH:  I was outside late in the evening with my dog on April 16, 2008, when I looked up in the sky (it was very clear) and immediately noticed a fast moving circular object with several colored lights all around the outside moving in a straight line and then seemed to zig-zag as I lost sight of it.  I called for my husband to come outside to see it and he caught a quick glimpse too.  It didn't make any sound that I could hear and was out of sight in seconds.  Because of the extremely fast speed, I am sure it was not an airplane or helicopter.  I am a long-time employee at a local university and wish I had an explanation of what I saw since it was a very unusual experience!;41.1413078085638;-81.3444962216618
