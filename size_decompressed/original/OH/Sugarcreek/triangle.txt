3 large triangular aircraft in the skies over Sugarcreek, OH;2008-01-15 01:00:00;15 minutes;3 large triangular aircraft in the skies over Sugarcreek, OH It was early January and my boyfriend was taking me home after watching a movie at his house.  We were passing through Sugarcreek on our way to Bellbrook (my home town) when we saw the strangest aircraft in the sky.   It was large, black and triangular with one white light on each point.  It seemed to be hovering nearby.  It made an odd humming noise and was able to move very slowly.   We pulled over to watch it and two others appeared in the distance, moving incredibly fast and moving in ways that you would not expect of an aircraft.  In fact, their movements struck me as being completely unnatural.   Even now I cannot conceive of how anything man-made could move in such a way. I looked at the clock. It said 1:40 am. There was no mechanical interference and we didn’t lose time.  My Boyfriend and I have always been fascinated by stories of encounters with UFO’s though neither of us had ever seen one before that night.   I still see them in that area every now and then, late at night.;40.5179;-81.6569
