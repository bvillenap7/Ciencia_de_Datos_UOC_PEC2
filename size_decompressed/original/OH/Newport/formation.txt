Pink Phoenix Lights type grouping;2008-06-20 22:45:00;45 seconds;Pink Phoenix Lights type grouping Was riding with a friend north on St Rt 66 towards Fort Loramie, Ohio. Noticed pinkish lights â€“ four in a formation similar to the phoenix lights.  One light was the point wedge shape had two lights on one side and one light on the other.   We pulled over the car as they slowly blinked out one after the other from East to West.  They did not return from what we could see.   The night remained mostly clear with stars visible and much smaller than the pink colored lights.;39.3943;-81.2376
