It came down very fast and stopped, hovering in front of my car over the road. It took up the whole road, and my car stopped so that I couldn't move ahead. When it got down to the road in front of me, it then look like a saucer shape with very bright lights all around. I think I was momentarily in shock. I screamed, but noone heard or saw me. The houses around were dark like noone was home. I yelled can anyone see this or hear me, but noone was there. It hovered in front of me, but I don't no how long since I seemed to be in some state of shock. And then it took off into the sky very, very, fast in a zig zag fashion and disappeared into the horizon. I didn't tell anyone but my family about it. I was afraid that people would think I was crazy, so I tried to forget about it and thats why I am not positive on the date except that I think it was around Halloween sometime in October in the 70's, and there were other sitings around the same time.;39.1936999999999;-84.7340000000003
