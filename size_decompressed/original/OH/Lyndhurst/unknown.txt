At 21:30 Feb 15, 1995, heard and felt loud, rumbling roar, like a jet.  Nearby small airport has planes usually flying nearby, thought it was one of them.  Roaring became louder and sustained over three minutes, so looked out West window.  Sky was overcast.  Observed three blue-white strobing lights similar to aircraft strobs in the following positions, indicated by an astriks and periods.    *      .                .   The top left light would strobe or blink and the two bottom lights would blink off, then they in turn would blink while the top left would be off.  The sequence repeated in regular cycles of approximately one second.The window was opend.  Tempeture was near 25 degrees.  Roaring sound could be heard comming from the direction of the lights.  Secon witness was called (wife) who watched for a minute, commented that that can't be a plane since it was not moving.  In fact, lights were stationary.  Got out 7x35 binoculars but could not detect any observable shape.  Distance from one light on left to one on right was eight inches at arms length with naked eye.  Brillance of light was similar to venus and hour after sunset. As I watched, noticed lights seemed to be drifting due west.  Continued watching for nine minutes  as they indeed moved away at an incredably slow speed.  Just before dissapearing behind foortops in the distance, noticed the top left light drift or rotate towards the center light, then slightly back.  Then lights were out of sight. Third witness , 83 year old mother, heard loud roar and went from window to window.  She lives 4 miles due west.  She is hard of hearing but thought a truck was outside or something. Called Cuyahoga county airport at 22:30 to ask if any military craft was in the area, negitive response.  Called Cleveland Hopkins airport tower and received same respose, but was advised to call FAA the next day. Called FAA on 2-16-95 sometime in the late morning and reported what was seen.  Woman at FAA stated similar report had come in early that AM from Huron, Ohio where man reported fighter aircraft had been so loud and low that it broke several of his windows. Nothing ever turned up in local news.;41.4951000000001;-81.4657000000005

This did not suprise us as an airport is nearby, and similar jet sounds are heard from time to time.  However, this sound continued well into three minutes, getting louder and louder, unlike any plane that passes by.  I looked out the westeren window of my family room and saw three blue-white strobing lights about 30 degrees above the horizon,  in a pattern which I will represent with an astrix and two periods:                   (     *    .                 .       )       The lower two lights would strobe together while the upper left light was off, then the upper left would strobe while the lower two were off, doing so within one second intervals. The sky was grey overcast, tempeture about 23 degrees.  I then noticed that the lights were stationary.  At arms length, the length of the formation was  approximatelly eight inches.  I called my wife in to view the lights. She agreed that they did not look li! ke any plane she ever saw before,  and why was it stationary?  I opened the window and noted that the roaring noise was comming directly from the object, but there were no visable exhust jets or any obvious source for the soise.  Through 7x35 binoculars,  the lights appeared similar to aircraft strobe lights, but very intense.  No shape or outline of any kind was detected.   As I watched,  the formation  seemed to be moving extremely slowly to the west, at a speed of perhaps only a few feet per second, barely noticable.  I watched for 9 minutes before it dissapeared behind the rooftops.  Just before it did, the light on the left moved or rotated towards the center light, almost merging, then returned to its original position.                                                                                                    I imimediately called the Cuyohoga county airport tower, (i had the number due to other problems) and asked if any military craft were in the area, or a blimp, or anything like that.  The reply was negitive.  I called Cleveland Hopkins airport and obtaind the same comment, but they recommended I contact the FAA the next day.  This I did, and the woman on the phone who took my report stated that a man had called in from Huron Ohio that same morning to report a jet that had been so low and loud, it brook several windows. Huron is due west from my home if you draw a line to it, and this was the direction the lights headed.  My mother also heard the roar, and, although hard of hearing, went from window to window looking for a truck or something, but never looked up.  She lives directly west of us on the same line.  We are self employed professionals, and I am an armchair astronomer and avaition buff, so I am fimiliar with various types of craft and celestial events.  This did not match any known objects or! vehicles.  Nothing was reported in the news.;41.4951000000001;-81.4657000000005

This past Tuesday, my wife and I AGAIN heard the same loud, rumbling roar that we heard in 1995. It shakes the house, startles the cats and lasts far longer than a jet plane passing overhead.   I searched the overcast skies, same as in 95, but didn't see anything.   In 95, three strobing  lights in an elongated triangle were observed in the western sky, about 40 degrees off the horizon above my neighbor's house.  They remained motionless for almost eight minutes, then began to slowly move west.   The FAA received reports from Huron Ohio, due west of here, and there were multiple sightings in Michigan.   I report this recent SOUND event because there may be others in the area the saw something as well.;41.4951000000001;-81.4657000000005
