It was approaching on an East to West line, and went directly overhead. The initial flash turned out to be some form of disk, which wavered on its course, reflecting sunlight as it dipped and wobbled.  At arms length, it was only the size of a small thumb tack, but the wavering motion clearly suggested a disk shape.  It had no lights, tail, wings or contrail.  It was silent, and crossed a 160 degree arc under 10 seconds, faster than commerical aircraft.  It lookedd very much like similar video sightings taken England when one passed over a tractor in a field.;41.4951000000001;-81.4657000000005
