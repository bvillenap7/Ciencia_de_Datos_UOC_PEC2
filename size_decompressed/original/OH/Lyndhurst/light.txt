Bright, color changing first magnitude object hovers and dances for half an hour;2004-09-18 03:00:00;30 minutes;Bright, color changing first magnitude object hovers and dances for half an hour Saw a bright venus like object in the west, north west at 40 degrees.  It caught my eye because it moved to and fro, darting at times behid trees.  There was no wind, no clouds, just clear skys.  The bright object emmited colors of red, green and white.  I have waited until today to report because I had hoped to see a planet or star in the same position on the following nights, but that was not the case.  In fact, I saw the same light in the northern sky, at 22:00 hourst tonight.  Same bright, color changing light, moving and swaying around and around.  These objects are of the first magnitude.  No sounds, electrical problems or other related phenomena. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness was observing the very bright star, seen currently in the western sky during the evenings.  PD));41.4951000000001;-81.4657000000005
