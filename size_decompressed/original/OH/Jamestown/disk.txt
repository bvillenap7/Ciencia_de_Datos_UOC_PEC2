Below the saucer up in front of it was a red crop duster aircraft. The plane was moving at a normal pace and probably did not see the saucer above and behind the plane.  I ran in the house to my basement to get my camera.  It took me maybe 30 seconds to find camera and run to the back door.  Looked up and saucer was in back yard.  Almost like it was waiting on me.  I had my camera so I lifted camera up to take picture.  While doing this I was so ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.6466;-83.7514

The plane was moving at a normal pace and probably did not see the saucer above and behind the plane.  I ran in the house to my basement to get my camera.  It took me maybe 30 seconds to find camera and run to the back door.  Looked up and saucer was sky in back yard.  Almost like it was waiting on me.  I had my camera so I lifted camera up to take picture.  While doing this I was started cursing the object. I got you, nothing you can do about it.  I am going to get all the proof I need.  The object started to change shapes while I was looking through the view finder.  The end of object started to look like the tail of a plane.  So I lowered the camera to get a better look.  The silver saucer completely disappeared.  Not one cloud in the sky and completely beautiful blue skies! .  Looked around for saucer to see if it might reappear.  No such luck.  Highly disappointed that I did not get a picture of the saucer.  If I get another chance I will be using video mode.  It was as if the craft has changed dimensions.  like changing frequencies morphing and disappearing.;39.6466;-83.7514
