Red pulsating light moving south....;2012-07-11 00:00:00;2 minutes;Red pulsating light moving south.... Waiting in the valley view Cinema parking lot to pick up my son and his friend, I was smoking a cigarette and staring at the sky.  Clear night and no clouds in site. I noticed a red light heading south from north east sky.  At first I thought a helicopter but not a plane.  The light was pulsating though. Not blinking.  Strange, I thought. I continued watching it head south (towards me) and the pulsating red light was bigger than before as it was getting closer.  After about a minute, it stopped and continued to pulsate and then changed direction slightly and started heading south west.  Now it was on my left side as I was watching it.  It's speed seemed consistent like it was in cruise control.  Towards the end of my siting, a sort of red pointy tail of light appeared on the main pulsating red light... it suddenly came again to a dead stop, pulsating and just blinked out.  Vanished.  All I could see were stars and dark sky.  It was strange and fascinating, indeed! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.4344;-81.6373
