formation of 5 or 6 lights traveling at great speed;2007-05-08 21:30:00;20 seconds;formation of 5 or 6 lights traveling at great speed It was approximately 9:30 p.m.  I was leaving a local gas station/plaza parking lot (Boardman and North Lima border area) when I noticed a row of 5 or 6 lights in the sky.  Thinking this was just a little odd to be just a plane, I then took a second look.  It was moving slow and I was waiting for a better view (a tree was blocking my view).  I immediately thought this was peculiar because first, the lights were not blinking, as you would expect to view on a plane, second, the lights appeared much larger than lights are seen on a plane.  The lights were white (the same color hue as headlights on a car (not bright white but more whitish-yellow but still very bright), they were in a completely straight horizontal row.  I assume the lights were on one object as I could not be sure due to the night sky.  In addition, I would like to note that there was no apparent noise from the object as you would expect to hear from a plane. Next, this is what startled me most.  As I left the parking lot, I was traveling south and noticed the lights were now traveling in the same direction at great speed.  I stopped my car to view and noticed the lights were now traveling vertically but still in the same southern direction as I first noticed and then suddenly out of view.  (out of view perhaps from the intense speed).  I never saw a plane travel that fast across the sky. I came home and immediately explained what I saw to my husband.  Whether this was a UFO or just a plane, it was definitely an odd experience and hope it can be explained.  I am wondering if anyone else in the area viewed the same lights.;40.9674;-80.652
