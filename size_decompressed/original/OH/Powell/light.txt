Four orange lights over Powell, Ohio;2011-06-04 09:45:00;1 minute;Four orange lights over Powell, Ohio I and another person in my apartment complex saw four orange lights fly out of the northwest in a southeasterly direction.   As the lights moved, the intensity and color shifted and changed somewhat.   Each light remained visible for less than 1 minute and then faded from view.   They flew in a line and disappeared one by one.  There was a lot of ambient noise, so I'm not sure if the low buzzing I heard was coming from them or not.  The Memorial Tournament is currently going on - could it have been news aircraft going home for the night?;40.1834000000006;-83.0912000000008
A line of at least 7 points of light moving from southwest to northeast over Ohio 1930 hrs 3-7-2020  ((Spacelink satellites));2020-03-07 19:30:00;5 minutes;A line of at least 7 points of light moving from southwest to northeast over Ohio 1930 hrs 3-7-2020 I was standing in my driveway just north of Powell Ohio around 7:30 pm Saturday, March 7, 2020 looking west at what I think was Venus,  As I watched, a faint point of light appeared just below Venus and moved northeast.  At first I assumed it was a high flying jet, but saw no evidence of contrails or navigation lights.  As I watched the first one, a second appeared in the same place, and followed the first. This sequence continued until there were at least 7 objects, evenly spaced, moving in a line t o the northeast. After 7, my curiosity got the best of me and I came inside to Google the phenomenon, I would have assumed satellites if not for the fact that they seemed to be in formation and in such numbers.  Each object took approximately 30 seconds to cross my plane of view.  I will be watching the news for info.;40.1834000000006;-83.0912000000008
