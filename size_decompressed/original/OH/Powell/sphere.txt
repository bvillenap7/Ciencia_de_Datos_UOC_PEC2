All objects spun in spherical orbits independent of one another. I observed 15 red orange glowing spheres in a cloud formation.  All objects spun in spherical orbits independent of one another.  All objects were observed changing elevation and exchanging positions in no observed pattern within the formation.  I viewed them from the South facing North while they moved in formation East as the size stayed constant they neither grew or shrunk. In the area several cars stopped in the middle of the road and also observed the event.  I viewed a single aircraft believed to be a passenger plane flying the opposite direction below the objects.  The plane was half the distance to the ground that the spheres where, with me looking up at a 70 degree angle.  I believe the objects were at 40,000ft to 60,000ftt if the plane was at 20,000ft or 30,000ft. After a period of about 5 minutes the lights began to flicker out much like if you shut off a light switch.  Some just vanished and other were observed flying off at a high rate of speed in different directions before vanishing.  The order they went out was random within the ever changing cloud.;40.1834000000006;-83.0912000000008
