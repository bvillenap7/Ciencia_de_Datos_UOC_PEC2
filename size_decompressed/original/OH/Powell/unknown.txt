Small Cigar shape object seen traveling a fast rate of speed.;2008-04-30 07:45:00;3minutes;Small Cigar shape object seen traveling a fast rate of speed. I was driving North on Hard Road, as I came to the red light to turn right I saw an object in the sky that I thought at first was a Blimp but it was going to fast and the shape of the object looked like a small fat cigar.  I tried to look for the object once I cleared the trees but it was gone.  The object was a dark color almost a dark brown.  I hope that there were more sightings.;40.1834000000006;-83.0912000000008
