It was right around 5:10 pm on a Monday.  We stopped at a stoplight and saw a hovering bright white light in the sky to the right - west - over State Route 16.   It was daylight out, although it was cloudy.  It was weird - almost impossible - to see such a bright light in the daytime.  I pointed it out to everyone and we were all staring at it.  As we watched, it seemed to turn to the left in mid-air and the light moved over horizontally, kind of like an eclipse and became a silvery dome-shaped object.  I said, Omigod,. did you see that?    We all agreed but then the stoplight turned green and we took off and turned east on the highway.  We couldn't see it anymore, although I continued to look in the sideview mirror and out at the sky.  I've never seen anything else like that in my life.;40.0768;-82.5219
