After the turn it seemed to be moveing normally and then it would hop. eventually it passed out of site. the weirdist thing about it was the hopping, and the lights. red blue green white. i only saw three points of light on it but it was flashing in what i could imagne was some sort of pattern. however at the time it seemed random. that was it, a hopping, disk shaped opject that made no sound and had flashing lights.;40.0768;-82.5219
