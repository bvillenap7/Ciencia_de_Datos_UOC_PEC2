This object suddenly stopped a remained motionless for a minute. A second object traveling in the same direction stopped next to the first object. They remained there for several minutes. Then the first object started up and continued west to east. The second object waited what seemed to be a few seconds and then continued west to east. These objects were very bright but were easy on the eyes. They traveled much faster then commercial airlines at about two-thousand feet. There was no sound--------- ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) this is response to your questions regarding my previous letter witnesses-1                                                            objects-2                                                             size-the end of an eraser head held at arms length                    how far across the sky they traveled-these objects were moving at least three times the speed of commercial craft but they stopped on a dime.

It just appeared, seemed to hover for a second, then dove towards the earth , diving at a 45 degree angle.  At first it appeared just as white light, as it was descending, I could see green light as well. It descended behind the tree line.;40.0768;-82.5219
