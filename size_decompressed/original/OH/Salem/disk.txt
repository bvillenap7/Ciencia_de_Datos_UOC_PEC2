She didn't see anything at the time, but when she got the pictures back from being developed on December 31,2001, a saucer shaped object could be seen in one of the photos. This object was in the foreground with a tree line as the background. I scanned the picture as a jpeg file (it will be emailed to you). I have a print of the picture. I can make you a print if you would like one;40.8968000000002;-80.8615000000003
