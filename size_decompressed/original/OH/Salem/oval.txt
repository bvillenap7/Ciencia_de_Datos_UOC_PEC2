2 oval orange objects parallel then converging then disappearing after 45-60 seconds;2009-06-26 00:00:00;45 seconds;2 oval orange objects parallel then converging then disappearing after 45-60 seconds ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL SOURCE OF REPORT)) Mr. Davenport  I do not know what happened to my e-mail to you but I am forwarding information to you in this format.  This sighting is one of the most unnerving experiences my wife and I have ever had.  I was a private pilot fo 14 years and never saw any image such as we saw that evening when I did night flying.  The dual objects appeared to be at 35 degrees off horizon.  At first I thought it was one object, probably a plane but if that were the case it why did it have orange balls on its wing tips instead of the traditional green and red wing lighting?   The object was approaching us heading southbound and we were facing true north. Intially it appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, 4-5 miles from us.  I cannot estimate the altitude but I'm guessing 3000-5000 feet.After 30 seconds of from first spotting, what I thought was one object turned out to be two.  One orange ball on our right started to lose altitude and converge toward the other orange glowing ball.  It  the turned sharply to our right away from the other ball and disappeared. Just prior to doing this it appeared to us that both orange objects appeared to stop in mid air.  About 10-15 seconds after the first disappearance, the remaining orange ball vanished.  I would say our entire viewing was 1-1/2 minutes. Upon returning to our home in about 5 minutes I called our local Salem Ohio police department and recounted this experience to them.
