So about ten minutes later a bright light shines down on us so we looked up at the source and here is an aircraft about 50 feet above us that is maybe about the size of a football field and a half and it looked like it was made out of metal rods and had about three different inclosers and the spot light on the bottom so it stayed there for about five minutes stupid us didn't have a camamera or anything to take a picture and then it took off at a high rate of speed. What was weird about it was there were no noise from the thing and it wasn't a blimp either I am sure of that. I do live in Arizona  now that was 3yrs ago;40.8968000000002;-80.8615000000003
