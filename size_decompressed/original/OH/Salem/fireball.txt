a orange fire ball moved acrossed the night sky in N.E. Ohio;2011-08-22 21:45:00;three to five min.;a orange fire ball moved acrossed the night sky in N.E. Ohio Object was a orange in color moving slowly to the south southeast and between 500 and 1000 feet . Size was small and looked to be like a large beach ball . It had a pulsing to it.  I had time to have the wife come out and see it then go back in for the camera and got three shots on it before it went out of my sight.  Estimated speed was maybe around 20 MPH or less.  IT made no sound as it passed over .;40.8968000000002;-80.8615000000003
Three round orange lights flying very close together;2011-09-17 18:30:00;3-4 minutes;Three round orange lights flying very close together Just before 8:30pm on September 17, 2011 in Northeast Ohio my husband and my husband and I saw three round, orange bright lights in the sky.  It was nighttime.  There was no sound.  They were moving about the speed of a small plane.  One was leading and the other two were following and they were side by side.  The two in the back seemed to be very close to each other.  One of the orange bright lights in the back turned and went in the opposite direction.  The bright light started pulsating and then faded out.  The other one in the back started doing the same thing within a minute two (pulsating until the bright orange light faded out).  The one in the lead was very bright for a few more minutes and then it started pulsating and then faded out and we could no longer see any lights.;40.8968000000002;-80.8615000000003
