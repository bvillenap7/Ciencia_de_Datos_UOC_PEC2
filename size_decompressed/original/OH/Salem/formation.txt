Then as I reached in my pocket for the car keys something caught my attention, at first I thought it might be a shooting star, but then I quickly realized from the shapes and movements that they had to be something else.  I watched two dome shaped yellowish-white lights move across the sky in a north east direction, each moving back and forth but continuing forward.  The lights did not blink like an airplane's or were small and bright like the rescue helicopters that fly to the hospital nearby, the lights were constant yet large and dim, pointing straight down.  I wasn't able to see if their was any other shapes that they might have been ommitting from, my only assumption is that they were two separate units flying together.  I was initial shocked to look up and see such a thing happenin! g right here in my home town.  What solidifies my conclusion that they definitely UFO's, is that for the low altitute, roughly 150ft above the ground, their was absolutely no sound at all.  If they were planes or helicopters it would have been load enough to hear.  I sorry I don't have any more info.  I simply stood in amazement and watch until the objects continued out of sight.;40.8968000000002;-80.8615000000003
