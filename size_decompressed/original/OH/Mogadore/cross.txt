cross shaped lights in erratic flight pattern;2008-06-15 21:45:00;5-10 seconds;cross shaped lights in erratic flight pattern My husband and I were lying in bed last night around 9:45 in the evening. My bed and my sleeping side are right next to the window, which at the time was wide open. Out of the corner of my eye I could see lights moving. Just like the posting from Barberton, Ohio I also live very near an airport as well as several smaller airports, the blimp hanger and an army arsenal. At any given time there is something flying over our home and we’ve become quite immune to lights and loud jet engines. However what caught my eye was the erratic flight pattern. I immediately told my husband to turn off the T.V. so I could hear the plane. As stated before we have become immune to planes overhead but have also established a very discerning ear to plane types and sizes. My husband then looked out the window and was as startled by the lights as I was. They seem to be moving slowly back and forth in a weaving pattern and eventually moved in closer. I would say within a mile from us. His words word “what the @#%$ is that?”   The lights were in a cross pattern with several down the middle and two to three running left to right. I can only remember the lights being white and thought to myself this is unlike any landing lights I have ever seen. We both jumped out a bed and my husband ran out into the field which is behind our house. But within the 5-10 seconds it took us to get out of the house the object was gone. I was ready to chalk this whole thing up to a strange plane from the recent air-show until my husband pointed out the one thing that didn’t add up, we heard nothing the entire time, just the crickets.;41.0395;-81.3615
