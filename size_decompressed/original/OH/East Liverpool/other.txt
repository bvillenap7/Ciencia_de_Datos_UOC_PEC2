I was taking my dog out and I looked up at sky. It was mostly cloudy except for a break in clouds.  I noticed two very bright lights in the sky. . bigger than stars which were moving in tandem.  They seemed to be climbing straight up and then disappeared.  They were not aircraft because they were to close together and it was not the meteor shower.;40.6774;-80.6006
