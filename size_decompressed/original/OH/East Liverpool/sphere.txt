I have never known of a site to tell my sighting to and just heard of your site tonite.  It happened at my home in my yard in the summer of 1973.  The ufo was rotating and spinning and swooped down, spinning before our eyes, and then went sailing up, paused, then took off.  It was red, blue, green, yellow, and pink.  It was shaped like a see thru box.  Like a 3-D one you would draw on a paper as an optical illusion.;40.6774;-80.6006
