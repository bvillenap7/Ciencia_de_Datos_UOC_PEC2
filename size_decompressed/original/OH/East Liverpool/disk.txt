it was on mother's day of 1999, on my way home from my mother's house.  i was on route 11, the exit before beaver creek state park.  on;1999-05-09 23:00:00;minute;it was on mother's day of 1999, on my way home from my mother's house.  i was on route 11, the exit before beaver creek state park.  on my left hand side, right above the trees my 13 year old son and i seen the ufo up very close hovering above the trees.  i said to my son, do you see what i see?  yes, he said.  there it was,a great big, huge craft.  there were several bright blue lights.  on each side there was very bright white strobe lights that kept flashing very, very fast.  up above the lights were windows that looked like they would go all the way around.  i seen the craft as close as it would be to the top of the trees.  it could not have  been more than 20 feet away.  i know if i had a camera, it would probably be the closet picture of any ufo photographed.  i said to my son as i turned off to the beaver creek exit, do you want me to pull over or go left to see it again?  he said , no mom, just head home.  i am a college educated female and i swear, i will never doubt a ufo sighting again.  i do not know if i will ever see a ufo up close again.  i can only hope, and when, or if i do to snap a picture or video of a ufo, so very close.  my son and i stayed shook up over the incident for several days.  we told friends and family, but this is the first time to report the ufo.  someday i want to be hypnotized, to see,what i may not remember even if it is the tiniest detail.
