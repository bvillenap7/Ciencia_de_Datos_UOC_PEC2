In 'Classic House' Formation, described as 1 light leading, and 2-by-2 square following:  The formation moved silently and at a constant pace across the sky.   Once the leader of the formation reached a specific point in the sky, it disappeared (no fading), then as each light reached the same location in the sky, they also disappeared.  When there were two lights left, the back right UFO fired a shot (smaller light) that traveled to the back left UFO.  Then they both disappeared.;41.4523;-81.1484
