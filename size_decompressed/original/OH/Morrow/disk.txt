Way in the distance there appeared what seemed to be a star in the horizon.  staring at the star I noticed it to appear closer and closer.  as it hovered above the pond I had seen that it was a disk shape almost like the classical shape of flying saucers seen on old black and white movies.  the top was a bright light and the bottom was black like a shadow.  I knew this could be no plane nor helicopter because there was complete silence and a airplane just cant stop and hover like that making no noise at all as close as i was (apx.40yards).  after ten minutes or so the ufo shot straight up faster it would seem then the fasted jet or missle in the world.  upon my conclusion of what i saw, i FIRMLY believe that this was a true U.F.O.  i've never seen nothing like that ever in my lifetime and reflecting on this I still get the willys when I think about it or when I tell my story to my wonderful daughter.
