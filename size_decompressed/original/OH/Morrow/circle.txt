Orangish/red sphere seen by two witnesses in southwestern ohio;2013-08-10 23:40:00;2-3 minutes;orangish/red sphere seen by two witnesses in southwestern ohio My girlfriend and I had just got home and we saw an orange red circular object flying from south to north.  It appeared to be flying to high to be a balloon but too low to be a jet.  The UFO had no blinking lights and was traveling fast over the night sky and made no sound.  After about 20 to 30 seconds a second orange red circular object was flying in the same direction a little bit slower than the first one.   After about 2 minutes the first UFO slowly dimmed while still traveling north at an accelerated rate.  The second UFO was still traveling slower than the first but still faster than I have seen jets travel.   The second UFO did the same thing the first did slowly dimmed its lights, but this one was closer than the first so you could still see it travel a little ways after it had dimmed its lights.;39.348;-84.1163
