Three orange lights/equilateral triangle over SW Ohio about 45 seconds then disappeared.;2013-09-27 22:22:00;45 seconds;Three orange lights/equilateral triangle over SW Ohio about 45 seconds then disappeared. My friends and I were hanging out around the fire by the river, when we looked up and saw 3 orange lights just above the treeline. These lights formed a perfect equilateral triangle.  The lights were moving in unison, very slowly across the sky until disappearing after about 45 seconds. All my friends tried to record the lights on their phones but it didn't show up. One of my friends called his dad and asked if he had seen the lights.  His dad went outside and said no but he had just seen some fighter/military jets.  This was about 5 minutes after we had seen the triangular form. About an hour after all of this, me and one of my friends were inside playing cards, when his brother came in and said there was a big explosion.  I looked on facebook and there were several statuses about seeing a meteor.  Today I looked at the news and there were over 100 sightings of the meteor that happened about an hour after our ufo sighting.;39.348;-84.1163
