UFO with strobing lights closing fast distance and moving with me;2020-05-03 22:00:00;4-5 hours;UFO with strobing lights closing fast distance and moving with me To whom it may concern,  On Sunday, May 3rd, 2020 in Vermilion, OH, at approximately 10 PM, I witnessed an unidentified flying object for nearly nearly four to five hours.  I first noticed it when I seen a bright glowing object in the sky with orange flares coming off either sides.  As I would start walking closer towards it, it would come in closer dimming its light. I knocked on my neighbors door to get a witness, but my knock went unanswered. As I was in the vestibule to the neighbor and out of sight of the UFO, it went higher into the sky.  When I returned to the sidewalk, the UFO would come back in on me.  It followed my every movement.  It was instantaneous movement.  If I moved left, it immediately went left on queue with my movement.  Same with all movements.  When it went to the highest peak above the lake, it would blink orange looking like an inordinate star. Only when it faced directly north.  When it was more on the northwestern side, it strobe between blue, yellow, and orange.  I finally got my neighbor outside during this time and she also witnessed that when someone was around me that it would go into the distance.  I had her stay close to the building in the vestibule, so I could prove to her that it would come back if I were alone. The amount of time that it took to come back so close from the distance it was at discounts a drone theory.  When it came in, it would hove r at least 200-300 yards in the sky just above the development across the street. Earlier that day, my fiancée and I had done chalking on the sidewalk in huge letters that says, “STAY SAFE OHIO, WE’RE IN THIS TOGETHER.”  I finally finished around 8:30-9:00pm on the chalking. Within the hour is when I noticed what I’m explaining. I do have video.  Other people in the neighborhood have also seen this within the last couple of weeks. A neighbor across the street a couple of weeks ago was so scared that she took her dog back inside immediately when they just started their walk because the dog got really freaked out.  It was at the point that I went to get that neighbor to witness this as well that the UFO left.  This was around 3:00am on Monday, May 4th, 2020.  Like I said, I did get 2 videos.  The shape is hard to describe.  When it got close, it looked like a metallic, circular bottom with a cylinder top.  When it was close, only one dim light that looked like a dim UV light would appear.  In the distance is when the lights would strobe again.  The main consistent color was orange.;41.4105;-82.3590000000002
