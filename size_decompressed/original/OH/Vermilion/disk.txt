I live in Vermilion, Ohio, in an apartment, about 50 feet from Lake Erie.  My bedroom faces the lake.   I woke up at 1:00 AM and looked out my window and saw a disc shaped craft traveling from west to east . As it was traveling east, it made a sharp turn to the north.  Two other craft were behind it , and followed the same path.  There was a slight cloud cover, but you  could see the  domes on top of the discs. The crafts had a light greenish hue to them.  Two years ago, my wife and I both saw a spacecraft come almost directly over our car.  It was the same disc shape, but had lights around the sides of the disc and 3 white lights underneath the craft. It was traveling from a northwest to a southeast direction,  I know you just wanted one occurance, but I felt  you should know this too.;41.4105;-82.3590000000002
