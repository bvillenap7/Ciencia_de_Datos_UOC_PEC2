Triangular formation over Middletown, Ohio;2011-12-03 18:58:00;approximately 5 minutes;triangular formation over Middletown, Ohio My husband was looking due North as he was driving out of our neighborhood and saw a light come over his head towards the Northern horizon.  He stopped his car to watch, thinking it was a meteor.  As it descended towards the horizon, it broke into three distinct lights. He had me on my cell phone at that point, and I came out on our deck to observe.  I saw the three lights.  From our vantage point, they seemed to be just West of AK Steel.   The lights hovered for several minutes in various triangular formations, sometimes flickering out and reappearing. After about 4 minutes, the lights were falling towards the horizon.  At some point, one light appeared to move to the east almost directly over AK Steel.   All lights gradually lowered and flickered out. I videotaped the event on my iPhone.  The quality is not great, but could possibly be enhanced by someone with good software.;39.5134780722891;-84.3970595180719
