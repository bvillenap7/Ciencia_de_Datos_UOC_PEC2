I then realized this was something I had never encountered before, all my life I have had paranormal experiences that I couldn't explain, but thius was the first sighting of a craft like this one. I lost sight of it above the cab of my truck as I passed it. I thought of pulling off the side of the road to take a closer look, but fear took over as the thought came to me that if Icould see them,then they could see me. as I drove toward town, going down hill now, I glanced at my rearview mirrow and saw it still sitting in the same place. If any of the cars going uphill noticed the craft, I saw no brakelights come on, if they had stopped then I would have too. or if someone else had been with me I might have pulled over, but being alone I wasn't taking any chances. I must say' that I never thought u.f.o,s really existed that couldn't be explained, but I now know that they exist. I can't say whether it was something our government has that they're not disclosing to us, but I must say that I would have not been able to have comprehended that something the size of this craft could just sit there wthout making a sound or! movemen t that I could detect. and let me add that this was a bright night, as I could see there was nothing under this craft holding it up, thats when I realized what I was seeing.Thank you for reading this, keep an open mind to the fact that many things exist in our universe that cannot be explained by rational minds, I feel that I have been blessed by getting a peek.;39.5134780722891;-84.3970595180719
4 Lights over Middletown;2012-09-29 21:15:00;3 minutes;4 Lights over Middletown First, one single ball of light was falling in the sky. We thought it was a meteor until it broke into 4 separate pieces that continued to fall and had very long tails of light.  The four lights and their tails then disappeared after falling for about ten seconds.  We thought they were gone until they reappeared about ten seconds later in a perfect diagonal line in the shape of simple orbs. They continued to move from a diagonal to a straight line and back and forth for about 2-3 minutes until they had fallen so low we could no longer see them.  The light from each one was not consistent either, they would be lit for about five seconds, would flicker out and then would reappear.;39.5134780722891;-84.3970595180719
3 bright circular stationery objects over Middletown Ohio;2019-06-18 19:00:00;15 minutes;3 bright circular stationery objects over Middletown Ohio Three circular bright (lighted, or reflecting light) objects seeing over Middletown Ohio. One was high in the northeastern sky, one was high in the north western sky, the third halfway down to horizon in the northwestern sky.  They were stationary, not blinking, remained visible for 15 Minutes until obscured by clouds.  The color is what one would expect it to be if light was being reflected by a Chrome object.   Witnessed by two adults (former business owners), one mid 60s (a pilot for 41 years), one mid 50s.;39.5134780722891;-84.3970595180719
