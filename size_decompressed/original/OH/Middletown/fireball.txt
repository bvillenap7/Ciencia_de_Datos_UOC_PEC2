I saw one tonight.....and watched closely as it faded and I could see marker lights of an aircraft. Wondering.....if the Air Force is using a new fuel that causes these Orange Balls?  Wright Patterson is near by.......but this is the first I have seen of an Orange Ball. It was defineatly an airplane.......why it flamed so orange I do not know..... Wondering if they are using a new fuel.....causing all these reports. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
