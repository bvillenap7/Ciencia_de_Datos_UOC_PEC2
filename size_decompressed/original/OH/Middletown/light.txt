A fading light in the night sky.....;2001-07-20 01:30:00;00:15;A fading light in the night sky..... Last summer, I would say mid July, me and a couple of buddies were out walking the neighborhood (past curfew).  We were discussing something not interesting to me, I turned my gaze to the night sky (which was rather clear that night, not a cloud in the sky), when I noticed a small light, looked like a star from a galaxy light years away.  I began to return my gaze to my friend when I noticed the light move a bit, very slowly.  I interrupted the conversation and told them to look at the object.  I asked Does anyone no what that is?, and my friend replied, Could it be a satellite?.  We were about to say something else when the object seemed to get brighter.  We stopped and kept our gaze on it for about 6 seconds.  All of the sudden (and I swear on my mothers grave) it seemed to dim a little bit every second, until it disappeared.  Now I have been studying astronomy as a hobby for about a year and a half now, and I often research or ask people (teachers, chatters, etc...) if they know of what I saw.  So far I have no answers.  If anyone (hopefully one of you out there) has any answers or more clues for me, please e-mail me at ((e-address deleted))  (I know the name is sort of funny but plese bare with it) Thanks for reading and I hope you guys find the answers you are looking for. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witnesses may have observed the flare from an Iridium satellite, after which the satellite flew into the Earth's shadow.  Witness does not indicate what direction he was looking, so we can only guess.  PD));39.5134780722891;-84.3970595180719
four bright lights northwest of Middletown Ohio.;2007-07-21 22:10:00;30 sec.;four bright lights northwest of Middletown Ohio. after cooking out in the woods we where getting ready to go back to the house. I was standing beside my son while he was gitting in the go-kart i saw what looked like bright stars in the skies. Two of them where close together and moved to the left and then down below the treeline. They moved togeather at the same rate. When they went below the treeline I saw two more above them through the trees, They did not move togeather but the bottom light went out after about 5 sec. The forth light floated down untill it went below the treeline.													I did not see a parachute or a smoke trail behind these lights, and they where not the lights of airplanes. The intire incedent lasted about 30 sec. or less.;39.5134780722891;-84.3970595180719

The lights was sorta round in shape and would blink.  The four lights would appear to have been chasing one another, then all of a sudden they where gone.;39.5134780722891;-84.3970595180719
