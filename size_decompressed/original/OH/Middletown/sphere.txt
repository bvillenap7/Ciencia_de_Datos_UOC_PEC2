Red ball of light turns white then red and floats away into the sky,very close to it,only about 25 ' up;1980-04-18 23:59:00;3-4 min.;Red ball of light turns white then red and floats away into the sky,very close to it,only about 25 ' up When i was seven years old me and my mother saw a glowing red ball of light at about 12am ,we walked out onto the back patio to watch it float over the small town of middletown,oh. float over the paper factory thats across the river from the house, in a very fluid like motion till it crossed the smoke stacks and stop directly over the Ohio river, at that point it did not move and made no noise, it was about 1/4 mile or less away and looked to be about the size of a VW bug.As it was motionless about 25 feet off the ground and at a distance of about 1/4 mile or less the red glow turned to a bright white light but seemed not to project the light onto the ground.This was only for about 5 sec. and it turned back to the dark red glow and seemed to follow the path that it had come back over the factory but at a steady rise,by the time it made it over the town (about 2 min.) it was very slow, it rose into the sky where we watched it untill it was only a dot in the sky.This was before there was camcorders or atleast we didnt have one it was 1980.About one year later my grandmother witnessed the same thing in her field behind her house in trenton ohio.same red light that turned white and then back to red and rose to the sky.about 1995 there was a scam where someone tied flares to a ballon and let it go,and i saw that along with the whole town, you could see the fire falling off of it, what i saw in 1980 was real and i will never forget it,i have always watched the skys ever since but have yet to see anything.;39.5134780722891;-84.3970595180719
Reshaping spherical object - high altitude and traveling due north (iPhone video);2014-07-01 19:39:00;15 minutes;Reshaping spherical object - high altitude and traveling due north (iPhone video) I captured this object and hurried to used my iPhone and zoomed as best I could. I estimate it was at least 1000 feet up and moving in a perfectly straight line, due North.  I thought it might be a bird until I saw it was a spherical shape that was collapsing then reshaping to a sphere again, over and over.  Solid black. I also thought it might have been a tumbling trash can lid, but it kept constant altitude and a perfectly straight path.  I watched it all the way to at least Trenton until I could see it no more.  I have a link to the video in a DropBox folder.  The video is unedited and straight from my iPhone 5c.;39.5134780722891;-84.3970595180719
