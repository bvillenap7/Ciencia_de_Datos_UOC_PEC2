April 16th 2019.  About 8 PM before sunset.  My Girlfriend and I saw an object traveling west off to the left of the sun, at about the Ten O'clock position. It was bright yellow ball with two streams of white smoke coming off the sides like wings. Flying in a straight line. This lasted about 5 mins. until it went over the tree tops past the horizon. It looked like it was either was going to hit the earth or flying the curvature of the earth. I thought it was an Asteroid.  I have never seen anything like it.;39.5134780722891;-84.3970595180719
