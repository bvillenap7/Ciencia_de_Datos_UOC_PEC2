UFO Sighting in Middletown Ohio. Real.;2010-07-26 00:19:00;1 HR 1/2;UFO Sighting in Middletown Ohio. Real. I was browsing YouTube and then the internet stopped.  I tried to connect for several more minutes before looking outside.  I saw a rather Odd Shaped Aircraft and took a picture of it on my phone.   Here is a link to the picture:  http://i29.tinypic.com/2zgrvc3.jpg  I swear it isn't fake.  I looked across the street and saw around 2 other people.  I saw them pointing at something in the sky.  Then I noticed it was the same thing that I saw. Thanks for your time.  ~Owner of ((name of company deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.5134780722891;-84.3970595180719
