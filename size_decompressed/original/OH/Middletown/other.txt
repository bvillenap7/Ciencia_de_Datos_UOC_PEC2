As I sat out in my backyard to take a break on a cloudy afternoon I saw what looked like a giant black bug shaped object that appeared to hop across the sky and immediatly followed by what looked like a twirling black sickle looking object.  They seemed to just vanish and looked like they were putting on some sort of a demonstration.  Anyway I went back into the house and thought who would believe me even if I did report it.  Then I saw some of the photos taken by the Mars rovers and cameras and found what looked like a similar object in the background of sol 605 photo and other photos.
