A fast moving ball of light in the night sky;2019-03-23 21:00:00;2 minutes;A fast moving ball of light in the night sky Hanging out with my small group of friends at the waverly skatepark we were getting ready to pack up as it was dark and we were tired but we decided to just sit around for awhile.  Some time had passed and we were looking at the stars and one friends had asked us if any of us knew why a certain star was so bright.  I told him it was probably the north star but after looking at what he saw it was in the middle of the Big dipper constellation and had started moving after we started looking at it.  The Object was a bright white light.  It was a clear night sky with no clouds so all the stars around us were visible.  When the “star” or object had started moving it was incredibly fast and moved in a strange zig zag pattern which is abnormal for any kind of plane.  After we watched it start moving for about 1 minute, the light it was emitting started to fade and in roughly 5 seconds completely went dark. After another ten seconds it appear again but was a slightly darker color and was yellow this time and also faded out of view.  After the second time of it fading we never saw it again;39.0434;-83.1243
