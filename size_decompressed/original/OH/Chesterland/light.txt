I was driving South on Chillicothe Road at about 11:45 pm. I saw a bright, concentrated ball of light appear in the southern sky directly in front of me. It was shooting downward at an angle. I thought, WOW, A METEOR!  But instead of burning up and vanishing, as I've seen meteors do, it turned sharply (without slowing down at all) and shot back up, disappearing into the clouds. It looked like a tiny moon. If there were a time lapse image of the path of the light, it would look like a huge check mark in the sky.;41.5363000000001;-81.3401000000001
