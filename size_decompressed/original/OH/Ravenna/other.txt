Shooting Object Across Ravenna Sky;2006-10-03 21:43:00;30 seconds;Shooting Object Across Ravenna Sky My daughter and I were walking in Ravenna and at 9:43pm, tonight October 3, a large, bright object went across the sky coming in from the SE and disappearing in the NNW.  It appeared to be burning up or something, headed down at an angle cutting across the sky.  Similar to a shooting star but much larger and far closer.  Definitely NOT an airplane!  The shape was square-like, but it appeared to be flaming (whitish, some pale orange light) so it masked some of the definition.  As it reached the NNW, it seemed to just suddenly disappear.;41.1682;-81.2398000000001
