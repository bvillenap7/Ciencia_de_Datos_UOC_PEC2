I was travelling west on Ohio Turnpike I-80 aprox.11:00pm to 11:20pm driving a cube van to Cleveland,Ohio from Pittsburgh Penn. The sky was clear and then from no where this glowing giant green sphere appeared directly ahead of us and high in the sky and decended faster than anything i have ever seen in flight.it zoomed down vertically in such a perfect straight line and then just dissapeared before the horizon of the tree line it was approx.1 to 2 miles ahead of us .I say us because a co-worker was in a truck ahead of me approx.100 yards in front of me driving an identical truck and saw the event also there was no trail from it of any sort, was larger than a commercial jetliner and traveled so fast....faster than something falling. I am a concert lighting designer and am very educated in lighting and different light sources and color filtration and have never seen or heard of a unit that would put out that much light and have such a vivid color green. i have also worked with lasers....this object was way too big to have came from a laser source.;41.1682;-81.2398000000001
Two glowing orange fiery orbs sighted by Ravenna , Ohio family;2012-11-17 19:17:00;1 minute;Two glowing orange fiery orbs sighted by Ravenna , Ohio family I am a former Marine and have seen many things in the sky, but this past Saturday night at around 7:15,  what I witnessed with my family can not be explained. I went out on the porch to smoke, and two glowing orbs caught my immediate attention. They were coming over the tree-line from the south-east, and heading northwest. They were traveling too slow to be a plane, too fast to be a blimp , and there was virtually no noise to them.  On the little bit of video I captured ( I ran into the house for my phone when I realized I might be seeing a UFO ), you can hear a regular plane flying over our heads about a mile away. These orbs came over the treeline, maybe 300 feet over our heads and travelled close in proximity and in unisone. As the orbs flew off, they were joined by two more, and seemed to line up on top of each other, forming a triangle. They then continued in their westerly direction until I could no longer view them.;41.1682;-81.2398000000001
Orange sphere hovering looked almost like fire;2013-08-13 22:20:00;30 seconds;Orange sphere hovering looked almost like fire While driving home from work, driving south on state route 14 and entering the Ravenna township area I witnessed what apeared to be a sphearacle object hovering about two hundred feet or so in the air off to my left.  It immediately drew my attention and I slowed to look closer.   I have never in my 33 years seen anything this odd looking.  It didn't apear to be moving but hovering.  As I slowed, i noticed traffic coming behind me, so I moved on. I was swerving all over as I tried to view it in my rear view mirror, the object apeared to move west across 14.   I've never seen anything like it and quite honestly it freaked me out which is why I feel obliged to report this event.;41.1682;-81.2398000000001

It t;2018-06-02 23:00:00;1 minute;My fiance and I looked out over the trees Northwest from our house and saw a bright whitish gold light floating up over the trees.  It traveled at a consistent speed not too slow not too fast and did not change directions.  We watched it move from Northwest to Southeast and it got dimmer and suddenly disappeared, not behind anything but literally vanished before our eyes.  It was lower than a plane and did not look like a weather balloon or a floating lattern.  Resembled a star that was moving (not a shooting star).;41.1682;-81.2398000000001
