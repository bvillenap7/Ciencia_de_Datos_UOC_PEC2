It was very fast, and dissapeared before the  horizon ... It did not fade out  when it dissapeared, it just vanished... Had to be a good 10 miles away from my vehicle I was traveling in ( IMO )  It was much too fast to be an airplane, and I have seen shooting stars before,, and they  fade through the sky,,,, this DID NOT it just vanished!  My buddy in a vehicle behind me  experienced the same thing;41.1682;-81.2398000000001
