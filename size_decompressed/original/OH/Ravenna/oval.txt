I just wanted to report this to someone and happen to find this site a few minutes ago.  My sighting happend about two hours ago.  I am in Ravenna, Ohio, and decided to do a little early spring catfishing since its very warm this evening.   As i was fishing at my local reservoir, I noticed the sky was very clear except for a few misty clouds.  About 8:30pm something caught my eye and I saw these two white lights moving in a cloud.  They were moving in circles but in oposite directions.  One counter clock ways and the other clock ways.  Some times one would make bigger loops and then back to a tight circle.  I watched them for 30 mins or so and then they were just gone.   I returned home and looked up what I had saw and way amazed how many people have reported the same thing so I wanted to report it.  It was strange not scary just strange.   Thank you for reading my report.;41.1682;-81.2398000000001
