Fiery orange triangular shaped object seen flying over the campgrounds here in Ravenna, Ohio.  My husband and I both witnessed this object while out camping.  It had absolutely no sound, no propellers, flew in a circular flight pattern from west to east, did not fade out like a meteorite, before disappearing into the clouds above us.  This is actually the second night I have seen this object.  It was flying above the campground the night before too.  This object was spotted on June 10th by me and by both of us (husband and I) on June 11th 2-13.;41.1682;-81.2398000000001
