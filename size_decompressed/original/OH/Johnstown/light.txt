Only lasted a few seconds.  No sound. Went to take the dog out one last time before bed.  We were walking North. I was admiring the stars, it was a clear night, even though a storm was supposed to be rolling in later.  All of a sudden I see this HUGE RED Pulsing orb in the sky.  There was no noise.  I don't know how else to explain it.  It appeared out of no where, then faded into nothing.  It only lasted a few seconds.  I just shrugged it off as some weird lightning.   I told my husband when we got back in and he just looked at me funny.  It was bugging me what I saw so did some Google searches, but came up with nothing.  That is until I Googled, UFO sightings in Ohio 2015, and came across the database, and noticed some similar stories.  So decided to report mine as well.  Thank you.
