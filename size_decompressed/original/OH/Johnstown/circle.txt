Bright round object with outer ring visible;2020-07-28 22:36:00;1 hour;Bright round object with outer ring visible Our family was outside watching for the Delta Aquarids and the Alpha Capricornids meteor shower.  We live outside of Johnstown, Ohio and it was a very clear night.  Our daughter was taking pictures of a bright object in the sky, which we thought was likely Saturn because of the outer ring in the picture.  This picture was taken with a Samsung Galaxy S8+.  This was the brightest and largest object (other than the moon) in the night sky, glowing a bright orange/yellow â€“ different from the other stars.  After looking at pictures of Saturn, we determined that this object looked nothing like the pictures we were seeing.  It has appeared on a few more occasions since the night of the 28th.;40.1448;-82.6965
