Missle shaped craft, no wings, no lights, no landing gear, no sound, no CHEM TRAIL;2002-08-16 19:30:00;2-3 Minutes;Missle shaped craft, no wings, no lights, no landing gear, no sound, no CHEM TRAIL I am unsure of the exact date this occurred, but it was a Sunday late afternoon. My children and I were swimming at my mothers house. It was shortly after dinner time, but the sun was still above the trees. They live outside the city on and acre of land and recently had 5 very large trees removed from the backyard in order to put in the swimming pool. We are about 25 miles away from Akron/Canton Airport so we are used to seeing aircraft flying overhead. Those traffic lanes are generally East-West and NorthEast-West.  We also have several small airports nearby where little two-seaters and bi-planes take off and land. What made us stop and stare at this particular craft was that it was flying at about 2-3000 feet and going from North to South. The craft was shaped like a missle almost, but there were no wings, no lights, no landing gear, no sound, no CHEM TRAIL. The sun (which was in the west) appeared to be reflecting off the exterior of the craft, yet as it traveled south, the glare never stopped. If you have ever watched an aircraft pass overhead, there is always a point where the sun is no longer reflected off the aircraft and back in your eyes and you can get a better look. This was not the case. What I originally took to be sun glare (bright white) must have been lighting of some kind. My mother (58) and step-father (60) both saw it and we discussed it for almost an hour after it was gone. Two of my 4 children also remember seeing it, but have nothing new or remarkable to add.
