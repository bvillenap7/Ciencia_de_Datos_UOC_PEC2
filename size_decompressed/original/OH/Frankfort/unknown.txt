Orange light while something was dropped Saw two white lights moving in the sky. The lights were blinking randamly and were bright like an aircraft but blinking randamly. When the light was not on there appeared to be a faint yellow or orange light. The lights moved much like aircraft except the movemebt was more errattic, ie, the lights abbruptly chanced direction and speed. A bright orange light appeared at one of the light location and the blinking light stopped. The orange light was bright, had a bright center and a fringe of distinct rays that ended in a circle around the bright center. Something was dropped while the orange light was on. Whatever was dropped could be seen dropping much like you can barely see a fire works rocket going up prior to it exploding except it was dropping. The orange light then went out and the blinling began again. I believe the orange light was relatively statioary. Shortly thereafter the secund light did the same as the first light relative to the orange light and dropping something. The two lights then deaded off to the Ease and disappeared. As the lights moved off to the East I could hear a noise much like a jet but less turbilent. Unlike a jet plane the noise did not diminish as the lights moved off into the distance. The sound abruptly stopped.;39.3903;-83.1986
