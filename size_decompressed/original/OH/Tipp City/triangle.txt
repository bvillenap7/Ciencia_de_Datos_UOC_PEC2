Triangle object  with no lights;2009-02-24 21:00:00;10 seconds;Triangle object  with no lights Was sitting in hot tub looking North at North Star and surrounding stars.  When I was facing North, I saw a triangular shaped object.  Was matching color of the nights sky (almost could not see) traveling south from the north.  If I had not been looking at the area I probably would not have noticed.   I am used to looking at night sky and watching air traffic in the area (as there is an airport within five miles)and Wright Patt AFB is about 10 miles away.  I could see the outline of the object as it glided with no engine sound or any lights.  I estimate it was at about 1000 feet.   I watched as it went South past my position and I could see it triangular shape and four circular lights on rear of vehicle as it traveled Southward.  The lights were very soft colored orange.  As I tried to comprehend the craft it disappeared into the night sky.  Since it was dark colored it just disapeared into night sky like a brown stone dropped into mudddy water.   Within 10 seconds a commercial plane began to decend into landing approach.  Was totally diffrent.  Had blinking lights, I could see the airplane, I could hear the engines.  The triangle glided down from higher altitude, had no sound, and was almost invisible (shadowlike) and moved smooth and fast across sky.  It looked thick and angular unlike Stealth Bomber, ect.   Was very strange.  If I was not looking directly at where it appeared I would have never even noticed it.  I keep telling myself it was military since AFB so close.  But it flew through commercial airspace with no lights and flew with a smoothness I have never seen before.
