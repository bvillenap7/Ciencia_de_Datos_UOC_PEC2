Bright blue object moving randomly throughout the sky on the night of August 12;2012-08-12 23:20:00;30 mintues;Bright blue object moving randomly throughout the sky on the night of August 12 UFO spotting on 08/12/12.  I drove into the country to find a good spot to watch the meteor shower around 22:30.  I found a dark place to watch and called a friend to come out.  Around 23:30, we spotted a unusually bright blue light in the sky almost right above where we were watching the shower.  To our amazement, it started to move.  It would start slow, then rapidly speed up and fly extremely fast.  It left behind a faint blue trail.  The UFO would suddenly stop moving.  It would remain stationary for up to a minute.  It would sometimes move in linear paths, but other times it would make figure eights or S-shaped movements.  It would sometimes fade out of view but then return.  These random movement patterns continued for a half-hour until we had to leave.  The UFO was circular shaped and bright blue in color.  It was the brightest object in the sky.  It was approximately about the size of the North Star, possibly a bit larger.;41.2778999999999;-84.3578000000002
