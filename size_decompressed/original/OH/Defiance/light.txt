White light shining down like a spot light then zipping back and forth and upward.;1994-07-10 02:00:00;5 to 10 seconds;White light shining down like a spot light then zipping back and forth and upward. I do not remember the exact date, but it was sometime between late June and July 24th of 1994.  I was walking down the middle of the street with a friend at around 2:00 am.  Suddenly a light shined done on us from behind.  It was like a spotlight shining from a helicopter, only there was no noise that is associated with a helicopter.  We both turned around at the same time and saw a light hovering just above the tree line roughly 300 yards away from us.  When we turned the light seemed to instantly reduce in intensity, like it wasnâ€™t a spotlight anymore, but just a light.  The object then zipped the left and upward, right and up, left and up and then back to the right and upward at a 45 degree angle and disappeared.

My husband and I were coming home after visiting some friends, shortly after midnight. When we got e on the highway I looked out the window and saw what appeared to be the space station. My first thoght  was the coloring was wrong, the station is a bright white light,this was orangish in color. It also appeared to be a bit larger. Then I realized that despite all that,it was too late to be the station. The station always sets around ten o'clock, it was now after tweleve. About five minutes later we pulled in front of our home. Once the car stopped I pointed it out to my husband and then I noticed it was moving. Slowly,smoothly and silently it moved eastward through the night sky. We watched it from our car until it was ot of sight.;41.2778999999999;-84.3578000000002
Five white lights that merged into one;2019-10-08 07:00:00;10 minutes;Five white lights that merged into one I was driving North on State Route 637 and I saw 5 small white points of light in the North.  There were 4 white lights shaped like the points of a box with one white light above the top.  As I got closer to the lights, suddenly all 5 whites became one light.  It started moving East.  I turned on a side road to take a picture with my phone and the light was nowhere to be found.  The entire experience was visible for approximately 10 minutes.  All the lights were round in shape.;41.2778999999999;-84.3578000000002
