A LOW FLYING TRIANGLE SHAPED CRAFT WAS OBSERV FLYING VERY SLOW WITH MINIMAL NOISE CAUSING ALL THE POWER IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO GO OUT.;1989-07-15 01:30:00;10 MIN;A LOW FLYING TRIANGLE SHAPED CRAFT WAS OBSERV FLYING VERY SLOW WITH MINIMAL NOISE CAUSING ALL THE POWER IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO GO OUT. HELLO, I AM A CREDIBLE WITNESS OF A UFO SIGHTING. I'M A 12 YEAR VETERAN POLICE OFFICE. WITHOUT BEING TOO DESCRIPTIVE, I CURRENTYLY WORK FOR THE 4TH LARGETS CITY IN AMERICA. IN THE SUMMER OF 1989 OR 1990, NOT SURE THE EXACT YEAR.  IT OCCURRED A VERY LONG TIME AGO WHEN I WAS A YOUNG TEENAGER.  THE EVENT HAS BEEN BURNT INTO MY MEMORY.  I WILL PROVIDE THE INFORMATION VERY TO THE POINT, HOPING TO MAKE IT EASY FOR ANY READER. IN THE SUMMER OF 1989 OR 1990, MY FRIENDS AND I WERE HAVING A SLEEP OVER, USING MY FATHERS CAMPER WHICH WAS PARKED IN THE DRIVE WAY AT MY HOUSE.  IT WAS A CLEAR, WARM EARLY MORNING, APPROX 12:00AM TO 2:00AM.  THERE WERE ABOUT FOUR FRIENDS THAT OBSERVED THE UFO, TO INCLUDE MY MOTHER WHOM I RAN INSIDE TO HAVE HER TO COME OUT. THE LOCATION WAS IN DEFIANCE COUNTY OHIO, IN A SUB DIVISION NEIGHBORHOOD WITH APPROX 50 HOMES IN THE CIRCLE DRIVE NAMED LAKEVIEW DRIVE.  IT IS LOCATED NEAR THE PAULDING COUNTY LINE ON THE BANKS OF THE MAUMEE RIVER.  IT IS A RURAL SETTING ON ST. RT. 111. A LARGE DARK COLORED CRAFT, APPROX THE SIZE OF A LARGE COMMERCIAL JET AIRPLANE,  FLEW NORTH OVER LAKEWIEW DRIVE.  IT WAS VERY LOW TO THE GROUND AND WAS FLYING (MOVING) AT A VERY SLOW SPEED.  IT LOOKED LIKE A SPEED OF AROUND 40 MPH.  IN MY OPINION TOO SLOW TO BE ABLE TO HOLD FLIGHT.   IT NEVER STOPPED, AND DID NOT APPEAR TO CHANGE SPEED.  I COULD HEAR A SLIGHT SOUND, NOT AT ALL LOUD, BUT WAS A CONSTANT WIND/FAN LIKE SOUND.  I CAN REMEMBER THINKING TO MYSELF, IT'S SO CLOSE I COULD HIT THAT WITH MY BOW AND ARROW.  IT WAS IN A V- SHAPED FORMATION WITH THE FRONT COMING TO A SMOOTH ROUNDED POINT.  A SERIES OF LARGE ROUND, DIM WHITE LIGHTS, WERE ON THE BOTTOM, APPROX 3 TO 4 ON EACH SIDE FOLLOWING THE V FORMATION. THEY WERE NOT BLINKING.  AS THE CRAFT WAS DIRECTLY OVER TOP OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, ALL THE POWER WENT OUT. NOT A HOME OR STREET LIGHT WAS ON. IT WAS QUITE UNUSUAL AND CREEPY. AS THE CRAFT EXIT THE AREA IN THE DISTANCE, ALL THE POWER CAME BACK ON. THE POWER WAS OUT FOR ABOUT 30 ! SECONDS. APPROX 10 MIN LATER, THE SAME CARFT APPROACHED IN THE SAME LINE, FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. NOTHING HAD CHANGED. SAME SPEED, SOUNDS, AND LIGHTS. MY FRIENDS AND I WERE STILL PUMPED UP ABOUT THE FIRST SIGHTING SO WE USED OUR FLASHLIGHTS, POINTING  AND WAIVING THEM INTO THE AIR AT THE OBJECT.  WHEN THE CRAFT GOT OVERHEAD, ALL THE POWER IN THE BLOCK WENT OUT ONCE AGAIN. AND AS IT CONTINUED ON IN THE SAME DIRECTION, THE POWER CAME BACK ON. IF IT MATTERS AT ALL, THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAD BURRIED POWER LINES. I SOMETIMES SEE A UFO TV SHOW WHERE A CRAFT WAS SPOTTED IN THE ILL. / IN. AREA WHERE A V SHAPED CRAFT WAS SEEN IN ABOUT THE SAME TIME ERA. THE DRAWN PICTURES ARE QUITE SIMILAR, IF NOT THE SAME. MAYBE IT WAS A MILITARY PROJECT,OR  MAYBE NOT.  THIS IS JUST AN EXPERIENCE I DECIDED TO SHARE WITH ANYONE INTERESTED IN THE TOPIC. MAYBE IT CAN HELP WITH ANY LEADS IN PAST OR FUTURE UFO INVESTIGATIONS. CROP CIRCLES HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE PAULDING COUNTY AREA,  APPROX 5 TO 10 MILES FROM THIS SIGHTING. REAL OR NOT, I DON'T KNOW. I'M SURE THEY WERE INVESTIGATED.  THANK YOU.

Triangular craft silently moving through the air above me and past me.;2007-10-25 02:50:00;30 seconds;Triangular craft silently moving through the air above me and past me. I was driving home after driving over to the north side of town to pick something up.  I was less than half a mile from my house, coming up towards my turn off when I saw something in the sky that looked like a low airplane coming in on final approach at an airport, that's how low it was. It had to be no more than a few hundred feet in the air.  I turned off at my usual turn, and I could see this thing was low so I pulled over at a clearing where there weren't any trees around, parked, and got out. This thing, from what I could tell from the lights, was shaped like a triangle. There were two lights on the bottom of it at the front, one at the back at the point of the triangle, and then a blinking red light about 3/4 of the way back on it.  I was looking up thinking it was an airplane or a helicopter (when I was pulling over and getting out), but there was something wrong. This thing slowly passed literally right over me, but there was not a single sound coming from it. It was almost like it was just slowly seamlessly gliding through the air. From as low as this thing was, there should have been the sounds of an engine or something if it was a helicopter or a plane. And it sure wasn't coming in for a landing because the nearest airport was about 5 miles SW of where I was and this thing was traveling N-NE.  I watched it until I had just gotten past me and then I jumped back into my car and turned around because I wanted another look at this thing. I got back onto the road I had just turned off of, but this thing was nowhere to be found. I looked all over in the sky in the direction it was going in as well as all around in every direction and there was nothing. No white lights, no red blinking light, nothing. Just the moon and stars.  I drove for a little bit longer trying to find it again but couldn't find a single sign of it. After I couldn't find it again, I gave up and came back home.;41.2778999999999;-84.3578000000002
I saw a triangle red green and blue ((deleted word)).;2013-07-19 02:45:00;5 seconds;I saw a triangle red green and blue shit. I was laying down outside.  My friend was above me.  He was reaching for my card.  Then I thought I saw a shooting star.  I yelled shooting star.  Then I saw green lights followed by three red lights in a triangle formation.  Then it zoomed off with blue streaks at the end.  I ran to look to see if I could find it again.  I could hardly walk.
