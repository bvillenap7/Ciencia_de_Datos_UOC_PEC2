Bright orange circular object in Waterville, Ohio sky;2010-07-10 23:00:00;7 minutes;Bright orange circular object in Waterville, Ohio, sky On July 10, 2010 in Waterville, Ohio at approximately 11:00pm - 11:10 pm, my sister and I witnessed what looked like a large bright, orange, circular object moving slowly through the sky.  It was moving Southwest ( from the left to the right) at a slow but steady speed.  The bright light seemed to steadily fade or diminish to a small star-like  object as it moved further away. From the time that we noticed the object, the bright orange light lasted approximately two to three minutes until it faded into the  bright star-like object. We continued to watch the  object for approximately another four minutes until it disappeared out of sight.;41.4977999999997;-83.7266999999995
