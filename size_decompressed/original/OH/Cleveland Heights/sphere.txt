Glowing orb changes color and heads straight into Lake Erie.;1995-01-10 21:00:00;20 seconds;Glowing orb changes color and heads straight into Lake Erie. While out for a late evening walk in the cold January air a glowing object caught my eye. I was heading straight north at the time of the sighting and was only 5-6 miles from Lake Erie as the crow flies. At first, I was amazed to see as large a meteor as this one first appeared. The object came from the west and was moving at a very high rate of speed just a one would expect a meteor to do. It approached at appx.a 40' angle to the ground and was a bright yellowish green color, similar to a tennis ball. I quickly noticed, however, that this was no meteor. As it neared the ground it came to a complete stop and began pulsing and it's color changed from yellow to orange. It hung in mid air for 3-4 seconds and then headed straight down so fast that my eyes could barely keep up with it, possibly heading into Lake Erie. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We wonder whether the witness may be describing the dramatic event over Ontario, Canada Lake Erie and western Pennsylvania on Friday, August 25, 1995.  We will check with the witness.
