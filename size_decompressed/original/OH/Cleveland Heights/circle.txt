Saw a round orange-like orb moving from South to north difficult to estimate altitude.  An airliner was moving in the opposite direction but moving around at the same speed and passed this object.  Speed was steady , object was a very bright orange orb. Observer is an airline pilot!!!;41.5052999999994;-81.5566000000002
5 (five) bright orange-redish dime size Orbs flying in the eastern sky in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.;2013-06-28 22:10:00;10:30;5 (five) bright orange-redish dime size Orbs flying in the eastern sky in Cleveland Heights, Ohio At around 10:10 PM on Friday, June 28, 2013, I witnessed at least 5 (five) bright orange-redish dime size Orbs flying in the eastern sky towards/past the Fairmount neighborhood in Cleveland Heights, Ohio hovering at times and also moving around the sky coming towards me at times.  The Orbs seemed to get brighter and brighter.  The Orbs would just come and go at different times - appearing out of no where. Finally all 5 (five) appeared at once again. 3 (three) of the orbs formed a giant triangle shape formation while moving in the sky. The distance between each of these 3 (three) Orbs that made up the triangle shape formation was at least two hands held up in the sky apart from each other point in the formation of the triangle.  This lasted for at least 20 minutes or so all while making no sound. Then around 10:30 PM all the Orbs eventually disappeared behind some thin white clouds in the eastern sky...  My brother and at least 4 (four) neighbors who were pulling into their driveway all witnessed the same thing.  When the neighbors were getting out of their car â€“ they asked me and my brother if we were looking at the UFOs and stated that they had been watching them too for a while in the car driving.  CRAZY!!!  I've never seen anything like this...;41.5052999999994;-81.5566000000002
