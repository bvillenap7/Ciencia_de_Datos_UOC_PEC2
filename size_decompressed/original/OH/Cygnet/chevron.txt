Unknown aircraft flying over Cygnet Ohio;2006-03-04 19:47:00;Seconds;Unknown aircraft flying over Cygnet Ohio My husband and I were standing out in my parents yard, and we were looking toward the south skies, when we saw something flying just above tree top level. At first it looked like white birds flying overhead, and when it flew over our heads we saw that the craft looked like a boomerang shaped ojbect. It made absolutely no noise what so ever when it flew overhead. The lights on the craft were a very dim white lights and there appeared to be 4 lights. The craft was moving at a very high rate of speed, and all we could see was the dim lights. A shape of the craft could not be made out even though there is a little moon light over the area. The craft had to be of a dark color because it blended into the night sky (other than the lights) The craft moved from the south to a north easterly direction and then vanished. One of the eyewitnesses has worked on military and civilian aircraft and thinks what we saw tonight was not of current technology that exists.;41.2422;-83.648
