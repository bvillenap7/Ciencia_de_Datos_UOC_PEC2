(Military time) on March 26, 2016, in New Lexington, Ohio, 43764.   I was taking out the garbage, when I saw it flying, really practically floating because it was going so slowly over my house and over the building across from my house, flying in the direction of Northwest.  It was saucer-shaped, completely silent, blackish in color with 4 white lights blinking off and on pretty quickly, approximately 50 feet in diameter, flying lower than planes and helicopters generally fly.  I know it flew over Main Street toward the Courthouse here in New Lexington, Ohio.  The ship was dark in color, maybe black.  I was not able to get a picture because I did not have my cellphone with me.  The sighting only lasted about 2 minutes.;39.7194;-82.1975
