Strange rotating bright light appears, disappears, and re-appears;2010-01-28 04:45:00;20 minutes;Strange rotating bright light appears, disappears, and re-appears My fiance saw a strange light out of our living room window and told me to come and look because it was extremely bright.  I looked and saw this really bright light.  My camera is dead, so we looked at it through the scope of his rifle.  It was crescent shaped and appeared to be moving, as the light was brighter at times.  I could see it above the trees and power lines in the field beside our house.  Then suddenly it disappeared, only to reappear a few minutes later only dim, which we assumed meant it was farther away from us.  I got the feeling though, when i was looking through the scope, that it was looking at me. The bright light seemed to focus on me for a few minutes. It is back again : 4:50 on the opposite side of the tree.  And is gone again:4:55;39.153;-81.7915
