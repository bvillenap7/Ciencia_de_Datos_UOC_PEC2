Orange triangles in arrow formation;2014-08-30 20:00:00;7 minutes;Orange triangles in arrow formation In Kroger parking lot in Monroe, my fiance and I witnessed a formation of orange, glowing, triangle-shaped crafts hovering in sky over Middletown in distance.  Triangles first hovered in arrow shape and glowed.  Some went dark, others glowed brighter, then the others appeared again.   While they glowed in and out, they moved into different formations, including an arc shape.  Then some went dark.  The others went dark and they totally disappeared.;39.4373999999999;-84.3609999999999
