As I looked out my window (drivers side) I saw approximately five lights in the sky.  They seemed to be moving very slowly to the south.  From our perspective they seemed to be over LCI.  We pulled over on the side of the road and rolled the window down.  The various lights would fade out and then fade back in.  The whole thing was very similar to the “Phoenix Lights”, except the lights were not in a straight line.  The light on the bottom of the group seemed to have sparks or something being ejected from the rear (side opposite the direction of travel), although it was not dramatically so and didn’t seem to show on any of the others.  All of the lights eventually faded out and the event was over.  The entire thing lasted about a minute, but I don’t know how long the lights were visible before we saw them.  The car in front of us has pulled over earlier, but I didn’t know why.  He must have seen them before me.  A lot of cars leaving the Cincinnati Outlet Mall should have been in a great position to see the event as well.;39.4373999999999;-84.3609999999999
Two Brilliant blue lights darting around with rapid speed.;2011-12-22 18:57:00;13 minutes;Two Brilliant blue lights darting around with rapid speed. I observed two lights - a brilliant, sharp blue color comparable to blue christmas lights in the sky to the immediate Southwest of my position during the observation. Observation conditions as follows:  The local weather conditions: overcast with infrequent, occasional cloud breaks. Temperature: approximately mid forties degrees F.. Wind speed about 5mph - omnidirectional (changing directions occasionally from NW towards due W with occasional breeze from a Southwesterly direction)- perhaps MVR visibility (NOAA reference). EVENT SUMMARY: Event occurred from 18:57 hours to about 19:12 hours EST. I observed a brilliant, sharp blue light - ironically the exact color as an illuminated blue Christmas tree bulb / house bulb - drop rapidly from the sky and execute manuevers at low altitude that I can only describe as being like the irradic flight of an insect (a housefly perhaps). The object dipped in and out of the cloud deck several times - on several occassions perhaps even coming down to ground level -as it disappeared during those moments behind the distant tree line. The object was joined by a second identical object - and both objects dipped up and down in flight - occasionally going above the cloud deck to dip back down to extreme low altitude. The objects later returned to above the cloud deck - only occassionally to peak to a visible position just below the deck as they appeared to move more towards the southwest - and away from my range of vision. The objects were not fireworks - nor were they any form of conventional remotely controlled vehicle that I am aware of, as their speed of manueverability was outstanding, and unbelievable, almost surreal. The objects were distant - about approximately between 1/5th and 1/3rd miles away from my position on South Main Street. They were to the South West of my position. The objects appeared only to be brilliant, sharp lights - as I could not see a superstructure or siluetted outlined around them - I assume as a function of distance. The objects were strictly vibrant / electric blue, and no other color - with the exception that they appeared to become of a lighter tone from time to time, particularly as they positioned themselves at low altitudes. I would suggest that you please cross reference this sighting with other sightings from this general area - on this date - for validation, and that you should also make inquiries to local police departments and local airports concerning any possible phoned reports that may have been recieved - as I am positive that I could NOT have been the only observer.;39.4373999999999;-84.3609999999999
Multiple lights seen Over Monroe, Ohio.;2014-02-21 19:50:00;15 minutes;Multiple Lights seen Over Monroe Ohio. At approximately 7:50 PM EST / 19:50 Echo / 0:50 UTC - ZULU time, I was having a cigarette and star gazing.  I was staring at my neighbor's back yard across the way from mine towards the east north east - when I turned my head up, and towards the south east (ESE) of my position I suddenly noticed two bright, white, stationary objects side by side - somewhat resembling bright planets or stars ((sic)),such as Jupiter, Uranus, or Venus would naturally appear from a normal ground viewing vantage point).  The object on the right side being about 30 degrees lower in the sky than the other object on the left. The objects were a little brighter than Venus - and both actually somewhat resembled how Venus looks to a naked eye observer.  The objects were an unremarkable white color.  They reminded me of how two close binary stars would appear if they were close enough to our solar system to be that bright in the night sky.  They were brighter than Venus - and about as bright as an aircraft at night with it's fog beams / spot lights on. When I first saw them - I knew that they were not there a few moments earlier - and I also reasoned to myself that they could not be stars because they were simply too bright - and they were not planets because only Venus approaches that magnitude of brightness - and there is only one Venus.  My exact knee jerk first thought was  Those can't be planets - and there isn't a constellation that looks like that!. The higher object after a few seconds appeared to begin to very slowly and subtly move (or rather float or drift) upward - curving a little to the right, but the motion was again, very subtle and gradual. After a few minutes - maybe about three minutes - both objects then faded out completely, metaphorically as if under the influence of a dimmer switch - until they were visually un-trackable. I was stunned - and started to run back into the house when I decided to take a quick look around to see if maybe more were up there - and I glanced four, maybe five other objects at an extremely high altitude to the north east (NNE) swimming around each other - before finally separating and heading in a northerly direction (a few appeared to travel ENE, while at least two others looked to be headed due North).  These objects were dimmer and less perceivable than the objects that I had just witnessed a few seconds earlier - due again - to their greater altitude, but all were basically points of light.  One object appeared to have a more pinkish color hue than the others - and appeared to be either a tad bit brighter, or possibly larger - this object was one of I believe two that drifted away in a more Northward direction. The entire incident lasted from about 7:50PM EST (0:50 ZULU), to 8:05PM (1:00 ZULU). It is my desire to remain anonymous.

Orb like lights settling west of I-75.;2015-07-10 21:45:00;2 minutes;Orb like lights settling west of i75. My girl and I were leaving Cincinnati heading north on i75.  It was about a couple miles after we past the Cincinnati Outlet Malls.  We saw some strange activity west of the highway.  We agreed it wasn't an airplane or any sort of common explanation. We saw an orb it the sky. (Note: its not jupiter.)  It had me curious, so I keep my eyes on it. Then not too long after that three more orbs came out one at a time.  They would line up with the mother orb and then all go back inside til we saw the vision of one orb again.  That was all we saw because of cloud cover that night. I've seen recent videos of this particular UFO activity and this is what it reminded me of.;39.4373999999999;-84.3609999999999

Formation of red lights over Monroe, Ohio.;2017-09-09 22:30:00;15 minutes;Formation of red lights over Monroe, Ohio. Between the hours of approximately 10:30 pm EST and 10:45 pm EST, I observed a tight procession/single file flight of what could have been anywhere from eight to twelve red lights flying in an unremarkable yet eerie manner from the NNE to a SW direction.   I am not discounting the possibility that these could be aircraft perhaps heading towards either Florida or Texas for hurricane relief operations - but these aircraft had only a red light(s) as far as I could discern, and there were a lot of them following each other in a one by one procession.  They flew over neighboring Middletown, Ohio, which is next door to Monroe - at a relatively low altitude.   They did not originate from the proper direction of Wright Patterson AFB - but from farther North.  There were no unusual flight behaviors that would differentiate them from typical aircraft - but I could not hear any noise that I could directly associate with them.  The scene struck me as being very creepy. Neighborhood dogs were barking - but I was unsure if this was because of the objects - or because I was standing on my porch and they heard me making remarks such as, Oh my God! - and You must be ((word deleted)) kidding me!.;39.4373999999999;-84.3609999999999
