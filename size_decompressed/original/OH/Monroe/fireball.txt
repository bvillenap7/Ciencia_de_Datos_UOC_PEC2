Fireball/Flaring light over Monroe, Ohio.;2017-09-19 20:45:00;3-5 seconds;Fireball/Flaring light over Monroe, Ohio. I have already submitted a report for earlier this month pertaining to an earlier sighting - and I have just had another.  Tonight (09 - 19 - 2017) at approximately 8:45 PM EST, I was out in my back yard having a cigarette, when I saw what seemed to me - to be a very slow flaring light or high altitude explosion - orange in color - that began as a pin point of light that suddenly appeared - and then over a period of 1 to 1.5 seconds grew dramatically in brilliance, faded quickly down to a pin point once again - and then moved farther towards the north as it continued to fade until it was no longer visible.  the entire incident occurred at a high altitude (stratosphere?) well above the weather deck - maybe between 3000 to 8000 feet?  The position of the initial incident was North East, I would say towards northern Warren County Ohio. The incident duration was about 2.5 seconds.  I am not dismissing conventional explanations but it did NOT seem to be a meteor or space junk - as the object moved in a directed manner after flaring and fading - curving its course.   Also - both the flare up and the object's motion seemed too slow for a meteorite.  I am submitting sequenced graphics and an animated GIF file to NUFORC.;39.4373999999999;-84.3609999999999
