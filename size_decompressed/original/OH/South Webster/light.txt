Something is going on in southern Ohio.  A number of people are seeing an object in the sky. I have personally saw it on two different occaitoins.  There is a light that appears in the sky in the north and sometimes in the north west. The object lights up for approx. 15 seconds and then fades away. Sometimes it will appear in the north and then in about 10 to 15 mins later it will suddenly appear in the north west. The pattern is random. Last night there were four adults in our yard talking and it suddenly appeard again. We all saw it. I ran and got my binoculars but was unable to see clearly what the object looked like due to the short time that it was visable. Over the last 7 months there have also been sightings of 3 and somtimes 4 red flare colored lights hovering and sometimes moving in all different directions. They appear together and then move in dissimilar directions.;38.8184;-82.7154

A coworker and myself saw the same burnt orange objects in the northeastern sky at 18:29pm est. I have saw this befor and it was the same as I first discribed it then. We first saw a single burnt orange light in the northern sky. It was there only about 20 seconds or so then went out. Then in about a minute it was visable slightly left of it first location. After about 3 min's, we saw one,then two, and then three objects in the northwest. Same shape,color,and brightness. We were shocked. I was more than he because I thought that I would never see this again. The sky was crystal clear and no moon was visable. Objects were about at 45 degree's from horizon. There were jets in the area  but at a much higher altitude. Or so they seemed. No sounds were heard.Just a regular night. I have been watching the sky since I was a small boy and I have never saw anything like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports for same date.  PD));38.8184;-82.7154
