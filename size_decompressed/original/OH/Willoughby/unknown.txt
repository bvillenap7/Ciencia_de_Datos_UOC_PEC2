Bright, high flying, quick moving object moving south to north;2005-09-07 22:00:00;less than 5 minutes;Bright, high flying, quick moving object moving south to north My Husband, 23 year old Son and my self were out on our patio enjoying the beautiful night.  We have a wonderful large view of the sky from our back yard so we were just looking at the stars and chatting.  My husband went into the house after a while and my son and I were just looking at the sky when I saw what I thought a satellite must look like.  It was coming from the south in a straight line headed north.  It was extremely high in the sky, much higher than any air planes.  (We live in a flight path from Cuyahoga County airport, about 5 miles from the airport so we are used to seeing all kinds of planes, and we know their paths) There were other planes in the sky at the time, however they were much lower in the sky. I pointed out the object to my son and called to my husband who was just inside the house. We all were able to see it. The object was bright, kind of like a star, but was moving pretty quickly across the night sky, as I've said, south to north.  I've seen many meteors, and this was not moving that fast, also, it had no trail or sound.  It was just so high up in the sky that we couldn't make out what shape it was, however if I had to, I'd say it looked either square or round.  It did not appear long or V shaped.;41.6324999999999;-81.4033999999997
