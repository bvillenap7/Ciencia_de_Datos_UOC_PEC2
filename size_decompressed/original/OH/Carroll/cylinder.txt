It was spinning in all directions. It was behind the airplane, somewhat far back, going the same speed. Then, it sped up and as soon as it was at the plane, it veered off to the left and flew out of sight. I never heard any noises from it. It did seem to have a cloudiness form about it.;39.7948;-82.7136

((anonymous report));2019-10-08 18:40:00;5 minutes;I was outside and I looked up and saw a high altitude airplane going overhead.  As I was watching it, this white cylinder shaped object (smaller than the plane) was flying behind it, spinning in all directions, following at the same speed as the airplane.  Then, it sped up getting closer to the airplane.  As soon as it did, it veered off to the left and it flew out of sight. I didn't hear any sounds other than the plane.;39.7948;-82.7136
