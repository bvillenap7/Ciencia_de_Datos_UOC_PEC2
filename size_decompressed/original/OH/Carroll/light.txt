Very bright light over the Ohio Valley;2008-06-06 22:20:00;20 to 30 sec.;Very bright light over the Ohio Valley Bright light observed moving in a straight line from the WNW to the ESE direction.  Did not seem to be normal debris entering the atmosphere.  We did not notice it until it was straight above us.  We had no doubt about the significance of this sighting.  It was very unusual because of the slower speed, how bright it was and the absence of a trail.  The light source was so bright,looking up at it, it cast a four point star shape straight down. Observed it for 20 to 30 seconds before the light faded to nothing.  It faded out like a high power search light turned off.  When the light faded, no object could be seen in the clear sky.  No sound at all noticed.   We were at our home in the country side, with no lights on to hinder our sight.  No clouds present,star lit night and crescent moon.  Actually, we observed a satellite high in the sky above the path of the light after it extinguished.   I flew aircraft for years in the USAF and I strongly believe it was no manmade object.  Iâ€™m 40 years old and have seen many things in the night sky and this will be remembered as the most unusual.;39.7948;-82.7136
