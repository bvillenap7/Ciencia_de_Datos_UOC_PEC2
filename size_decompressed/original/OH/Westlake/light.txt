At 21:15 on October 15, 1998, I was traveling west on I-90, approximately 2 miles west of the Crocker-Bassett exit. A light appeared at 10 o'clock which caught my attention because it looked to be an aircraft coming in for a landing. The problem with that was that Cleveland Hopkins Airport was 10 miles west of my position. I was traveling at 60 mph and the light maintained its 10 0'clock position throughout the sighting. It was a clear night and having lived within 5 miles of Hopkins Airport for the last 33 years I know what a plane looks like at night. As the craft passed overhead I heard no sound and could only make out six perfectly round, bright lights arranged in a circle. I did not see it land, but in 33 years of watching airplanes I never say a light configuration like this.;41.4519;-81.9209999999999

I saw a green streak of light moving very quickly west at a height of (best guess) a few thousand feet. The light moved very fast and was shaped long and skinny. The light was very bright and it was a green/dark teal color. I saw it for a few seconds before it disappeared into the dark sky. It moved was faster than an airplane and the shape was something I've never seen before.;41.4519;-81.9209999999999
