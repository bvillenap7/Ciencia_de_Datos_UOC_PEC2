Liberty Ohio and all the way north on route 3/36 south to updike rd. west home my Girlfriend and  seen 2 separate objects which seemed to be about 1/2 to 1 mile apart from one another, traveling the same speed heading east to west and very, very slow.  I honestly cannot say how big they were nor how high they were flying as we never got that close. Both of the objects were triangular shaped and had 3 very large, kind of dim red lights on each tips of the triangle.   as of about 11:20 PM they looked as tho they were right over route 3/36 just about 2 mile north of Centerburg.  At the speed they were traveling I would have to guess they would be around the sparta area now 25 minutes later -- That is just a guess tho.;40.2854;-82.6792999999999
