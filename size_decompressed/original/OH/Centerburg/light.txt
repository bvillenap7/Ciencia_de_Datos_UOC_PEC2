My friend and I were going to go out and look for UFOs one night.  We doubted we would see anything but we went out anyway.  It was cold.  Probably around 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.  We were about to go in when I saw a pulsating red light to the East.  I pointed it out to my friend and he thought it looked odd too.  We knew it was a UFO when we studied its movement.  It would speed up and then slow down as if it had brakes.  Not like a regular airplane.  Then right before we lost track of it.  It deployed another smaller red light and it fell downward.  It was amazing.  I had never seen anything like it before.  We were so distracted by the probe that when we finally looked up back to where the ship was before, it was gone.  It was very astounding.

Moved towards the west.  Moved against background of stars.   Was an airplane in the sky at the same time, this light was very different from the plane (no blinking, appeared much bigger).;40.2854;-82.6792999999999
