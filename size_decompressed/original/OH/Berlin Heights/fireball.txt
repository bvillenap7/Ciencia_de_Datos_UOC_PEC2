I was driving to work and saw 3 bright lights in the northern sky.  They seemed stationary just above the horizon. They had a yellowish glow to them. They were positioned at the same level, say, one at 11 oclock, one at 12 oclock, and one at 1 oclock. It takes me about 45 minutes to drive to work and they were in the sky the duration of my drive.
