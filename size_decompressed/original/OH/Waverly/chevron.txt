It looked like a faint white ribbon.  As it got closer I could tell that it was several seprate faint white lights shaped like a boomerang with a little bit of a nose on the front of it.  I would estimate at least 12 lights on the front of it.  It flew over my head very fast,no noise what so ever.  This thing was huge,very eerie. If a 747 was flying over my head at 100ft,thats how big this thing was.  I dont know the altitude of it,but it seemed to be very high in the sky.  I could make out the shape of it on the front edge but could se nothing behind it.  As it flew over my head it blocked out the stars, then I could tell it was a gigantic boomerang.  It proceeded to fly south and dissapeared in the southern sky.;39.1264000000001;-83.0048999999999
