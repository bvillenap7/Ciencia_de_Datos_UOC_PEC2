Bright orange window shape and cresent shaped object.;2014-10-24 19:40:00;7 minutes;Bright orange window shape and cresent shaped object. I saw a bright orange object witha black cross through it in the eastern sky.  It looked like a brightly lit window in the sky. It stayed there still for a few minutes then disappeared.  I waited there for about 5 minutes to see if it would show up again.  Then a plane came through the area and when it got to where the orange light was a bright cresent shaped object appeared above it for just about 5 seconds and then disappeared.   The plane just kept on flying in a southwestern direction.  Just for comparison the international space station flew over about 10 minute later and both previous object were way brighter it.  They both were the brightest objects in the sky.;39.1264000000001;-83.0048999999999

I had been looking around to the south and didn't notice anything odd.   I turn to look in the northern sky to also see nothing.  I had been looking away from the south for maybe one minute, to which I return to look in that direction.  I see the biggest flying object I've ever seen, it was the shape of a boomerang with the silhouette lit by six red lights.   The object was being followed by a single red light that stayed the exact same distance from the larger object the whole time I saw them, it was like the smaller light was being towed.  It was in my observable sky for about 2 minutes until it went behind the tree line to the east.   I remained outside for an hour and it never returned.
