reddish orangish soft ring 300 yards diameter;2006-07-08 21:00:00;20 min;reddish orangish soft ring 300 yards diameter at first an object was seen in the southern sky which seemed to be a glowing white object just like it came out of nowhere. as we were taking a pontoon boat ride around the lake one of the 10 or 12 passengers said 'what was that' we brushed it off as a military flare or something. as we continued our tour we noticed in the northern sky about 15 min later a round ring of what seemed like a soft lit orange reddish with a tint of yellow outer ring that got brigter as we watched. it was very low altitude approximately 1/2 mile away we watched in amazement for around 15 minutes as it tilted slightly. my daughter who was holding her baby said to me 'well i guess this is for real' as i turn the boat around not knowing what else to do my daughter said the ship had square or rectangle windows or an outline that appeared to be. as we returned home i couldn't keep from looking back, the object mellowed out or left and i haven't seen it again. it took me this long to respond because we all said to each other ,we seen what we saw and we'll always know what we seen, lets keep it  that way. one of the group said it was a military flare or something, and there were jets flying around afterwards, but this was our experience, thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
