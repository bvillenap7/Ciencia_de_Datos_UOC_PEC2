Its was night time out and around here we are use to fighter jets flying and such and ive seen helicopters so im no stranger to what is above me  but what really excited me was that of how it was moving and there was ZERO SOUND  i heard nothing then it started to move it started to move up and down then left to right and just kept repeating that same pattern i wasnt able to be near myphone so i yelled for my GF and then  she seen what it is thats got me all worked up she was in disbelief to what she seen .  But yes it was a bright ball of light that just moved up and down and left to right then it started to go farther below the trees to the point of where i was losing site then it was gone as if it was never there . Im a really level hea! ded person but what i seen  was not a plane or any other known structure in the skies;39.1264000000001;-83.0048999999999
