Brightly orange fireball with small objects coming out of it.;2013-09-21 23:00:00;30 seconds;Brightly orange fireball with small objects coming out of it. I was driving East on the Ohio turnpike outside of Delta, OH, when I noticed above me a round, brightly glowing orange ball.  It was moving slowly across the sky from North to South.  I leaned over the steering wheel to help focus on the object and get a more detailed look and I noticed small, orange balls falling off/coming out of the ‘craft’ 3 or 4 at a time.  The object dispersed these balls at least twice before it passed out of my field of vision.  Its speed was relatively slow.;41.5572;-83.994
