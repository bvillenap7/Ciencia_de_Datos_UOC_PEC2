Yellow round ball of light which made S shaped manueuvers.;2011-07-09 22:00:00;45 seconds;Yellow round ball of light which made S shaped manueuver. We were on our scooter, traveling south on County Rd 7, approaching County Rd H.   We both saw a large yellow round ball of light high in the air, probably 3 to 4000 feet.  It seemed to be approaching us then it made several S shaped maneuvers dropping toward the earth, and appeared to approach us again and then disappeared.   It was a half moon and cloudless night.   We were preparing to watch local fireworks which had not started yet, and were much lower to the ground, when they did start five minutes later.   In relation to the moon, it was perhaps 1/10th the size of the half-moon that night.;41.5572;-83.994
