Amber lights.;2007-11-09 22:00:00;90 min;Amber lights At approx 22:00 I observed an amber light at about 30 degrees in the northern sky.  The light was stationary for about 4 sec.  As I was watching another amber light moved out from the first.  The second moved for about 2 seconds and stopped.  As the second one was stopping the first went out.   (These lights do not just go out but act like someone has put a lid on a candle in a jar, they fade out)   The second light spawned a third light and the process was repeated 2 more times.   The whole process lasted around 20 seconds. For the next hour and a half the lights were random.  I would see one every 10-15-20 min lighting up 1 at a time everywhere in the northern sky for 3 to 6 seconds then fading out.;38.6286;-82.8197
