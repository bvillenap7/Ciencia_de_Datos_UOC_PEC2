Object appeared to be a dark grey, somewhat oval and wider than it was tall.  The visual size near the tree line was about half an inch, and as it rose, it became smaller until it looked like a star and disappeared.  The oval was bisected by a line that looked like a tutu, extending out from the sides of the oval, perhaps going all the way around the object.  The line was composed of alternating red and green lights which did not blink.  No sound was heard.  The lower portion of the oval appeared to have a darker triangular shape in its center. The object was observed for almost 5 minutes as it gradually rose into the sky and disappeared.  This object was definitely not a plane, and moved more like a helicopter since it moved straight upâ€¦but without rotor blades and was silent.  An aircraft was seen and heard flying in the sky behind the observer moving in a southerly direction. Observed by 18 year old female from driveway after returning from dance instruction.;41.1525999999998;-81.6300000000003
