woman called my home in panic.  ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain anonymous.  May be hoaxed report.  PD));2005-03-31 00:01:00;5-10min;woman called my home in panic. She lives by herself on farm w/no near-by neighbors. she won't report this to officials for fear of being thought 'crazy'. My wife is talking to her now to calm her down. This lady is credable. I am reporting this to you in case others are reporting in the area and you may be tracking these craft. From her story she glanced at the window while watching tv and saw a blinking light. She went to the window, in the dark, and saw three ufos with a horizonal light band of different colors flashing along the side of the craft high above the ground. the size was a spread hand at arm length each. The top one move to the left and joined two more farther left. She could not move because she couldn't believe what she was seeing. after a while she could hardly breathe and felt a pressure on her chest from being scared and ran to the phone to call us. when my wife asked if they were still there she looked out her windows but it was just dark with stars. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous, so we are not able to contact him/her.  We would like to have an investigator talk to the witness.
