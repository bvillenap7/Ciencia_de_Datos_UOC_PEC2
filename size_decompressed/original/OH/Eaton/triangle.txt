One over the other a small distance.  It was very cloudy and there wasn't any visible stars or moon. They would get real bright then start flashing like a strobe light. I went and got my boyfriend and he saw them just before they faded out. This isn't the first time I have saw strange objects over us. After midnight most nights there is a lot of air crafts back and forth all night but barely any at all during the day?;39.7424999999999;-84.6513000000002
