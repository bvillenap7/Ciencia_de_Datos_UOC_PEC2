Bright  no blinking point of light travelling East at constant speed;2009-03-17 21:16:00;4 minutes;Bright  no blinking point of light travelling East at constant speed An point of light appeared in the western sky low on the horizon, maybe 15 degrees above the horizon traveling ENE. At first it looked pink (like it was in the light of the setting sun) but as it continued ENE and rose to about 30 degrees above the horizon it gradually changed to a bright white. It's speed was constant and about the same speed as the commercial planes flying in the area. There were 6 aircraft in the immediate vicinity of the object and it appeared that one was following it for about 15 seconds while it was in the western sky. My husband got binoculars and we both looked at it through the binoculars but all we saw was a larger point of light. The object was silent and left no contrail  There were no blinking red or green riding lights on this craft. I'd say it was magnitude -1 or so-it was bright.  It traveled across the northern sky heading east and was about 40 degrees above the northern horizon. As it got into the eastern sector of the sky it dimmed a bit and than disappeared  I checked to see if this was the ISS but there was no fly over of that or any other satellite in my area at 21:16.;39.7424999999999;-84.6513000000002
