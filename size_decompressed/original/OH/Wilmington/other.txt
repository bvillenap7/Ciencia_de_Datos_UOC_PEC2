This is an open corn field with Nothing around.  I drove another half mile then turned south and then noticed an emensely bright white light going same direction a quater mile to my left then I turned West and looked back and it was still visible.  I drove another two miles before turning left south again and seen the light heading south west.  I continue driving a quarter before turning into my driveway and as I backed up to my garage facing south I noticed the light floating as it seemed to slowly come my direction.  I watched it for 2-3 min before remembering I'd purchased a camcorder that arrived while I was in Va. and went and grabbed it and recorded it for quite somd time.  This was thee Brightest white light I'd Ever seen in the sky and was amazed when I zoomed in and started to record.  I've attached 4 stills off the flip out screen from my phone cam, so a pic from a pic. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
