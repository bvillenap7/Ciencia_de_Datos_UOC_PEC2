Orange sphere shot straight into the sky very fast.;2014-07-13 13:00:00;3 seconds;orange sphere shot straight into the sky very fast My wife and I were driving south on interstate 71.  we saw a bright orange sphere shoot from the ground straight up and into the sky and disappear into the atmosphere.  It was so fast.  Nothing of this world could have went as fast as it did.   Makes me nervous to report this because the littl greys took me from my room when i was ten in Yellow Springs, Ohio.

Went outside to look at a plane flying over our area we had been tracking on a flight radar app, caught eye ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-11 22:00:00;5-7 minutes;Went outside to look at a plane flying over our area we had been tracking on a flight radar app, caught eye of 1st orb and considered the possibility of it being a simple satellite, then 16 more followed one after the other with about 3-5 seconds in between them coming into view.  They did not appear on this radar app therefore it is not a typical flight.  After flying through a small cloud they never re appeared again.  No sound, no navigation lights.;39.4522;-83.8410000000002
