Bright Light high up in the sky.  Yellowish/Orange.  Much bigger than a shooting star. Was moving southward once it appeared and then completely disappeared for about 10-15 seconds then reappeared just as bright but slightly lower to the horizon then the first time seen.  It vanished each time like it went behind clouds however there were no clouds in the sky.  A clear sky, of which one can see the stars very clearly. The second viewing only lasted about 10 seconds and vanished just like the first time. It reappeared for the third time but in a different path to which it was previously moving and much further away like it was a totally different object.  The appearence was exactly the same.  It stayed the same brightness for about 5-7 seconds and vanished.  The size of the light was very large.  It did not blink or change colors at all.  The windows of the vehicle were closed so whether it had sound, we could not tell.  There were other planes in the sky at the same time so we hope someone else had seen what we seen.  Truely amazing and we had never seen anything like it before!;39.1669;-83.6016
