At 22:22 while standing on front porch, we saw a bright round object that looked like a fireball without a tail approximately 1/4 to 1/2 the size of the moon or a better comparison would be an actual basketball about 15ft above you.  It was Bright orange/red.  It traveled in a north east direction at an extremely fast speed.  We thought it may be some type of aircraft crashing.   We waited but there was no signs of impact or noise associated with what we saw.   We contacted local law enforcement and after they checked surrounding counties stated that there were no reports of a crash or any reports of military activity.  Afterwards at 22:55 we saw another object with the same description but traveling in a south west direction with the same starting point as the first sighting.  We looked up various web sites to see if there were any kind of meteor showers for our area of vision and there were none listed.  We then called the NUFORC hotline.;39.1669;-83.6016
