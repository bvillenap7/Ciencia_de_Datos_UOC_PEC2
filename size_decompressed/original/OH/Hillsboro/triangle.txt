3 triangular white lights a few hundred feet above treeline and relatively close distance;2004-11-06 20:30:00;2 minutes;3 triangular white lights a few hundred feet above treeline and relatively close distance Clear night, Turn onto East New Market Road and off in the distance I noticed 3 Triangular white lights which appeared to be one half to one mile away maybe three to eight hundred feet above tree line directly east. They caught my attention as I have a large security light and these were some what brighter. At first I thought they may be aircaft landing lights as Airborne express is 25 miles north of my home. Frequent fly overs late at night are the norm. I also have worked there and these lights were spaced to far apart to be a aircraft. ALso as close as they appeared I saw no wing lights and no noise was heard as should have happened with the estimation of the distance from me.  NO operations go on at Airborne this time of the week. I thought maybe it could be a training flight from there and got out of my car to await the flyover. Suddenly they just disappeared. THis is in a rural area and I heard a number of dogs barking off in the distance.;39.1669;-83.6016
Triangular shaped crafts circle and jump space.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-11 19:00:00;25 minutes;Triangular shaped crafts circle and jump space. Three witnesses among family--First sighted on the way home, starting with two in a far distance, and continued as we pulled in the drive.  Two triangular shaped crafts circled our complex about 5 or 6 times within 20 minutes.  One had seven blinking lights and the other had only three the one with seven blinking lights was leading the other craft the whole time. At one point, the leading craft approached a normal commercial airplane and disappeared, jumping from above to the left of us in around one second.  They then went around the back of the house and completely disappeared.  Aircraft noises separate from the crafts themselves were heard, possible reasoning behind circling such as watching or chasing them.
