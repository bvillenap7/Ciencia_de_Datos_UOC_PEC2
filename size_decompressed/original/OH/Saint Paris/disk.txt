They seen a red light approaching from above some pine trees.  My daughter turned around and it turned bright red and hovered over a dirt pile right i front of her.  She started screaming at my neice to turn around and when she did the object spun in circles and got brighter.  They told their friend to look and when he raised his phone to take a picture it was gone.  They all started running towards the drive in the cemetery to go home when they seen my neices dad coming to pick them up.  They were crying and really scared and he asked what was wrong.  When the kids told him, he said he seen the red light in the sky too and wandered what the hell it was...my daughter told me that when she seen it that her arm went numb and she started to run...my niece said her leg went numb and she started to run also.
