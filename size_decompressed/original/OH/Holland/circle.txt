WEDNESDAY MORNING MAY 7, 2008, PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS, BETWEEN BREAKS IN CLOUDS, SPOTTED LARGE BALL OF WHITE LIGHT TRAVELING AT SLOWER SPEED THAN WHAT A SHOOTING STAR TRAVELS, TRAVELING FROM THE EAST DIRECTION TO WEST. THE BALL OF LIGHT DID NOT APPEAR AS IF IT WERE COMING FROM BEHIND THE CLOUDS, IT APPEARED MID-WAY IN THE CLEARING OF THE CLOUDS THEN DISAPPEARED BEHIND, NOT TO RE-APPEAR IN NEXT CLEARING. ALSO, LOOKED LIKE IT WAS JUST ABOVE THE CLOUDS SURFACE, NOT HIGH UP INTO THE SKY. WERE THERE ANY OTHER REPORTS OF SIGHTINGS AROUND SAME TIME, DATE, LOCATION? WAS THIS A METEOR? A SATELLITE?;41.6197;-83.7282

I could see three or four round lights close together from the road, as I turned down my street i seen more lights, as I was right underneath it the craft turned I could then see that it was a UFO.   I have never seen anything like it.  It took off but it was floating in the middle of my street, for a few mins before I got there.  But I am 100% sure it was a UFO.;41.6197;-83.7282
