Orange, spherical light moving erratically.;2013-08-12 21:30:00;:30;Orange, spherical light moving erratically. I live in a rural area.  Frequently I go for long walks at night.  Tonight I was almost back to my driveway when I noticed 2 lights in the Southwestern sky underneath about 80% cloud cover.  The one to the left was a blinking navigation light traveling in a linear fashion - obviously a plane.  The one to the right was larger, spherical, and glowing orange.  It was slightly larger than a plane's navigation light would appear. I watched the light and noticed it moving quickly and erratically, like an insect around a lamp.  The light continued this kind of frenetic motion predominately upwards before disappearing into the clouds. About a month prior I had a similar, initial sighting.  That time it was much higher up and directly overhead.  I could pick out jets and stars as a reference, but this orange light moved erratically in a way that I had never seen before.  I watched it for what felt like a solid 10 minutes - just buzzing around up there nonsensically.  I realized just how high up it was when the light traveled behind a whispy cloud (one of those upper level cirrus clouds).  At that point I went back to the house. A friend of mine observed something similar in late July, but I can't speak for him.;41.7295;-80.7493
