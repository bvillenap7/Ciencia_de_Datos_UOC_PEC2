Star-like object that split in 2 then formed cigar shape!!;2001-09-03 18:00:00;3 to 5 minutes;Star-like object that split in 2 then formed cigar shape!! This happened over this past Labor Day weekend. My husband, Myself and our 3 kids went camping at Berlin lake in Berlin, OH . On sunday around 6:00 o'clock we took our bikes and went to the camp playground. It was my husbands turn to watch the kids so i went and took a seat on the ground by the bikes.As I was sitting there I noticed a Jet up in the sky by the way it was a beautiful day not a cloud in the sky. The jet had a contrail behind it nothing that I haven't seen before!! But what caught my eye was the STAR that appeared above the contrail really really bright!! At first i thought it was Venus but then it was only 6:: PM and stars don't come out that early!@ Then it started moving it moved in a straight line  as it passed over me this Star split in 2 and what was really weird was when I looked at the 2 split stars they had a distortion around them like little wavy lines then as quick as they split they got back together and formed a cigar shape silvery white in color!!!!!! That's when I went running to get my husband I was calling him the whole time bit the JO didn't answer so when I went to him I told him to look and it was gone!! Weirdest thing I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;40.5629;-81.7992
