Soundless cigar shaped object, dim lighting.;2017-10-27 22:00:00;>5 minutes;Soundless cigar shaped object, dim lighting. My husband first saw the cigar shaped object in the sky.  He ran in and got me.  When I made it outside all I could catch was the back end of it going over the tree tops.  Through the trees I could see a dim flickering, almost like the paper lanterns, there was no sound, and the object was huge, at least the size of a greyhound bus.  This has been about the 3rd time since the beginning of summer since we have seen these objects.  Was not able to get clear video.;41.076;-80.5979000000001
