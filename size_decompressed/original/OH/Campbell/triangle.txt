My passenger and I saw what looked to be a very bright star in the night sky, and noticed it was slowly decreasing its altitude.  It descended from the sky until it was what seemed like right above our car.  I could make out an unusual shape from our sunroof.  It was a triangle-shaped object with bright light surrounding all sides.   The light was not a cool blue, but a warmer light.  It was radiant- as if for a moment someone had shined a flashlight in your eyes.  We know it was no plane or helicopter as there was dead silence above us.  It was moving very slowly, still quite a distance away.  For it to descend that fast only to hover above the road before moving away in the opposite direction is a very odd thing for a plane or helicopter to do.;41.076;-80.5979000000001
