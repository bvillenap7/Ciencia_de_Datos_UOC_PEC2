At 330am this morning 4/22/2020 I went outside to look at the meteor showers. I was looking around the area they suggested (around Vega) I looked up and saw what looked to be 3 orange orbs…  Lights…? Or something. I thought it was some sort of meteor or something at first.  It was moving slowly and smoothly.  I thought maybe it was a low flying plane, but this was significantly larger, completely silent, and only a few hundred feet high.  It kept slowly gliding across the sky until it darted across and faded. There were 3 in a triangle pattern.  I usually don’t buy into this kind of stuff, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t completely baffled.  It was too large for a plane.  I have experience being around c17s and c130s…  This thing made those look like a child's play toy.  I couldn’t hear anything from it, which is bizzare for how low it appeared to be.  I could hear planes from much further away. I've served in the military and for 8 years now I've been in law enforcement.  I'd like to think I have my wits about me and I'm able to process things rationally, but I've never seen anything like this in my life. I was the only one awake in the house and by the time I noticed it, it began departing North towards Milan.;41.2394999999999;-82.5974999999999
