Glowing ball sighted over the Catawba Point waters of Lake Erie;2010-10-09 21:15:00;4 min.;Glowing ball sighted over the Catawba Point waters of Lake Erie the object seemingly came from the land or out of the water in the bay area near catawba point and gem beach. it apeared to be 10-20 ft above the water. it was an orange glowing globe shape the color of fire. it made no noise and left no trails.it was no more than a mile away i know this because the background was the trees further down the lake coastline. at first glance we thought it was a light on a boat behind the break wall. it kind of had a slight bounce to it as if it was riding the waves. it also was only moving a few mile per hour at this point. it cuntinued to gain speed and altitude rapidly.it went up to maybe 500 ft. and you could see its reflection on the water. we watched it move in a northeast direction out over and past kelly's island. it took aprox. 4 min. until it dissapeared into the distance. a very interesting point is that an hr later a lady rode up to the point on her golf cart where we had watched the object. and says we saw a ufo she then confirmed that she and others saw the same thing from another vantage point in the park. my brother and his wife witnessed the same type of sighting two weeks earlier from the same location. and took photos of the object. interestingly my brother had just been showing these pics 30 min before this event;41.5146000000003;-82.9390999999997
