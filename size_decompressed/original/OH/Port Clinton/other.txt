What i thought was a plane stopped moving. I thought it was odd and kept watching this white glowing object, if i had to pick a shape it was circular,or a big ball or orb of light. Slowly it began to move again, but in ways i haven't seen an aircraft do before, moving slowly in an almost zig zag pattern, or something like a figure 8. As time past from below the first white glowing orb object what appeared to be a shooting star flew past the sky, it was almost an instant, less than a second before that was gone.  Over the half hour i watched this glowing orb object  from a few miles away from it's left my eyes picked up on something else.  I had to focus my eyes to get a good look.  what appeared to be a shimmering  crescent moon shape. if you looked away from it it would almost disappear from view completely.  Over time i noticed two more of the shimmering crescent moon shaped objects.  One seeming to be a few miles below the glowing orb object, the other a few miles to the right,  Bringing the total count of the shimmering crescent moon shaped objects to 3. it was hard to focus on them, it was almost like you had to look directly at the crescent moon objects,or they wouldn't pick up on my vision, at least not in my peripheral vision.  I noticed these shimmering crescent moon objects were traveling around the white orb object moving counter clockwise around it.  i watched this from 4:10 am to around 4:40 am, roughly.  I didn't see what happened or where the objects went! , i was rather shaken up by seeing this and scurried back to my house before a climax or finishing outcome to this event. when i went inside i looked out my kitchen window i saw one of the shimmering crescent moon objects one last time before i got online and started typing this report up.;41.5146000000003;-82.9390999999997

In the distance was a red orange glow it came toward me not fast but like it was floating toward me about 200 ft in the sky or more! It continued to come toward me. The glow took shape of a C. It stopped dead in the sky took a right 90 turn then continued a little bit and stopped again.the went right a little more then went back left the stopped and went back the way it come. I would of woke my partner but I thought it might disappear. It was truly breath taking! I only told couple people because I didn't want them to think I'm carzy!;41.5146000000003;-82.9390999999997
