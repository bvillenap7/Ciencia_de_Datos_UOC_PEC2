I quickly realized it wasn't a star.  It was brighter, larger and it was blinking, changing from red to green to white.  It was stationary, not moving at all. I then took out my binoculars and watched it, still, it didn't move.  I had my neighbors come out to get their opinion.  You could easily see the colors changing with the naked eye.  They were as puzzled as I as to what it could be.  Cloud cover came in and we lost the visual.;41.5146000000003;-82.9390999999997
