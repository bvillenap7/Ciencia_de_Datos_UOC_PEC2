5-10 Triangular and Spherical UFOs hovering over the Bay;2011-01-10 21:30:00;Stayed and watched for on;5-10 Triangular and Spherical UFOs hovering over the Bay Around 21:30,  my sister-in-law and I looked up to the sky and spotted a triangular aircraft hovering quite low to the ground over the Bay in Marblehead, OH. It had red lights and blinked a blue/green color. I pulled over to the side of the road and looked up again to see nearly 5 of the same aircrafts spread evenly across the sky (I would estimate 3 miles apart from one another). We then saw spherical objects with red blinking lights, revolving around the triangular aircrafts. They were very quick and, in my opinion, flew across the sky as a fish would in water. There was not a straight path, it zig zagged through the sky. A few nights prior to this, my husband and I slammed on our brakes leaving Nagoya (in Port Clinton) on Lightner Rd. when we saw a VERY low spherical aircraft with red lights, spinning for nearly 30 seconds before it took off. It sped up, then stopped IMMEDIATELY and disappeared. These aircrafts resembled the one from that night. My sister-in-law and I sat for nearly an hour looking up at the sky at these crafts and they made no sound at all and did not move. They were stagnant, only the spherical crafts moving around the sky. Weâ€™ve seen many more UFOs in this same area on other nights, it seems as if they stay around the bay area and near Davis Besse Power Plant. They are very low to the ground, but very quick and I was unable to snap a photo of any of them.;41.5146000000003;-82.9390999999997
