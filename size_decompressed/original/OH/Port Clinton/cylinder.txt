3 large cylinder shaped crafts flying near Lake Erie;2013-04-08 17:00:00;20 minutes;3 large cylinder shaped crafts flying near Lake Erie On Monday April 8th 2013 My family and I witnessed a large cylinder shaped craft, grey in color, flying overhead.  It was a very clear day and there was no noise whatsoever associated with this craft.  It flew at a constant speed and left no chem-trail behind it. 6 minutes later another cylinder shaped craft flew the exact same flight path as the first followed closely by a 3rd object.  I was terrified they were missiles but obviously they were not.;41.5146000000003;-82.9390999999997
