Reddish Orange low altitude crafts in uniform flight pattern;2014-07-04 23:00:00;3 minutes;Reddish Orange low altitude crafts in uniform flight pattern I saw a bright red light which apeared to be a low altitude plane.  Through my window the solid reddish orange light seemed to have a 5 pointed star shape.  The craft traveled a steady speed.  There were no blinking lights, just a solid color.  It wasn't a normal light so I watched it travel from the NW to the SE but as it approached the SE horizon the lights turned off and the craft went dark. I then witnessed three other identical crafts traveling the same speed and flight path aprox 20 second to 40 seconds apart.  As one would come close to the SE horizon and go dark the next would appear in the NW horizon.  It was difficult to judge altitude, but I would say they were traveling higher than typical helicopters but much lower than commercial jets.  We are close to a small airport where single prop planes are constantly in the sky and we are also in the flight path of a regular helicopter. These was no noise to suggest either of these types of crafts.  Along with the lack of noise, the coloration, speed, flight path, and number of craft ruled out these possibilities.;41.1701000000001;-81.4423999999999
