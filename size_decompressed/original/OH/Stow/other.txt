Mysterious & Beautiful Bright White Lights.;2019-05-21 04:48:00;3 seconds;Mysterious & Beautiful Bright White Lights. I work the midnight shift, and I happen to look up into the sky (facing north) just below the handle of the big dipper (ursa major) I saw what looked like a comet.  It was a big bright white light as bright as the moon was last night.   Then in an instant it went from one to four balls of light falling kind of in a check mark shape, and as quickly as it appeared, it was gone.   I've tried to search and even posted to social media to see if anyone else saw this, of course most people I know are in bed at that time.  I wish it would have lasted long enough to get capture footage.  It was beautiful what ever it was.;41.1701000000001;-81.4423999999999

The object was at about 60 degree elevation.  I observed it for a minute or so with my naked eye and it appeared to be similar to a satellite tumbling in space, reflecting the sunlight as it tumbled.  With my binoculars it appeared to have a linear shape but very thin, almost a sliver.  It appeared to moving very slowly to the east.  I observed it for a few more minutes when a passenger jet flew nearby.  It was obvious that the object was far above the jet's contrails.  After about 10 minutes, the object suddenly accelerated to the south for a short distance, then made a 90 degree turn towards the earth.  My house blocked further observation of the object.  The reason I am reporting this is because of the sudden acceleration and changes in direction the object made.   I saw all of this in broad daylight under mostly sunny skies.;41.1701000000001;-81.4423999999999
