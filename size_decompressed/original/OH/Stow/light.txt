Very bright light that was in the eastern horizon moving west, the light 'turned off' then reapered in the western sky seconds later.;2004-08-14 22:15:00;5 minutes;Very bright light that was in the eastern horizon moving west, the light 'turned off' then reapered in the western sky seconds later. I was working saturday 08-14-04 patroling an appartment community, at 2215hrs I was standing outside in aparking lot star gazing when I saw this bright light approaching from the east.  At first I thought it was an aircraft but then realized there was no sound and if it were landing lights on an aircraft at say airliner cruzing altitudes it would not have been as bright as it was.  The light was moving at a steady pace (like an airliner) when it suddenly dissapered and then reapered on the western horizon just a moment later (3 seconds, entirely too fast to be an airplane) this time the light had stopped moving.  it stayed at its present spot for about three minutes and then it appered to start climbing straight up. (not going east to west or north to south just straight up)  the light was getting smaller as it climbed untill it looked like a faint distant star and moved at an amazing speed back to the eastern horizon and disapered.  I was about to contact dispatch however I felt really awkward and did not want to lose credit or respect with my peers.  However, since this event two days ago I have been losing sleep thinking about it and decided to do some internet research and thats when I found your web site and this reporting section.;41.1701000000001;-81.4423999999999
Big bright light that didn't move then dimmed into two littles lights and moved away and disappeared.;2013-08-15 12:00:00;2 minutes;Big bright light that didn't move then dimmed into two littles lights and moved away and disappeared. I was standing at the end of my driveway when I looked down the street and into the sky where I saw a bright light which I thought was a star.  I went up my driveway and the light got brighter, I knew it was a plane when it didn't move or make any noise and how big it was..   I called my boyfriend over to help me indentify what I was looking at.  We both started at it until it messed with out eyes.  The longer we stated at it, the blurry it got.   My boyfriend went into the grass to try and get a better view of what it was.  The light dimmed way down into two small lights then moved at a normal speed to the right.  I tried to follow the lights to where I could see behind the trees, but it disappeared.;41.1701000000001;-81.4423999999999
