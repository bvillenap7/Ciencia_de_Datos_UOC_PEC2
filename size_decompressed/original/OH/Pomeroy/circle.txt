First of all I'm not crazy,  This morning 10-22-08 I was driving east bount on state rte 7 in OH at about 5:30am.  All Of a sudden I saw a bright almost neon green round shaped object that seemed to be falling from space at an incredible rate of speed.  Behind it was a contrail that was white.  It reminded me of the footage when the space shuttle broke up and and fell to earth except it was one solid object. I have never seen anything remoteley like it before. The object was moving from what looked like north to south at approximateley a 45 degree angle. I'd like to think it was a meteor, but the green color has me second guessing. I don't know maybe meteor's can be green ((NUFORC Note:  Similar sighting in Washington State, at about the same time.  May be explained by the Orionid Meteor shower, which is taking place, currently.  PD));39.0635;-82.0367
