Large brilliant light with no sound and disappeared.;2014-07-26 00:15:00;2 minutes;Large brilliant light with no sound and disappeared After doing late night chores and coming back up to the house, we noticed a brilliant ball of light about the size of a helicopter going across the tops of our woods.   This light was heading north along SR 61.  There was no sound or flashing lights from it.   It progressed out across the field then shot up into a cloud and disappeared.  The dogs noticed, as they were barking as it was coming down across the tree tops.   Could not see anything other than the blinding white light that was produced.;41.1035;-82.6043
