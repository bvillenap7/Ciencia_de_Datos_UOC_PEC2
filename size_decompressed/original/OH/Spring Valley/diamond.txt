very bright diamond shape light hovered 100 feet in front of me near Spring Valley Ohio;2008-10-26 19:50:00;4 minutes maybe;very bright diamond shape light hovered 100 feet in front of me near Spring Valley Ohio I was on my way home, which out in the country about 3-4 miles from the small town of Spring Valley Ohio.  I traveled east on Roxanna New Burlington Road turned right or south on Pence Jones Road, I zipped around the first turn and caught this light off to my left. I slowed my car down, the light was quite a ways away but it was hurting my eyes so I brought my car to a stop. On the west side of Pence Jones Road is woods, and the left or east side is an open field of harvested soybeans. The light rapidly came closer to me and hovered over the field, it hurt my eyes so much I was holding up my hand to shield my eyes. It hovered maybe a 100 feet in front of me for maybe 2 minutes like it was looking at me, its light pulsated many times, my car shut off like the battery died. I could feel heat coming off the light. There was no sound, I started getting scared and it abruptly shot up into the sky and was gone. It very much scared me and I have not been able to sleep.;39.6065;-84.0227
