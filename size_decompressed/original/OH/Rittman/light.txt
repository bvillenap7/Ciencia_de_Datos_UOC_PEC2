Fast moving white light.;2013-10-10 19:00:00;1 minute;Fast moving white light. I was at the ball fields picking my child up from practice at 7:00 pm when I saw a bright light moving across the sky.   At first it looked like a star but it was moving very fast.   It moved from left to right, stopped suddenly then went back to the left before it disappeared.;40.9698;-81.7786
