5 bright, silent spheres.;2017-09-09 21:37:00;5 minutes;5 bright, silent spheres. At 9:37 pm my husband and I were sitting in our backyard having a bonfire, when the first of five round, bright things flew overhead.  It was low, bright orange, silent, and moving in a straight line at a high speed.   Then as soon as it reached a certain distance, a second one followed.  Same speed, color, and sound moving in the same direction.   This continued 3 more times.  All the same.   We tried to video it, but it is hard to see.  When we are able to slow the video down and zoom in, you can see the sphere changing colors.;41.3283999999995;-81.4980999999991
