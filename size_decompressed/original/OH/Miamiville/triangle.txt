It was triangular in shape with an orange glowing light at each corner, and avery small flashing light possibly green in color near one corner.  Very large in size.  Maybe about 200 feet wide.  Was very quiet compared to normal planes.  Flying about 300 feet altitude.   Hover in slow at first.  Then it started rising to higher altitude and pickingup speed very fast.  Then it disappeared behind the clouds.  Afterwards, I was planes pass over to see how long I could see them, and they were visible for awhile unlike the triangular object.   The first time I seen this was in the same place while standing in my yard with a friend.  Was in October 2016, 2 am.  Appeared and disappeared in the same way.  The first time we heard coyotes, and my dog was acting very on guard.  Pacing back and forth along the perimeter of the yard.  Then everything got quiet and the wind picked up a little and I noticed a cloud was illuminated with light.  That's was I notice the triangle shaped object flying toward our direction.   I've told neighbors about this and apparently one of them has picture and footage of the same thing from a drone.  I can contact him about getting a copy of the footage and pics he has.;39.2092;-84.3035
