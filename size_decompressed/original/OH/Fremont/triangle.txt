The light blinked back out but i could see that the craft was still just sitting there.I don't want to look crazy.but i can't sleep tonight and i swear that while i was just lying in my bed some thing made me turn and look out the window and i saw a face looking in at me,but it was not a human face,it was pressed right up to the glass and it was a grey-ish color with great big eyes. I thought that i was just seeing th! ings because i looked away not wanting to see it but when i looked back it was gone.I AM NOT A HOAX AND PLEASE DO NOT THINK THAT I AM CRAZY BUT I HAD TO TELL SOME BODY ABOUT THIS. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER STRANGE THINGS GOING ON IN FREMONT,OHIO SO THAT I DON'T THINK THAT I AM GOING NUTS.;41.3499;-83.1131
