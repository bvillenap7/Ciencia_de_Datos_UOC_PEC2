Ameoba-like UFO.;2015-04-26 21:30:00;5 minutes;Ameoba like UFO Was driving home and admiring the sky because it was clear and I could see alot of stars.  I observed what I initially thought was a bright star, but it was so bright that I thought maybe it was the moon.  So, I scanned the sky and the moon itself was obvious.  So I took my gaze back to the anomaly and first it looked like a bright sphere, and then it seemed to wiggle into two but closely held.   It continued to seem to wiggle, so I took my cellphone and captured the object.  When I got home, I cropped my photos and saw the strangest thing ever.  It looked like a cross between a cylinder and an ameoba.  I dont know what to make of it.;41.3499;-83.1131
