Boomerang shaped object 100-200ft in size at 250 to 300ft altitude with a speed of 25 to 40 mph directly overhead.;2003-12-20 19:16:00;2 min;Boomerang shaped object 100-200ft in size at 250 to 300ft altitude with a speed of 25 to 40 mph directly overhead. Date 12-20-03 Time 1916 Sky---Mostly clear Direction-NW to SE (heading about 120 degrees) Speed-Approx. 25-40 mph Altitude-250 to 300 ft. Shape-Boomerang Size-100 to 200 ft.(visible edge)  Upon going outside to check the night sky to see what star configurations could be viewed, something caught my eye. It was a off white colored boomerang shaped object passing slowly, directly overhead at about 200 to 300 feet. The color seemed more of a emission of light rather than the color of the object. It was having an effect on the air in front of it as it moved, creating a wake which was visible. Directly behind it was either high heat emissions or it had the capability to mask itself as being transparent, (which is how it seemed to me), because the sky behind it was translucent, except for the leading edge, (thus the boomerang shape).  There was no change in the air around me as far as static charge and no sound. The object continued on ESE at the same rate of speed until I could no longer view it. It was as if it was a hologram barley materializing in the air.;41.434399999999;-81.6373000000011

To deliver a load to a steel mill. I left my yard about an hour earlier in Lorain county. Traveling east on I-480, around Garfield HTS., Bedford, I noticed a light in the distance slowly approaching.  Since I grew up under a flight path of Hopkins airport, I thought it was a plane.  As it got closer, I noticed it had no red or green marker lights, no strobe lights.  Closer yet, it had panels of lights, on the ends, 4 units wide to five units high.  They went back along the body about 6 units, there were 3 of the sets of panels arranged like a 3 sided boomerang, the light was a broken up white like coming through cheap plastic bathroom glass.  Underneath, one dimmer, solidly lit red light in the center of the craft. It was moving slowly west, by south west,  I'm guessing a half mile away.  If I had a camera, the best UFO picture ever.;41.434399999999;-81.6373000000011
