Bright white and blue (basketball shaped).;2014-09-20 21:00:00;3 seconds;Bright white and blue (basketball shaped). Me and my sister were sitting in the backyard talking and a bright white and blue light appeared in the sky.  The blue was in the middle of the ball MIXED with white.  It zoomed past us in the sky and (like a basketball) it dunked into the clouds and disappeared.  We were so freaked out last night.;41.434399999999;-81.6373000000011
