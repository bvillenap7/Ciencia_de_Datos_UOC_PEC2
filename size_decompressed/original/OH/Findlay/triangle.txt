Two triangle parallel objects in the eastern sky in Northwestern Ohio;2005-09-03 19:23:00;9 seconds;Two triangle parallel objects in the eastern sky in Northwestern Ohio In the eastern sky I noted two triangle shaped objects.  A better discription is a lid to a pot or pan, except more triangled shaped.  The top had a black or dark knob or square shaped area the rest of the object was opaque light but not shiny. The black or dark area were at the top of the triangle the lower part the light/opaque part. The two objects were moving north to south  in a north to south parallel formation to each other at a fairly close distance to each other.  I followed them for appx. 8 seconds then their direction changed and both went in unison to the east until I could no longer see them in appx. 1-2 seconds.  The sky was clear blue with no clouds and the sun had not yet set.;41.0413025485441;-83.6461535194169
