Orange white object over northwest ohio.;2009-03-15 17:30:00;3 Min. ?;Orange white object over northwest ohio. My son and I were playing catch in the front yard. We heard a jet passing through quietly from the East heading West.  As I looked up I glanced to the North and another passenger jet was on a South East heading when I noticed a white light rushing toward the airliner.  It was about half the size of the plane and it swirled around close to the jet and then shot back to the west.  While moving it had an orangish white color and then it flashed reflecting the sun for second or two very brightly. The object then wobbled back and forth two times and shot off in a northern direction very fast appearing to be all white at that piont.  The sky was very clear and only a few clouds were present.  I have seen video of these craft before on tv and I can say the flight charactoristics were very similar.   At first it seemed like it was playing a game with the passenger jet.  I thought It might have been a bird but I have concluded that it was something very diferent.  Birds don't reflect the sun the way this thing did and they don't look orange in color either.  I don't know what it was but I know it was no airplain!;41.0413025485441;-83.6461535194169
