Strange Jet;2003-10-30 21:00:00;15 minutes;Strange Jet I am doing this after the sighting. I was wondering if I should or not. The sighting took place in Findlay Ohio on Oct. 30 2003. Me and my girlfriend live in Perrysburg. We use to live in Findlay but moved recently. Well we went to my mom and dads place for trick or treat. After trick or treat was over. Dad and a neighbor of thiers were sitting on the deck in front of the house. Me, mom, and my girlfriend were in the house. Dad called for us. When we got outside there was something strange in the sky. We saw it between 9:00-9:30pm. We caught see anything but lights. It was moving fast in a north to north east direction. We thought it was a jet at first but there was no engine sound. It was very low. But you couldn't hear any engines. We heard nothing not even a humming noise. It had a bright light at the front and at the back of it. It had a red flashing light in the middle of it. That was all we could see. I followed it from the front of the house to the back yard. I went as far as I could. Dad has a fence up to keep out unwanted people and animals. I lost it as it went behind some trees. As me and my girlfriend headed back home. I was looking for it as we went up the highway. But it was gone. We don't know the exact shape. All we know it was strange and it moved and turned fast. An airplane or a jet couldn't turn this fast or move as fast as this did. I was we got to see it with more light. So we could see the shape. Still til this day. I wish I could see it again.;41.0413025485441;-83.6461535194169
