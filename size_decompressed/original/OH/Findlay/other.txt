Large bright light in southwest sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD));2005-11-20 19:00:00;Approx. 1 hour;Large bright light in southwest sky. I can't say it was a spacecraft.  It is definetley a UFO because it occured int the Southwest sky and was the brightest light I have ever seen in the sky, even brighter than mars.  It did not move at first.  When we looked back at the object after a few minutes it was gone, then it reappeared again, this time moving northeast.  AS it moved northeast it slowly moved down.  IT made the most movement in the last 15 minutes prior to it's dissappearing.  It did not seem to change color, but I have never seen a star move like that and it certainly wasn't an aircraft.  There were planes flying in the sky at the time around the origination of the object.  The object seemed very far away much like it is a star in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and based on her description of the object, we suspect that she was looking at Venus.  PD));41.0413025485441;-83.6461535194169
