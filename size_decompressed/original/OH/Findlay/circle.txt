They were moving from a North to South direction over the city of Findlay Ohio.  They were moving very smoothly and slowly and silently never breaking formation.   Then all 6 just stopped over the city near the Marathon Airport for about one minute and again never breaking their formation.  After a minute or so they began moving slowly in a southerly direction still in formation and disappeared.  At first I thought they were helicopters but I have never seen any aircraft move in such a smooth manner with the ability to stop and move in perfect formation.;41.0413025485441;-83.6461535194169
