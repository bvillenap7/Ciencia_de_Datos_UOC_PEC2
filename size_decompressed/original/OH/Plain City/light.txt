Dash accross the Sky;1999-06-11 04:00:00;10 Seconds;Dash accross the Sky Around 04:00 hours, I went outside to smoke a cigarrette. At my Home. I saw a Lime green light object cross the sky in an extremely high velocity. As it moved from north to south it appeared as a dash accross the sky,lighting every couple of miles . It traveled an approximate distance of 150 miles in the sky at an elevation of around 20,000 feet. It crossed this expanse of sky in less than 1 second. From this point of A to B, it then did an 90 degree turn and traveled from east to west where it traveled in this dash pattern for approximately 50 miles in the sky in a split second where it simply vanished.;40.0968999999999;-83.2612000000002
