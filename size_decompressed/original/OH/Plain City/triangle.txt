We decided to bring a blanket out and lay down to look at the stars.  My boyfriend was dozing off but I was still looking at the sky when out of nowhere I see a pretty big orange, transparent triangular shaped object fly by right above me.  I sat up and yelled &quotoh my god! what is that?&quot  My boyfriend grabbed the binoculars and tried to look at it, but it was going so fast that by time I saw it and he reached over to grab them it was gone.  There was no noise at all, no wind, and it was about 1am.  We were very intrigued by this and really want to know what it was.  I've never seen anything like that before but it was really cool.  Also, we live near a lot of farms, so its very open area.  Another detail I left out, sorry, was that it looked like it was glowing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
