Beautiful early evening traveling in car with wife one mile from Dunkirk.  Hovering just off road is shiny saucer shaped craft approximately 100 feet in air and maybe 25 feet in diameter.   I stopped car and asked wife if she sees what I see as she does.  I shut off car and get out.I don't here sound from saucer but a small wisp of vapor is coming from it.  Attaced to the under surface of the saucer was a cup shaped structure which had window like spaces around the circumference.  On the undersurface of the cup was three lights(revolving I think)and possibly red, yellow and green?  I got back in car, as saucer slowly started to soundlessly rise and followed saucer to Dunkirk at which time the saucer had achieved a high altitude and poof just disappeared.saw no beings in the windows?  Of the craft ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.7859;-83.6364
