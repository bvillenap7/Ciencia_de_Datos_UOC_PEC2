I was walking down the Rd,and looked up and saw an oblong cylinder like object that was moving at a fast speed.  The object made no noise or any sounds at all,unlike conventional aircraft or jets or a helicopter.   What really made me decide it was a ufo was that it glowed a bright white.  I walked down the road staring at it until it was out of site, then I turned around and walked back approximatly an eighth of a mile and saw it again in the other direction for about one minute,then the craft was gone over the horizen.   The second time I saw the craft a prop engine plane flew by in the other direction,making clear in my mind that the object in question was nothing I had ever saw,so therefore I was prompted to file this report.;39.219;-84.1184999999999
