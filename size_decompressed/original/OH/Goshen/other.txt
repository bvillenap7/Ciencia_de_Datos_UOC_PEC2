Object appeared star like, but bulkier with of/on colored lights, primarily red/some green, blue.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2015-05-06 22:30:00;30 minutes+;Object appeared star like but bulkier with of/on colored lights, primarily red/ some green, blue Husband looks at stars off back deck of our house while smoking approx. 10:30.  Saw object we had seen a previous year.  It was like looking at a star, but bulkier, and on and off lights.  It constantly moved very fast:  up, down, crossways, very fast, but always in same general area, and mostly straight lines.  A bare tree in our vision line gave us way of judging scaled distance it would move.   We've seen it twice this week, and once a couple years ago.  We aren't looking for unusual objects, just hard not to see it.  We see it with our eyes, no special equipment, as if viewing stars, etc.  My husband did use his binoculars once and could see the lights more vivid.  My poor description would simply be a star with bulky shape and lights and constantly shooting in all directions, very rarely disappearing from sight.  Watched approx. 1/2 hr, but was still very active. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star, or a planet.  PD));39.219;-84.1184999999999
