Dark object flying around sky.;2001-12-01 22:30:00;30 minutes;Dark object flying around sky. I was sitting in my bedroom watching tv when I noticed a flash from outside my window. I got up to check it and I could see nothing for about 2 minutes. I saw another flash to the east. It took me a while to notice that the stars there were disappearing in order like something was flying over them. The thing looked about as big as a private jet. I got my sister and she agreed that it was not a normal aircraft. I watched the thing for about a half hour, and it flashed about every 2 to 5 minutes. It flashed at about 11:10 and then seemed to fly straight up into the sky. It disappeared.   The whole event seemed to occur about a half mile south of my apartment.  I sent an image that I captured with my digital camera. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness is describing the re-entry event that occurred at approximately 2120 hrs.
