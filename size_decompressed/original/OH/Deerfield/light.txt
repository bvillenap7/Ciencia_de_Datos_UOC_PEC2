Light going N to S in Ohio, angles then disappears from sight.;2002-06-16 00:25:00;1 minute;Light going N to S in Ohio, angles then disappears from sight. At 12:20 am EST in deerfield OH,I was looking up when I saw what appeared to be an unusually bright satellite going over, we see them all the time where we camp and the sky is clear. It was brighter than the space station usually is, we were watching it on a totally clear night,stars were visible in all directions. The light got directly overhead,moving north to south and as it kept its straight path, it moved slightly southwest and then disappeared, this all occured in about 30 seconds to 1 minute, it appeared heading south, then just disappeared, after 15 years of astronomy and satellite watching, I have never seen anything like it.
