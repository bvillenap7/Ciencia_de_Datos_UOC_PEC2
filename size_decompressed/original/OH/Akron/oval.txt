Ive never witnessed any thing like this and i was on an air craft carrier for three years and have not seen any of our planes do that.We were all faceing to the north off of route 8 north. There were three men and one woman that seen it.Two of us work in the construction business, one in a factory, and the other does billing for a company.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
Green Fireball  SOUND;2010-04-14 23:00:00;1 minute;Green Fireball SOUND April 14 the United States witness on media television a green fireball that passed through several states.  Many scientists, astronomers, government officials and government agencies have labeled it as a meteorite.   I donâ€™t believe it was as I believe that if something were to be seen by many as evidence, many still would not believe as the expression goes, even if it were to bite them on their rear ends. There is a video taken from the police dashboard of the sighting.  The strange thing that I wanted to report was that during the viewing of the dash board video there is silence as it was a quiet street that the officer was parked.  However, if you turn your theater home speakers up and turn up the bass something strange happens.  You  hear this heavy strong engine bursting sound going off and on as if something is cruising through space.   As the night turns to day you see the green round fire ball appear and then the sound goes quiet until you hear an explosion and the object darts off into the horizon with no trails.  The strange part is that upon turning the sound up the volume gets caught or stuck and if you pause the film you will continue to hear it unless you close the file and re-open.   Final note is that as the object darts of or at the end of the footage you will hear the police radio pick up something.    I believe it will be in the best interest of sound technicians to analyze this film footage.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085

Was leaving a business in Northfield, Ohio, when I noticed 2 oval objects in the sky that weren't moving.  White light on left of craft longer green line type of light longer than the white light - and a red light on the right side of craft. The objects were southwest of where I was positioned.  I drove home to Akron (Ohio) and the craft were still visible from my home - still in the southwest sky, but appeared somewhat closer than when I observed them in Northfield, Ohio.

However, these were the shiniest birds, no wings, they were glimmering in the sunlight. Hhowever these were metallic football shaped, and the shiniest things in the sky they kept shimmering and reflecting sunlight as I noticed they were moving in tight alignment.  As they moved out of the plane of my view they aligned into like a three object triangle and as the object starting getting more distant, and at a certain point it didn't stop, it seemed hesitate and then it shot straight up and into the sky of what little left I could see it was just like a really fast blur.  It was moving in a south east direction.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
