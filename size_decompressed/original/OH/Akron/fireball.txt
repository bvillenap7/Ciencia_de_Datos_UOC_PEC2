Clear sky, n;1998-11-11 19:45:00;90 seconds;Looking at sky before entering work building. Observed orange fireball. Object was observed while standing in parking lot. Clear sky, no clouds. Observed, one orange fireball, with a white outer glow, travelling East to West over Akron.  Accompanying this round fireball, was a long white tail that was emitting sparks, like a fourth of July sparkler, and dropping dark unknown debris.  It was observed to be at a very low altitude.  I observed this object for approximately one and one half minutes, before it just disappeared before my eyes.  It left no trace of it's presence behind.  I am quite sure of the date, as my son's birthday was to be the next day, November 12th.  I am also sure of the time as I am scheduled to work at 8:oo P.M.  I looked at my watch, just prior to spotting the object.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
Bright white to reddish orange in the sky looked like a shooting star, until it stopped in mid air.;2006-04-04 03:50:00;4 min;Bright white to reddish orange in the sky looked like a shooting star, until it stopped in mid air. While I was driving to work I noticed what appeared to be a shooting star. A stream of light was trailing behind as normal with shooting stars. I then noticed it stopped in midair and hovered for about two seconds, then the object took a sudden left turn and continued to hover statinary. Object eventually went out of sight. The colorazation was a white to red orange hugh. I have worked around airplanes for many years and have never seen any aircraft act like that. I hope Im not the only one who saw this very amazing! Also looked like it had a red beacon but did not blink. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
Flame in the sky.;2009-08-01 23:00:00;6 minutes;Flame in the sky. We were sitting on the back porch of a friends house in Akron, when out of no where we saw the object hovering in the sky.  I remarked jokingly I must be seeing things, but everyone else saw it, we watched it zoom around the sky for about 5-6 minutes.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
Bright fire in the sky, hovered and split off into four.;2011-11-13 18:30:00;About three minutes;Bright fire in the sky, hovered and split off into four. My husband and I were driving and I noticed what appeared to be a orange/reddish fire in the sky.   At first I thought it was a airplane on fire then I thought it was the top of a cell tower.  It got bigger then split off into four fireballs.  It appeared to hover then turn around.   We saw a red light then disappear on the distant horizon.  We put our windows down to see if we could hear anything like a helicopter, it was silent.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
Three fireball-like objects crossed the sky from east to west in succession.;2012-03-21 22:00:00;10 minutes;Three fireball-like objects crossed the sky from east to west in succession. We were sitting on the porch when we noticed a fireball-like object coming from the east. It took several minutes to pass by, then seemed to ascend, and then faded out.  Then, it faded back on, and out again.  It was about a minute later when another fireball came out of the south-east, and faded out again in the west.  I woke my neighbor up to see the last bit of the second fireball, and it wasn't long until we saw a third once again coming from the south-east. It took a few minutes to pass, and then faded out.  All three UFO's seemed to change speed, but were moving very slowly.  They were all orange in appearance and seemed to flicker.  They made no sound and had no tail whatsoever.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
Some something that was not explainable.;2012-06-09 23:00:00;15 minutes;Some something that was not explainable. 11pm or so we were driving home from Canton on 77 North.  When we crossed to Route 8 we saw some odd bright orange lights in the sky.  Almost directly over head.  After the first 5 or so that we noticed we decided to pull over so we did not get into an accident.  We stopped on Perkins street to get out and watch the &quotshow&quot.  the came in groups of 5-10.  all going the same direction at the same speed.   We were under them at this point.  We would think it was over but then another wave would go over head. My husband and I thought maybe wedding balloons luminaries but no lights were flickering and they were not floating.  these lights were steady moving pretty fast...  not meandering like a balloon in the wind---there was not any wind that night.  We could see other people &quotrubbernecking&quot, 1 other guy stopped and we all watcehd together.  it was really amazing and scary at the same time.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
Fire ball, then triangle of 3, then several covering sky and spreading as they headed W or WNW.;2012-06-09 23:09:00;2-5 minutes;Fire ball, then triangle of 3, then several covering sky and spreading as they headed W or WNW. Heading north bound on RT8 between the interchange and Perkins exit, I noticed what I first thought to be a news chopper or LifeFlight landing or flying in the western sky.  This gives you an idea of how bright and close this was as I was only a mile at the most from the hospital.   When I looked again, I noticed that it was glowing orange and yellow kind of like a large fire ball, I was actually amazed when I saw this as an option, as this is how I've been describing it.   I looked again and noticed that there were now 3 in a triangle formation, seemingly hovering.  I grabbed my phone and my friend did the same, as we looked up again, they're were now 8, 9,10 a growing number, reaching somewhere between 10 and 20 and no longer seemed to be in formation, but spreading out as they headed west and went out of sight.   I was wondering if this could have been a meteor shower? i don't know what else could explain this??;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
Bright, slow moving, orange lighted orb traveling through sky then vanishes.;2013-03-02 19:07:00;6 minutes;Bright, slow moving, orange lighted orb traveling through sky then vanishes It was a very large glowing orange light comparable to a glowing orange orb.  It moved rather slowly.  I would say I seen it travel possibly 4 to 5 miles then it just vanished..  Clear one second then gone.  It didn't seem that high in the sky either.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
