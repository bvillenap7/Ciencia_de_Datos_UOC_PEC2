Bright green flash lights the whole night sky, south of Cleveland;2005-04-02 22:30:00;3-5 seconds;Bright green flash lights the whole night sky, south of Cleveland A group of 4 of my friends and I were leaving a concert in Cleveland, driving south  in a horrible snow storm in April 2nd, 2005.   While we were still in the Cleveland area around 9:10 p.m. when we saw a quick green flash in the sky,like bright green lightning, we assumed it was a light from the airport nearby and didn't think too much of it.  As we were continuing home, around 10:30 p.m., north of Akron on the highway with fields all around us, there was another flash, but this one was much brighter, like we were closer to what had happened before. The bright flash of green light lit up the whole sky like a green sun.  My one friend and I both had our eyes closed in the back-seat when we were both startled by a bright green flash that shined through our eyelids like a flashlight. When we opened our eyes we saw the green sky and we both saw a white floating ball (light?) cross the road several hundred feet in front our car.   The other 3 passengers (including the driver) saw the bright green light. The light lit up the inside of the car so much that the driver couldn't even see his dash lights. The passengers that had their eyes open the entire time didn't see the white object moving across the road because they were all temperally moon-blinded from it going from the bright green to the black sky.  The whole event only lasted 3-5 seconds, and afterward several of us had felt our hair standing on end for a couple minutes afterward. We didn't see any more flashes during the rest of the drive.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
