PD));2014-09-02 21:02:00;7-12 seconds;Bright light, very high, took only 7-10 seconds, horizon to horizon, no sound no contrail 09/02/2014   UFO sighting?  or strange aircraft   Saw a bright light at high altitude moving north west, about heading 350-355 degrees. The object was very high, and at first I thought it was a satellite.  When the object appeared at 80 degrees to my viewing angle, I'm 5'11 1/2, facing about 5-7 degrees compass heading.     As soon as I saw the bright light, it went out that confusing me for a satellite.  I noticed what appeared to be possibly a very faint small green light and very small faint red light very close together, perpendicular to a line heading in the direction of 350-355 degrees.  Very faint, very close together.   The strange thing was, NO sound,  No contrail, and the light I saw appeared twice as large as the object, as referenced  to the closeness of the red and green lights.   It moved SE to NW across the sky in about 7 seconds before I could no longer see any light of the object.  Sky clear, unlimited visibility.  Just saying.   Ex-USAF(Capt-Navigator), Ex USAR(major) logistics, armour, and Operations Analyst, age 64.  This is only the second time in my life that I have seen something I could NOT identify.
