Cigar Shaped Object, vertically aligned, seen in area of Lockheed Martin.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-22 06:35:00;6 minutes;Cigar Shaped Object, vertically aligned, seen in area of Lockheed Martin This morning, my husband & I were sitting with our coffee, looking east, from our porch.  My husband had briefly mentioned seeing a strange shaped light in the sky on 04.20.19, at approximately 5:30 pm and was describing the situation to me...   He was with a friend when they both saw a cigar shaped object (it was actually situated vertically, not in the horizontal position you would imagine) in the sky that hovered for a few minutes, made a sharp right turn and then disappeared.  He was telling me all if this when I saw a similar object in the sky.  It was the vertical cigar shaped light he saw.  It seemed to be glowing, but we realized it was reflecting the sun rise.  It stayed in the same spot, then slowly started to go down in altitude, then disappeared.   The object seemed to be hovering in the area close to the Goodyear Airdock/Lockheed Martin.
