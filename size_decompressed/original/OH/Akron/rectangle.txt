Red lights just on but and white lights flashing and it moved horizontally and vertically with ease;2015-06-09 22:15:00;3 minutes;Red lights just on but and white lights flashing and it moved horizontally and vertically with ease ok folks i was looking southwesterly at 2215 and there hovering about 3-5 miles away in the sky a few miles up in ther sky was this unidentified craft.  It appeared to have three red lights that glowed in a vertical shaft formation and long with these two white lights flashing off and on.   Now i would not of really paid it much attention untill I realized on this clear and quiet night I could not hear one engine!  Airplanes fly over the hiosue all the time and I can hear them from miles away long before seeing them.   Then the little feller decided to move laterally then vetically and hovered some more.  Then is justy took off i should say slowly went out of view.   I well versed in military, commercial, and private flying craft and this was not one of them.  Not even a drone could do what it was doing at that scale.   This was in Portage Lakes, Ohio. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Rectangular, almost square, a little smaller than the Goodyear blimp, no lights, gray color;2015-07-24 10:45:00;2 minutes;Rectangular, almost square, a little smaller than the Goodyear blimp, no lights, gray color Saw a rectangular (nearly square) object moving about the same speed as a blimp moves (maybe a little faster).  I first noticed it while I was driving on 77N (on my left, maybe a mile or less away) by the Copley exit, lost it in the tree line, but then saw it again heading on the same straight path.  Lost it again in the tree line (as the highway declines in elevation) before I exited on the Ridgewood/Miller exit.
