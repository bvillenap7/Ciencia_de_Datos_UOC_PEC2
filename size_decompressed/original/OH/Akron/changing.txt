As i focused in on the yellow light i could see what looked like two seprate lights, then i was able to see some kind of image, it was dark in color, when we viewed the tape it looked as though it was a large object, could not tell what the shape was, but we counted 3 other lights on this  object  the two lights look like they could be 2 windows with the bright light shining through.. i went outside to get more footage of this object, but the light turned into a ball, or round object, it looked like it had  wire wrapped around it, i could see the image i had seen earlier, i know this was the same object i taped a few minutes before, becuase it was in the same area, it just moved up higher in the sky.. we also viewed 6 triangle formations in differnt parts of the sky, ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses were looking at a star, but that is a guess.

Shape shifting worm like ufo;2009-09-09 21:00:00;30 to 40 minutes;Shape shifting worm like ufo This object flew into view behind my house in NE Ohio on Sept. 9 2009 while I was sitting out back at around 8:30 to 9 pm. From the ground with the naked eye I thought it was the lights of an airplane, but it stopped and stood still in one spot for at least a half hour. When I went back in the house after taking the photos, it was still hovering so I don't know exactly how long it was there. After about 10 minutes I grabbed my Fuij digital camera and took a series of 8 photos a few seconds apart. I could not make out any shapes, only flickering lights, with the naked eye and the screen on the camera. It wasn't until I zoomed in on the object in photoshop that I could see the shapes of the object. The UFO was changing shapes as I took the photos. I would have taken more photos if I knew that this was what I would find when I zoomed in on it. I think that the colorization of the UFO is very similar to the those in some of the recent Kumburgaz UFO Videos. I hav! e the original unzoomed photos, they are about 1 mb each, taken at about 3 megapixel resolution. Unfortunately my camera was not set at full resolution or the photos would have been much better. You can view the zoomed photos at my website at http://freshnuts.wordpress.com/2009/09/13/shape-shifting-ufo/;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
the gray object flew by really fast.;2019-08-17 12:53:00;570mb;the gray object flew by really fast I have no idea who I should get ahold of to help out with my video.  On Aug. 17, 2019, at 12:53 pm my friend was outside my house and with his cell phone started taking a video of the sky about 00.07.51 seconds long.   He came into the house to look at his video and saw something in the video that he didn't see while filming it.  He caught something that flew by so fast it was gone in a blink of an eye.  When the counter gets at 0:0:1:08 you have to watch really close to see it pass by.  We also put the video on my laptop so we could see it in 360 degree and paused it you can see a bright hole in the sky where it comes from.  We have shown a few people the video and there is no one who can explain it and I have no idea what it could be.  I think you would really be interested in viewing my video and helping to figure out what it is.  Would really appreciate any feedback or help in any way.  I know he caught something that we can't explain.  It seemed like a smoky object that changed its shape and it was see through.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
