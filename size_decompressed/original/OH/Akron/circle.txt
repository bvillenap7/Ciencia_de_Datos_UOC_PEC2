Giant Silver Ball Hanging Over Akron In the Late 1960's;1969-07-30 13:00:00;3 hours;Giant Silver Ball Hanging Over Akron In the Late 1960's In 1969 or 1970 when I was a little girl I saw a UFO. I lived on the North Hill in Akron, Ohio. One summer night, I believe late in the summer there was a giant silver ball in the sky that just hung in the sky for about 3-4 hours in the middle of the day. It was hanging in the western sky. The whole neighborhood saw it, in fact I think they may have even talked about it on the news. There was a Goodyear Blimp Hangar in Akron so the first thing everyone thought was that it could have been a new weird shaped Blimp, but they said it wasn’t the blimp. It was just a great big silver ball and it didn’t move. The adults in the neighborhood did not seem to be afraid of it, so I wasn’t scared but I have always wondered what that dang thing was.

Somewhere around 10:00-10:30 p.m. on 8/27/03, my friend and I went outside on the deck of our house to see Mars since that was the best night to see it (it was supposed to be the brightest it had been in 60,000 years).  While trying to find Mars, we both noticed 2 very bright stars (we didn't mention them to each other, but kept trying to locate Mars).  We located Mars, and then one of us mentioned the 2 bright stars we had seen.  We both found the 2 bright stars again and looked at them for a few seconds (had to look straight up with our necks craned) and then they both started moving.  They went up into the sky (you could tell they were going up - not just fading) and, then instead of going up (vertically), they started going sideways (horizontally) in the same direction (toward the south, I think) and then just disappeared after about 15-20 seconds.  They both moved while keeping the same distance apart the whole time.  We stayed outside for a few minutes afterwards, but didn't see anything else move, so we came inside.  These 2 objects looked just like big, bright stars.  They were too high to be airplanes, they made no sounds, and they nothing was flashing.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085

While on break at work I noticed a light in the sky.  At first glance I thought it might be a spotlight, but quickly noticed it was above the dense clouds, I then noticed that as it made a constant circle it was also rotating.  I had two Co workers and a customer check it out with me, none of us could come up with what it could be.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085

We watched as it continued east and took a picture almost immediately after his flash on his camera went off, all the lights on the object turned off but we could still see the object and it turned and went west.  The object seemed to float slowly across the sky until we could no longer see it.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
