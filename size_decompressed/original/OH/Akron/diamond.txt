Moving Star  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD));2008-08-04 00:00:00;all night;Moving Star This thing I thought was a star is not it moves left to right and gains light intensity then goes dark. I went in my car and it seemed to follow. I am not drunk, crazy or high this thing is still there seen it now 2 nights and have been in this spot for 11 years and on my computer. So, I know it is not a star cause it moves and it is pretty low like maybe 30k feet up. Just and FYI..;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
