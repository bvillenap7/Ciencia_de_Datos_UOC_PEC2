Aerial light makes turns not possible for aircraft.;1969-06-01 22:00:00;10 seconds;Aerial light makes turns not possible for aircraft. While walking home from a friends house in suburban Akron, I saw what appeared to be an aircraft light in the sky heading west.  It was a single point of light with no distinguishable features. What made the event notable is that it made a sharp 90 degree turn to the south and then a second or two later another 90 degree turn to the east.   There was no slowdown or gradual turn, it was an immediate and sharp change in direction unlike any aircraft I'd ever seen.

1 light split into 3,hovered, then flew away;1988-04-04 23:30:00;30 seconds;1 light split into 3,hovered, then flew away Saw a bright light remaining still above the horizon while I was looking out my bedroom window.  It caught my attention because it was larger and brighter than a normal airplane light.  I figured the plane was flying with its landing gear on.  Then the one light became 3 distinct lights.  One flew away to the left and at the same time one flew away to the right.  Seconds after that the center light flew over our house.  My bedroom window looks over the Cuyahoga Valley towards Cuyahoga Falls.  Not sure what the heck it was, but it was anything I'd ever seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

No sound, not blinking. Was as bright as a space station, but moved slower than a space station. Then the color of the light of the object began to change from yellowish-white to orange, then red, than dark red, then disappeared as if the light was turned off (or in went to another dimension?);41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085

I was the only person walking on the commons area at the time 5:05p.m. Bright day with some white clouds. Just by chance looking at the bright sky, almost directly overhead , saw six bright seemingly transparent lights very high moving slowly toward the west in a slow manner. As I was walking almost straight up I recounted objects but now tere were five--for sure there were six before--they were in a loose formation ---not very close to each other. As yet, this day heard of no media reports of these.        Six almost transparent bright objects moving due west.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
Strange Lights Seen in Ohio Hang Above for Two Nights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of stars, we suspect??  PD));2011-11-01 02:45:00;30 minutes;Strange Lights Seen in Ohio Hang Above for Two Nights The first strange light was viewed in the 308 degree North West from 40 degree 55'58 N, 81 degrees 27'55 W. It appeared to move not only up and down but also in a circular pattern twice over the 30 minute period. It mainly quivered from its original spot in between two nearby stars, which, to the other witness and I, provided a point of reference to verify that it was in fact moving. It appeared to have a halo of incredible darkness around it that sometimes restricted how much light we could see from our viewpoint.  It also appeared to be spinning on an axis at a perfect 90 degree angle, which revealed pillars of light (for lack of a better descriptor) that emanated outward every 45 degrees around the edges of the base sphere of light that seemed to be constant. The second strange light was seen in nearly the exact opposite direction of the previous light, but it was lower in the sky and seemed closer to us.  This light appeared very much like the first one but was much more active.  It moved in a pattern that resembled the symbol for infinity for a few seconds, then would slowly creep back towards its original position, then move again, slightly yet definitively and quickly.  This second light even made a zig-zag pattern to the left and right of its original position relative to the nearby stars.  It too even showed a pinhole-effect (restriction of light) which seemed to be caused by a ring of darkness around it. Both of the lights also had a constant flickering effect to them that seemed like it was inconsistent, and may have been a result of the light's spinning, as when the pinhole effect would take place the light became much smaller and perfectly spherical.  These were the two brightest things in the sky besides Jupiter at this point of the night, and your eye was drawn to it.  They moved fluidly and unlike anything I've ever seen, almost as if someone had an incredibly powerful laser pointer and was trying to hold it steady, but the light came down on us and not from the ground up. Like I said we were all very far away from it, and when we saw planes fly near them from our point of view they seemed to be possibly as far as in orbit around our planet, and possibly as close as 50,000 feet up. Both of the lights were viewed extensively and this was the second night in a row I have seen them both in very similar positions in the sky if not the same position.  I downloaded an app on my phone that shows all of the stars in the known universe by pointing at them in the sky and both of these objects did not register with the app as anything known to us in the sky.  This includes planets, constellations, galaxies, and even satellites (there are even Russian craft). I have also been recruiting more witnesses since yesterday and tonight three more of my friends verified that they too were seeing the same event of these incredibly strange lights.

Multiple Reddish lights over north Akron.;2014-07-04 22:50:00;5 minutes;Multiple Reddish lights over north Akron. Upon returning from fireworks and pulling into our driveway, my wife noticed multiple reddish  lights moving east then changing directions moving south east of downtown akron.   In total we witnessed 6 lights that at one point appeared only maybe a 1/4 mile away and producing no sound at all.   We watched them for over 5 minutes before they blinked out.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
20-30 multicolored fast moving orbs seen over Akron, Ohio.;2016-02-06 21:30:00;~90 minutes;20-30 multicolored fast moving orbs seen over Akron, Ohio. At approx. 21:30 eastern time, I was watching TV.  The TV room in my house faces to the west.  All of a sudden, I started seeing very bright multicolored lights, at first just one at a time, moving from west to northeast quickly.  I mentioned to my wife if she had noticed this?  Her comment was it may just be a reflection off our gutter from passing cars down the street. As the time passed, I kept seeing more and more of these bright, fast moving, multicolored orbs following the same flight path and quickly ran outside for a closer look.  Once I got outside, I noticed a steady stream of the orbs, sometimes in groupings of four or five at a time, moving across the sky.  Now our weather here in Akron, while cold, was perfect.  Crystal clear skies last when I observed this amazing event.  Another thing I noticed while i was on the phone with the police was a passing commercial airliner, which was moving in a northwesterly direction over me. I could see and hear the marker lights as well as the engine.  I also clearly heard the passing traffic, I live a block away from a main street here in Akron. As the orbs passed, they were completely silent! and I noticed they were relatively low in the sky.  As they traveled through the sky at times they seemed not to far from the top of near by buildings.  The last orbs trailed off around 22:15;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
Green UFO making directional changes;2020-02-17 05:25:00;3 minutes;Green UFO making directional changes I work for a food distributor in Akron Ohio. When I got to my first stop around 6:25AM I got out of my truck and looked out towards the horizon. I noticed a light green light in the sky moving strangely, I observed for about 10 seconds and pulled out my iPhone to record the event. The object was making very sharp maneuvers and flashing bright then getting dim again. This object flew at a rapid speed and changed direction like I have never seen any aircraft do before. After about two and a half minutes of recording it disappeared. You can not see the green color in my video but it reminded me of the color of mint ice cream. Like white mixed with green. There are parts of the video where it is hard to see the craft but if you can zoom in you can follow it for almost the entire video. For a moment it disappears behind a satellite dish but will reappear going the opposite direction shortly.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
Have never seen anything Move this fast or change directions this rapidly.;2020-02-17 05:25:00;3 minutes+;I work for Gordon Food Service and was delivering to Parasson's Italian Restaurant on Waterloo Rd. In Akron Ohio. When I got out of my truck I noticed the light moving strangely, so after about 10 seconds I decided to pull out my phone and record. Light seemed to have a greenish hue. I recorded about 3 minutes of video and it disappeared. I have never seen anything Move this fast or change directions this rapidly. Too far away and too fast to be a drone in my opinion but I guess I could be wrong.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
