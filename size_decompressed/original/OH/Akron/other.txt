On the opposite side of the sky from the fireworks we seen multiple shooting stars.  The odd thing is that the shooting stars were changing colors as the hit the atmosphere.  Blue, red, purple, etc.  Then that's when I seen the spacecraft.  I knew right away because how fast it was and how bright it was..  It was bright like the sun, but not blinding.  It looked like a cartoon.  It was yellow like the sponge Bob square pants cartoon.  That's how I knew it was out of this world.   Also, it wasn't oval, disk, saucer, cigar..  Nothing of the norm I hear about UFO..  It was a spider shaped craft.. It had legs like a spider.  The spider feature was phenomenal to me.   Me and my friend looked at each other and confirmed we seen a cartoon spider flying across the sky.  I will never forget.  It is as good as it gets for a belief that something is out there that isn't human;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
sightings in akron ohio multi colored and shaped object;2004-06-27 06:30:00;2 hours;sightings in akron ohio multi colored and shaped object My friend was awakened by an extremely bright light shining in her bedroom she looked out the window and saw this object in the sky various colors red, green,orange.  It was staying in the same spot hovering when it did move it went very fast horizontally and vertical.  Also the shape would change from saucer to round to triangle at one point it looked like a circle with holes in it almost like a smile face.  It just was very odd almost like a lazer light show.  She did get it on video and called a couple freinds to see it too, I saw the tape and I cant explain it. A few days later alot of people have seen simalar things it was on the news, and the police dept took pics, the only explaination was a military manufacturer was testing a new aircraft around that time period so that could be it some sort of new top secret thing whatever it was it was nothing we have ever seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have been looking at a celestial body, perhaps a twinkling star.  PD));41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
