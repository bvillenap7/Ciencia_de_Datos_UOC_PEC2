round orbs in the middle of the day;2001-07-25 14:30:00;3-4 mins;round orbs in the middle of the day Was walking back into my building from taking trash out and was standing in the middle of a large empty parking lot and stopped for a min. to stretch my leggs and enjoy the warm summer afternoon.  As i stood there looking straight up in the sky something strange caught my eye.  Thru the slight haze, a small whiteish looking object of some kind caught my eye.  At first i thought it might be some kind of gull that one often sees around a land fills.  as i strained to identify the object i noticed several more, flying in circles around the first.  The more intensely i stared, the more orbs i noticed.  The harder i tryed to identify what they were the more i counted.  the origional one flew in a straight line with the others circleing around the first.  It almost appeared as though they wereplaying. i looked away on several occasions and looked back to see if i was just imagining this and i was able to located the group of orbs each time.  to my utter amazement I continued to watch for several mins. until my neck began to ache from looking straight up.  I looked away a last time and was never able to locate them again.  I have no idea what they were.  I know the were not birds, ballons or planes.  They appeared to be round, dull (not shiney or reflective) metalic looking objects that were flying under the control of someone or something.  Due to the elevation and haze i cannot tell you how big or small they were.  The sighting last only a couple of mins. but the memory will last forever. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

sphere crosses night sky;2008-04-14 21:23:00;4 secs;sphere crosses night sky I was sitting on my back porch and I saw a circular object flash through the sky.  It was moving from East to West.  The object was slightly smaller in size than the moon appears in the sky. Not sure what it could have been but it gave me goose bumps and kind of freaked me out.  I have seen many shooting stars in my life and this wasn't one of them.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
Three metallic orbs scramble in the wake of a jet in the northern sky seen from Ohio.;2011-11-12 13:00:00;45 seconds;Three metallic orbs scramble in the wake of a jet in the northern sky seen from Ohio. After watching a jet pass by,I watched the contrails disappear.  I continued to watch the northern sky wondering how far away this jet was because it was so small and soundless.  A silver orb came along the same path as the jet abou a minute later.  It went straight fron west to east in the northern sky.  Then It went straight up winking in and out of sight.   Then it was joined by two other orbs,both silver coming from east to west. They remained close together and appeared to scramble.   I called my sister, she saw one orb. I went outside to get a better look.  They were gone.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
