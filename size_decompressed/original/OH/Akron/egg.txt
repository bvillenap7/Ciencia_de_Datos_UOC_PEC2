Gray blimp-like object seen in daytime sky and photographed.;2018-10-26 14:00:00;Several minutes;Gray blimp-like object seen in daytime sky and photographed. When witness first noticed the object, it was over I-77, south bound, slowly heading from E - W about a quarter mile from the exit.  While driving home from an eye appointment, object first seen it was not a plane, blimp or helicopter and observer felt a little anxiety / excited.  Thought it had disappeared until he/she got to next exit where it was behind the trees.  When observer stopped at light I was able to take four pictures using an iPhone 7plus.  From the freeway the object was approximately at 3 o’clock high.  When I saw the object from the exit ramp it was approximately at 2 o’clock high behind the trees.  There were no lights or sound, the color was dull gray.  Moving very slow and low.  When the light changed I turned left on to the I- 77 overpass then right on to Mull Ave.  As I passed where the trees and object were I could not see it anymore, it’s like it just disappeared.  I had a clear view once I passed the trees.  I should of been able to see it behind or over the trees.  There are no airfields in the area.  I checked the Goodyear blimp schedule for Oct 26th, there were no blimps flying that day.  Temp was 28 degrees, overcast light rain, wind slightly from the North West.
