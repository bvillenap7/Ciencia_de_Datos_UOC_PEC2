My son and I first saw this same craft just over a year ago and I saw it alone last night at approx 11pm. We first saw it in early 2010 outside Akron, Ohio driving south on rt 21.  It was actualling coming from my right (west) from Medina county...very slowly and did not realiza how huge it was till it was directly over my car.  I opened my sun roof and I think it was almost as big as a football field.  It was low and had lights on three corners like a triangle.  It was totally silent.  I pulled off on the side of the road to take a photo with my cell phone and it was gone.  last night i saw it again almost in the exact spot?????? Last night it was moving slow as well plus i had trees on both sides of me so couldnt see it for long.  Does the government even acknowledge these?   I didnt report it last time but this time feel compelled to...something is going on??? Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Original date is flawed.  We have corrected it.  PD));41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085

It made no noise and it was about 500 feet above my lot.   As I watched it come closer over head it turned (shaky tilts) it just disappered.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
Large, fast triangle craft;2013-07-25 09:50:00;5 minutes;large, fast triangle craft I was driving with my wife and we noticed a light in the distance kind of moving swiftly from left to right and then it stood still, and then when it moved back to the left we became extremely supicios.   As we drove closer we noticed it was a triangular shape with 3 lights, not 1.   It hoevered over and empty field to out left for what seemed like forever, but im sure it was just a few seconds. We slowed down to a crawl and watched in awe.  It then quickly zipped off at a speed that weve never seen.  It wasnt until after that we noticed there was no other cars around, on a pretty busy road. people may not believe me, but i know what i saw.it certainly wasnt anything of this world.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085

At first there is a loud voice that says something that sounds to my husband like, “brime me.”  To me, however, it sounds like “prove it.”  The recording continued for five minutes.  There were no additional sounds that could be made out, however there were two orbs that were seen moving quickly across the camera. They were triangular in shape. At one point, two started to fall near my car, merged into one, and then just disappeared.  Also during this time, areas of the video became shadowed and pixelated and appeared to take somewhat of a human form.  It looked like what I can only describe as some type of dark matter. We have a chain link fence.  We had a tarp hanging on one piece of the fence. The shadow moves behind the tarp and appears to press against it with its hands and face to try and make itself more visible to the camera.;41.0855835970022;-81.5319925895085
