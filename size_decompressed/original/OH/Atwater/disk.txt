Dull silver object moving south to north at rapid speed.;2014-04-19 13:15:00;8 seconds;Dull silver object moving south to north at rapid speed. I was driving from south to north on Atwater avenue when I noticed a dull silver disk/saucer like object traveling north in a straight line.  It was about the size of my wedding ring and rapidly got smaller as it traveled what seemed to be very fast, I have NEVER seen anything move this fast.   The sky was clear with no cloud coverage and the view I had was without a doubt a ufo.;41.0335;-81.1985
