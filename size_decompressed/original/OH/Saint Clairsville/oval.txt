Metallic white almond shaped object  with bright blue aura in dense woodland;2021-05-12 02:36:00;25 minutes;Metallic white almond shaped object  with bright blue aura in dense woodland I was on the back exterior of my home and noticed a blue, almost aqua colored light coming from this oval like object resting slightly above ground in the woodland behind my house. In attempt to walk back towards the aura I was met with an unusual sensation almost as if i could no longer inhale the air around me due to it being so dense. when approaching this object i noticed how the exterior of it was a bright white metallic like substance. On the sides of this i could make out large square orifices that seemed to have a reflective material over the top of them that produced this bright blue light. as I approached further the object seemed to lift off the ground with no contact from the brush or damage to any trees surrounding the area, it raised from its previous position and almost hovered in the opposite direction with no noticeable sound,  the lights on this craft began to flash and then shut off permanently.;40.0778;-80.9788
