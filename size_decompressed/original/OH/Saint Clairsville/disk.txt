On ei;2002-10-22 20:15:00;15 MINUTES;This object had what seemed to be headlights flashing different colors at the center ofwhat appeared to be a disk-shaped object.  On either side of the panel of colored ligghts, we saw a series of white lights.  It seemed that orange-gold beams shone from the left and right edges of the craft.  The craft hovered over the malls at exit 2180 on I-70.  The craft appeared to remain stationary for about 8-10 minutes, then began to rise and move in a south-west direction.  In a brief time, it had climbed so high and move so far to the southwest, we could no longer see it.;40.0778;-80.9788
