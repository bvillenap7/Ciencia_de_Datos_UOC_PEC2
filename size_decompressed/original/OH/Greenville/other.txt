I was walking my dog at 10:50 p.m. The sky was clear and I was watching out for shooting stars when I notice coming from the east ( if I were to point at them,  my arm would be at a 45 degree angle...NOTE the angles are given as if straight up is 0 degrees) two objects. These objects were crescent shaped with the horns toward the back. Both had a soft whitish glow to them, and both wavered or wrippled like reflections off of a pond .They crossed over me so that my head was at a 10 - 15 degree angle. The objects where silent and left no trails behind them, the top object was slightly ahead of the other. They would drift toward each other with the two inner crescent horns over lapping .They did this 3 to 4 times. The objects disappeared heading west. They faded from view at the same 45 degree angle as when they came into view. There was a jet ( I believe passenger) flying close by. To me the jet and objects appeared no more than 1 to 2 inches apart. The objects gave me the impression of being lower than the jet..though they did not pass between me and the jet. It was at this time that they faded from view. I am a 27 year old honor roll graduate of Greenville High School.  My hobbies include art, astronomy, biology, geology and many of the other sciences as well.;40.0992;-84.6297999999998
