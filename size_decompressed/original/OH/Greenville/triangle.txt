These three lights on this craft werethe same color and approximate size of the stars on this starry night.  My girlfriend and I have seen this same craft about a year prior slowly flying over nearby Covington, Ohio.  We are near Wright Patterson Air Force base in Dayton, Ohio.  My guess is this is prototype stealth spy drone ...very hard to detect, possibly flying low enough to be under radar.  My girlfriend on the other hand thinks itsfrom outer space...who knows...;40.0992;-84.6297999999998
