Greenville, OH.  At 1:11 pm November 28, 2012 I saw an orange flash of light shine through my upstairs heavy curtained window, and I hear a loud, quick boom.  It was quicker than the sound of thunder, but just as loud.  I did not see what made the noise and flash of light.  I did not lose power, and I could not see any smoke outside.  There were no sirens.  I called the police department at 1:28 pm, but no one else had reported anything at that point.  I see nothing on the internet about it.;40.0992;-84.6297999999998
