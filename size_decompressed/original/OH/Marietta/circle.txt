Circular space craft with large light in center and small surrounding circular lights seen hoovering near I-77;2009-09-13 00:30:00;1 minutes;Circular space craft with large light in center and small surrounding circular lights seen hoovering near I-77 On September 13, 2009 we were driving from North Carolina to Canton, OH. At approximately 12:30 am we witnessed a UFO on I-77 North near the Marietta exit. Prior to the sighting we were starring at the stars in amazement. The sky was absolutely clear you could see stars for miles. The moon was not out at this time. The driver said, “Hey what is that? Its huge.” Then the passenger in the rear was overwhelmed by the size and said, “That’s a UFO”. At that time, I stuck my head out the sunroof to witness this. The UFO was hovering above the tree line. It had a disk like shape and a large circular light in the center of the spacecraft and smaller circles lights surrounding the one in the center. We were all absolutely amazed and excited. We asked each other what we had seen and each description was the same.  We continued driving and as the road curved the moon appeared out of nowhere to our right. It was a crescent shape but it was so low to the ground. It could have been hiding behind the trees during our commute but it was strange how after the sighting it appeared out of nowhere.;39.4251;-81.4613
