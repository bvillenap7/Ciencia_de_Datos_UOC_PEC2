Me and my father was pumping the oil well and I was looking up in the sky at the stars and I said dad look at that light up in the sky , it is going really fast . It was a bright white /yellow light . It covered 1/2 the sky distance in 5 sec. and we watched it go out of sight over the horizen . The light was not flashing  , it was on the whole time . At first I thought that it was a falling star but when it went the intire distance of the sky I knew that it wasn't . There was no tail , just a bright light going very fast .;39.4251;-81.4613
Bright balls of light over SE Ohio;2003-05-03 23:20:00;00:05;Bright balls of light over SE Ohio I was driving on St. Rt. 676 taking a friend home from a party. He had been drinking, I had not. We were talking when he said (my name), look at that! and I turned and in the SW corner of the horizon there were 2 VERY white VERY bright circular balls of white light. They looked about 1/4 inch big each to me, and one was slightly lower. I have no way of determining distance, and therefore their size, as I had no landmarks to go against. I slowed the car down from about 55mph to 20mph and watched the VERY bright VERY white lights stay there until we passed into a heavily forested area. My friend asked me to turn around and I did and we came back around the same bend about a minute later than when we had first seen it (there were no places to turn around) and nothing was there. We sat there for 3 - 4 minutes waiting to make sure it wasn't some kind of flashing light or an airplane, but all we saw were just the same red flashers on the water tower that was in the due south direction. There were no towers, oil well drillings or other man made objects nearby. The objects did remain stationary.  Information about we the observers - we are both outdoorsmen who have seen most natural lights and occurances while camping (aurorea borealis, meteores, etc) and this truely disturbed us. It was the brilliance and clarity of the light that was the most disturbing.;39.4251;-81.4613
Numerous lanterns seen in the sky, as well as a few still being released.;2016-10-08 20:56:00;5 minutes;Numerous lanterns seen in the sky, as well as a few still being released. On October 8th at 8:56 PM, my husband and I were coming off I-77 at Marietta, Ohio, when we noticed lanterns going up in the air.  I took a picture of them and as we were going by the Best Western Motel on Pike Street we noticed that they were coming from behind the motel.  We could see the fire flickering as they rose in the air.  There were several already in the air and a few were just going over the street. As we continued on Pike Street I took more pictures and watched until I could no longer see them as we continued driving.

Large red light above the clouds moving west to east in the northern sky.;2020-06-03 05:00:00;30 seconds;Large red light above the clouds moving west to east in the northern sky. I noticed a rather brilliant point of light about thirty degrees above the horizon in the northern sky, brighter than Venus, or any star I normally see.  Upon a second look, I see a solid red light moving in a horizontal line from west to east.  As I tried to determine what it was, the light began to flicker slightly, then flicker more as I realized it was passing behind a bank of Cirrocumulus clouds until it disappeared, obstructed by the clouds.  It became apparent the size of the red light was rather large at the altitude above the cloud bank, further eliminating the airplane, or drone possibility.  It was seemingly more likely to be an asteroid above the atmosphere, reflecting the morning sunrise not yet illuminating the sky.;39.4251;-81.4613
