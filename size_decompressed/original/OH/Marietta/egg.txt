Driving down State Route 550, a bright white light appeared on the tree line and shone up into the sky.  It appeared to be a football or egg-shape with bright white lights with a greenish tint underneath of it.  These lights revealed metallic legs underneath but a clear view of its underside was limited due to the intensity of the lights.  The craft didn't make a sound, even as I drove right under it.  I pulled into my driveway half a mile down and when I got onto the hill it had disappeared.  This is the third time I have seen a craft of similar shape and lights on this state route, a family member has also seen it twice.  I couldn't take a picture because of a car behind me.  I feel like reporting this is crazy, but I have seen things like this before.  The last time I saw it I had strange bruises on my arms and legs and an experience as though I missed time.  I was writing a report and next thing I knew it was over 45 minutes later.  This has been seen on the same road by multiple people.  I have friends that have seen it.  I think there should be someone looking in to this.;39.4251;-81.4613
