Huge city block length sighting in Marietta Ohio with 4 huge lights;2021-01-07 23:30:00;5-6 minutes;Huge city block length sighting in Marietta Ohio with 4 huge lights I began hearing a very loud roaring like an airplane but this was much louder and vibrated everything around. I then saw 4 large yellowish lights directly above 2 buildings 2 blocks over that was slowly approaching my direction they then stopped above the buildings, directly above the buildings probably 20 foot. They were as wide as the 2 city buildings. It hovered there for a few minutes swaying side to side then it backed up slowly started to turn and then disappeared into thin air....it was too big to have went behind the buildings and flew away it would have been seen no matter what direction it would have went;39.4251;-81.4613
Very slow moving craft with red and green lights accelerating at incredible speed.;2021-06-07 21:00:00;20 minutes;Very slow moving craft with red and green lights accelerating at incredible speed. June 7th 2021 Marietta, OH. approx. 9:00 pm  I was looking to the SSW right before dark and noticed a green and red flashing light just above the neighbors house. The cloud cover was very low so the object was not very high in the sky. The object never made any sound and traveled so slow at times I thought it was hovering. I watched it for 12 to 15 minutes. It was traveling NNE like it was following the Ohio River. I kept trying to figure out what is was, not a plane(too slow) and the strobe period is not right(too slow), maybe it's a blimp. Yeah, it's a blimp because I can see shape of the lights like on a billboard. Maybe it will turn up the Muskingum River like it was heading towards Akron. Instead it kept going in the same direction, slowly getting closer. The lights were a circle of red lights with one being a vertical square bar on top. The green lights were arranged in a triangle with a long horizontal green bar on the bottom and individual lights on the sides (see Fig. 1). Flashing red then green, red then gree! n. With no warning the object took off at incredible speed to the East(see Fig. 2). It was so fast that I think my eyes blended the red and green lights into a yellow streak . Never have I seen anything like that, so I thought I should report it.;39.4251;-81.4613
