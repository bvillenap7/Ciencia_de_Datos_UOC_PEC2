V-shaped lights in Marietta, Ohio Oct. 8, 2016;2016-10-08 20:00:00;1 minute;V-shaped lights in Marietta, Ohio, Oct. 8, 2016 I would like to report a strange group of lights that I saw on Oct. 8, 2016, between 8:00 and 9:00 PM in Marietta, Ohio.   I was driving South on Pike St. (Route 7), when I saw a group of slow moving lights that were low and appeared to be moving North up the Ohio River.  The lights were formed in a “V” pattern, much like a flock of birds or geese.  They were amber in color.  Each light had an individual “V” shape as well.   I pulled my car over to watch and they kept moving up the Ohio River until I lost sight of them.  I called my husband to tell him to go outdoors to see them, but he could not see any activity.  We live approximately 3 miles from where I had seen the lights.   I called the Reporting Center today, Nov. 1, 2016, with this information.;39.4251;-81.4613
