Cube-shaped UFO;1995-06-01 22:00:00;30 Seconds;While outside feeding our dog, a cube-shaped UFO came overhead.  It was very low to the ground, and made a vacuum sound.  It had red and white lights on it.  It moved at about 100 miles per hour. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));41.8712;-80.66
8:30 P.M. EST August 31, 2004-resembled airplane explosion in atmosphere ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.  PD));2004-08-31 20:37:00;one hour;8:30 P.M. EST August 31, 2004-resembled airplane explosion in atmosphere to unaided, naked eye I had been talking to my sister on my cell phone outside around 8:30 P.M. Tuesday, August 31, 2004. I was the first person in my family to see the shape in the sky around 8:35 P.M. EST. I watched the shape for several minutes, which upon first glance resembled an exploded airplane to the naked eye. It never once seemed to be a comet or round object, but I could tell it was very high in the atmosphere. There was a distinct long, white, horizontal bar in the center of what looked like debris, or white light radiating from the bar. Watching it five minutes later with binoculars, the shape had moved north and the debris, or white light had dissipated enough so that the white bar had disappeared, and the debris field, or white light had separated into two very distinct halves. I had spoken to an older sister around 9:15 P.M. EST who lives in Florida, and she did not see it. The shape had continued to dissipate and move north toward Canada, then due east toward Pennsylvania until it had disappeared altogether around 9:30 P.M. EST. Please remember that much of my own account was seen by the naked eye. The moon had not yet risen, so it was fairly dark outside. My parents had used a telescope and binoculars through most of the observation whereas I had not. ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.

Three (3) witnesses to strange object in night sky  ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.  PD));2004-08-31 20:40:00;30 minutes nominal;Three (3) witnesses to strange object in night sky On Tuesday, August 31, 2004 at about 8:40 pm:  Our Daughter called my Wife and I to the front door of our house.  She told us that she saw a UFO in the sky.  I was very skeptical when approaching.  I really did not expect to see anything.  However, there was clearly something to see in the sky to the West of our location.  Our Daughter went in the house to find the binoculars and I went in to find the telescope and camera.  My Wife watched it while our Daughter and I went into the house.  When we came out, it was still there and was visible with the naked eye and very distinct when viewed through the binoculars.  I could not focus on it through the telescope nor could I find it in the viewfinder of my camera.  There did not seem to be enough light from the object to get it on the camera.  The night sky was dark, but very clear.  The moon had not risen yet.  And there were no visible clouds in the sky.  Two airplanes were visible in the sky, but appeared to be flying lower than the object in the sky and the size of this object was much larger than the airplanes.  The shape of the object, when viewed through the binoculars was like a cigar shape in the middle and 4 jetting protrusions curving away from the cigar like center.  Also, when looking through binoculars (7x50 power), the overall object looked to be gaseous in form.  However, it never lost its shape (I watched it for about 30 minutes).  The color was a gray to white, but of course this was about 8:45 pm and dark outside. The only other way I can describe the color was that it looked similar to viewing a comet, but of course the shape was not typical of a comet.  The tip of the object, on the cigar like center, had an intermittent flash that would occur about every 30 seconds.  This flash was not visible with the naked eye, only through binoculars.  The flash was like that of a dimly lit star, but as the object moved slowly across the sky (toward the East), the flash stayed at the point on the cigar portion of the object.  When the object was almost directly overhead, it appeared to move further away (higher in the sky).  It became fainter and harder to see.  Even looking through the binoculars, it held its shape but became smaller and dimmer.  At this point I went in the house. ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.
