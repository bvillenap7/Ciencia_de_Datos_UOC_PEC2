My mother and I were returning to her home in Wakeman, Ohio after shopping at a local store less than a mile away from home.  We checked out of the store at 9:14 pm and proceeded to turn right on Rt. 20 and left on Clark Street at almost Verlin Street I (the driver) noticed a large orange / yellow ball of light in the sky off to the right and called my mother's attention to the light. I thought it may be part of a firework display.  However, I realized quickly that it was not going up.  The light traveled from right to left across the sky for a while.  I noticed it was giving off enough light to light up the tops of the trees.  After it moved from right to left it hovered for a while and then went up slowly and dimmed then it brightened and moved down once again.  Finally, the ball of light went directly up very high in the sky before it dimmed or it went up so high the light was no longer visible.  The movement was slow at first then very accelerated.  The ! light was orange / yellow.  Also we stopped the car and noticed it did not make a sound.  We feel it was not a helicopter or a plane.;41.2637;-82.3782
