Travelling and Disappearing Starlight.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS overflight at 21:27 hrs.  PD));2009-07-26 21:30:00;5 mins;Travelling and Disappearing Starlight It was about 9:28 pm, just after dusk. I was in a parking lot surrounded by considerably open space.  To the north I noticed a light heading SW at the speed of an airplane.  The light looked only slightly bigger than Venus, and actually just looked like a travelling bigger star.  There was no pulsating, just a constant moving white light.  In about 90 seconds of observing, I heard the running of something with the sound of tennis shoes which suddenly stopped or disappeared as soon as I looked in its direction followed by an evanescent light relation. I noticed in addition, that when I looked at this travelling light in the sky from the side of my eye, there appeared to be a long beam stretching seemingly all the way back.  However, this sight was quickly lost, and could not be seen straight on.  I tested this 5-6 times, and everytime I got the same result.  About 1-2 minutes later, I saw the light qucikly dim.  Then a few seconds later the light disappeared completely with no help of clouds.  This was the only msytical aspect of the experience, everything seemed rational albeit unexplained.

Orange lights over the night sky in formation. Close without any noise moving slowly then fading away;2013-08-16 21:45:00;10 minutes;Orange lights over the night sky in formation. Close without any noise moving slowly then fading away Last night on a clear night (No clouds, no wind) I saw a light formation similar to the Phoenix Lights that was popular years ago.  It was very close with zero sound (Maybe 500 yards).   First I thought only helicopters could move so slow, but there was no noise and I know what planes sound like (I'm ex-Navy working many years with helicopters and planes).  They kept floating or slowly traveling from one side of the sky to the other (North to South?), then disappear, but with more appearing, about 20 in total.;40.0326;-82.8799
