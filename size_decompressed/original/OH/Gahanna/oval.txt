Me and 3 of my friends were climbing a tree in my front yard when i noticed 2 large ovals of white light moving in oppisite directions.  I yelled to the friend closest to me that there were two bright lights low to the ground. As soon as i pointed out the orbs started to come closer together and one picked up speed and left our view and the other started to move back and forth.  I yelled for my friends to come up to the tree so they could see it and we all watched it move back and fourth for 5 minutes before it disapeared behind a house.  When this happend, we all got down from my tree and ran towards the corner of my block to get a better view of the craft.  As soon as we got to the cprner, it flew directly over us and it was then that i could get a better view of it.  It was a perfect oval with a very bright white glow that i could see on the ground as it flew past. It had small black dots in the front of it that curved all the way around to about the middle of! the ship, looking like a C.  After we ran around the block trying to see it again, we say 3 fighter jets which we believed to be f-16's fly over my house in the same direction that the craft had gone.  This was about 10 minutes after the 2nd craft had disappeared from view.  That was the last of the activity we saw that night.;40.0326;-82.8799
