Gigantic geometric orbs change shape over city.;2013-07-12 22:00:00;3 minutes;Gigantic geometric orbs change shape over city. On the evening of July 12, 2013, myself and 3 other witnesses saw a huge configuration of geometric orbs , golden in color change shape over downtown Hamilton!  We were sitting on the raised patio , outside a local bar by the Columbia bridge , just west of the Great Miami River, and suddenly , about a half mile away, over downtown Hamilton a configuration of Golden orbs appeared, some 1,000 feet above the Historic Monument at Front Street . First it appeared as a Chevron , then within a minute it changed to a triangle then a square. It seemed to be silent , as we heard no roar or sounds . Then the object moved to the north slowly and picked up speed and disappeared within a few seconds , toward Middletown, Ohio .  The witnesses were 2 professional businessmen and their girlfriends who know the difference between stars , planets and swamp gas .;39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416
