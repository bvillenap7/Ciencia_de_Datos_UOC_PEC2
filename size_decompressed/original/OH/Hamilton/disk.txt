Black Area In Night Sky;2004-05-10 01:00:00;10-15min;Black Area In Night Sky I like to go out late at night and look at the stars and planets. I went out this night to look and see if I could see any metorites. I spend alot of time in my hobby room, which is in the garage, working on and talking CBs. I heard some strange static and walked outside to see if the transformer on the pole outside my house was arcing, it wasnt. I started looking up to see if I could see anyting when I saw a black portion of the sky, no stars were visable, as I watched the black spot the stars in the rear of the spot became visable and the stars in front dissappeared. At first I thought OK that is just a cloud, but as I watch the black area moved SIDEWAYS. There was a slight breeze blowing West to East, the black area moved roughly North. There was no sound from the black area that I could hear. Several dogs in the neighborhood were barking and howling. The black area moved out of my sight after about 10-15min.
