Pulsating giant spiked ball floats in West Hamilton sky;2013-07-10 22:00:00;40 minutes;Pulsating giant spiked ball floats in West Hamilton sky On the evening of July 10 , 2013 , 3 people witnessed an unusual object just floating in the crystal - clear night sky, appearing approx. 25 degrees above the western horizon in Hamilton, Ohio . It seemed to not really move and was stationary, gigantic in size , and was illuminated. Spikes protruded from the object that were pulsating colors:  Red on the tips of each spike , then white to the body of the balled object and the balled object pulsed a blue light itself. After viewing for a good half-hour, it slowly began to either move at a rapid speed towards the western horizon or descend to the ground.  The tree tops at the end of the street prevented the 3 witnesses from verifying its motion.  The distance from the witnesses to the object was at least 5 miles and yet the object was still as huge as a football field!  Duration of the sighting was about 40 minutes . Witnesses included a teenage boy in Jr. High School and 2 Adults , one retired the other in Professional employment . All 3 agree not ever having seen an object of such size and acting manner before and could easily see the difference between the stars in the night sky and this unusual object .;39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416
