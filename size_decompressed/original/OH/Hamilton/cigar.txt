Metallic cylindrical object with rounded ends,Daylight sighting;1999-10-22 09:00:00;2 minutes;Metallic cylindrical object with rounded ends,Daylight sighting I looked up and saw this object. It was in the west, moving southwest. I was along the east bank of the Great Miami river.  It was clear where I was but morning fog lingered to the south. There there were clouds to the south as well. It appeared to be at normal airplane altitude but moving slowly. Its appparent speed was that of a jet at high altitude but it seemed to be much lower. It appeared as long as my thumb is wide, veiwed at arm's length. The ends seemed brighter than its length, the ends seemed shiny, the length grey-white. It was moving into the low clouds. I knew that it would disappear before I could get a camera or antoher witness. I kept thinking that my mind was playing tricks on me.  I thought my perspsective would change or angle of view, or something, would change.... that it would turn out to be an airplane or even a blimp. If it was a blimp or dirigible I would have seen more detail (GOODYEAR or FUJI, cockpit etc.) It looked like nothing more or less than a slow flying tube w/ rounded, mirrored end.  Definitely an UNIDENTIFIED flying object.;39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416
