It had a large head and a long tail as if it were a comet, filling about twenty percent of the visible horizon, Glowing green yellow and blue. As the fireball moved across, it remarkably maintained altitude, from our perspective.  The most interesting feature was as the colored lights dimmed to disappear,  the trail was still intact, but there were five or six small glowing dots continuing to follow the same trajectory. It reminded us of some sort of a delivery phenomenon, the largest ball in front burning into oblivion (or disappearing) while leaving a trail of smaller things behind it perhaps one-tenth in size, relative to the leading fireball. The Largest Fireball was about the size of my thumbnail, and the tail would have been the length of my forearm. I am 6'6. We heard no sounds.;39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416
15 fireballs in sky moving at a good speed.;2013-09-14 23:00:00;30 minutes;15 fireballs in sky moving at a good speed. Around 10-11pm on Saturday night September 14th, 2013, while sitting around a firepit with friends we observed several (15-20) orangish reddish fireballs in the sky in Hamilton Ohio.  They kept coming about every 15 to 45 seconds and flew same direction.  No sound to them, seemed to be about the same speed as an airplane and maybe a bit lower in the sky than a plane.  They were not floating, but moving at a good speed.  We do not what they were, but we do know they were NOT a floating lantern or an airplane.;39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416

Orange-red flaming orb travelling constant speed, direction and altitude.;2014-07-04 22:15:00;1 minute;Orange-red flaming orb travelling constant speed, direction and altitude. At apx. 10:15 pm on July 4, my wife and I were sitting out back of the house watching fireworks from around the neighborhood.  My wife, who is far more observant than me, was also watching behind us and pointed out the object to me, and asked me what it was.  Initially, I thought it was an aircraft in distress as it appeared to be on fire.  However, after watching it for a time, I dismissed that notion, for several reasons:  1) it maintained its’ altitude  2) it had no aircraft lighting  3) it made no sound.   The object was flying roughly northeast to southwest.  It was, at its nearest position, apx. ½ away and had only 1000-2000 ft. of altitude.  It was orange-red with roughly a circular to elliptical shape.   The flames gave it almost a teardrop, or hershey’s kiss, shape at times, as they rose above and mostly centered about the object.  The underside of the object appeared to be flatter and only glowing, while the flame appearance was around and about the sides or! middle of the object.   Even though the object was moving at a constant speed the flames did not trail the object.  I’ve observed many night sky objects including Sputnik I or II, numerous satellites, manned NASA spacecraft, comets and meteors, but I’ve never observed anything like this.   I am a retired designer from a local manufacturer of turbine engines.;39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416
