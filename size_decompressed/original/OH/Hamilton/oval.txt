I viewed from Rt 4 on a hill overlooking the city. Blinking white lights. I was driving in my car down Route 4 coming into Hamilton from Middletown direction which sits higher than the city.  It was completely dark outside and as I was driving I glanced to the SE of the city (my L)and seen a metallic oval shaped ship. It had blinking white lights that marqueed around the middle section. It hovered approximately 1000 ft above the ground and for about five minutes. I had time enough to pull my vehicle over and stare in wonderment.  When it took off straight up it almost disappeared it went so fast. I checked into local airports and no testing was indicated. I also reported this to Wright Patt in Dayton.;39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416
