Hello, It said not to gives names of any place or person.

So I'll just give a jist of what me and another had seen. It was about March of this year, and about midnight or so. We were both in a park close to our house watching the stars. We had both caught on to a small a lazily drifting light, that at first we had precieved to possibly be an air plane, As we had even seen a red light flash on it once, but then I guess you could say the object became more visible, the outline was serpintine. And it made a slithering like motion across the sky as a series of lights flashed in order down the side of it, starting from the first initial light. We both debate whether it was 4 or 6 lights that flashed in total, but all light up once it had finished this slither. And it started to connect to make a circleof lights, then it vanished. I shall find someone to make an illustration when contacted.;39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416
