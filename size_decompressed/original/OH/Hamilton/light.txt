I heard a sound in the sky, like a whoosh, I look up and there is a round light streaking across the sky, followed by app. 14 more, one right after the other, maybe  2 seconds between each.  the park was full, so surely some one saw this besides me.  I was 16-17 at the time, but i am 40 now and i remember it like it was yesterday ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416

Red-Lighted UFO;2009-10-29 21:00:00;45 Seconds;Red-Lighted UFO UFO SIGHTING  10/29/2009  This just happened about an hour ago. I got online to look up UFO’s and found this site, so I thought I’d post. Location: Hamilton, Ohio  Me and my mom were driving on the highway and my said, Look at those lights.  I start looking around, not knowing if she meant an airplane, a car, or a house. After a second I looked in the sky and saw it. First, a red light popped up, out of nowhere, then another, until there was four red lights, in a horizontal line which kind of looked like a bar. Then in the same order, the lights went out and it disappeared. That is what I saw. The whole thing lasted about 45 seconds. My mom and I started talking and she said that she saw the same thing, but white lights. I don’t know what that means. The entire ride home, we were looking for it, to see if maybe it was an airplane or something like that. It was definitely nowhere to be found. I was a little scared, excited and in disbelief. That isn’t the first time I have seen a UFO, but the last time I did, I was about 9years old. It was just unexpected.;39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416
Orange lights traveling across the night sky in Hamilton, Ohio;2011-10-29 21:55:00;5 mins;Orange lights traveling across the night sky in Hamilton, Ohio I was sitting at a stop light when I observed seven orange lights traveling horizontally at a fast pace and in close formation across the sky and then begin disappearing one by one.  I attempted to follow them but, lost sight temporarily when I turned a corner.  At the point where I lost visibility, there were 3 lights vertical to each other with the other lights in front of and behind them at varying levels.   When I regained visibility, there were 2 lights traveling vertical to each other that went across the sky and disappeared into the tree line.  It did not appear to me have the shape of one object but, rather a series of seperate lights all in close formation.;39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416
