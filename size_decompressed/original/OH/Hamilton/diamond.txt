Detailed sighting in Southwest Ohio a little over an hour after the Collinsville sighting.;2003-10-15 20:45:00;10 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by Mr. Kenny Young, noted UFO investigator in Ohio.  We express our gratitude to Kenny for sharing this report with NUFORC.  His website is the following:   http://home.fuse.net/     PD)) Detailed sighting in Southwest Ohio a little over an hour after the Collinsville sighting. This report below is from UFO Research: Cincinnati and it took place a little over an hour after my sighting of the Collinsville object and was reported by the person named in the report. Southwest Ohio was having a very busy week in mid October. Note that the object left heading towards Oxford, Ohio and would have passed Collinsville on the way to Oxford.  ====================================================================================  Subject: UFO SIGHTING LOCATION: Hamilton, OH (Butler County) DATE: October 15, 2003 - 8:45 p.m. SUMMARY  Stuart L***** (name used with permission in original site) telephoned the Cincinnati UFO Hotline (513-588-4548) to report sighting an unusual object. Within minutes, he was contacted at the phone number he provided (on file) and explained that around 8:45 p.m., he was at his Hamilton, Ohio residence and walking past a window (facing north) when he spotted an unusual object.  The object, L***** said, was in the sky situated directly over the Hamilton High School in Hamilton, Ohio (Butler County) and was described as a multi-colored upside down diamond rotating in place very slow. L***** estimated the object was around 45 degrees above the horizon at a possible elevation of 25,000 feet, about the height of normal airplanes, he said, situated from his perspective 'directly over the High School.'  The witness said that there were a few lights on the object, but for the most part, it was luminous. The witness described a mutli-colored, self emanating glow which the object seemed to radiate, making the shape of the object visible against a dark sky.  L***** said the diamond-shaped object had changed color from red, green, blue, to white, and the lights were rotating, not flashing.  He estimated the object was 1/4 mile long but said that, at arms length, the object was as big as his pinky fingernail.  The object was visible for an estimated 10-minutes. L***** said he was about to grab a camcorder and the object took off at an incredible speed to his left, or west toward the Oxford area.  This thing just sped away as if going into warp speed, L***** said. I couldn't believe it.  He described its acceleration as 'extreme.'  L***** also said that two military jets had traveled overhead about 20-minutes after the sighting, probably flying from South to north. They were apparently flying high and out of sight, but L***** estimated they were military aircraft due to turbine sound of engines.  Sky conditions were clear at the time with temperatures in the 50s.  COMMENT  On September 24, 2003, a Franklin, Ohio resident contacted Wright Patterson Air Force Base to report sighting a pattern of green flashing lights around 10:30 p.m. near her home at the Heartland Subdivision. Franklin is around 17-miles northeast of Hamilton.  Filed, October 15, 2003 KENNY YOUNG -- UFO Research http://home.fuse.net/ufo;39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416
