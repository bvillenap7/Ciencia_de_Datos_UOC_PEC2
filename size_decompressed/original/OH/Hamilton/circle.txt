3 sightings that I've seen that I want you to know of;1997-06-01 07:00:00;10 minutes;3 sightings that I've seen that I want you to know of Hi, I have seen 3 sightings to date actually, i'm 20 yrs old and a strong believer of extraterrestrial intelligence. The first one was in Hamilton located flying above Wilson Jr. High school on the first day of school in 1997. As far as i can remember is was a silver rounded object hovering above the school for about a few minutes not moving at all, it was about the height that average planes fly but made no sound and many students saw it but never said anything of it. I'm still unsure of what it was. It light as day out and too bright to see any kindof satellite flying that low. The second and third sightings were exactly the same and located about two miles south of downtown Hamlton at around 10PM the first and 2AM the second time. They were two glowing lights, just lights slowly moving in differant directions as I saw riding in my car by the great miami river on the west side of town. I've seen these two lights in the same location twice and I strongly don't believe they are planes because they just hovered around the same area for about 30 minutes each time without any blinking lights. There is an airport there that just has small planes, none of them are capable of doing, or look like these two objects, They where white lights . I am a very openminded person and I would not give you a fake report or anything, as I, like so many want to know the truth about what is happening. Unfortunatly I have no proof of these objects but I read another report on your site about someone from Hamilton who sighted the two flying objects I saw. Thanks for reading my report, I'm sorry that my sightings were sometime ago.;39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416
On November 06, 2012 we (five of us) at 7:30 pm saw seven to ten bright &quotballs&quot of light (orange in color) in the sky.;2012-11-06 19:30:00;20 seconds;On November 06, 2012 we (five of us) at 7:30 pm saw seven to ten bright &quotballs&quot of light (orange in color) in the sky. I was driving west on Princeton Road in Hamilton, Ohio.  I had in the car my youngest son (8-yrs age), my daughter (16-yrs age) and two of her friends (both 16-yrs).  It was starting to get dark and lights in the sky caught my eye.  I was turning off Princeton Road taking my daughter's friend home and this allowed us to park the car.  We got out and watched the lights which appeared round and orange in color.  They were not rapidly moving, but they were in motion.  I did not count but there was near 7 to 10 lights moving in random directions.  I could not tell how far or how big the lights actually were cause I did not any relative distance marker.  We watched near 20 to 30 seconds then the bright balls of light just disappeared.  My daughter compared the sight to an animated movie caused Tangels where Chinese lanterns were set off into the sky.  I don't know what we saw but it was an event unlike anything I have seen.  I am forty-five yrs age and never give! n UFO sightings much thought only in the movies.  But we saw something that may be can be explained by facts that I don't know about like Chinese lanterns or bright hot air balloons.  My daughter attempted to video the sight via her cell droid phone but could not get the images focused.;39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416
Circular objects with multi-colored lights seen hovering near Butler County Regional Airport;2015-10-06 20:50:00;1 hour;Circular objects with multi-colored lights seen hovering near Butler County Regional Airport My boyfriend and I were driving home when we both saw 2 objects in the sky that quickly flew towards each other and appeared as though they were about to collide.  One of the objects flew out of sight while one remained in the same spot, not moving.  The object appeared to be roundish and had blinking lights in multiple colors. Once we returned home we observed the object for an hour.  We went in the house for about 30 minutes and we came back out to see if the object was still there, and it was gone.  At 23:00 we went out again and saw the object again, this time in a different spot, but still not moving.  I was able to zoom in with my camera and confirm that there were blinking multi-colored lights;39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416

It pulsed irregularly I've never seen anything like it.  Moved from West to East very slowly until it faded away.  Looked as if it maybe had just turned to where the light wasn't having me anymore instead of just disappearing.  The intensity of the light was that of like welding something.;39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416
