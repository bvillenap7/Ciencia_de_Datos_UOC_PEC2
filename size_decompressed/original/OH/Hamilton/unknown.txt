Black Area;2004-06-29 23:00:00;10nim;Black Area I was working in my radio room when I heard some strange static. I had heard the same static befor when I saw the black area. I went outside to look for the black  area and sure enought it was there. I guess it was about 150 feet in size. The stars were NOT visable in the black area. As the area moved slowly the stars in the rear of the area came into view and the stars in front dissappeared. The sky was clear except for this area. The dogs in the neighborhood were barking and howling. The area moved against the wind and slowly move from SE to NW. I have seen this black area in the sky one other time but it may be there other times. There was no noise from the area except maybe a slight hum. It sure causes the dogs to go nuts and causes weired static on my CB radios.;39.4196741935477;-84.5795459677416
