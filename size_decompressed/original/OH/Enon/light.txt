Hovering bright light with no noise.;2001-06-30 05:00:00;5 minutes;Hovering bright light with no noise. I was driving to work and was heading west on route 4 towards Enon, OH, when a very bright stationary light caught my eye.  It was ahead of me up and to the right at the 1:00 position.  For the next 5 minutes to my exit it stayed in the same position.  I took the exit to Enon and, since it was so early and there was no one behind me, I stopped the car and rolled the window down.  The light was approximately 500' off the ground and made absolutely no noise but continued to hover overhead.  I waited for any change in this light but saw nothing other than the white light with no noise.  I finally left and continued to work as usual.  This route is one I took regularly.  Never before nor after have I seen this very bright stationary light.  This area is within 15 minutes of Wright Patterson Air Force Base.  I've lived here all my life and I am not a user of drugs or alcohol.  I've never seen anything like it.;39.8646;-83.9348
