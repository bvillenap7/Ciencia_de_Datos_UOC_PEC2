Coming from US 30 south to Lex Springmill RD..  I saw a row of lights in the sky.  They were too high to be parking lot lights.    When I approched  the traffic light at Lex Springmill, the craft passed over my car.  It was really dark in the sky.  I saw real bright lights, blinding bright.  When it when over me..  There were no tail lights.  No side lights,, just the 8-10 lights in front.  No sound and it blended in the dark night sky.;40.7627;-82.5593
