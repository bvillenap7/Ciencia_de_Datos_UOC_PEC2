It has been replaced on the same date by a non-triangular craft report from Knoxville, Tenn. Please re-locate my original Ontario, OH report and return it to its original place in the 03/11/04 date section.;40.7627;-82.5593
Very large noiseless triangular  craft glides slowly south across Ohio's evening  March sky near Mansfield -Ontario area;2004-03-11 21:00:00;40 seconds;Very large noiseless triangular  craft glides slowly south across Ohio's evening  March sky near Mansfield -Ontario area We were driving northeast on Route 309 about four miles out of Ontario, Ohio, at approximately 8:45-9 p.m., when, sitting in the front passenger's seat, I saw a huge triangular craft glide somewhat slowly across Rt. 309 and proceed in the same manner (about 50 MPH) southwesterly in a direction pointed toward Columbus, OH. The back side of the tri-craft was at least 50 feet across. The other two sides would measure similarly, I would estimate. There were six or seven pale yellow lights underneath. There was no particular uniformity about the position of the lights. The craft was no more than 100-125 feet above us. I yelled to my friend and driver to look up. Because of brisk traffic coming in both directions, he could not stop the car but he did manage to slow down and lean to the right in time to also get a brief glimpse of it.;40.7627;-82.5593
