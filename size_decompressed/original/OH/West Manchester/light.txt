Flashing white light approx. tree top level.;2000-01-03 21:30:00;30 seconds to 1 minute;Flashing white light approx. tree top level. Returning home from work on night of the 3rd saw a bright flasing light about tree top level 2 $1/2 to 3 miles east of West Manchester. Light was very bright and was durring a heavy rain storm. Light flashed at regular intervals on 1 second off 2 seconds approx. Saw light just above tree tops and as I approached it seemes to drop below the tree line and was bright enough to back light the trees. I didn't really think anything about it at the time other than it was kind of unusual. Then I recieved this site location from a friend who didn't know of the sighting and thought it might warrent a report.;39.8998;-84.617
