Each time the object seemed to come in front of the window from the sky. It flashed continually while there and after 1 min. seemed to shoot in a diagonal direction back into the western sky each time.Each stated they shot away like a check mark.  One thought maybe it was car headlights shining in , but didn't hear a car engine outside at the time. The other one stated he thought it appeared as bright as lightening and thought it was. There weren't any storms in the area at that time . It was a dry period.Both times it appeared as a white light about as bright as car headlights.It did not make any sound according to both teens.
