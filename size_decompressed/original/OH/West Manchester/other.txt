White jet seen disappearing after passing through a trail left by a jet.;2000-09-28 14:00:00;5 seconds;White jet seen disappearing after passing through a trail left by a jet. A white jet plane flying from south to north had just crossed the path of a jet contrail left by a plane flying from the east to the west that continued the flight path from east to west leaving a jet trail from horizon to horizon. The white jet simply disappeared from my view in blue skies just to the north of the jet trail it had just passed through.I was video taping the activity of the jets leaving trails that day because I was so alarmed to see the numerous jet activity in our area and the trails being left by them flying in our area. I replayed the portion of video that the white jet was seen to disappear in blue skies during the taping. I could not determine that it was visible in the video, only a comment made by me on the portion of video it should have been visible. I made a comment about the fact that white jets seem to be involved in this activity that are oddly disappearing from sight in blue skies.I also have 35mm photos of the trails left that day.;39.8998;-84.617
