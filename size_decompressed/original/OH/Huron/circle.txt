I observed a dual UFO siting Wed night 3-26 at approximately 10:30 PMEastern time in Huron, Ohio.  2 objects appeared in the sky, coming fromthe NW (from huron) over Lake Erie.  They passed over Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio and took a 90 degree turn to the West, and vanished.  The objects were round, extremely illuminated, and although flying together,were not attached - they were zig zagging and not together, although generally in the same line of flight.  The objects were about 3 times the size of a star, not colored, and moving at an extremely high rate ofspeed.  They moved faster than any plane, or anything else I everobserved in the sky.  They were white in color, not blinking and slightly larger than an airplane would appear to be.Background of observer: 51 yr old American, married, professionaland business owner.  Observation was made while looking for aview of the comet.;41.3768;-82.5363
