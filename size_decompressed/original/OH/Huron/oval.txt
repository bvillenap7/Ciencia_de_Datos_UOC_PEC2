I walked out on the deck overlooking the river and could not see it anymore.  Then I caught movement from upriver and saw another glowing object it seem to be on the same track as the first.  I called my wife and she joined me in looking at the craft.  This too was glowing an orange color and looked to be a couple of thousand feet in altitude.  It made no sound, no wake, and was moving no faster than a light plane.  I cannot say how big the craft was I had no reference to compare.  Maybe some like an MD88 although it was more of a globular shape. Seen many aircraft in life but nothing like these UFOs.;41.3768;-82.5363
