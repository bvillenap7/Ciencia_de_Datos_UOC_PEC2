((Starlink satellites??);2019-12-22 21:30:00;15 minutes;There were a series of 'star like' images across the sky in a straight diagonal line, a procession of them, moving slowly in a Northern direction.  They moved across the sky and as one disappeared, another would emerge at the end of the line.  Approximately a dozen would show in a straight line, top of the line disappearing at one point as another appeared at the bottom of the line.  Eventually the line diminished as the last one disappeared.  There were five witnesses that saw it all.;41.3768;-82.5363
