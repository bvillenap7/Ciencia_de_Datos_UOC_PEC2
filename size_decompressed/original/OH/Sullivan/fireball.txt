Sighting occurred while sitting on the deck at our camper on a partly cloudy night. We saw a roundish, glowing, orange ball glide across the sky from south to north. It moved with the silence, steadiness, and speed of a satellite but it was definitely below the clouds and visible to the horizon, where we lost sight of it due to trees.  It was a soft orange glow easily visible but not bright, just a glowing ball of fire gliding across the sky.

Sounds like that’s what you saw.”;41.0332;-82.2154
