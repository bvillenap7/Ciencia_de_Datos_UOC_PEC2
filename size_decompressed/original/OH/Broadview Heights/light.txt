I looked due E and just N of due east appeared a light brighter than a shooting star/meteor moving L to R. ((anonymous report));2017-10-04 05:09:00;2 seconds;I looked due east and just north of due east appeared a light brighter than a shooting star/meteor moving left to right at an immense speed and then as quickly as I saw the object it was gone.  This did not have a flashing light or anything that would make it appear to be an airplane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
