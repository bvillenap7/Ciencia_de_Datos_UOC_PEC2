Bright orange cigar shaped UFO outside of Cleveland, Ohio;2002-06-15 19:30:00;5 minutes;Bright orange cigar shaped UFO outside of Cleveland, Ohio The object was a bright orangish/yellow color.  When I first noticed it, it stationary.  I remember thinking how odd it was that almost as soon as I noticed it, It began moving horizontally from north to south, and it appeared to be dancing up and down slightly.  It was not moving very fast.  When I first saw it, the first thing that came to mind was a blimp at night, only brighter.  It also moved faster than a blimp. Living between Cleveland and Akron, I've seen the Goodyear blimp at night returning to Akron after ballgames, and this was not a blimp, but it's shape was almost identical. I was the first to see the object and when I saw it, I ran inside to get someone to come out and see it.  My sister came outside and also saw it for a short time.  We got into her car and tried to find it again once it was out of sight.  I noticed a man who pulled his car over and was standing outside of it looking in the direction that the UFO was travelling.  I believe that he saw it too.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.314;-81.6755999999999

There were no fireworks in the sky in this area at the time and no sounds of fireworks.  This object had no lights and emitted no sound at all, it did not have any edges like a winged bird or known craft.  It simply glided above the tree line until out of our site.  My husband is former Air Force who worked on fighter jets and is very knowledgeable of aircraft and he has no idea of what we saw.;41.314;-81.6755999999999
