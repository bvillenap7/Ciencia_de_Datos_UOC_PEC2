Large black triangle observed close up flying away then reaapearing soon after.;2007-03-21 09:45:00;5 minutes;Large black triangle observed close up flying away then reaapearing soon after. My father, brother, and I were traveling home from a party. We turned onto Wyatt Road, and from considerable distance we observed two large white lights, right next to eachother combined in one craft. As we approached, the bright lights shut off and we could easily see the craft. It was a large triangle, maybe 200 feet long and 100 feet wide. It had 3 white lights in each of its corners, and smaller white lights in an indescribable patern on the bottom of it. The triangle was about 300 feet from the ground. It flew away from our car slowly until we lost view. After about a minute it reappeared out of nowhere. We arrived home and got out of the car to look at it. It slowly flew away in a NW direction.We were all shocked by the experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous provides e-mail address only.  PD));41.314;-81.6755999999999
