Me and my mother and grandfather are having a conversation on the supernatural. To the left right after 9:00 pm, we see a white light, small and distant, but large enough for us to notice. We thought it was a star, but after 10 minutes my grandma came out and said that it couldn't be because there would be a lot of stars. We were staring at it, also me remembering having this same experience about a year ago. It wasent moving, or doing anything. My grandma said that when she went to Serbia after the bombing in 1999, they saw something like this, but this was much more strange. Later, everybody went inside. Me being a freak on these things, I sit there at about 9:10 pm and am texting my friends and about to send message on facebook telling them to look outside, as I do this, I see it bounce as I am keeping an eye on it, ad watch it dissapear. Now the skies were clear that night. I get dressed into pajamas, come back out. Before I saw it to the left of my porch (facing west), but now I saw an object, I was facing south-east. It was the same, white circleish figure I saw before, but also I saw one on other side glimmering. They didn't move at this time. I'm staring, thinking. On the left one, it looked as if the UFO opened something and something floated our of the UFO and back into it, from/to the earths surface. Then I saw it dissapear. The other one stayed, bounced a little, and sped of to the north at the speed of light!;41.314;-81.6755999999999
