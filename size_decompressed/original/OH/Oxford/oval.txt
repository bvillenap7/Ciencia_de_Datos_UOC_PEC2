Oval silver flashing Object flying SE over Oxford, OH on a clear morning;2005-10-15 08:30:00;1 minutes;Oval silver flashing Object flying SE over Oxford, OH on a clear morning I was at a farmers' market in Oxford, OH when I looked up to the northwest on a very clear morning and saw a silver flashing object that I at first thought was a plane but as it got closer I could see it was not a plane. I told several other people to look up in the sky and they all agreed that it was not a plane nor a mylar ballon (object was shaped like a mylar balloon). Object was going on a steady SE course and despite windy conditions did not change course the way a balloon would in such wind. The Object seemed to be several thousand feet above the ground. It was sliver and flashed in the sunlight (it was a clear day with very high pressure, no clouds). It seemed to be rocking back and fourth as it flew SE, making it flash in the sunlight.;39.5107;-84.7427
