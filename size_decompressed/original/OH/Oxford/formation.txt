Broken Line of 20-40 Yellow/Orange Lights Norht of Oxford, Ohio.;2013-04-14 20:57:00;10 minutes;Broken Line of 20-40 Yellow/Orange Lights Norht of Oxford Ohio Was called by friend and her husband about 2 miles east of my location regarding some lights in the north.   She reported an estimated 20-40 roughly circular, yellow-to-whitish lights close to the northern horizon and I could see as well through trees that still lacked foliage and were no more than 200-300 feet from me.   The lights, larger than aircraft lights and slower had no flashing beacons.  They were not equidistant and were moving and moving east-to west and covered about 45 degrees from the northern horizon to the eastern.   Lights on the eastern horizon were brighter and closer together, perhaps due to perspective.   There was a thin, transparent layer of alto-cirrus clouds through which I could see stars and a barely bit of remaining glow from the sun which had set.  Seemed to be just below that deck.  In minutes they had all disappeared, seemingly, a few at a time.   Call to local police did not turn up any other reports.  Have not been able to confirm any local celebrations that might have release Japanese lanterns either.   Total witnesses known to date: 4 (me, my wife and my friend and her husband);39.5107;-84.7427
