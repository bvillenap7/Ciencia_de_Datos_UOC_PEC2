We were heading to wal mart when I saw a triangle shaped craft with a light on each corner. It was about 100-150 yds above.  No sound.  I knew it wouldnt be a helicopted or airplane. My cousin and I completely astonished.  Just following it down the highway about 300 yds in front of us. We followed it for about 30 seconds and it just shot up.  I've never seen anything like it.  It left so quickly and the direction it shot was like nothng ive seen before.  I have no explanation to what it could have been.  But I do know one thing, I used to think of unidentified objects as just a way of people getting attention.  But after that encounter I do not know what to believe..;39.5107;-84.7427
