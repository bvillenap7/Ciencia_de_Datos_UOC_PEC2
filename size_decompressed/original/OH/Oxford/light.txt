Slowly moving object in night sky seperates, comes together and changes colors in Ohio;2011-10-24 21:00:00;1-2 hrs;Slowly moving object in night sky seperates, comes together and changes colors in Ohio 3 people saw what looked like 1 star/planet moving slowly back and forth in the sky.  After a few minutes it broke into 3 separate objects/lights into a triangular pattern.  These moved about a little, and seemed to appear green and red as well as white.  It then appeared to come together and become one again.  This light seemed to change between white, green and red while very slowly moving about the sky, though not straying far from the original location.  Without a point of reference it was difficult to detect the movement.  We watched this for about 20 minutes, went inside for a 2-3 hours, when we went back out it was gone.

5 amber lights traveling east over Oxford OH;2013-08-02 21:45:00;5 minutes;5 amber lights traveling east over Oxford OH My wife and I counted a total of 5 objects traveling overhead at various intervals over approximately a 5 minute period.  All were traveling in a straight line east, taking 20-30 seconds to go from overhead to the horizon. They were vaguely round amber lights. All identical.  No shape was discernible.  I had a good pair of binoculars and followed #5 for nearly 30 seconds without being able to make out a source of this light or any recognizable shape of the light.  The lights did not flash or blink, and we heard nothing but the crickets.  They sometimes flickered near the horizon as they went through cloud cover. The first two flew very close to each other.  In fact, our impression was that they were the leading and tailing light of an airplane, since the second flowed closely behind the first (though as I said the color was wrong, and they were not blinking).  We were left perplexed, because while the speed and brightness suggested a low-flying aircraft, we should have heard it at that height. The other three lights were distinctly singular.  They did not apparently follow the same exact flight path as the first two, but did fly west to east.  The third came less than a minute later.  The last 2 came separately  2 or 3 minutes later.  All flew at a fairly uniform, constant speed. It was night, but no stars were visible because of clouds.  The source of the light was not very diffuse, so it may have been near the bottom edge of the clouds. I am a Visiting Professor of Sociology at a large University.  My wife works at a bank.  We and I are birders, so we recognize many of the ways people’s impression and memory of objects can be confused.  We have practiced methods we use to accurately describe and remember features of things we see (for example we describe objects we see out loud and verify them with one another as we’re seeing them).  I went inside to write down this description immediately thereafter.;39.5107;-84.7427
We saw 3 circular, white, fast moving lights moving high up in the sky.;2013-08-12 04:30:00;30 minutes;We saw 3 circular, white, fast moving lights moving high up in the sky.   The lights stopped multiple times and even converged near each other before going different directions. We watched one light for 30 minutes moving around.  It would stop in one spot then change course.   We even saw it move in a zig zag pattern multiple times. It also appeared that there were flashes of light coming from the object itself.

Gold light moving horizontally across the sky in the Ohio countryside.;2020-03-22 02:00:00;2-4 minutes;Gold light moving horizontally across the sky in the Ohio countryside. I was sitting in my car outside at around 2 am at my parents farm when I noticed a gold light moving horizontally.  It was moving erratically, but slowly across the sky until it went behind some trees. It was gold and bright.;39.5107;-84.7427
