Bell shaped object follows drivers in Ohio.;2011-10-24 22:30:00;10 minutes;Bell shaped object follows drivers in Ohio On the evening of October 24, 2012, ((sic.  2011)) 2 witnesses observed a Bell - shaped object move across the night sky, descending from the constellation of Orion (which was in the east) . The witnesses were driving on Ohio Rte. 27 south to rte. 130 which turns left onto the direction of the city of Hamilton, Ohio.  A very clear night . This very bright object caught the eye of the driver and began to fly down to just about what appeared to be a mile away.  When the vehicle turned on Rte. 130, the bright illuminated bell - shaped object seemed to follow them, ahead, to a point of what could have been 1 mile . But as it approached the vehicle , the driver stopped the car and got out and pointed to it.  It was a bell shaped object, 30-40 feet in diameter and it had  red and blue lights INSIDE that seem to twirl and was made up of giant clear light bulbs . It moved across the highway in a jerky motion and would move, then stop, move then stop . Suddenly all the wild life was quiet, no sound the craft made as it continued to descend to the south, behind the tree lines. The passenger in the vehicle saw the object but stated it appeared to be bright white light spinning at a fantastic rate.  They were inside the vehicle and viewed it through the windshield.  The witnesses tried to follow its descent but no roads led in that direction . ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrected date to 2011.  PD));39.5107;-84.7427
