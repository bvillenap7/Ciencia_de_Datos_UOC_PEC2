PD)) While I was driving on rt. 2, I was listening to music going to a friend's house I was looking ahead and I noticed a airplane or what I thought was a plane it was blinking then turned around I guess then it was two lights.   As I was driving closer it seem to get closer then stores maybe 1000 feet in the are and stayed there the entire time I was driving and a bad feeling I had to stop at a rest stop to understand what I just saw I called my friend and no one believed me at all?  So as I got to my friends house shortly after seeing whatever I saw I went out to smoke a cigarette and I'm telling you you could not make this up there was a bright light almost what I just seen but it was slightly higher than last time and I called my friend outside and we both watched as the light went from bright to dim red and disappeared.  I still don't know what just happened, I was afraid and I don't get afraid at all.;41.4445773195877;-82.7051587628868
