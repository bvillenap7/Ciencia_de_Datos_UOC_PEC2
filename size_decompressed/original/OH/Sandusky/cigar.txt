Something over lake Erie;2008-05-13 16:00:00;15 min;Something over lake Erie We were one the Cedar Point peninsula. About 15-20 miles away over lake Erie we saw what we first thought was a strange object moving very slowly. There were no lights. It seemed to move about a mile in the 15 minutes. It disappeared while we weren't looking.;41.4445773195877;-82.7051587628868
