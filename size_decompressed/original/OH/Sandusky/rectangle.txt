Large rectangular craft flew at an angle over my head, and disappeared into the horizon.;1999-06-01 21:00:00;5 seconds;Large rectangular craft flew at an angle over my head, and disappeared into the horizon. I was roller blading down Finch Street in Sandusky Ohio, at approximately 21:00, heading west-bound.   A very large rectangle tilted at an approximate 30 degree angle flew over top of my head at an unknown altitude.  It was glowing a pale orangish-yellow, and appeared to have circular lights spanning the entire width of the craft.   The object appeared to me as having dimensions of 5 feet wide by 6 inches high from where I was standing, but was probably much larger as I was unaware how high the object was.   It appeared 2-dimensional the entire time, and it continued to fly west-bound and eventually disappeared in the horizon.
