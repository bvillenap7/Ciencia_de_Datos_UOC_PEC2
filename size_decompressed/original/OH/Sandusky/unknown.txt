As always i always look at the stars when the stars start to appear. I am  an ordinary 12 year old kid and what happened was that i as always come out to look at the stars. I gor my chair, a bag of chips, and a coke and sat down and just stared. suddenly a bright light came from the sky. it was a little light. i looked at it curiosly. Then it started to go all wobbley. it moved in a puzzling format. Haze was all around it. I couldnt identify the shape because it was all haze. I went inside and i got my binoculars. Then I got out and i looked closley. i saw colors changing. at first i thought it was some type of aircraft but then suddenly it doubled it self. I called my dad out but as soon as he came it just sped away into hyperspace like youd see in a Star  Wars Movie. And thats it.
