It flew very slow and made no noise. It came from the south and went northward. My brother came in and said there was a ufo outside. I went outside and there it was. It was 8:30 pm and it was slightly southeast of gratis, OH. It is very cloudy and it kept vanishing into the clouds. It moved extremely slow. It was triangular and had a light on each corner. It had 3 more lights in the center. Two of the outer lights flashed alternately with one of the inner lights. The ufo had a glow around the edge that made its shape contrast against the sky. I went in to get a camera. I went back out at 8:45 and it was to far northward to get a picture.;39.7258;-84.5341
