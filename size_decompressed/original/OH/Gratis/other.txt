Video shot in Gratis, Ohio;2010-06-18 11:00:00;about 10 minutes;Video shot in Gratis, Ohio We have a video, which was shot by my friend. I did not personally witness this, but when she drove me back to show me the origin of the filming, this would have been over or very near to over my house. We do not have the video on youtube as of yet. The air show was in Dayton therefor we are not so sure that this was not flares or such. The behavior of the flares was interesting though in that they come and go, as opposed to just fading out in the way that the videos that we found that were similar did. We are not sure what this is, but my friend who filmed it and her brother continued to watch as they drove home, again seeming a little odd for flares. I do have the video posted on my blog and I would include the link here but I am not sure that would be appropriate. Please know this is not an attempt to spam.... but I am feeling that you have to see the video to answer the question of what it is. www.shyowl.net/blog  the title to the blog is Aliens in Ohio? The even actually includes a series of lights misbehaving. If one looks closely at the video, it appears that a large triangular shadow is behind the lights, however, we understand this is likely shadowing and not what it appears.
