There was no sound or any blinking lights. It moved from west to east in the night sky at approximatly 10:00 p.m. As it moved farther away from our location, it diminished to a smaller dot and disappeared. As bright as it was, it did not cast any light on the ground. It was somewhat high in the sky, but was several sizes larger than any of the planes that were flying overhead.;38.757;-83.8197

While talking on the phone with a friend, I observed a very bright light moving across the sky from SSW to ENE. I ask my friend who was on the phone to look at the sky from his location which is approximately 25-30 miles away, and he witnessed the same object moving across the night sky.;38.757;-83.8197
