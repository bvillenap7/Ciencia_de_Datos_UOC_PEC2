Flashing white lights moving at incredible speeds.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from aerospace employee.  PD));2014-09-18 21:30:00;30 minutes;Flashing white lights moving at incredible speeds. My wife and I were camping at Paint Creek State Park, Ohio and shortly after dark on Sept 18 (appx 9:30 pm) I noticed lights descending in the distance (toward Hillsboro, Oh). There was one lighted object and then immediately below another exactly the same light and then that was followed by three more immediately below the first two.   After that we observed flashing white lights above those and then saw the flashing lights in various areas of the night sky to the north and south of the first sightings and then the flashing lights were in the sky to the north, south and then to the east and then to the west moving at incredible speeds (I would estimate at least mach 3 to mach 4).   I have never seen anything like this before.  I have worked in the aerospace industry for more than 25 years and have never encountered anything even close to this.;39.2131;-83.2763
