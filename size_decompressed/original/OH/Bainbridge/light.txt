Red-orange lights spotted in night sky over Bainbridge, Ohio;2010-08-10 21:30:00;Approx. 20 min.;Red-orange lights spotted in night sky over Bainbridge, Ohio At approximately 9:30 p.m. Tuesday,  August 10, I was traveling home from a trip to the grocery store when I noticed a red-orange light in the sky.  I noticed the light because of its color, and the fact that it appeared to be at a low altitude, lower than planes would occupy, and it seemed to be hovering over the area. When I reached my home, about a minute and a half later, and looked in the direction of the light, it was still there, but seemed to be moving slowly.  My husband and I watched the light for several minutes as it seemed to drift away from us.  Before it disappeared from view, another light appeared from the same direction as the first one, and behaved in the same manner.  Before it too, drifted away, a third light appeared, again from the same direction.  There were three red-orange lights total.  All were at a low altitude, and all seemed to hover or move very slowly before simply vanishing. he night sky was clear last night so we are unsure how the lights simply disappeared from sight. My husband, nephew and I witnessed the lights.  Weâ€™ve never seen anything like this previously and we are not UFO afficionados. I mentioned the sighting to one of my brothers and he claims that he saw the same type of lights on July 4th weekend in Chautauqua Lake, New York.  He and his son saw four lights of the same description over the lake at around 10 p.m.;39.2131;-83.2763
