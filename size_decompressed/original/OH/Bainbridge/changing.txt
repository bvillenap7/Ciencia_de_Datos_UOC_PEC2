Upon looking at the object with binoculars I could see what appeared to be craft emitting a white/silver light with two thick black downward protruding pole and with a third pole that crossed at the bottom of the two downward poles but was extended further out to the port side. The body of the craft slowly and repeatedly cycled between the shape of a diamond and a circle during the entire time of the event. The body had well defined edges and I never had any visual obstruction or blurring caused by the light during it's shifting. It appeared to be at an extremely high altitude with a moderate velocity. Two other aircraft (airliners) were in the vicinity at the time but were well below it's altitude and they both had different headings. I immediately check online at website FlightAware.com which showed only the two scheduled airline flight already mentioned. This we! bsite doesn't show military flights. The objects approximate location was 39°13'58.22N  83°10'28.67W with a heading of approximately 100 degrees.  Altitude appeared to be in excess of 50k.  My point of observations would of been about 10-12 miles west of these coordinates.  The sky was clear and sunny, temperature was in the low 50's and the sun would of been to my back during the siting.;39.2131;-83.2763
