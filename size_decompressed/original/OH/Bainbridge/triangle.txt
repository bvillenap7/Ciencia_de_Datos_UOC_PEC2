Low-flying triangular object;1996-10-01 05:30:00;3 minutes;Low-flying triangular object (sorry, do not remeber exact date, but thought someone might be interested).  I was out walking my dog.  I looked up and saw an aircraft flying in a NW direction.  It was flying very low.  It appeared as though it were less than 200 feet off of the ground.  I noticed that it appeared to be triangular shaped and I thought it was trying to land somewhere, but there are no airports within 40 miles of us, and it appeared as though it were going to land in the next mile or so.  I watched it pass overhead and then I noticed there was no sound.  I picked up my dog and went in the house.  I heard nothing on the radio about plane crashes or any other strange sightings.  I lived near an area that has also recently had crop circles form.  Here is a link of some pictures and info of the 2003 crop circle.  http://www.cropcirclenews.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=168 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident may be approximate.
