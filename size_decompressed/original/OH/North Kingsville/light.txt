Red blinking light that looked like a shooting star.;2014-06-27 00:05:00;5 seconds;Red blinking light that looked like a shooting star It was a bright red!  And first I thought it was a shooting star!!  But it was blinking!!  Going fast across the sky!!  But then it made a complete circle and disappeared!  I mean it wasn't a helicopter or a plane going across the sky!  So weird.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.9032;-80.6799
