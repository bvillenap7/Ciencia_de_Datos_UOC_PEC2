Large orange shape shifting object over route 30 Crestline, OH.;2013-09-22 20:30:00;~2 minutes;Large orange shape shifting object over route 30 Crestline, OH. Driving west on route 30 in the evening. Noticed large orange shape in sky through the top part of my windshield, object heading south went over my head and lost it in tree line.  Moved past the trees about a 1/8th of a mile up. Pulled off the road and got out to watch object continue to move farther south slowly.  Shape of object appeared to be that of a jet completely engulfed in orange flames then seemed be a large burning meteor as I observed further.  Obviously it was neither, because it changed course to S/W direction while it also increased altitude.  Seconds later completely out of sight.;40.7961;-82.7352000000001
