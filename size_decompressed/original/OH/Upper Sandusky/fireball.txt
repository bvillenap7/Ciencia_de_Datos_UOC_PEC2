Remained stationary for 10-20 min. then started toward south and disappeared. Followed by 3 fast moving planes. Myself (Law enforcement/Corrections graduate), an RN, and retired individual were driving east on route 30 towards Upper Sandusky, Ohio at approximately 9:45 pm EST when I first noticed and pointed out to others an unmoving round orange light in the sky slightly NE of our position. Light remained stationary for several minutes (10-20) then moved rapidly across sky towards the south. Then it just dissapeared. Saw 3 planes (could tell by their flashing lights) follow along same path between 2-3 minutes after light dissapeared.;40.8212;-83.2975999999999
