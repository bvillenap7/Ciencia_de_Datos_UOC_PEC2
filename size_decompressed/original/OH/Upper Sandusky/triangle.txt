Slow Moving - Potential Triangular shaped aircraft;2012-06-13 23:00:00;6 minutes (approx.);Slow Moving - Potential Triangular shaped aircraft This is possibly a glider in the air.  This was suggested by my friend who at one point was pursuing a degree in aviation. It started about 11PM.  I was taking the trash out for our weekly pickup.  When I took the first trash bags out I noticed immediately to the north (orientation of our driveway) that there was an aircraft (almost looked higher, but could have maintained altitude) coming directly at me.   I could tell it was moving slow so I went back in and got my second load of trash bags, but this time I decided to wait to watch this thing fly over.  It had strobes that resembled a normal airplane, but had some other funky strobes.  The bottom of the craft was lit up and it was gray.   The aircraft had to be flying under 500Ft in altitude.  I can tell that it was lower than any prop airplane I have seen  in the area.  It took the craft about 30sec to fly the length of my property which isn't even 150yds in length.   The craft flew immediately overhead and made no sound.  I took a short movie as it was leaving the town, which turned out okay.  Nothing special, shows some strobes, but no other l! ights that I could see with the naked eye.  It took the plane another 4min (approx) to fly out of site.  I noticed it turned to the east for a split second, then back south, and then it appeared the lights just stopped.   I will double check in the AM once there is daylight with my angle that I was standing at that it couldn't have gone behind a building.  I'm a confident that it did not go behind anything however.
