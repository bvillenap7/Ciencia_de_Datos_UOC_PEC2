It was a bright elongated light moving approx.  60 mph At approximately 7 pm I was walking my dog and saw a huge white light approaching from the west.  My neighbor also saw it & began calling for his wife.  At this time I ran into my house to get my husband and we watched as it passed outside our kitchen window and dissapeared past the horizon in the west.  It was huge, as large as an ocean liner and moving at least 60mph.  This was the same night as the Leonoid meteor showers, but this was NOT a meteor!  Alot of other people in Ohio, Michigan and Kentucky also saw this object.  Those who did see it have said it was definately not a meteor or satillite.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
Larger orange light emitting smaller orange lights;2005-03-17 21:00:00;10 minutes;Larger orange light emitting smaller orange lights On Thursday night, March 17, 2005, around 9pm I was driving south on US Rt 772, about 5 miles south of Chillicothe when to my right (in the Western sky) I saw what appeared to be an orange light that spit out another smaller orange light that fell and the first orange light went out.  I thought it might be someone setting off some kind of fireworks as it was very low, just above the tree line.  I tried to watch to see if anything else appeared, but trees and hills got in my way.  Approximately 10 minutes later I pulled into my drive way and saw more lights in the western sky.  Twice in about 10-30 second intervals there appeared to be an orange light with 2-3 smaller orange lights emitting from them then they would disappear.  As I got out of my car I could hear a very loud airplane, but didnt see one.  I know that sometimes in our area the military practices night manuvers with some kind of tracer lights, but I have never seen them before, so I dont know if this is what I saw or not.  For the past 3 nights I have heard very loud airplanes.  They sound larger and slower moving than the jets we see during the day.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
Lights in the east sky with very strange flight patterns;2005-03-21 20:20:00;30 min plus;Lights in the east sky with very strange flight patterns In the east sky my father spotted a craft and could make out lights only.  The UFO seems to be very high in the sky.  The flight pattern of the UFO was very erratic.  I live 30 miles from my father and could make it out as well as he could.  He said that when he first spotted the UFO he noticed an unusual amount of military jets and helicopters in the area.  He said it sounded like a war zone.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
Lights with 'projectiles' west of Chillicothe, Ohio.;2007-09-12 22:30:00;15 min;Lights with 'projectiles' west of Chillicothe, Ohio. At around 10:30 yesterday evening I observed odd lights low in the sky west of Chillicothe Ohio.  I first noticed a slowly flashing while light, dimmer than the surrounding stars.  The flash was at a much slower pace than a typical aircraft warning light, perhaps three seconds between flashes.  After a few minutes, two more of these slow flashers appeared.  The sky was clear, so it shouldn't be assumed that they arrived under cloud cover. They began to move south at a slow rate of speed.  Suddenly, the top-most light emitted a bright red 'projectile' of some sort that sped out in front of it, growing dimmer as it went until is seemed to extinguish.  The other two light began to emit these projectiles, one every 20 seconds or so. After roughly 15 minutes, the lights simply went out, not far from where the event began.  I waited for another 15 minutes, but the lights did not return.  I've witnessed similar lights on two occasions in the past two weeks.  The events last no longer than 15 minutes and I've yet to see the lights entering or exiting the area where the lights are firing the red projectiles. Could someone contact Wright Patterson AFB to see if this might be a training exercise?  I couldn't find a number for them that would allow me to speak to someone who could clarify.  The red lights traveled in a straight path out from the lights, so it didn't seem like any flares that I've seen before.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
Strange aerial lights on Route 550 in Chillicothe Ohio.;2007-09-13 21:30:00;30 sec;Strange aerial lights on Route 550 in Chillicothe Ohio. The incident actually occurred over a year ago but the memory of what happened has remained in my mind as if it took place yesterday. I was driving to pick up my children at their day care providers home after getting out of a late night class at OU-Chillicothe.  It was around 9:30 p.m. September 13-19, 2007, (unfortunately, I’m not quite sure of the actual day anymore.)  I was on County Road 550, after going through Pleasant Valley.    Shortly after going past a school, the area opens up to a large corn field on the left.  It was at this area that I first noticed muted “lights” at the very top of my driver side door window. The day care provider lives in the country, and at that time of year, it was completely dark-- so I am unable to determine the shape of the “craft”.  However, these lights were amber in color and were clustered in, what seemed to me, two different V-shaped formations one set of three lights were slightly lower than the other set and angled somewhat differently.  It’s rather difficult to express in writing the pattern in which I saw the lights but after watching it for about 10 seconds, the lights started, to the best of my guess, splitting off and the two sets of lights became three.  I don’t recall any movement other than the lights transforming, (in other words, I don’t believe the craft(s) was traveling as much as it/they was just hovering and changing shape.)  I eventually lost sight of the lights in the trees as I went around a curve.  I actually slowed the car down and contemplated pulling over into the drive way of a little camp ground but thought better of it.  The whole thing, while it seemed to carry on longer, really only lasted about 30 seconds. Now, I’m not going to assume that I know what these lights are but I will state this… my mental health is sound and what I witnessed was NOTHING I have ever seen before.  No one will convince me that this was an air plane, (there were no blinking lights as you would see on a plane and while it appeared to be flying low to the ground, there was no noise.  Additionally, at this altitude, had it been a plane it would have flown over the car and out of sight quickly.)   Furthermore, I don’t believe it to be any sort of “government experiment” as I’ve actually seen similar lights, in the same formation, on an amateur video taken outside of the U.S. I realize that this has been some time ago, but I think about it almost daily.  (The experience was just too commanding not to.)   I know that there are real risks to admitting seeing something like this, (most people would call me “crazy” if they knew,) but it is my hope that someone else may be able to write a comment if they saw the same thing that night in the same area.  I know that there were other witnesses-- I recall looking into the rear view mirror at one point to see a motorcycle directly behind me and another car or truck behind the motorcycle.  I contemplated calling the city police or local radio but was concerned that they would not take me seriously, (and living in a small town, everyone knows everyone else, I just couldn’t take the risk.… my father is a doctor in the area… I plan to open my own business here shortly… etc., etc., etc.)  Anyway, any information or witnesses would be greatly appreciated. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
