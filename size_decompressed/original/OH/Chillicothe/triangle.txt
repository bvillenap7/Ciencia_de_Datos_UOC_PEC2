Amber colored lights in triangle pattern with smaller light in center.;2015-08-18 22:00:00;10 seconds;Amber colored lights in triangle pattern with smaller light in center. We were parked at a church to make a phone call when I looked out the window to my right, and saw three amber colored lights in a triangle with a slightly smaller center light.  They were very bright and just above the distant tree line. It seemed to be hovering in place.  The object was already there when I noticed it and observed it for about ten seconds when the lights dimmed and disappeared.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
Crazy lights in the sky.;2017-02-15 19:50:00;3;crazy lights in the sky I was on SR 50 heading west in between Chillicothe and Hillsboro at 7:50 pm today (2/15/2017) and we spotted a U.F.O.(s)  We were driving along when I saw 3 lights in a row spaced evenly straight ahead of us.  They were way larger than any star I’ve seen. Maybe the size of a quarter held out at arm's length.  Another set of 3 lights then appeared relatively close by those (roughly a 12 inch ruler held at arm length away from the first).  The first set of lights then turned off one at a time then came back on in a diagonal slant then they went back to horizontal.  Once this happened a bunch of lights appeared that was the same color but roughly 1/4 the size of the 3 in a row ones and flashing randomly.  Honestly it almost seemed like they were coming from the larger lights.  The larger lights then began to blink on then of one at a time again and the smaller lights went farther away until I couldn’t see them anymore.  The larger lights turned off or disappeared at the same time too I watched them get farther and farther away.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
