luminous oval spotted, low in sky;2006-09-21 21:00:00;5 seconds;luminous oval spotted, low in sky While travelling state route 159 south, about an hour after dusk, my wife and I both saw a football shaped object with approximately the same luminosity of a full moon. It was not brightly lit, but more luminous a yellow/brown hue. We both spotted this object for a few seconds before it dimmed and then disappeared as quickly as it appeared. As I was driving, my wife was better able to focus on the object. She reports that she could see the outline of the object briefly after the light dimmed.  The object was oval, almost football shaped. I could not really judge the height, but it seemed much lower than any commercial aircraft in the area, maybe a couple thousand feet. It was static in the sky. No movement was detected, and no sound was heard. This did not appear to be aircraft, and definitely did not appear to be a gas filled balloon. The shape, position and luminesence remained static until it quickly faded before disappearing.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
