4 large orange/white lights in a perfect line faded out and back on one at a time.;2014-10-23 20:30:00;2 minutes;4 large orange/white lights in a perfect line faded out and back on one at a time. While driving I saw 4 orange/white lights in a perfectly straight line. I thought I saw a cigar shaped shadow behind them as if it was one large object, but I can't be sure. I thought a large, low flying, jumbo jet must be headed straight toward me and about to crash land. It was frightening at first,  but then it seemed to change directions and gain altitude.  At the same time as it changed directions each light slowly faded out one at a time.  They even seemed to flicker just a bit as if burning out.  As soon as they all disappeared they flickered back on again slowly and one at a time and in a new position (consistent with an object that would be moving).  Also there was a direction change again as they were coming back on one at a time.  I was driving so I was not able to continually watch as much as I would have liked to, therefore I only saw them fade out one more time â€“ again one at a time, and as if they burnt out, not instantly on or off. The lights never once broke a perfect line formation, so if it was not a single object, it was an impossibly accurate formation of 4. This object (if it was one object) was either large and low flying, or REALLY large if it was far away. Hard to tell the perspective at night, but the lights were fairly large, round shaped and seemed almost like balls of light.
