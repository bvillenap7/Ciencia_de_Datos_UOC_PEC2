Object changed colors and shapes, divided  at one point ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2003-11-18 22:00:00;3 hrs;((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the twinkling star, Sirius, was the cause of the sighting.  PD)) Object changed colors and shapes, divided  at one point On November 18th ,2003  my husband came in and told me there was a strange object in the sky. My husband , I and the neighbor went out to watch it. The object started out as being triangular. We looked with binoculars and it appeared to be changing colors. It had red,green and blue lights. It was glowin.g a white color also. It would shine a beam of light , and then it would stop. As we watched it would change shape , at one point it appeared to divide  in half. We got out out telescope and tried to get a better look. We could see nothing with the telescope. It was as if we had a cap on the end , it was total darkness. We took pictures , and not a piture turned out. They were all black. We watched it from 10 pm to 1 am .When we finally went in the house it was still there. After going into out house we had a strange message on our answering machine which was sounds like echos. My computer would not work also. The neighbor called complaining her computer would not work also. I posted this on out town website , it seems some others saw it too. I called the sheriffs department to report it during the time we were seeing it. They said they were sending  someone out to look. After I called , we saw  alot of planes in the area of the craft. The sheriff said they had  no other reports when I called . A few people people I had talked to say they called also. They was no reports in our newspaper about the incident.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
Uncle and nephew have encounter with strange entity from glowing globe.;2004-12-21 08:00:00;1 hour +;Uncle and nephew have encounter with strange entity from glowing globe. I am a 43 yr old male, from ross co. ohio.  I was  walking with ny nephew when we saw a bright light in the sky near our home.  It was following the hill that was located behind our house,then stopped and began to hover over a field on the hill.   We walked to the area carrying flashlights to find our way through the woods.  When we got to the field, we saw tht the light was above the treeline on the other side, and was fairly large.  We signalled the light with our flashlights and to our amazement, the light reacted by flashing, then changing shapes (pyramid,star,square-as if it was some kind of laser-light show).  Then it returned to its circular shape and began to glow in a purple light, until the whole field was glowing purple also.  We noticed what appeared to be some kind of entities coming out of the top of the globe, and they were gesturing at us with their arms. Then one came out of the globe completly and floated down until it stood in front of us.  It was shaped like a human, but was made completely of the purple light-like a hologram-and had no facial features, fingers on its hands, and wore a long robe.  We tried to communicate with it to no avail, so I reached out my hand in a friendly gesture, and the being reached its hand out and put it on mine.  I felt no pressure on my hand, no feeling of a presence at all.  We then noticed these four red blinking lights appear around the field, surrounding the field on each side.  One moved to the large  glowing purple globe then back to its position.  I had glanced up to see these lights and when I looked back at the being in front of me it was gone.  Apparently I had a lapse of memory once I touched the creatures hand, because I learned later from my nephew that the entity had floated back to the globe once the red light moved out of its position. I do not remember this happening.  Once the being of purple light was gone we began to get very cold, and got a strange feeling of paranoia, like there was something else in the filed with us that we could not see.  So we went home rather quickly at this point. We found our dog hiding in the woods, it had ran off when the being floated down from the globe.  I reported this  incident to MUFON, who sent mr hartinger from RUFOS and two other guys, to interview us.  This incident was also published in the MUFON journal.  Has anyone else ever had contact with this type of entity? Ive heard of the greys,blues,greens, but purple light???;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998

My cell phone photographed multiple images of UFOs with no human intervention;2018-08-09 14:00:00;30 minutes;My cell phone photographed multiple images of UFOs with no human intervention On the afternoon of 8/9/18, I was working outside on my farm listening to music on my LG cell phone.  I had problems keeping the volume stable on my phone and received static when trying to use my bluetooth speaker.  I gave up trying to listen to music and placed my cell phone on a plastic chair in the shade of a tree next to where I was working.  I did not hear or see anything unusual on that day. Nearly a week later, 8/15/2018, while at lunch at work I discovered nearly 400 photos which I did not take and at first glance all appeared identical.  The photos were taken from 14:00 to 14:30, and at closer look show a reflective object which remains stationary in the sky yet changing in appearance - perhaps rotating.  The object appears for nearly 23 minutes in the photos.  There are other photos that show a single light orb and a photo that appears to be 3 orbs in a formation.  I am a 50-something, married mother of 3 adult children and a full-time registered nurse.  I did not take any of the photos from 14:00 to 14:30 on the 9th of August.  I am anxious to receive answers as to how my cell phone captured the ufo without human intervention and an explanation for the object that appears in the photos.  I have spoken by phone with Mr. Davenport and have emailed him 3 of the hundreds of photos.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
