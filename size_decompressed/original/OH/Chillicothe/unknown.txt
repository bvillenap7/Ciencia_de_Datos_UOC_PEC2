They went from one side of the sky to another side. Then they would go away and then come back.  From where I was they was many miles away because I just barly seen them.  I brought out a camrea and they did not even pick up on it.  They went from the southwest to south to southeast.  I do know that in the area the lights was dashing around in about 80 miles south there was a atomic plant.  I stayed outside until I could no longer see them.

The sky was clear and my friend who is an avid ametuer astronomer was outside stargazing.  He came running in the house to say I needed to go outside and see these strange lights in the sky.  There were 4 lights they were traveling extremely fast.  It seemed as though they were as high as the helicopter/planes that were flying were.  They went way to far in any direction to be r/c quadcopters and performed maneuvers that were way past the capabilities of normal planes or helicopters.  The flew out of our frame of vision 3 times and then came back into it we had a pretty unobstructed view for miles in any direction.  The lights they emitted were really faint and were hard to see if another light source was present. Immediately following the ufos  There were aircraft flying in what appeared to be a grid pattern in the area.  They were super silent aircraft and we! re flying an obvious grid pattern one coming in a minute or so after other was out of sight.  I am an avid drone / quadcopter enthusiast and there is no way thats what these were they were flying way to close in way to erratic of a nature to be quadcopters and not hit one another.  They reminded me of fireflies playing with each other, except at 30,000 feet.  The lights were to faint for my cell phone which is all i had on me to get the objects, but I did get video of the flashing lights of the aircraft that moved in afterwards.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
((HOAX))  12 aircraft in dogfight firing missles and tracer rounds with laser guidance near Chillicothe, Ohio.;2015-11-20 18:45:00;20 minutes;12 aircraft in dogfight firing missles and tracer rounds with laser guidance near Chillicothe Ohio Appeared to be a dogfight in the sky just to the west of Chillicothe.  At least 6 rockets were fired, bullets with tracer rounds were fired. Green laser beams also used, possible guidance weapons system.  There were small bright white lights that flashed and moved very fast in unorganized patterns appearing to chase other aircraft.  Could hear jet engines when there were only 2 aircraft left.  Battle lasted 20 minutes. Chillicothe, Ohio, is pretty far from our country's borders for another country to attack us.  Unsure of actual aircraft but there were definite jet engine sounds.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
Lights in a row in the sky the tons appered out of no where all bliking;2017-02-15 19:50:00;5 minutes;lights in a row in the sky the tons appered out of no where all bliking My wife, seven-year-old and I was on SR 50 heading west in between Chillicothe and Hillsboro at 7:50 pm today (2/15/2017), and we spotted a U.F.O.(s)   We were driving along, when I saw 3 lights in a row spaced evenly straight ahead of us.  The lights were a dimmer yellowish color (not a super bright white light that you would hear about).  I can’t really figure out how to explain the size.  They were way larger than any star I’ve seen.  Maybe the size of a half dollar held out at arm's length.  Another set of 3 lights then appeared relatively close by those (roughly a 12-inch ruler held at arm's length away from the first).  The first set of lights then turned off one at a time then came back on in a diagonal slant then they went back to horizontal.  Once this happened a bunch of lights appeared that was the same color but roughly 1/4 the size of the 3 in a row ones and flashing randomly. Honestly it almost seemed like they were coming from the larger lights.  The larger l! ights then began to blink on then of one at a time again and the smaller lights went farther away until I couldn’t see them anymore.  The larger lights turned off or disappeared at the same time too I but did not seem to recede.  This sighting altogether lasted about 90 seconds to two minutes.   I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that I’ve witnessed something unexplainable.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
