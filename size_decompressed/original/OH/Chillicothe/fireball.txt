Bright green light streaks twice in Ohio sky between Waverly and Chillicothe on clear night.;2003-10-21 21:10:00;3 sec;Bright green light streaks twice in Ohio sky between Waverly and Chillicothe on clear night. While traveling south on US 23 between Chillicothe and Waverly, Ohio, and ascending Divide Hill, my son and I witnessed a brilliant green light that appeared in the sky and dropped from northwest to southeast before extinguishing. Immediately after it went out, the same event occurred which made this very unusual.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
Comet-like object that broke up and then dispersed in a large cloud.   ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.  PD));2004-08-31 21:10:00;20 minutes;Comet-like object that broke up and then dispersed in a large cloud. I thought that I was looking at a comet in the south-western sky.  It was a huge fireball very high up.  It kept it's shape for approximately ten minutes.  It then appeared to break up and the resulting cloud took a long time to disperse.  I called the local Sheriff's department to see if anyone else reported anything but, no one else had.  It really did look like something blew up, way up in the sky.

5-7 large orange spheres.;2007-09-13 21:15:00;30 seconds;5-7 large orange spheres. At approximately 21:15 I saw 5-7 large orange balls (fireballs?) in the southwestern part of the sky.  They appeared to be in formation, dispersed, then faded out of sight.  An aircraft of some kind (I could tell due to the blinking lights on the aircraft)remained in the area for a little while.

5 red orange fireball looking things;2007-11-16 19:00:00;10 minutes;I was driving and I looked up and saw 5 red orange fireball looking things in the southwest sky . They would light up and glow for like 30 sec's then go out for a minute. During that minute of no lights I could see quite a few normal looking jet plane lights around the area of the fireballs. The fireballs never dropped like flares they would just move with the planes. I have never seen anything quite like it.  Somebody on here write a similar report here is the link     http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58716.html   Please if anyone saw it or knows what it was I would love to know;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
Two bright lights were flying in the air moving inbetween one another.;2012-03-12 21:45:00;30 Seconds;Two bright lights were flying in the air moving inbetween one another. My sister and I were heading inside from going to the store and there were to fireball type of lights moving back and forth between each other and the light lit up the sky almost like a full moon.  They were both white.  Neither of us were under the influence of any hallucinogenic or any drug.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
Orange ball flew across western to Eastern sky until &quothovering&quot for a couple hours till it faded away;2020-07-15 03:45:00;05:00;Orange ball flew across western to Eastern sky until &quothovering&quot for a couple hours till it faded away Past couple weeks thought I was looking at the space station at night while working in my shop all night.  Tonight I walked out and seen it fly with great speed from western sky through the northern sky and settle in the Eastern southerly sky.  I sat outside recording it and observing with binoculars till it slowly faded away as if going further out of the atmosphere. Would like to know if it's something lik e a SpaceX lunch as I have seen it several nights and wouldn't be surprised if I see it again. Was under the impression it was space station untill it moved with great speeds.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
