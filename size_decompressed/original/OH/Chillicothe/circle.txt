Two orbs over Chillicothe, OH.;2014-07-04 22:45:00;5 minutes;Two orbs over Chillicothe Oh We were returning from Forth of July Fireworks when we spotted two orbs in the sky, southwest of our position.  The orbs were slightly different in color, one more yellow, the other more orange.   They circled around one another for several minutes, sometimes changing directions and becoming dimmer as time went on until they faded from view. They were in the sky too long to be part of any fireworks, moved too erratically for planes or iridium flares. The dimming of the lights gave the impression that they were moving away from us.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998

We heard others;2018-08-11 23:00:00;1 hour;Seen a small but large looking object in the sky that appeared to be multi color, round, but looked like a ball of mass.   We heard others from a distance say something about a meter shower, but this object just stayed in one place.  It seemed to dim and fade away, but then started to brighten back up to full color.  From the eye it looked a bright orange color, but in the video looks like a bright multi color.   And then something else happened and you can see it on the video but I really don't know how to explain it.  Like it blows up but then seems to come right back to shape..   Please have someone call me back and share this with cause its REALLY SOMETHING TO SEE!!  I promise this is no joke.  I have a few videos of this object and and there was 5 of us fishing and watching it.;39.3379999999998;-82.9859999999998
