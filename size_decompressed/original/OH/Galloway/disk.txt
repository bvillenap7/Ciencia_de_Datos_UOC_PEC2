Disc shaped object sitting on top orange pulsating ball of light, and flickering image of itself next to it.;2010-11-12 00:45:00;3 MINUTES;Disc shaped object sitting on top orange pulsating ball of light, and flickering image of itself next to it. Saw orange pulsating light  a few thousand feet in the sky behind the houses behind my home Galloway, Ohio about 12:45 am 11/12/10.  Videotaped with zoom lens video camera for about three minutes of and on. I just bought the camera the day before and wasn't use to operating it.  Was hard to keep object in focus very long.  Object was moving very slowly to the south east.  After a couple minutes the object started flickering or flashing a bright white light off to its right.  Once I saw it flashing I assumed it was a plane, until I watched the video on my big screen tv a few weeks later.  Also filmed an airplane that past no more than a few thousand feet in front of object which is also included in video. I could make out a disc or saucer shaped object sitting atop an orange ball of pulsating light, also a mirror image of itself flickering to the right of itself clearly in video.  Filed report with mufon but couldn't get video to upload.  Attempting to upload! video on this sight.;39.9366000000007;-83.1837999999992
