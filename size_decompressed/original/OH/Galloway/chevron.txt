The colors were rainbow burnt metal, Purple, Orange, Red, Blue, Green.  While observing the object a blinding light shone from underneath.  I felt someone watching me and then the craft flew over to my bedroom window about five feet from my face outside my window the craft flew up and then left so fast all I saw was a blur when it left. The next night I do believe I was abducted and experimented on.  I was left with a message.  I was told to tell the humankind to stop looking for the aliens and start watching for each other.
