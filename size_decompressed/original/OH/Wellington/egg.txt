This objected was about 500 yards off the ground traveling south to north and about the size of a small plane but no wings.   I could see the sun reflected off this as it went overhead very slow for about 5 min. as it turned to the north and got smaller it seemed to just fade into the sky well within plane site still.;41.1685;-82.2291
