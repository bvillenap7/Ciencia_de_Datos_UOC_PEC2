Two craft with three blinking white lights over Toronto, Ohio.;2018-06-03 01:00:00;90 seconds;Two craft with three blinking white lights over Toronto, Ohio. I was oiling the clasp on my dog run wire when I looked up to the Southwest Skies and saw three white lights in a row moving from south to North.  The three lights flashed on and off 3 times when I started yelling for someone to come out the house to take a look.  My sister-in-law Beth came out to the porch and looked exactly where I told her to look and she saw the last two times that the three lights Flash and then she noticed just above the route the other lights were on three other lights flashed twice.  It look to be two different crafts traveling in the same direction south to North.  Each Craft only had three white lights that blink off and on and disappeared after the fifth Flash.  They weren't marker lights like on an airplane they were white not red and green.  After the fifth Flash they disappeared and did not continue across the sky.;40.4733;-80.6325
