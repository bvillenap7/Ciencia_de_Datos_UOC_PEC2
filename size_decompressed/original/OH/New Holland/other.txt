kinda scared me.;2006-08-01 21:30:00;30 seconds;kinda scared me. sky was starlite and moonlite. heard what ithought was thunder rolling a couple of times, but no clouds. then about six large balls of light,sun colored came on in series to shape a triangle type formation. lasted a few seconds, then to the right a single ball the same color appeared, then shot out several more ball like lights in a straight line the same size. then they all went back to the first ball, then it dissappeared. saw this in the southern sky;39.5623;-83.2529
