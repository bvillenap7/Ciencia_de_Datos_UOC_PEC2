Vivid green and red lights coming from an ovject East of Jupiter;1999-11-30 00:30:00;1 hr. 15 min.;Vivid green and red lights coming from an ovject East of Jupiter Witnessed by two adults at around 00:30 for approximately an hour and 15 minutes on the morning of November 30.  Vivid green lights could be seen from the outside of the object with red lights in the center. We recorded the object on and off for approximately an hour using an 8mm comcorder with a 64x digital zoom.  We ended up with about a half hour of tape.  On the tape, the object  appeared to be circular in shape with the green lights coming from the outside and red lights coming from a dome in the center.  It appeared to move closer and then farther away, at times becoming indistinct on the tape at its closest.  Then, near the end of the tape, it seemed to take on a mushroom-like appearance and became white in color.  At around 02:00, it seemed to move from south to north.  I can send a copy of the aforementioned videotape. ((NUFORC Note--Upon receipt of this report, we first suspected a twinkling star as being the cause.  However, the objects reportedly were not visible on the following night, according to the source.));39.5623;-83.2529
