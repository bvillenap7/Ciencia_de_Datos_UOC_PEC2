I went outside on my patio in the basement to smoke a cigarette.  I noticed a bright light in the sky way on the left of me.  At that time, I assumed it was a plane or a star.  As I was smoking my cigarette about minutes later, I noticed the light object was moving fast side to side and up and down.  It was moving at a speed no plane or helicopter could handle.   I then ran upstairs got my camera and my mother to come look the object.  It was no plane or a star.  It was definitely an unidentified flying object emitting bright light and moving at unnatural speeds.  I captured about 5 minutes of film where the object was hovering at.  The first 5 seconds is the best film of the video.;40.578;-81.0775000000001
