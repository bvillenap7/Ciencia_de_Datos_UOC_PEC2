On my way to work, I noticed something in the sky to the south of my position. It was a shiney silver oval object a few thousand feet in the air, close enough that if it were a large plane I would be able to clearly make out wings, windows, etc. It had no wings, no windows, and was so shiney that the sun, to the east of me, was glinting off of it brilliantly. I slowed almost to a stop, and kept staring at it trying to figure out what it could be. It was stationary in the sky, making no sound that I could hear. After about 2 minutes, it just shot upwards out of sight. It disapeared so quickly, literally in the blink of an eye, that it confirmed to me that it could not have been an aircraft. I got out of my vehicle and searched the sky for it, but it was gone.;40.578;-81.0775000000001
