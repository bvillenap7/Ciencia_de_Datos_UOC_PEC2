Zigzags and corkscrews with dead stops and sharp turns;2012-02-03 01:45:00;5 min;Zigzags and corkscrews with dead stops and sharp turns My dog needed to go outside and I was observing  the tilted moon phase and moving red light caught my eye.   At first I thought it was a Cessna airplane because it was moving at about that speed and altitude (I'm used to seeing Cessna's fly around 2500 ft in our area), but the red light didn't blink so I watched it for a few seconds while it continued straight.  I didn't hear any engines, it was actually kind of eerily quiet.  As I tried to focus my eyes to try to tell what it was, I could tell that it was a shiny metallic object with the red light emanating out an angle from the center and up around the sides.  I couldn't see the exact shape of the craft but it was oblong, so it could have been cigar shaped or a dic. It was almost as if it knew I was watching it because it started making small zigzags,,, then it stopped dead still.   After a few seconds it move a short distance 90 degrees left and stopped again.  It then appeared to move away  (up) probably about 500ft then stopped.  From this position it would dart left to right as if it was letting me know what it was every few seconds.  A couple times it made zigzag and cork screw maneuvers within a small location returning to that spot.  Its speed during this entire time was fairly constant.  From my point of view I would guess that it held position and did the maneuvers  within  a 500 ft area around it. After about 5 minutes I decided to get my camera from the house but when I came back out it was gone.;40.6425999999999;-83.6151000000001
