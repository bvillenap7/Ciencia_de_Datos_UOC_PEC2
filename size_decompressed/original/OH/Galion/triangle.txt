Triangle Hovers over town for 6-8 minutes;2002-10-16 20:20:00;7-10 minutes;Triangle Hovers over town for 6-8 minutes At 8:20 i picked up my 2 children 4 miles east of Galion, ohio.  From that distance heading west I observed a large orange/yellow pulsating ball of light on the horizon (which is obscured by trees).  I continued to notice movement of the light slowly from 10 degrees in both directions moving left to right. By the time I entered Galion and stopped at the light in front of Police? firehouse (6-8Minutes) the object was hovering one block to the north. across the street form the Catholic school.  It was hovering in place for a good 45-60 seconds, no more thaqn 150-200 feet off the ground.   From one block away, and as low as it was, it simply appeared as a long rectangle with 3 bright white lights and one orange/yellow pulsating light as the second in the column on the rectangle (it was facing east).  I t began to undulate or wobble slightly and began moving slowly to the east ( im still sitting one block away at a light looking up and to the right).  When it crossed the street, perpencicular to the way i was facing (west), i turned north and traveled to the next block, turned to follow to the east, went over the overpass and by the time i reached the apex of the overpass, the object was at least 5-7 hundred in the air and from behind and underneath this rectangle from one block away and 150-200 feet off the ground was actually a triangle witht the 3 white lights at the points and the orange/yellow pulsating light was in the center.   There were very dim twilight columns of light on the underbelly of the craft.  There was no sound from this thing.  It was the length of the church which is over 200 feet long and had to be 150 feet wide.;40.72;-82.8038
