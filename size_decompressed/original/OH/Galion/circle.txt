As we were driving down the road we saw a lighted object... looked like two circles ontop of eachother with points at each corner with lights on the points.  This object was going fast, and just stopped.  From looking at it, it was so close to the ground it was prob the size of my palm.  id say if it was on the ground it was the same size as an airplane or bigger.   We immediately turned around  looking for it and it was just gone.  No clue where it went. The sky was clear and open.   This was the craziest thing ive seen and i cant stop thinking about it.  I really wish i would have got it on camera bc it was so clear.;40.72;-82.8038

Then when we used binaculars and it looked like a light white circle surrounded by a bright white circle.   I took a picture and when I zoomed in on the picture taken, it clearly shows 2 circles side by side surrounded by light.;40.72;-82.8038
