V shaped UFO over Ohio;2010-07-10 22:45:00;15 - 20 seconds;V shaped UFO over Ohio On the night of July 10, 2010, while spotting the glimmer of satellites as they orbited above, I noticed a ‘V’ shaped object in the sky, approaching from the southeast heading straight toward the northwest.  It had 8-10 dim orange/red lights.  It was also witnessed by two other people, and was visible for 15-20 seconds.   We had binoculars, and could easily see that it was in fact a single craft.  What shocked us most was that it made no noise whatsoever.  The size was hard to judge but if it was around the size of a commercial jet, I would judge its altitude to be around 3-4 thousand feet.   I will include a link that best describes what we saw, though we saw it at a much higher altitude. http://www.ufocasebook.com/2009/californiatrisightingnov2008.html;41.1416723320155;-81.4810207509877

Cuyahoga Falls Ohio 7/24/2012 21:45 We saw an object flying below the total overcast sky.  Craft was traveling from north to south.  Craft had 4 orange lighte one on each corner and one in the middle. The light in the center appeared like some kind of flame.  It was flying faster than a plane or helicopter and was silent.  It appears to be like the ones sighted in other areas.  I do not know the cloud celing but we could only see one star or planet at about 11 oclock overhead.;41.1416723320155;-81.4810207509877
