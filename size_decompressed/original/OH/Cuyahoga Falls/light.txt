Yellowish light in sky;2013-06-08 21:30:00;3 minutes;yellowish light in sky On June 8 2013 my wife, three children (12-18years),  I (police officer) and my neighbor, his wife and child (15) were sitting on my front porch talking.  My porch faces toward the West.   My wife was facing north.  She said look at those lights.  All of us then looked toward the north.  There were about 12 lights coming south and 3 trailing.  She said they came up out of the tree line and thought they were fireworks at first.  The lights traveled south then they turned and went west.  They went through a thin cloud and disappeared. We heard no rumble of an engine or propeller.  There was no sound from the formation at all.  I was able to get a few pics. but there are trailing lines in these lights because I could not hold camera still.;41.1416723320155;-81.4810207509877

Slow flashing light in northern sky towards Lake Erie.;2020-07-09 01:14:00;5 minutes;Slow flashing light in northern sky towards Lake Erie. Took the trash out around 1:10am, was about to get my telescope ready to view Saturn but noticed a light that was slowly flashing in the northern sky an amber to red color.  I watched it for a few minutes, noticed it was staying in the same position.  Called for my girlfriend, she came out, we tried to get video but by that point it started tracking East, still flashing but the lights were dimmer the further it was getting from us.  It was completely silent, no chon-trail.  Whole event lasted around 10 minutes.;41.1416723320155;-81.4810207509877
