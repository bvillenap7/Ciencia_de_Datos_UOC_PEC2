A dozen or more lights in a V formation moving quickly and silently.;2003-03-03 22:15:00;3 or 4 seconds;A dozen or more lights in a V formation moving quickly and silently. I was taking my dog out, and while I waited for him I was looking at the night sky.  It was clear at the moment and as I looked at the stars directly overhead I saw a V shaped formation of approximatly 12 to 15 lights traveling northwest. They were traveling very quickly, and silently, and in a few seconds were out of sight.  The individual lights though staying in formation seemed to flit around.  It made me think of a group of clear spheres flying in formation with a single firefly darting around in each one if you can imagine that.;41.1416723320155;-81.4810207509877
