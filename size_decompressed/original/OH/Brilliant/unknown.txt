Plane flying straight into space.;2016-09-08 01:20:00;30+;Plane flying straight into space. At 01:20 I observed a aircraft go over head after I had observed a military aircraft go overhead and lead at Pittsburgh Airport.  The second craft continued to claim into space for over 40 minutes at which time I finished observing.  Craft only had white lighting moved at a high speed but not much faster than most jets from my point of view.  But clearly continued to go farther out of atmosphere.  I see many jet take off and land at the two local airports this one never went over the horizon.  It only continued to gain altitude.;40.2689;-80.6341
