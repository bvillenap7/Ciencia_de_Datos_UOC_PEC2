I was with my husband who also saw the unusual craft.  We saw 3 red lighted craft that had a slow blink to them, which was unusual because most aircraft usually have a faster blink.  The 3 were heading North East and then a 4th joined them coming up from the South.  They were low in the sky ( a typical helicopter level that you might expect on a news chopper or police chopper) but they made no sound.  At first I thought they were helicopters but as they got closer I expected to hear sound and it never came.  Then when they were above me they headed east and a 4th joined them.  When they turned east their lights faded and disappeared and I could not see them.  The crafts I could not see only the lights. It was not totally dark outside, and I took video on my phone but I couldnâ€™t catch them on video.;40.1873;-82.9898999999998
