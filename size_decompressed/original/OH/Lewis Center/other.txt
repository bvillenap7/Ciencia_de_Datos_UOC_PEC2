Squid-shaped floating upwards with legs, almost looked liked a flying squid.;2018-03-12 03:30:00;30 seconds;Squid shapped floating upwards with legs, almost looked liked a flying squid. I was driving southbound on 23 to pick up my son who works at White Castle.  I glanced at the sky, and saw what appeared to be a giant squid type object that had legs dropping from it.  Like I said, it looked like a squid.  My hubby thinks it could have been a weather balloon. This occurred in between the hours of 3:30 pm - 4 pm.  I got across the street to wal-mart to see if i could photograph it, and could not locate it.  I need confirmation if anyone else perhaps saw this.  It was flying above the shopping center district,  North point in Powell, Ohio.  I'm positive that it was some type of weather balloon.  But, I want to make sure.  I am huge into everything paranormal including UFO'S.  Please confirm if this was indeed a weather balloon.  I've tried to google weather balloons, and nothing pulled up in our county.  I swear on a stack of bibles, I saw something squid-like going upwards into the sky, hence the reason that I searched for a weather balloon.;40.1873;-82.9898999999998
