Reddish orange lights hovering over a golf course craft shaped into a triangle.;2011-10-08 23:30:00;10 minutes;Reddish orange lights hovering over a golf course craft shaped into a triangle. So standing out side right... The triangle shaped craft hovered over Little Bear Golf course... then in ten minutes it disappeared.  I had to report this since I saw it.  I had the weirdest dream last nite after seeing it...  it felt like they saw me there and I talked to others and they too had these weird dreams.  I don't know how to explain it but I worry right now because it won't leave my mind alone. Its the lights that did I believe  the reddish orange lights.
