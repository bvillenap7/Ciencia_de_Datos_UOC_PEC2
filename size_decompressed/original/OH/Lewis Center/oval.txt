Mysterious oval in sky above all of the trees.  ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous.  Possible hoax??  PD));2006-09-07 08:50:00;1 minute;Mysterious oval in sky above all of the trees Me and my brother were watching the Steelers game that night and my frind was on his way over to our house to pick up his cell phone when on the way he saw a bright red oval just sitting over the trees it almost looked like it had flames or something coming coming off it.  About a minute later he ran over to our house and told me and my brother to hurry up and come out here.  When we went out the mysterious light was gone.  So me my brother and my friend were standing outside in the street talking about it.  About 2 minutes later this HUGE radar plane was hovering around the area. The radar plane was so low we could make out all the details on it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  Possible hoax??

Thinking at first was either a balloon or then based under the unusual movement of the object we were thinking drone. ((anonymous));2016-04-16 15:50:00;20 minutes;Thinking at first was either a balloon or then based under the unusual movement of the object we were thinking drone.  However the bright white object continued to go higher and higher and at a very high altitude that we both felt should of been impossible to still see that high up. very bright object possibly reflective off the sun for it was blue sky and sunny. object at first looked circular like a balloon but moved to where it went very flat over and over a few times. Commercial plane at that time was in its line of path however higher up then the object in question. this however is when we were very perplexed at what this object was for when this plane crossed it path though considerably higher from our stand point, this is when this object took off and went very high in the sky.  Trajectory was abnormal.  We also are unaware of how high a drone can go but after our research we are positive this object was 10x higher then the average commercial drone.
