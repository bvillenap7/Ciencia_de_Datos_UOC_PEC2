cone shape with lights;2003-08-25 00:30:00;0040am;cone shape with lights one cone shaped ufo.  I was on my way home from work and kept seeing something in the sky that wasn't moving as i got closer I stopped and watched it.  The car behind me had to stop also.  After watching I thought it was best to just leave it be. I drove down the road about a mile, then i decided to turn back around to take another look. As soon as I stopped the cone shaped object took off like a bat out of hell.  I never believed in ufos but i do now.  WOW, MOST AMAZING THING I HAVE EVER SAW.  taking my camera tonight to work;41.5798;-83.6660000000001
