Captured strange formation in sky on cellphone video, Maumee Oh;2012-03-02 19:30:00;15-20 mins;captured strange formation in sky on cellphone video, Maumee Oh I was taking my son out to get a bite to eat, and as we exited the front door of our apartment complex we both noticed these extremely bright stars or lights in the sky.  Along with them was a formation of other lights that seemed to be blinking in a sort of pattern or...I wanna say signals?   thats just what it seemed to me.  I was able to capture 10 seconds worth of video of it on my cellphone camera but the entire event for us went on for 15 mins of staring up in disbelief till we had to finally leave.  My son is 5, and even he thought it was highly strange.;41.5798;-83.6660000000001
It made a u-turn toward my direction, then it made a 90 degree turn to the North.;2014-07-05 16:00:00;10-15 seconds;My mom, dad, and I went out to Blue Grass Island to go Smallmouth Bass fishing in the Maumee River.   When we were done fishing, we began to try to find our way back to the area that we came onto the Island.   We begin to walk around the point of the island, I heard a plane, so I looked up and seen the plane.  Then I seen a small sphere type object.  It was flying slower than the plane that I seen.   It made a U-turn toward my direction, then it made a 90 degree turn to the North.   After that it vanished from my sight and I didn't see it again.;41.5798;-83.6660000000001
