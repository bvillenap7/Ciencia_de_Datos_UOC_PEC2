It continued across the sky and little pieces seemed to burn off and disappear.  The light disapated and continued all the way to the horizon and dissappeared beyond the tree line. It was not like other debris or meteors I have witnessed in the past because it lasted so long. It headed from west to east in the sky starting at about 11:00 position and ending finally at the 5:00 position behind the trees on the horizon.;41.5798;-83.6660000000001
