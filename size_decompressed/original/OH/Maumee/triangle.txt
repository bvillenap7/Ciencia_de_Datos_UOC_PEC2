Blue lights in a trianular shape southwest of Maumee, Ohio;2008-04-16 22:00:00;20 minutes;Blue lights in a trianular shape southwest of Maumee, Ohio We saw blue flashing lights to the southwest of Maumee, OH. It was pretty far away. It seemed to hover some and move to the left and right some. We also saw a red light separate from the blue that was smaller and dimmer, but stayed close to the blue lights. It was not always visible. We went up a block from home for better visibility with a telescope (not a high powered one). Thru the telescope we saw that there were actually three blue flashing lights on one craft shaped like a triangle. We could not make out the definite shape of the craft due to the distance. It must have been turning while it hovered because the lights were not always in the same position. We watched it for about ten minutes and went inside, checking on it every five minutes or so. By about 22:30 or 22:40, it had disappeared.;41.5798;-83.6660000000001
