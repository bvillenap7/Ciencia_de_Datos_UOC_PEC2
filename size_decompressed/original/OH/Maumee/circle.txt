there was a flashing ball of light moving in strange patterns and that hid from a plane.;2011-07-06 22:45:00;about an hour;there was a flashing ball of light moving in strange patterns and that hid from a plane. i was laying out in my front yard on a blanket, looking up at the stars. it was dark and there was little to no wind.  i happened to look over towards my backyard and i saw a blinking light.  i dismissed it as being clouds passing a star or fireworks or something since i never believed in anything out of this world.  i went on looking around then glanced back over and it had moved up a bit more. at this point i figured it was just a plane or a helicopter since we live near a hospital. i kept looking at it and noticed it moving in a strange pattern.  it moved down quickly, slowly drifted sideways, shot back up and just kept changing its movement.  i looked closer and it seemed to be a white light that was blinking blue and pink and green and would turn yellow once in a while.  i found this odd so i went inside and got my mother. she doesn't believe in anything paranormal what so ever, so i figured she may be able to give me a more rational explination.  she looked! at it and at first didn't see it moving since it was very small and far away.  after watching for a few moments, she said she had no clue what it could be. even my mother thought it was strange.  she tried to get her husband to go see it, but he refused. i began trying to call friends around maumee to see if they could see it as well. i wasn't sucessful. i posted about it multiple times on facebook  while i was watching it. suddenly, a plane was flying overhead.  the object drifted sideways, getting brighter, then shot down and disappeared, reappearing out of thin air once the plane was gone.  i was still doubtful until this happened. i continued to watch for a while and being freaked out but tired, i decided to go inside.  i went to see if it was still there an hour or two later and i was not able to locate it.;41.5798;-83.6660000000001
Two round flying objects one flashing, maumee Oh 7am.;2012-03-11 07:00:00;10 minutes;two round flying objects one flashing, maumee Oh 7am. I was exiting my apartment complex to check the mail approx. 7am.  I was having troubles sleeping all night so figured a quick breath of air would be pleasant.  Due to the time change for daylights savings it was still dark out.  As soon as I stepped out of the building, in the skyline ahead of me was a flashing very very fast orb.  It was at a distance in the sky and high up so the shape was unclear but if I didnt know better I would have mistaked it for an airplane, but its speed was just way too intense and the colors flashing were just strange and not at all of aircraft.   It passed over and a patch of trees blocked my vision. I ran out quickly to get a better look beyond them and it was gone.  I tried to ride it off and treked to the mailboxes.  Just out of paranoia, I looked up from there after retrieving my mail and cursed myself because again, I saw a strange distant orb/circle crossing amongst the stars.  It actually looked like a star, a dull gray orb not f! lashing like the other, but it was speeding along in the same manner.  It wasnt a shooting star because it didnt curve, it kept a steady streaming pace. Then as it passed by a very bright starlike object a tad bigger, it stopped, and moved BACKWARDS towards this star or whatever, and disappeared it seemed INTO it. Im not very savvy when it comes to aircraft, or astral phenomenon...but what object or projectile flys foreward...then suddenly puts it in reverse?  Im baffled, and in honesty sitting here with all the lights on after running into the house.  This is not my only abnormal circumstance after moving to Ohio since 1 year ago.;41.5798;-83.6660000000001
Bright white light floating across sky.  It did not blink and there was no noise.;2014-01-24 06:50:00;2 minutes;Bright white light floating across sky. It did not blink and there was no noise. Driving home from work this morning, I witnessed a bright white light in the sky above Fallen Timbers floating across 24 and towards the Maumee River where it flew out of sight.  The light in relation to where I viewed it from my car was low and about the size of a pencil eraser.   There was no noise, and it was definitely moving because I viewed it in a still car.;41.5798;-83.6660000000001
Distant dot of light crossed night sky from west to east in 5 or 6 seconds, too slow for meteor, far too fast for jet.;2014-04-22 21:30:00;5-6 seconds;Distant dot of light crossed night sky from west to east in 5 or 6 seconds, too slow for meteor, far too fast for jet. On about April 22, 2014, at about 21:30 in Maumee, Ohio, I witnessed a very small white dot in the night sky, consistent with a jet at high altitude and about the same brightness.  The light moved across the sky from west to east in about 5 or 6 seconds, moving much faster than any aircraft but also much slower than any meteor I have seen.
