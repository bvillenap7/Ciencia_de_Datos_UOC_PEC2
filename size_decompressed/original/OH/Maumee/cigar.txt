I was going outside to take out the garbage and saw that it was a very clear night so i deceded to look at the stars. I was looking up and noticed an object with no lights on moving. It caught my eye since plains usually have lights on at night. So I was watching it move. It didnt move like a normal plain it was moving side to side with eas. Then out of no were it made a bright flash looking like a star and it was gone.;41.5798;-83.6660000000001
