Red-orange lights over Ohio 18 / State Road.;2013-02-16 20:00:00;5 minutes;red-orange lights over Ohio 18 / State Road Driving along State Road heading towards Route 18 from Medina area, several orange-red lights (almost sodium lamp in color) were spotted off of the left hand side of the road.  They were traveling slowly in a south-easterly direction, at approximately twice the altitude of the nearby water tower.  No sound was heard in association with lights.  After the first group of 5 or 6 lights passed overhead, two more followed, and then a final light behind those.  All seemed to be moving the same speed (15-20mph) and direction.  Sky was slightly cloudy from snow, so shape of any attached craft was un-discernible.  Leading 5 lights were shaped like an exponential function (curving upwards concavely), trailing lights had no notable geometry.  The lights did not flash but remained steady through the sighting.;41.1526;-81.63
