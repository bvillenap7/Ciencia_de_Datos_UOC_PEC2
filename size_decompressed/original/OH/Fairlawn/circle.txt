Orange balls in line moving slowly north to south;2014-10-11 21:30:00;5 minutes;Orange balls in line moving slowly north to south My son first noticed the lights.  He thought they were stars in a row.  I noticed they were moving slowly. 5 orange balls, all in a line, moving slowly from north to south.   Then a 6th ball came up and got in line.  They went higher until they just flickered out.   We thought they may have been lanterns drifting up but these were too high, too uniform.   All the same distance apart, moving in the same direction at the same speed.;41.1526;-81.63
