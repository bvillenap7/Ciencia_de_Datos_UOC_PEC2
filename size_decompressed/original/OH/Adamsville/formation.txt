Spread across full view of horizon moving very slow, no noise noticed, towards a large purple cloud on horizon. Objects first spotted while driving.  Seen first 2 objects for approx. 10 miles before realizing the slowness as odd along state route 93 coming from Otsego towards Adamsville Ohio. Pulled over roadside to take pictures, at this time we observed 5 clearly visible objects possible 6th. Watched for another 10/15 minutes. Objects were still on horizon almost out of sight when we returned to vehicle and headed on.   Examined photos this evening and seen very odd crazy looking sphere in front of sun that we did not notice by eye. Those photos were taken approx. 25 miles north and about an hour before.  Pictures were to just be of a pretty sky.  We thought it was a blemish in photo, examination of 2 photos taken at a 45 degree angle from one another show symmetrical sphere and the reflection of it is visible in the water.;40.0771;-81.8754

5 identicle slow moving large disks took 20 minutes to drift across sky;2005-02-01 17:40:00;15 min+;5 identicle slow moving large disks took 20 minutes to drift across sky i observed 5 objects flying very slowly across the sky. at first i believed them to be airplains with very short vaper trails. then realized that explination didn't make sence because a plane would move faster then that and create a longer vapor trail with no dispursement of vapor. they seemed to be flying in a pattern, all going the same way, however the pattern seemed to wide for normal airplain pattern. Objects were to far apart. Also, if there were 5 planes in the air that close there should have been some noise, there was no sound. Late afternoon, clear sky, watched for 15 to 25 minutes.;40.0771;-81.8754
