Triangle was longer on two sides (not equilateral). I saw it from a distance, and it looked like the top of a radio tower or something.  It was late afternoon, and we were driving down a long, straight back road next to a field, so visibility was far and the sun had not set yet.  I was in the back seat, looking out the left window, and the object was in the air a few thousand feet up at about 10 o'clock high. As we got closer to it, the other kids noticed it, and we pulled over the car and started piling out.  By the time all 6 of us had piled out of the sedan, it was moving.  It accelerated in a straight line away in the direction that we had been driving, and was gone in the distance in maybe 5 seconds.  I never heard a sound.  One of the other kids claimed to have heard a low hum. The most interesting thing about how it had initially hovered is that it was not moving at all.  Not bobbing, not leaning from the wind.  It was steady enough to cause me to think it was the top of a tower initially. Then, when it accelerated away, it was in a perfect, straight line.  Ohio is notoriously windy, and that day was no exception - yet the object was floating very, very steadily, without any deviation whatsoever.
