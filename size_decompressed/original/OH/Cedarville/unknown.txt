Large stationary aerial object hovering in the night sky;2010-10-15 21:15:00;2-3 Mins;Large stationary aerial object hovering in the night sky Traveling east on U.S. 42 going toward S. Charleston on a Friday night I observed a very large object about somewhere around 30 to 35 degrees above the horizon of indeterminate shape but having many lights hovering and stationary directly to my right.  AS I was driving I attempted to keep it in sight for a few minutes and passed a car pulled over onto the berm  with all of its lights off.  The reason I am sure it was not a star or other celestial object is it was suddenly gone.  Not having anywhere to pull over on my side of the road I couldn't stop and look toward that general area to observe if had moved into a new position.  This is the second time in four and one-half years that I have seen something in this general area and reported the other encounter for April 2006 on this website.  Later I wondered if the people in the other car had stopped and were watching the same object.  For some reason that didn't cross my mind at the time!;39.7465;-83.7997999999999
