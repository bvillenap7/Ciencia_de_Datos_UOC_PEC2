My boyfriend and I were driving to go pick up pizza around 9PM. We spotted three orange orbs, they were not moving or blinking, in a row, almost like a triangle formation. Then first the middle one disappeared and then one after another. It was also a Super Moon that night . They were close to the moon in my perspective of the sky.;39.7465;-83.7997999999999
