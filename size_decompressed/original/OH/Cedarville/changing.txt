Cigar Craft with Portholes or Lights;2006-04-15 21:30:00;1-2 minutes;Cigar Craft with Portholes or Lights Returning from Wilberforce, Ohio, on the road home after a night class my attention was drawn to a very bright star to my left easily visible through the windshield.  What seemed like incredible speed, the light came down and became an elongated craft with visible lights or portholes all down the side I could see as it passed me in a split second.  Being a warm night, I had rolled down my window to watch it when I realized it was dropping down to level off in the field paralleling the Highway on my left.  I was trying to find a place to pull over wide enough to safely get off the Highway.  All the while I was attempting to keep the craft in sight as it passed me, went back into the sky quickly and again became a very bright star visible and hanging over the area of Cedarville about 4 or 5 miles behind me.  Within a minute I found a wide spot and pulled over, got out and noticed across the road and east there was farm with lots of cars parked along the highway and in their driveways as if there was some kind of gathering or meeting.  I would think if anyone was looking out the widow they would have witnessed this same event.  I have been through that area hundreds of times since and think about the incident nearly every time.  The OH ANG base and Wright Pat are not that far distant from this location.  In addition I would add there was absolutely no sound.  That much I am sure of though this is the most baffling of experiences and cannot be explained in any natural way! ((NUFORC Note:  The date indicated by the source of the report is flawed.
