I am not going to call these sightings any more.  Somehow, the bruising around my ribs and thighs are telling me this was more of a visit.  I was about ready for bed, letting my dog dudley out for an evening walk.  He began barking and used his tail to cover his genitals in fear as he cowered behind me.  I suddenly felt what I would describe as an extreme static charge in the air that seemed to cause droplets of dew to quickly evaporate.  Even the frost on the ground turned to steam and I could feel intense heat.  This quickly turned my attention towards the treeline in front of me as I heard the same high pitch sound, only this time much more painful.  I dropped to my knees and noticed blood dripping from my nose onto the ground.  This came to a sudden stop as a warm intense blue / gray light surround my body and seemed to have a heavy weight on my back, pushing me to my stomach and making my face lie in the blood from my nose.  I woke up shivering and nude in my bed nearly six hours later.  Dudley seems to be very scared and barking all day.  He wont eat and wont let me touch him.  I feel the same emotions of isolation.  I need to talk about this and I am afraid to tell anyone I know.  My nose has scratches on the inside and is very tender and I have had strong migrains all day.  Last night, I do remember having thoughts almost as is someone was telling me what was happening.  My thoughts were saying...It's ok, we are scientists, you will feel pain shortly, think of it as a study.  500 Lights On Object0: Yes;39.8626;-84.7837
