Rectangle, bright white on bottom with small flashing red and green on sides, no wings;2015-10-11 00:00:00;5 minutes;Rectangle, bright white on bottom with small flashing red and green on sides, no wings My daughter (19 years old) and I (45 years old) were driving on I-70 West from Columbus, heading toward I-675 South around midnight on October 10, 2015. The sky was very dark, with little cloud and very bright stars. We were close to Springfield, Ohio when I noticed a very large bright flashing white light with a small flashing red light on one side, and a small flashing green light on the other. Because of the flashing side lights, I initially thought it was an airplane, and it was just extra bright against the dark sky.  But as we got closer to it, the white light was bigger, and it appeared that the light was hovering in place, not moving. I then thought maybe it was a warning light attached to a tower, as there are many along I-70 West, although the warning lights are typically all white or all red. As we drove by it, it was not over the highway, but off to the side over the trees and fields.  I was able to see it briefly because I was driving.  I looked up at it and could see underneath. It was not attached to a tower, but was a rectangle shape that seemed to be standing still in the sky.  It did not have the body shape of an airplane and there were no wings.  The bulk of the underneath was the white light, and the two smaller lights were on either side. I could hardly believe what I saw, but there was no safe place to pull over so I kept driving and my daughter watched behind as we drove away from it.  It did not appear to move to her, and she did not see wings or a tower either.  She continued to watch it, until my driving caused her to lose sight of it.;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756
