Fireball broke into 3 parts. changed colors to blue, green, then red the orsnge like embers decreasing in brightness while changing color. dissappearing in the easten horizon. While eastbound on state route 4 noticed a bright fireball coming from the west heading east. The fireball was white in color, then I noticed in seemed to break into 3 separate, and smaller pieces. The 3 pcs where moving almost in a row. I noticed that the objects where bright enough to make the vehicles in front of me to cast slight shadows. The objects changed color quickly to blue , then yellow, green, then red, finally orange amber. As the colors changed, the brightness dimmed respectively.  By the time the objects turned amber, and dim They disappeared over the eastern horizon.about 10 degrees south. I was 4 miles from home at this time. My home co-ords are: 39deg 55'28N, 83deg 49'31W. When I first noticed the single object, it was appx 60 deg from north horz. and 90 west(exact middle of sky east to west). About 5 seconds later it divided into 3 then, it took about 50 seconds or so untill they disappeared from my view. I don't do drugs, and had not been drinking. I'm a quality engineer by profession. Have been an amateur astronomer since childhood. Have NEVER seen anything like this before. At first I thought it was a meteor, but knowing Leonids comes from almost the opposite direction, I think this might have been space junk. This event was similar to fireworks. It appeared  to be losing altitude, thought it was going to crash at first. It would be interesting to find-out what this is.;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756

Floating fireball seen in Springfield, Ohio or Chinese Lantern?;2012-05-26 23:40:00;2 mins;Floating fireball seen in Springfield, Ohio or Chinese Lantern? Saw fireball towards Southeast while pasenger in car driving east on Home Rd. It seemed to be stationary at first and I could see it at intervals through tops of trees. While aproaching intersection of Route 4 it was directly overhead. We turned towards the south on Route 4 and stopped the car about a 100-125 yards from intersection in front of a cemetary. We got out of car and I told my brother who was driving to get his camera phone out.  I looked back towards the North to see it and it was gone.  Then my brother said look their is a second one. It looked identical, shaped like a lightbulb, and was towards the south-southeast over the cemetary. It seemed to float somewhat stationary above the cemetary for about a minute then slowly traveled in an eratic floating type manner directly above us and then towards the North.  We watched it for about 2 minutes. My brother who was driving wanted to leave before it was out of sight because he had a head light out on t! he car.  So, we drove to my house about 2 minutes away and got in my car to see if we could find it again.  We drove back to the sight and continued North on Route 4 for about 5 miles and did not see it anymore. It apeared to both of us like one of those Chinese Lanterns that others have seen as well.  So, was it a Chinese Lantern? Was there actually one or two of them, I'm not sure.  There was no sound from the object.  My brother did capture it from his phone but it is not very clear and only lasts a few seconds.;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756
Fireballs over Springfield Ohio.;2013-01-10 22:00:00;30 minutes;Fireballs over Springfield Ohio At 2200, my shift partner and I along with another co-worker and his wife at an EMS company had seen seven “fireball” type UFOS that were flying over Springfield, Ohio. These “fireballs” at first were thought to be helicopters, then planes. They did not make any type of audible noise, no lights that flashed, or any other type of identifying marker.   These “fireball” craft orange in color would fly coming from the SE heading NW below the cloud cover, how-ever the first one and the last one of these seven would head North.  These aircraft would fly in their respective directions then disappear out of sight.  As soon as one would disappear another would then reappear. It was a cloudy night, roughly 37F, winds ESE at 15MPH, visibility 8mi. it had previously rain that day so the ground was wet, but was not currently raining at time of event.;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756

Fireball inside a vertical triangle.;2013-08-23 22:00:00;1 minute;Fireball inside a vertical triangle My wife, mother-in-law and I were sitting on the patio enjoying a fire when I noticed a bright object out of the corner of my eye.   When it came into clear view, I am guessing the object was no more than 300 feet in the air and it made no noise. It looked as if a fireball was inside a vertical triangle. There did not seem to be a front portion to the object and it moved in a straight line with an occasional zigzag and hovered for a short time just before it went out of our sight..;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756
