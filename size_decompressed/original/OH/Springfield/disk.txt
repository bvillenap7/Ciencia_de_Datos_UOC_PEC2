I was sitting down on the wood deck and crossed legged and leaned back into a position flat on my back looking up at the clouds.  From behinf my head I saw what appeared as two white parachutes above a tree line moving southward in direction. I was confused as they appeared white but were not dropping but were traveling at the same altitude in a forward direction.  I caled my friend over and stood up to get a better look at the objects.  As they moved across the skyline the color changed from white to the burnt orange color of the sunset. It was then I realized they were reflecting light not producing light.  The sunshine was reflecting as if off a mirror and as they moved across the sky the reflection changed. Appeared cigar in shape from side view then appeared disk from rear view.
