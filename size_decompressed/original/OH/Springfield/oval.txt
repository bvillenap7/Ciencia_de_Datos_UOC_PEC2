3 lighted oval aircraft dissapears;2003-09-11 19:50:00;30 minutes;3 lighted oval aircraft dissapears it was late one night and i was in the shower and i decided to take a look out the window and check on our dogs. I looked up in the sky and saw a stationary oval figure that appeared to be rotating or have rotating lights on it. It stayed in that exact spot in the sky for at least ten minutes and i thought my eyes my be playing tricks on me so i left the window and got out of the shower and dressed.  I went back to the window about 20 minutes later and looked up in the sky and the object was gone. There was absolutely nothing in the sky near where the object was when i was in the shower.
