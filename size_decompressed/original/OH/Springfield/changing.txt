I was riding my bike down the street when something red in the sky caught my attention, it looked as if a plane was on fire at first but as it got closer to me I noticed that it definately wasn't a plane!  It was like a round object with an orange bottom and the most significant thing I noticed was the circular laser type light rotating over top of the object!  As it was moving about medium speed I raced back to my house on my bike and was suprised to see that it had picked up speed!  By the time my brother came out and saw it, the light above it faded out and it was gone over the trees!  The city was Springfield Ohio in the west end neighborhood skys.;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756
