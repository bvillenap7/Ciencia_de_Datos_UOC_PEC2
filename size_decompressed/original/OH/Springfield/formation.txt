6 unknown lights traveling in a straight line;1999-11-16 19:05:00;150 seconds;6 unknown lights traveling in a straight line On November 16 1999 at 19:05 hours I was walking out of my local grocery store when I noticed the largest object in the sky I have ever seen it was a line of six yellow/white lights traveling in a southwesterly direction at an extremely low rate of speed, I was able to view these lights for a period of 2 minutes 30 seconds until they went away as if someone had thrown a switch to turn them off. I am a 31 year old male who has worked in the security field for the last 13 years so I am trained to notice detail and times that unusual events occur. I also attended College at Wright State University Dayton Ohio and Lived on Campus which was right in the flight path for all aircraft landing at Wright-patterson airforce base so I am familiar with all conventional aircraft and I had never before seen an object of this type;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756
Above the reservoir we saw a formation of 20 or more orange lights streching across the sky.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-16 19:00:00;3 minutes;My friend was driving me home, when above the reservoir we saw a formation of 20 or more orange lights stretching across the sky.  It looked like they were hovering 200 to 300 feet off the ground. They seemed to have a reddish glow in the center of the mass it almost looked on fire.  When my friend was driving back from dropping me off they were gone.;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756
