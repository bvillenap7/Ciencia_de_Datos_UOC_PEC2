I was 13 years old and living in Springfield, Ohio. At approximately 9 p.m., I was in an urban shopping mall parking lot, sitting on the trunk of my father's car while he and my brother finished shopping inside. There was dense low cloud cover, perhaps at 1,000 feet altitude. I was tossing a toy up in the air and catching it ... once, twice. But on the third toss, as I watched the toy, my eyes drifted away to the most incredible sight I have ever seen. Three enormous white lights -- each about the size of a cup saucer -- silently hung in the sky. They were above the blanket of clouds, so they were diffused. Together, they formed an even more enormous equilateral triangle. If the lights were the endpoints of a single triangular object, each side would roughly equal the length of an American football field. I blinked, looked down and closed my eyes, then looked back up again. The lights remained directly overhead. The lights just hovered there, motionless, for about a minute. Then, in unison, they began to rotate in a slow counter-clockwise pattern. Simultaneously, they began moving north at about 30-40 mph. There was no engine or rotor noise of any kind. Beyond the extraordinary silence, the motion itself was bizarre: There seemed to be no acceleration. The motion was instantaneous and fluid. (Imagine having a VCR set on Pause, then pressing Play to watch something move.) Within a couple of minutes, the lights had moved over a nearby hill and out of view. In a mix of shock, fear, and excitement, I immediately ran back into the shopping mall to find my father and brother. I told them what I had seen and demanded that we get in the car and drive north, to see if we could find the lights. They humored me, but we saw nothing. I knew they probably thought I was crazy, but I didn't care. As far as I know, there were no other witnesses around the shopping mall. But I never bothered to check. Also, my father -- who happened to be a prominent city politician -- had friends at the local municipal airport, which also served as an Air National Guard base. At my request, he phoned the control tower to find out if there had been any unusual air traffic that night. There wasn't. I was completely perplexed, and remain so to this day.

Triangular Craft Headed Toward  Wright Patterson Air Force Base;2007-11-07 20:25:00;3-5 minuets;Triangular Craft Headed Toward  Wright Patterson Air Force Base At 8:25pm on November 7th, I left my home to go pick my daughter up from work.  As I headed down my street I could see what I thought was an airplane flying due south at a very low altitude. It had two bright white lights that appeared to be at either end of the wing span.  I was concerned because I thought it was going to crash or might possibly be landing at springfield airport. I lost sight of it, but when I got to the main street and turned there it was coming right back at me. It then made a gradual turn to the west toward Wright Patterson Air Force Base and I lost sight of it again. When I turned into the parking lot where my daughter works there it was again, only this time there was a third white light on at the third point. It was distinctively triangular shaped, made no sound, was huge.I am amazed that this craft could make these turns at such a low altitude. I then got back into my car and no sooner had I closed the door and there it was again.I climbed back out and watched it as it headed back west toward the base. We drove several blocks to the west but did not see it again.;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756
