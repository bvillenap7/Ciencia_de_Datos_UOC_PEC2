Small fleet large craft over Ohio;1974-08-01 22:00:00;30 minutes;Small fleet large craft over Ohio It was in the summer of 1974 and I'm not sure of the month.I was driving in the country side with my girlfriend when I noticed an orange glow in the sky.It was about 10 P.M.The light appeared to be just a flood light.Then I saw another.I turned my car around in a driveway to see what they were when the bright orangish lights went out and red blinking lights came on.As I sped down the road towards them I could see 2 more orangish lights low to the ground.At the same time I could see the 2 other red lights,at a distance from each other,going straight up.They were over a lake.I drove at a high rate of speed toward the orangish lights.As I was getting closer,still miles away,the main lights went out and the red blinking lights came on.Now I was on flat land and could see that there were not just 4 or 6 of them.They were flying in a straight line,2 by 2,and there were at least a dozen of them.Finally I was within 100 feet of one of them.They were flying at about 10 to 20 mph.One broke off from its line of travel just over an Ohio State Patrol post and headed West.It came to a complete stop behind a poorly lit restaurant.It made no noise,was still,didn't stir wind,and was about 300 feet above me.I had my head out the window of my car and all I could see was flood lights in two's.It was about the size of an airliner or longer.It was too dark and I was blinded by the lights.After about 30 seconds my girlfriend looked up at it through the windshield.She went hysterical hitting me screaming for me to leave.The crart followed me for a short distance and turned back towards the fleet.
