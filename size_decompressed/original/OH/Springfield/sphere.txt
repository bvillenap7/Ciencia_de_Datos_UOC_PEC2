Witnesses:  male 64 female 59.   Male witness- saw 4 round lights suddenly appear from the southeast, traveling northwest. Bright orange center almost red with a halo of bright white light. Steady on lamination not flashing.  They made a slow path way  path across the sky the turned due west as a military cargo plane flew toward them.   Suddenly 4 more of the same glowing spheres appeared from the same path the previous 4 had taken.  I ran from the street to my front door to get my wife.  She followed me and saw 6 of the 8.  The other 2 had disappeared.  As we watched and attempted to photo with our iPhones, the spheres disappeared in the sky.  They did not appear to shut off or speed away.  They just vanished.  I have lived near the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base most all of my life.  I have never seen anything like I saw last night.  My wife made the same comment.   No flashing lights as you would expect to see from a aircraft.  The pictures we took show only 4 white dots.  They made no sound.;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756
