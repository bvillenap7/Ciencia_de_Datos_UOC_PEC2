Offset X Formation Below Mars;2001-12-02 19:25:00;5 seconds;Offset X Formation Below Mars I observed approximately 14 objects moving from east to west just below Mars. These objects were in an offset X formation, moving from east to west at a speed just a bit slower than satellites i've observed in the past. Approximately 5 seconds after first noticing the objects, they quickly vanished. Their color was a light amber and were pinpoint in appearance. I'm a lifelong amateur star gazer.;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756
Bright silver fast moving light in the sky made a quick 180 degree turn, comtrail photographed.;2011-11-16 16:00:00;5 seconds;Bright silver fast moving light in the sky made a quick 180 degree turn, comtrail photographed. I was in the woods deer hunting this afternoon 11/16/2011 at 4pm.   A sudden bright silver light caught my attention in the sky over my head approaching fast from the west.  It was bright like a camera flash but sustained for the 5 seconds it was in view.  The object traveled in a wide circle 180 degrees in the sky overhead leaving a white comtrail returning to the west where it came from.   Object was real fast, only in view 5 seconds, however I photograped the comtrail and submit the photos along with this report.  Sound was hissing air sound, not real loud.   Location I was at is a woods west of Springfield Ohio, Clark County.  Woods location is surrounded by highways St.Rt.41 to the West and South, Upper Valley Pike to the East and Fox Hollow Road to the North.  My specific location was about 3/4 mile North West of the Upper Valley Mall and intersection of Ross Lane and Upper Valley Pike. Wright Patterson AFB is about 12 miles to the South West.  The directi! on the object came from and returned to is due West.;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756
Sporadically moving star;2012-07-04 03:00:00;1+ hours;Sporatically moving star I was watching fireworks when I saw what seemed to be a bright star in the sky.  The more I watched it I noticed it moving.  From that point I thought it was a satellite until it started moving really sporadically.   I've never heard of any craft that moves like it did.  It moved in many different directions at a high rate of speed and stopped suddenly in its path.   I watched it for about an hour. I noticed it emitted flashes of orange light periodically.  Very strange to say the least.;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756
12 to 15 Orange, red lights over Spfld.Ohio confuse onlookers Sat. 27 2012;2012-10-27 21:00:00;1 hour;12 to 15 Orange,red lights over Spfld.Ohio confuse onlookers Sat. 27 2012 I live in Springfield,Ohio,and on Saturday night Oct 27th,about 9:00pm, 12 to 15 orange lights came over my neighbors house,across the street, directly over my house and out into the field and vanished.   They were bright orange in color,but not a solid color,not pulsating,but like embers or the end of a cigar that's just been lit.  Sometimes they would come 2 at a time,sometimes 3 or 4,but always following each other in the same direction.   Some were close together and some would come after the others had vanished.  They were below the cloud cover and moved at a steady pace.  No shape could be made out on either side or the front or back.  The most striking feature was that something this close and given the size of it...made no noise.It was clear that they were powered somehow,not just floating,but NO noise.;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756
Low and slow cruising white ball of light fades to orange then disappears.;2013-08-23 22:00:00;~1 minute;Low and slow cruising white ball of light fades to orange then disappears. At approximately 22:00 in Springfield Ohio, while taking a walk in the neighborhood, we witnessed what could only be described as a UFO.  We've both been living near the Ohio Air National Guard base/Spfld.  Municipal Airport, WPAFB, and Dayton International Airport for the majority of our lives, I think it's safe to say we know what aircraft look like, even at night. I just happened to look up into the sky and this thing immediately caught my eye as being unusual. It was cruising at a relatively low altitude and speed compared to other air traffic in the vicinity.  It displayed NONE of the standard FAA required lighting and made NO sound.  Surprising for how low and close it was.  Also, it appeared to have no distinguishable outline.  Basically it just looked like a ball of white light.  I said to the ladyfriend, That's kind of strange.  We both were standing there watching this thing when it suddenly faded into an orangish color then COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED.  There were absolutely no clouds in the sky and this thing was very far from the horizon where it could've appeared to have vanished.  For the rest of the walk home we were comparing the air traffic to what we just saw.  It was apparent we saw something unusual.  No red/green or blinking lights on wing tips which were clearly visible on aircraft at a much higher altitude.  Definitely NOT a satellite because the altitude was WAY too low.;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756
3 orange lights appear over springfield ohio move speraticly and vanish.;2015-05-10 21:15:00;5 minutes;3 orange lights appear over Springfield, Ohio, move speraticly and vanish. As I was traveling north on Derr Rd. in Springfield, Ohio, I looked up to see two orange lights traveling at what appeared to be aircraft speed in a South/Southeastern direction.  At first a believed that they were planes or helicopters but the light was orange and constant (not flashing).  There were a few small clouds floating around in the area so I could tell that one was higher than the other but they were traveling at the same speed in the same direction. After about two minutes going in a straight path the higher one stopped immediately as the lower one continued on.  A third orange light appeared just above the one that had stopped.  The two lights stayed in that position for around 30 seconds then began a very fast circle as if chasing one another.  As the two performed the circle the lower stopped abruptly and just sat in one position. The two lights moving in a circle flashed once and were gone.  There was still sunlight in the sky, enough to see a silhouette of a plane if thats what it was, but there was nothing.  They were both completely gone. Immediately after the two dissapeared the third made a very sharp angled u-turn travelled a short distance flashed once and vanished just as the first two did.  I watched the surrounding sky for 30 minutes after to see if there were any more or any commercial aircrafts in the area but there were none.;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756
