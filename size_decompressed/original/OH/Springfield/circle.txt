10-27-12 Springfield Ohio 5 witnesses saw 12/15 red/orange objects moving thru sky with no noise in same path.;2012-10-27 21:30:00;half hour;10-27-12 Springfield Ohio 5 witnesses saw 12/15 red/orange objects moving thru sky with no noise in same path. I was called by my friend to come out of the house to see what turned out to be 12 to 15 large objects in the sky.  They appeared in groups of two to three.  The moon was bright and to the right of where the objects appeared.  They flew in the same path and were a pulsating red/orange color.  There was no noise with these objects.  They all followed the same direction and went directly over where we were standing.   All the objects just seemed to disappear about the same location to the rear of our house. The objects seemed to move very fast with no noise and in the same direction.  I attempted to take pictures with digital camera but the quality is poor and does not show what i saw.;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756

I saw what appeared to be planes or helicopters with red lights coming from the SSW moving to the NW following each other. Then a large aircraft (ship) approached from the east, with white lights on the bottom, headed west. Two more of the aircraft with red lights appeared and joined the others.  All five of these then seemed to be following the path of the big ship.  They all disappeared on the horizon. Did anyone else see this?  Their red lights caught my attention.;39.9405285059576;-83.8081098991756
