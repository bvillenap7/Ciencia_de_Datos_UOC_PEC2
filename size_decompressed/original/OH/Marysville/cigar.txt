Cigar shaped UFO spotted on the horizon in Marysville, Ohio;2017-04-23 20:15:00;0.2;Cigar shaped UFO spotted on the horizon in Marysville, Ohio Looking west from Marysville, OH, I saw a stationery craft in the sky with a light which moved from left to right and then back to the left.  It looked flat in shape, like a pancake.   Suddenly, the craft moved straight up in the sky, and then tilted toward the South and quickly shot across the horizon.  When it tilted I could tell it was wider at the top and narrower toward the bottom.  There was no noise.   The craft was about 5 to 10 miles away.  It traveled a distance of about 10 miles in about 5 seconds before I lost sight of it.;40.2458852747254;-83.360310769231
