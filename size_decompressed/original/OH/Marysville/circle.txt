Disk like object with 12 lights rotating through the northeastern sky at 11PM.  ((anonymous report));2019-05-25 23:00:00;15 seconds;Disk like object with 12 lights rotating through the northeastern sky at 11PM. My roommate and I were out on the back porch when he told me to look up (northeastern sky).  A plane was flying by and way off in the distance was something round, almost shaped like a Ferris wheel.  The object was very large, and it almost looked as if it was rolling through the atmosphere.  As far as I could count about a dozen lights were on the outside edge of the object.  Imagine a giant Ferris Wheel rolling down a hill.  The object was only visible for about 15 seconds then it faded off in the distant darkness.
