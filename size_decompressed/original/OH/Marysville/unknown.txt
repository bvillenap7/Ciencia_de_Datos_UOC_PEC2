Strange lights over Central Ohio.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-24 05:20:00;10 minutes;Strange lights over Central Ohio On the morning of 11/24/2019 at 0520 as I was warming up the my vehicle to go into work, I noticed some strange lights in the SE part of the sky above the moon. What caught my attention at first was two bright solid lights going across the sky, not too fast or too slow, wider wingspan than a commercial airliner at that distance. No clouds or any obstructions for my view, as I was watching that first light I started to notice multiple single bright lights following it. As far as I could tell they were going at the same speed and keeping the same distance from each other. I then noticed that they seemed to to just appear at the same point in the sky. I looked for them to be traveling across the sky, however, I only noticed to becoming visible from the same spot in the sky. I would have to say that at least 20 lights that I noticed. The same two bright lights beside each other came and nothing else was seen. I could not make out any shape of an aircraft, just s! trange lights that were following each other.;40.2458852747254;-83.360310769231
