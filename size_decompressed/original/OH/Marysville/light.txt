At approx. 9:45 EST and viewing the ENE sky from our back deck, a light appeared midway in the sky.  The light appeared to be hovering, and went from a dim white, orange, red.   Within less than a second or two, this light dropped at a hooked angle from left to right.   As it dropped there was a white trail behind it.  When it stopped it appeared to hover just above tree level, and was a bright white, which only lasted maybe 3 or 4 seconds, went dim, and then disappeared.;40.2458852747254;-83.360310769231

One resembled satellite as far as distance goes.  Dodged at a fast pace heading SE then shot into space.  The other was right above town, as bright as a spotlight, made a loop over and also shot fast back into space.  This made me pay attention this week.  Another was red, as high as a satellite and moved fast and dodgy to the west and disappeared.  On 10/11 another red craft hovered in the west and moved north to hover then continued west.  Soon after one more white light appeared just south of the Big Dipper and headed south until it gradually went up and out of the atmosphere.  Not planes or anything to my knowledge man made.
