Hexagon shaped aircraft with blue lights spotted flying above US Rt. 33 between Marysville and Dublin;2014-06-28 02:30:00;30 seconds;Hexagon shaped aircraft with blue lights spotted flying above US Rt. 33 between Marysville and Dublin I was driving westbound on US Rt. 33 towards Marysville.  I was getting close to Scottslawn Rd. when I saw an aircraft of some sort that I initially thought might be circling around to land at Union County airport.  But then it started heading towards me above Rt 33.  It seemed to be rather low, so I paid close attention to it.  As it drew nearer to me I came to realize it did not appear to be an airplane or helicopter.  I got a good look at it as it passed above me out the driver side window.  It was maybe 200 feet up in the air, and it was a hexagonal shape, and on the bottom of the craft, there was a large blue circular light in the middle, and smaller blue circular lights at each corner of the hexagon.  Also, what struck me as being very strange is the craft made no sound.   If it were a jet or any other craft I'm familiar with, at that altitude, it would have been pretty loud.  It was really weird, and freaked me out.  It was headed towards Dublin, OH down rt. 33.  Definitely the weirdest thing I've ever seen in person with my own eyes.  There is only 3 possibilities of what it was in my mind, a secret military/government aircraft, a drone (but it was too big to be a drone I think), or an alien spacecraft.;40.2458852747254;-83.360310769231
