NW to SE in direction. Craft seemed disorganized in that the shape was not unifor. It seemed to be floundering for a time and then turned white and vanished.  The period of time that it was floundering was probably for a couple of seconds, like it was repowering, and then it vainished without a sound.  It was like nothing and then it disappeared.  It didn't look like any conventional aircraft that I have ever seen and made no noise.  It was as big as a green bean at arm's length in the sky and I was stupified.  It went straight west and then North very quickly.  The sky's here are overcast and rainy.;40.2458852747254;-83.360310769231
