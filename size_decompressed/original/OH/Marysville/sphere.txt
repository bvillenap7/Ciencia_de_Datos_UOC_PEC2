Red and appeared to flicker.;2017-07-02 21:30:00;2-3 minutes;Red and appeared to flicker. I had my telescope out and observed a red light to the West going East, I was observing with the naked eye, the Telescope was not setup yet as Polaris was not visible, there were light clouds, the light appeared to flicker somewhat, observation was about 1 to 2 minutes, the Sky was just before complete darkness, it also seemed to meander somewhat while going east, it was not a straight line.;40.2458852747254;-83.360310769231
