Numerous fireballs moving from SSW to NNE.;2010-11-26 17:30:00;2-3 minutes;Numerous fireballs moving from SSW to NNE. At approximately 5:30 P.M., I happened to be in the driveway of a relative's home and happened to look to the west and saw an unusual cluster of fireballs moving at a fairly rapid pace out of the SSW.  The objects were more than 1000 ft. high but lower than a passenger aircraft would fly at cruising altitude. The objects were a deep red color. There were more than 12, and I counted at least 16.  They did not appear to be moving in a particular formation and some were slightly higher than others.  The objects did not flicker but did appear brighter on the leading edges of the objects.  They were not perfectly circular. There was no noise and no other aircraft observed in the area. As I recall, the winds were calm and sky was clear.  The sun had set, but it was still twilight. The objects continued toward the NNE and disappeared out of sight after approximately 2-3 minutes. I have seen so-called Chinese lanterns before, but these were very unusual, as they appeared to be brighter on the 'leading' edges.  I doubt these would have been flares since it was a holiday weekend and there are no nearby military bases. I did take photos, and the quality isn't great, but one can discern the color and shape of the objects.  Several other family members also observed but we could not conclude what we had seen.;40.2458852747254;-83.360310769231
