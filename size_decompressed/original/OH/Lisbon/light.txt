I later saw another such object and my mother told me their were seven all together. I went inside my house to play Sega after playing capture the flag with my sisters.  I went back out when my mother called, and followed her finger to a small, reddish object moving South.  We continued to watch the object until it fadded away.  I then went inside to call the UFO reporting center.  Then I went outside and saw another object moving East.  The UFO center called  back and my mother, her friend's daughter, and my two sisters came in after me and said that their had been a total of seven UFOs, all of which faded in and out and had a reddish glow.;40.7588;-80.7592

Dot of light moves across the sky twice.;2006-10-06 18:56:00;Ten seconds;Dot of light moves across the sky twice. I was taking the dog out, and gazed at the blue sky with the sun setting, creating orange clouds. I saw a silverish light, about the size of a dot from my view, appear out of nowhere, moving side step, and vanished in two seconds. A second later, I saw the same thing in the corner of my eye. I turned to look at it, it looked like the same thing, moving side step, and it disapeared.;40.7588;-80.7592
