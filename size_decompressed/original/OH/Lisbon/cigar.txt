I was on the back end of my rap-around porch this morning preparing for a mechanical aptitude test when a strange loud noise came from behind me? i jump up and looked right behind me and saw nothing.but my study guides fell over and just though how weird this is anyway 10 minutes later i heard the scream of an jet throttle power up so I jump up ran around the side of the house looking to the sky for a plane in trouble?I saw a passenger plane in the horizon at 45 degrees climbing as fast as it could And I am stareing at this when i saw another object right below it in the sky I though wow almost a clision in mid - air!Right then across the road I saw a UFO take off across the road about 300 yards way,Floating upward very slow and did not make a sound!!!It looked just like a silver plane with no wings or tail?Made no sound and almost looked like a silver cigar with lights rotateing around it at a 45 degree angle?the time is 10:50 am.I ran in side the house and grabbed the camera and ran back as fast as i could and was able to get off 2 pictures of this craft.Now while i was shooting this pictures it began to move very slow creap heading straight north.I live in northeastern ohio (LISBON) one hour west of pittsburgh and about 33 miles south of youngstown  ok,The minute i snapped the secound picture the craft blast north without a sound.my camera is standard not digital so i have to still get film developed yet,So after all this I go back to the deck sit down and try to relax because im really shaken up right now.About 6 minutes later A military fighter jet flew over lisbon up over our hill behind are house and made a 90 degree turn,this jet was totally sideways over our house about 500 feet off the ground!!!!The noise from it was huge. Im surprized that your windows did not break .this jet was fallowing the same path that this silver cigar was travelling end north.Ten munites later another jet fighter was circleing around lisbon and that is it.Cant wait to get pictures developed.Question? Were should I go to develope this film to make sure I get these pictures back?If anyone saw anything like this today please reply to my e-mail- ((e-address deleted))     I will post pictures a.s.a.p.;40.7588;-80.7592
