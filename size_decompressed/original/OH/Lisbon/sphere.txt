Glowing orb seen 3 days in a row in Ohio.;2012-12-11 05:00:00;1 hour;A glowing orb seen 3 days in a row in Ohio December 13, 2012    This is the third day my mother has watched a glowing orb hovering over a small lake in Lisbon, Ohio.  On December 11th at approximately 5:30 a.m.  she saw a glowing ball of light above the lake by her home.  She said it was the size of an exercise ball.   It moved  slowly up and down the lake and at times would hover, she would see a light shining down on the water , and then a splash like a small explosion (like an M80) thrown in the water.  This occurred for quite a while…when it began getting lighter outside it would disappear.   Amazingly, it was there on the next day and then today it was there again!    She said today it didn’t shoot into the water!   She is not prone exaggeration, has lived there for many years and is actually a little afraid.  I hope it is there tomorrow too!
