Bright red circular craft in mid-air doing circles;2012-11-09 23:30:00;10 minutes;a bright red circular craft in mid-air doing circles I looked out of my window and saw a faint light at first I thought it was just a star.  But, then it went black after a minute or so the light returned and gradually grew brighter like a reddish orange color. It then circled the air for about five minutes.  It went black again then turned back on then got super bright as it traveled south east towards my position I thought it may have saw my lights in my house so, crouched down and watched it fly over my house and it didnâ€™t return for the rest of the night.;40.7588;-80.7592
