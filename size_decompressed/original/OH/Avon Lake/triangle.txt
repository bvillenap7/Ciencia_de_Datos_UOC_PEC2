Triangular shape seen hovering and then moving away from neighborhoods and roads.;2014-12-21 00:20:00;20 minutes;Triangular shape seen hovering and then moving away from neighborhoods and roads. I was driving home from a friend's house by the lake when I saw what I thought at the time was a low flying plane with green and red lights flying away from me.  About 8 minutes later, as I turned away from the lake heading towards my house, I saw the same lights over a housing development.   I then witnessed the lights stopping over a house and saw that they were in a triangular formation.  One light was green on light was red and one light was clear.  The triangular shape was about the same size of the house and low enough that I could make out the edges of the shape.  I put my car in park by the house across the street from the house that the triangle was over intending to take a picture or video when it started moving away.  I then proceeded to follow it around until it stopped over enough development closer to the lake.  The same pattern of following the shape and stopping under or near it continued for approximately 20 minutes.  It hovered over the high school softball field, various neighborhoods, and road intersections.   Whenever it would move the green and red lights went out while the clear light remained blinking.  I was able to take a short video of the clear blinking light moving.  I was on the phone with my brother from half of the event and then I stopped following the triangular shape to pick him up to show him what I was describing to him.  We went in the direction that I last saw it heading, but was unable to find it again after 20 minutes of searching.;41.502;-82.0091000000001
