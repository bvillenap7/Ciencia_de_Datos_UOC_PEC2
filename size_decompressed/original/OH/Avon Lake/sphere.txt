White orb descends from the ceiling in my house and disappears.  ((anonymous report));2002-10-27 17:00:00;3 seconds;White orb descends from the ceiling in my house and disappears. In the fall of 2002 or 2003, I was sitting on my sofa in our family room.  My youngest daughter was a teenager at that time.  It was early evening, and she climbed on top of our sturdy solid wooden TV console that was about 5 feet tall. She was acting silly, curling up on her side with her hoodie pulled over her head and face.  As I was watching her, one of our cats was sitting on the floor about 3 feet from me just a little to the left in front of me. In my line of vision, while watching my daughter, a solid bright white ball of light appeared about 2 feet from the ceiling.  It proceeded to descend at a steady, but slow enough pace, to observe its size to be between a volleyball and a basketball.  The descent lasted about 3 feet before it disappeared about 2 feet from the floor.  My daughter never saw it because her head and face were covered, but her cat was staring where the ball disappeared about 2 feet above the floor. For years, I just assumed it was supernatural, but I've been reading more about these types of orbs possibly being extraterrestrial.  I live in Ohio where frequent UFO sightings have been reported.  It's interesting to think that it could be extraterrestrial. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
