Two fireballs spotted around 1115pm from the shores of Lake Erie.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2010-07-21 23:00:00;15 minutes;Two fireballs spotted around 1115pm from the shores of Lake Erie. Tonight in Avon Lake, Ohio, at approximately 10:00pm my girlfriend and I saw something bright in the sky that was about 10 times the size of a bright star, when she asked if it was a star, I wasn’t sure. This “star” (first being spotted WNW) began moving west at a very slow rate and becoming more orange as it furthered itself in the distance.  At roughly 11:15pm we got out of the lake and I went to see if I could still see the star, I could barely see it.  In the time it took me to walk 15 feet back to my girlfriend, I looked back in the sky and there was what looked to be a fireball in the sky.  It was NNW in the sky and roughly a 45/50 degree angle off the water, about 40 times the size as the brightest star in the sky. This fireball was incredibly bright, with a yellowish color.  We had talked about how it was weird and possibly a plane.  I looked at my girlfriend, made another statement and looked back and there was a second fireball (about 25 times the size of the brightest star in the sky).  These lights hovered in the same exact spot for about 8 minutes or so.  One began to move while the other stayed stationary. The first fireball moved directly north, then directly east and looked exactly like a plane, then began to take a square shape and continue moving east.  The second fireball remained in place for about 5 more minutes and was still in the same position when we left. I’ve lived on Lake Erie my whole life and I have seen orange orbs that seem to be unexplainable. Objects moving far faster than a plane would move.  However I haven’t seen anything like this before. I was blown away when I used google.com and saw others were talking about this fireball in the sky.  I hope my information has helped and I will be sure to post any further sightings I see.;41.502;-82.0091000000001
Red Orange Objects.;2012-11-22 18:10:00;7 minutes;Red Orange Objects In the vicinity of Lake Rd. and Brunswick Dr. in Avon Lake on 11/22/12 (Thanksgiving Evening) my wife noticed a group of 5 slow moving Red-Orange lights moving moving South to North towards the Lake.   Eventually, we stopped the car and got out on a side street near our destination which was in this area.  The 5 objects passed directly overhead, making no noise. Estimated elevation was approximately 3000 feet. Three additional objects came from South to North. At our final destination, 6 more people came out of the house to see and confirm the objects.  The red-orange glow on two of the objects went out and the lights came back on again.   A 10th object was seen to the northwest, moving West to East along the lake shore (Lake Road in Avon Lake).   All objects moved at a consistent speed. Each maintained course and elevation for the period in which we watched them.
