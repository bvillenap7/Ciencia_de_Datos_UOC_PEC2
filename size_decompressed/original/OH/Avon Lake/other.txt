slaughterhouse 5 revisited;2000-05-03 22:30:00;minute+;slaughterhouse 5 revisited i was dog sittting for my parents, and the dog and i went to the shore of lake erie.  i saw what seemed to be a star (again (see my previous submission if you have it)) that moved from NW to SSE.  I was west of the thing.  as it moved, it was star-bright, then it got to be much brighter, then returned to star-bright again.  as it continued SSE, i lost sight of the thing due to the excessive ambient light (street lights) of lake rd (US6.) i also saw a reddish shooting star in the east as i lost the thing in the ambient light. there were three airplanes (i can tell planes from this thing because of the stobes on planes (this thing had no strobes)) in the N heading E, there was one plane to the N heading SSW.;41.502;-82.0091000000001
