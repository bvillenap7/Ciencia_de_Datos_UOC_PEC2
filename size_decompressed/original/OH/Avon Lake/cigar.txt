Metallic cigar shaped object observed over Lake Erie.;2018-04-07 14:20:00;3 minutes;Metallic cigar shaped object observed over Lake Erie. On Saturday April 7, 2018, at about 2:20pm, I was driving east in Avon Lake, Ohio, on Krebbs Road, which is about 3 miles south of Lake Erie.  This road also passes into Bay Village, Ohio.  It was a sunny day with a clear blue sky, and temperatures in the low thirties.  As I was headed eastbound, I looked out my drivers side window to the north as saw a silver metallic cigar shaped object with no wings, no tail and no contrail.  The object appeared to be at a distance above Lake Erie. I slowed down, and intermittently looked at the object.  At one of the times I looked at it, I observed a horizontal red band in the middle of the object that was a quarter to a third of the object's length, however the next time I looked at it the band was no longer visible. When I reached the end of the road at Bradley Rd, I was stopped by a traffic light.  I had to turn my head a little over my shoulder at this point and noticed the object was stationary in the sky.  I proceeded to drive a little ways north on Bradley Rd., but turned around in a couple of minutes and headed back west on Krebbs Rd.  I pulled into Bay Village City Services parking lot, got out of my car and looked north to the sky, but the object was gone.  I proceeded to call my husband at 2:27pm to tell him about this.  The object appeared in size to be about 2/3 the size of the moon in length. I previously reported another incident which occurred approximately 10/27/2002 and was reported on 9/3/17 and posted on 9/5/2017.;41.502;-82.0091000000001
