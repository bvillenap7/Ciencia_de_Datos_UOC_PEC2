Definitely not a plane as it much larger than airplane lights would appear. No tail was seen.  I saw it first while letting the dog out then called to my wife who also saw it.   We live in a rural area with no background lights from any city.  We both have witnessed the usual meteor showers so we are familiar with how they appear.  This was totally unfamiliar.  The object glowed red,orange, yellow and you could say that it appeared to be on fire.;41.2941;-81.2283000000001
