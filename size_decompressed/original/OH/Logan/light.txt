Very fast light high in sky;2019-09-20 20:45:00;5 minutes;Very fast light high in sky It was very very high.  I thought it was a meteor. I saw a light going across very high and it was faint and extremely small so it must have been high.  I thought it was a meteor because it was going way too fast to be an airplane. we get airplane here and they're lower and lights blink.  This shot across the sky way too fast and didnt burn up.  Just went the full distance of skyscrapers that were visible to me.;39.5348000000001;-82.4096000000003
