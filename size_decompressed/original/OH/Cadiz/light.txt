I was coming in from work when I noticed a white light globe off in the distance over my house.  As I got closer to my home the globe started moving very quickly across the sky.  It would move east then stop on a dime and move west, stop again and go straight up and east as if it was nothing.  I pulled in my drive way and the white light globe lowered itself but was about 3 miles away from me and it hoovered again and the white light turned red.  It stood there for a few seconds then started west and the red light began flashing really really fast like a strobe light and it just vanished.  I live outside of town with few light and I could hear dogs all over town barking soon as the light vanished all the dogs stopped barking.  Two days ago at about the same time I was watching tv when my entire house started shaking very faintly though enough that my candles in the window seal where vibrating off the window.  I am a ((deleted)) officer and have 4 years of college as ((law enforcement)) Major and am a very respected person in my community.  Its a small rural area and something of this nature is not discussed.  Soon as the light vanished I ran inside grabbed my camcorder and drove to the top of the hill where you can see for miles but the light never came back.  I'll be waiting for it tomorrow.;40.2618;-81.0303

The lights were traveling faster than any plane I've ever seen fly and it only appeared for about 10 seconds before none of us seen them any longer.;40.2618;-81.0303
