Real UFO sited but denied  (missile launch ,lol)NOT!!;2006-12-16 07:00:00;5 MIN;Real UFO sited but denied  (missile launch ,lol)  NOT!! Just wanted to say very disappointed . Reported a UFO that occurred 12/16/06 in Ohio ,you state it was a missle lauch . What are you covering up ?  It was craft way to low in sky, missles dont stop .Dont turn into portholes in the sky . Vanish and reappear .  They dont stop rotate before your eyes , emit smoke cloud so it can't be seen (CAMO).I saw windows, I saw the smoke rolling out of this craft as it rotated . How if it was a missle could I see windows .  You deny whats ligit why ?  Look at other reports on that day same area.  I don't get it.  Still ticks me off to this day .;40.2618;-81.0303
