In the eastern hemisphere At approximately 8:30 pm on 8/29/2015, we witnessed 2 then a 3rd strange glowing lights ? In the southern hemisphere moving east very quick then stopping for about 3 -5 seconds.   Then one by one they shot straight up into the atmosphere it took 3-4 seconds to disappear.   No sounds no red green blinking lights .  At first they appeared to be Chinese lanterns with same glowing color.  For sure they were not.  And they were not helicopters .  3 of us watched in amazement.  I'm not a ufo chaser or anything of the sort.   I decided to report this 12 hrs later to local authorities.  This was just way to bizzare not to say anything.;41.3271000000003;-81.4513000000004
