White oval or disc on edge, low and moving north, possible puttering or sputtering noise with it.;2002-07-25 11:55:00;20 seconds;White oval or disc on edge, low and moving north, possible puttering or sputtering noise with it. While driving west on fairmount road, at the intersection of Rt. 91, spotted an off white oval or disc on edge object due west and at treetop level.  Partly cloudy skies.  Object was the length of my thumbnail at arms length.  Object moved north behind trees in the distance in apparent level flight.  No fins, tail, wings or markings visable at this distance, which may have been over a mile.  Lost sight as I traveled down into a small vally, and could not find it when at the crossroads of Cedar and Brainard a few minutes later, where the area is very open to the horizon. At home, heard a sputtering, puttering sound all afternoon from the north, but saw no craft of any kind.  My wife heard this sound also.  Assumed it could have been a blimmmb, but no mention on the news of blimp activity, which they always show.  It was very cloudy during the hours when the sound was active.
