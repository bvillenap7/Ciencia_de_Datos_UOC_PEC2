V-shaped light formation over Beachwood, OH;2003-01-30 19:15:00;30 seconds;V-shaped light formation over Beachwood, OH I was walking across the parking lot at the JCC in Beachwood to play volleyball.  It was a very clear night.  I was watching a small airplaneâ€™s lights traveling due west, when I noticed a V-shaped series of white lights above it, moving in the opposite direction (East).  It looked like a boomerang formation of 7 or 9 round lights.  It was higher and less clear than the plane and had a halo around it, as if it was in some thin clouds (perhaps it was).  The V was moving much faster than the airplane - maybe 5 times faster (not accounting for differences in distance from me).  Shortly after I caught sight of it, the V turned right (south).  It did so abruptly and without much of a curve through the turn.  When it changed direction, several of the lights seemed to rearrange themselves - as though they were discreet objects in a formation, not fixed to one single object.  They did so very quickly - spontaneously - to go from a eastbound V to a southbound V.  The wedge flew south into a part of the sky that was bright from city lights, and I lost it.  It made no sound I could hear, and no one was with me when I saw it.  The whole event lasted 20 to 30 seconds at most.  I have no idea what it could have been.;41.4712;-81.5247999999994
