massive sound that shook the house;2003-12-08 23:00:00;20 minutes;massive sound that shook the house My wife was woken up to the house shaking. My daughter is also a witness. No sightings, but a massive low frequency, slow cycling(2-3 second intevals),  rumbling sound that covered several miles and lasted 20 minutes. Similar to an eormous engine, like a locomotive starting up, but much larger. On the scale of an earthquake or tornado that sounds like a train coming into you house. Came from west of Beachwood,Ohio. (There are no trains located near this area and I have lived here for 51 years and never heard anything like this).There was some activity 2-3 miles away with a helicopter circling in the same spot for the 20 minutes I watched. Police departments had other complaints, but no answers. A neighbor that lives about a mile closer said that she also heard it, and that there were several helicopters circling the area. My wife's students live in that area and stated the same.;41.4712;-81.5247999999994
