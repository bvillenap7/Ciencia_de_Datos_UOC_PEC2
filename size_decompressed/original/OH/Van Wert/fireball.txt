Fireball  with tails in Ohio;2011-10-04 19:30:00;5 seconds;Fireball  with tails in Ohio I saw a fireball to the North of Van Wert, Ohio.  The fireball had two swirling tails. One was the same orange/red color as the fireball and one was a lighter yellow.  The image did not appear to be moving downward towards the earth, but instead upward towards the sky.  That was my perception because the tail was towards the ground.  I saw it one moment and it completely disappeard the next.  It did not appear to fly away, but rather just disappeared.;40.8692999999999;-84.585
