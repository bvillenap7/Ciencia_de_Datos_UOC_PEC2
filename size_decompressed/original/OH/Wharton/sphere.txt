I was in a field next to a woods, when I looked up and seen what I had thought it was a helecopter with a big spotlight behind the woods because of the way it moved up and down right and left like a helecopter.  Until I started to move towards it in the feild it had been about 100'foot in the air and the closer I got it moved away slowly I was stopped by a railroad track and it stopped also and then it moved up and down and back and forth real slow and I realized it was a ball of lite greyish white glowing and not sending out a beam also no noise.  I started to get nervous so I drove back to the woods I came from and shut the engine off again to try and here it still no sound I watched for a while as it moved slowly down to the ground and sat there for awhile It seemed about 50-75 foot across and I got within 2000 foot of it at the closest got scared and started the car to go in around the block and come in from the otherside of the mile square and as I got closer it went up and disapeared so I went home to get my son or a friend to come back and see it, but I found no one at home to go with me. So I went back out and on the way I saw it again any this time it was a mile over by a farmers house so I went straight instead of turning to where I was before and went as fast as I could towards to object and about a quarter mile away it took off this time real fast before it disapeared again off to the east and that was the last I saw of it.I didn't realize untilafter thinking about it that it put off no light and yet it was aball of light.
