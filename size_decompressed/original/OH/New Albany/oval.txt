Large UFO  in Ohio;1977-07-15 19:00:00;2.5 hours;Large UFO  in Ohio We were on the tractor at the farm, going down to the road to check the mailbox on a midsummer evening.  The tractor stalled on the way, so we left it there in the driveway, and walked dwon to the mailbox, and upon as we were walking back to the house, noticed how bright the evening star seemed that evening.  The four of us were in our mid 20s, tow males, two females.  Upon reaching the house, one of us noticed that the evening star seemed to be getting bigger and brighter, and we all went over and leaned on the fence, and watched as it became clear that it was an object approaching from the west, in the clear twilight sky.  after about an hour it was getting quite large, and was approaching our location directly, and shortly after that it was right overhead.  All the animals were quiet, and we all felt that it was going to land.  One of our group (female) ran out towards the object, which was as large as 1/2 acre accross, and had red lights on the edges.  We tried to discourage her, but she returned without incident to our position at the fence.  It seemed to hang there for a while, and we felt as if our thoughts were being monitored, very odd.  Just as it approached right over the farmhouse, it took a turn to the south and within a couple minutes it gained speed and vanished over the southern horizon.  We were all elated and a bit frightened to go back in the house (aliens in there?), but worked up the nerve, and had no problems, and the following day, the tractor started right up.  One of our group contacted Wright Patterson AFB about it and was not called back about it, and we seldom talked about it after that. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
