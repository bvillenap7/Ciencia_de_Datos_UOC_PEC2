My son was taking out the trash to the curb on Wednesday evening (March 25, 2020), at dusk, around 8:15pm.  He was looking up at the sky checking out the stars and noticed a bright white object way off in the distance (orb shaped - like a star) just above the horizon where the sky separates between dark and orange - facing West towards Worthington, Ohio.  The object was a bright orb shape and he noticed it was out of place considering other things in the sky (it wasn't moving).  He took a picture of it with his iphone (will send image) but no video unfortunately.  He looked at the object for about approximately 30 seconds and then the object took off at a 45 degree angle (heading South)toward space and was gone in a blink of an eye.  He was visibly shaken when he came back into the house.;40.0846999999999;-82.7988000000002
