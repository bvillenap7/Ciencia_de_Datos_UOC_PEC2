Bright green light shot across sky, changed to white, then back to green, then disappeared.;2008-10-29 21:11:00;30 seconds;Bright green light shot across sky, changed to white, then back to green, then disappeared. I saw light quickly move across the sky while I was driving.  Initially I thought it was a shooting star and then I realized it was MUCH bigger than any shooting star I've ever seen.  In addition it was BRIGHT green and it was lasting longer than any other shooting star episode I've ever experiences.   As I watched, mesmerized, the object moved further away from me (heading west) and it turned white and then back to green and then it was gone.  I didn't lose sight of it over the horizon, it just simply disappeared.  I assumed it was a meteorite...but who knows...
