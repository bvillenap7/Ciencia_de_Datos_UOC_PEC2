Second Sighting of Similar Event;2010-11-11 22:40:00;20 minutes;Second Sighting of Similar Event This summer, a friend and I reported this event (http://nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77475.html) In a different location with a different witness, I have experienced similar circumstances. Last night at approximately midnight, two flashing lights were spotted parallel to each other.  They were flashing red, blue, and white, and were slowly moving, individually of each other, in figure 8 patterns.  Tonight, at an earlier hour, the same friend and I witnessed these two lights again.  However, this time they were accompanied by two other lights only flashing red, on which moved up in a straight line, and one which moved horizontally.  The horizontal light changed directions after about five minutes of flight, and increased its speed to disappear into the southern periphery.  When we left the site, the two parallel flashing lights were still in the sky.;41.2925;-82.219
