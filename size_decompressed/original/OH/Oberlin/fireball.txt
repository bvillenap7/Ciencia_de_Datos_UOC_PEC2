6 golden round fireballs flying slow speed same distance appart;2020-05-03 22:00:00;2 minutes;6 golden round fireballs flying slow speed same distance appart Was walking through Oberlin black river/plum creek corridor and the clouds had just dissipated looked up at stars and noticed a round golden/fire like ball moving slowly in a straight line followed by five more following the same distance apart and eventually disappearing, there were now contrails.  30 seconds after that I saw a comet entering and completely dissipating into atmosphere right above the highest canopy tree.  I stumbled to grab my phone and video shortly realizing it was at home, this was surly a sight to see as I have never seen anything like it before.;41.2925;-82.219
