It stopped though within view of my window and up until 5:30 when I fell asleep it stayed within view moving in short random movements (up, down, right , left and so forth). I then woke up at 6:50 due to a noise and I looked at that area and the Craft was gone. However two classic shaped ufo crafts (saucers) with white lights surrounding the whole craft went by my window within a blink of an eye. It too fast for me too see anything inside and I donâ€™t know if it ever came back as I covered my windows after this incident as it was terrifying to me.;41.2925;-82.219
