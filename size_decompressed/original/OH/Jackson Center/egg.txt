High speed  disc;2012-07-10 18:30:00;3 seconds;High-speed  disc My friend and i were standing outside at around 630 pm when we were just talking about the days events.  We were by his garage wich stands only 70 ft from us.  We had are backs turned from the garage.   My friend mentioned something about the garage and we turned to look at it and there above the garage was a silver oval shaped something that was around 3ft high x 7ft long.   It zipped across the top of the garage with no sound!    We didnt know what to think of it!;40.4351;-84.0496
