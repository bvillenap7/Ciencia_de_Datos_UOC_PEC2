Witnessed silvery white cylinder travel across sky and then vanish.;2000-02-20 13:04:00;30secs/1min+;Witnessed silvery white cylinder travel across sky and then vanish. I am employed by the ((deleted)) Corporation as a HVAC service engineer and systems specialist with 35 years of feild experiance. The sky was bright and clear with high wispy clouds.I was on the roof ofOBliness Memorial Hospital in Athens Ohio working on a large water chiller.Out of the corner of my eye i noticed a silvery white object moving slowly across the sky directly overhead.At first I though it was a jumbo jet but on closer observation it was cynlindrical in shape.There were no wings,tail assembly,contrail or sound. At mid point on either side of the body was a half circle of light grey hase that was tranparent to the bright sky.A wedge shaped area of the same colored hase was at the posterior end of the cylinder.It was moving East to West in a dead straight line.I observed it for approximately 30 sscs. to 1 plus minutes across a 20 degrees arc of sky,horizon to horizon.I carry a small 6 in. pocket rule.While holding it at arms length above my head I measured the body at approximately 1 inch long.While taking this measurement the cylinder vanished!Its altitude could have been 3,000 to 6,000 feet. Not knowing the real length of the object makes it hard to judge its true height. Sincerly GENE BREWER (feild investigator in training) RUFOS of Circleville,Ohio.
