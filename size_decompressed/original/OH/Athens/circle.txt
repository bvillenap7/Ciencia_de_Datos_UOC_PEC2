I told her to look and it was gone. So, we sat on the deck and watched in same area and a few more showed up and faded just like before. I went and got my husband and he as well seen the same thing although they were generally in the same area they appered in different locations. They did not move just got brighter, lighter then faded away. Also, the next night we seen them again just not as many as the first night. There are no military bases and we live in the country. Has anyone else seen this before it's driving us crazy! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.3184000000001;-82.1012
