Early morning fireball-like light formation hovering near Akron/Canton Airport .;2010-07-29 05:00:00;45 MINUTES;Early morning fireball-like light formation hovering near Akron/Canton Airport . On the morning of 7/29/10 at 5:15am I was taking my dogs for a walk when I witnessed 4 fireball-like lights in the sky in the general vicinity of the Akron Canton airport (about 8 miles from my current location).  They were winking on and off intermittently (no rhythm to the intervals)  and appeared to be changing location slightly from their formation. They were just above the southern horizon in respect to my location which is in the Uniontown area just south of the Hartville flea market.. I proceeded to wake my wife up and she then witnessed the event. We watched the objects hover untilâ€™ about 6am, when they appeared to disappear over the horizon. In respect to our location, the lights were about the size of a burning cigarette tip held at arms length. They appeared to be moving very slowly to the south as we watched them. The entire elapsed time of the event was 45 minutes, although they were probably there longer (before I saw them).;40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191
