I was abducted and I lost time.;1987-06-30 15:00:00;5hours;I was abducted and I lost time. I was home and babysitting my two nephews. They were sleeping in the family livingroom.Well, I was up late this night. I was looking out the window facing our back yard. All the sudden, I see this beam flashing on and off over houses and trees. I was really afraid. But,I just watch as these lights flash on and off. It was as if they were searching lights. In a moment notice the light was over my house. It was than, I felt something touch my sides of my waist. The next thing, I woke up sitting upright on my couch the next morning. I dont remember walking over to the couch and I dont have any memory of the rest of the night. Plus I would never in a million years sleep that way. I was shock to see myself in this position it was almost like I was place there. In my heart, I know that I was abducted by a UFO. This is hard because unless it happen to you. It is hard for anyoe to beleive me. I know out in the world there are other like me who have lost time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

An unusual chase of two unidentified flying objects were seen in the sky.;2004-07-10 22:15:00;45 seconds to a minute.;An unusual chase of two unidentified flying objects were seen in the sky. A silent blinking aircraft travelling from the West, with a colorful light pattern as follows: 6-8 lights, blink, then 2-3 lights, blink, then 1-2 lights changed its course and followed a white light the size of a star.  Both objects then travelled Southwest to Northeast, keeping consistent distance from eachother.  Then after the two aircrafts were out of our visual range, a third object appeared travelling in the opposite direction. It was white in color, as small as a star, and was silent.  The object's light grew intense for about 4 seconds, then dimmed and continued its course.;40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191
vertical streams of light, one light began changing colors;2009-01-25 08:00:00;5-10 minutes;vertical streams of light, one light began changing colors Sky Sighting: January 25,2009 Time: Between 8:00-8:30 p.m. est Place: Canton, Ohio Stark county   Never saw anything like this in my life!  Pulled into my daughter’s driveway, looked to the south sky and saw streams of vertical lights.  Some were very prominent and others more faded. They covered quite a large area of sky space. The lights were shifting south-south east. One light began to show changing colors (we couldn’t believe what we were seeing) Colors were yellowish,orange, green (maybe a blue). Then they just disappeared. Unbelievable!  What was that?  I’ve seen Northern Lights in Canada and Wisconsin and this was nothing like that.;40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191
Ball of light with  illuminating light shining down at night sat still. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2009-09-19 20:00:00;45 sec.;A ball of light with  illuminating light shining down at night sat still then rised then just disappeared! N.E Ohio, Canton. My wife and I stopped over to my mother-in-laws to pick the kids up after dinner. Mother-in law was outside on the back patio with a couple of her girl friends deciding on where they were going out to eat. This was around 19:50. Being a very clear night sky. Facing south, I looked up and noticed a very bright star a little Southeast from where I was facing.  This was just a normal star. I got involved in some conversation and then again at about 20:00 I looked back at the same star just noticing how bright it was on the clear night. I then glanced over to the East. I then saw another bright light that was very high, and illuminating light downward.  (like the sun does when it shines through clouds). First, I thought it was another star, but as I watched it , it was weird since it was shining a very noticeable light down like the sun shining light through the clouds.  I just starred at it wondering what it was since the light shining down illuminated like the sun shining through clouds. Not knowing what it was. I grabbed the attention of my wife, mother-in-law and her friends, and my oldest son. I asked them what it was. There was no reply as everyone just starred at it. I would say about 30 sec. after I grabbed everyone’s attention, the light giving off the illuminating light started to rise, slow at first straight up. Then within a sec. the light and the light shining downward were gone!! You could actually see the ball of light and the illuminating light rise up.!!! THEN....There was no light anywhere!! It was gone within a sec. of moving up. We couldn’t even trace it. It was gone!  I then looked over at the star I was looking at earlier just trying to make sense of what I just witnessed. the original star was still there and didn't move.  We tried to reason with what we just saw. My Mother-in-law and wife who couldn't believe what we just saw, took the skeptic approach. Trying to reason by saying it could have been a jet since the Akron/Canton Airport is 10 miles from the house. However, We were able to compare a jet flying in the distance about 8 – 10 min. later. We all came to the same conclusion. What we saw was not a jet. The jet did not give off nearly as much light as the light we saw in the sky (actually, there is no comparison).  Plus the jet moved. The light we saw sat still for about 30sec. while we all were watching it, The jet was considerably smaller, and had flashing lights. The light we saw in the sky did not flash any lights. We had no answers to what we just witnessed. I would say the light location could have been I the area of Canto! n/Louisville/East Canton, Ohio. We still can't get over how the light was shining down, then just raised and disappeared with in a sec. The jet we saw later, we were able watch it’s path as it flew in the sky at night which appeared to be around the same distance and elevation., But the Light we all watched  just disappeared. I didn’t know who to contact in the area to report it. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191
Multiple red lights moving across the sky.;2013-01-05 18:30:00;few minutes;multiple red lights moving across the sky 15 (give or take a few) bright red lights moving across the night sky in what appeared to be a formation.  These lights seemed to have a flash of white and were very far away.  They moved very smoothly and vanished behind a cloudy part of the sky.  Three of these lights were in almost a perfect triangle.

4-5 bright white lights, shining downward, hovering in a group, then disappeared.;2013-09-03 21:00:00;15 minutes;4-5 bright white lights, shining downward, hovering in a group, then disappeared. My brother has a picture of these lights.  4-5 white lights hovering, bright lights shone downward.  Then disappeared.  They appeared round. He saw these out his living room window while watching television.  Got up and finally snapped pictures with his phone through the window.  He said they were toward my house, which would be south-east of his location.;40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191
Still then slow moving orb balls of light dripping sparks;2014-06-02 22:23:00;7-10 minutes;still then slow moving orb balls of light dripping sparks While visiting my mother at a nursing home we were sitting outside before dusk around 9 P.m.  I noticed 2 lights in the sky off to my left and it caught my attention because they  We're sitting still just above the tree line.  We were sitting outside on the nursing home patio.   I pointed it out to my mother and we watched the two lights as they became progressively smaller and disappeared into the clouds.  The 2 lights were white in colour and only small dots visually speaking from what appeared to be a good distance.   I didn't really give it much thought because the dots of light were not large or distinguishable.  However, when I left the nursing home at about 10:23pm I saw another orb of light coming from the opposite direction.  This light was very large and was a pinkish gold ball of light that was very intense.  There was sparks dripping falling off of the bottom of it. I surprisingly watched it as it went from right to left...slowing down and even coming to a full stop a few times at least.   The light was rich and brilliant deep pink/gold.  It looked like pure energy.  I wasn't as afraid as I was curious.  Visually it was the size of a baseball and it looked very close stopping in front of me even.  Never would have believed it...it had sparks falling straight down from the bottom as if liquid...so odd.   I have not stopped thinking about it since I saw it...  I wasn't afraid although I probably should have been...  I should have marked the date on the calendar but part of me just kinda kept shrugging it off as if since it made no sense I may as well not think of it...odd thought process I know.
