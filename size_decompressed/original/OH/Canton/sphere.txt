Odd hazey sphere apeared over the Akron/Canton area during sunrise.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch out of Wallops Island, VA.  PD));2006-12-16 07:10:00;20 minutes;Odd hazey sphere apeared over the Akron/Canton area during sunrise. My friends and I we're standing outside our high school waiting for a school bus. I saw a white smokey trail come out of the southern horizon quite a distance away from us. I would have to guess on the order of several miles or more. At first I thought it was some type of rocket lifting off, the zig zagging of the trail indicated that. The trail abruptly cut off after a few minutes of rising. Then a minute or so later a second trail appeared going up in the same way about a thumb width away from the first trail. The second one rose much higher. I measured it with my hand on its side, it went up a little more than the width of my hand then vanished. A few seconds passed, and another trail appeared above the trail that had just cut off. I assumed it was the same object, but I could see a glowing bright light at the tip unlike in the previous trails. The sun was up above the horizon and to my left. The bright light flew to the west for a few seconds and then stopped and stood still. A large haze started to come from the object, spreading out to make a sphere of haze that was by my guess a mile wide. This haze stood in the air for at least five minutes after the light had vanished. The trails had not dispersed when I had gotten on the bus and stopped looking. I looked at a clock, it had been twenty minutes.  There were about six of us there who all saw it. Two adults and four teenagers including myself. Later when we got to a speech tournament, my coach had talked to a coach from Akron (a full 30 miles away from Canton) whose students had also described to her an identical event.

Copper spherical object moving at great speeds;2008-05-05 18:55:00;12-15 mins;Copper spherical object moving at great speeds At about 6:55 pm on May 5, 2008, I was on the phone with my girlfriend, sitting outside.  I looked up at the sky and noticed something moving across the sky.  At this time of year, it is still daylight and there were big, cumulus clouds in the sky.  I thought at first it was a plane, because in profile, it looked to have wings of some sort, but it looked almost like an old bi-plane.  But there was no noise, and the object appeared to be too high to be a plane like that.  As I watched for the next ten to fifteen minutes, this object kept moving further and further away and also appeared to be climbing.  The only frame of reference I had for altitude and distance was when it passed in front of a smaller cumulus cloud (or perhaps through it, because this was the first time I almost lost the object.)  As it moved further away, it seemed to be more spherical than I first perceived, and was a copper color, because it glinted a little in the sunlight.  When it passed through or in front of the cloud, it looked like a black speck, but when it emerged, I could see the copper coloration again.  The only other thing that bothered me was that this object appeared to be fast-moving, because in those ten minutes, it moved in a seemingly pointed direction, all while climbing higher.  The other thing I thought strange was that there was no stream after the object, like a jet leaves.  I estimate the distance traveled at about ten to twenty miles in a matter of eight minutes or so.  I have no idea what the object was, could not see it in the viewfinder of my phone’s camera and lost the object shortly after 7:15 pm.;40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191
2 orange fireballs in Ohio.;2013-08-17 21:58:00;1.5 minutes;2 orange fireballs in Ohio. On Aug. 17, 2013, in Canton, Ohio, I was on my way home from my brother’s house at 9:45PM.  As I pulled into my neighborhood I saw 2 orange fireballs flying east side-by-side.  One of the orange balls made a complete u-turn and headed west.  I immediately pulled my car over and filmed the object.   This was at 9:58PM and I have 28 seconds of footage.  The only sound heard was from crickets.;40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191
I could only see one sphere while I was taking pictures but caught lots on video and pictures.;2013-12-28 04:00:00;20 minutes;I could only see one sphere while I was taking pictures but caught lots on video and pictures. I awoke to use the restroom at about 4:00 am.  I went into my kids room to turn off their tv and I went to close their window blinds, and I seen what I that was a bright star.  Then I noticed there where clouds behind the bright light.  As i noticed this it pulsed like strobe for just a couple of seconds, then it seemed like it went from a white light to a soft yellow..it was at a good distance from me but I could tell it was big.  I ran and grabbed my cell and started snapping pics as fast as my cell would let me.  I zoomed in as far as my phone would let me.  I could see what I thought where flashes and thought my eyes where just playing with me as I snapped away pics.  I could only see the bright object on the right as I pointed and aimed the camera.  It was not until I looked through the pics I seen the other spheres.  The big bright one does not move.  The others moved around it.  At one point it looked like they where flashing some kind of communication between each other.  I do not believe it is one object because the lights moved around as they flashed.  This is not my first time I have seen something like this.  I'm just thankful I had a camera this time.  At the end of the spheres flashing the bright one on the right is the last to leave, and it just kind of fades away.  I couldn't sleep the rest of the night and watched for it but I did not see it again.  I am sending everything I have.  I tried to hold it as steady as possible.  Any streaks of movement was from me I believe.  They did not move around. Just would flash and appear in a different spot.;40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191
I saw a small fuzzy gray sphere fly in the sky while taking a photo of the sunset.;2014-05-03 20:00:00;30 seconds;I saw a small fuzzy gray sphere fly in the sky while taking a photo of the sunset. I stopped my car to take a picture of the sunset through my windshield. While snapping the photo something fuzzy flew into the frame.  I thought it was a distant bird.  I took the photo anyway.  Upon examination of the picture I saw it wasn't a bird.  It was a gray sphere.  It looks like a water spot on the photograph.  There may be a 2nd one in the photograph, but it is hard to tell.  It may be part of the surrounding clouds.   After examining the photo, I looked back at the sky.  I did not see anything flying around. I usually look to the sky to see interesting cloud formations or large birds.   I do not have any background with ufo activity.;40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191
