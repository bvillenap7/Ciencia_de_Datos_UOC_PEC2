These lights formed a triangle with a red light in the center. These lights did NOT blink on or off. This light pattern was not any commercial aircraft that I have observed before. There were other aircraft in sight at a much lower elevation. The object traveled in a NNE to SSW path across the sky. The path took approximately 2 minutes to cross the visible sky.;40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191

Had just seen two airplanes flying high in the sky.   And after they were no longer visible to be seen i saw the triangular shape go across the sky.
