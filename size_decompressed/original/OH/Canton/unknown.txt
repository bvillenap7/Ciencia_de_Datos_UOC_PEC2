Lost time;1994-09-01 00:00:00;not sure;Lost time   It was around 1:00 to 2:00 in the morning.  I was babysitting my two nephews and I also had my baby in a playpen  All were sounded asleep. I could not sleep that night.  So I was downstair and as I was going to walk up the stairs to go into my upstair bedroom. I saw out the window a bright light going off and on. It was over other homes.  As it began to get closer this light or beam shining down on the ground. It continue to beam in a downward postion on and off.  As if it was in a searching moded.  I was very frighten by this light so I began to start to go upstair to tell my husband.  Than all the sudden, I felt two soft touch on both side of my waist.   After that I woke up the next morning.  In a sitting position on my downstair couch.  I had no knowledge how I got there or I never remember going to the couch.   To this day, I lost time.  I dont have any marks or burn on my body.  But, I know what I saw.  I also know that I cannot account for the rest of the night.  I would never have fell asleep on the couch in that postion.  I would have just went to bed. If anyone in ohio had a similar experience like this. I would love to hear from you. I hope your guys dont think am crazy.  But this really happen to me.  I wanted to report it because I never knew that this web site even existed.  Am glad that I have some place to tell my story.  Thank you;40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191

Small metallic object seen high in the sky for about 5 seconds and then disappeared.;2013-07-23 16:00:00;5 seconds;Small metallic object seen high in the sky for about 5 seconds and then disappeared. July 23rd, 2013 About one month ago in the afternoon, it was a clear day and some clouds in the sky in Canton, Ohio.  I saw a metallic, silverfish small object about 5000 ft in the sky and it was about 30 ft in volume.  It seemed stationary.   I was driving and saw it for about 5 seconds and then trees and buildings got in the way.   About 15 seconds later I could see the same sky area and no clouds, then it was gone.;40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191
Strange Atmospheric Destortion spotted in skies over Ohio or was it a UFO?;2017-06-12 01:30:00;15 seconds;Strange Atmospheric Destortion spotted in skies over Ohio or was it a UFO? Walking to the local grocery near me on a warm sunny day I happened to glance skyward something I do alot of,sky watching I noticed what I will say was an atmospheric anomaly there was what seemed to be a bow moving across the sky I could see through it and it seemed like a ripple on a lake.  Then as if due to the angle of it and the sunlight it  Disappeared.  Or maybe it was like a bubble.  Just weird I have seen other things but this was different could be nothing...?;40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191
