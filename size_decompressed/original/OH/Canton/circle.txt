What is that mirror like ball in the sky?;1990-05-15 13:35:00;10sec.;What is that mirror like ball in the sky? On the way home from work I traveled the expressway.And comming up over a rise in the road,I noticed a round cylindrical,metalic object that was smooyh and shiny! As I looked closer I noticed that there was what appeared to be rivets like that of skyscrappers use to hold girders together.Also that it had an orange/yellow color. When I went down the next hill to try and get closer for a better look it was gone. as Iapproached the area where I'd seen this thing I noticed that there were contruction vehicles parked in a field,backhoe's and things of that nature. All I could think was that whatever it was,was checking out our capability to construct large machinery. I mention to my family what I had seen and of course they thought me crazy! So when I found this site,decided to see if anyone else had seen anything like I had.Also I have to add that when it disappeared it happened so quickly like it kneww I was watching. I'm totally blown away by this incident,hopeing your organization can shed some like on this subject.;40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191
Spotted a large reflective metal sphere observing heavy equipment. What was it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;1994-06-16 15:00:00;08-seconds;Spotted a large reflective metal sphere observing heavy equipment. What was it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! On the way home from work spotted a round reflective object stationary in the sky about (30)ft above the ground. At first I thought that this was light reflecting off a truck, though because I could see color on the object from the distance I was and the clarity I dismissed that idea.The oddest thing was,the reflection was that of large machinery.ex..Backhoes,front-end loaders etc... I just wondered if anyone besides myself saw the samething I did on that summer day in my area or surrounding counties. I've wrestled with this information for sometime now for feeling of riddicule.Any info available would be apreciated. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191
The Metalic Orb that's as reflective as a mirror and moves like nothing I've ever seen;1994-07-01 16:00:00;2 minutes;The Metalic Orb that's as reflective as a mirror and moves like nothing I've ever seen This is just a simple attempt to gain some clarity of mind foremost. You see I live in Canton Ohio and in 1994 I'm driving East on Highway 30 around 4:00 pm, the same way I drove every day. I happen to pay close attention to the road and surroundings while driving. I notice something round and very shiny so much so that from a distance there looked like rivets (you know like in steel girders) I felt weirded out because my mind told me that wasn't possible, nothing we make is round that’s capable of flight! Also that there was a tractor supply just beyond or below what I was looking at so, I brushed it off. Then in August 2007 I was sitting with some friends (felt like kicking myself because I had no camera) there high in the sky I noticed something moving across the sky no flight trail and of the same description as before. What was really odd was imagine how much tome it takes for an Airplane to course across the sky this thing moved steadily and then disappeared behind the clouds. From ground level it appeared to be the size of a marble but when I saw the one in 1994 it was closer and seemed as big as a house. If there’s anyone else who may have seen the same thing in this area please let me know that way I won’t feel as though I've lost my mind. Thanks for taking the time to read this your time has been appreciated;40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191

Two bright orbs in sky. Flickering lights. No movement or sound .  ((Venus??));2020-04-09 21:00:00;1-2 hrs;Two bright orbs in sky. Flickering lights. No movement or sound . About 9:15 pm got up to the bathroom . Look out window saw a bright light.  It was to close to be a helicopter. I know what a life flight helicopter sounds like. No police Helicopter and no spot light.  No sound and was stationary in sky .  One was Northeast  the other was southeast higher in the sky.  Got my phone and recited it.  The light was a very white bright. It would flash off and on.  The two look identical in shape and size.  With my i- phone it looked round orb. But with the naked eye it appeared start like.  I could see other Star like Orion’s Belt. And Plants twinkling. But they were not as bright as these .   I watch for awhile. Then went back again and they were still there.  Got up again around 23:00 and they were gone.;40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191
