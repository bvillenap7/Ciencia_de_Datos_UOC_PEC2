Cigar shaped object seen in early afternoon by several witness for several min. in summer of 1976 or 1977.;1976-06-15 11:00:00;7 min;Cigar shaped object seen in early afternoon by several witness for several min. in summer of 1976 or 1977. The object appeared in the clear open sky above a softball field behind where we were living at the time.  I was it first and called out to my mother, brothers and sisters and a couple of neighbors to see the cigar/oblong shaped black/dark object just sitting still in the sky.  It was close enough that if it were a helicopter we would have heard the blades.  It preformed several fast short movements in different directions, returning to the same position.  Then it shot to the right and out of sight for several seconds and returned, the speed was to fast for a helicopter or a plane.  It stayed for only a couple of seconds more before it left and did not return.  At the time I was a teenager in highschool, my mom a wiatress.  I have not seen any other UFO's since. We are all sound of mind, no history of mental illness and above average intellegence (at least my family). ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD));40.8083511073255;-81.3835471039191
