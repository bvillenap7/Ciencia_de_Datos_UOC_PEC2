Saw lights on hovering craft at 0235 stopped car and listened/looked and there was no sound.;2006-07-07 02:35:00;10 mins;Saw lights on hovering craft at 0235 stopped car and listened/looked and there was no sound. I am a Registered ((deleted--medical)) Technologists (RVT) and take call at ((name deleted)) Hospital in Xenia on a rotation basis.   I was called in at 2:00 am to perform a ((deleted)) study on a patient with suspected ((deleted)). I live in Madeira, Ohio which is an hour away from the hospital.  The route I take is north on I-71 to the Route 73 exit, east about a quarter mile and then north on Route 380, which gors straight into Xenia.  At 0220 I was on 380 when I noticed two bright headlight appearing lights in the sky to the northeast of me.  I assumed it was a plane and continued driving.  A couple of minutes later I noticed the the lights appeared to be in the same place, not moving.  Again I assumed it was an optical trick and that the plane wass coming straight at me and that was why it looked like it was not moving.  After another couple of minutes I began to realize that this object was not movingg in the manner of a plane, if at all.  I slowed my car down to a stop and in deed the object was hovering about a half to a mile away.  Now I drove on toward it and and it remiained fairly stationary.  As I neared it appeared to be just above the treetops and the lights were very bright.   I stopped my car and looked at it sticking my head out of the window.  There was no engine noise and I could not make out a distinct shape because of the light and a foggy mist which enhanced the bright light effect, but my impression was it was long shaped  (?cigar vs cylinder). I was afraid to leave the car and was aware that I had a patient waiting for me in the ER. The craft then began to move to the southwest (behind me) at a slow rate of speed.   I could see anothers car light in my rearview mirror and I proceeded to Xenia. On my return trip I went the same way and saw nothing. That's it in a nutshell;39.6872999999998;-83.9383999999995
