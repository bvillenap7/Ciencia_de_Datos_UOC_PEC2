Wingless, tailess, Silver bullet/flared point tail 5000' 12 miles from WPAFB no movement no exhaust. ((anonymous report));2019-08-24 09:10:00;30 seconds;Wingless, tailess, Silver bullet/flared point tail 5000' 12 miles from WPAFB no movement no exhaust Was in my work vehicle heading south on us-42 when I noticed a silver object in the sky that appeared to resemble an airplane.  I then paid no attention to it until I was on the exit ramp from 42 to u.s. 35 East.  I glanced up at it and examined it a little further, I then noticed it hadn't moved anywhere for at least 30 seconds.  Upon further examination I noticed that I could see the nose of the object it was not conical it was round.  I then noticed that the area at the rear of the object was not tail shaped but had a black point that protruded in the opposite direction of the nose.  The sky was extremely clear at this moment I could see no other objects in the vicinity for referencpe.  This craft or object was at approximately 5000 feet altitude.  The object did not move if it did move then it moves slowly in relation to my vehicle traveling 65 miles per hour.  Unlike the speed of an airplane which exceeds the speed of a vehicle when the perspective is from the ! vehicle.  About a half mile down from the exit on 35, I then exited off the highway onto lower bellbrook road.  At this time I was not in sight of the object and was anxious to get around the curve of the exit ramp so that I could get another look at it by then I was pulling my phone out to take a picture.  Once I came to a stop sign I glanced back up in the sky where the object had been and it was no longer there.  It being an extremely clear sky I looked and looked for the object again.   There was absolutely nothing in the sky any longer. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.6872999999998;-83.9383999999995
