Downtown Xenia looking towards the Centerville area south west from Xenia.  During sunset, noticed a bright pink falling object, thought first it was a cloud but then noticed it descending. I watched the object for approxiametley 10 minutes as it fell.  Right before dropping below the skyline, another streak burst from right to left right before it disappeared before the skyline.  They looked almost close enough to collide within a minute of each other. I might have believed it a jet or plane, or Chen trails but the rate at which it was falling was not conducive to either scenarios. Even a downed plane would have fallen quicker.  First experience with something like this.  Will have to start looking up more.  Eyes to the skys. Perhaps the streak going horizontal was a jet fighter.;39.6872999999998;-83.9383999999995
