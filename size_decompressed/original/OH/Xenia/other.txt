Went outside to observe what it was, there was no sound coming from it, it stopped moving and I took a picture of it and then it vanished.   When you enlarge the photo it shows a round disc with a cylinder attached to a smaller disc.  The whole thing glows orange.;39.6872999999998;-83.9383999999995
