Fireball seen in Xenia Ohio July 4, 2012;2012-07-04 23:05:00;3;Fireball seen in Xenia Ohio July 4, 2012 My husband and I had just returned from watching a fireworks display in Kettering Ohio. I took my dog out to the back yard. I heard and saw my neighbors behind my house looking towards the south east firing off fireworks.   The rocket went off in the air, and as I looked I noticed a strange object just apparently hovering.   It moved slowly and silently from side to side.  It was rather large and looked like a fireball. It was red with some mixed colors in it of red, yellow and orange.  The colors seemed to be fluctuating. I tried to call my husband out to see it, but he didn't hear me.  My daughter came out with me and she saw it too as it slowly moved away from us to the south east.   It continued on until it disappeared from view. It was very controlled, moved slowly and made no sound at all.  Once it began to move away and seemed to disappear rather quickly.  The object was at just above the houses on the horizon.  There was little or no wind at the time.;39.6872999999998;-83.9383999999995

Erratic moving orange ball of light across the sky that completely stopped then disappeared.;2014-07-05 00:30:00;5 minutes;Erratic moving orange ball of light across the sky that completely stopped then disappeared. I was sitting on the back of my friend’s truck just talking when we saw a glowing orange ball of light directly above us heading south west.  This object was traveling very quickly and moving in an erratic pattern.  It was almost as if it was vibrating quite viciously. It continued to travel south west and would look as if it was slowing and speeding up.  The ball of light also started to dim a little as it traveled.  Once the object was about 35 degrees from the horizon, it slowed very rapidly and stopped completely.  It then started to dim at a more rapid pace as if it was moving away and then suddenly disappeared. We initially thought that it may be an airplane or a shooting star or a meteor but I’ve never seen any of those move in a pattern as this light was and then miraculously just stop for around 30 – 45 seconds.  We also thought about maybe a cloud got in the way but the sky was completely clear.;39.6872999999998;-83.9383999999995
