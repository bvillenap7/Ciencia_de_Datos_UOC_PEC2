Bright light/craft  with tail traveling s-ne;1999-11-16 19:05:00;1.5 min;Bright light/craft  with tail traveling s-ne Appeared from horizon/beind treeline,looked like rocket with spark tail.Traveled over highway for several minutes-went oner my truck,so I lost sight of-e-bound trucked said contiued another minute then went out. Approx size-half a dime at arms length-tail aprox 3 1/2 inches at same length-appeared tobe low,as both e and w-bound truckers could see at same time. First thught was missle/rocket-appeared MUCH slower than meteor,much bigger. Object was bright white light,not very defined. Tail was gold-color-looked like sparks,chemical reaction possibly. Many drivers saw it-noone could identify as meteor-said never saw anything like it.(Note: exact same spot,aprox three weeks ago,large,camo-painted hilocopter,bright lights on,shining on highway and trucks,circled highway,appeared to be landing behind trees-no known airport/military facility in area. I travel this road five days a week-never saw such activity before).;41.3878000000001;-84.1416000000001
