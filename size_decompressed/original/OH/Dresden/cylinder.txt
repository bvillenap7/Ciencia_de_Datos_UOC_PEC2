Flyling Cylinder Shaped Object Spotted Novenver 5, 2005 East of Dresden, Ohio;2005-11-05 13:30:00;30 seconds;Flyling Cylinder Shaped Object Spotted Novenver 5, 2005 East of Dresden, Ohio I was standing in a soybean field looking east. It was a beautiful dry fall day, puffy white clouds, bright blue sky. I was watching various airpanes and passenger jet planes pass over and under one another.  Then I looked up to the east at about 75 degrees about the horizon.  I was astonished to see a flying object, which at that moment, looked like a horizontal, silver beverage can, moving faster that the jets in a north by northwest direction.  I saw it for a few moments only before it quickly moved beyond eyesight a few seconds and into the clouds.  A few moments after the object moved off two dark, fast moving jets flew overhead moving east from the direction of Columbus, Ohio.  It surprised me because it looked like a large flying soda can.  It must have been quite large as it was so obviously out of place, by that I mean the sense of seeing it up in the clouds for a moment was like a cartoon effect.  I have no idea how many miles away it was from where I stood, but seeing it again in my memory it must have been enormous.;40.1082;-82.0033
