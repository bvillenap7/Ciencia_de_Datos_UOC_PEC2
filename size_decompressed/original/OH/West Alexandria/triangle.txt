TRIANGULAR CRAFT NEAR WRIGHT PATTERSON AFB, WINTER 1992;1992-02-15 20:00:00;30min;TRIANGULAR CRAFT NEAR WRIGHT PATTERSON AFB, WINTER 1992 THE WINTER OF 1992 I WAS A BOEING SUPPLIER REP STATIONED IN CHICAGO, WORKING IN THE DAYTON OHIO AREA. WHEN IN DAYTON I STAYED AT MY FATHER'S FARM ON PREBLE COUNT LINE RD. WHEN RETURNING TO THE FARM FROM DAYTON ONE NIGHT A BRIGHT LIGHT PACED ME TO THE SOUTH OF LITTLE RICHMOND RD. THE NIGHT WAS COLD AND CLEAR. I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH AIRPLANES AND THE FAA REQUIRED LIGHTS, AND THIS WAS ONE BRIGHT YELLOW/WHITE LIGHT, WITHOUT THE USUAL RED/GREEN WING LIGHTS, MOVING TOO SLOWLY TO BE AN AIRPLANE. UPON ARRIVING AT THE FARM I GOT OUT OF MY CAR AND LOOKED FOR THE LIGHT AND SAW A STIRING OF MAYBE SIX REDDISH LIGHTS COMING FROM THE SOUTHWEST DIRECTLY OVER MY FATHER'S FARM, AS THEY CAME CLOSER THE LIGHTS CHANGED FROM REDDISH TO WHITE. I ASKED MY FATHER FOR HIS VIDEO CAMERA, BUT WHEN HE BROUGHT IT OUTSIDE IT WOULDN'T OPERATE. THE CRAFT MOVED SLOWLY OVER THE FARM, AND ONE OF THEM WAS SO LOW I COULD SEE A FEATURELESS TRIANGULAR STRUCTURE RIMMED WITH SEVERAL LIGHTS (MUCH LIKE THE ONE ON YOUR SITE). AS IT WENT OVER I HEARD A SOUND LIKE THE SOUND OF UFOS IN MOVIES, A VARIABLE HIGH TONED DYNAMO HUM. THE CRAFT PROCEEDED TO THE EAST/NORTHEAST, TOWARD THE WRIGHT PATTERSON AFB AREA. AFTER THEY MOVED OFF I LOOKED AROUND AND SAW A YELLOWISH WHITE LIGHT WITHOUT RED/GREEN WINGTIP LIGHTS HOVERING DUE WEST AT AN UNDETERMINED DISTANCE. IT HOVERED FOR SOME TIME (MAYBE FIFTEEN MINUTES) THEN MOVED EASTWARD AND RAPIDLY UPWARD WITH NO NOISE, AS (APPARENTLY) A FIGHTER JET ON AFTERBURNERS BEGAN PURSUING IT, BUT EITHER COULDN'T OR WOULDN'T CATCH UP WITH IT. BY THAT TIME I WAS FREEZING MY COJONES OFF, SO I WENT INSIDE FOR THE NIGHT. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.7258;-84.5341
