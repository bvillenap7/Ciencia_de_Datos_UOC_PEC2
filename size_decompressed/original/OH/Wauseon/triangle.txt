Something over Northwest Ohio;2006-04-10 10:45:00;30 minutes +;Something over Northwest Ohio I saw a bright white light in the sky and watched it for a few minutes, it was a solid light, no blinking, nothing.  The person driving a pick-up in front of me saw it too, they almost came to a stop when it crossed right over us.  It was shaped like a triangle and had just a pink glow underneath.  Now, I am not a crazy person and never saw anything like this before.  I am curious to see if anybody else saw it.  I am not good with directions but the direction it was going and that would have taken it Southeast headed towards Perrysburg/Bowling Green?  I called my husband, I wanted him to go outside and see what he could see because it was headed that way and when it passed over the phone was losing it's connection and it doesn't lose it in that area.;41.5667000000001;-84.1571000000002
