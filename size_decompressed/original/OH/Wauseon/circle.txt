I was driving to my parents’ house from my apartment in Toledo on April 11, 2008, Friday.  Driving home from Toledo, it was approximately 9:30 on a clear night, this was just tonight.  I was looking up at the stars, out in the country with almost no lights around, and there were almost no clouds in the sky.  I saw one star and it appeared slightly redder than the others, so I looked at it wondering if it perhaps was Mars.  Well it wasn’t a planet... it was moving at what appeared to be the speed of an airplane.  I looked closer and noticed that it wasn’t flashing any lights as a normal airplane would so I kept looking at it. I decided to look until I couldn’t see it anymore.  It was moving left in the sky, passing the stars, and abruptly it got smaller and smaller until I couldn’t see it anymore. As it got smaller, it also got redder, until it just disappeared.  Something else I must mention is the fact that when I first noticed what I thought was a star, it wasn’t moving.  I looked at it for about ten seconds, it abruptly started moving for about 20 seconds, then faded away.;41.5667000000001;-84.1571000000002
