It was falling slowly, leaving a trail behind it.  As it continued its vertical decent it separated--appearing to explode--into 3-4 smaller fragments, then fizzled out.   Seconds later, it appeared as 3 separate lights and traveled in a triangular formation.  Again these lights, now as individual circular ones, seemed to disappear and seconds later appeared again but now there was a fourth one.  The lights continued their decent into the western sky.  Several of us captured photos on our phones until they were too far away to see.;39.5627000000003;-84.2223999999996
