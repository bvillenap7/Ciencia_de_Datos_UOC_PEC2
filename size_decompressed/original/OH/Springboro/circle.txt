No blinking lights, went from dim to bright to unlit;2013-07-08 22:00:00;4 minutes;No blinking lights, went from dim to bright to unlit Single yellow reddish light initially appealing with brightness as a star would in the western sky.  It was moving left to right (west to north) and the brightness increased as it moved toward the northwest sky.  Movement was linear, as a plane would, but without any blinking lights.  Elevation was about 20degrees from the horizon.   As it moved toward the northwest sky, the brightness decreased until it went black and was only visible as a black unlit object faintly visible against the dimly lit horizon.   Object strangely disappeared over the local tree line unlike every plane I have ever seen here.   Also the lack of blinking lights was very unusual.;39.5627000000003;-84.2223999999996
3 bright yellow lights moving independently, disappearing and reappearing in western sky of SW OHIO;2013-09-29 18:58:00;3 minutes;3 bright yellow lights moving independently, disappearing and reappearing in western sky of SW OHIO Upon pulling into my driveway I saw 3 bright odd lights in the western sky about 20degrees up from the horizon.  They went behind a neighbors house as I pulled in obstructing my view.  I got my phone and went to the backyard where I saw them moving independent of each other.  One of the lights disappeared, then reappeared.  A single light then disappeared, leaving two, then another disappeared, leaving one, then the last one disappeared.   They were constantly moving left and right, not in straight lines, and trended toward the horizon.  When I initially saw them, they looked to leave tails behind them when moving, but this could not be appreciated in the video i took with my phone.  Fortunately in the video there is one stationary light closest to the bottom of the screen, that light is a porch light from a neighbors house about 800 yards away.  Its character is notably different from the lights moving in the sky and would serve as a good point of reference. ! I could submit my video if someone wants to see it.  This is the second time I have seen something strange in the western sky from where I live over the past 4 months, though this event was quite different from the last one.;39.5627000000003;-84.2223999999996
