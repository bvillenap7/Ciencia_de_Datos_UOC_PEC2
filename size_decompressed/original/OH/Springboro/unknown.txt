Glowing orbs flickering and changing configuration.;2013-10-12 21:00:00;<1 minute;Glowing orbs flickering and changing configuration. I was exiting I-71 at St Rt 741 when I saw a glowing orb in the distance to my northwest approximately a half mile away tward the beach water park .  It flickered then re appeared as three orbs in a triangle shape.   They then disappeared and re appeared in a different configuration this time 4 orbs oriented in a straight line.   I tried to follow with my car but it disappeared over the tree line.  The entire sighting lasted less than a minute.   I saw this same thing in the sky Thursday night.  On lyttle five points road in springboro   Both times I had a witness with me.  Both times it seemed to be moving slow in a northern progression.;39.5627000000003;-84.2223999999996
High altitude orb of ligh breaks into four, which move around laterally, join back together and disappear.;2013-10-12 21:45:00;30 seconds;High altitude orb of ligh breaks into four, which move around laterally, join back together and disappear. My friend and I were outside talking when an organge/red light started falling from a high altitude.  It looked like a firework burning out.   We watched it decend and it broke into 3 equally spaced orbs and kept decending.  I assumed it was just breaking apart as it decended.   Then the orbs stopped decending and hovered.  They began blinking on/off randomly.  Then there were 4.   They then began moving around laterally.  This kept up for a few seconds.   Suddenly they all came back together and then disappeared (essentially went out).   Prior to this occurance, my friend his wife and another person said they had seen the largest falling star they had ever seen.  Unfortunately, I did not witness this because I was looking in the other direction.;39.5627000000003;-84.2223999999996
