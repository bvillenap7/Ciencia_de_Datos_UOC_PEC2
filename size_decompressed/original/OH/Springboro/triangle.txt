Bright light turns into three lights and a triangle shape craft;2011-12-03 18:30:00;3-4 minutes;Bright light turns into three lights and a triangle shape craft While walking my dogs early this evening I noticed a bright light in the western sky looked somewhat big.   As I keep walking the light was getting bigger coming towards me and broke into three different lights then stopped in the sky as it looked as if it was hovering.  As I was walking towards it I could make out what looked like a triangle shaped craft.  It looked as if it was hovering over Interstate 75 between Springboro and Franklin Ohio.  A police officer was driving in the parking lot in front of me kind of slow I wanted to talk with him to ask if he seen the objet hovering but he left before I could make it to him. I walk home very quickly to get family members to drive back to see the object and it was gone within 10 minutes.
