PD));2010-07-16 21:50:00;8 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to Jim Strausbaugh, MUFON FI ID 12701, for sharing the benefit of his investigation into this matter with NUFORC.  PD)) 4 lights over Springboro, OH July 16, 2010 @ 9:45 pm Last night I was standing in my driveway looking towards West around 9:40 looking at Venus when there was somthing falling from the sky - I thought it was a metor as it was too large for a shooting star - it was very bright and was vertical.    All of sudden it rapidly split from one large light which was vertical with a tail into 4 seperate lights splitting horizontally in the sky.  The lights separated for about 15/20 seconds then came back together into 1 light, then split again into 4 lights coming in and out of the clouds.  The entire event lasted about 7 minutes or so and the light disappeared one by one. My husband saw the lights when they were split and going away one by one.  I ran into the house to get the camera to try and take a picture buy only caught one of the lights before they faded away and couldn't see them anymore.   I thought it was a metor at first until it split into 4 separate lights - 2 split horizontally left and 2 went right - it was the most amazing event I've ever seen - unbelievable doesn't describe what I saw.
