Unknown craft on the waters at Lake Erie;1986-06-01 01:00:00;20 mins;Unknown craft on the waters at Lake Erie It was a summer month in 1986, when a friend and I were strolling along our local beach when suddenly along the horizon, I noticed a bright white light, moving horizontal along the horizon at very high rate of speed. The Lake (Erie) was calm almost like a sheet of glass It was late at night, and there were no other craft (boats or planes) in the water or air. As we both watched the object move, it appeared to have stopped almost like it knew we were watching it. It then appeared to have stopped moving in that direction (west to east) and it appeared stationary however a few moments later, the craft which I will say had a hull of a hover craft and a canopy of a stealth fighter, was hovering about 5 to 10 feet above the water, at a distance of 100 feet. It had white lights around the perimeter of the hull and made a horrific constant sound that I cannot even describe. We watched the craft from what I can remember at this point, for only a few minutes. The last thing we both remember from there is we were at the top of the cliff, where our car was parked. My friend and I lost contact for several years until recently we ran into each other when we were working downtown. We met for lunch, and believe it or not, this event was the only thing we talked about. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1986 is approximate.  PD));41.6055637681159;-81.5012101449274

I decided to take my dog and telescope down by the rocks on lake erie. I then set my telescope up and began filming the horizon. I eventually came across something I thought was a refinery but now know its a huge rock with trees growing from it. So as im filming a square like object with rounded edges appears. It was moving around the speed of a boat maybe faster but it seemed to glide effortlessly about 10 to 15 feet above the water. The square had a dark outline in a cube shape but with rounded edges and was see through except the edges that outlined it. When it passed in front of the rock the outline seemed to darken as if the outlines were transparent or something. It hovered past the rock and about a mile further then eventually faded into the horizon.;41.6055637681159;-81.5012101449274
