BRIGHT white light, stationary for over a minute, then moves the north slowly accelerating then speeds up and winks out....;2001-08-13 22:30:00;2 minutes;BRIGHT white light, stationary for over a minute, then moves the north slowly accelerating then speeds up and winks out.... On the 8/13 I went out to my patio at about 9:30pm for some air and noticed nothing wrong, an hour later I went out at 10:30pm and saw this bright light almost straight above me, it was like if you were to take a street light and squeeze it down to the size of a star but with the same brightness of a street light is what it looked like.  I've been an amateur astronomer for 15 years and was in the Air Force stationed at a SAC base for 4 years so I know what aircraft look like in flight, my immediate first thought was this is a Super-Nova I'm seeing.  I was astonished, visual supernovas are so rare I thought I was a lucky person to actually witness one...well after watching it for over a minute I noticed it started to move VERY slowly to the north against the background stars.  Well that night if you check the weather records in my area we had wind gusts of 22mph going southeast so this object would be going AGAINST the wind.  Well it sped up and winked out....if I were to hold out my fists in front of me I'd say it went from a stand still to disappearance within 6 fist-sizes, also I don't have any Idea of how big it was I just have the impression it was up incredibly high, I heard no noise and saw no shape, just that incredibly bright light....and I know about the perseids, this wasnt a fireball or anything of the sort, and it isn't a planet since there isnt any planet that would appear at the zenith let alone any bright ones like venus or jupiter... it's EXACTLY like I said, it was stationary for over a minute then slowly accelerated then winked out heading north...... ((NUFORC Note:  Had the lights been close to the horizon, as viewed from the vantage point of the witness, we would first have suspected that he might have been looking at the landing lights of approaching aircraft.  However, given that they apparently were overhead, that possibility appears to be quite remote.  We do not know what the witness observed.  PD));41.6055637681159;-81.5012101449274

Circular White Light;2004-06-22 23:14:00;10 seconds;I am an intermediate astronomer. It was partly cloudy, so I went out to have a look at Jupiter (no telescope). I saw what I will call a circular white light, from arms length about the size of a pea, appear from behind a cloud about 34 degrees above the horizon. It traveled in a straight line heading North for about 10 seconds then it simply disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  No Iridium-satellite flares are indicated for the place, time, and date that the witness indicates.  Also, any satellite headed north at this time of year should not fade, since it is flying toward the Sun.  We do not know what the witness observed.  PD));41.6055637681159;-81.5012101449274
Seen over Route 2 freeway and when he acknowledged it seem to swoop down at his vehicle.;2012-11-06 18:30:00;few seconds;Seen over Route 2 freeway and when he acknowledged it seem to swoop down at his vehicle. My brother was driving down route 2 west when he looked up and seen a light which to him looked like a missile because of how fast it was moving and then when he looked up at it on the freeway it swooped down at him turning his truck off and blinded him for several minutes then sped off at a high rate of speed.;41.6055637681159;-81.5012101449274
