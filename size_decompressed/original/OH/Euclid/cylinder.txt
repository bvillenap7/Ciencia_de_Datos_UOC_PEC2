Cylindrical - shaped object, with multiple lights and one red beacon light;2002-05-21 18:30:00;15 seconds;Cylindrical - shaped object, with multiple lights and one red beacon light I was outside looking at the sky as I usually do on a clear night when I noticed a group of lights high in the southern sky which appeared out of nowhere. I first thought it was a meteor breaking up into smaller pieces, but quickly noticed it was moving to the east as one unit. It had approximately 6 whitish/yellow lights with one pulsating red light on the bottom center of the main body. I thought I saw several wings or arms protruding from the main body. And I also noticed as it was leaving, it looked like a single white/blue exhaust from the rear of the object. It made a constant humming sound as it moved. It did not have the sound of a jet, plane or helicopter. I was unable to distinguish it more than that. Just before I noticed the object, a car alarm sounded and dogs began to bark.;41.6055637681159;-81.5012101449274
