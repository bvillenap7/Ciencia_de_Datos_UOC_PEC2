I then sat on the side of my house, which my house is about a 2 minute walk to lake erie.  I was sitting there for approximately 3 minutes, when I saw a glowing red blinking light (it blinked from red to white)(then would be a solid red and start blinking again) hover higher into the air, and as I was trying to figure out what this light was another one appeared in the same maner as the first one did, they both stoped at the same point in the sky and then the second object I saw, started to disappear very rapidely, into the sky.. The first stayed in the same place for about 30 seconds and disappeared into the sky slower then the first one did. You could still see the first one for a few extra seconds.. Then I did not experence anything after that;41.6055637681159;-81.5012101449274
I've never seen anything like that before.;2012-07-13 10:30:00;5 minutes;I've never seen anything like that before. I was outside with my brother when he stood up and saw these lights coming from south to east in the field across from our house where an old church use to be.  They had bright lights and we could tell they were circular and plenty of them.  Then after a little, they disappeared.;41.6055637681159;-81.5012101449274
