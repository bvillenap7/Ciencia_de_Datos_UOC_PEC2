UFO Hoovered over home;2003-07-20 01:00:00;5 minutes;UFO Hoovered over home 4 of us were out swimming in our pool and my brother saw a light in the sky that looked odd.  It was off in the distance and I said it's nothing, but a plane.  About 2 minutes later we looked back and it was coming up over the house.   We looked at it and it stopped and hoovered of our house may 10 feet above it.  We could almost see it in perfect detail.  It was triagular and had a rounded feature that reminded you somewhat of the millinum falcon from Star Wars.  It Didn't make any noise what so ever.  I hoovered there the whole time we were in the pool. It freaked us out and we jumped out of the pool and ran in the house. We went to get another person to see it and by the time we got back outside (no longer than 2 minutes) It was clear across the sky.
