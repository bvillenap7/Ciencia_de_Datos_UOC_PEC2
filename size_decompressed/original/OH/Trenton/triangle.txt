3 orange lights;2009-05-23 20:00:00;10-15min;3 orange lights Mother and I looking south east from front porch towards the Cincinnati/Mason area. 3 lights being still then 1 or 2 moving slowly as it was turning always staying the shape of a triangle then one would fade out then another then another until it was gone, we thought it was over then they would all fade back on one at a time. When they did they were lower in the horizon and continued for a 10-15 minutes slowly turning and going in and out until it was not visible due to a tree line several miles away. Overcast skies but the objects were still on the black of the skies.;39.4751;-84.4612
