I saw a blinking light crossing the sky going east towards Trenton, Ohio.  Decided to watch it.  A bright glowing orb appeared after I lost track of that.  The orb split into two or maybe three smaller ones, then disappeared. I wouldn't think think anything of this, passing it off as nighttime skydiving or something.  There's an airport in that general direction.   However, a few months back I saw some orbs of the same color going North and ascending at roughly a 45 degree angle that were the same color as the ones I saw today.;39.4751;-84.4612
