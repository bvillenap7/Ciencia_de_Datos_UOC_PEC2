I was standing at my back porch to smoke a late night cigarette, when a stream of light appeared out of no where int the sky.  It was far too low to be a shooting star, but that is the best way I can describe what I saw.  However, what was strange about this was rather than fade out, like most shooting stars I've seen, this ended with a bright burst of light, like a bright flash, and then vanished. the streamed of light from the burst were mainly horizontal ...  The rays were distinct in direction rather than dispersed.  The light was a very pale blue color.;39.4751;-84.4612
