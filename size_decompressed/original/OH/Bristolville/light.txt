Some friends and I were standing in the yard when out on the horizon we saw 3 orange lights progressing toward us.  Soon the 3 were followed by many more, up to at least 6.  Four of these lights arranged themselves in a diamond figure and hovered in the sky for around 3 minutes before most of the lights vanished.  Out on the horizon we could see faint orange flashes as more of the lights appeared and started advancing towards us before once again stopping and forming a crude “X” shape for about another 3 minutes.  These shapes soon vanished also but this time one remained. More lights and flashes were observed and another pattern was formed.  All the lights but one vanished.  This light remained stationary for about 5 minutes before disappearing.  There were aircraft in the air at the time but these lights were not anything remotely like a jet plane or helicopter.;41.3833;-80.8543

Stopped in one spot for 15 or so minutes while a plane with red blinking light flew around it from distant as in observing it.  I grabbed my dad and he wasn't to interested but my sister watched with me then it was gone, just vanished or turned lights off or something.  Lately I have been feeling unusual. We have little video.  You can barely see it but it is there.;41.3833;-80.8543
