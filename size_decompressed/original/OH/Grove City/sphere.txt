Red pulsing orb moving silently across the sky.;2015-07-29 21:48:00;5 minutes;Red pulsing orb moving silently across the sky. Went outside to put the trash out.  Spotted a light in the western sky.  I am a former Army helicopter crewchief!, so I immediately recognize the light pattern was nothing I had ever seen before. It seemed to have a reddish Corona and a white center.  It was pulsing and moving slowly to the northeast.  It sort of swayed left and right, as it moved forward.   I went inside and asked my wife to come out and validate what I was seeing. By the time we got back out, it was moving north.  Then, suddenly,  it faded and disappeared.;39.8797999999997;-83.088300000001
