White lights over Grove City, Ohio;2013-07-06 21:50:00;1-2 minutes;White lights over Grove City, Ohio Seen to the east of Grove City, Ohio.  Three bright white lights suddenly appeared and slowly lowered to the ground with a sparkling trail behind them.  A few seconds later, in the area of the lights we observed three lights which held in place.  They were in a trianglar shape which eventually appeared to rotate.  Not falling nor rising.  The lights moved into line with each other and a fourth light appeared.  The lights stayed in a steady straight line.  All evenly spaced apart.  After about 10-15 seconds the lights appeared to move closer to the ground.  Trees blocked any further viewing.  During this event the lights stayed bright white and steady.  No fading or flashing.;39.8797999999997;-83.088300000001
