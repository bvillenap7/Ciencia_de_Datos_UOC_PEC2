It was approximately 10 stories above the road. One formation of white lights were witnessed above the road I was traveling on (Richard Ave). I also saw at least one red light flashing on the side of it. I was heading south at the time, and it was directly ahead of me, roughly 10 stories above the road. I could see it above the trees (which line both sides of street) from far down the road. I could have stopped right in front of it, but I decided to turn left (east) on Columbus Street, go down a ways, then turn around, and observe it from farther away. When I got turned around, it was much farther off, and almost straight ahead (west) on Columbus. I then went to my nearby house, and observed it out my back window (west) for at least 45 minutes. It moved very slowly, but stayed roughly in the same spot-no sudden movements. I did observe another craft in the area that went past it-had flashing white light I believe-not sure if it was another, or an airplane. By the time Grove City police arrived, it was far in the distance, but still visable. One officer blew it off completely, while the other said, I see what you're talking about, and mentioned the red light (which I hadnt even mentioned yet). I would like to be contacted to discuss this further. Thank you....Jim;39.8797999999997;-83.088300000001
V shaped object, or grouping of objects, flying low - completely silent - no lights.;2011-11-07 23:15:00;3 - 5 seconds;V shaped object, or grouping of objects, flying low - completely silent - no lights. Monday, November 7, 2011 at approximately 11:00 or 11:30 PM I was out in the yard walking my puppy when I saw a shadow on the ground.  The dog saw it too and we both looked up to see a very large object, or group of objects, overhead.  It was very similar to a flock of geese, but the V was inverted as it was moving forward, and one leg of the V was curved.   It felt to be fairly low in the sky.  I could see individual darker objects, evenly spaced, which made up the V or were positioned along the perimeter and no lights.   There were no wings flapping or noise, and if it had been geese the size of the dark objects would have allowed me to see necks and wings.  It was moving very quickly overhead.   It disappeared before you would have reasonably expected to no longer be able to see it.   It was a very unusual sighting, unlike anything I have ever seen before.;39.8797999999997;-83.088300000001
