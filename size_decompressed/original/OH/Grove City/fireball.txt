Orange lights above Grove City, Ohio.;2014-02-26 19:40:00;~1 minute;Orange lights above Grove City, Ohio. Driving south on Kropp Road, south of Batelle Darby Creek Metro Park, we observed 4 orange lights in the southern sky.   These lights changed position a few times, going from 4 to 6 in no particular formation, to 3 in a horizontal row, to 4 or 5 in no particular formation, to 3 in a triangle, then to 4 or 5 again until they completely disappeared.   This is our second sighting of similar objects in this area.  I submitted report on 7-6-13 regarding that sighting.;39.8797999999997;-83.088300000001

One lit up slowly then another just off to the right of it lit up while the first faded. then the second faded and the process repeated about four or five times.  The lights stayed lit for erratic periods from 1 to 3 seconds.   I got my cell phone and turned on the video camera then about 45 seconds into the video the same lights appeared again farther off to the west about the same altitude and for about the same duration.   I got off the highway at Georgesville rd and parked in a parking lot and got out waiting for about 5 minutes for another sighting.  But with no luck.  So I got back in my truck and travelled south on Holt Rd. and pulled into my neighborhood, stopped at the stop sign facing west and saw the exact same lights do the same thing again, but this time much closer.  At this point I realized the lights were just south of Bolton Field Airport, but very high in the sky.   I went out onto my porch several times looking west and about 15 minutes from the last sighting me and the woman that lives with me saw a group of 3 to four tiny flickering lights that appeared to be travelling north and over the Bolton Field Airport.  My line of sight was from my back porch facing west and the lights appeared just above my neighbors house that is about 60 feet behind mine roof line.  We watched them for about 6 or 8 seconds before we lost sight.  They were flickering and travelling very slowly.   We got into the car and left and took a country ride to see if we saw the lights again, with no luck.  But after returning home I went back to the porch and a little higher in the sky in the same general area I looked at the stars and saw a white light and htne if lowly went out.  I watched and witnessed this light lower itself in the sky and repeated to light up about every 6 or 8 seconds it seemed several times before it stopped.  We have seen numerous strange lights in the past few years around Columbus including a very large red triangle ufo that lit up through the clouds over the south end of Hilliard, Ohio, in the evening of February of 2016 that lit up twice for about a second or two, but was massive, probably being a mile or so away and hundreds of yards wide.  As well as two separate instances on opposite sides of the city in the distant southern skies were we saw a short string of large orange fiery lights, 5 or 6 fire orange colored lights lighting up at the same time that were very clos to being linked to each other like a small lego, then slowly dissipated within a few seconds, then light up another 1 to two times and disappear. The first time I saw these lights there was another small light off to the side in the distance light up when these light starting going out. I was in Reynoldsburg, OH in November 2016 facing south on this first occasions. And in Kouisville, OH, southwest of Columbus,! Ohio in February 2017 the second time. On the second occasion we  parked and filmed a 14 minute video (but didnt capture those big orange lights ) which we submitted to MUFON that contained several minutes of dozens of sporadic red and white lights  spread across portions of the sky flickering.  We later realized we also captured a very clear image of bright white UFO with what appeared to have a small spout shaped extension extending off to the right and downward to the bottom right corner of it.  Though the camera remained steady focused on a triangle of three bright white stars, this ufo looking object clearly travels up the left side of the screen from bottom to top for about 4 seconds .;39.8797999999997;-83.088300000001

The light hovered for about 2 minutes in the same slot and then very slowly began to move below the tree line.;39.8797999999997;-83.088300000001
