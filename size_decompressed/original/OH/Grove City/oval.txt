Looked ;1999-08-18 21:10:00;10 minutes;2 oval shaped objects with 3 jets following for about 10 minutes, then there was 12 black helicopters flying in same direction. Looked like the copters were looking for something on ground. I was driving north bond on state route 62 towards Columbus, Ohio, when my five year old girl spotted the jets. looking out the window at the jets, my wife and I noticed they were following two oval shaped obects that were flying very low (maybe 500 feet). we could see all this for about ten minutes before they got out of our site. Then maybe about 3 to 5 minutes there were black helicopters everywhere (12 total) looked as though they were searching for something on the ground, because they were sweeping the area that they were covering a couple of times before moving further north. This all took place a bout 1 mile south of Grove City, Ohio. Got home and turned on scanner, but did not hear any reports. Did call local police deptand they said the black helicopters were on a training patrol.;39.8797999999997;-83.088300000001
