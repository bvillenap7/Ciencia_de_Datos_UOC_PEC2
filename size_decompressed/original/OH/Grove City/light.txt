We were listening to the Beach Boys concert at a nearby park and at least fifteen airplanes crossed the sky as usual with the normal sound of jets accompanying them.  All of a sudden, a very bright light crossed the sky ten times the speed of any aircraft I have ever experienced, stopped in midair for five seconds, and shot off in a completely different direction.  I sat speechless for a few seconds.  My husband finally said, Did you see that?  and I said, I think we just saw a UFO.  He has been talking about it ever since.  I waited so long to post this in the hopes that someone else saw the same thing.  Like it or not, there is a stigma attatched to this type of phenomenon.  I have been interested in ariel phenomena for years, have been granted a scholarship for astronomy and have attended the NASA space camp.  I have always believed that there is more than meets the eye, but have never experienced it in recent years until now.;39.8797999999997;-83.088300000001
