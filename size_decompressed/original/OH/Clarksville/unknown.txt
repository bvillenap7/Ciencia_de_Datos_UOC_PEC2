Bright Lights in the Eastern Sky.;2012-12-05 18:46:00;2 minutes;Bright Lights in the Eastern Sky My wife and I were driving East on Settlemeyer Rd about 2000 feet from Ward Koebel Rd. Warren County Ohio.    We noticed a bright yellowish light just above the tree line in front of us, then that light disappeared and then reappeared just to the left.  Then there was a second and a third and a forth.  The lights were in a straight line equal distances apart.  Then the first one on the right went out, then the second, then the third and then they were all gone.  While they were lit they appeared to be moving left to right.;39.4038;-83.958
