Flashes flying through air;2008-03-24 20:40:00;20 sec;Flashes flying through air One clear evening night, my dad and I were walking outside of the gas station.  I looked up at the dark starry sky, and saw two sudden flashes zoom past the sky.  They were flying at speeds above my knowledge faster than any airplane I have ever saw.
