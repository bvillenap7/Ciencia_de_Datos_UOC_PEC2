We thought it was maybe a blimp or drone, but I took pictures and each picture showed a different shape with an aura or orb glowing surrounding the object with bright lights flashes periodically.  It appears to be floating in the sky.   The sun was on the right side of the object, therefore, there should be a shadow on the left but there was bright lights instead.   The object appears to be black metallic and silver when you zoom in on the picture.  The video showed spontaneous flashes of light.   We turned the corner and looked up and it was gone.;40.3916;-84.3835
