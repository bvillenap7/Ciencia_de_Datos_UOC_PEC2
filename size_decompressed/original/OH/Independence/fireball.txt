It moved in a straight line covering our field of view in about 1.5 minutes.   Object made no sound and did not change in intensity, as one would expect if it were reflecting sunlight.   Wondering if anyone else saw this also. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));41.377;-81.6588000000001
