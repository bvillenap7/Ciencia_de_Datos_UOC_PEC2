15-20 red circular lights moving perfectly horizantal with change in vertical direction.;2014-07-03 23:00:00;10 minutes;15-20 red circular lights moving perfectly horizantal with change in vertical direction About 1 hour after the city's fireworks display, I noticed 15-20 red circular objects in the night sky, southwest from my location in about the center of the city.   I first noticed 1 or 2 red lights moving perfectly horizontal above the tree line.  At first I assumed they were fireworks, but after viewing 2-3 more red lights, still moving perfecting horizontal through the night sky, I started paying closer attention.   On two occasions during the 10 minutes or so I saw the lights, I noticed 3 or 4 lights moving in a triangular pattern, still moving perfectly horizontal.   The number of total lights I witnessed was about 15-20.  All moving perfecting horizontal, never vertical, and horizontal from a long enough period of time and with no sound where it would dismiss it being fireworks.
