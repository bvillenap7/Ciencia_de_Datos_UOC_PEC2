UFO Medina County 1994;1994-09-20 23:45:00;5 minute;UFO Medina County 1994 I cannot remember the exact date, but I was returning home from work and saw a large circular shaped object with many lights hovering about 50-100 ft over the intersection of RT 18 and RT 94. There were a few cars at the intersection. I was in awe.  I went south on RT 94 and it paced my car.  I looked back and it disappeared. Did anyone else see this, or remember it?
