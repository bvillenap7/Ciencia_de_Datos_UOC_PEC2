I was sleeping when I was in my early teens. I was woken up by a light. With beings standing around me three or four of them. I was really scared. The room seemed to be larger than it was when the people and the light were not present. They all looked at me. I closed my eyes and was ready to be attacked. At first I thought someone had broken in and was going to hurt me. I opened my eyes again and saw them again moving around. At the time I did not think it really happened. I knew it was real but I thought that would make me crazy to admit that it was possible. I started to hear that other people have had similar experiences. I have also heard theories of aliens being able to travel in dimensional spaces unnown by our modern science. Giving them the ability to come and go at the blink of an eye. I had one other experience that was around the same time but I can't remember its been so long. My cousin and I were outside of the house where I saw the beings by my bed. We were there and saw lights in the sky just over the woods. It looked like lights you see on the side of a semi truck at first but there is no road close to that area of the woods and the lights were in the air close to the tree tops which means the lights were levitating. We both saw it. Him first then me. We both ran inside to get away because it was so strange and weird. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
