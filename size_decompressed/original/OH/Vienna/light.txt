Blue/Green light seen by 2 people. Myself and my husband which he is a AF Reservist.;2011-12-03 19:30:00;5 seconds;Blue/Green light seen by 2 people. Myself and my husband which he is a AF Reservist. December 3, 2011   Tonight my husband and I were traveling south on route 11 about 10 miles north of Vienna Ohio when  I happened to look out the front windshield and I saw a blue green light in the sky zoom by,  I immediately said to my husband if he had saw it and asked if he thought it was a falling star and he had said that he saw it but then I said to him, are falling stars a blue green color? And he said he didn’t think so but he didn’t know. So we were talking about it and I said to him that I thought it was a U.F.O. which I wasn’t using the term as a flying saucer but as something that was unidentifiable and flying/falling and it was a object, it was in our view for less then 5 seconds and disappeared. The area we were in and where it disappeared was a clear night and nothing to disappear behind such as buildings or trees. The time and date of the sighting was on December 3, 2011 between 7:15 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. not sure of the exact time because I didn’t think to look at the clock until after we got to our destination in Vienna Ohio.;41.2199;-80.6522
Silent bright light maneuvering east, south, north, west, and back east without banking.;2016-11-10 17:30:00;15 minutes;silent bright light maneuvering east, south, north, west, and back east without banking. Going to store.  Looked up at the sky and a bright light like a super bright light came out of the west.  It stopped at approx 10 to 11 o'clock high from our point of view.  It moved to the left, right, and back west.  The light came back east and stopped.  At that point just looked like a bright star.  If anyone saw it at that point they would have thought nothing of it.  It was just a white light.  No flashing lights or craft body seen.  It was silent.   We live 5 minutes from an airbase and have military craft practicing around us all the time.;41.2199;-80.6522
Wife and I saw three lights, one moving S then immediately N before disappearing. Two more then appeared. ((anonymous report));2017-04-26 04:07:00;10 minutes;Wife and I saw three lights, one moving south then immediately north before disappearing. Two more that appeared and began flashing. My wife and I were coming back from a late night trip to the store.  I noticed the sky was clear as we exited the car in our driveway.  We decided to stop and stare at the stars, when she spotted a light flying high in the sky.  It was the size of a star, but flashing and moving faster than any plane we've ever seen in the area.  She lost it behind a very small strip of cloud, but not before I managed to spot it.   However, when it came back into view, it was flying the complete opposite direction of what it had been.  The cloud was far too small for it to have turned around without us seeing it.  The light flickered a lot as it moved back across the sky.   I watched it for five minutes, before it suddenly disappeared in the middle of clear sky, as if it just vanished.   It was at this time my wife noticed two more lights appear in the sky.  They were the exact same size, same color, and same brightness.  They were parallel to each other and just a little distance away from eac! h other.  She saw one begin to glow, then the other, alternating.  Both lights were stationary at this time.  At this time I noticed the other light reappear in the exact same place it had been when I'd lost it.   At this point, i got too uncomfortable, and we went inside.
