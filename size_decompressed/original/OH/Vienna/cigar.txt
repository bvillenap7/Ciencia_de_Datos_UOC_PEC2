Vienna, Ohio;2002-12-08 21:00:00;5 minutes;Vienna, Ohio I was driving through Vienna, Ohio when I spotted two somewhat cigar shaped objects hovering in the East.  A beam of light appeared to come from one of the objects.  They hovered for about six minutes.  The beam only lasted about one minute. Shortly thereafter what appeared to be possibly three aircraft approaching them.  The objects almost instantly disappeared.
