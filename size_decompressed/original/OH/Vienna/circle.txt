Because there is an airport & military base within 5 miles of this sighting,  I can assure you that it was not an airplane or helicopter.  It was moving slowly away from HWY 82 (away from I-80 in direction and crossed over HWY 82) and then curved over the small horse race track in Vienna and headed toward over Brookfield.  I think it was a military drone because it was completely silent and very slow however I don't know.  I just know living near the airport for 30 years that this was not a manned civilian or military aircraft, because they all have a engine sound and are not this specific color orange.  This was not a Chinese lantern either.  It flew smoothly as if it were a slow silent drone or unknown aircraft.  It appeared to be about 500-1000' off the ground, but it was hard to tell.;41.2199;-80.6522
