I was driving south on route 11 near Columbiana Ohio and looked up at the sky and was enjoying the richness of the blue sky when an object appeared to roll into view from the other side of the blue! It was grey metalic and straight across the top and a little tapered on the sides.Only the tip of the craft came through the blue and it pulled back to the side and the blue closed over it and it was gone!I stopped used my 10by 50's and saw nothing in the area not even our planes nothing!! ((NUFORC Note:  Both of the reports from Columbiana, OH, are from the same source, although they indicate different times.  We will attempt to resolve the apparent discrepancy.
