The it turned in a south easterly direction... as we both watched this object for a few minutes.  It finally traveled out of sight... I grew up in try he Cleveland area and I have been use to seeing planes at night.  But I do not believe in UFOs, but at the same time I have No clue as to what this object was.  I was just wondering if you had any others come forward with a similar report in this area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
