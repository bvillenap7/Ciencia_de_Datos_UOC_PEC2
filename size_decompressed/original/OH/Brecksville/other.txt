BLIMP TO RECTANGLE TO SQUARE OVER I-77 IN BRECKSVILLE, OHIO;2004-10-25 12:00:00;10 minutes;BLIMP TO RECTANGLE TO SQUARE OVER I-77 IN BRECKSVILLE, OHIO I WAS DRIVING ON I-77 SOUTHBOUND, @ 11:45AM, ON MONDAY, OCTOBER 25, 2004, FROM DOWNTOWN CLEVELAND, OHIO TO BRECKSVILLE, OHIO.  AT THE PLEASANT VALLEY EXIT (MAYBE 8 MILES SOUTH OF DOWNTOWN)  I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT TO BE A BLIMP.  I WONDERED WHAT KIND OF NATIONAL EVENT HAD BEEN IN TOWN, AND THOUGHT OF NONE.  THEN THE BLIMP CHANGED SHAPE TO A RECTANGLE (THE CRAFT WAS MAYBE 5 MILES OFF, DIRECTLY OVER I-77 PERHAPS @ MILLER ROAD EXIT)  I WONDERED @ THIS POINT IF OTHER CARS WOULD START PULLING OVER, BUT THEY DID NOT.  I WATCHED THE CRAFT THEN TAKE A SQUARE FORM, IN A TOTALLY BLACK COLOR.  I HAD TO GET OFF @ ROUTE 82, AND LOST SIGHT OF IT  BUT IT REMAINS EITHER SOMETHING THAT APPEARED TO ME ONLY, OR, PERHAPS OTHERS NOTICED IT TOO.  THE SIZE CHANGE WAS FORM A NORMAL BLIMP SIZE TO THREE TIMES AS LARGE WITH THE NEW SHAPE. COLOR CHANGE FROM GRAY TO BLACK.;41.3154;-81.6215000000001
