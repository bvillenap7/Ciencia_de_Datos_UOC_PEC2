Triangle craft in clearing at Cuyahoga Valley National Forest;2008-10-31 20:01:00;1-2 minutes;Triangle craft in clearing at Cuyahoga Valley National Forest Me and 2 of my friends were out driving in the Cuyahoga Valley National Forest, looking for Helltown, a popular place for teens to hang out at on halloween.  We passed through it because we saw a sheriff and headed north on Riverview Road.   We then turned west on Snowville Road, but turned around to go back to Helltown.    Upon turning southbound on Riverview Road, we looked behind us to check for traffic.  In the sky, hovering was a black triange, about a couple thousand feet off the ground.  It had 4 lights that were a bluish hue, 3 in the corners and one in the middle.   We tried to take pictures with our cell phones, but nothing came out.   We turned off the radio and the car for a moment to check for sound, and there was nothing.   After a minute or so, we got scared and decided to leave.;41.3154;-81.6215000000001

Could see inside the lowered &quotglass&quot room Saw a big white triangle floating above me head in Brecksville.  It had green lights on one side and red lights on the other side.  It wasn't flying.  It made no noise.  It was simply floating above me head at about 12am.  It was HUGE.. like two football fields and it was just above the trees .. maybe fifty feet higher than the trees (Cuyahoga County, Ohio, 13 miles south of Cleveland, Ohio) 4-13-16 eleven oâ€™clock at night.;41.3154;-81.6215000000001
