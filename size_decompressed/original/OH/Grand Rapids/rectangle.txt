Small white and blue rectangular object scares dog and boy.;2007-11-03 14:30:00;10 seconds;Small white and blue rectangular object scares dog and boy. My 11 year old son came running into the house with a frightened dog telling me he had just seen something strange in the yard.  He said he was walking the dog and she suddenly saw something and got scared.  He looked up and saw a rectangular object with rounded sides in the air (I found out later he meant the sides were convex).  It was white with a wide blue stripe and was partially hidden by trees in our yard, but was in front of trees further away in our yard.  He described it as waving back and forth, then moving off to the right of his view further behind the trees where he could not see it anymore.  He said it seemed to be about 4 to 6 inches wide and about 18 inches long.  It was at an angle, not perfectly vertical.  He said it made no sound.  It did not give off light.  He insisted it was not a balloon, nor a piece of windblown trash or a kite.  There was a very light breeze, but that area of the yard is shielded from wind by trees.  I inspected the area a few minutes later.  There was no sign of any debris or trash (which would have likely been snagged in some pines trees, based upon the direction of the breeze).  He is a very grounded person and does not make up stories.  I have no idea what he saw, and I am at a loss to explain it.  We live in a rural area on a fairly busy highway, but trees isolate our house from the road.  Our dog is timid, but the fact she was the first to see something and reacted before my son saw it, makes me think he absolutely saw something real.;41.4391;-83.8501
