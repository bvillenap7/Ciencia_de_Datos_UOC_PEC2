I went out of the garrage with my son who was then only 13 years old. I noticed an oval shape object in the sky, with lights all around, just hovering over us, not moving, just stationary. I told my son to run and get the camera in my room. After about 2-3 minutes of being stationary, it moved very fast swerving from side to side. No noice all the time, then disappeared as it flew very far until I could not see it anymore. Much faster than an airplane. When the camera arrived, the object was no longer there. The following day, there was a small article in the Akron-Beacon Journal of some report of other people who witnessed the same. I never reported to anybody then.
