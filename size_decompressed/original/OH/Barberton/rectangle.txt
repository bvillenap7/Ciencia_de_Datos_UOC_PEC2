Huge rectangular craft.  ((anonymous report));2002-08-10 02:40:00;2 minutes;Huge rectangular craft My husband and I were in an alley near second street and Tuscarawas ave around 2:40am.  Something told me to look up and when I did I seen a huge rectangular shaped object over top of the buildings.  It was not only silent, but seemed to suck all the noise out of the air.  There were lights all the way around it.  It was color shifting with the surrounding buildings and street lights.  It couldn't be more than 50 foot above the buildings because it blocked the sky it was so big.  I told my husband, look, look look, but he didn't move.  I watched it smoothly continue towards van street until I couldn't see it anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
