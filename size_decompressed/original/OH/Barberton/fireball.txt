Fire in the sky on a crisp starry fall night.;2012-11-07 19:45:00;2-3 minutes;Fire in the sky on a crisp starry fall night. At approximately 7:45 eastern standard time my husband and I were  getting ready to sit in our hot tub. He was already in, I was grabbing towels and he's yelling my name saying “hurry, where are you, you gotta see this hurry”. So I'm standing in the patio doorway and I see this “fireball” in the sky.  There is no sound and it is moving slowly at the horizon from NE to SW.  I was in awe!  At one point it was stationary, then it would move SW, then it looked as if it were ascending straight up because the ball of fire got smaller and smaller until it was gone.  The event lasted approximately 3 minutes.;41.0187999999999;-81.6173999999998
