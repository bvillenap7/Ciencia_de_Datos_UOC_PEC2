Star like UFO hovers and then zooms across the sky.;1991-07-01 22:00:00;10 minutes;Star like UFO hovers and then zooms across the sky. It was a very dark and clear night. We were at the outdoor movie theater so the sky was very visible.  My friends first noticed a very bright object in the sky and then pointed it out to me.  To me it looked very similar to a star, however it at least 5x larger and brighter than the largest star in the sky. The object made no noise and just hovered in the same spot for at least 10 minutes, it was almost directly above us in the middle of the sky.   It then shot clear across the horizon, to my left it was clearly visible until distant trees finally blocked the view.  It only took about 2 or 3 seconds to zoom completely out of my view, covering 50% of the sky.;41.0187999999999;-81.6173999999998

Strange glowing star with reddish glow moving in slow, circular patterns.;2014-03-25 02:00:00;Unknown;Strange glowing star with reddish glow moving in slow, circular patterns. Every night I take my dog outside around this time before heading to bed, and I always look up at the stars if I can see any. Tonight I saw a larger star that seemed to have a reddish outer glow, which I hadn't seen before.  Thinking it was unusual, yet pretty, I did still and watched it for awhile.  It began moving in almost circular patterns, though it wasn't very fast.  I've seen plenty of planes flying around at night before, and I can tell the difference began this, and those. Planes tend to move faster than it was. I didn't know what to think of it, and its pretty cold outside so I went back in with my dog.  It was still moving when I left.  I didn't know what else to do, so I searched it up on Google and decided I might as well leave a sighting here. I should also state the area I love in its very quite, to the point where I can hear my own foot steps echoing.  The neighborhood mainly consists of elderly people.;41.0187999999999;-81.6173999999998

The one moved horizontally across the other crafts.   I later looked on google maps and found that the ufos were either hovering over a junk yard, or behind the junkyard which contains a field and a small pond;41.0187999999999;-81.6173999999998
