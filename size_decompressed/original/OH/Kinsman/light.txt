On 09/25/13 at approximately 8:02 pm I was standing in the Kinsman IGA parking lot speaking with a friend.  I was standing, facing the Northeasterly direction when I glanced upward toward the sky.  I saw a bright light that quickly shot a brief distance across the sky.  The object went behind a cloud and did not reappear on the other side of the cloud cover.  The object seemed to be round or spherical in shape but I wasn't able to distinguish an exact outline.  The speed with which the object moved was extremely quick and would not have been mistaken for an airplane.  The object appeared to be slightly lower than an airplane would have been flying.  I donâ€™t believe that the object was a star because it was much larger and brighter than the stars and it was much lower.;41.4354;-80.5765
