Orange orbs over Loveland, OH;2012-11-28 22:51:00;3 minutes;Orange orbs over Loveland, OH As I was taking the dogs outside, I saw 2 orange orbs flying over the neighbor's house. It was snowing and the cloud cover was low.  They were not in the clouds but under the clouds. I got very nervous because a group of us was outside at the same time last year and saw 9 similar objects flying across the sky.  The objects moved very slowly and seemed to dim then get brighter, then dim again.  As they passed the neighbor's house, 1 of the lights disappeared. the other kept moving very slowly.  There was no sound coming from the orbs.  An airplane crossed over about 5 minutes after the occurrence which gave off a sound.  As I was watching, i grabbed my iphone and took a few pictures.  There was some weird effects on a couple of pictures that I can only attribute to the snow falling.  At least 3 of the pictures clearly show the objects.  The objects were heading 313 degrees NW according to my iphone compass.;39.2453999999998;-84.2537000000007
