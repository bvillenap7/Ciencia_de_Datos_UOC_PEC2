Inexplicable fires in sky over Clermont County, Ohio;2007-09-13 20:55:00;3 minutes;Inexplicable fires in sky over Clermont County, Ohio We were driving home from football practice and saw 3 or 4 glowing red objects in the sky.  They faded on and off in no particular order, moving slightly, then all appeared at once (4 or 5 total).  They then disappeared.  They looked like orange/red flame or lights.  No apparent noise like you'd expect from a military fighter, although looked like could be tail flames.  Could not have been, they were too close to each other and hovering, and they disappeared too quickly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

4 clustered, orange, moving objects around 9 at night.;2015-08-14 21:00:00;unsure as just driving by;4 clustered, orange, moving objects around 9 at night. Driving home from work when noticed what looked like a stagnant fireball in the sky.  It was round and an orange color that seemed after a minute to be very slowly rising.   Continued down w. Loveland Ave. and noticed another, then another, and then 2 more identical objects.   They all made a diagonal, relatively straight line with the first object being the highest at first.   I looked back a few minutes later and the last 2 I saw were higher and closer to the other 2 than at first.;39.2453999999998;-84.2537000000007
