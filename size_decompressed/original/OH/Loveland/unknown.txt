Silent, low, slow moving, SE to N. Suddenly awake, I saw in the near distance a stationary,triangular span of light. As I approached the window, the light remained in a fixed position as it flipped upward into a semi-circle triangle, composed of three distinct semi-circles. Slowly it began to move from southeast to north across the sky. The lights lingered within a thin, low, transparent cloud, illuminating the cloud, I got a good look but I could not detect any cohesive form holding the lights togeather. There was no other hint of shape or sound.  My window was open.  As the cloud drifted revealing the black sky, the lights moved quickly north.
