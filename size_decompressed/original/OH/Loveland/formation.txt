Whitish orange lights in two triangle formations pass overhead.;2011-11-25 18:04:00;2 Minutes;Whitish orange lights in two triangle formations pass overhead. Me and some friends were out on a street corner in Loveland Ohio on a park bench next to Tano Bistro (I used a website with google maps to figure out our exact location, which was Latitude:N 39° 16' 4.893 Longitude:W 84° 15' 30.5551), when we saw these 3 whitish-orange lights in a triangle formation starting to rise up from the horizon (South/Southeast) going really fast.  I got my phone out and started taking video of the lights, when another formation of lights rose up, this time there were five lights, the same color, in a much larger, somewhat uneven triangle pattern (Same direction).  At this point people walking down the street, and eating outside at Tano stopped what they were doing to watch it, many getting out their phones as well and recording it.  There was at least one child next to me that was really scared.  Both sets of lights continued to rise up form the horizon, appearing to rise almost vertically, before vanishing as we watched, while passing overhead.  I'm still not sure whether they were 2 separate craft with multiple lights on each, or 8 craft with one light each.  I live in the area, and come to this spot all the time, and I've never seen anything like this in my life. Note: I did see aircraft in the vicinity before and after the event, however they appeared to be civilian, and I am not aware of any that were in the vicinity during the event.  I would also prefer to be contacted by email if need be, only use the phone number if you have to.;39.2453999999998;-84.2537000000007
