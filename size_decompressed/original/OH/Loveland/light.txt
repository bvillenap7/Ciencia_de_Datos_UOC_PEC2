Stationary light that changed from yellow to green to red and was hovering below the clouds.;2001-03-25 23:00:00;unknown;Stationary light that changed from yellow to green to red and was hovering below the clouds. I saw one craft to the Southwest that was hovering and moving back and forth.  Another was to the Northwest and was stationary.  The approximate altitude was 5000-10,000 feet.  Both had lights that changed from yellow to green to red very rapidly and both were below the clouds.;39.2453999999998;-84.2537000000007
Bright white lights. Unusually low on horizon. Maneuvered like a jet/airplane cannot, hovered in air very close to my location.;2009-10-05 10:30:00;8-10 minutes;Bright white lights. Unusually low on horizon. Maneuvered like a jet/airplane cannot, hovered in air very close to my location. It was around 10:30pm and I was taking my dogs for a walk down the street. As I turned the corner to take my dogs to their favorite spot I noticed that in the clearing in the trees to the south at the end of the street, there were 2 very bright, crystal white stars sitting unusually low on the horizon line. One sitting significantly lower than the other, and slighty to the right.  As I continued to look I noticed that they had a reddish tinge to them at times so I thought they could be planets, but still very strange. I looked away for a moment to let my dogs go to the bathroom then looked back up at the objects. When I looked back up it appeared as if the lower of the two objects might have possibly been moving upward a bit, but the movement was so miniscule I thought my eyes were just playing tricks on me. That’s when the object sped up and began weaving from left to right in an upwardly fashion. This was when I first realized I was seeing something very ou! t of the ordinary.  The object continued to weave upward until in was parallel with the higher object. At that point seemingly stopped moving completely, but started getting brighter.  I realized then that it hadn’t stopped moving but was instead moving straight toward me. It was headed due north. I was frozen in place so I stood and watched as the object got so close that it seemed to be just right down the street I was standing on, maybe a couple miles in the sky, if that.  I stood there, dumbfounded for a solid 30 seconds, then a car came down the road. I stood in front of the car and tried to get him to stop so he could witness this too, but after a few honks of his horn I realized he wasn’t going to be cooperating with me. So he passed by and I continued standing there staring at this mysterious light hovering so conspicuously in the sky wondering if anyone else was seeing it. After a stare-down with the object for about another minute I began walking away keeping my head! cocked over my shoulder, making sure not to take my eyes off ! of the l ight. The very second that I started walking, the object followed. I walked about 50 feet then turned my body around. The light stopped moving as well and at that point I yelled, very loudly, 	“What do you want?” 	No response of course. 	So began another stand-off. After what seemed like about a minute I began walking away again, and once again the mysterious floating light followed. But this time after about 25 feet it began to ascend and head north east, gaining incredible speed in a very short time. It took about 10 seconds for it to completely disappear from sight, but as it passed by the moon I saw that it left a strange looking trail. The trail looked misty and translucent, but also unusually linear (unlike a jet, whose exhaust billows out of the back of the craft, and spreads out almost immediately). It also made a very low, faint humming noise that I had not noticed until it passed overhead. After the object disappeared  I looked back to the south to see if the other light was still there. It wasn’t. So I quickly scanned the sky looking to see if it had moved. When I turned to the north, in the exact opposite direction I had originally seen the objects, I spotted another light, but this one quickly ! shot up, then back down and out of sight behind a dense patch of trees. I then ran home and told my whole family. Theres no doubt in my mind that what I saw was not of this world. Whatever this technology was is far too advanced for anything I’ve ever heard of or seen besides the only obvious explanation. Aliens?

Moving light stops, gets brighter, then moves faster.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible flare of reflected light from Iridium satellite??  PD));2011-06-15 22:00:00;6 minutes;Moving light stops and gets brighter, then moves faster. At first it looked like a satellite, a star-sized light moving across the sky.  But then it stopped and got brighter and brighter and then dimmed to the same brightness as it was before and started moving in a slightly altered path, but faster, disappearing under the treeline in our woods.

Line of red/orange lights travel northeast, making no sound.;2012-01-01 00:15:00;15 minutes;Line of red/orange lights travel northeast, making no sound. I was watching the fireworks from an upstairs window when a see a red dot through the trees in my woods.  It comes out of the treeline into the clearing around my house then into the tree line on the other side.  Then another does the same thing. So we go outside to get a better view, and there are two more, an orangish reddish dot, following the same path, an estimated 300 meters up, moving at a variance of speeds, ranging from an estimated 100 to 250 miles an hour.  They were all moving south to northeast.  They were evenly spaced. In total, there were 8 or 9.  They did not make a sound. I thought they may have been lanterns, but there was no wind, and if there was, they couldn't have flown in that straight line.;39.2453999999998;-84.2537000000007
Floating crafts dancing with each other than leaving scene quickly.;2012-06-18 01:04:00;3 minutes;floating crafts dancing with each other than leaving scene quickly. was laying in bed and looked out window, saw two crafts floating parrell to each other not moving.   1 min later the crafts almost seemed to dance with each other a little bit  then about 2 min one craft moved away at a very quick rate of speed,  about 15 seconds later the other craft started to move at a slower rate but on the same direction line as the other craft.;39.2453999999998;-84.2537000000007
Strange orange glowing lights in the sky late at night.  ((NUFORC Note:  Japanese HTV-4 craft flying close to the ISS?  PD));2013-08-11 22:00:00;1.5 minutes;Strange orange glowing lights in the sky late at night. I saw 2 objects in the sky that looked like they were about 1/2 mile apart.with a pulsating orange glow caused by a brighter white light inside them.  They moved across the sky in a straight line coming from the West and heading East.   At first I thought that they might be hot air balloons but they were moving way to fast for a balloon.  I also saw a fixed wing plane go directly beneath them and they were much larger than the plane.  The objects seemed to temporarily dissapear when fixed wing plane came close to both of them and then both reappeared when the airplane got past their position.   All of sudden they both just vanished.   This is not the first time I have seen this type of object in the sky.  I get up early for work (4:30am) and have to take my dog out to relieve himself, so a lot of times the skies are clear and I have seen these same glowing objects before over the past year.   There is no sound coming from them and there are no house lights on or cars traveling in the area at that time of day to create any kind of refracting light scenario.
