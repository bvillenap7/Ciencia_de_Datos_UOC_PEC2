Three white lights in the shape of a triangle were moving at a normal speed high in the N. East sky.  The object made no sound what so ever.  It started to slow a little.  I looked down for only a second and looked back up and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other, similar reports for this date and time.  PD));39.2453999999998;-84.2537000000007
Triangular object flew overhead at about 20 to 30 mph just above the trees!;2009-01-17 06:25:00;5 minutes;Triangular object flew overhead at about 20 to 30 mph just above the trees! On Saturday morning, January 17, 2009 I was leaving my house to go to work at 6:25 am.  I backed the SUV out of the garage and once I was in the street, facing Northwest, I immediately noticed a large bright yellowish white ball of light in the sky low on the horizon.  I had absolutely no clue what it could have been, but I wondered if it was a plane on fire or maybe a large plane with its headlights pointed toward me since my subdivision is on a flight path to and from Cincinnati Northern Kentucky airport.  I pulled up to the stop sign at the end of my street watching it and soon realized it was getting closer and flying toward the southeast at the back of my subdivision.  I turned left and stopped at the next stop sign and looked to my right and realized it was still flying low and moving very slowly.  I turned left and headed to the end of the street to exit my subdivision so I was driving Southeast too and could still see the light out my driver side window.  It was now to my left.  I hurried up and turned left onto State Route 48 to see if I could intercept it, and now I could see that the object was no longer a single large bright light but actually a solid object with multiple lights on it, and that it was flying very slowly, maybe only about 20 or 30 mph!  It was coming toward me now so I stopped the truck and put my window down to get a better view of it.  I couldn’t believe how close it was to the trees that are about 30 feet tall.  It was probably only 25 or 50 feet above the trees.  I watched as it approached me and it had several bright white lights across the front of it.  I opened the door and stepped out of my vehicle but stood right there, and I could hear this sound coming from it that I’m finding hard to describe.  Sort of like the sound of a jet engine with the volume turned way down, and this thing flew over me so slowly that I could now see that it was shaped like a triangle but with rounded edges, and was about the twice the size of my SUV.  There were no wings and! it had several white lights on the bottom and on the corners of it.  I saw a car coming up the street behind me so I hopped back in and put it in drive and tried to keep it in my view but was unable to.  I didn’t think to use my cell phone to take pictures of it!  I searched the Internet hoping to find something similar and I am uploading the two photos I found that are VERY similar to what I saw.  The first picture is the bright light off in the distance, and the second picture is one of a triangle but the one I saw had more lights under it.;39.2453999999998;-84.2537000000007
