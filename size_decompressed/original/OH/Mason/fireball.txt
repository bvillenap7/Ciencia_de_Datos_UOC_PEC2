Three followed by one glowing silent red balls in a line.;2013-03-23 09:11:00;5 minutes;Three followed by one glowing silent red balls in a line My son, two of his friends and I saw a line of red glowing lights traveling from the northeast towards the southwest roughly towards Cincinnnati.  There was a line of three red glowing 'balls' maybe the size of a bee bee at arms length, in a straight line.  There was no jet engine sound, and the boys and I both agreed that they looked line they were glowing kind of like fire.  They were evenly spaced, maybe a half mile apart.  There was a fourth trailing ball that followed further back, and was heading in the same direction.  All four slowly blinked out, after tailing off towards the south.;39.3359999999996;-84.3125999999992
