Silver ball chased by jet aircraft;2004-09-22 18:00:00;<1 minute;Silver ball chased by jet aircraft About a week and a half ago (today is 10/5), my 19-year-old daughter mentioned that she had seen something unusual in the sky that day. I was otherwise pre-occupied and didn't really sit down and talk with her about it until last night.  She told me she was driving to the gym that day. It was late afternoon, perfectly clear sky and plenty of daylight. She was moving slowly in traffic when she caught something out of the corner of her eye. She looked up and saw what she believed was either a large private jet or a small commercial jet. The unusual thing is that, flying about two plane lengths ahead of the aircraft, she clearly saw what appeared to be a small silver ball. The plane and the object flew along a straight flight path. Judging from my daughter's descriptions, it appeared both were at around 10000 feet, flying perhaps a couple hundred miles an hour. Nothing erratic, just a smooth trajectory across the sky.  She had them in clear view for less than a minute. However, during that time she saw the sun glinting off both the jet and the object. They maintained their relative distance from each other but my daughter was convinced that these were two discrete objects and not connected to one another in any way. Again, judging from a drawing she made, I estimate the object was no more than 10 feet in diameter.  My daughter is a pretty level-headed young woman.  She said this was like nothing she had ever seen before.  I am reporting this because the sighting took place in a heavily populated area and I would think there might be other independent witnesses.
