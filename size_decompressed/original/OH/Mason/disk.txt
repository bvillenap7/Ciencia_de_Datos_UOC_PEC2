Silent, round object over Mason, OH;2009-07-03 20:00:00;5 minutes;Silent, round object over Mason, OH I saw the object coming from the west quite a way off in the distance.  What caught my attention was the red light seemingly on the bottom of the object.  it wasn't clear like an airplane or other craft.  The read light was fuzzy to the best of my description.  As it got closer it appeared to be flying right under the clouds and the red light appeared to move location on the object.  Also, the red light was getting dimmer then went out completely as the object was overhead.  I heard no sound and the object was round and black or dark.  It seemed to be traveling at a good rate of speed, possibly a little faster than a small plane.  Like I said, it appeared to be several hundred feet in the air right below the clouds.  My wife saw it also but dismissed it as a plane.  She said that she saw the red light as it moved away towards the east.  It continued in a straight line west to east until it flew out of sight.;39.3359999999996;-84.3125999999992
