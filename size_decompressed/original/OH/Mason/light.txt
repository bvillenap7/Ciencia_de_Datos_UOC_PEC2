Slowly moving orange lights in the sky.;2013-08-24 23:50:00;10 minutes;Slowly moving orange lights in the sky. I was sitting on my patio looking at stars over the tree line directly to the north. To my right (east), the moon was at about 45 degrees above the horizon.  I glanced towards the moon and saw a line of 3 or 4 orange lights slowly moving south to north a few degrees above the moon.   At a specific point, they would fade away.   This happened three or four times over about a ten minute period.  The first several lights were above the moon. The last two or three lights were below the moon.  I-71 is just a couple miles to the east of my house.   My sister used to be a flight attendant for a regional airline and told me once that when flying into CVG from the northeast or out of CVG and going to the northeast, they would follow I-71.   My first thought was that the lights were planes flying out of CVG.  However, the number and spacing of the lights seems to make that implausible. I then thought they might be Chinese lanterns, but they seemed much too high for that.;39.3359999999996;-84.3125999999992
