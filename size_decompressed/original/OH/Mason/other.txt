So my husband and i went outside to watch it. THen some of the neighbors started coming out as it got closer. It was made of some sort of silver metal with white and green lights around the side. It was an odd shape, that i've never seen before. Sort of like the stereotypical space craft, disk shaped. But it had sort of a hexagonal center. It slowly landed down in the woods near our house. We drove through the woods but could not ind anything. ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the other witnesses to this alleged incident to submit reports, as well.
