I have seen the exact thing before almost a year ago but in a different location in my town.  We drove to find a strobe light and there was no evidence of one.  With this sighting being our second this year I looked it up online and found others reported same phenomenon in Virginia last month.  Any idea of what this is would be appreciated as it is very alarming. It was dark out and you could still see the clouds through the lights.;40.7395513615028;-84.1410552112666
