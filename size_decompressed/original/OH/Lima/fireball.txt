In the lead were two, then two more side by side, then the last three strung out behind the four.;2013-05-07 23:00:00;5 minutes;In the lead were two, then two more side by side, then the last three strung out behind the four... My husband was looking out the front window and he called me to come and look.  and there was seven glowing orange orbs coming east, my husband got the binoculars and went outside and when they got to our house they turned north.   They were less then 2000 feet and traveling real slow...my husband has a pilot license and this was his estimate.

My 9 yr old said, What are those bright lights? My husband and I and two of our children were waiting in line at drive thru restaurant.  My 9 yr old said what are those brights lights?  We looked to the east, and on the distance were 8 fireballs which at first glance appeared could be Chinese lanterns....  However immediately my husband and I said moving way too fast for that they were in a formation moving like Chinese lanterns but much faster.....my husband got his smart phone out and we kept watching and soon they went off course and shifted directions.....I never took my eyes off them and somehow they merged into 3 red balls....and faded away within about 15 seconds....it was very weird!   My husband's phone picked nothing up.....and there was no sound.  My husband said only possibility other than ufo was jet fighters training in formation?  But even he doubted that...we looked online and there was no mention of night training that night.....also I researched to see if anyone else had seen because I can't imagine nobody else seeing this?  Maybe if I post my Story others will Speak up.;40.7395513615028;-84.1410552112666
