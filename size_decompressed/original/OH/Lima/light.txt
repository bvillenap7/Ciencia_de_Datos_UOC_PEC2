CUFOS REPORT>   One round bright yellowish light (halogen?) light was seen by one woman from house window looking to North while similar light was seen from moving automobile driving east looking  North across a reservoir shortly before 9 p.m e.s.t. The first one saw it hover for about 10 minutes. County fairgrounds and housing development and two large reservoirs beneath sighting location of light. Witnesses seem convinced it could not  have been a helicopter or a conventional  aircraft hovering.;40.7395513615028;-84.1410552112666

I have seen these lights on several occasions along with friends and co-workers. Looking to the northeast, I saw two orange lights that just disappeared.  I have seen the lights on several occasions along with friends and co-workers.  I have seen these lights, which can become very brilliant at times, at several different times of the night.  The thing about them is not only their color but that they NEVER chance location in the sky, just in intensity.;40.7395513615028;-84.1410552112666
Orange light that moves slow.;2014-07-25 22:00:00;25 minutes;Orange light that moves slow. First witness was in a back room of their home and states that they did notice the orange light but thought nothing of it due to frequent helicopter travel above the home.   First witness then noticed the light had not moved, cats outside froze as they looked up at the light and then ran off when it moved.   The light then proceeded to slowly and steadily move upwards and towards the house.   The frst witness began to record the light and then realized the orange light was going descending toward the house.   Frst witness ran outside to attempt to record but became frightened when they realized the orange light made no sound.   They then procced to rally two other witnesses and follow the light above the front of the house when it descended up into the sky and disappeared.   Witnesses say it seemed like an object but the orange lights over came the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Saw a very bright white light.;2015-08-18 21:30:00;2 minutes;Saw a very bright white light. Spotted what I thought was a very bright star at first but turned out to be moving directly overhead.  No sound and it was just a very bright white light.  May have also had some red in it as well.  Went directly overhead to Northeast and out of view within a 2 minute span.  Saw a plane just after and it looked as if the light was actually higher than the plane.  And it was still the brightest in the sky.
