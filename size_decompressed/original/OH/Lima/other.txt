I was returning home from church.  I had turned off of Eastown Rd. onto Allentown Rd. heading East.  I noticed what appeared to be two horizontal rows of six lights each hovering in the air about 75 feet up.   As I got closer I realized that it was hovering above the area behind the Tom Ahl Chevrolet dealership on Allentown Rd.  The upper lights on each end would flash intermittently.  I turned into the Walmart parking lot across the road to get a better look.   When I exited my vehicle the object was gone.  Other than a cart pickup who was headed in with a string of carts I was the only person in the parking lot.;40.7395513615028;-84.1410552112666
Vertical, pencil-shaped, object seen.;2015-08-15 23:45:00;5 minutes;Vertical, pencil-shaped, object seen. We were Eastbound on State Route 30 just West of the I-75 interchange.  There was a vertical pencil shaped light a head of us just off the right side of the highway.  It was white and red and had what looked like it like filaments of the same color trailing off from the sides of it.   I looked away for a moment and when I looked back it was gone.  My wife, who was driving said she didn't see it.;40.7395513615028;-84.1410552112666
