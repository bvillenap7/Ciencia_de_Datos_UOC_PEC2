The three of us were sitting in my room (doing the obvious for 11:30 at night)when the lights in my room started flashing. It must be the power said one of us. The lights contiued to flash until the power went out in the whole house. It was time for person 1 to leave so we all went outside to send him on his way. He had a brand new car and for some odd reason, the car's power would not turn on. The three of us sat out on the driveway looking at the stars when person 2 thought that he saw an oddly shaped craft, in the shape of a teardrop, in the sky. It had slowly flashing lights and the lights changed color every five flashes. There were three of them. They moved at a very slow pace, as if they were looking at something. After about 4 to 5 minutes, the 3 crafts took off at a very rapid pace. All power was restored to the neighborhood and my house and person 1 was able to start his car and go on his way home.
