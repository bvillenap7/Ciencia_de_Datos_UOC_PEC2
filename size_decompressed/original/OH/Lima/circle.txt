I thought I was seeing a moving low cloud reflecting the light.;2012-11-20 19:00:00;2 hours;On the way home from my parents house who live 10 minutes away I thought I was seeing a moving low cloud reflecting the light from my car as it was slightly foggy out.   As I turned onto State route 81 I realizes I was seeing a faded white light moving in a perfect circle pattern.  The light itself appeared to be moving in a wavy pattern as it was circling in a round pattern, as if the circle pattern was perhaps on a disc shaped object.   I watched this for two hours off and on, my husband and my neighbor saw it as well. Neither one of us could find an explanation it was not a airplane or helicopter, it was not a strobe light as there was no beam leading up to it.  It was literally by itself in the sky and I've never seen anything like it.;40.7395513615028;-84.1410552112666
