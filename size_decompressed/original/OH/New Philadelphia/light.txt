Light moving irratic in the sky.;2000-03-15 22:00:00;20 min.;Light moving irratic in the sky. I went out side to potty my dog. I glanced up and saw a light move accross the sky in the N. East sky. At first I thought it was a satalite. As i watched, I saw it move at the same speed all the time. It would move up and down very quickly still going in the same direction. A very fluid motion. As it moved forward, from my perspective, It would drop 12 inches and rise again 12 inches aprox. The object was extremely far up in the sky, like a satalite. So i guess 12 inches for me would equal what, 1000 feet or so for it??;40.4835999999997;-81.4386999999993
