My husband and I were in a snack bar inside a K-Mart between 5 & 6 pm oct 7th o1. We were sitting beside a large window, there was a clear blue sky and bright sunlight. I first noticed a longish shiny object come from over top the store and asked what am I seeing? We both then continued to watch the craft, it was flying low, about where small airplanes go at their highest. It had no wings, was reflecting sunlight, and seemed to have a verticle fin or rudder on the back. it flew very steady SE until it became a speck and then went out of site. It had no jetstream of any kind. We do not know if it made a noise, but we noticed that no one walking into the entrance of the store looked up or noticed it in any way. We have looked up every sort of american aircraft and even unmanned spy planes, and none of them looked like it. The closest thing to what it looked like is a missle, like the tomahawk missles. My husband is in research and development field, and i am a professional. we are wondering if the government was testing some new sort of craft, as it was the day of the first air strikes against Afghanistan.;40.4835999999997;-81.4386999999993
