Black retangular object with no sound or lights;2017-05-15 11:30:00;1/2 hour;black retangular object with no sound or lights When leaving a job site this morning at approximately 11:30 AM, I and another man observed a black rectangular object in the sky west of our location at Lake Loramie, Ohio. We observed this object for several minutes as it traveled on a northwesterly direction. While observing, we witnessed the object tumble lengthwise 180 degrees.  I took several pictures of this happening. I then got into my vehicle and proceeded to follow the object.  I drove north on St. Rte 362 along the west bank of Lake Loramie into Minster, Ohio.  I traveled west thru Minster on the Minster â€“ Egypt Pike to St. Rte. 364 still observing the object.  I turned north on St. Rte. 364 and proceeded to St. Rte. 119. Turning west on St. Rte. 119, I follow the object into Maria Stein, Ohio.  Upon reaching Saint Johns Road in Maria Stein, I turned north again observing that the object appeared to become either triangular or diamond shaped and I again photograph it.  I looked at the road for traffic and upon looking back up, it has disappeared.;40.3305;-84.3758
