My neighbor and I were outside in my driveway talking and my wife came out to see if I wanted to come in and watch the news on TV. My neighbor commented on what a clear night it was. As I looked up to comfirm his observation I saw an object that looked like a star moving from north to south high in the sky. I asked my wife to go in the house and get my binoculars while I kept the object in sight. I found the object with the binoculars and, of course, it looked bigger. Then, all of a sudden, it stopped, turned crimson red and zipped off in the same direction(south) changing color from crimson red to bright red to bright yellow to bright white then suddenly vanishing.
