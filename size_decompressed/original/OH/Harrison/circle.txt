Orange/red balls.;2015-01-12 18:30:00;3 minutes;orange/red balls While running an errand this evening at the local grocery store, I noticed 2 dark orange balls of light in the night sky.  Since we have an airport in our community, I suspected it was a helicopter or other air craft at first, that changed direction maybe suddenly (?) I suspected the two balls of light were the lights on either end of a plane, or either wing... or nose and tail?   That was not the case.  The two balls moved in a fashion that made me suspect the plane (or helicopter) must be spinning or about to crash... then, as the balls twisted around in mid air, the seem to be interacting with each other somehow.  (Truly having a panicky moment then, as I realized it was not a plane, and it was NOT a crashing plane.   The two balls then skittered off, far enough apart that I knew they were not one plane, and then sped up..  Seemingly propelled by something.   The entire thing from start to finish only too a few minutes...but the time I stopped panicking enough to think I should get out my cell for a video, they were gone.   I'm an educated rational, sane person.;39.2638999999999;-84.7816999999997
