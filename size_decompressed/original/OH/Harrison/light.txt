I;2000-06-19 21:52:00;7;I was driving east on I-74 towards Cincinati.  There is a lot air activity south of Harrison because of Greater Cincinnati Airport.   I was noticing some of the planes flying over.  It was dark out at that time.  One flew near the objecting (relative to me) and I noticed it wasn't moving as fast as the rest of the planes and didn't have the kind of running lights that the other aircraft did.   It seemed to be higher.   The light flickered like a fire or had an orange cast to it.   There might have been a pattern to the flicker but I didn't think to remember the sequence if there was one. I pulled of the highway at the second Harrison exit (exit 3) at Dryfork Rd and into the Chevron station.   I checked my watch and it read 23:52 EDT.  (The watch is 1 minute and 45 seconds fast compared to Naval Observatory Time on this computer.)   It was east of my postion heading west.  If the the horizon is 9 o'clock and my zenith is 12 o'clock, it was in the 10:30 or 11:00 position when I first watched after I got out of the car.   It was in the 12 o'clock position at 23:52 EDT.  There might have been some zig-zag movement when it was there but it might have been my eye movement.   I tried to check that against the postions of the stars.  There was planet (?) right overhead.  It went by that point a distance of a thumb held at arms length. I had a compass and check it's movement relative to Magnetic North (which is close to true north in Cincinnati) it was heading west at 260 degree approximately. When it got to about my 1 o'clock postion it disappeared.   There was a plane come from the south.  I checked the time as it was 23:59 according to my watch which is fast. Winds were listed as light from FOX19.com.  Weather Channel list temp at 64 degrees, dewpoint 61 degrees relative humity at 90% and visiblity at 10 miles.  Sky is partly cloudy.  Sunset was 9:04 tonight. I thought it might have been a hotair balloon but there was not sound and you can sometimes hear them as the fire up the balloons.   The other idea was that it was one of those kid balloons that use a candle to make rise but I haven't seen one of those since I was a kid.;39.2638999999999;-84.7816999999997
