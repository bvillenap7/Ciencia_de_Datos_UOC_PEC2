So didn't think much of it at first. It got louder apparently as the object approached. When I realized it was not a car.  I immediately ran to the balcony.  Lucky enough to just barely catch a glimpse of it. It was moving very fast. And was maybe only 3 to 600 ft. above me. There was NO WAY THIS WAS A HELICOPTER, AIRPLANE OR ANYTHING THAT WE SEE ALL THE TIME. I do not know what it was. All I know is it was something different. The humming vibration sound it had, did not last as long once it passed overhead. There were lights on it.  It passed over so fast I only had a second if that too see it. I just wish I had gone out immediately when I first heard it!! I really just want to know if anyone else in Harrison, Oh. had heard or seen this Friday night 11/1/19 At 10:34 pm. It was heading from West to East. I have wanted to always see something fro! m somewhere else my entire life!! And I fear that may have been it, and For the most part I missed it. I know without a doubt there are other intelligent beings out there.  I don't know why they don't just make contact.  Or maybe they have and it's all just been covered up over and over.;39.2638999999999;-84.7816999999997
