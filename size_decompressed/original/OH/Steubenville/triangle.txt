I HAD WALKED OUTSIDE FOR AIR AND I SAW TRIANGULAR SHAPED VAPOR COMING TOWARDS ME AT A SLOW STEADY SPEED. I WATCHED FOR A FEW MINUTES BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS THE STEALTH BOMBER BUT WHEN IT GOT DIRECTLY OVERHEAD I REALIZED I COULD SEE THE STARS RIGHT THRU IT! I RAN INTO THE HOUSE & YELLED FOR MY BOYFRIEND WHO CAME OUTSIDE & WATCHED WITH ME. THIS OBJECT CONTINUED TRAVELING IN A WESTWARD DIRECTION WITH THE ONLY VISIBLE THING BEING A VAPOR COMING FROM THE REAR. NO SOUND - NO LIGHTS. THIS MADE A BELIEVER OUT OF MY BOYFRIEND!

Triangle shape, blueish-green lights on the perimeter.  Flew over Ohio River and made the water move, but no sound.  ((1st report));2018-03-19 20:40:00;3-4 minutes;Triangle shape, blueish-green lights on the perimeter.  Flew over Ohio River and made the water move but no sound. My Two son's (12 & 9) and I were driving home from our local mall last night approx. around 8:37 p.m..  My oldest son, who was sitting in the back seat, says to me, Mom, there is something strange in the sky.  I pass it off to be a helicopter or plane, seeing as though we see a good bit of air traffic coming and going from the Pittsburgh airport.   We hit a red light getting ready to turn left (northbound towards home), when my second son, who is sitting in the front seat, reports to me he is now seeing a strange set of lights in the sky, my curiosity peaked, and I asked where they were seeing it?   He says, Right in front, right behind the tree line.  We live in a valley, so there are a lot of heavy wooded area and hills, we also were about to be turning onto a highway that goes right along the Ohio River.  What I see is a VERY bright light through the tree line, I make a joke and say, that it is probably just a helicopter looking for marijuana plants.  I make the left turn onto route 7, and clearly see that this craft is flying above the river.  In our depressed area, we have trains carrying coal that which the tracks line the river, as well as barges who travel on the river.  We can see W.V. across the river and there are little run down steel plants and canning plants that once were up and running.   I slow down on this highway going only 40 mph in a 55 mph zone watching it, I had noticed that the bright white light I once saw, is accompanied by dim whitish lights around the front on the craft.  We roll the windows down and shut the crappy pop music off that my kids insisted we listened to on the way home, and we hear absolutely nothing, but notice that the water is swaying like a boat had just traveled and disturbed the water.  At that point we are shocked and nobody is saying much, we only hear the wind and my car driving down this stretch of empty highway.  It did a drastic turn, something I've never seen a craft of any kind do towards the left, which would be directly over my suv.  It is now out of our sight.  I roll the windows up.  My oldest son asks me what we seen, and I have absolutely no words to tell.  I am only wondering where it went, and if we would see it again.  We drive a mile or so down the road, and notice something else in the sky.  This time we knew it was a plane heading to Pittsburgh with the flashing red lights.  I am telling the boys, that isn't what we just saw, there was no way in hell that was a plane. The strange silence was soon interrupted by the shreek of my oldest son who was now sitting on the driver's side (still in the back seat)  I see it mom, I see it he screams, in excitement.  I look to the left, sure enough it was there moving or hovering.  This time I could see it better.  It was a triangle shape, with the 4-6 smaller dim white lights on the front of the craft including the bigger bright white light on the tip, with blue and greenish lights surrounding the perimeter there were at least 9 separate ones, 3 on each side.  It was dark, but the craft seemed to be a shiny metallic color it wasn't a huge craft, maybe a little bigger than my Honda pilot, just in a perfect triangular shape.  It hovered for approx. 40 seconds, and then seemed to get lower.  What is strange about this sight is, how fast it would be higher up into altitude and then drop down, it did this at least 3 times, so quickly.  It would be in one place, and seem to move over without traveling.  It was significantly  lower than the plane at all times.  It continued to move left without actually flying, before it was right above a semi big hill off in a wooden area.   What happened next was the big kicker.  It seemed to get very low and blend/land into the trees, but I didn't witness any debris or tree limbs flying into the air.  The 3 of us all seen it, watched it land or whatever it was doing and turn the lights out or completely vanished into thin air.  I've never experienced something like this, or seen it with my own eyes, and my 2 kids experienced it with me. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the source of the report, and we found her to be quite sincere, and seemingly quite sober-minded about her sighting.  We suspect that she has recounted the details of her sighting quite accurately.  PD;40.36456;-80.6473088888889
