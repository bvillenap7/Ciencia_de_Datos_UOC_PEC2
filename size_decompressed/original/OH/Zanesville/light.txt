Flash of orange lightning in a cloud and then a bright fast moving light appeared near the cloud.;2007-04-01 20:30:00;around 3 min.;Flash of orange lightning in a cloud and then a bright fast moving light appeared near the cloud. First my mom and I noticed a flash of orange-ish colored lightning in this one cloud. As my mother drove further up the road a bright white light appeared in the sky around the same area as the cloud with the lightning was. It was moving fast and there were no blinking lights to indicate an airplane. I kept watching it when it just disappeared almost as if someone flipped of a light switch that powered the light. There were no clouds in the sky where it vanished the moving light just went out. Not sure if it was a UFO or not but it was very interesting.;39.928475504711;-82.0037814266479
Bright red light.;2014-06-15 21:00:00;3 minutes;I took my dog out for the night, and when I looked up, there was this bright red light did not think much about it.   Keep watching it then it started going into this orange then white as it got bigger it was almost in the trees  in the NNW  and it looked very round  and it keep getting lower.   When I called for people to look and tell me what it could be it got really small and then just looked like a red dot.   This is not the first time I have seen this I seen it earlyer this year  not sure what it is. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Unusual lights observed in the sky;2020-08-08 22:20:00;30 seconds;Unusual lights observed in the sky While walking my dog I observed 2 red lights in the sky north of our home.  The lights were continuous and not blinking.  The lights appeared to be 50-75 feet apart moving independently and rapidly in a southwest direction for approximately 10 seconds before slowing to a stop. After stopping first 1 light slowly faded from sight followed by the other. Approximately 5 seconds after both lights disappeared a third appeared from the same area as the first two, moving more rapidly than the first two in the same direction as the original lights. Upon reaching the same area that the first two lights disappeared the third also slowed to a stop and proceeded to fade from sight. I continued to observe the area for 10 minutes after the last contact, but no further lights were observed .;39.928475504711;-82.0037814266479
