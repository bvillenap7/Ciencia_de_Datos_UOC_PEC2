A round greenish ball of light whitnessed in thge late 90's during daylight;1999-09-01 19:00:00;15 seconds;A round greenish ball of light whitnessed in thge late 90's during daylight My sighting occurred sometime in the Fall between 1997 and 1999.  I cannot remember the exact date of my sighting however I know that it was Fall because it was football season. I was sitting in the bleachers before the start of a football game.  There was one set of bleachers that faced the football field, and behind the football field was a forest.  It was early evening, and there was still plenty of sunlight, not a cloud in the sky.  Out of nowhere a greenish ball of bright light appeared just above the tree line and was perfectly still. It was a solid light, not blinking or anything.  After approx. 10â€“15 seconds, the ball of light shot off to the right faster than I have ever seen anything move.  It moved faster than anything man made could even come close to matching.  From time to time I still talk about it with other former classmates who also witnessed it.  It is my one and only encounter, and I have never formally reported it.  It is something I will never forget and I can still picture it in vivid detail.;39.928475504711;-82.0037814266479
