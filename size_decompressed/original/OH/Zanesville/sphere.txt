Glowing white orb in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the ISS??  PD));2012-06-08 22:15:00;3 minutes;glowing white orb in the sky. For the second night in a row, within an hour of each other, I clearly saw a soft white glowing object high in the air.  I am unsure how high.  It travelled slowly, slower than a typical aircraft.  The first night it did a half a cirlce, then continued north west.   The second night, it was moving very slowly in an eastern direction.  My fiancee noticed it first the second night, but we both saw it both nights.  This was very scary!    Also, no sound at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the ISS??
