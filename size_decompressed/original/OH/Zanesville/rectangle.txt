Very large object w/ white and blue flashing lights..;2003-10-13 23:15:00;3 minutes;Very large object w/ white and blue flashing lights.. I was driving home and looked up and saw very bright white and pale bluish colored lights flashing not to far above the tree lines. I stopped my car and turned it off and watched through the window as the object slowly moved westward. The object made no sound and appeared to be around the size of a football field;39.928475504711;-82.0037814266479
