loud sound coming from water;1995-05-01 22:00:00;2 minutes;loud sound coming from water I am not sure if this falls inthis category or not. My brother and I were fishing at Dillon Dam in Zanesville,Ohio. My brother believes he is Daniel Boone, a real outdoorsman who is scared of nothing. He was in his late 30's, I am 2 years younger. We have fished in this cover for decades, ever since we were young children. The cove itself is only about knee deep as we have waded in it many times. It was dark out that night, cloudy, no stars could be seen. We were bottom fishing, just relaxing,not much talking. All of a sudden, we both heard this tremendous sound. The only thing I can think of is it sounded like a house coming out of the water. It was happening right in front of us though we could not see a thing. Without a word being spoken, both of us immediately ran backwards frrom the water's edge. I looked over at my fearless brother and he had a 25 caliber pistol pulled, aimed at the water (he was a manager of a rest. and carried alot of money so he carried a gun). Both of us just looked at each other and asked what the heck was that, though not in such nice terms. We both basically ran to our poles, grabbed them and reeled them i nwhile running away fro mthe water....  My brother refuses to talk about that incident to this day, and tho we fished there every monday, we did not go back to that spot for 2 months. All I could think of was maybe gas being released, but there are no pipes there and it just seemed so big and loud. It sounded like a house coming out of the water, as the water poured off it....;39.928475504711;-82.0037814266479
Two Unknown Silent Aircraft With Reddish Orange Light Observed Over Zanesville, Ohio.;2013-09-01 21:33:00;2 minutes;Two Unknown Silent Aircraft With Reddish Orange Light Observed Over Zanesville Ohio On September 1, 2013, at 21:33 eastern daylight savings time, my brother and I were sitting out on my front porch. My brother suddenly stopped his conversation and said look, look  I looked at the south western sky near our hospital at only 1000-1200 feet or so we observed a silent craft that we could not identify the shape of the craft but both commented on the craft's reddish orange single light that really did not appear to have enough illumination to really see much ahead of itself. That's when we realized that there were actually two crafts flying in offset formation. We saw the trailing craft first and then observed the lead craft.  At that height, we should have heard some kind of engine noise leading or trailing.  Neither craft had the usual red and green blinking light or bright white strobe that you see with typical aircraft.  As the crafts moved overhead, we went around to the back deck and by that time, the crafts had accelerated almost as if they knew we were observing them.  The reddish orange light caused me to remember a similar craft that my daughter had observed back in 2004 in October.  Very unusual, I wonder if the reddish orange light was some sort of thermal imaging or night vision equipment.  It might put one in mind of a dark room developing lamp or maybe some type of mylar photo correction film. Just speculation at this point.;39.928475504711;-82.0037814266479
