V shaped object w/red lights;2007-01-03 18:00:00;3 minutes;V shaped object w/red lights On Wendsday evening at aroung 6:00 pm my 2 children ages 13 and 8 and I were headed for a friends hpose for supper. We were coming up on a stoplight and I glanced up into the sky as a frequently do and I noticed what I thought at first to be an odd arrangement of stars. I asked my son what he thought and he replied those are not stars mom they are moving. I pulled over so we could get a better look and as it came closer we could see 5 red objects in a V shape formation. We all got out to see better. It was up very high..higher than a jet normally flies but it appeared even from that high up to be the span of half a football field in width. We could not tell if the objects were connected or flying solo but they did stay in a perfect V shape and did not appear to be moving seperatly from one another. There was no sound that we could hear either. The only object to change was the one in the lead and after a couple minutes started going from red to white. The other ones stayed red the entire time. It was going in a north eastern direction at a very sloe rate of speed. I have no idea what we saw that night, and I am no expert, but it caught my attention and I know it was not a plane.;39.928475504711;-82.0037814266479
