Four lights in square shape moving quickly formed into a straight line and disappeared.;2013-12-26 19:00:00;4-8 seconds;Four lights in square shape moving quickly formed into a straight line and disappeared. A friend looked up at the sky and thought he saw a shooting star but realized there were four lights in a square shape with another light in the center.   Then it formed into 4 lights in a straight line.  He told me to look up and I saw the four lights in a straight line moving quickly above me.   It made no sound which i thought was suspicious because it seemed kind of close.   I watched for 5 seconds before it flickered and disappeared.
