Red/Orange fire ball, Baseball size with sparks, smoke, and trail.;1998-12-07 04:30:00;5 - 10 seconds;Red/Orange fire ball, Baseball size with sparks, smoke, and trail. While driving in my truck going east on I - 76, directly in front of me appeared a rapidly moving red/orange fire ball. It was traveling in a south south westerly direction. It apeared to be baseball size, with a long tail, and it was emmiting a lot of sparks. It was very bright making a smoke trail visible.It was taveling at about a 30 degree angle.I dismissed it as the most spectacular meteor that I have ever seen , untill hearing a lot of people were seeing the same thing on the west coast, on the Art Bell show you were a gust on in mid Dec.;41.1388999999999;-81.8629000000001

The sparkling fragments traveled Eastward towards me as a whole group. Once the items passed almost overhead and slightly North they took on a greenish-yellow color and appeared to be several fireballs traveling in a train-like fashion. I could not hear any sound from them. They continued to move quickly across the sky and disappeared into the Eastern horizon, slightly North. I was waiting in the drive thru line at the Dairy Queen in Medina Ohio and the passenger with me said what do we have coming here? I looked across the vehicle and out the passenger window and noticed what looked to me as fireworks. It was a cold November day and I remember thinking to myself that this was an odd time of the year to see fireworks. The colors were flickering blue and purple and began traveling toward us in a cluster. The two of us were astonished! We both got out of the vehicle and looked toward the colored fragments. As the fragments began to pass overhead they took on a greenish yellow color and appeared to be fireballs with tails traveling in a row. Smaller fire balls could be seen in the tails of the larger fireballs that were in front. They moved swiftly accross the sky and seemed to disappear into the Eastern horizon. Neither of us could believe what we had just seen. There were other customers in line behind us that sort of looked quickly to the sky almost as if they wondered what we were looking at but I don't believe they acctually saw the fireballs. I was on my lunch break and was angry that I had left my digital camera at work. The image is etched in my mind forever. I saw a brief article on the evening news that someone was calling it space junk and another an asteroid. I heard on the radio that people were calling in reports of a sighting and they were telling us that it was part of the Leonid meteor shower that was due to be seen the following night. This did not occur in the constilation of Leo. I have yet to get any kind of explanation of it. One of my fellow workers told me that his daughter had seen the same event and seemed very puzzled about what she had seen. My work friend told her that it could have been part of the meteor shower but after what I had told him I witnessed, he realy didn't know what it was. I realy wish I new for sure!;41.1388999999999;-81.8629000000001
Two orange glowing objects, 5 minutes apart.;2013-08-10 22:00:00;5 minutes;Two orange glowing objects, 5 minutes apart My wife and I saw two glowing objects while sitting on our front porch at about 10pm.  I even recorded it on my phone.  The  first one came by, no sound, moving slowly then shot away into the distance.  5 minutes later another one came by taking the same path and doing exactly the same thing.  I pointed them out to my neighbors who witnessed them as we'll. Sent from my iPad;41.1388999999999;-81.8629000000001

The first came the east over the tree line then headed north and disappeared. Within a minute another one appeared and followed the exact same path.  Then followed by a third one and finally a fourth.  Tthe last two took a slightly different path after appearing.  The last one dropped smaller objects from it which looked like sparks intermittently.  It dropped or sparked seven times.  people don't see this but maybe once in a lifetime I've seen this twice n the last 30 days?  Why isn't local media getting reports on this?;41.1388999999999;-81.8629000000001
2 fireballs, same pattern, silent.;2013-11-05 20:20:00;3 minutes;2 fireballs, same pattern, silent. On 11/5/13 around 8:20pm in Medina City (Medina County), I saw a red/orange fireball going across my window from south to north.  I went outside because I knew there would be a second fireball as I have seen this twice since August.  Sure enough, about 2 min later the same kind of fireball following the same path went by.  Sighting is silent. 	Previous sightings were around August 31st near Lake Erie and October 5th in Mohican (Knox County).  Different times of night.  I have a video, but itâ€™s not very clear as the object was moving too quickly. 	I would say it was a Chinese lantern but it was moving too fast and following the exact pattern, also I question as to why there would only be two each time.;41.1388999999999;-81.8629000000001
