Unusually bright and red orange in color for a plane.   Went outside to observe and noted it was slowly moving but slightly erratic side to side then stopped.  There was no sound heard during this time as we normally do with jets that pass above.   We live in a rural area and it is normally quiet and dark because of no street lights.   As we watched it as it was stationary it appeared to change to a lighter color, and became smaller as we assumed it gained altitude and disappeared.  The event took place in about 5 minutes. I am a  Physical therapist  and my husband is a commercial pilot and we have never observed red anything like this before.;41.1388999999999;-81.8629000000001
