Slow moving, low UFO seen in Medina, OH 01/09/21;2021-01-09 20:30:00;20 seconds;Slow moving, low UFO seen in Medina, OH 01/09/21 I was outside walking my dog in front of my house at about 9:30 at night. It was a very clear night. I was facing East looking up at the stars. All of a sudden it got eerily quiet. I notice that coming from the South heading North, going about 10 mph, is a dark ship about 200 yards above the ground and about 100 yards in front of me and my dog. There was no sound. No lights. It looked like there was a cloaking aspect to the ship... like it had the nighttime sky on the underside of the ship. But I could see the contours of the ship while it continued a perfectly steady speed due North. It had no wings. From my POV, it was a cigar shape about 200 yards long and about 30-40 yards tall.  No plane-like characteristics that I could see. It was hovering, no sound, going very very slow. I had a very bad feeling the whole time watching it. I watched it move from the South traveling North for about 20 seconds till it was out of my sight line due to trees and surroundi! ng homes blocking my view. I then immediately went inside the house and got my boyfriend, and we came outside to look for it but it was gone.;41.1388999999999;-81.8629000000001
