I got off work at 7:00pm and to my left I saw a bright light. I turned down the road to see what it was. I saw a very bright light through the trees and as I got closer it made a loud humming sound so that I could hardly hear my cd player. I looked down at my cd player and the trak timer was going so fast that I couldn't make out the numbers. I drove a bit further and in a field behind the trees I saw this gigantic craft the shape of 2 pyramids stuck together at the bottoms. At every corner there were bright lights so light it was almost like daylight. I rushed home to tell my mom and she said it took me about an hour to get home when it mormally takes 20 minutes and according to the clock in my car it only took me 20 minutes.;41.1388999999999;-81.8629000000001
