Black Triangle followed by Orange Orb.;2000-12-17 19:30:00;3-5minutes;Black Triangle followed by Orange Orb. Saw lights coming across Freeway.  Looked up and seen a black triangle and a Orange Orb following in a Zig-Zag movement.  There was no sound as you would hear with a Jet or other Airplanes.  Three lights.  One at each point of the triangle.  The Orange Orb was about 1/4 mile behind the Triangle.  We watched the best we could since we were traveling on the Freeway.  It just kept going until we couldn't see it anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means to say the incident took place in December 2000, not 2001, but that is an assumption  We have changed the date here.
