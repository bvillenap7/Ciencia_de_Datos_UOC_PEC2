January 4 2003-lights in rearview mirror;2003-01-04 21:57:00;5-7 minutes;January 4 2003-lights in rearview mirror A friend of mine and I were going to see a movie, when in his rearview mirror, we saw flashing lights. He pulled over thinking it was a cop, but the lights kept going. It obviously wasn't close enough to touch. It was lower than an airplane, but higher than birds fly normally. The light was so bright though that it kinda freaked us out. It followed the street we were on for 2 blocks then quickly (with a bright falsh) took off to the left over a tree line. At the next street to the left we turned but the thing was out of our vision. We finished our date early, both due to splitting headaches and nose bleeds. (unusual for both) Since then, we have both been abnormally cold, no matter how many layers of clothing of blankets we put on or the temperature of our surroundings.

Hovering light moving up, down & side to side then having a fix placement in the sky.  Police contacted.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2014-09-26 21:00:00;Hour;Hovering light moving up, down & side to side then having a fix placement in the sky. Police Dept contacted. While taking my dogs outside I noticed a light in the sky above the tree line in front of my parent's house on Huffman.  While I stood watching it I noticed that it would move slowly up then down, stop, then move left to right slowly stopping again.   I stood out there for about 15 mins till' I asked my mother to come out & watch it.  She agreed that it was unusual then went back inside.  When 30+ mins had past from when I first noticed the light, & still continuing to do the same movements I called the Medina Police Dept.  About 15 mins later & missing my driveway about 3-4 times the officer pulled up, by then the light had moved below the tree line so he was unable to see it.  He took my report, said it was probably someone's drone then went on his way.   A week or so after I saw a similar light in the back yard, but since I didn't post asking if anyone else in Medina was witnessing the same thing I don't have a date & time.   I didn't contact the police dept the second time after seeing how they pretty much took it as a joke the first time.  This was not the first time I had experienced lights like this in Medina, when I was in high school I was driving on Marcs Rd & pulled over in the subdivision on the corner of Marcs & Fenn & sat for awhile watching the same movement till it disappeared.;41.1388999999999;-81.8629000000001
Unexplained star in Medina, Ohio, suddenly moves, then takes a 90 degree turn, and flies east.;2015-06-16 00:00:00;30 min or more;Unexplained star in Medina, Ohio, suddenly moves, then takes a 90 degree turn, and flies east. This took place between the hours of 9-10pm.   Feeling tired, I went to bed at 9pm, leaving my husband to watch television.  My eyes were drawn to the outside, as the flashing of the fireflies was quite striking to see.  As it grew darker, the fireflies were more noticeable.   I decided to rise from my bed and sit on the floor, resting my arms on the window sill to watch them.  Our window provides an eastern view and for a change, I noticed the night sky was clear and I could see the stars.  Not having done this in a while, I looked for constellations.  My eyes were drawn to a very bright star in the sky, positioned over our yard.   I also noticed a jet flying in from the south with its blinking lights and it was too far up in the sky to hear it.   Again, I was drawn to that bright star and wondered if it was a planet.  After a while, it started to MOVE.  It was closer to the earth than was the jet, because the jet passed behind it.  I thought my imagination had kicked in, or that perhaps it simply was the earth's rotation causing this movement.  I used the window pane to gauge the movement and YES, the star WAS moving!  It moved in a southern direction then STOPPED.   The star took a 90 degree turn away from me and headed east at a steady speed.  I watched it until it disappeared, which took very little time.   The last time I had seen anything similar to this was in 2013 around 4:45am.  I was driving up Fenn Road to Weymouth Road, on my way to work.  The object traveled in a southern direction then turned east.  This did not look like a star, but was a glowing orange color and had no flashing lights or sound.;41.1388999999999;-81.8629000000001
