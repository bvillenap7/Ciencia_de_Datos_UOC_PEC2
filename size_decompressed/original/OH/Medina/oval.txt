It was not moving and was not making any sounds. I then went home to get my brother and went back out looking for it. When we went back out we saw the shape with two lights. One light disappeared, and the object became dim. Then the object traveled quickly across the sky and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

At first I thought wow someone put a lot of time into that, then I thought maybe the new fancy display on the blimp (but no Goodyear blimp attached).  No sound, traveling under clouds. I called for my son to come out, and he saw it too, but now much farther away, the flame like appearance, had him guessing rocket, jet, but not quite right for either.   Too fast , for a RC too slow for a meteorite, flickering, watched for what seemed a minute till it seemed to go up through clouds somewhere towards Cleveland, OH. When I first saw it, it was almost but not directly overhead and it had the appearance of being covered with tiles of flickering but mostly orange lighted panels, but with enough granularity to make it appear wrapped in led displays, like active camouflage gone crazy. Very flame like pattern.  Not a Chinese lantern    No sound, overcast skies that cleared somewhat an hour later.  I see much Cleveland air traffic but this was not that.;41.1388999999999;-81.8629000000001
