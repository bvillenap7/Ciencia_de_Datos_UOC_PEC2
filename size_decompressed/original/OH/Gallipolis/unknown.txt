Noticed a blue light bathing a barn outback.  It flashed many times, & covered this barn in the light.;2010-08-15 00:00:00;Several minutes;Woke up at 420am, & decided to check on a cat that had new kittens, & was staying on my back porch.  I looked down at the cats, and noticed a blue light bathing a barn outback.  It flashed many times, & covered this barn in the light.   I yelled for my husband eno came to the door, & witnessed along with me this light changed very color, & literally zip to the ground.  It spun in a circle,& then moved to approximately 5 ft into the air where it exploded into 3 separate small white lights.  It spun for approximately 30 seconds,& then shot up into the sky, & exploded into many different white lights.   We walked outside to watch for anything else.  Maybe half a hour passed when one single white light zipped above our house, & exploded.  Nothing more after that.  My husband agrees with me this was not something of this earth.   Thanks for allowing me to report this.;38.8148;-82.229
