I saw two airplanes following and keeping up with a large white ball of light.  A few seconds later the white light released two more smaller white lights.  One of the smaller lights flew above and one flew below when they were released.  It looked like a triangle shaped formation with the original light slightly ahead. They all flew about the same speed. I heard the sound of the two planes.  I watched until I couldn't see them anymore. I was at home standing with my door open when I saw this.  What caught my eye in the first place were the two planes flying side by side, which does happen from time to time but usually during the day.  And these planes did not sound like jets either, much more quiet.  They all flew approx at an altitude of a Cessna.  I was pointed West and the crafts were moving from South to North.;38.8148;-82.229
