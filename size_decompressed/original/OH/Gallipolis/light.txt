Looked like a star at first.;2017-07-16 23:30:00;2 minutes;Looked like a star at first. While sky watching my husband and I were looking at an extremely bright star to the west.  As we watched the light,  the star intensified and started to move away slowly at first and faster, growing smaller until disappearing.   We were pretty shocked, neither of us had seen any thing like it before.  Like I said, it looked just like a star for quite a bit.   It was no plane, we see them all the time and know what they look like.;38.8148;-82.229
