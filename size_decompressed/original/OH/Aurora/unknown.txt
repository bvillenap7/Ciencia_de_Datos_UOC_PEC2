Reddish light in a triangular formation rising in the sky then dimming and disappearing.;2014-09-14 00:25:00;2 minutes;Reddish light in a triangular formation rising in the sky then dimming and disappearing I was walking on the sidewalk heading north in my neighborhood.  It was approximately 00:25 on 09/14/2014.   The sky was clear with many stars visible.  The houses here are spaced apart with some lighting on the houses and driveways and no street lights in the area where I was standing.  I noticed three reddish lights in a triangular formation in the northern sky seeming to rise and with a brighter light than the stars.  They continued to rise until they were no longer visible.  There were no contrails or sounds.   As soon as they seemed to dim then disappear another two appeared which were in a vertical orientation.  These too rose into the sky and then dimmed and disappeared. I used my phone to video these and while dim I think provide a decent image. I am a current airline pilot and I have never seen anything like this.;41.3179;-81.3471000000003
