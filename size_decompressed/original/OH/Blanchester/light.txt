I notice the 3 orange lights that come on in the sky that were in a straight line.;2018-05-19 21:30:00;30 seconds;I was at a friend's house talking with his family and him and his wife were on the couch i was in recliner his son was standing at the door looking back at us talking, im looking out the window thst is beside his son at the garage across the street then i notice the 3 orange lights that come on in the sky that were in a straight line which were not lower than a cell tower but not higher that a plane would fly and i thought it was a reflection on the window so i moved my head to make sure and about the time i realized it was in the sky another set of 3 orange lights came on to the left of the first set which were also in a straight line.  I immediately jumped up and and started to yell holy smokes and ran to the door with my friends son who also was seeing it and then my friend and his wife came running and saw these lights that were not moving at all and the longer i looked the more i noticed the lights werent steady like a light you flick on and off it was like a fire.   Finally after about 20-30 seconds of amazement, the lights did a quick fade to sky.  my friend's house is on tucker road and the lights appeared to be somewhere over fayetteville.;39.3033;-83.977
