While sitting outside star-gazing at approximately 18:40 on Dec. 5, 2012, my husband and I (both teachers) observed three orange spheres in the southeastern sky about 15 degrees above the horizon.  At the first, two appeared but then the one on the right disappeared.  One then immediately appeared on the left of the sphere remaining.  These remaining two spheres then disappeared one at a time.  All were in a straight line, parallel to the horizon.  This event lasted a total of maybe 10 seconds.;39.3033;-83.977
