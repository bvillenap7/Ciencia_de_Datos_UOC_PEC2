We frequently travel this road in the dark between Cleveland and Zanesville, Ohio, and have never seen anything of the sorts ever.   It was low to the ground maybe right above the tree line and was very very large.  Larger than a semi-truck.  It also looked as though it might have had landing feet of some type.  No this was not a drone.;40.4028;-81.593
