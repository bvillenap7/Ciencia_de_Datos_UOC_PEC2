PLEASE NOTE - I AM A RETIRED PHYSICIAN - AND FORMER PILOT. JULY 7th, Sunday afternoon approx. 2:00 pm esds time while working in my back yard, I heard a distant popping sound coming from over my head.  This caused me to look up.  At first I had a difficult time finding the source of the sound.  I looked ahead of the sound - as one does for a jet at altitude - the object was approx. 10 degrees ahead of the returned sound - using 180 degrees from horizon to horizon as the parameter.  The entire event lasted slightly less than 5 minutes.  The object's heading was WNW to ESE.  It also appeared to roll once - outside loop type - not barrel roll.  No vapor trail was present.  My guess at it's altitude was well over 30,000 feet AGL.  It was very large and moving at a constant rate.  You should be able to estimate size and height of the object between the zero magnification photo and the leaves on the oak trees in the various photos.  I have the photos saved to cd in tiff. format should you need them.  You may contact me via my E-Mail address which follows.          ((e-address deleted))          This was no hot air balloon.                       Sincerely, Dr. ((deleted))    I am e-mailing photos to   director@ufocenter.com as requested today.;41.3991652880352;-81.3251709010342
