It was huge, I couldn't believe what i has seen. I was sitting outside on my back porch smoking a cigarette when I looked up to see the stars and I saw this HUGE object in the sky. On the front (assuming by the direction it was headed)  it had a little yellowish/white light. In the Center of the object there was a tiny white light and then a red flashing light right above it. At the end of the object there was a green light on one side and a red light on the other. It was much to long to be a plane and it was going way to slow. It toke 10 minutes for it to get out of my sight range. It was also making a low buzzing sound from what I could here, it was very quiet. I couldn’t see anything else but the lights, and I could tell that it was a huge object. It was extraordinarily  long, I couldn’t even believe what I had seen. The whole time I was thinking what is that? I thought maybe a blimp but it was to long and what would a blimp be doing out at 9:00 at night. I called one of my friends and explained the object to him and he had no idea what it was and told me it could have been a UFO and to report the object.;41.3991652880352;-81.3251709010342
