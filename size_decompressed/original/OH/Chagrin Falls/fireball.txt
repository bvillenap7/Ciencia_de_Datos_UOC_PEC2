My wife, aunt, son and myself witnessed a very bright amber/orange ball moving at about the rate of a jet plane descending toward a local airport.  It flew below a thick cloud deck and was in clear view.  There were no flashing lights, or headlights or the typical red & green nav lights we see on planes.  It was silent and appeared as a fireball for lack of a better term.  The light it emitted was constant until the last 2 or 3 seconds of the event.  It traveled from the south, due north directly overhead.   We watched it approaching, move overhead and then away from us - again, no flashing lights or landing lights of any kind.  As it flew toward the north, it got dimmer and dimmer until it just vanished - like a match burning out.   I might surmise it was a meteor but it was below the cloud deck and unobscurred.  A meteor at such a low altitude would be moving extremely fast.  This object moved at a rate similar to an airplane we saw concurrently! coming from the east, and at a higher altitude.  So this object was moving slower than a jet coming in on approach.;41.3991652880352;-81.3251709010342
