Bright white light which appeared and disapeared in northern sky, in approx. one minute.;2000-08-30 21:10:00;1 minute;Bright white light which appeared and disapeared in northern sky, in approx. one minute. This was second sighting in one week. First occured Monday Aug 28 at 21:15 local time. Second sighting was Aug 30 at 21:10 local time. Both were exactly the same. From my position in west central Ohio, a bright light appreared approx 35 degrees from horizon due north. Light appreared from pin point to become a very bright light. Brighter than any star visible. The light lasted for approx 30-40 seconds the faded away to a pin point, then vanished. On Monday the 28th I noted it, and thought hard about making a report. The second sighting on the 30th convinced me this was not any type of aircraft or natural phenonmenon. I am a 42 year old male. Married. Own my own home. Currently employed full time, and with my current job 10 years. I have eight years active duty in the US Coast Guard as a Quartermaster (navigator) and have been trained to make true and keen observations. In 42 years I have never seen anything that remotely resembles this. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what it was the witness observed.  However, a regular reader of our posted reports has cited the fact that an Iridium was scheduled to flare ( Magnitude:  -3) in the northern sky, as viewed from Troy, at 31 degrees above the horizontal plane, at 2109 hrs., on this date.  The description is not entirely consistent with a sighting of an Iridium satellite, but we cite the coincidence of the two events.  Our thanks to Lexy.  PD));40.0413999999993;-84.2022999999992
Pulsating red light over Troy, Ohio on 18 Sept 2011.;2011-09-18 00:30:00;10-12 minutes;Pulsating red light over Troy, Ohio on 18 Sept 2011. Shortly after midnight on the morning of 18 Sept 2011, I was driving south on Interstate 75 heading toward Dayton, Ohio.  As I approached the city of Troy, I noticed a red pulsating (maybe flickering is a better word) light that appeared to be almost hovering over the interstate.  I first thought it was a light on a cell or other type of tower, but the closer I got I noticed it seemed to be moving slowly to the east.  I'd estimate the altitude of the light to have been no more than a couple thousand feet as I drove under/by it.  There was no apparent noise associated with it, and I'm sure it wasn't a conventional aircraft or helicopter. As I recall, the weather that night/morning was fairly clear, with just enough haze to allow the red light to illuminate the haze around it with a dull red glow.  As I continued south, I continued to observe the light in my rearview mirrors until I eventually lost sight of it.  I'm unsure if the light extinguished, if it left the area, or if I lost sight of it due to the terrain as I continued south.   Total time of my obersvation was probably 10-12 minutes. I made a point to check the newspapers and TV news the next day in Dayton (about 20 south of Troy) to see if there was any mention of the light, but found none.  My thought was it was probably a Chinese lantern, but then I noticed the Sept 25 sighting in Dayton on the NUFORC data base that sounded almost exactly like what I'd seen.;40.0413999999993;-84.2022999999992
