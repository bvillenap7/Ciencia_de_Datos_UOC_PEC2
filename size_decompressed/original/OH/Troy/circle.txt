Not fireworks.;2013-07-04 22:00:00;2 minutes (each);watching fireworks when saw 3 round red lights in a different sector of sky.  No they were Not fireworks!  The direction changed from straight up then headed towards us and changed direction to straight up again.  No trailing light from a firework display or diminishing of size or brightness.  The spacing was uniform and constant for each direction change.  These lights did not fade out but disappeared into the clouds.  A few minutes later 2 more identical lights appeared went straight up, went left, went right, then straight up and went into the same spot in the clouds.  A short time later another group of 3 went straight up at an angle and into the exact spot as the first 2 groups. I have been around professional fireworks people and grew up military so I know the difference. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

It appeared as an off white light and was so large and bright I thought I was looking at a planet.  When I looked closer, I noticed it was slowly moving in a southerly direction.   As I continued to watch, within a couple of seconds I noticed it began to dim in brightness and looked smaller to me.  Within a couple of seconds it disappeared.   No cloud cover present in the area and it did not display characteristics of a plane.;40.0413999999993;-84.2022999999992
