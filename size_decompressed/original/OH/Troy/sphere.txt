It was a beautiful day and the sky was clear.  A bright light caught my eye in the sky.  It appeared to be sphere-like.  It reminded me of a very big star during the day. It was metallic in color. It moved slowly to the right and stopped.  They it slowly moved left and again stopped.  I knew this could not be a plane!! I pulled over to the side of the road to watch.  After a few seconds it rose straight up into the air and disappeared.  I have never seen anything like this in my life!;40.0413999999993;-84.2022999999992
Large brite orb moving at high speed buzz's house in Troy, Ohio.;2012-11-11 02:30:00;4 seconds;Large brite orb moving at high speed buzz's house in Troy Ohio. My daughter was spending the night at a friends house just outside of Troy Ohio.  At around 2:30am on a very dark night with few clouds, she was standing on the drive way when she saw a very bright round object the size of a house streak past the house at an extreme speed and low altitude and then it was gone. It scared her so much she sought shelter in a ditch.   The neighbors across the street reported seeing the object on a different night.  She described the object as a round orb the size of a house leaving a streak, very brite and white.  Her friend was in the back yard at the time and I do not know if she saw the object.   My daughter is 16 and drug free.  We go camping every weekend in Celina near an airport in the spring, summer, and fall.  She is used to the night sky, and has never reported anything like this before.  What I find odd, is she was scared.  So I am convinced she saw something out of the ordinary.;40.0413999999993;-84.2022999999992
A sphere with several red and white lights, hovering at first and then flew out of sight at lightning speed!;2014-01-17 22:35:00;3 minutes;A sphere with several red and white lights, hovering at first and then flew out of sight at lightning speed! The  object had several red and white lights.  All blinking.  I noticed it while a a stop sign.  I was just hovering.  Maybe for about 1 minute.  Then it moved very slowly but only a very short distance in which it hovered again.  This time is was very brief and then it just started moving.  Moving faster then any jet that I have ever seen and trust me my father worked for the Air Force.  I know what I saw and what I saw was not a regular craft that we see In the sky on a day to day basis!;40.0413999999993;-84.2022999999992
