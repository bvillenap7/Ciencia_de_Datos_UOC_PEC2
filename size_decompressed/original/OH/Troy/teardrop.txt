I was walking in a parking lot on the north side of the levee in Troy, Ohio around 10:15 p.m. after leaving a concert in Hobart Arena.  It was a clear night and I was looking at the stars when I witnessed an unidentified flying object.  The closest object I can say it was shaped like was a bullet.  It glowed bluish-white and moved very quickly in a direct line north to south for about 2 seconds prior to vanishing before reaching the horizon.  I was walking with my girlfriend and her mother but I was the only one that witnessed it that I'm aware of.;40.0413999999993;-84.2022999999992
