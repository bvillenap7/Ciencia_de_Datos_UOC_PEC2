Thought it was a stealth fighter maybe at first, but I passed it in my car at 50 mph. And it was under 1000 ft over town. Had a definite sharp edge triangle shape. Wasn't a helicopter. Not a plane, at least not one with wings. And i spent 2 days researching all flight tracking data i could find. There were no planes. My wife and I were out looking for elusive toilet paper because of the covid 19 tp hoarding. My point is: Not many planes were flying in those early virus days. We are near Wright-Patt. (20) miles. So we've seen planes.. Pictures don't do it justice but it was dark cloudy and raining...... of course.;40.0413999999993;-84.2022999999992
