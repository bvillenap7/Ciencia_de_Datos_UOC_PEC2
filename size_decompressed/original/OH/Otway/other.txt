We watch them for a good ten minutes until they stared to move away. One was about 150 feet across while the other was about 100 feet across.We new we had to follow to see which direction they were headed.

They seemed to be several miles away from us.The roads in my area are very snakey andup and down hilly areas. We were still able to keep them in sight for a good half an hour. When we reach St Rt.32 They seem to pick up speed and in North-East direction was lost  in the dark nite skys. The nite was clear and it was a cold  calm nite for the records .;38.852;-83.2222
