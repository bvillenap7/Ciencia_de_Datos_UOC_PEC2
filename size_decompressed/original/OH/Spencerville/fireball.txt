Several large fireballs over Ohio, near country side.;2016-06-17 22:47:00;~20 minutes;Several large fireballs over Ohio, near country side. I was walking south in town.  I seen a falling star bright blue that broke up.  The direction was North to south.  I then headed one block west one block south and 20 feet west then south.  I decided to sit out and watch for more.  That is when I seen the FIREBALL in the sky low altitude with a cruising speed faster than a patrol plane.  There was no noise.  The Flame effect was close to a hot air balloon at night but the flame was large,constant and the speed somewhat intense in comparison.  There were approximately 15 FIREBALLS that appeared to launch from the east that seemed to have a trajectory.  They turned south southwest at approximately the same area in the sky.  I have 4 video's from my Smartphone couldn't keep up with all of the FIREBALLS as they were systematically appearing over the eastern tree line and fading into the south western direction.  According to video time on a pair that I caught, visual time lasted 5 minutes.  All appears to be the same diameter, speed, elevation.  I gave up trying to record all of them do to the night sky.  The moon and neighbors porch lights were the only viable background.  My Droid Turbo did not pick up the orange flame color or the actual visual distance,diameter and speed.   I am a 40 something person with a 12 year background in automotive.  If hot air balloons travel this fast, I've never seen any like these during the day.;40.7038;-84.3432
