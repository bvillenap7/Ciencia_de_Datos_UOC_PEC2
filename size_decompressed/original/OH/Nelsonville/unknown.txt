I asked my daughter Did you see that? she replied, Yeah, what was that?  My answer was I don't know after driving about 500 yards or so another set flew across the sky from right to left, there was not any hovering nor was there any sound and my car windows were down.  There were no less that 3 large red lights in a triangular formation, with one smaller white light.;39.456;-82.2299
