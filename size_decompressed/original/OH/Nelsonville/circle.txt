Unidentifiable object observed over Nelsonville, Ohio.;2011-06-11 21:50:00;2 mins.;Unidentifiable object observed over Nelsonville, Ohio. We were outside and noticed an orange, circular object moving at a moderate rate of speed that appeared to be on fire.  As it moved across the sky, it started flickering.  After about 20 seconds of flickering, it went black but we could still see the object continuing across the sky until we lost sight at the tree line.;39.456;-82.2299
