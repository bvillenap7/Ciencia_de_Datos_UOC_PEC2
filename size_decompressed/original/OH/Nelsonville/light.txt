I was facing south east and the light moved from my right to left under the moon and then stopped and went back to my right but this time over the moon. I didnt think it was a meteor or anything. It moved too fast for any of our aircraft or any that i know of. It did not leave any kind of streak or trail, but just a focused light point that was much bigger than a star in the sky is. I dont think this is an alien spaceship, just something weird in the sky.;39.456;-82.2299
