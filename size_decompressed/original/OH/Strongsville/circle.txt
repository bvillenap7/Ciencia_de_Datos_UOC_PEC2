Circle of red lights flying smoothly and low with no sound and hovered for a bit before moving on.;2011-07-06 22:25:00;2-3 minutes;Circle of red lights flying smoothly and low with no sound and hovered for a bit before moving on My fiancé and I were just getting home from seeing a movie Saturday night on July 16, 2011.  It was approximately 10:20.  My fiancé was parking the car in the garage.  I had gotten out of the car in the driveway before he pulled into the garage, as it is a tight fit. As he was parking the car, I saw from the southwest direction, something flying in sky with red lights.  Whatever it was was flying at the same constant speed like a plane would and was smoothly flying like a plane would.  It was flying low.  At first, I thought it was something like how a small plane would fly with advertisement attached to it, but at night.  However, when it was approaching nearer and then overhead, it was a circle of red lights with no advertisement.  I could not make out a shape or form as it was at night, but could make out a circle of red lights.  My fiancé then came out onto the driveway after parking the car.  We stood and watched the lights wondering what we were seeing. We watched these lights for probably a couple of minutes.  There was no sound at all. The lights didn’t change color as far as I could tell.  The lights looked constant to me.  They looked like a blur of red lights…like the glare you would have after coming home from the eye doctor after dark and after having your eyes dilated. The lights moved steady at a normal plane speed for awhile going into the northeast direction.  Before it got past the trees where we could no longer see it, it seemed to hover for a while before moving on again and out of our site beyond the trees that obstructed the rest of our view. We have no clue what we saw.;41.3184774661515;-81.8327353965183
