Red and green cylinder object  standing almost stationery with slight, jerky motions.;2005-08-06 23:50:00;1Hour;Red and green cylinder object  standing almost stationery with slight, jerky motions. This was seen on the 5th as well as the 6th.  We thought it was a star in the sky but after further observation noticed it was moving slightly so we got our binoculars.  On the 5th it was more clear.  With our binoculars we could see the the red and green lights flashing around the cylinder.  It remained very stationery for about an hour moving slightly in all directions.  Finally it just shot up and disappeared.  We attempted to take pictures with our digital and video camera but it was at too far a distance to be done.;41.3184774661515;-81.8327353965183
