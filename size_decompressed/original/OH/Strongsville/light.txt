It started off almost right above me and ended up all the way across the sky and then seemed to hit something and made a 90 degree turn;2004-05-14 22:30:00;6 seconds or so;Ok im not giving any personal information, i dont want to be on the news and dont want people to think im crazy. It was 10:30 at night on friday may 14 in the parking lot of Cleats. Me and 4 others just got done eating and watching a band (Didnt Drink). We stood outside the car for 15 minutes and waited for someone. I just looked in the sky for no reason and saw 3 stars kinda next to each other. I must have looked at it for maybe about a minute and then the star (or what ever) on the left took off at an incredible speed. I emediatly pointed and said WTF and only 2 of my friends caught it. I have never seen anything travel at that speed before. It was at zero to who knows how fast in a split second. Thats not the scary part, it started off almost right above me and ended up all the way across the sky and then seemed to hit something and made a 90 degree turn north and disappeared. It was almost like it hit a ball and bounced off. It was oranger (if thats a word) then the stars it was by. I dont believe in aliens and i dont believe the US has anything capable of doing that. I feel it was just a unexplained mystery that has to do with space. Maybe a star getting sucked into a black hole. I dont have pictures or videos and didnt see a shape just a colored light.It also seemed verry far away, (Like a star) not like a plane. Call me crazy, your not the first. My friend said it moved in a back and forth motion but I think it just went straight.  Please Email me if you had any other reports about this or like it.  Thanks;41.3184774661515;-81.8327353965183
bright lights spotted in the middle of the little dipper in strongsville OH  9/24 at exactly 9:45 pm;2008-09-24 21:45:00;20 seconds;bright lights spotted in the middle of the little dipper in strongsville OH  9/24 at exactly 9:45 pm I looked up and said hey what are those bright lights doing in the middle of the little dipper, everybody looked up and said wow,then the lights started to dim then I realized they were moving at an unimaginable speed!  They dimmed at the same time and were gone at the same time.  One light was not brighter but smaller.  Brighter then any star or planet I'v ever seen.  I dont want to say this but we are covinced it was something not human!;41.3184774661515;-81.8327353965183
