I was outside with two friends enjoying the night sky in a hot tub, no alcohol or drugs involved.  I am a 22 year old chemical engineering student and was with my 20 year old girlfriend who is a dental hygienist, along with her friend who is attending college as well.  We were all staring at the night sky, and actually watched an airplane crawl across the sky from northeast to southwest and discussed how fast the aircraft was going.  Only moments later, all three of us witnessed a blue, turquoise stream of light absolutely fly across the sky from east to west, directly over our position, in pure silence.   This is absolutely mystifying and unexplainable and was around 8 times as fast as the previous airplane.   We cannot decipher what shape--it was simply too fast.  Though we can say that it was without a doubt far beyond anything capable to apparent human technologies.;41.3184774661515;-81.8327353965183
