It looks like a bright star in the sky but has bright lines coming down from it.  Moves in the sky darting in different directions but within a 2 hour period it disappears.  We have seen this quite frequently this summer (probably about 5 days out of seven).  It has just recently changed in appearance from just darting, to having streaming lights coming down from it.  On 3 occasions, the sky below it vibrates a light that looks like a white flasher.  It flashes like a police car light and is in the area below it.  Sometimes it is all white and at other times viewing it with or without binoculars it has red, blue and green coming from it.  If you look at it from another area, you would think it was just a star.  I think our location with the trees makes it visible to see how much it moves in the sky.  Would welcome someone to come look at it.  It's out there frequently ev! en when there are clouds and no other stars in the sky.;41.3184774661515;-81.8327353965183
