Bright moving light in the sky;2020-04-16 21:30:00;1 hour;Bright moving light in the sky A bright light was seen in the sky, brighter than stars around it.  The light itself was lower in the sky than the stars, but higher than airplanes flying.  It hovered in place, but would move around back and forth, up and down.  My parents also saw it, they looked through binoculars at it, which they saw it take on a snake form and dart around in the sky and then it would stop again and the snake form would go away back to just the light.  The light would scan the sky, back and forth. There was also a hazy mist around the object, which wasn’t seen around the stars or planes flying.  After about an hour, the light looked as if it turned around and flew away. It got dimmer and dimmer, until it wasn’t visible anymore.;41.3184774661515;-81.8327353965183
