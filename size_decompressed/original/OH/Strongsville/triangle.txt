I was about14 years old and was standing with a friend (I don't remember who), near the street by my home. It was cool but not cold, and the air and sky were crystal clear.There was little light pollution as there were hardly any street lights and little to no noise to speak of. We were just hanging out and talking when I looked up and saw three lights in a triangle shape moving quietly across the sky against a starry night sky.  It was about the same height as jets fly and I told my friend to look up and they also saw it. All I could see were the lights and they were slowly spining in a circle while moving across the sky at about the same speed as a jet would fly. Stars would dissapear as this craft would pass between me and the stars and then reappear. I was too young to pay too close attention,so I am not sure of the size, but I was aware that this was something out of the ordinary and mentioned to my friend that it was a ufo. We watched it it till it moved out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.3184774661515;-81.8327353965183
