Pulsating orb flies silent over residential area, captured on video.;2017-06-17 21:45:00;8 minutes;Pulsating orb flies silent over residential area, captured on video. 9:45 pm I was standing in my driveway talking to my neighbor.  I looked to my left and saw an amazingly bright orb, or small disc shaped object approx. less than 100 ft. away from me. object was flying at a very low rate of speed directly over top of my garage on a N by NE course.  The object was pulsating deep orange/yellow light.  Object was completely silent.  The light was like nothing I have ever seen before.   I targeted the object with a 5 mile visibility green laser, which had no effect.  Object continued on N by NE path until it faded out.  It also seemed to be ascending slowly.  Another witness snapped 2 photos and took a short video with a cellphone.;40.8124;-82.9675000000001
