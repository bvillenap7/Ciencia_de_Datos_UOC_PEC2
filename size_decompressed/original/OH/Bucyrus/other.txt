Each object appeared to be an elongated return module. In the mid-70's, I couldn't find a fishing buddy, so I went alone.  I trudged 1500 feet to the spot I chose got my bait in the water, put my bell on my pole and leaned against the bank and looked up at the full-moon.  And was I shocked!  Facing to the west as I looked up I noticed an object near the moon.  This object was well lit, as the moon, not hard to see plainly-noticing first was a ring around the object.   Secondly, I noticed the object seemed to be an adapted return module.  It appeared as though the heat shield and the nose cone had been separated and more body was added.  It appeared as the body was attached to the heat shield and tapered down to the nose cone section.  Nose cone section had been adapted to round from squarish as the return module has been.  The object zipped around the moon.   As it started it's circum-navigation of the moon, a second object was revealed that was same as the first, one having went around the moon once and one twice.
