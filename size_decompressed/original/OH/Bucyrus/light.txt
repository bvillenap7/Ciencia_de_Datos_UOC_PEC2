Bright star like light at 8:40 am in clear sky moving from southeast to northwest then disappeared;2012-02-06 08:40:00;approx. 15 sec;Bright star like light at 8:40 am in clear sky moving from southeast to northwest then disappeared I was driving north east on Ohio Route 4, approximately 6 miles southwest of Bucyrus in Crawford County, Ohio at 8:40 A.M., Monday, February 6, 2012.  The sky was clear with no clouds.  State Route 4 has a polar coordinate of approximately 55 degrees (or 35 degrees east of north). At approximately 40 degrees, (range unknown)I saw what I first thought was a planet, (not unlike Venus), bright star like light.  However, I saw it move to the northwest, then turn or bank upward, possibly with a then curved crescent edge like wing silhoute that was visible for maybe one second.   The light then continued to norhtwest for a few more seconds like 2 or 3) and then totally disappeared at about 55 degrees.  Although this may have been an aircraft marking light that was no longer turned in my direction when the plane banked away, I saw no darker shadow or evidence of a plane flying away.  The light totally disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.8124;-82.9675000000001
