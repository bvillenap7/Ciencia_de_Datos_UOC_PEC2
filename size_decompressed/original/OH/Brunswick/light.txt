Teal Green & Red Lights over the clouds in Brunswick Ohio;2012-10-30 12:00:00;30 minutes;Teal Green & Red Lights over the clouds in Brunswick Ohio I'm a 19 year old male from North Ohio, I was sitting on the couch socializing with my family, the TV  was on when i saw a very odd green color on my backyard deck.   At first i thought it was my TV, gaining some sense i walked to the door covered by curtain to see what was making the strange color.  When i looked up i was speechless all i could blurt out was MY GOD.  The entire sky was a teal color in three seconds it turned green, then to a red color.  But there were no objects flying,  It felt like it was engulfing my backyard.   I've never seen anything like this in my life, neither have my mother and my brother.  I just want Closure.

The ball was orange like fire and heading east and climbing as it approached.it made no sound and emitted no contrails as it was flying.I called my girl friend outside to witness what I was observing.  The object was moving rapidly,and as it approached the clouds to the east it didn't disappear in them.  We lost sight of the object as it headed east, the light still as bright and brilliant as when I first saw it approaching.;41.2463;-81.8310000000001
