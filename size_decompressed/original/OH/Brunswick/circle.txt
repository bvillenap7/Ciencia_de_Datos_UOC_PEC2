It started with only 3 circles in a straight line following after one another and then they would start to dissapear starting with the one leading the line. They would then reappear almost like a looping formation only this time there was four circles and then when they dissapeared again and reappeared there was 5 and then there was 6. They did one final loop and then dissaperaed all together. There was no flashing lights they were just white circles moving very fast in a straight line upwards into the sky and then would dissapear and then reappear in the exact spot they first started in.;41.2463;-81.8310000000001
