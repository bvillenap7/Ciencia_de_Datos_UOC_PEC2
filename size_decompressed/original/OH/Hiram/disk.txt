2 whitish saucers seen in hiram ohio;2013-06-15 15:15:00;2 minutes;2 whitish saucers seen in hiram ohio i was the passenger in my car, my son was driving, along route 82 east bound, going home from the store.   we were at the top of a big hill (this area is the second highest area in the state of ohio).  i live in the flight path between vienna airforce base and ravenna arsenal and see military aircraft on a daily baises.  as we were at the top of the hill, with a vast parnoramic view. i saw 2 craft about 1 to 2 miles ahead at the 1 to 2 o'clock position and thought they were the very familar c130's, but then i realized that they were not planes. they were about 1000 feet from the ground heading north north east. they were saucer shape, the top having more of an arch than the bottom.  The color was odd.  It was not silver or white but more of a mother of pearl color, may be even a 'snow' color.   When i pointed them out to my son and as he started looking for them, we were going down hill and in to the trees.  i lost sight of them.  we drove around the farm fields for a while looking for them, but they were not seen again.  They were 1 and 1'2 times as wide as my finger tip at arms lenght  and about a quarter of the heigth. and had that odd color to them.  Both appeared to be identical.  The one on the right a little higher in altitude;41.3312;-81.1483
