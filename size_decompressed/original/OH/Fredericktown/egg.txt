I was driving north and the two objects were observed ahead of me in the NNW sky.  I watched them in the sky for about ten minutes.   The objects slowly moved closer and ended up on the NNE sky.  Finally, when they were directly east of me, the lead object swooped down beyond the horizon.  The 2nd rose and then swooped as well.  Each object was the size of a full moon when high in the sky.  Two white lights alternately dimmed on each object  It looked like a car with its brights on, only set in the sky.;40.4995;-82.5866
