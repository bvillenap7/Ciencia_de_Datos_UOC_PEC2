((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax.  See below.  PD))  Bright red light that disappeared quickly.;2005-07-09 21:00:00;5 minutes;Bright red light that disappeared quickly. I looked into the southwestern sky and saw a bright red object. It was in the distance and was larger than a star. The object did nopt appear to move. After five minutes, the object disappeared briefly. I then noticed it quickly moving to the west and had the appearance of falling out of the sky. The movement was very rapid. ((NUFORC Note:  We, at first, believed that the reports of a red light over the Brook Park, OH, area, might, in fact, be a possible hoax.  A number of suspected hoaxed telephoned reports from Brook Park, OH, placed by young teenagers, on next day, included profanity and less than serious comments.  However, we are reconsidering our position, given that a television station in the area of the sightings, as well as the local police, received a number of telephone calls, and written reports, about the event.   This witness reported over the telephone that the object ascended he reports above that it descended.  PD));41.3957;-81.8157000000001

Reddish star looking object moving across sky, stopped overhead, changed directions and until it disappeared.;2005-07-10 21:45:00;4 minutes;Reddish star looking object moving across sky, stopped overhead, changed directions and until it disappeared. I was lying on my back staring at the sky, awaiting the local fireworks show. I observed what appeared to be a bright star or planet in the sky.  It had a reddish hue and was about 45 degrees from the southern horizon.   It caught my eye because it appeared to be moving, very slowly, almost imperceptible at first.  The object was moving in a northerly direction until it was almost straight above me.   It stopped for a few seconds and began moving again in a different direction, heading east until it was out of sight.   Again, it appeared to be a bright star only it was moving.  My wife and friend said it must be a plane. No way.  Although the object moved at about the same speed as a plane flying very high would, it stopped and changed directions.  Also, there were no blinking lights or red/white colors you typically would see in a plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Sat motionless & silent for 10 mins. as another aircraft entered horizon in it's direction it moved at a leasure pace keeping same altitude at an angle to passenger craft until no longer could be seen.

Slowly moving lights that stopped, hovered, then went out.  Near large electric towers and power lines.;2009-06-21 22:30:00;30 minutes;Slowly moving lights that stopped, hovered, then went out.  Near large electric towers and power lines. 2 UFO's sighted around 10:30 PM EDT, a second sighting of one object at around 10:45 PM EDT , June 21, 2009. The 1st 2 appeared in the south with slow movement to the north.  They then moved slowly to the southwest about 10 degrees and stopped, hovering just above the trees.  At this point it got serious as the previous thought of a helicopter formation which I have seen here before wasn't working. and there was no sound at all. I can hear the helicopters coming before I see them usually. They then just blinked out like someone sliding a dimmer switch to off.  That was the No Way is this happening moment. They were about 24 degrees above the horizon. Very bright yellowish color.  Appeared to be the same brightness as a streetlight at 600 feet away.  These were seen a moment before me by the neighbors(4 people) out on their pool deck about 6 feet higher up than me. The second sighting was only me, as everyone had gone in for the evening, was south moving southwest again at about 20 degrees. They just seem to suddenly appear. I was able to see this object in the 8 x 50 finder scope. Bright bluish or greenish diamond shaped mesh pattern lights 3 or 4 surrounding an intense bright center light source.  The object diameter appeared to be the same size as a full moon in the finder. Lost it in the trees.  They don't seem to be very big, maybe about 16-20 feet in size.  Couldn't determine any particular shape. I kept trying to get it in the view of main scope, moving to fast for that. During the event I was setting up the LX telescope in the back yard and had to off/on the system 3-4 times and re-enter the keypad info as the Go-To function would not go to the right part of the sky, it was off 10 degrees or so. Even with the Hi precision turned on it was off a few degrees. All Ok after they left. This occurred about 30 minutes before we saw the objects. But they could have been there behind the trees and power lines going to the towers run by my back yard about 250 feet away. Not sure yet what was going on with that but suspect a connection. Both sightings appeared to be over 2 high voltage electrical  twin towers about 700 feet away. More likely the feeder wires that come off of these towers a head toward the west. The electric towers are about 125 feet high. Looks like these objects were about 600 to 800 feet away from me.   The appeared to be hovering at about 200-300 feet above the towers and wires.

The second sighting was only me, as everyone had gone in for the evening, was south moving southwest again at about 20 degrees. They just seem to suddenly appear. (after thinking about it they seemed to suddenly appear right over the towers when 1st seen) I was able to see this object in the 8x50 finder scope. Later realized that in the excitement I forgot the finder scope view is upside down. Drawing below is right side up.

4 lights, moving across the night sky, changing directions and speeds.;2010-05-22 22:30:00;15 minutes;4 lights, moving across the night sky, changing directions and speeds. A group of us walked outside and saw a group of 3 lights moving across the sky.  At first we thought they were helicopters, but we quickly noticed that they were too high up to be helicopters.  The lights were a bright orange/red and were moving in irregular patterns from a south to north direction.  One of them stopped.  Another one sped up past it, and then slightly changed direction. The last one continued its speed and eventually all the lights “went out” starting with the one that stopped.   After the lights went out we were all trying to figure out what we just witnessed.  We live 5 minutes away from Hopkins airport, these were not planes.  Not helicopters.  There was no starboard or starlight, the lights were not blinking it was solid.  This was nothing any of us have ever seen. The thought of it being an asteroid was brought up, but there was no trail left behind in the sky, and they were changing directions and speeds.   An older couple pulled over to the side of the street and confirmed that they have “never seen anything remotely close to these lights in over 60 years of living in Cleveland, OH.”  The actual amount of time we witnessed the lights was not longer then 3 minutes.   About 10 minutes later we saw another light, a single one moving slower then the previous.  It started to change direction and head east.  Within a minute of watching, the light “went out.” I could still see the shape of it through the clouds.  It appeared to be large, dark, and round.  I tried to follow it for as long as I could but when I blinked it was gone.   We called into FOX8 News to see if they knew what it was, and they told us that they were following it from Lakewood, OH and that they didn’t know what it was.  I have no doubt in my mind that what I witnessed was beyond anything I have ever seen.;41.3957;-81.8157000000001
