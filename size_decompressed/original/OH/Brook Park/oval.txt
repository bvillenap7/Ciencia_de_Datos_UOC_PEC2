BRIGHT RED BALL OF LIGHT IN THE SKY MOVING SLOWLY;2005-07-10 23:40:00;15;BRIGHT RED BALL OF LIGHT IN THE SKY MOVING SLOWLY WATCHED A BRIGHT RED OBJECT MOVE SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY AND STOP AT THE EDGE OF THE AIRPORT. THE OBJECT STAYED AT A STANDSTILL FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES, MADE A SHARP TURN STOPPED AND STOOD STILL FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES MADE ANOTHER SHARP TURN STARTED BLINKING AND SPED OFF AND AS WE WATCHED IT, IT VANISHED RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES. ((NUFORC Note:  We, at first, believed that the reports of a red light over the Brook Park, OH, area, might, in fact, be a possible hoax.  A number of suspected hoaxed telephoned reports from Brook Park, OH, placed by young teenagers, on next day, included profanity and less than serious comments.  However, we are reconsidering our position, given that a television station in the area of the sightings, as well as the local police, received a number of telephone calls, and written reports, about the event.  Some reports are for July 9 others for July 10.  We are attempting to confirm the accurate date of the event.  PD));41.3957;-81.8157000000001
