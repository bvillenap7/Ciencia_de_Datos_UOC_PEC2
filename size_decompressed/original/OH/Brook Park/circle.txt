During this time I noticed a bright light coming toward us from the south and mentioned it to my wife saying to her boy that would be a neat sight to see fireworks from an airplane on this clear night. As it approached closer I noticed that it was much higher than I thought and thought this was a little strange, since we are close to airport you would see many planes run parallel to airport in the approach or  pattern for landing .But this was much higher and since I have no reference to size I am unsure of height a guess would be 30,000 -40,000 if it was airplane size. As light approached it had slowed and was about 80 degrees from horizon or almost directly above us. It stopped, drifted to right for about 5 minutes then disappeared. 2 minutes later another one appeared followed the same route but hovered above and drifted to right and left and stayed there for at least 15 minutes, but then lost this when fireworks started at around 10:00  or 10:10 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

My sister and I were in our back yard looking at the stars and one object caught our attention.  It was bright red and seemed stationary.  I actually thought it was Mars at first and so did she but it was too big to be so and as we soon found out it moved too fast as well.  I should note that three of us saw the object at first but my other sister went inside so she did not actually witness it move away as it eventually did, to our surprise, at about 11:40 PM.  When we first noticed it, which didn't take long, it was positioned about NNW.  I estimate at about 25-30 degrees in the sky, 90 degrees being looking straight up into the sky between the East and West horizons.  It moved up into the sky seemingly orbiting at first.  Like I have stated it came off as Mars at first but too big.  We were alarmed to actually see it move before our very eyes, again too fast for a planet or a space station which NASA proclaimed.  Maybe a sattelite but no because sattelites don't move up in the night sky and all of a sudden change directions within a 20 minute period of time seeming to change its mind or course.  Well again it moved up to about a 40 degree angle if you were to say east to west was 180 degrees- 90 being looking directly up in the sky.  Now here is what gets strange My sister took a flashlight that she had and turned it on and off.  At once, as if it was responding, started to blink and moved more noticeably faster but back towards the West moving slightly south as it did so and vanished over the horizon. I did not notice any dancing around, I would just like to add that Cleveland Hopkins International Airport is just a couple of miles away also to our NNW. Coincidence? This is no hoax!  Sorry if this description was too long.;41.3957;-81.8157000000001
