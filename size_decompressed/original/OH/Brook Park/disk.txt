I was a kid, maybe 7 or 8 driving in backseat with my grandma, my brother and grandfather in fro t seats. It was summer and maybe 7 or 8pm. My grandma and me saw the object at the same time and were both very sure of what it was. A silver disc shaped ufo with multi colored lights around the disc. It was hovering very low and seemed to be following our car. My brother and grandpa did not see it, that I can remember. Sorry to report so many years later, didnt know this was something I could do.;41.3957;-81.8157000000001
