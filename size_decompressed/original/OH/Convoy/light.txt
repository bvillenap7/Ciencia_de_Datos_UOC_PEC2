It was above the road, then up in the air hovering  Made no sound. Vanished! My mother who was a sec. at school and myself a high school student. Mom was driving the car. I saw in my side mirror a bright light came out of nowhere,it came up on us suddenly. I ask Mom if she seen it. She said yes but it isn’t on the road it isn’t a car. When Mom speed up it would speed up when we slowed down it slowed down. She said keep your eye on it. It disappeared,  then it was beside our car up in the air about 50 ft. It Followed along beside us. We turned into a lane and turned off the car. It hovered above. Mom got out to see if it made any sound. No sound.  It was such a bright light we couldn’t make out the shape. But the light looked round. I wanted to blow our horn so someone at the houses would look out and see it. Then it just vanished. We told a few people but no one believed us. All that week our local radio WOWO out of Fort Wayne Indiana had some UFO sites by people in the area. I was scared and was shaken! I will never forget that nigh! t.       no one else on this country road but a few houses.;40.925;-84.7192
