Shiny silver sphere, no lights, propellers, or smoke seen;2013-05-25 14:00:00;60 seconds;shiny silver sphere, no lights, propellers, or smoke seen I was in car, stopping at mail box, when I saw a shiney object in the clear sky. At first, my first impression was that it was a miler balloon.  I got a better look, and realized it was way too big and too far away for it to be a balloon. i grabbed my phone to get a picture, and it left towards the west very fast.  I pulled into our driveway, and tried to spot it again, but it was gone. It was a clear, cloudless bright day.  The sphere shaped object did not appear to have any lights on it. None that I could make out.  No propellers were seen, or smoke.  Just, a sphere shaped object that was still for a short time.  When it took off, there was no smoke trail seen. It disappeared very quicky.;40.925;-84.7192
