I followed it from that check point til i came to one of the other check point ill call it check point 56. I stood outside the truck looking up to get a better look it went directly over me it was triangle in shape with the pointed ends wedged ( they were not pointed ) they had a white light at the wedged ends. there was no sound when it went over me, i seen what looked like a matalic triangle center or it was hollow i couldnt really tell all i know there was stars or a reflection of stars on the bottom that is why i said matalic there was also several lights along the bottom of the craft. then it excellerated that is when it made a noise like engines, and tilted to the side as it as it started moving away from me. I noticed several of what looked like windows in one of these windows was somthing that looked like a small being. I went back to my partner i had that night to see if he seen anything he said he didn't i also checked with the airport in the area they said there was nothing on the monitor bet i could make a report i felt very dumb and i was too afraid to make a repot at the time. a few days later i was dianoced with uveitias in my eyes wich made them both very light sensative there was no explination as to why my eyes became light sensative all i can think of was the sighting i don't know if there was a connection or not.it has bothered me ever since for some reason i can't get it out of my mind.
