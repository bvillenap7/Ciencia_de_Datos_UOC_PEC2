I rushed inside to grab my step dad which he seen them to and it continued for about 45 mins and I would say we seen almost 200 or more.  People say its space x but with as fast as some wanted to go than others and how many at one time satelites has to rule out.  Also some were very low to the ground than others and some stayed in the sky blending with the stars and I tryd, but couldn't get them on camera it was just straight black.;41.6689;-84.5433
