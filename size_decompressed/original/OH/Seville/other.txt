It did not look to be very high in the air. I  first thought I was seeing things, then I looked up again and there it was as clear as can be.  I did not stop the vehicle or take photos out of fear. I was heading from Pittsburgh to Mansfield OH.  I was wondering if other citings have been reported in this area on the same date.;41.0209;-81.8526
