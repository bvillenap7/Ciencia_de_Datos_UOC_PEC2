Green fireball in W sky, leaving trail and then exploding.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object may have been a meteor.  PD));2007-03-11 20:00:00;5 seconds;Green fireball in Western sky leaving trail and then exploding I caught a green mass out of the corner of my eye in the Western sky moving at a very fast rate of speed.  I walked around the corner of the house to look at the West sky.  At that time, I saw the green light getting brighter and just then, a green flaming mass appeared traveling South to North.  The mass had a tail following it and I watched it travel for approximately 5 seconds.  At that time, it exploded, much like a firework.  As it exploded, debris extended in all directions.  At that time, the entire light disappeared.  The stream of light was the entire Western sky, as far as I could see from South to North.  It looked to be about as high as a jumbo jet airliner would fly but much larger, perhaps 6 jumbo jets put together in size.  The light was more of a light fluorescent green.  I have witnessed many shooting stars and this was unlike anything I have ever seen.  The green color was very vivid and sharp.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object may have been a meteor.
