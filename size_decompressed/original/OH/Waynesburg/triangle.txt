Amber triangular craft seen in Northeast Ohio;2008-01-28 20:15:00;approx. 20:15 thru 20:30;Amber triangular craft seen in Northeast Ohio  500 Lights On Object0: Yes My mother and I were driving south-bound headed into Waynesburg, Ohio at about 8:15 PM, or 20:15, when I noticed something odd above the treeline on the large hill to the southeast. It was a triangle shaped craft with 3 lights. A 4th light was off to the left of the triangle. All of the lights were an Amber or Orange that were very bright. The 3 lights on the triangle were around 20 or 30 feet apart and the light off to the side was around 50 to 70 feet away. They were hovering, not moving, and made no sound from what I could hear. We went into a store for around 5 minutes and when we returned, the craft was gone. As we turned onto the next road and headed east. As I tooked into the sky to find it again, a small light caught my eye. The sky was extremely clear, not a star or cloud out. It was dark, however, and very black. The light that was off to the side of the original triangle was following us down the road but at a safe distance. The object was high in the sky in front of the car and was still the Amber or Orange color.;40.6854;-81.2698
