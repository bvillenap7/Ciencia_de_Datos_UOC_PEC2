UFO sighting of boomerang in Ohio during Daylight.;2001-05-28 18:45:00;1 minute;UFO sighting of boomerang in Ohio during Daylight. uploaded to youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNPYq8YHgnc  I was testing my camcorder. I wanted to see how well it could zoom in on a high flying jet. I set out a lawn chair, and watched the sky until I could find a plane. The moon was out, and I was looking at it.. to the right of the moon I saw an object that was about to pass in front of it. That's where I began filming. The object was so small and high up, I had a hard time zooming in on it in focus. If it wasn't for the moon, I would have hard even a harder time, because it helped the camera focus. The center of the video was cut out by the Cleveland Ufology Project (Who I gave the video to).. which contained several minutes of me zooming in and out trying to find the object. The Cleveland Ufology project gave the video to Dr. Bruce Maccabee.. a leading Ufologist. Who told me after viewing the video..  The object appears to change shape, like a string of balloons, but I know it's not that, I don't know what it is. Before I handed over the video to the Cleveland Ufology Project..  I handed it over to the news.. Cleveland Fox 8.  They said it was an optical allusion of a jet.. I find that impossible because of the maneuvers it makes, such as at the beginning.. its flying sideways, and in reverse while facing forward.  Then it turns facing down towards earth all while appearing not to drop in altitude or slow down..  it turns until it faces forward with its direction of flight, but always stays moving the same direction.;40.6854;-81.2698
