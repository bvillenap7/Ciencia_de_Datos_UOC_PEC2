Loud stationary noise and lights.;2013-10-31 21:03:00;10-15 seconds;Loud stationary noise and lights On October 31st, 2013 at approximately 21:03 hours, my wife and I were standing on the rear porch watching the weather.  It has been windy and overcast for the last two hours and the rain from earlier had stopped.  We were both facing to the north to keep the chilling winds at our backs.  Suddenly a loud noise came from the sky to the east-northeast.Along With the noise was steady flashes of bright white lights reflecting off the low, fast moving clouds. It was a loud noise and sounded like two distinct but simutainious notes. The lights and sound did not move...  The noise sounded like two simultaneous steady tones... If I had to guess what the tones sounded like, I would say a pair of jet turbines but very clean... meaning no low rumble of exhaust sounds, as a jet makes when flying.  Again, the lights and sound stayed in one area only.  The noise and lights stopped after about 10 seconds.  The event stopped as fast and as loud as it started the only difference is! that the tones dropped quickly in pitch. This was completely strange because that kind of noise with lights did not belong in the sky.  In fact, I've never heard anything like it before.  After the event, my wife and I just looked at each other. I ask her, DID YOU JUST HEAR THAT?  She said, Yeah..  I then asked her if she saw the flashes of light too.  Again, she replied, Yeah!;39.9857;-84.5281
