10-12 hoovering balls of light;2010-09-05 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;10-12 hoovering balls of light At 10:00pm in the Eastern sky 10-12 orange balls of light in a formation of 2X2X2X2 one on top of the other with space in between.  Did not appear to be one object but multiples.  Reminded me briefly of trails left by fireworks but they stood still in the sky and just faded away 1 and 2 at a time.   From the time we noticed them we observed them for roughly a minute or more. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
