Saw large object after power went out in area.;2016-06-24 22:00:00;8 minutes;Saw large object after power went out in area. After a power outage, I went in the back of our house to see if other homes were affected. We have a large field with power lines.  Immedialty after the power went out, I saw a large blimp like object hovering a little near the top of the power lines, moving slowly, and making no sounds.  The front of the object had a light, the back end appeared to be dark.    It slowly moved down the path of the power line.  I followed it for about 5 min.   I went in my house to get my husband, when we went back out it was gone and the power came back on.;41.4763;-81.3342
