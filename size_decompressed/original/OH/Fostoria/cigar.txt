I saw this type and color in 1967;2002-05-09 02:00:00;2-3 seconds;I saw this type and color in 1967 I was setting at my computer out on the sun porch, the computer is situated so my back is to the surrounding glass of the enclosure and when I look up I can see through the picture window and see what my cat's are in to. It was 2am in the morning and I heard a low hum, I thought maybe my computer was acting up so I straightend up to concentrate on the noise, it got a little louder and I saw an orange object in the reflection of the picture window headed due east toward Fostoria, I recently moved here and I'm between Fostoria and Bloomdale, it only lasted a couple of seconds and was gone.;41.1625000000002;-83.4156000000002
