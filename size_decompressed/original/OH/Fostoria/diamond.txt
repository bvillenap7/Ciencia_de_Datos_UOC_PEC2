When my wife and I was going east on us route 613 we saw 3 diamond shaped objects in the sky. We stopped moving and then the objects stopped moving. We sat there watching them for at least twenty minutes. In the rear of the diamond objects were three lights on each of the three damond objects. The moon was full so you can check the date of the siting by astronautical charting for moon positioning. They stayed perfectly still.  Then all of the sudden they took off all in the same direction.  We didnt have a camera at the time. But oddly a week later someone in tiffin ohio stated that they had seen the same thing .;41.1625000000002;-83.4156000000002
