However, as we continued to watch, it moved much slower than a falling star.  It appeared as a ball of white light flashing with a tail of white flashes behind it (this was as it was coming down).  It then leveled off and continued flying to the north.  We then lost sight of it, due to the trees in the distance blocking our further view.  I have never witnessed anything like this before.;41.1625000000002;-83.4156000000002
