Orange-red lights in formation and moving silently across the sky.;2012-09-08 19:48:00;10 minutes;Orange-red lights in formation and moving silently across the sky. I was walking through the living room and noticed odd lights in the sky.  I called for my Mother and her companion to come outside, which they did.  We stood in confusion and awe as we watched red-orange lights in the sky.  I would describe them as ‘lantern like’ and medium-slow moving.  They were silent and in a formation following one another closely.  There was one that lagged behind the others.  We were watching for them to come on the other side of a tree line, but, they didn’t.  They seemingly, disappeared.  The event lasted about ten minutes and the objects were low flying. My neighbor down the street also saw them. I am a professional in project management with a Master’s degree.  My Mother is a homemaker and her companion is a retired blue-collar worker.;39.9071999999999;-82.7553000000003
