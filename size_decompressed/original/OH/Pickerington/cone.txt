It was a hot day and i was mowing my yard without a shirt on.  I bent over to pick up a toy and felt an old back pain coming on, so i strighted right up. Then something hit me in the right chest.  It felt like a bug bite.  When i looked at it,it was something that looked like the tip of an ink pin.  Silver and very small just like the tip of a pin. When i went to reach for it, about half way there with my left hand, it was just gone.  Didn't see it fall or fly backwards, it was just not there.   It left a very small red mark on me, but no blood.  It made no sound.  I told my wife about it at the time, but no one else.  I did look for it in the grass where i was standing, but didn't find it.  Could it be flying that fast and stop almost on a dime and fly away in a blink of the eye?  PLus be so small?  Has anybody ever hear about something like this?;39.9071999999999;-82.7553000000003
