Possibly over Baltimore or Buckeye Lake area. For the past two evenings I have observed an object due east of Pickerington, Ohio in the sky.  With binoculars I can tell its very lit up, saucer in shape.  This evening I observed a blinking object which seems to be observing.  The blinking object approached from left, flew underneath saucer then to right.  I saw an object very similar to this UFO back in 1974 off of Gender Road, south of Reynoldsburg.  It seems to have red, green and white lights.  The underneath is very lit up with white lights.  I have no ability to take photo.  Too far for phone to capture.  Just within last ten minutes, it has raised up higher but again now it’s stationary, just hovering.  No noise can be heard but I’m probably miles away from object.  Round saucer shape with raised small dome like structure on top.  It’s possibly over Baltimore or Buckeye Lake area.  One more thing that might be important.  We see helicopters on maneuvers from Rickenbacker Air Base quite often in sim! ilar location but nearer to us and closer to ground.  They of course do not remain stationary and they fly from south to north/northwest and disappear from view within five to ten minutes.  So far this evening, this object has been observed for over two hours.  It’s presently 10 P.M.;39.9071999999999;-82.7553000000003
