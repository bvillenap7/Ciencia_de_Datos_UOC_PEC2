Triangle shaped object with huge lights spotted going down into a corn field.;2013-09-01 23:00:00;3 minutes;Triangle shaped object with huge lights spotted going down into a corn field. My friends and I were having a bonfire this past night.  The area we were in was a country land with a lot of corn fields, trees and open fields around.  We were sitting talking and then one of my friends noticed an object in the sky.  At first it seemed as though it was a helicopter, although it had a huge light attached to the front of the aircraft.  As the object came closer to us it did not look like a helicopter anymore, we noticed the object was flat and as it passed over us we saw it was a flat triangle shape.  By the way, the object was very close to the ground.  We saw one big light on the front of the craft and other white and red lights flashing on it.  As it started moving away from us it went over a tree line and looked like it just went down. This excited our group so we decided to go looking for it because it seemed like it went down in a corn field, as we were driving on back roads we saw a bright light coming from the corn field, there wasn't any houses at the spot we spotted the light, although it was too deep into the corn field so we couldn't investigate any longer. No one that was at the bonfire tonight knew what we had just saw. It was too low for and airplane, and too flat to be a helicopter.  We have no explanation as to what we saw. I hope this report helps, thanks for your time;39.9071999999999;-82.7553000000003
