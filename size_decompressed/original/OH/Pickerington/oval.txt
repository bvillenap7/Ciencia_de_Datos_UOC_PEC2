Numerous orange globes seen moving east to west over Pickerington, Ohio.;2017-10-21 22:05:00;35 minutes;Numerous orange globes seen moving east to west over Pickerington, Ohio. First noticed 4 or 5 orange globes flying fairly low about 22:00.  They were followed by a cluster of approximately 16-18 orange globes, then tapered off to single globes spaced one after the other.  All were heading East from West.  Some glowed, others were solid in their orange color.  None had flashing red, green or white lights as is typical on aircraft.  Continued for approximately 35 minutes. I did not notice any sound at all. I was driving home from my office.  I'm a mental health counselor.  The skies are somewhat cloudy, though a few stars can be seen.  Visible stars were considerably smaller than these globes, a different color and all together different in appearance by comparison. Temperature is 62 degrees.;39.9071999999999;-82.7553000000003
