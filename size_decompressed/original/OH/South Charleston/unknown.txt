Bright Flashes of Light;2010-03-12 00:00:00;10 mins;Bright Flashes of Light Driving to Cedarville in the early evening a series of bright flashes, which lit up the whole sky for an indeterminate period of time made me think a severe thunderstorm was about to strike, so I turned around and drove back home!   Got to my place and waited but no rain ever came!   I had seen this before in New Mexico about twenty years ago!    Didn't hear or see any craft, and no thunder or lightning either, which at the time I thought was strange!   Noticed another report similar to mine entered for February on this site and decided to add mine on the chance that someone else in this general area saw it too!;39.8612;-83.6688000000001
