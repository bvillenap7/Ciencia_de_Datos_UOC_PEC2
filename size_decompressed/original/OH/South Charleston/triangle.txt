Triangle with brilliant lighs all over it!;2007-08-14 23:30:00;30secs to 1min;Triangle with brilliant lighs all over it! Sitting outside enjoying the late night coolness and mild wind conditionsi in the side yard amidst a grove of trees.  Looked to center of sky from my vantage point facing due West, and saw a brilliantly lit triangular shaped craft with flashing lights, making no sound whatsoever on a NW heading.  Only visible for a short duration.  Craft at 45 degree angle to my line of sight.  No clouds, low wind, good visibility except for leaves, branches, and trees around area.  Craft disappeared behind leaves, branches and was lost to sight.  Got up and moved to get a clearer view, but it was as if it became invisible or diapeared.  I have seen other phenomena in this area several times in the past few years, but didn't report them!  Location near Air National Guard base and not to far from WPAFB either. Time is approximate as pocket watch stopped and had to guestimate the time!  Reset watch several times and it started up again and is working today!  It is a battery operated watch.;39.8612;-83.6688000000001
