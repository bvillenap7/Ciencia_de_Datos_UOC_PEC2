I was driving back from Archbold Ohio coming back on  OH-2/191 on my way through Stryker Ohio. It was a clear crisp day, blue skies. Right before I hit Stryker Ohio, I noticed a disc like object very high in the sky. I'm not a good estimator of distance, but I would say a good 2 miles from me.  It was clearly not moving in any particular direction and actually seemed to be keeping stationary. I noticed a plane directly above with (entrails) on it somewhat near the object. But this object was not a plane. I would say definitely silver in color, but it was pretty distant so I'm not 100% on the color description. Anyway, I would definitely describe it as just floating up there. I kept a direct eye on it so I didn't lose sight of it as I kept driving. But in a virtual instant the object was gone right before I hit the little town of Stryker. It's like it blipped out of the atmosphere. I flabergassed because it was such a clear day and it would have taken something with extradorinary speed to just, well vanish. It was sincerly, one moment it was there, then gone. Just a footnote, at teh time I had the visual of the object, in my head (sarcastically) I was talking to the object, saying I see you, I really do see you.  10 seconds later it was gone. At the time I really didn't know what I was looking at, I was wondering as I got closer maybe it would be something like a plane or helicopter. But when it disappeared, I knew it was something more than a plane or helicopter. I'm not here to waste people's time, I know what I saw, and I'm telling you it was very real to me. I just don't have a clue what it could have been though.;41.4861;-84.4089
