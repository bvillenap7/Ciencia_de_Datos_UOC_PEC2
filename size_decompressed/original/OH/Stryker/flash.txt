Just then I noticed a brief flash of light in the area of (after checking the star charts) the constelation Cephius. The first flash lasted about as long as what the strobe lights on an aircraft do, but then didn't continue to flash, but I kept watching. About 20-25 seconds later another flash that seemed to be fainter and slightly to the NE of where it flashed previously, and again a long pause of 20-25 sec and another fainter flash even fainter as if it were leaving the Earths atmosphere. The initial flash had 2 lights very close together, but after the 3rd flash I couldn't determine there to be seperate lights. I saw a total of 4 flashes and by the time of the 4th, it was just a barely noticeable dot and had I not known where to be looking would have never noticed it.

Absent that possibility, we do not know what was observed.  PD));41.4861;-84.4089
