It traveled from East to West diredtly over head at about 75 degrees from straight up. I was at the back edge of my house and could only track it about 90 degrees in the sky, but it covered this distance in about 4-5 seconds. An F-16 at about 1500 ft could do this but I heard nothing and it was no plane. It was dimly lit,and seemed to be lit more in a triangular shape, I/E at the corners, and covered the area, that to the first nuckle of your thumb would cover. It was over very quickly and I was left there thinking, what in the hell was that?;41.4861;-84.4089
