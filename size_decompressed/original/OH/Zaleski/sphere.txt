Orange sphere slowly drops for the Zaleski, Ohio sky.;2003-03-10 19:45:00;3 seconds;Orange sphere slowly drops for the Zaleski, Ohio sky. I just chanced to look at a particular part of the sky just in time to catch a look at this object.  It was perfectly round and unusually large for a meteor I thought.  It had no tail what-so-ever and was orange in color with dark spots in it.  It fell slower than a meteor would I thought.  I stood waiting for a boom, but heard no sound. That's my story, and I'm stickin' to it.;39.2844;-82.3986
