Triangle craft flew over my backyard;2007-07-26 22:30:00;30-45 seconds;Triangle craft flew over my backyard It was late at night and my cousin and I were out in my back yard observing the moon through my telescope. I seen a very bright light coming twords us from the south and when I turned and looked I couldn't believe what i seen. There was a craft very low (Probably could have hit it with a baseball If I had one at the time). It was kind of a triangle shape and had 3 very bright white lights on the bottom of it one in each corner of the craft that was it there were no blinking lights of color and the craft did not make a noise what so ever. You could see the bottom of the craft and it was black with a weird design on it. It was totally light up form the 3 white lights. It flew directly over us and in a matter of seconds was completely out of sight. I have no idea where it came from or what it was.
