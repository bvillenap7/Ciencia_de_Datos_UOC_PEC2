String of 32 satellite-like lights that lasted 10 minutes.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-05 20:30:00;10 minutes;String of 32 satellite-like lights that lasted 10 minutes Around 8:30 on Thursday evening (3/5/20), I was outside on my patio looking at the western sky.  There were a number of stars shining bright.  Then I saw one of them moving in a northeasterly direction.  I assumed it to be an orbiting satellite. No sound, just a small light like a star.  No flashing lights or colors. Then a saw another one following right behind it.  I thought it a bit odd that two satellites would be on the same path and following so closely together.  After I saw 5 or 6 of these lights, I thought maybe the military was on some kind of maneuver, but if they were planes they would have had to have been way up there.   I live between Indianapolis & Detroit.  And that was the direction of their movement, heading towards Detroit. Then I saw another one & another one & another one.  I watched this line of lights for about 10 minutes.  I counted 32 in all.  All moving on the same path, heading northeast.  They were not moving fast, just about the speed of an orbiting satellite.  I donâ€™t think was a normal event.;41.4732000000002;-84.5593999999995
