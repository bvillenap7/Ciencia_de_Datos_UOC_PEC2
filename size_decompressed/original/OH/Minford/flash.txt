Crackling sound, flash, and then swoosh sound.;1987-06-01 20:00:00;10 Seconds;Crackling sound, flash, and then swoosh sound. I was walking from my aunts house down the road to my house. This took place in the country. I was by myself just up to my driveway when I suddenly heard a crackling sound and then as I turned around and looked up to the sky I saw a flash of light and I heard a swoosh sound. That was it. I was only 13 years old at the time and when I mentioned it to my science teacher he said it was possible that it could have been a meteor. I just was scared and excited at the same time. The incident took place in the dark and the sky was completly clear. ((NUFORC Note:  We agree with the assessment by the science teacher, I.e. that the incident may have been caused by a meteor, or a meteor fragment.  However, if the timing of the incident, as described as the witness, is correct, the event seems somewhat inconsistent with a meteor.   The witness probably should have seen the flash, then a boom, if the meteor was close.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));38.8739;-82.8548
