Then out instantly.. no craft..no sound..just out Daughter and I driving in evening last night around 8:00 pm in Fayette Cty.  Ohio.  Beautiful sky filled with tons of bright stars.  Noticed several planes to left.   All of a sudden I noticed these 3 large yellowish, bright lights that are making a u-turn low and to the right.  Now their facing our direction and then a 4th light joins them.  They are all lined up perfectly. .then gone..just puff lights out..no sound...nothing.   Never seen any outline of craft nothing only 4 large (like semi headlights) compared to stars and those planes.  Daughter was driving so I have no doubt or fear in what I know we saw tonight.;39.5370000000001;-83.4550000000006
