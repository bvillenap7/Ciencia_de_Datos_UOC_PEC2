3 yellowish-orange circular spheres in sky;2012-11-27 18:15:00;20 seconds;3 yellowish-orange circular spheres in sky Three yellowish-orange lights in consistent formation, occasionally vanishing, and re-appearing. Objects were slow moving, but light never flickered or flashed like a helicopter, or aircraft. At first, one vanished while the other two remained. Then the second vanished as well. The third lingered for a few minutes afterwards, flying in a lateral movement, frequently stopping in place. Visibility of the object went in and out for about for 20 seconds or so, and then the object finally disappeared.;39.5370000000001;-83.4550000000006
Very bright orb looking light.;2014-03-07 00:10:00;2-3 minutes;Very bright orb looking light. My mom and I were looking up at the sky, when suddenly we saw this bright light coming down.  We stared at it for 2 or 3 min then it shot strait up.   10 min later a friend of mine text me out of the blue to tell me he had just seen a similar thing where he lives in Columbus.;39.5370000000001;-83.4550000000006
