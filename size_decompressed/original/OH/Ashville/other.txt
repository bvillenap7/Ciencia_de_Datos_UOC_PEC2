Weird brown triangular object;1999-09-19 11:00:00;2 sec;Weird brown triangular object I was working on the computer that morning and it was a nice day out..all of the sudden, the house creaked as if a HUGE gust of wind hit it from the east side..then it stopped and I heard a sound that sounded like heavy rain or hail..then it stopped..I looked outside during this to see how windy it was and it was just a light breeze the whole time and it was sunny..after the hailing sound stopped, an object appeared outside my window..I was at an akward position, so I couldn't judge the distance except that it wasn't near my window..it was a brown object that was shaped like two isosoles (sp?) triangles with the points pointing downward and each of them had one of their tips conect with the other shape's tips..The object slowly moved diagonally down from East to West.. I thought maybe it was a bat, but the bats we get here are as small as field mice and this was MUCH larger..also, I like bats, so I would've seen the head of it and it's feet or wing shape and I would've thought Oh, how cute!!..I got a good look at this thing and it wasn't a bat..it had smooth flat edges from what I could see..it also couldn't be a leaf because the nearest tree is accross the street (around 150 feet) and the leaves were still green..
