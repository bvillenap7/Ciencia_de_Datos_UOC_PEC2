While out walking the dog and observing constellations 6 craft in Vformation flew by at an incredible speed.I was looking at Orion and they appeared at that level,North and East of Orion.Direction flying due west.There were three on each side of the v and the middle craft on the north side veered out and then back in formation.They were not real bright....only as bright as a faint star.They were well below the rest of the planes in the sky at the level of Orion at 6:45.No noise at all.Much faster than any plane for sure.All the dogs in the neighborhood were barking.;39.7281;-82.9435
