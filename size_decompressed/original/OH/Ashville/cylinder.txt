Three and four brights orbs flahing and eventually combining to make two orbs;2013-07-06 21:00:00;3-5 minutes;three and four brights orbs flahing and eventually combining to make two orbs my 4 friends and i were driving when we saw two white lights in the sky. we were watching and then it turned into three. Next thing we knew there was a fourth. one faded out and then reappeared.  eventually the two of the orbs went into the other two and darted off. while we were watching they were moving left to right very fast. there is a video on YouTube i found of people in Columbus that saw what i saw. a person also comments on the page near where i was and said she saw it also.;39.7281;-82.9435
