A bright, shiny, metalic looking object fell downwards in the sky.;2007-12-12 17:52:00;2 seconds;A bright, shiny, metalic looking object fell downwards in the sky. While driving today, a friend and I looked out the front windshield of her car, and saw something bright fall from the sky. It fell down diagonally to the right. The sky was somewhat cloudy, and it was still bright outside, making it clearly not a shooting star, since no other stars were visible. The object looked bigger and closer than a star, and also had a shimmer to it to make it seem as if it were made of metal. The object went for a distance of about one fist (meaning if you extend your arm, aim it to the sky, and close on eye, the object traveled from the top of the fist to the bottom). This occurred at 5:52 PM on Wednesday, December 12, 2007, while driving south on Jameson Street in Ashville, Ohio.;39.7281;-82.9435
