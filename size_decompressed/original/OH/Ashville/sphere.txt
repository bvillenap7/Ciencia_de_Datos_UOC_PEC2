I was looking up at the sky and  all of a sudden, I saw a shiny metallic balloon-like object floating in the air.  I looked at it for several seconds.  As I was almost finished hunting, I thought maybe I would shoot at it, for target practice.  Then all of a sudden, in the blink of an eye, it darted off to the right, and in a blur it was gone.  I continued to stare at the sky wondering what had just happened, and thinking it may re-appear.  After several minutes I came to the conclusion that I might have just seen a UFOâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.7281;-82.9435
