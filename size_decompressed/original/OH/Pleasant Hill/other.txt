Two horseshoe crab shaped objects moving in unison made an abrupt 90 degree turn then climbed in elevation until they dissappeared;2011-06-01 15:20:00;~40 seconds;Two horseshoe crab shaped objects moving in unison made an abrupt 90 degree turn then climbed in elevation until they dissappeared I was traveling east on Sugar grove Rd approximately .6 miles from State Route 48 I saw two objects fly out from behind a barn on the North side of the road heading South at approximately 50 to 75 feet of elevation.  As both objects approached the roadway the simultaneously made sharp 90 degree turn heading East above the road, then they both climbed in altitude until they disappeared into low lying clouds. Both objects were as best as I can describe, similar in shape to that of a horseshoe crab. The color of both was a light blue/grey that almost blended with the color of the sky. Approximate size I would judge to be 40 to 48 inches wide. I would estimate the speed of the objects during the sighting to be 80 to 100 mph. I was approximately .2 miles from the objects when the sighting occurred. The sighting lasted approximately 40 seconds. I have seen lots of aircraft in my life being the son of a USAF veteran, but have never seen anything like this before. It left a great impression on me and is something I will never forget. The following link that I am including is a picture that I found on the internet that shows an object that is very similar to the object that I witnessed: http://www.thetruthbehindthescenes.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/horseshoe-UFO-south-korea.jpg ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
