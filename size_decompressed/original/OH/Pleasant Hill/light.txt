Very fast and erratic light seen in the sky around Troy, OH.;2012-05-27 23:40:00;2 minutes;Very fast and erratic light seen in the sky around Troy, OH. My friend and I were finishing up a night of shooting the breeze and satellite watching. He looked up and said, What kind of airplane is that?  I looked and saw a flashing light about 60 degrees up and 15 degrees right of north. The light was a little brighter than the stars in the big dipper and pure white.  It would blink twice within a second and be dark for about 3 seconds. It was moving in a very quick and erratic way with no discernable pattern.  It seemed to be about the altitude of a commercial jet. It stayed in that general area of the sky for about 2 minutes then moved behind the neighborâ€™s roof.  It came back into view on the other side of their roof 10 seconds later.  Where it blinked 3 more times and disappeared. Within 2 minutes more we saw it blink 3 more times and disappear, but now it was about due south.  Another minute later we saw it blink 2 more times back at its original NNW position.  We stayed out for another 45 minutes waiting for it to reappear, to no avail. I have worked for a commercial airline for 11 years the other witness is an MBA with a large technology company.  We are both 31 years of age. No drugs or alcohol were involved in this observation and neither of us had ever seen anything like it.;40.0568;-84.3413
