I got home from church and was talking with my parents about my day.  Looking around in the sky an object, like a perfect white sphere was heading west against the wind.  I couldn't hear anything and it was pretty high in the sky.   I've never seen anything like it in my life, I don't understand how a ballon or something round like that was heading west against the wind as fast and straight as this was.   After seeing it travel west for 15-20 seconds, it was too far to see.   It was awesome!;40.0568;-84.3413
