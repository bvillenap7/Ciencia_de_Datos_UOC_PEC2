Three bright objects would appear and disappear covering great distances in the night sky.;2000-12-08 20:00:00;2 hrs. to ?;Three bright objects would appear and disappear covering great distances in the night sky. I had just got in from work and went outside to check the christmas lights, when I looked up at the night sky and off in the distance I saw what I thought was an air craft light. As I continued to watch this light I noticed it would travel across the  horizon it would travel slowly ,seem to stop or disappear and reappear a great distance away. It would jump from one spot to another very quickly.Soon another light appeared above the first and another above the second light and all three objects traveled together then would split up in different directions and then reappear one ontop of the other as if looking for something. I watched this for a couple of hours off and on. Because of the cold weather I finally went in for the night. I tried to video tape the objects ,but my camera would not focus inthe night sky.;39.0299;-82.8499
a white light moving in a circle.;2009-10-01 20:30:00;3 hrs;a white light moving in a circle. There is a white light moving in a circle pattern. my wife and 3 kids all saw it going around and around like a fixed position light but the fixed position would have to be in the sky, because the pattern is too small to be from a light somewhere, say if it where from a tower, it would have a mutch larger pattern.;39.0299;-82.8499
