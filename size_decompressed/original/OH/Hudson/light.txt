Two distant orange/red lights cross sky and suddenly disappear.;2011-09-16 20:45:00;2 minutes;Two distant orange/red lights cross sky and suddenly disappear. While looking outside my window, I noticed two distant lights in the sky coming closer. They were traveling in the same direction at the same speed.  Both were orange-red in color without any blinking lights.  Both were constant lights that seemed circular and bigger in circumference than an aircraft.  I tried filming, but my camera wouldn’t focus…so the film doesn’t look great and have much detail. I ran to show my husband, came back outside and the one leading started to flicker in place and disappeared.  The second one reached the same spot, started to flicker as if rising in altitude and disappeared.;41.2479000000001;-81.4349000000002
