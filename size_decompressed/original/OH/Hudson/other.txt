At about 19:04 -19:05 hrs I was sitting in my family room(main level of house)watching television. The large window next to the television has a half moon window above it. I witnessed a large  long continuous light passing across it slowly. I often see aircraft passing in the night, but this was huge, bright and moving slowly. I jumped up from the sofa and ran to the window. Looking up  at this moving light I noticed many, many smaller whitish lights moving alongside the huger light. I was alittle scared because it was like nothing I had seen before. I have seen meteorites flashing across the sky in arches, but this moved slowly and in a straight direction. I would say from the position of the window that I saw this from, that it was moving in a north easterly direction. It looked like a large passenger train, deep and long in shape. I ran to my front door and outside believing that because it was moving so slowly that I would continue to be able to see it, but it had already moved out of vision. I called my husband at the hospital, where he works to tell him and to see if anyone else had seen this. Later in th evening on the news, other people described that they had also been witness to this strange phenomena.;41.2479000000001;-81.4349000000002
