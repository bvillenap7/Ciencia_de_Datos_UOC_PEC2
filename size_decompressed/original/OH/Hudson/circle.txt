At first I thought it was a group of birds, but as I watched they mouved around much too fast to be birds and much to high. They were straight up in the sky and it was clear out. The sun was reflecting off of them some what as it was setting in the west. It was hard for me to judge how high up these objects were but a small aircraft passed under them as I watched which led me to believe they were very high up. One of the objects moved out of the cluster and moved towards the north. The rest of the objects started kind of lining up in a regimented order and started moving with the one that seperated from them. In a blink of an eye they were gone!;41.2479000000001;-81.4349000000002
2 Milky White Bright Orbs Dancing in the Sky over Hudson, Ohio.;2014-01-30 22:30:00;25 minutes;2 Milky White Bright Orbs Dancing in the Sky over Hudson Ohio I was taking the trash out when I looked to the sky and saw two milky white light balls dancing around.... flying in circles, sometimes following a pattern, sometimes not.   Sometimes quick zags and bolts across to the other side of their area of flight.  Sometimes it looked like they would collide, but didn't.  It reminded me of the way orientals fly those kites on the short strings where they look like they are dancing.  Anyway, they continued to do this in the sky for about 25 minutes.  I actually had to follow it down the driveway a bit to keep them in range.  (We live on a farm on a long driveway)  There was no noise, and it was actually quite beautiful.  Then one just went POOF and disappeared.  The other continued to fly for a minute and then POOF!  That one disappeared too.  I AM NOW A BELIEVER!!!!  I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES!!!!!  And... a car driving down the road also saw them.  They stopped in the road, and put their flashers on, and watched for! a while.  I wish I had my camera on me at the time!;41.2479000000001;-81.4349000000002
Multi-colored circular object with easy bounce, changed colors and stayed in one place.;2014-04-19 22:00:00;15+ minutes;Multi-colored circular object with easy bounce, changed colors and stayed in one place. Far off and low in the south west sky we witnessed a circular multicolored bright light that changed colors (red, blue, orange, white) with an easy bounce to it up, down, left and right.   We watched for 15 minutes or so and then when inside.  Looked out again about 15/20 minutes later and it was gone.  Tried to capture on video but too far away.
