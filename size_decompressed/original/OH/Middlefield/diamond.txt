I looked above us to the night sky to see a solitary bluish light about 2 miles about my head... sry I don't know wind/air travel measurements.  What is that?I told my boyfriend to look and to our amazement it hovered above us and start to head NE, slow enough for me to run into the house and get 2 sets of binoculars so we could get a better look. Once zoomed in with a 10Ã—50 I could barely see the craft that carried this blue light. Also, the aircraft made no sound. Not one! Above the light was pure shadow. I couldn't even make out the shape. For the rest of the night planes of all sizes went by because I live next an airport about 2 mi away each one that went by i stated thats not what it looked like. he smiled,Come on. U already know. We do have a video of last night's event!  I also have a video of the very first ones I saw a few years ago. To this day I have seen nothing like it!;41.446;-81.0425999999999
