A bright beam of light appeared in between our two cars, and suddenly both vehicles lost power. My engine, lights, etc. cut out immediately. At first I thought it was a problem with my truck, but then noticed that the other car was dead, too. This lasted for approximately three minutes. There was just bright light with no sound at all. Then, the light disappeared and electrical power turned back on in both of our vehicles. Nothing major happened, just lost radio presets and the clock. Now, neither seem to want to be reset.;41.446;-81.0425999999999
