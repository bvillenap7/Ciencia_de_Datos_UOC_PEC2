Triangle aircraft observed with Night Vision Goggles, could not be seen with naked eye.;2010-03-09 02:35:00;20 seconds;Triangle aircraft observed with Night Vision Goggles, could not be seen with naked eye. I am an EMS helicopter pilot.   Recently we began using the ANVIS9 night vision goggles for night operations.  On Tuesday morning March 9th, at 02:35, I was outside of our base operations adjusting my goggles and witnessed a triangle aircraft flying from south to north at what I approximate to be about 4000 feet.  If I were to stretch out my arm and hold my thumb and index finger apart one inch, that would be the size.   It had four lights of equal brightness per side.  I couldn’t tell color as the NVG’s are monochromatic green.   I lifted them up and the aircraft could not be seen, back down, clearly visible.   It was moving at a steady speed like that of a corporate jet.  In my field of view to out of view was about 20 seconds.  However, there was no sound.  This particular night sky was extremely clear, no clouds.   ANVIS9’s are third generation NVG, same as the military uses and amplify light 10,000 times.   When looking up the sky looks like a Hubble photograph with more stars than I have ever seen in my life.  This was very clearly a triangle shape of lights larger than any of the stars in the background. ((NUFORC Note:  One of two excellent reports from this source.
