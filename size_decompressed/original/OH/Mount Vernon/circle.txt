Pale yellow sphere over Ohio seen by one.;2008-06-30 23:00:00;15 minutes;Pale yellow sphere over Ohio seen by one. I was coming home from work, when I noticed a light in the sky.  I thought it was the moon cause of the size.  But as i got closer to home it was more visible.  It look like a big pale yellow bug light, with smaller multicolored light circling it.  The night sky was clear so I could see it clearly.  I just dismissed it and went back inside.  There was no sound and it was traveling subsonic.  No sonic boom.;40.3869000000002;-82.4901000000005
3 orange glowing lights forming a large triangle;2011-08-20 20:55:00;90 seconds;3 orange glowing lights forming a large triangle 8/20/2011 Mount Vernon, OH At approximately 8:55p.m.  I went outside to our patio with my dogs.  An orange glowing light caught my attention in the SE sky.  It seemed to grow in size then all of a sudden there were two more.  The 3 lights formed a very large triangle.  They were all about the same size and looked to be moving very slowly towards the  NW.  I yelled for my husband to come outside and he also saw the lights.  No sound.  Seemed to be pulsating.  A couple of times one or more of the lights would appear to go out and then reappear.  Then all three lights just disappeared. This was something definitely weird!;40.3869000000002;-82.4901000000005

Large bright white light moving up to the sky.;2016-06-15 20:25:00;4 minutes;large bright white light moving up to the sky. I seen what looked to be a single very bright star in the sky after severe thunderstorm.  There was still a lot of clouds in the sky but this single star stood out and was bright.  It slowly floated up, very slowly at first.   I waited for it to get closer thinking it was a helicopter coming closer.  It passed behind a tree in the distance.  I waited for it to pop up over the top of the tree.  When it did the light was much fainter and smaller.   There wasn't enought time that had passed for a helicopter to be that close to me and my husband then get that far away so suddenly.  Then it progressed upwards at a faster rate behind the cloud coverage.  My husband said he seen the exact same thing a few weeks ago while at work during 3rd shift.;40.3869000000002;-82.4901000000005
