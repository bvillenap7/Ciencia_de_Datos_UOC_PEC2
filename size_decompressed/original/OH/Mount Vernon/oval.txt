Sitting in my Yard facing west,and a silent dark lower flying craft went directly over me.  I watched it fly over for 20 seconds total.  It was long oval black with two dim long red lights that stretched across width of craft.  Looking at it it looked like i was looking at the bottom of a boat, and made no noise and moved very swift.
