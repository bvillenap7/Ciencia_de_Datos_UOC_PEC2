Orange light pattern in the sky.;2013-12-09 18:00:00;5-10 minutes;Orange light pattern in the sky December 9, 2013 Mount Vernon, Ohio  As I was driving home on Fairway Drive just before 8 p.m., I saw some (two) lights. At first I thought it was the lights for a radio tower because they were spaced at specific intervals in a vertical position.  But as I drove a bit more a third to the left then a another to the right appeared and I thought the shape to be a square when two more appeared and it was a rectangular shape of orange –ish lights.  I got out of my car to see it better and to determine if it was a plane or helicopter going to a near-by hospital.  I watched it move very slowly in formation. ….not making a sound and that is when I tried to take a picture.  My cell phone could not pick it up because of the darkness.  Then I tried to call my husband because I knew that this was nothing I could explain.  It was a bit cloudy that night but I thought this to be below the clouds. I could not detect a body to this phenomenom…only the lights …  The quiet or silence disturbed me.  It was directly overhead moving slowly…then gone. I wrote Linda Moulton Howe to see if she had heard other reports.  The next day I called the sheriff’s department but no other reports.  I know that I saw something.  It was NOT the radio tower as I first thought for it is in another direction.  This had to have been over the Hiawatha Golf Course and moving to the northeast, possibly following state route 3.;40.3869000000002;-82.4901000000005
