But to my shock was three round orb's forming a triangle coming from the stratosphere at a steep angle until it was right above and it front of me prob 1000 ft. or so then it went strait for a second dropped strait down hundreds of ft and went strait again all in one fluid motion in a matter of 3 seconds i got a good look of under it and it was invisible but the orbs stayed in the same triangle pattern  It started out Northwest then headed Northeast;40.3869000000002;-82.4901000000005
