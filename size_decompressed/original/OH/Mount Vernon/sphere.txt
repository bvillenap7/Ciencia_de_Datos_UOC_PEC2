Strange lights over Mt Vernon, Ohio.;2015-01-10 20:30:00;3 minutes;Strange lights over Mt Vernon, Ohio. Seen a bright white light with green and red lights around it. I thought it was an ambulance, got my binoculars, all the lights were separated and the bright light went away, and only saw red and green in the distance, moving fast down and out, one went to the left and one to the right.   I then realized it was not a helicopter or ambulance. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume a date in 2015, and have changed the date above.
