Blue green lights over southen ohio;2001-04-07 00:05:00;30 min;Blue green lights over southen ohio was out side watching a passing storm to the north with a great lighting show (was by myself)the sky was clear behind the storm to the west. a bright blue green light about the size of a dime poped up above the tree line to the north west and climed upward to about 90deg. from the ground. it then stoped and stayed idle for about 3 min then moved horizontal northeast bound untill it entered the storm and vanished. I watched for maybe 2more min. when another one showed up almost where the frist one appered. I went into the house and got the others who were playing cards to come look and conferm I wasent going nutty. they saw it to and watched with me as the lights moved up and down and back and forth then vanish, sometimes changing color from bluegreen to a super bright orange before they would vanished. shortly after we saw the last one air traffic in the area (jets) was considablely more than at any time Ican remember.;38.9177;-83.9978999999999
