My family (mom and dad and siblings) and I were on our way home from grocery shopping at McMakens IGA.  As we were heading towards Westbrook road we say a light that was coming across the road and it wasn't much higher then the treetops as it came across the road behind us it didn't make any sound at all.   My dad asked which way it went and we all said it went to the west, so my dad turned right on Westbrook road and as we looked out across the field we could see it and it went over to the top of a woods and started dropping different colored lights out of it and towards the ground.   As my dad made it around to the road that went by the woods the UFO disappeared and we never saw it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
