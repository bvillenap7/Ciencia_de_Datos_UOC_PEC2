Four white lights moving into random formations seen above trees;2012-07-14 21:45:00;0:45;Four white lights moving into random formations seen above trees It was dusk, and while driving we noticed a large white light in the sky to the Southeast. It was mostly cloudy, and it was hovering well below the clouds, fairly close to the tree horizon in the distance. It was approx. 6-8 times the size of a normal bright star, so it caught our attention very quickly. Shortly thereafter another light appeared below it, then another, and then one more.  They were all moving slowly and together formed a skinny trapezoid shape.  They continued to move around a bit, some much faster than others, and took other formations (perfect square, another trapezoid).  A couple of them slowly disappeared and reappeared as they moved around as well, almost twinkling at times. They eventually all moved below the tree horizon in the distance. It's hard to say how far away they may have been, but my guess would be ~3-5 miles. The three observers are all between the ages of 28-32, upper middle class, two males and one female. No one was under the influence of any drugs or alcohol.  We were coming home from a jog and the grocery - we tried to take a couple pictures but they were too blurry in the low light.;39.8411;-84.4182999999999
