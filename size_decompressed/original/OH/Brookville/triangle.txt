Three red lights in Triangular shape, intercepted by small plane, then moves away.;2006-05-07 21:30:00;15 Minutes;Three red lights in Triangular shape, intercepted by small plane, then moves away. Last night my mother and I were on our way home from church, driving on a country road. Now I'm an A+ student in High School and i've researched UFO's before, but this really had me confused.  It was about 9:30 and we noticed 3 red lights that were in the sky.  At first I suspected it to be an aircraft coming in for landing, but then I noticed that it wasn't moving fast enough.   Looking at it further, we could see that they weren't separate aircrafts either, because the area between the 3 lights was a different shade of black than the rest of the sky.   Then a regular airplane came over, it looked to be on an intercept course.  We could then see how big the UFO actually was.  It had to be at least 20 times the size of the airplane that intercepted it.   We tried following the UFO but it seemed to be traveling faster and faster, finally moving too far away to see.;39.8411;-84.4182999999999
