Star in center of south-eastern &quotcross&quot constellation hovering around, Cuyahoga Valley Ohio;2020-08-15 22:40:00;3 minutes;Star in center of south-eastern &quotcross&quot constellation hovering around, Cuyahoga Valley Ohio While stargazing in a place without much light pollution, I focused on a star directly centered in the cross section of a cross-shaped constellation, approximately halfway up the sky and almost directly southward but slightly to the east. This star had stayed directly where the two lines of this cross constellation crossed for at least 20 minutes, not moving.  It suddenly moved downward and to the left of the cross section point where it was previously, then slowly hovered above and below the horizontal cross line before settling just above the line and slightly to the left of the vertical cross line. It then did not move for at least a half hour, at which point we left.  I know that its movement wasn't just my eyes playing tricks because I used the horizontal and vertical cross lines as a frame of reference. My friend was looking at a different star close by and said they saw it move at the same moments I saw my star moving, but at the time I thought they were referring to my star.  Afterwards my friend said they think the movement they saw was just their eyes playing tricks, which along with the confusion about us looking at different stars has made me doubt my own sighting.  However, I know that I saw it move especially because I kept comparing its position with the stable cross constellation.;41.2352;-81.6455
