White light being followed by a small plane;2012-03-13 22:10:00;60 seonds;a white light being followed by a small plane Me an my boyfriend were having dinner outside looking at the stars when we observed several planes.  On our way home we noticed a plane flying kind of low it was loud an we believe it to be a small single propeller plain with a small white light approximately 2-300 feet in front of it.  The light was to far ahead to be part of the plane it was a very unusual site.  I believe the plane was chasing the light they were both way lower then usual aircraft in our area an moved fairly quickly i ran up the road to try an watch them further an they were already gone.;39.9707;-80.7669
