Orange glowing arrowhead observed for approximately 3 minutes in nighttime sky over Cleveland and heading west.;2013-07-05 23:30:00;2-3 minutes;Orange glowing arrowhead observed for approximately 3 minutes in nighttime sky over Cleveland and heading west. One orange arrowhead shaped craft, flying in a slow arc from north of Rocky River (over downtown Cleveland) in a southwesterly direction, to just north of Rocky River, then changing direction and flying due west for about a minute at low speed, finally turning north and fading into distance.  Distinctly arrow head shape.   Entire object was illuminated, not at all similar to an object with lights on its periphery.  Only one color observed - orange.  No white, red, nor green (as a commercial aircraft would have displayed).  No flashing lights, only solid glowing orange.   There were clouds in the sky, fairly low, but this object was well below the altitude of the clouds.  Total observation time was almost three minutes.   Object made no sound whatsoever (we were in a quiet neighborhood walking our dog). Normally an aircraft at this altitude would be audible.  Very odd!;41.4694;-81.8541
