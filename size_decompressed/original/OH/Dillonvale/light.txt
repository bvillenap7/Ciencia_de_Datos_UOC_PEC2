A friend and I were watching a fireworks display after dark and we saw a single white light craft come down and stop at say 10,000 feet, higher than any of the fireworks.  It zipped around in straight lines but changed direction at sharp angles, like when one draws a five-point star.  It had a short trail of light, traveled thousands of feet in tenths of a second, and paused for tenths of a second at the vertices.  It then disappeared back up into the sky.  This event only lasted for about 3 or 4 seconds.  It wasn't a plane or helicopter, nor was it a firework.;40.2274;-80.7944
