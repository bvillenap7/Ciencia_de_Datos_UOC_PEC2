Bright Blue Craft Over Laura, Ohio's Night Sky;2008-10-29 21:20:00;5-10 seconds;Bright Blue Craft Over Laura, Ohio's Night Sky I am reporting this about 25 minutes after the sighting. I saw a very bright blue light (looked a bit like a fireball) speed across my street and it looked as if it crashed in the woods across the road. The sky is and was completely dark. If I had to take a guess, I would say that the object was the size of a small car. It was traveling at a very fast speed. It was fast and close enough that I was expecting to see some sort of explosion or hear some sort of explosion come from the woods, but nothing. Almost immediately I drove my car through a path in the woods, but I saw nothing. I got a bit creeped out so I didn't give a big investigation! Haha. The bad thing is that I am the only one that saw this object (as far as I know) and it is just another sighting that doesnt provide much hard evidence! - I plan to go out tomorrow morning to see if any evidence can be found.;39.9754;-84.396
