Green Blue and Red circular craft over West Portsmouth, Ohio right beside cellular tower 50 to 100 yards off the ground.;2016-09-13 21:00:00;1 hour;Green Blue and Red circular craft over West Portsmouth, Ohio, right beside cellular tower 50 to 100 yards off the ground. I walked out on my porch in Rosemount Ohio around 9pm and over West Portsmouth, Ohio, right beside the cell phone tower, I saw a circular object just sitting still with a green blue, and red light that seemed to be emitting from the craft.  I know it wasn't a star because of how low it was to the hilltop.  It just sat still in mid air for 30 mins.  I walked inside to get my camara, and it had landed in the woods right beside the tower.  I could still see the green blue and red light emitting through the trees.  The lights would go off and on every 20 or 30 seconds.  I watched this object for over an hour.I called to tell my girlfriend what i had witnessed and she saw the  same thing the night before from her job in Portsmouth, Ohio.  She described the exact same thing I saw with green blue and red lights before i ever described to her what I had witnessed, that really freaked me out.  I know it was not a plane, helicopter, or star.  It was to bright and to big. I hope som! eone else saw what we witnessed. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been looking at a so-called twinkling star.  They are very colorful.  PD));38.7495;-83.1335
