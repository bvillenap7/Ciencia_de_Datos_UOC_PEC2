In the 1970's, I was about 15 yrs old, living north of Dayton in an area called Huber Heights, just several miles south of I-70. It was a crisp, cold, clear fall night. I walked out the back door to feed my dog, hurrying because it was cold and I didn't have a jacket.  I was maybe 20 feet from the house when something made me stop. (I'm getting shivers just remembering this) I looked up in the sky and almost overhead, hovering in total silence, was a large saucer shaped craft.  It seemed close enough to reach out and touch, but of course it really wasn't. It had trapazoidal shaped white lights? Or windows of light?, that rotated around the craft, from left to right, skipping every other panel. The trapazoids were narrower at the top, wider at the bottom. I just stood there staring at it in total shock I guess, for who knows how long. I remember screaming, dropping the dog food and running for the house. When I started running, it started moving, heading west at an extremely high rate of speed. Remember, I lived near Wright-Pat, had been to the Dayton Air Show, had seen fighter planes and the blue angels. I knew what a plane looked like in the sky. I had never seen anything moving at the speed this thing attained. By the time I could get my father and air force uncle to the door, maybe a span of 20-30 seconds, it was nearly out of sight on the horizon. My uncle said he had never seen anything move so fast. I have always wondered if anyone else saw anything in the sky that night in Ohio. Later in life, I learned about Roswell, aliens, UFO's, and watched shows about Hanger 18 at Wright-Pat. I've wondered if this was reverse technology in action. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.8377999999998;-84.1110999999993

My brother came with me, we went around the back of the house. I grabed the ball, and we headed back inside. But I got this weird feeling to look up, so I look up and saw this china dish shaped thing. I noughed my brother and told him to look up. We look at it for about 2 or so mins. It was hovering over a Football field next to my house. It did not move much, but it went from left to right a few times, like it was checking something out. But then it headed out at a slow pace, I think it was to the South. While doing so it like became invisable. After that I did not see it again. Let me say that it was about 200 or so yards up in the air it was very visable. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.8377999999998;-84.1110999999993
