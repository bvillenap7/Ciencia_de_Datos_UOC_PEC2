I have experienced encounters with unusual beings of about 3 to 3.5 feet tall. One of the beings identified itself as zeta reticuli (taller more slender one). I have  experienced undesirable interactions with these entities. I have witnessed non-conventionally explainable phenomenom, unexplained lights and events. I have 3 neighbors who have seen the craft along with my mother and myself in our neighborhood in the evenings close to dusk. I and my brother have personally seen the entities. I have unusual scarring body marks that show up seemingly overnight and mental and physical interactions often over the last two months. THe entities also do not appear to be going away with or without sightings of crafts. They appear to be watching members of our household and interacting with us passively during the day and more active during the eve. PLEASE Call me ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

There was an object floating in the sky in Dayton, Ohio.;2013-02-20 21:15:00;5 minutes;There was an object floating in the sky in Dayton, Ohio I just let my dog out and he started barking.  I thought the neighbor’s dog was out.   He was looking at the roof of the house though.  So I thought maybe there was a squirrel up there.   He then jumped forward so I decided to go out and see what had him so wound up.  There was a dark object floating, moving very slowly.  It is too dark here to really get a better description.  There were no lights at all.  It kind of reminded me of a hot air balloon the way it was hanging.  There was also no sound.   I watched it from the side and then from the rear for about 4 minutes as it disappeared into the dark.  Not once did a light flash or a sound come from it.  There is an airport near here and an Air force Base.  I just found it odd that an object would be out at night near an airport (about 5 miles away) with no lights.  Also, the Base is about 5 miles away as well.   Just thought I would see if anyone else had seen it.  This is the first time my dog has ever barked at something i! n the sky.;39.8377999999998;-84.1110999999993
11-12 Fast Flying Objects over Dayton, Ohio Suburb  ((Spacelink satellites));2020-03-07 19:30:00;45 seconds;11-12 Fast Flying Objects over Dayton, Ohio Suburb 7 March 2020 Huber Heights, Ohio (Dayton, Ohio Suburb)  At approximately 1930 hrs. this evening, I took my dog out to use the restroom.  It was just past dusk.  As I was standing and waiting for my dog to relieve herself, I had looked up to the sky to glance at the almost full moon. Still waiting for my dog and having turned the opposite direction, I looked up to see the bright star (planet Venus) and noticed what I thought was going to be a shooting star.  The “shooting star” did not shoot, however was moving very fast.  I then noticed the immediately behind it was another “shooting star”, and then another.  They were moving very rapidly, were equally spaced apart. I got my wife from inside and had her come outside quickly.  She likewise witnessed the objects, to which we now counted eleven or twelve before they vanished out of sight.  Again, each spaced equally apart, moving very rapidly. These objects were too high to be normal aircraft.  There were no flashing lights like would be observed on commercial aircraft. Being outside of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, you would surmise that it might be military aircraft on the move in or out of the base, but again, these objects were too high.  There was no noise to be heard from the objects, just very faint light. The objects were moving from the southwest to the northeast;39.8377999999998;-84.1110999999993
