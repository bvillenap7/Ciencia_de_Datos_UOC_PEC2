Black triangle, row of amber lights on the back and one red blinking light centered underneath;2020-11-12 03:45:00;5 minutes;Black triangle, row of amber lights on the back and one red blinking light centered underneath I'm a truck driver and on the early morning of November 12th I saw an unidentified flying object. Around 03:45 am along I-70 heading east off to my left I saw an object, triangular in shape. Around the Huber heights area in Ohio approximately 200 feet off the ground flying in a NE direction towards Springfield Ohio. It was black in color on the back a row of lights amber in color went from left to right all across the back. On the underside dead center was a single red light that was flashing. It was about 500 meters off to my left north of I-70 at that distance it was massive. No apparent sound, I was traveling at 65 mphi estimate it was doing maybe 80 to 90 mph. About 5 minutes before it was out of view, I had no safe place to pull over in my truck to get my phone out. On the bottom edges were faint white lights the length of all 3 sides. I couldnâ€™t estimate the size but it was massive. I'm prior military and I know that was no plane currently in our air force or civilian inventory.;39.8377999999998;-84.1110999999993
