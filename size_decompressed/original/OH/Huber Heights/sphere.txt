UFO over huber heights, ohio;2012-08-19 23:00:00;10 minutes;UFO over huber heights, ohio It was around 11pm I was sitting outside talking to my neighbor. It was a quiet night no noise at all aside from our conversation.  She interrupted me and asked what was that in the sky I glanced over and said it was probably a helicopter.  After about thirty seconds I hushed her and realized there was absolutely no noise at all.  I then paid further attention to the object in the sky. It came from the north over the apartment buildings.  It was glowing orange traveling like a plane would except it was spinning.  As it was directly over us it stopped and hovered and then the spinning was more like a gyroscope. It spun on all axis and then abruptly stopped.  It sat there for a few minutes.  I tried to take a video of it but it wouldn’t show up on the video.  I switched over to camera and then out of like 20 pictures was able to get it to show up on only one.  About that time it started to spin up again and then moved southwards it didn’t move fast but it was steady.  A very controlled movement, as if it was being controlled.  When it  got a little further away it got extremely brighter than in a blink of an eye it was gone.  I have a photo but I don’t know how to upload it or even if I can.;39.8377999999998;-84.1110999999993
Orange spheres in a triangular pattern.;2013-07-19 22:15:00;~1 minute;orange spheres in a triangular pattern At approximately 10:15 pm, est, tonight, my husband and I were standing on our deck, when coming from the SW heading NE over our house, we noticed three orange spheres moving in a triangular pattern (there was no noise that we could hear).    I came inside to grab my cell phone, and when I returned to the deck (less than 10 seconds), only  two orange spheres remained (I have pictures, although they are kind of grainy), within seconds, both of those spheres disappeared.   As we stood there, trying to make sense of what we had just seen, a single bright white light (and no, it  was not a star, more in common with a spotlight) as I turned my cell phone on to take a picture, it too disappeared.;39.8377999999998;-84.1110999999993
