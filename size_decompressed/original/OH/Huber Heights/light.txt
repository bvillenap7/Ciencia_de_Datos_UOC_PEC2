Orange lights over Huber Heights, Ohio.;2012-10-30 22:00:00;10 minutes;Orange lights over Huber Heights, Ohio. My mother had stepped outside to have a smoke.  After a minute she called for both my father and I to come outside.  We came outside and in the sky were two bright lights in the sky coming from the west over the houses across the street.  These two lights kept perfect distance from one another and proceeded to come east so they would be located above our house.   One light was leading and the other was right behind it and slightly offset.  They moved at a steady pace that was not very fast but it wasn't slow either.  The lights stayed the same very bright deep orange, there was no trail or blinking as they moved.   Once the lights got to the point where they were right above our section of the street the light that was in front completely stopped.  The light that was trailing behind it continued to move until it was almost next to it.   At that point in time a cloud blew in and obstructed our view.  I stayed to see if the lights were there after the cloud passed but they! were gone.;39.8377999999998;-84.1110999999993
