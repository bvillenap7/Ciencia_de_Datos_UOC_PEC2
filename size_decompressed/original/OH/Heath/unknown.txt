This happened on 11/30/07    I was sitting in my car today in the Kroger parking-lot in Heath, Ohio. I was looking up at the sky watching airplanes going across  twords the N.W. part of the sky. Within 5 Min time there was at least 12 jets all heading what seemed like the same location in the sky I watched them for a few more Min. And then there was a really  bright light  in the same general direction. It would get bigger an then get smaller, and when it moved from a stop, it would much faster then the planes did. Much FASTER. It looked like  the planes were trying to meet up with it. But then they all went away in deferent directions. Then the bright light came twords my direction and then disappeared. This was about 3:30 PM. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));40.0192;-82.3849
