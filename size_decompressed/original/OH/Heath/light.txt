bright light being followed by jets, till it out flew them, and they left.;2007-11-30 15:30:00;about 15 min;bright light being followed by jets, till it out flew them, and they left. I was sitting in my car today in the Krpger parking-lot in Heath, Ohio. I was looking up at the sky watching airplanes going across  twords the N.W. part of the sky. Within 5 Min time there was at least 12 jets all heading what seemed like the same location in the days I watched them for a few more Min. And then there was a leally bright light  in the same general direction. It would get bagger an then get smaller, and when it moved from a stop, it would much faster then the planes did. Much FASTER. It looked like  the planes were trying to meet up with it. But then they all went away in deferent directions. Then the bright light came twords my direction and then disappeared. This was about 3:30 PM.;40.0192;-82.3849
