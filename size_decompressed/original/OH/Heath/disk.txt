4 witnesses of a UFO;2012-09-06 20:37:00;2 minutes;4 witnesses of a UFO On the evening of 09/06/12 my wife, and 2 children witnessed a unidentified object in the sky. We had all gotten out of the vehicle and my oldest said look at that mommy.  All 4 of us were looking up into the eastern sky and were watching a ball of fire come out of the sky.  I said it looked like a ball of fire and must be space trash. I have seen it before. Well not this time.  As we are watching I see that it is slowing down.  I pull out my phone and start taking pictures.  In them you will see the ball of fire then you will see in later shots not a ball of fire but an object clear in the sky. The object as it was slowing down was still on fire. I could see it really well.  It finally came to a complete stop and was just sitting there burning and then the fire went out.  All I was able to see was the object there in the sky.  After 15 seconds of it sitting there it went from a dead stop to an extreme speed away from us going in a south eastern direction.   The total even lasted 2 minutes.;40.0192;-82.3849
