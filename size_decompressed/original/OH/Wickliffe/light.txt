Circular light pattern over Lake Erie flying straight up toward sky eventually disappearing;2012-08-19 20:30:00;3 minutes;Circular light pattern over Lake Erie flying straight up toward sky eventually disappearing Light shaped object hovered over Lake Erie and them flew upwards, eventually disappearing into the sky.  My wife and I could not figure out what it was.  It definitely was not a plane as those do not fly straight up. The only other thing it could have been was some sort of rocket, but that seems unusual coming out of the Cleveland/Lake Erie area. The only way I can describe it is as a sort of circular light pattern.  Very strange.... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
