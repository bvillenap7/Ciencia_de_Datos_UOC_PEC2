I was walking back towards the parking lot when i noticed and orange pulsating orb flying over.  It looked as tho it were really high up based on the size and comparing it to the space station which is viewable in the sky from my house right now. The object was moving in kind of a zigzag pattern, but would also come to a complete stop and then move again, the movement of it was like in spurts, it would slow down, come to a stop, then dash forward really quick. But to make it basic, it was an orange, pulsating, orb;39.3201999999996;-84.5520000000008
