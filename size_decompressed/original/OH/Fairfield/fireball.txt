Orange orbs rise and hover before disappearing.;2012-07-07 22:20:00;20 minutes;Orange orbs rise and hover before dissappearing. My wife and two children were sitting on our patio when I noticed a bright orange ball rising slowly over the tree line to the west.  It was around 10:20 p.m. and I knew right away it wasn't a plane because the orange color and no blinking lights.   We watched it rise high above the trees and then stop and hover for around a minute or two before dissappearing.  Not moved behind anything or faded away, it just dissappeared.   My wife and I were confused and had difficulty explaining it to my now uneasy daughter.   Suddenly another rose up into the sky and hovered.  My wife ran to get her cell phone camera but we couldn't get the orb in focus.  A third and final orange ball rose up just before the second one dissappeared.  It too rose, stopped and then dissappeared after hovering for a few minutes.  All in all the experience lasted fifteen minutes.  Neither of us had ever seen anything like this or know what they were.   We did an online search and found videos and similar s! tories and decided we better report this.
