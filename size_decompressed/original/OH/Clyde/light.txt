Two bright orange white lights flying in formation over Clyde Ohio;2009-07-03 21:45:00;4 minutes;Two bright orange white lights flying in formation over Clyde Ohio Me and my Family were sitting in the back of my pickup truck waiting for the fireworks display at the Clyde Reservoir in Clyde Ohio, there was still to much daylight for the show to begin, we were on the south side of the reservoir facing north at Hendricks park, and we were sitting under some power lines along Limerick rd. and Main Street (nearest intersection). Me and my wife noticed two bright orange/white light’s flying maybe a ½ mile apart from each other coming into our direction, which would have been my 1 o’ clock position, and going rather slow, and flying maybe just below cloud level, I didn’t see wings on them, and I could not hear the sounds of an airplane or helicopter, and there were as many as a few hundred people who were present around me awaiting the show, so I grabbed my binoculars from my truck and started tracking the front (nearest) UFO and it appeared to be glowing, and I was having trouble determining the shape because there were no distinctive wings, there were no strobe lights normally seen on aircraft, and no noise, I heard a man about 70 feet behind me say “what the heck is that ?” I didn’t respond, I followed the front UFO for just a minute, and I turned my focus to the rear UFO and just after I focused in, the Glow disappeared but I was still tracking it in the sky as a shadow, my wife was viewing with the naked eye and could no longer see it , and I told her that I had a lock on it, I told her at this point “ this is definitely not an airplane, it’s a UFO “ it was going rather slow, and appeared to be slightly inverted in the shadow, by my best estimation it was round in shape, as it came across my view flying south parallel to main street. (State Route 101) It was more over top of my view because I was now looking through power line wires and was getting a better reference as far as speed and how high it was , my best guess on speed was around 50 or 60 mph because of my vantage point following it between the power lines in my binoculars, it took some time to cross each line and then it started going into some clouds and it was becoming more difficult to follow and at this point, I went to look with my naked eye and I lost track of it. I’ve seen various air traffic around the area before and after this, all were distinguishable airplane traffic, these other two objects were something completely different, And I would not be surprised if someone snapped a picture of this given the number people waiting for the fireworks looking at the sky directly over Clyde Ohio. Clyde is about 80 miles southeast of Toledo and 30 Miles south of Sandusky Ohio. The time we saw this was 9:45 P.M. dusk, not quite dark enough for fireworks, the sky was mostly clear with a couple of spotty clouds, I lost view at about 9:49 P.M.;41.3020999999999;-82.9971000000001
