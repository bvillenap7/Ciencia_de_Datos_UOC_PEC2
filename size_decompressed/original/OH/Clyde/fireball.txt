2 fireballs following one another through the sky.;2009-07-03 21:45:00;10 minutes;2 fireballs following one another through the sky. July 3, 2009    21:45 pm-21:55 pm    As my children and I were waiting with friends for the Clyde fireworks to start several of us noticed something  unusual in the sky.  As we looked just south of where we were standing we saw two fireballs following one another in the night sky.   At first I did not believe what I was seeing, but there were 10-15 of us witnessing the same thing at the same time.  We are able to see both of these objects for approximately 6 minutes at which time only 1 remained visible.  They seemed to be moving west across the sky and straight up at the same time.   It was probably 20 minutes later that we were able to barely distinguish an orange glow still seeming to hover very, very high above us.;41.3020999999999;-82.9971000000001
