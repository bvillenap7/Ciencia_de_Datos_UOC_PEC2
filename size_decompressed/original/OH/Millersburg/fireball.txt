PD));2006-12-16 07:05:00;15 minutes;fireball left a glowing contrail as it went out and re- ignited Driving east from Mt. Vernon on rt.36 southwest of Danville, at approximately 1:00 on the lower 1/3 of the sky , I observed a glowing fireball the size of a streetlight. As it got brighter a 6 circle of the sky began to glow light blue as if in a haze. It expanded like a balloon then faded out.  Shockwave? The light then went out and re -ignited, then went out again leaving a zig zag contrail similiar to the challenger contrail. The contrail glowed in the morning dawn for 15 min. I thought, space junk, meteor, or a jet plane had exploded. It looked like a failed rocket launch on the horizon. I have seen no info yet but others driving east must have seen it. It was huge. No sound or shockwave felt. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Wallops Island, VA.  PD));40.5566999999998;-81.8323999999996
