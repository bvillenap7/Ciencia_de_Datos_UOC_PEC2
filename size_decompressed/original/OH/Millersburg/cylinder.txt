This is the second sighting that we have had of similar objects within a 2 week span.  This object had red, orange and blue lights flashing in sequence all around it, hovered in one place and the lights would go dim enough to appear invisible.  We went outside to view better, and approximately 5 minutes later, the object appeared to flash and shoot upwards, and it was gone.;40.5566999999998;-81.8323999999996
