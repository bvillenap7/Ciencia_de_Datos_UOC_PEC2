My friend and I are both students at Bowling Green State University.  Last night at about 1:30 am, we decided to take a study break and walk around outside.  After about 1 minute, we saw an object near the horizon.  It was a small circular white light that was traveling at a slow speed.  Since there is an airport nearby, we thought we were seeing the landing lights of an airplane.  However, the object slowed to a stop and then emitted a white flash and disappeared.  The flash was not very bright, but yet it seemed to cover the entire sky.  We estimated the object's distance to be about 2 or 3 miles.  We heard no sound.;41.3810915625001;-83.6553749999993
