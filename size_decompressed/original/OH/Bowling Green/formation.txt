Formation of twinkeling and moving amber lights seen at night.;2013-03-09 21:00:00;~1 minute+;Formation of twinkeling and moving amber lights seen at night. I was jogging tonight when I looked off to the west and noticed two bright, twinkeling, amber colored lights which apeared to be hovering in the distance. I cannot say how far away they were or what size they actually were but they became smaller and unvisible shortly after I noticed them. A few minutes later I looked off into the same spot in the sky I had first seen the two lights and then there were three of them in a triangular formation. They were amber colored and twinkeling as before. I saw the lowest one actually moving upwards while the others stayed at about the same altitude but seemed to be moving horizontally so these were not flares. The lower light appeared larger than the others.  As the two upper lights dissipated the lower light remained and then later dissapated as well until it could no longer be seen. I have seen many aircraft at night so am familiar with what helicopters and planes look like in the night sky and sometimes they do look rather strange if you see them at the correct angle with there lights on. I have also seen metorites streeking across the sky numerous times.  These lights I saw tonight were markedly different from anything I have actually witnessed. I did not hear any engine noises accompanying these lights but since I did not know how far away they were I cannot say for sure that they were not helicopter pilots playing games with bright lights. At this point this sighting is a mystery to me.;41.3810915625001;-83.6553749999993
