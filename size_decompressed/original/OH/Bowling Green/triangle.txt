I have never really believe in UFOs before, and I’m not even sure what I saw. This is what I can tell you:   At about 7:50 PM, my friend and I went outside to smoke a cigarette. We were looking at an unusually bright star, concluding that it was probably a planet. We were discussing what planet it might be when I looked above it and saw a flashing light. I thought it must have been an airplane, but when I looked a bit higher, I saw two more. What was very strange is that none of the blinking lights were moving. They were very far away, so I couldn’t tell for sure if they were just moving very slowly. Then, the highest one started to rise upwards, and we realize that it was coming towards us. We watched, and the weirdest part is that it was completely silent. There is a small-craft airport in town, and we are used to hearing planes. This object made no noise at all. It kept moving towards us until it was finally above us and then past us. We looked up and noticed that it was shaped like a triangle with a light blinking on each end, one light red. I thought they might be government planes since Palin was in Bowling Green today. But they were so close together that it just seemed off. The one traveling above us kept going, silently. We looked back to the other two- one was gone, the other (the lowest one, the first I saw) was still in the same spot. We kept watching the moving one and then the third reappeared (or a fourth appeared, I can’t be sure) coming from a completely new direction. They were less than an inch away (from where I stood, it looked this way), slowed down a bit, and then kept traveling on. We watched for 4-5 minutes. I went inside to turn on the news and fire up my computer, but of course nothing was mentioned. I have never looked up anything online about UFOs before, and this was the first site I came across. I went back outside about 3 minutes after I stopped watching- the first object that I saw was gone, the one that moved over us was very far into the distance, and the third was also gone. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I am correcting the date on my previously submitted form- I wrote that it was the 30th when it is, in fact, the 29th. ((END ADDENDUM));41.3810915625001;-83.6553749999993
Giant white triangular UFO hovers over me for a 3 seconds then shoots off into the sky.;2012-08-16 02:00:00;5 seconds;Giant white triangular UFO hovers over me for a 3 seconds then shoots off into the sky. Stargazing is a ritualistic form of stress relief.  This night turned out to be different. I noticed there was much activity in the sky after I had already seen three shooting stars and two flashes of light. I dozed off after a 15 hour shift at work outside on back porch.  As soon as I opened my eyes upon awaking, I was surprised to see an aircraft not to high from me that contained a total of 3 giant white lights in triangular form.  The aircraft hovered until it was right above me, stopped, then picked up speed until it zoomed away so fast as my eyes followed it in awe.

Three reddish or amber lights in form of triangle investigating Bowling Green, Ohio's fireworks display.;2013-07-03 22:16:00;1 minute;Three reddish or amber lights in form of triangle investigating Bowling Green, Ohio's fireworks display. Nearing the end of the city’s fireworks display in Bowling Green, Ohio, at 10:16 PM on July 3, 2013, four of us saw three red lights in the formation of a triangle. I say reddish lights, husband says amber. Our guesstimation is that it was about 600 ft from the ground and about 300 ft across from the widest two lighted points of the triangle with a light at the center. We did not hear any noise emitting from this large sized craft. It was coming from the South and headed kind of North.  As we watched for about one minute, it appeared to turn to the East towards the BGSU Stadium where the fireworks were being dispatched. When it turned we no longer could see the other two lights to the left but only the one which had been on the right of the triangle viewing head on. The one amber light was fading fast and then we didn’t see it any longer. My daughter’s fiancée was not a believer of UFO’s, but now with the hair rising on his arms at this sight, he believes.;41.3810915625001;-83.6553749999993
