Large red object seen over northern ohio sept. 3rd around 11 pm;2012-08-03 22:55:00;1-2 minutes;Large red object seen over northern ohio sept. 3rd around 11 pm Around 10:55 pm, sitting on my roof top porch, I noticed an extremely bright and large red/ yellow orange circle that was soaring through the sky, I was facing west, the object moved from the south east to the north west. I was able to capture a 19 second video of the object however the size and color are not visible.  You can however see the object much brighter than the stars in the background as it moves from left to right.  The object seemed to be moving away from me and increasing altitude. If a star was 1 unit in diameter this was 10-20 units in diameter.  Not sure of the distance away it was, but appeared to be in our atmosphere.;41.3810915625001;-83.6553749999993
