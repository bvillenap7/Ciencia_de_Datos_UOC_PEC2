Sphere that emitted blue & red flashes & disapered without a trace.;2001-01-25 21:30:00;about 3 minuets;Sphere that emitted blue & red flashes & disapered without a trace. I was looking out my kitchen window{it faces East}, when I saw slightly to the North East a sphere that was flashing{quickly flashing} blue & then red.  The flashes were 3 blue to 4 red.  The sphere was moving slightly North, but then returned to the spot I saw it at, then it disappeared.   There wasn't any white lights like you'd see with either a helocopter or an airplane.   I then went to my back door{which also faces East} and I couldn't see the sphere.  I returned to the kitchen window & there it was again.  The blue & red flashing wasn't as intense, but it was still flahing.  I saw a small aircraft flying lower & South of the sphere, but headed in an Easterly direction.  I looked back at the sphere & noticed it wasn't flashing, but there was a blue & red light, then it disapeared again.   I haven't seen it since.   The sphere appeared to be large{it was slightly over my neighbors garage...from my angle/visual prospective}. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the star, Sirius.  PD));40.2860999999998;-84.1729000000003
Spotting of 8 clusters of 3 red/orange fire orbs flying over Sidney Ohio ( Took Pictures);2013-08-28 21:00:00;20 minutes;Spotting of 8 clusters of 3 red/orange fire orbs flying over Sidney Ohio ( Took Pictures) On August 28th of 2013, outside my windows of my front room, I noticed a rather tight triangle formation of 3 red lights in the east.  I have been to dozens of airshows so it was an unusual formation to see late at night.  It was a tight triangle formation of aircraft. NOTE: Going to air shows does not make me an expert.  However, it was unusual enough for me to notice that they were in a tight formation at night with absolutely no blinker lights.  In the daytime, a tight triangle formation is dangerous.  I have to believe that the danger level would be elevated 100x at night. So, I went outside to see what type of airplane was flying overhead, but I did not hear a sound.  The clouds were low, no stars were present, and the wind was blowing in a NE direction about 10 mph (gusts up to 22 according to my cell phone.)  I sat and watched the triangle formation of lights flatten out and become a string when the first light began to fade out.  My first guess is that this object went behind a cloud.  At least, that is what my mind told me.  However, the next two lights also began to fade out but at different spots in the sky. So I thought that was weird! and was about to head back into the house when I looked back to the east, I saw more of these red dots in the sky.  They were always in clusters of three but I saw more clusters now.  Not just a single cluster of 3 red/orange lights. They all were traveling East to Northwest.  Given that these objects were going against the prevailing wind, I am confident in saying that they were not Chinese Lanterns.  Furthermore, on average, it would take about 2 minutes for these lights to go from the horizon to overhead to out of sight.  So they were not wasting any time. I was actually able to go into the house in order to grab my camera, tri-pod and my binoculars.  However, in my excitement, the pictures that I took are not the best. When I viewed the objects thru my binoculars, they appeared to be red rings.  When the event was over, I counted at least 24 objects in the sky (Or 8 clusters of 3).  All of which were completely quite.  This viewing lasted about 20 minutes.;40.2860999999998;-84.1729000000003
