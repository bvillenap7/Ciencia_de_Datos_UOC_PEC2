diamond /cylinder shaped craft witnessed by three and made belivers for life.;2002-08-02 03:23:00;20 mins;diamond /cylinder shaped craft witnessed by three and made belivers for life. it was during the summer and we were sleeping outside in my suv for the night we were having problems in the house . so me and my best friend decided to go sleep in the car , well we do remeber falling asleep at about 2 am , and at approximately 3:23 am , me and her both sat straight up out of a sleep didnt say anything but looked at the radio for the reception was coming in and out and the lights were dimming on the inside of the car and i got this weird metallic taste in my mouth and immediately after looked straight out the front windshield and up into the sky and there about 30 feet above us was a craft the size of a 747 jetliner , in the shape of almost a football with a more diamond shape a weird glowing silver metallic color and green very bright lights surrounding the whole craft , now we both then freaked out and drove to my mothers house , the craft followed us the whole time , omitting a very weird humming noise , there were no jets , no propellers of any kind , it never changed height just kept up with my speed whilei was driving , now we got to my mothers house and as we ran inside it followed us and hovered slightly behind but still above the house , thats when my mother saw it and we watched it go up and then poof it was just gone , no sight of it , for weeks we felt very weird , wondering to ourselves why we just woke up at the same time , no need to wake one another , were we abducted and at that moment put back in the car and brought to awareness , or were we sent a signal of some kind , and if none of the above , we wonder how long was it really there ? many questions still are unanswered about the event , i wasnt a beliver till this happened and i am a very practical person , if i didnt have witnesses i might have thought it was all a dream , but sure enough it was very real .
