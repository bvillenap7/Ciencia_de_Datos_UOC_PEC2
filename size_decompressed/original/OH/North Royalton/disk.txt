I was 13 years old in 1973 when this happened,but remember it like was yesterday.Mom sent me to get five year old sister at the nieghbors.We lived in out of the way development wiyh no street lights.Full moon was rising in the east,I noticed a bright light at 5 o'clock to the moon,thought it was Venus.It suddenly moved to 3 oclock position then stopped.It then moved to a 12 o'clock position and stopped again.It then started coming towards us in a straight line.As it moved closer the light got smaller and smaller.The high school principal wive came out the house at this time,then I noticed the kids,who were all 4 and 5 year olds,stopped playing and were looking up at this thing.itwas eerily quiet.I made out three windows with occupants.They had large oblong heads,that looked too big for their skinny necks.They appeared to be leaning on something,and their long skinny arms were crossing each others.Their torsos were also long and thin.As it was directly overhead,the light turned into a pinprick,then it passed over,and could not be seen anymore!I asked the lady ,what was that?,she said nothing and went back inside.We both knew what it was.I should also mention that the inside backround of the craft reminded me of the color of a brown out if you ever seen that before,and it was moving east to west;41.3197;-81.7538000000003
