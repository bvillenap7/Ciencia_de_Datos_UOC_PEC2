We saw a light very far off in the distance stop.  For a few seconds.  Then it started slowly approaching. The craft was very low and nearly silent. There were two extremely bright lights.  As it came closer we saw a blinking light in the center or the two bright lights.  We couldn't see the body at first because of the lights.  As it flew over us the lights were pointing forward and we got a better look at the body.  the front part of the body was almost triangualar shaped.  The wings were triangualarly shaped and the tail was very short and had 3 lights on the bottom. ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));41.3197;-81.7538000000003
Triangular craft seen in Northern Ohio;2006-06-14 18:00:00;2 minutes;Triangular craft seen in Northern Ohio Between 2006 and 2008 I was living in North Royalton, Ohio (44133). I had an apartment on the 3rd floor with a balcony that faced to the East. It was Summer time and after 9:00pm. I had been sitting on my couch watching TV when my show ended. I decided to step onto the porch for a while as it was quiet outside and peaceful. I stepped out to the railing. On the other side of the apartment complex were large trees. Coming over the tops of those trees was some kind of a craft. I kick myself now for not having a camera handy. It made no sound. It was triangular in shape and had 3 lights on its bottom side. I would guess that it was 60 to 80 feet across. It came from East-Southeast, over the tree tops and apartments at the other end of the complex straight towards me. It could not have been more than 100 feet over the top of the roof of my apartment as it passed over. Never a sound and not disrupting my TV or lights inside. I had drawn a sketch of what I had seen that night and kept it put away for a long time. In 2008 I was laid off from a manufacturing job in Strongsville, Ohio. At that time I decided to go to school and take Graphic Design (something I had always wanted to do, but had not the time). I later found my drawing in a dresser drawer and used it to create a better image using Adobe Photoshop. Today is Sunday, December 11, 2011. I am still unemployed and currently living with my mother and step-father in Cleveland (Middleburg Hts), Ohio. At 6:15pm tonight I had another sighting that I could not explain. There were 6 craft in all. 4 in a formation moving to the West. 2 others that crossed each otherâ€™s path and moved away from each other with blinking lights that went on-and-off at exactly the same time. I yelled back inside to my mother to come outside. I showed her the 2 lights (the other 4 were already gone). I explained how they were blinking in unison and to watch them for a moment. She did and could not explain it. They were not planes. We are near Cleveland Hopkins Airport and see planes every day. We could only see the lights and no details of the craft themselves.;41.3197;-81.7538000000003
Triangle-shaped UFO, hovering with red and white lights.;2014-09-04 21:30:00;3 minutes;Triangle-shaped UFO, hovering with red and white lights. We saw a triangle shaped craft, with white lights along both sides and red lights along the back of the craft.  The lights were not blinking.   It hovered for several seconds above some tall trees before heading north towards Cleveland.   There was no sound heard.   We contacted the local Police and they had no other calls regarding this craft.   I am confused as to whether it was some type of drone or a UFO?  It was exciting either way !;41.3197;-81.7538000000003
