Several UFOs reported in southwest Ohio over several days and this may be another sighting.;2003-10-15 19:25:00;10 minutes;Several UFOs reported in southwest Ohio over several days and this may be another sighting. My wife and I were taking route 73 to Oxford, Ohio last night around 6:30 - 7:45 PM from Centerville, Ohio. Around 7:25 PM as we were aproaching Oxford on route 73 I saw a very bright light to the right of a radio tower to our north. I thought to myself I bet someone might think that light to be a UFO, but I bet it's some plane's landing lights. It remained fairly stationary, which I thought odd. About 5 minutes later the lights faded and the seperation of the object and the radio tower (about 5 miles away) got smaller and the lights got much dimmer. The object was so far away that all I could see was the brightness of the light - I looked for blinking wing lights, but the bright light overpowered them (if it was an airplane). This occured about 1/2 of the way between Collinsville and Oxford. I didn't have any binocculars with me to get a decent view of the object. At home when I have seen landing lights as bright as the light I saw on 10/15, I can easily see two landing lights close together without binoculars. I am reporting this because I saw there was a report of a UFO in Trenton, Ohio 2 days before and on another site a UFO was seen in nearby Middletown, Ohio on 10/15.  (If you have a copy of DeLorme's Ohio Atlas & Gazetteer, this took place near the bottom of page 64 along highway 73 just outside of Collinsville heading west towards Oxford, Ohio, before and after highway 177 crosses highway 73. The radio tower is about 5 miles north - near the intersection of Camden-Darrtown Rd. and Camden-College Corner Rd.);39.5153;-84.6094
