The craft was absolutely silent, and by judging distance, appeared to be moving at a good rate of speed. What I saw was what started out as a red dot in the sky.  As it moved closer from the north, I began to see what appeared to be red and orange revolving lights.  The object appeared to be no more than 1000 ft. from the ground hovering absolutely silent.  Though I cannot give an exact shape of the object, it did not appear to be saucer shaped.  It seemed to be more boxy or triangular shaped.  I watched the object for about 1 to 2 minutes until, well frankly, I became scared shitless.  I ran into the house to wake my mother so she could see the object, but by the time we got outside it had gone.  I said nothing about this to anyone outside of my family until Thursday night at work.  When I did talk about it at work, expecting to get laughed at, I found an older man who claims to have seen an object similar in description.  He saw it on his way home from work on the same night between 11:00 and 11:30 pm.  His sighting was about 10 miles WSW of mine, though he watched for about ! 20 minutes.;40.9447;-84.2361
