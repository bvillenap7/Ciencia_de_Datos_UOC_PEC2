An orange red cylinder flying to the North.;2014-10-01 21:55:00;3 minutes;An orange red cylinder flying to the North. I saw an orange light approaching from the South, traveling North for approximately 3 miles.  It was not a helicopter or a plane.  I lost sight of it as it passed directly over my car.  It was approximately 1,000 feet in the air, and maybe 10 to 20 feet wide.  There were no wings.  The shape was somewhat like an upright cylinder with half a semi-circle on either side.;40.9447;-84.2361
