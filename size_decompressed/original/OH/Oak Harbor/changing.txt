Red light hovering in western sky with flashing light object next to it moving both disappeared abruptly;2013-08-03 22:00:00;10 minutes;red light hovering in western sky with flashing light object next to it moving both disappeared abruptly i was staying at my aunt's  farm house alone taking care of her animals, at about 930pm the dogs started barking, so i went outside to see what was bothering them, the horses were upset too.  I noticed that someone was setting off fireworks about ten miles away, and figured that was the issue, as i watched the fireworks i noticed two bright objects above the trees in the distance one was hovering and one was moving and changing color, they appeared too bright to be aircraft and were silent, i watched them for a while and decided one must be a radio tower, although it was a brighter red light and i hadn't recalled seeing a tower there, by now the color changing object was gone, but the red light remained hovering, i went inside to get binoculars, when i returned less than a minute later it was gone;41.5265;-83.1353
