It had not normal green and red softly pulsing light(s), thought was airplane at first but appeared hovering motionless and soundless for several mins... then very instantly and effortlessly fast traveled south-southwest and continued until disappeared in a cloud seemingly couple miles away!  It reappeared after several mins apparently making a big loop and back to its original spot where it’s lights turned to pulsing white and red...  For about a minute. It then speed straight north-northeast?  Across sky and was gone... interestingly its flight course correlates to loc of beryllium plant down river and northeast is nuclear plant, very strange... wife thought it was a drone... but if it was it was, it would have been navigated over huge 5 plus mile area and was well out of visual sight range several times for several mins...? Not t! o mention battery life considerations and an altitude that would be very illegal for a drone... town People had to see it cause they were all out waiting for fireworks show to start by portage river. If it was a drone it was not civilian, and had incredible capabilities.  I worked on military a/c and I don’t know what it was? Spent another hour scanning sky but it never returned.;41.5265;-83.1353
