They looked like they belonged to one very large, triangular aircraft at first, flying too low and coming from the wrong direction.  But there is a local airport, so I know very well what low-flying planes look and sound like.  The lights then started to move west again, farther away from me, and I could see that they were moving separately.   Their flight was quite low, and as I watched them move farther away to the west they started to fade and then disappeared altogether. Then, around 10:40 p.m. EST, I saw another, singula,r orange light come from the southwest direction.  It flew more slowly than the previous two, but seemed to follow their trajectory. Just as before, as I watched it fly farther west before it faded and then seemed to disappear.;39.8894;-84.1974
