triangler figure in Vandalia, OH;2009-09-04 05:30:00;1 minute;triangler figure in Vandalia, OH I got up, ready for school, I sat in the window with my dog. I looked up in the sky and saw a triangler figure. My eyes were wide open. So I ran right to the door. As soon as I was on the front porch, my mouth dropped. It had a white light circle in the middle and on the sides were colored lights that were red, white, and blue. It traveled from the north east to the south west. The next day I saw a very large helicopter following the same path. Passing the house about six times.;39.8894;-84.1974
