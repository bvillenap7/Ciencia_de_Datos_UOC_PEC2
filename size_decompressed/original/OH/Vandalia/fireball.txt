We thought it was a plane with an engine on fire since we are airport police officers at the Dayton International Airport. The object broke into several smaller white pieces travelling in a straight line approx. west to east.These smaller objects then changed color to a glowing red similar to charcoal embers. The object appeared to be right over the airport. I turned on the ground control radio to listen for any radio traffic about it. We saw the object and thought a plane was in trouble at the airport. We realized it was not a plane but thought it might be a meteor since a shower was expected later that night and the following night. I believe the object fell apart over the airport. The object appeared to be directly over the airport and was travelling at a rather slow speed. A few minutes later someone from Fayette County Emergency Communications Center called our dispatch office and asked if we had a plane go down. They had received several calls about the object. ((NUFORC Note--We believe the witness describes the event of 16NO99.  We have changed the date here.));39.8894;-84.1974
