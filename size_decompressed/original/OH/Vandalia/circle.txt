Bright white light traveling very slowly at high altitude from north to south.  Directly over head.   My wife was walking our dog and I was taking out the trash when she pointed directly upward, bringing my attention to a bright light.  The light dipped down toward us, getting bigger in size.   Then, suddenly, and very quickly, it headed out into space.  My wife and I are both armature ((amateur??)) astronomers and are very familiar with all known aircraft and satellites.    We're out looking at the sky every clear night.   The size appeared huge, particularly when it dipped down toward us.   It was shocking to see it head outward into space.;39.8894;-84.1974
