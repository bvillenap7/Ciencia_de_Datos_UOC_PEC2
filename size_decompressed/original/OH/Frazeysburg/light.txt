Lights getting brighter and brighter then dimmer then disappeared.;2019-08-28 20:40:00;15 minutes;Lights getting brighter and brighter then dimmer then disappeared. I was outside at night and focused on a star.  It seemed to be getting brighter and brighter without actually moving.  It seemed like it was getting closer.  It was yellow/orange and it was getting really intense.   At that moment I saw something out of the corner of my eye and when I looked it was another star/light with the same coloring and the same intensity.  As I shifted back to see the other, it was very apparent that It was dimming a bit and then it just flew off quickly.   At this time there were other planes that were active and by comparison the light was way faster.  I was very confused and then I focused on the other bright light.  This light got brighter then dimmer and much like the last light flew away quickly.  None of these lights crossed paths.;40.1337;-82.1266
