A circular white light that changes from red to blue to green in a circular motion as a strobe light in the SW part of the sky.;2001-07-13 22:00:00;1 hour;A circular white light that changes from red to blue to green in a circular motion as a strobe light in the SW part of the sky. This has appeared for many evenings and it begins as a white starlike appearance in the SW part of the sky and it is always there during a full moon.  Red, blue, green lights are seen going in a circle fast like a strobe light.  It gets very bright and the dull.  The first evening it was to the SE, then the next two evening it was to the SW.  It becomes most evident around 22:00 and lasts for approximately 2-3 hours.  The first night we saw this thing in the sky and stopped at a gas station to view it with about 3 other people,  after a 5 minute period we saw a red light come off the right part of the thing and fly very fast downwards then around the aircraft then disapear.  If you blinked you would have missed most of it.  We have video taped this and you can see the lights changing colors from red to blue to green.  It will go towards the ground then go back up almost as if it were a yo-yo.  On July 13 approximately 23:00 hours headed west on rt 30 I yelled to my husband what was that orange thing that almost hit the cat and then swooped beside it  he replied in a shaky voice I don't know did you see the blace thing in front of it as if they were in a playful chase?  My aircraft was like a flying stingray fish with large holes in the wings and a color burnt orange then there was a huge white circle in the trees.  I looked behind us to see if the truck behind us was causing the light and they were not for they had stopped in the middle of the road and got out pointing and looking.  They saw the same thing we did. ((NUFORC Note:  Except for the motion reported by the witnesses, we ordinarily would suspect that a celestial body had given rise to the report, probably Mars, which moves across the southern sky over the course of the evening.
