A;1973-09-30 22:30:00;1 minute;Driving on a back road in rural Wayne county, we had been driving along a stretch of woodland when we entered some cleared farmland.  As we passed this area, a harvested hay field we saw 5 or 6 small craft sitting in the field at the back of the clearing near the woods.  They were approximatly 500 or 600 feet from the road.  About the size of a volkswagon bug with a red light at each corner of a triangle.  As we passed thru the area they each rose from the field and flew over the field and the road behind us.  I saw nothing else as I was busy getting the hell out of there.  My friend and I told no-one at the time even though there had been articles in The Daily Record, the local paper discribing a much larger triagular craft being seen around the county.  I've always wondered if the several smaller craft assembled into the larger one.  Wayne county had several sightings of a large trianglar craft again in 1975.  Many saw it, myself included.  Many years later I read the book about the Hudson Valley sightings and it was identical to the craft I and another friend saw in 1975.  The local paper covered both sightings very well, giving them front page exposure.;40.8141999999999;-81.9386999999999
