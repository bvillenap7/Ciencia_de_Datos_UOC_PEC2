A few seconds later, another intense RED light appeared right behind the first one, and disappeared behind the same cloud.  A few seconds later, another intense light, this one farther north, and farther away, appeared for a few seconds, and disappeared.  A few seconds later, almost directly overhead, ANOTHER INTENSE red light appeared, motionless, for a few seconds, then disappeared.  These lights continued to appear and disappear for 3 to 5 minutes, randomly, all over the sky, and I lost count of them after 10.  They made no noise, and only a couple of them appeared to move.  There WAS a jet airliner flying southwest in the vacinity, so I was able to get some perspective of altitude, speed, and color, but the airliner appeared oblivious to the lights.;40.8141999999999;-81.9386999999999
