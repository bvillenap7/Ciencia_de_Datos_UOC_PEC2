Large, diamond-shaped object in Wayne County Ohio;2004-11-03 21:30:00;5 minutes;Large, diamond-shaped object in Wayne County Ohio On the evening of Nov. 3,  I pulled into my driveway after viewing very bright lights in the sky, almost following me down the road at a distance that was several hundred feet, not several thousand as would most commercial planes be traveling. I called me spouse outside in time for both of us to watch as this VERY LARGE, diamond-shaped craft approached and traveled directly over our house. It moved slowly with almost no sound. A low hum could be heard, although were you inside a house or doing anything outside that made even a slight bit of noise, you would not have heard the hum. The object had a red light in the middle of it's massive belly that slowly blinked on and off. Looking directly up at it, a blue-green light on the left tip, a white light on the right tip and white light on the top or front tip. The back tip of the diamond was also a red light, though fainter and not blinking. It was an awesome sight, this huge, silent diamond slowly going over our heads. We have not seen it since, though we have seen very bright, red and white lights that hover, then move, then hover some more within one mile from our house. Another witness also saw the red and white lights and feels it was definitely triangular-shaped, possible diamond-shaped, and when he attempted to follow the lights they would move about.;40.8141999999999;-81.9386999999999
