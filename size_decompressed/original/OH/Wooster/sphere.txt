In 1973 and 74 there were many sightings in this area of strange things in the sky.  On this particular evening I witnessed a red ball hovering above the ground off to the east.  It was slowly moving around, drifting to the south and then to the north.  I was wondering how I could get it to come closer.  Believe it or not, I decided to go in the house and get my shotgun, thinking that the bright flash and loud noise of a shotgun discharging at night might attract it attention.  Well, I shot off a round, and the object started drifting closer!  It kept coming closer until I lost sight of it behind some trees in the cow pasture behind our house (we lived in a rural area north of Wooster).  Trying to locate the object, I stepped over the electric fence that bordered our propery and stood in the pasture looking around.  The object then drifted out from behind the trees and past by me, no more than 20 yards away from me and only about 10 feet off the ground.  It is hard to explain what it looked like, and it was 26 years ago, but I'll do the best that I can.  It was about 12 feet in diameter, a perfect sphere.  It's surface was completely covered with 'half-spheres', or domes.  Kind of a popcorn ball effect. The domes were different colors, red, blue, and green.  What I remember the most is how perfect those colors were.  They were just so pure.  The sphere did not make a sound.  It drifted by me, and then angled up to go over the telephone and electric lines that ran down the road to the west of our propery.  It slowly disappered as it drifted to the west.   I've always wondered if anyone else has ever seen anything like this.;40.8141999999999;-81.9386999999999

Sighting began as a spherical object moving N/NW outside of known flight paths, object was flying low, brightly lit with a circumnavigating red light through the center, there was no sound observed, object followed a straight bearing for approx. 2 minutes then stopped, gained several hundred feet in altitude (Assumed amount of altitude gain, was +/- 10 vertical degrees at an unknown distance) object quickly changed colors from white to red, red to blue, blue back to white.  Observed object for 27 minutes before it appeared to descend out of visual range, during the duration of observation no audible sounds came from the object.;40.8141999999999;-81.9386999999999
