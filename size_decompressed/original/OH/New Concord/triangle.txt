The lights were bigger than normal aircraft lights and it was flying in an unusual part of the sky for normal aircraft.  The craft seemed to be hovering and was moving southeast to northwest and then shortly after I noticed it the craft turned and started moving east to west.   The craft was rotating on its x axis and in the time span I viewed it the craft's original front was facing backwards.  Although there were no reference objects the craft seemed to be flying fairly low though and judging from my perception of the crafts height it's size, I would guess, was about the size of a shopping center parking lot.  However, high it was it appeared to be larger than my house which is 20x40'.;40.0057;-81.7402
