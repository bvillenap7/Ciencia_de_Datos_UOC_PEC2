I looked up at the sky and a light was moving in the southeast direction of Marietta.  My mother and a friend saw it at the same time.  As we were watching, it suddenly shifted to the left at a right angle from its original direction.  It then continued to move in its original southeast direction.  As we watched, it did another lightning-fast right-angle shift to the left and then continued to the southeast.  Shortly after this, it disappeared.  All that was visible the entire time was a light.;39.5382;-81.5204
