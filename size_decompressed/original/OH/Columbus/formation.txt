Formation of lights, arranged in the pattern of an arrow symbol or christmas tree.  Hovered, moved, and hovered again.  Afterwards,;1998-06-14 04:30:00;3 mins.;Formation of lights, arranged in the pattern of an arrow symbol or christmas tree.  Hovered, moved, and hovered again.  Afterwards, a bright glowing object moved from my right to left, jitterd and dissapeared. I was inside my apartment, looking outside the window that faces south over the city of Columbus.  It was about 4:30 AM.  I was watching the stars and the moon.  I looked up about 75 degrees, and I saw a formation of lights.  The lights were not a brilliant in their luminicity, and I assumed that it was rather high in the atmosphere.  When I first saw it, I thought the stars were moving...impossible...then I realized what I was seeing.  It looked like a large arrow in the sky, and it moved about one foot across my field of view, then it hovered and just stayed there.  To demonstrate what it was, make an equalateral triangle with a 6 dot pattern...then attach a smaller square, using 5 dots.  There should be a total of 11 dots.  (I don't remember exactly how many lights there were)  I assumed I was seeing many craft, but now wonder if it may have been one craft with many lights.  I wastched it for about 20 seconds, just hovering in the sky (it pointed upwards at an angle of 45 degrees.)  I walked away from the window, amazed, and went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror.  I came back, and the lights were gone.  Off to my right, there was a bright light.  I didn't hear any noises and it seemed to move quite quickly across the sky, at about 1 foot per second.  I expected for it to go off into the horizon, but it did not.  There was a tree near my window, just off to my left.  It flew between two branches and slowed down.  Then it moved upwards quite eradically and blinked out.  I think this was all meant for me to see for some reason.  There is more to tell, about myself actually...and it leads to conclude that I may be a subject of theirs.  I would like very much to be contacted about this.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Formation of five points of lights in daylight, hovering and changing foramtion, comparable to satalites in brightness, rising up until;2003-08-30 14:00:00;15 minutes;Formation of five points of lights in daylight, hovering and changing foramtion, comparable to satalites in brightness, rising up until Kreiger Ford sponsered Mustang club of Ohio show. Perfect sky, no clouds anywhere. While enjoying the day we looked up into the colbalt blue of the overhead sky and saw a tight Y formation of four silver dots, each about the size of a pinhead seen from a foot or so away. First thought was they were mylar ballons, but the perfect formation, then the change to a V made us wonder. They were not moving much, like you would expect from a formation of planes, from their position, but hovering. Then 2 of the dots started moving in slow broad circles around the others. After this, they started to split up, slowly, and seemed to go higher and less distinct. Again, we kept thinking childs ballons, but then a commercial jet when by, quite high up so the jet looked the size of a fly from about a foot away, and the dots were temporarly blocked by it as it passed. Within a few minutes of this, a smaller fast jet, possibly fighter, went past from west to east, and the objects then faded from view. If it were night, if they were going left to right or some similar course, I would compare the size an luminisity to a satalite, even in the daylight, but their movement was not linear, but as described above, hovering and making un-satalite type moves.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Formation of 6 to 7 objects in Columbus, Ohio;2006-04-15 16:00:00;5 minutes;Formation of 6 to 7 objects in Columbus, Ohio 3/25/07  On a Monday, around 4:30-5:00pm, I believe early April of last year, I witnessed, I'm sure of multiple UFO's.  I was at Como Park on top of a very large mound that the kids sled off of in the winter, and ride bikes down in the spring, and locals sunbathe on top of it.  Anyway, my family and I decided to take a walk at the park that day, and I noticed how things seemed to be illuminated.  I don't know expactly how to explain it but I'll try...Flowers seemed brighter, more vivid, I told my boyfriend how absolutely beautiful it was and how great I was feeling, which is unusual, I usually hurt when I've been walking for a while.  Anyway, towards the end of the walk, on our way out of the park, we stopped to relax and fly a kite on the mound. I laid down on the grass, at the top of the mound, wearing my sun glasses, and started looking around, just taking it all in (again this day was different somehow illuminated), and noticed kind of an aura above the trees that line the park.  I'm commenting to my boyfriend all the beauty that I am taking special notice of, and laying on my back I look straight ahead and a little to the left and I notice what at first glance I thought to be birds darting back and forth at each other.  I did'nt think much of it for a few seconds, until a hawk or some kind of bird flew in between my sight of the other whiteish objects.  So I know what I was looking at was very very far away, and thought that birds don't usually, that Im aware of dart aggressively towards one another. Upon focusing on the objects, I noticed one central one towards the top of the almost formation.  There may have been five or six others, I could'nt count them, they were moving too quickly, almost like in training, the top one did'nt do much, but the ones underneath seemed to be following orders or something. They changed from looking white, to opaque when they sped up. I even lost track of them for a few seconds even though there were no clouds in the way, maybe they were moving so fast I could'nt see them. The whole time I'm witnessing this, I'm yelling for my boyfriend to lay next to me to see what I'm seeing, he laughs at me and contiues to fly his kite.  He missed out on a once in a lifetime experience.  I was afraid to take my eyes off the area, afraid I would lose sight of them.  Finally I got my son to lay down and he got to see just as they started to disappear.  I told my boyfriend that if I saw them then someone else had to see them too.  I told him I bet the government knows their there, and I told him that I bet a jet or some type of aircraft will go to that area, and I pointed the area out to him, and maybe within a few minutes, a jet went right past that very area I pointed out.  I believe, that is the other reason my boyfriend believes me, because the jet was probably sent by the government, and he know's I would never make up a story like that, and he knows I don't lie.

I thought It was a flock of geese, as it was coming closer I seen a reflection of the sun bouning off them and didn't see no wings on the birds. At, that time I moved off the chair  and moved about 10 feet closer and looked above again and seen it for about 10 more seconds and then they just vanished. I was told that some  other people from the North end of town seen the same thing I did and they also thought it was a flock of birds and they seen it vanish too.And there was no noise or sound at all. I was scared to death and very shaking afterwards.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Four orange/red lights in changing formation viewed from the Short North;2012-10-07 21:05:00;2 minutes;Four orange/red lights in changing formation viewed from the Short North This evening I witnessed something out of the ordinary:  I came out of my back door and saw four bright orange-red objects in the sky, moving from the west to the east.  One was clearly in the lead, the other three lights moved behind at some distance. They appeared to be moving directly over the flight path for the Columbus (CMH) airport's approach, however, they stayed at the same height.  As the moved across the sky, the three that trailed the leader moved in different formations.  At first they had no distinct pattern.  Then they drifted to align in a straght line eventually forming a near perfect triangle. Winds were from the west at 5 miles per hour, these were traversing the sky at a much faster rate - totally silent, not quite the speed of the many jets I see and hear taking off and landing each day. The lights did not flash or flicker, akin to the &quotchinese lantern&quot effect I've seen described in other reports.  Quite bright, as if drifting across the sky (except for the various formations of the trailing three) until they faded into a hazy cloud layer. I called the police, the dispatcher had no other reports of the sighting roughly ten minutes later.  The lights left no trail but were very unique. I'm a fairly sane individual who enjoys watching the skies for meteors and space station sightings and can name several of the galaxies formations and objects upon sight.  This was unlike any of those.  They did not reflect, but produced their own light in a shade similar to sodium street lights with a bit more red, somewhat pinkish tint. Within a few minutes, I could hear a jet approaching the airport. It was a quiet evening for this part of town.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Three red lights in consistent formation, occasionally vanishing, and re-appearing.;2012-11-13 20:30:00;few minutes;Three red lights in consistent formation, occasionally vanishing, and re-appearing. Three glowing red objects in consistent formation.  Objects were slow moving, going in and out of a triangle formation, but light never flickered or flashed like a helicopter, or aircraft.   At first, one vanished while the other two remained.   Then the second vanished as well.   The third lingered for a few minutes afterwards, flying in a lateral movement, frequently stopping in place.   Visibility of the object went in and out for about a minute or so, and then the object finally disappeared.

UFOs in formation both stationary and moving, over columbus ohio 8:45 pm.;2014-07-04 20:45:00;15 minutes;ufos in formation both stationary and moving, over columbus ohio 8:45 pm We were lying on a sleeping bag with a tarp under it waiting for clintonville (metro columbus fireworks. 8:35pm. still daylight.  we had very good binoculars with us. one object appeared, round, high up, very obviously not an airplane. we watched it through binocs it changed color and moved slowly aross the sky NW to SE perhaps 15 degrees then returned and was stationary. we would estimate this object to have been at 8000-9000 feet. it continued to change color red blue yellow.  then three more identical ones appeared just southeast of where the stationary one was, and the three were in a perfect triangular formation. identical in size and shape to the first one, and changing color.  very obviously a formation. we watched this through binoculars for at least two-three minutes. then all four moved southeast, the three staying in formation and the first one off behind. they then moved to a higher altitude and were no longer visible.  a number of people saw this.  we dont know if anyone else watched it through binoculars. one of us is an MD one of us owns a financial advisory company.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

I couldn't take my eyes off of it, it was almost like a trail of glowing blue lights, just moving a crossed the sky.  It was way to high up to be an airplane or a satellite.
