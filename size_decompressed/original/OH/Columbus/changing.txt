This was witnessed by myself and my husband.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
White-blue lights over Columbus, Ohio;2008-10-22 00:45:00;3-5 min;White-blue lights over Columbus, Ohio The light started as a single white-blue light then it moved into a V shaped formation after which it seemed to brake apart into smaller independent objects that seemed to stay at the same altitude as it moved from north to south in the sky then the lights moved back toghter and  disappeared into the night sky.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Three red-lighted objects forming a triangle shape in the sky moves around and then disappears!;2013-05-13 23:00:00;15 minutes;Three red-lighted objects forming a triangle shape in the sky moves around and then disappears! We saw three red lights in the sky, we thought it was a new tower in the area until we realized that it definitely wasn't.  We kept looking at it trying to figure out why there were these objects or one big object in the sky.   As we kept watching, the whole thing seemed to hover down towards the ground (but at this point it was obviously in the sky, behind some buildings).  They seemed to disappear, and a few minutes later, all three came back up into our view.   The shape was in the shape of a triangle, and as it hovered back up farther in the sky, the triangle shape became somewhat distorted.   There were three different red things slowly getting higher in the sky, as they slowly, one-by-one, faded out into nothing.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
4 orange lights moving quickly forming different shapes in the sky;2013-07-06 21:50:00;4 minutes;4 orange lights moving quickly forming different shapes in the sky As we were driving home I noticed out of the corner of my eye something that looked like a firework.   It was one orange dot in the sky that separated into 3 all of a sudden after separating the objects started circling eachother And moving pretty fast.   They dissappeared once and when it came back there were four.   They started making a constellation shape straight up and down and the after about 4 minutes disappeared altogether.  Never a believer until 9:50 tonight.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Shape shifting Light Orbs.;2013-10-12 19:45:00;2.5-3 minutes;Shape shifting Light Orbs First, felt compelled to turn around and look at sky while out canoeing on a small lake.  We saw what looked like 3 to 5 dark orange hovering orbs still and silent.  Position was N to Ne just above tree line. Next, as we turned canoe to get a better look the large low hovering orbs began to float up and away glowing like Chinese lanterns.  However, we knew they were not.  At first they looked like large oval glowing jellyfish then appeared to shift into a more lantern like shape as they floated upwards silently. The third phase was when they appeared smaller and more brightly colored but were still much bigger and lower than stars.  They locked into a formation at about fifty degrees above the horizon and floated in that formation more directly north.  This formation looked like the top of Orion the Hunter, or possibly a circular form with a shape inside it much like an arrow or cross.  Unfortunately part of this formation was hidden behind a building on the end of the lake so we couldn't fully make it out. The next phase of this encounter was 8 to 10 stars looking like they were blinking in multi colored lights much like Christmas lights.  Their appearance in size was at least 10 to 20 times larger than an actual star would appear.  It would be comparable to holding a dime about a foot in front of your eye, but a little more cylindrical.  They resembled radio stars in they way they flashed multiple colors blue, white , red , yellow, green.  They danced around each other like bees over flowers in silent circles somewhat erratic in this pattern as if they were swirling around each other. Finally they organized once again and formed a perfect hatchet shape with the rectangular piece facing west at the top and a long handle on the right or east side each dot representing a light bright type of design of perfect angles to create a clear shape.  They flashed a couple of times as though to show off their display, or the final act of this show. Lastly they filed slowly out of the hatchet type of shape drifting off to the Northwest sky, up and away.  They almost seemed to puff out one by one like a burnt out firework.  We were so transfixed at this point we didn't want the experience to end.  They seemed to possess an intelligence.  They seemed to know we were watching.  One final light lingered as we focused on it, then disappeared into the NW along with the others.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

White light in clear sky, flickered then appeared as thinner chrome object, 10-15 seconds duration.;2017-04-08 15:36:00;10-15 seconds;White light in clear sky, flickered then appeared as thinner chrome object, 10-15 seconds duration. While driving south on Maple Canyon (about 50 yards north of the Dublin-Granville Rd intersection) I came to a stop due to a red traffic light.  A flash of white light ahead in the clear blue sky caught my eye, at first thinking it was an airplane.   By judging the distance/height of the object, I would place it somewhere around 15,000 ft in the air, appearing to be about the diameter of 1.5-2 commercial airliners.  The white light (circular/oval shape) became smaller (about half the size), returned to its original size, then with a flash of chrome suddenly appearing (as if turning or changing shape and reflecting sunlight possibly), a thinner flat shape became visible and without the white circular/oval light.  While still stopped due to traffic I never lost focus of the object, but it then completely vanished.   No trails visible anywhere near where I witness the object, only clear blue skies.  The duration of the event was 10-15 seconds.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Cloudless sunny afternoon sighting of 3 large fireballs and many smaller ones seen through binoculars;2019-03-23 16:00:00;45 minutes;Cloudless sunny afternoon sighting of 3 large fireballs and many smaller ones seen through binoculars. My daughter called for me to come outside because her and her sister could see something strange in the sky.  When I went out I saw 3 orange-ish balls of light in a rough isosceles triangle.  I immediately sent my daughter back in to get her father and the binoculars.  When they came out my husband looked through the binoculars and exclaimed that there were many smaller ones too.  We all took turns looking and there were roughly 50 smaller ones between the bigger 3 that were nearly impossible to see with the naked eye. At first glanc,e the large ones looked like stationary explosions, but through the binoculars you could see them moving in place at different rates.  They looked eerily similar to what protein folding looks like.  We got out our telescope and kept observing until we couldn't see them anymore.  They slowly spread out but still stayed in a rough triangle.   Eventually, we could only see one, and then none.  This was all during a cloudless sunny afternoon.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
