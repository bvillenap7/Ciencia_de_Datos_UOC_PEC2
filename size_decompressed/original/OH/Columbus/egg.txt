Flying object in Columbus Ohio July 15th 3am.;2012-07-15 03:00:00;15 minutes;Flying object in Columbus Ohio July 15th 3am. Around 3am Sunday July 15th, I noticed what looked like a ball of fire travel from North to South over the Gahanna Ohio area (which is east of my location).  The ball of fire then ferried toward my location.  As it was approaching I realized it was an egg shaped object with flames around the bottom.  I ran in and got my wife.  As we watched the object got closer to us then turned toward the North and was gone.  We waited and watched the sky and pretty soon(within 5 minutes) the object appeared again in the East and traveled west towards us, turned north and then was gone again and it did not return.  I was wondering if it was a drone or something like that it looked like it was following the same pattern, maybe marking a grid or something.  I would just like to know if you have heard of anything in the area that could have been perceived as what I described, I would appreciate any feedback. Thank you.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
