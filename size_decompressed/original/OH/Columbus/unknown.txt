In Columbus, Ohio we heard music and saw flashing lights that appeared to be coming from something flying through our neighborhood.;2002-09-06 05:15:00;1-2 minutes;In Columbus, Ohio we heard music and saw flashing lights that appeared to be coming from something flying through our neighborhood. Around 5:15 am on September 6, 2002, we awoke to hear the sound of something flying in the air close to the roof of our house. As the sound got nearer, there was a musical quality to it. We could also see lights flashing all around the interior of our bedroom. The lights appeared to be red, white, and yellow. The sound moved away after about 15 seconds, then after about 30-45 seconds, the sound and lights seemed to come back around. The music seemde more like the tones of a composition and not like someone's radio. We were wondering if anyone else saw or heard this and could provide more information.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Cloud formations with a light emmiting from the center of one.;2004-06-28 01:37:00;1 minute;Cloud formations with a light emmiting from the center of one. I can't say for certain if there where more than one bright light/object, however I walked outside to have a smoke and looker up at the west sky line. It was clear to the east and became slightly clouded as you looked west. I saw what I can only describe as odd clouds. About eight of them they stood out in a strange way. There were other clouds but this looked like the fall out of fireworks except they pulsated briefly. I heard no explosions. Thet were plain as day, I walked across the parking lot to get out of the parking security lights for a better look. They were faiding very slowly but just fast enough to wonder what the hell the deal was with them. I trecognized that they were dwindling and finially they faded out completely. I noticed that the first cloud to dim out came back for a second with what I thought was a craft like image in the middle causing it to be seen. I certainly have seen strange lights before but this was very strange. It was like I caught the end of something but when the first cloud came back it was too much to accept as weather related, something caused it. I heard nothing the whiole time except a train in the background.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Unknown light from the sky shinning on the ground;2004-08-12 05:27:00;1 minute;Unknown light from the sky shinning on the ground About 5:27 in the morning on August 12, 2004, my wife was in the basement washing clothes when she notices a strange light on the security monitor that was come straight down from the sky and dancing at the base of our back steps just outside of our summer gazebo. She then came running up the step call my name since I was also up watching a movie on cable as she ran to the back door to see what it really was, but when she got there the light had vanished. A few days went by before I decide to check the security monitor tape to see what exactly what she saw and I was surprise and amaze to find what the security cameral had catch.  First I thought if might have been a police helicopter even thought that night either my wife nor myself had heard one, but to be on the safe side I call the Columbus City Police and they gave me the helicopter division and I was told that all helicopter had not flown since about 4 that morning. Second thing came to mind was maybe it could have been an aircraft since we did live not to far from the airport. So I call the air traffic control towers and they told me that there were not air traffic at that time on morning and it did not start up until about 15 to 30 minute after the stated time. This left me with now what cause the light that came straight down out of the sky that make no noise what so ever and dance at the foot of my step. I have watched this tape footage for over a year trying to find so possible way that someone could have do this. From someone standing on my root to someone in a tree with a spot light, but for light to bend the way it did left me just a puzzle as it did when the first time I saw it. I finally decide to file this official report that I have a video tape of some strange light from an unknown source in the sky shining and dancing on the ground at the base of my back step as if it was looking for something. I have waited for it to happen again but to my knowledge this was the first and only time it happen other than when my two oldest teenage kid had said when they was small that they saw some color lights shining in their bedroom window which is on the same side of the house as the back step and the window was on the side of the house and back steps was on the corner as the window. If you have any idea what the light are please let me know. I donâ€™t know if the light had any color to it because it was taken by a cameral that take picture on the gray scale. I still have the Video tape of that night;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Set of bright lights close together (as if on one craft), stationary in sky, and then dart southward and disappear.;2011-09-05 20:45:00;2 minutes;Set of bright lights close together (as if on one craft), stationary in sky, and then dart southward and disappear. I was traveling in my vehicle going westbound from Newark, OH to Columbus, OH on route 161.  On the freeway, I was near to New Albany.  On my left, I would say in the sky West-SouthWest, I saw several bright, white lights that I at first thought could be an aircraft (a plane for instance).  Then I noticed that the plane did not move.  I then thought perhaps it did not seem to move (to my perception) because it was high in the sky.  But, after a short time, it still did not seem to move.  The all of a sudden, it quickly darted to the south, and then quickly disappeared from sight.  The several lights were very close together, which I thougt would be part of one craft.  About five minutes later I saw a second set of bright lights, but in the North-NorthWest area, stationary, and then simply cease (disappear).;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Woke up inside of a tanning bed-like enclosement, appeared to be traveling with high turbulence, alien zapped me.;2017-07-08 01:30:00;90 minutes;Woke up inside of a tanning bed-like enclosement, appeared to be traveling with high turbulence, alien zapped me back unconscious Possible abduction?  Hard to say.. But here is an account of the incident.  I fell asleep on my couch in Columbus, OH at around 1:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on 7-8-17.  Then I woke up on my back, inside of what I equated to being an enclosed tanning bed-like apparatus.  It felt as if I was traveling at a high rate of speed and the ride was very turbulent.  I began to look around and one of the things I remember seeing is a worn down yellow labeling on the inside of whatever the hell I was enclosed in.  The next thing I know, at least my head was no longer enclosed as I saw an alien take an object and touched my forehead with it and I was out cold.  I woke back up on couch in the exact same position I fell asleep on with my CPAP on just as it was prior to this possible abduction.  I had no fear, not sure why..  In the ensuing minutes after waking up I tried to make sense of what had happened.  There was no missing time, I was back up within a half hour. Had a sick like feeling in my stomach, open waking up and its been on and off all day. Description of the alien I saw:  Structurally, it was similar to many of the common air craft aliens we see in our American pop culture documentaries (Short around 3 feet, thin body, big dark eyes, funny shaped head) accept this one had rather dark scaly skin, not true gray.  One the the things that stood out was the wide of its arm and forearm, it was the equivalent of a broomstick width the arm was the same width as the forearm.  I was unconscious seconds after he put the object between my eyebrows and forehead. Other information about me which you may or may not find relevant. Since the age of 8 years old I have been an experiencer of sleep paralysis -entity attacks, but even before this the paranormal world seemed to antagonize me at a really young age.  I can remember some things just before the age of two.  I've had thousands of negative nocturnal (non physical) attacks by paranormal entities, like smacking, prodding, choking and senses manipulation (I've also had a few positive ones like when I was tapped on the shoulder after falling asleep while feeding my infant son a bottle which caused the nipple to go adrift from his mouth.   Lately, I'd say within the last year, I've seen very bright lights in my dreams on more than one occasion.  I have been spiritually probed several times, mostly in the back of my head - cerebellum, but also in the navel and unfortunately my fudge tunnel a time or two. I'm not psychotic or mental, I've never done drugs, and rarely consume alcohol.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Last night, I had sleep paralysis unlike any other time before.  Except this time, I opened my eyes.;2019-01-22 22:00:00;15 minutes to 2 hours;Last night, I had sleep paralysis, unlike any other time before.  Except this time, I opened my eyes (so I believed I opened them) except I could only see out of the center of my forehead.  I would blink and felt like I only had my one eye.  I saw and heard what looked like 3 or 4 grey beings with the big black oval eyes.  Except they looked like they were caught and starting to hurry up and stop because they realized I woke up.   Anyway, my vision out of my one eye was a little blurry because it looked as if I was looking through a clear kaleidoscope.  I felt like I was telling them to go away and leave me alone and so they did.  This time, I didn't wake up from that, I just kept sleeping.  So, what I acknowledged was going on (I think telepathically) was my vision from that one eye was crystallized.  And also telepathically, I told them to stop and they looked like why were doing something good for you.  And they hurried up and left me with my blurry eye.  Like, I could see their heads moving and looking at one another conversing among each other to hurry, but they didn't hesitate much until I realized wait a minute, I'm stronger than you  that's when they fled entirely and I slept peacefully without waking up from the experience.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
