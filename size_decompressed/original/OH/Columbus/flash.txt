2 bright flashes in the sky.;1999-08-09 22:30:00;2 seconds;2 bright flashes in the sky. My two brothers and I where headed east on east main st. We saw 2 flashes that lit up the sky there was no sound. They seemed to come from the south. So we turned down Yearling rd. to Livingston, where there was a abandoned car.There where 5 or 6 people around the car. We stoped to asked what hapened. but no body really knew what was going on. We asked about the lights and they said they saw it also but didn't know what it was. It was like a very bright camera flash.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Over the South side of Columbus, Ohio.;2016-02-19 21:00:00;2 hours;Over the South side of Columbus, Ohio I have no idea what I saw last night. there were 100's of white orbs very high in the sky.  Above the clouds..  I am saying orbs because they weren't close enough to tell.  They looked like stars but they were traveling from East to West at a high rate of speed.  No real pattern except about every 5 or 10 minutes there would be a group of 3 at a slight angle to each other.   I am saying it lasted 2 hours only because I am going by when I first spotted them to when I couldn't see them anymore.  Because it got real cloudy after that.  But they were not stars and they did not appear to be planes.  Besides, I have never seen that many planes in the same area at the same time before.  And there was absolutely No Sound.   I just want to know what there were and if anyone else seen them.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
