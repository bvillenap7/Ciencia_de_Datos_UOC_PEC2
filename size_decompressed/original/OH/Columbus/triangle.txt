Very large triangular craft moved silently and darkly (no lights) very fast through dark Columbus OH night.;1997-01-10 22:00:00;15 seconds;Very large triangular craft moved silently and darkly (no lights) very fast through dark Columbus OH night. Very large triangular object, completely dark (no lights whatsoever) and no sound whatsoever(!) moved very quickly at approx 1-2 miles overhead (guess). This UFO was very large (It was defintiely triangular being approx 3 -4 football fields wide at back by the same in length (again a guess)). It was moving quickly through the sky.. duration from immediate happenchance view directly overhead to passing out of sight approx 10 - 15 seconds. This thing did not mean to be seen! Completely by chance I looked up and saw it. The night sky had just enough illumination to be able to see this large dark object. The site area was approx 3 miles from downtown Columbus. I have never seen anything like this in my 42 years of age and it has taken me 10 years to report it ( I was 32 at the time)... I am a professional businessman and father of two children, college-educated and very scientific-minded but skeptical of possibilities of likely Ets in this universe being able to travel light year distances to be here but I am convinced this was not a craft from this world. I am certain.. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
I saw a dark, triangular craft gliding across the sky in Columbus, Ohio.;1997-06-15 18:00:00;45 seconds;I saw a dark, triangular craft gliding across the sky in Columbus, Ohio. It's been quite a while since I've seen the object I'm going to describe so I'm foggy as to the exact date. I do remember the actual incident quite vividly, though, and will do my best to describe it. I was driving north on highway 315. As I approached the exit to get on Bethel Road, I noticed a dark object moving overhead heading south/south-west. It seemed to be gliding slowly overhead, quietly, quite aways away, yet close enough that I could estimate it as being maybe 3-4 car-lengths in size. In the dusk sky light available, it appeared to be dark (black or dark grey) in color. It was still very clear out so I'm positive it was a triangular craft of which I'd never seen before at that time. I must mention that I was driving a convertible car with the top off so I did in fact get a clear view of the object. There were many other cars on 315 and on Bethel Road at the time so I'd be surprised if no others saw it too. I only wish I'd had a camera with me then. At first, I thought it was some experimental craft being tested from the nearby OSU airport on West Case Road, which is located a few miles away from where I saw the craft. It wasn't until I started seeing similar triangular UFO sightings in books and on television that I realized the craft I saw wasn't some local aircraft project. The image of the craft that was photographed in the Belgium sighting was almost identical to the one I saw, the only difference being the one I saw didn't have lights shining underneath each corner, perhaps because the sky was fairly still light outside. Not until I came across this site did I feel there was a neutral way for me to report my sighting without being ridiculed. Please honor my privacy and don't release my name. Thank you.

I first noticed a long, thin, sort of cigar shaped bright white light slowly moving W to E behind my house. Upon looking out the window;1998-02-20 22:57:00;8 min.;I first noticed a long, thin, sort of cigar shaped bright white light slowly moving W to E behind my house. Upon looking out the window that was gone but, after several seconds 3 lights just came on, about 150 or 200 ft. up. They were in a triangular formation, the front being yellow, one red and one green. These lights made several odd manuvers and never flashed or blinked we are realatively close to Port Columbus so, I am used to seeing airplanes and helicopters yet, I have never seen anything like this. The long, bright white light was odd because it seemed to be close and flying very low,( 20-40 ft.), and even though this was a very intense bright white light it cast no light on surrounding objects. I could see the trees in my neighbor's yard silohetted against the light as it moved across the neighbor's yard. This object was about as long as the first joint of your finger,( from the tip of your finger to the first knuckle), held at arms length - as I sat about 22 ft. from the window that I saw it through. The triangular shaped object that I saw after I got up and went to the window appeared over the intersection of Morse & Westerville Roads at an altitiude of about 100-150 ft. and headed due North, in my general direction. Once it got slightly North of Morse Rd.,( which runs E & W), it banked slightly and headed west, the whole time going about 25-35 mph. The object traveled West until it was 200 ft. or so past Westerville Rd. then, came to a stop rotated 180 degrees and began flying back East at about the same speed as before. When the object got back to where it origanally began moving to the West it suddenly got a burst of speed like nothing I've ever seen and made a U-turn that seemed to take it slightly higher and its own width to the South. This U-turn was one of the main things that made me stop and think  Hey this is not a helicopter or airplane because, just last year I went to the Dayton Airshow and saw how fast these modern millitary planes can accelerate. Let me tell you nothing I have ever seen could do this- not to mention the g-forces this manuver would have exerted on a pilot would have been more than any human could ever stand. After this abrupt U-turn the object immediately returned to its previous snail like speed and continued on to the West. As it got about 300 ft. or so from Westerville Rd. it slowly turned to the South South West and as it made this turn all the lights instantly turned red but, there was no blink or flash as though I was seeing a different side of the object, the lights just simply switched colors!!!! After the object had changed course and color it just flew at the same slow speed out of my field of view to the Southwest. This triangular object seemed to emmit a wide, highly despirsed light at about a 45 degree angle, from the front yellow light- this light is totally different than a normal search light on a helicopter. It also seemed like there was a triangular shadow inbetween the lights so that since the sky was overcast the clouds were slightly brighter than the object itself- so, it was possible to make out the shape but, there was only a slight hint of it. The object appeared to be an equilateral triangle of about 50-75 ft. per side. I also stuck my head out the door during the sighting and heard no sound, other than the usual traffic sounds, and there was no change in the object's appearance.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Saw a grey shadow coming out of the east, heading Northwest.  It appeared to be a dark grey shape, like a wing, just a bit lighter than the sky.  Perhaps it was a B-2? All the object did was fly across the sky.  I was observing from a point about 1 mile west and slightly south of the Ohio State University. It took about 15 seconds. I didn't hear any noise. Though it was shaped like a wing (flying wing/boomerang/triangle are ways to describe it), and it was dark grey overall, there were lighter markings as well (lighter grey specks) -- perhaps camoflage paint? (Again, I'm assuming this was a Stealth bomber) I couldn't judge its distance, but it was about the size, relatively to my perspective, of the three stars in Orion's belt);39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

As it grew closer I noticed it was triangular in shape.  It made a banking turn and continued north and out of sight. I am a police officer for a suburb of Columbus, OH.  I had a ride-along passenger, who is a reserve officer for another agency in the area.  We were attempting to find a dark area within the city to observe the Leonid Meteor Shower as it was a slow night.  We had driven back into a railroad yard and stopped the cruiser.  We had been there no longer than five minutes when I noticed an object coming from east to west just west of downtown Columbus.  At first I assumed it was an airplane.  I quickly realized this was not the case.  It appeared similar in shape to an F-117 Stealth Fighter as it approached head-on.  I say this because it seemed to have similar sharp angled features.  After watching it for about 5-10 seconds I told my partner to get out of the car as I was doing the same.  I pointed in it's direction and said Do you see that thing?  He too spotted the object just before it began to make a slow right banking turn.  As it turned, it showed it's underside completely to us.  It appeared to be an equalateral triangle shape.  There were no flashing lights of any kind on the craft.  It's underside had some sort of distortion to it almost as if it were camaflouged.  There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft.  It appeared to be relatively close to us and I actually tried to shine my spotlight on it to light it up but it was too far away to be illuminated by it.  We often have the police helicopter fly by as we are close to the heliport and it was much larger in size comparison than the helicopter although it appeared to be at a similar altitude.  After completing it's turn it leveled off and continued north having just made a 90 degree turn.  It was travelling slowly across the sky slower than the helicopter would to use it as a comparison again.  It just seemed to glide as a stingray does through the ocean.  It disappeared out of sight to the north of our location.  I called another officer to meet me and we told him about the incident.  He suggested I call Port Columbus Airport.  I end! ed up ca lling the Airport Police and identified myself to them and asked if there was anyway they could find out if the tower had anything unidentified on their radar.  After being on hold for a couple minutes the dispatcher advised me she'd been in touch with Tracon and they had nothing unusual on their radar in the time frame I'd reported.  I cannot say what the craft was but I can say it was like nothing I've ever seen and the odd part is that it was completely silent.  I have seen and F-117 fly and I know they are quite loud.  I can also say with 100% certainty it was not any type of meteor.  It was close enough to us that we could distinctly see it's edges and shape although it was not self illuminated.  I could not say for sure what color it was as it just appeared dark in the sky.  It would have been very easy to miss had we not been looking right at it.  I am truly baffled by what we saw.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Triangle hovering near freeway.;2001-12-24 18:11:00;6-10 minutes;Triangle hovering near freeway. Heading I-70 East in darkness with the headlights on and westbound traffic as heavy as the eastbound side from a distance of about 6 miles, I saw a bright light that appeared to be siting still on the westbound side of the highway. The closer I got to it, the more it looked like two lights. When I was nearly beside it, it seemed to be about 1500 to 2000 feet up and just sitting still. While going past it, I lowered my window with the radio turned completely down, and I heard no sound. I could barely see the shape of a triangle. In the front, two lights were noticeable, one at one corner, and one at another. A third light was observed at the back (apex) that was much dimmer. It was not a helicopter, as I am an EMT who has been around them before and know their sounds. I had my Cb radio on and didn't hear anyone else saying they saw it. Visibility was clear and stars could be seen in the background. With the thumb out, this object was about the size of my thumbnail.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

I thought it was 3 planes flying together at first, but they were in unison the whole flight, there were red and white flashing lights. They made a triangle formation. Peter also states that the three triangular lights were spread so far apart, he knew it was not an airplane of any type. The craft was moving fast enough that the sighting only lasted a minute or two. The object finally disappeared from view.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Bright lights in triangular pattern 'hang' in sky, then accelerate and fade from view.;2003-03-07 00:15:00;15s;Bright lights in triangular pattern 'hang' in sky, then accelerate and fade from view. I was flying as co-pilot in a Cessna Citation II (am myself an ATP-rated Learjet captain) westward at 39000 feet when I saw three bright lights in a triangular pattern (not equilateral -- more like a right triangle, though that may be a matter of orientation of the object) simply hanging in the sky to the north near Cassiopeia, at an estimated altitude of 45-49000 feet.  I asked my partner if he was watching it and he said yes.  The lights were all of a greater relative magnitude than Sirius -- perhaps equalling or greater than Venus in brightness.  After about 5 to 10 seconds, the lights began to move eastward, accelerating rapidly and fading from view simultaneously (may have been receding?).  No aircraft in my experience has ever accelerated so quickly.  We believe it was one object -- though no details could be made out between the lights -- else the three separate objects would have had to have been maintaining a precise formation during acceleration.  Each of the observers have been flying aircraft for over 15 years, and neither of us had ever seen anything like this.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

The object had white lights around the bottom of the craft that seemed to pulsate while it moved. It also had a red beacon light in the middle of it that just glowed. When I saw the red light I figured that it was just a plane until it did something that convential aircraft DO NOT do: IT HOVERED!!! When I saw it do that, I immediately turned my car around to get a closer look at the object. Once I turned the car around to get a better look, it seemed as though the object just disappeared into the night sky. I'm not sure how many people saw this object but it caused enough of a disturbance on the ground to cause near accidents because some were trying to look at it while they were driving.

Triangle UFO seen near Port Columbus International Airport was ''wobbly''.;2010-11-28 19:00:00;8-10 minutes;Triangle UFO seen near Port Columbus International Airport was ''wobbly''. I had just ate dinner, and walked outside around 7:50pm to go smoke a cigarette. The night was clear and I could see the stars. I was standing there and noticed a craft appear near Port Columbus International Airport. I thought it was a plane taking off from its location due to the low altitude of the craft. I thought nothing of it and just put it off. I then watched the craft make a complete circle around the perimeter of my location, and thought it was flying awfully low among the tree lines. As the craft approached my location I moved up the driveway to catch a better glimps. As the craft moves overhead I was directly underneith and could see the shape of a triangle with white lights at each point and a blinking red light in the middle of the craft. It not emit any type of sound or engine roar. The craft seemed ''wobbly'' and was headed in an Westbound direction. The craft was less then 1,000 feet. I could see a defined triangle shape of the craft. It was! completly silent. I had seen other aircraft near the vacinity and they did emit loud sound, they were obviously planes going to and fro the airport.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Tonight at 12:20am I saw a huge triangular shaped UFO.  It was like 20 times larger than the Concord that used to fly commercially in the U.S. (Maybe larger since I was looking from a distance.)  I was going east on the north side of 270 close to Worthington.  Then I saw this thing swoop across the sky like in 2 seconds and it was gone.  It was cloudy so the object was kind of blended in a haze but I did see 3 lights on the bottom of it.  It could not have been an airplane because it was too big and way too fast.

3 red, glowing objects hovering in Columbus, OH.;2015-07-05 22:30:00;3-4 minutes;3 red, glowing objects hovering in Columbus, OH I was letting the dog out around 10:30 p.m. when I looked up into the southwest sky in Columbus, Ohio.  Three red beams of light were shining brightly in the shape of a triangle.  What was most odd was that the object seemed to hover in the same location (unlike an airplane) for several minutes.  At first, I thought the object was shaped like a stealth bomber, except that it appeared white in color.  My other thoughts was that the red, glowing objects had white beams of light connecting them together. I ran inside to tell my husband and daughter to come outside to verify what I saw.  By the time they got outside, there were only two, red glowing lights connected by a single white beam of light.  My daughter saw the bottom one disappear first and then the top one followed suit.  My husband also saw the two lights fade away into the sky. During this time, I ran through my house to the backyard to see if they would travel in a typical flight path.  However, there were absolutely no signs of the objects.  Their disappearance was quite unusual in nature. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Black triangle craft with 8 - 10 yellowish-white lights on side/red underbelly lights/quietly hums past window.;2016-08-29 11:55:00;2-4 minute;Black triangle craft with 8 - 10 yellowish-white lights on side/red underbelly lights/quietly hums past window. My girlfriend and I were about to lay down to go to sleep when she pointed out a craft in the distance.  She said it was sitting still until I looked out the window.  The craft moved very slowly going toward the East, somewhat hiding in the tree lines.  It then made a very smooth turn, heading toward the West this time, and came back into our view. The craft then very slowly hovered right past our window, there was probably 8 to 10 yellowish-white lights on the side we could see, and at least two red lights on the belly of the craft.  This thing was literally at the height of the power lines, made virtually no sound until it was passing right next to the house.  It made a very faint humming sound - we live really close to an airport so we're pretty familiar with airplane sounds and their landing lights. It was a black triangle shape from what we could make out. It was insane how close we were to this thing.  You could've probably pegged this thing with a rock, it was flying so low. And at the speed this thing hovered, any other aircraft would've definitely been stalling out.  I didn't take any pictures because my camera on my phone has awful quality. We plan to watch out the window again tonight, just in case we see anything. I plan on taking pictures and/or video this time, if anything happens.  I've seen two other ufo's when I was younger, but this one was definitely the closest encounter I've had.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
6 to 7 bright white lights on triangular craft - North Columbus;2016-08-30 23:56:00;3-5 minutes;6 to 7 bright white lights on triangular craft - North Columbus My girlfriend and I were watching the sky again, and we saw something flying in the distance, the craft came from the same direction, and did the same exact movements as it had the night before.  It actually descended vertically with no horizontal movement.  We saw no red or green lights present on the craft.  (Indicating a commercial or even military aircraft.)  It came from the North, until it got around some trees, made a gradual 90 degree turn and began heading to the West.  (In the direction of the airport here.)  We see tons of planes coming in and landing all day, everyday.  This thing was not a commercial airliner. It was flying entirely too slow, too low, and was way too quiet to be a passenger airliner, and had too many lights on it.  (And in the wrong places/not having the correct lights for an airplane.)  It flew pretty slowly past the house, it was probably about 100 - 250 feet away (maybe a bit more) from the house, and it was flying at a pretty low altitude, I'd guess somewhere around maybe 200-400 feet area possibly.  I actually managed to snap a few quick pictures of the thing, which I will attach to this. What was odd to me was the fact that there weren't any other airplanes coming in for about 10 - 15 minutes before this craft came, and nothing came in to the airport for about 15 - 20 minutes after we saw the craft.  There is also an Air Force base pretty close by (Rickenbacker AFB), but that base is roughly 30 minutes to the South of us. This one did have a sound, like a plane - but a very, very quiet plane. (It was more quiet than a single prop airplane.) We didn't hear the noise of it until it was passing the house, and for a brief moment after it had already passed by the house. It had at least 6 - 7 bright white lights present on it. (That's only counting the lights on the left side and back side of the craft.) It was very dark, but it was most likely a black craft, and the way the lights were situated on the craft, it had to be a triangular craft. Note:  Normally we hear crickets outside all night long, but when this craft hovered past us, it was dead quiet outside with the occasional sound of vehicles on the nearby highways and the craft when it hovered by.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Black Triangle UFO/TR-3B sighting North of John Glenn Int'l Airport Ohio;2019-11-01 06:35:00;1 minute;Black Triangle UFO/TR-3B sighting North of John Glenn Int'l Airport Ohio While carpooling to work on the morning of Nov 1, 2019 on I-270 South, I noticed some bright and seemingly close lights to my right side (from passenger seat). I glanced at the lights and assumed it was an airliner as it was directly north of Columbus Int'l Airport, but took a second look because it seemed strange. I immediately noticed that the lights/object had not moved, only hovering in place and there were very bright white lights at 3 corners of the object with dimmer yellow/orange lights in the center. The lights were flashing in a random order across the object. The object never changed position and was hovering quite low in the sky (I was able to directly observe it from the car without straining or moving). I was able to make out clearly the shape of the object against the clouds, which was a very large, black/dark grey triangle. It appeared to be roughly the size of an airliner, or possibly larger.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
