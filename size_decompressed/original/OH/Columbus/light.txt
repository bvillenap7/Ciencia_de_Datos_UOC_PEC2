The object moved at right angles.;1976-06-01 20:00:00;2 minutes;The object moved at right angles. I was looking out my window at night. I was looking southwest (in the direction of WPAFB). I saw a brite light that moved slowly in vertical and horizontal directions. It would move vertically, then stop and remain stationary for a few moments, then move horizontally, and stop, and it repeated that cycle a number of times. Then, in an instant, it disappeared by accelerating extremely quickly. It must have taken it less than .1-.2 of a second to disappear. A few points I'd like to make. First, when it was moving slowly and turning at what appeared bo be exact right angles, and starting and stopping, it did not appear to accelerate. This is what initially caught my eye. In other words, it moved without accelerating it moved at a precise and steady speed and motion. Second, when it finally did 'take off' into the sky and disappear, it DID seem to accelerate, but at a phenomenal rate. Years later I was teaching in Taiwan. We had a discussion in class about UFOs. I asked my students if any of them had ever seen one. After a period of silence, one young man shared his story of having seen a UFO in Taiwan, I believe it was in the early or mid 80's. As he described what he had seen, I got goose bumps. He described exactly what I had seen in Ohio years ago. His description included elements such as turning at right angles, moving and stopping, then taking off ... it was uncanny. He was describing exactly what I had seen. Thank you.

Car headlights went out suddenly. I had seen Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind a few years ago.  (therefore the date I gave above is only an estimate)  When the lights went out suddenly, I pulled to the right side of interstate 70.  I was headed south.  My 2 companions were go-go dancers.  I was taking them home. I stopped the car and thought that the senario reminded me of the aformentioned movie.  The fog was thick but when I looked to my right I saw a farm house  thousands of yards away that had a large red light above it.  It illuminated the whole area.  I thought at first it was a helicopter searching for some lost kids or something.  But the red light stayed fixed on the farmhouse.  I noticed there was no sound. The huge red light and no sound made me suspicious.  I tried to figure a a reasonable explanation for it, but could find none.  I kept thinking that the red light would move, but it didn't.  The light was so large, I reasoned, that it could not be a helicopter, either. ( I had not read any ufo books on abductions at this time.  Only later did I realize that what I saw appeared to be a classic abduction case.) After watching it for a half hour or more, I realized that this could be a UFO.  I raised my right hand,( in a form of greeting, with palm foreward) and said in my mind.  I have a son at home, please don't take me.  I felt immediately a tingling sensation on my palm, like they had heard my message.  I tried to awaken the two women in the back seat.  However, they did not wake up, no matter how I tried to make them.  I blieve I finally saw the light move some to my right, slowly. Still no sound.  After some time of watching the red light, I fell asleep.  I drove back home  hours later when it was light, as my lights still did not work.  I took the car to a repair shop and asked them pointedly about what caused my headlights to go out.  They said they did not know.  I had to have both headlights replaced.

Light changing color in accordance with the traffic light.;1992-05-15 21:00:00;Not Sure;Light changing color in accordance with the traffic light. I'm not sure of the date because it has been so long since i have seen it, but I was staying at St. Vincent's Children's Center on East Main Street.  I was in 6th grade at the time, and i was also living in the residential unit at the school.  I was in bed, along with my room mates ((deleted)) .  I saw a brilliant flash of white light and i got up and opened the window to see what it was. Then the white light faded out and I saw the traffic light outside was changing colors erradically...it would go from yellow to green then to red, and so on.  Then i looked up and to the left of it, and saw there was another light in the sky, changing colors exactly the same way.  The traffic light was about 50 feet away, and from my vantage point it looked like the UFO was about twice it's distance, hovering at maybe 150 feet. After i observed this for about 45 seconds, an even brighter white light shined onto me, and i had for some reason an intense feeling of joy, followed by an intense feeling of dread or fear.  The next thing i knew, the person who was on duty that night came into the bathroom and said Are you okay, ((deleted))?  You've been in here for almost an hour.  That was the last time i'd ever mentioned it to anyone.  If you can, please leave my contact info in this explanation. I am an amatuer UFO investigator, and i still to this day haven't seen anything close to what i saw that day.  In fact, the event at that school was what inspired me to investigate UFO sightings.  If anyone wishes to contact me to tell me about anything they may have seen, they can email me at ((deleted))@aol.com.  Thank you for your time.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

After moving to the north, the light started to fade, moving away from us to the west. My friend and I saw a light moving through the sky really slow. It was moving slightly to the north, very slowly. Every couple of minutes, the light would start to fade, and when it did, the object moved to the north a little faster than what it did before. As soon as the light came to a stop, it would become a little brighter. After the light moved for an estimated 5 miles (we were far away from the light), the light switched from a northward route to a south-west one. Eventually the object got so far away, we couldn't see it anymore. This whole sighting lasted about 25 to 30 minutes. The light changed colors from red to white. If someone wasn't watching the light close enough, they wouldn't be able to tell it was moving. Two of us witnessed this light, and we both checked to see if we were seeing the same things as the object moved. My friend and I have seen odd things before, but this one topped it off. Neither of us have seen anything like it.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

When we was on top of it was when we seen the light underneath it, nothing like I could describe.  It left a trail, similar to a contrail, but very differant.

It appeared to leap into space almost institaniously;2000-07-23 23:30:00;15sec.;It appeared to leap into space almost institaniously I was attending a drive-in movie when i looked up in the sky and noticed what i thought was a airplane. I then noticed that it was moving much to slow to be an airplane. I thought maybe a helicopter thats when it flew off. When i say it flew off i don't just mean that it flew away into the curviture of the night sky ,i mean that it went up and out into space very, very fast,almost instintaniously from its spot low in the sky to the stars. Now i am definately not a expert in aviation but for a plane to pause then almost leap into space and disappear into the darkness of space at that speed is impossible. It went straight up and out.

Dancing star over Columbus, Ohio;2000-07-30 22:00:00;10 minutes;Dancing star over Columbus, Ohio At approximately 10:00 P.M. EST I stepped out onto my balcony to get a last look of my view as I moved out of my apartment this evening. I happened to look up at the partially cloudy sky to get a look at some stars. I noticed that the first star that I looked at seemed to be moving from the Western Sky in a South/Southeastern direction at a slow steady pace. I first figured I was seeing a passing satellite. To my amazement this star stopped changed direction to direct South then back West before it started to circle, zig-zag then continue in it's original direction. This star did this several times(atleast 5 times) before I lost it in a passing cloud. I can only describe this object as a star as that was its exact appearence. It was as bright as a star in the big dipper(not as bright as Jupiter or the northern stars though). There was some city lights drowning out much of the star field so this object may have appeared brighter a few miles out of town. I would suspect that few people would've not reported this unless they happened to be stargazing. Irredgardless, I just thought I would report this dancing star.

Unknown flash of light.;2003-06-24 21:00:00;few seconds;Unknown flash of light. I was in a local park just taking pictures of the evening sky on my digital camera.  I took a few pictures in a row, the flash went off automatically for 2 of them.  The first of the 2 with the flash seemed to show an object.  I have no idea what it is, but I was hoping someone with a more experience could tell me.  It looks like a reflection of light off of an object.  Given the distance, I doubt that my camera could pick up a reflection.  I zoomed in on it as much as I could on my computer, but that did not make it any more identifiable.  The part of the sky it was in is in line with aircraft landing and taking off from the columbus airport.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

This object flew directly over me and was a sigle uniform white light, with no sound and no blinking lights.  I saw no shape beyond the white orb.  It moved slightly slower than an airliner, and had a barely discernable surge in it's movement, that I noticed as it passed overhead and away from me.  As it passed northwest it actually crossed the path of a light aircraft moving SSE to NNE.    I observed it until it passed from view.  Intriguing.  Couldn't get it out of my mind and decided it was worth posting here.  Perhaps someone else has seen the same object.

2 bright objects, great distance from each other move in unison from W into SW, disappear simultaneously.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS? PD));2007-06-20 23:00:00;3 minutes;(Cols,Ohio) 2 bright objects, great distance from each other move in exact unison from W into SW Sky, disappear simultaneously My husband and I stepped outside last Wednesday evening, around 11pm June 20th.    It was a lovely evening, clear skies in all directions.   He faced East, I turned to look at the moon hanging in the western sky. I immediately noticed a very very bright object moving out of the west, moving very fast.   I began to ask my husband if it was probably a satellite, because I could not see any type of blinking as with most airplanes. We squinted, trying to decipher if there was blinking or not,  but he saw no blinking either. Right then we both noticed a second very bright object following at the exact same speed, in the exact same direction as the first.  From the ground, the bright objects would have appeared about 8-10 inches apart, so I don’t know what the actual distance would calculate to be,   but they were in unison , appearing as if the second object were being towed along.  We deliberated for a minute or two, concluding, that for satellites,  they were flying at a really low elevation ,  looking like they were inside our atmosphere,  not orbiting outside of it   And they were so bright,  as compared to most satellites which are usually only as bright as the stars & moving across the sky at a slow but steady rate.  My husband and I are very reasonable, logical people.   It was our instinct to dismiss the objects as some logical device which was operating normally in the sky. However,  standing there….. suggesting, squinting, contemplating the possibilities of what they were,  we suddenly saw the first object fade quickly and disappear completely. We were both astounded at this point.     Questioning why and where it could have gone,   watching the second object follow the same path,  & at the exact same place in the sky,……it too faded very quickly and disappeared completely. By now we were absolutely confused at what in the world we could be seeing.              The sky was completely clear &  the objects were gone, just like that.  They traveled out of the western sky in unison, and disappeared into the Southwestern sky at the same place in the sky. We talked excitedly and returned inside after a few moments.   My husband headed to bed.   I sat down to watch some Tv. At about 1am,  I was too curious to sleep without knowing, so I called Rickenbacher Airport, and was transferred to airport operations. I explained to the man on the phone, and he confirmed that he also saw the objects in the sky at that time.   He remembered seeing them because he too noticed how fast they were traveling. He had no actual confirmation,   but assumed the first object we saw was the international space station,  because it ‘probably’ has its solar panels out right now.  I said okay,   and mentioned again that they seemed so close,   too close to be floating outside of the earth. I asked him what was trailing it so far behind the object at the same speed, and he said he did not know what that could have been.     He told me they appeared to disappear  because at a certain point on the horizon, the sunlight does not reach the object anymore and it appears to disappear.     I accepted this. My husband brought up the point that the objects were no where near the horizon,   they were way up in the sky, almost overhead.    Im sure it is possible though.  My father keeps  suggesting it was the Space station and that the object behind it was probably the space shuttle which would be docked on it or very close.  However,   the distance even from our view was already too far for the objects to be docked together,  let alone what the actual distance would be up there. He also supported the disappearing horizon theory.  When I thought about it later  I realized Rickenbacher is a military installation.   I had called them thinking they would be a better authority than Port Columbus,    but now I realize, if there were anything unidentified up there,    a military installation would be the last to confirm it.  And so we left it at that.        No answers for the boatload of questions in our minds.  I have seen now that a Pilot flying over the English Channel last week, along with his passengers, all witnessed a very large Unidentified craft outside of their windows.      After it moved out of site,  the pilot stated that a second object appeared 5 minutes later.  I do not know whether the two sightings are related but I see an amazing coincidence between the timing and actual objects seen. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS? PD));39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

On Saturday, November 17th,  we had just dropped our son off to his third shift job at a mall when my wife remembered she left some things at her work, which is just across the street from where our son works nights.  We drove into the parking lot and I waited while she ran inside. Looking straight east I noticed the planet Jupiter bright in the eastern sky.  It was a clear night and cool. Just a little to the Northeast of Jupiter I noticed a small flashing light that just looked funny.  So I grabbed a pair of my binoculars that I keep in my van to get a better look.  Through the binocs I saw a huge white light with a red blue light on surrounding the bottom.  I thought it might be a prism effect of the binoculars when my wife came out of the building and asked what I was looking at. I pointed the light out.  She was looking with her naked eye and I through the binocs when suddenly the object split in half.  My wife commented, &quotdid you just see the light split! &quot?  She saw with her naked eye.  The object moved quickly apart, with the brighter part moving away from the red blue lighted half.  We watched for a few more minutes and then headed home keeping the separated object in view.  When we got home we quickly looked east again with binoculars just in time to see the object merge back together. Amazing sight to be sure.  I would guess the object was huge and at a great distance because of lack of detail.   As a closing thought, later that morning when I picked up my son from work at 6 AM Sunday morning, the object was gone and have not seen it in the sky since.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Then they moved into a triangle formation.  Each of the three round lights were at each point of the triangle and the fourth went to the left of the triangle and it's light went out.  They were in the triangle formation for about 5-10 seconds.   Then they went into a straight vertical line along with the fourth joining the three, which the fourth lit back up to get into formation.  They were in that pattern for about 10-15 seconds.   Then they dispersed from the pattern laterally from one another, however staying relatively close to each other.   All four of them started to descend in altitude until we could see them no more due to the tree line.   The whole duration was approximately 3-4 minutes.  We could tell these lights were several miles away and that they flew with a purpose, not a random act.  They flew at a leisurely pace.  I knew they were not fireworks and they were not planes.  There were people shooting off fireworks on the other side of the South Drive-In Theater.  There was also a commercial jet flying to the southwest of the four UFO's, heading southeast during the time the four lights were in the sky.  Afterward, there were two helicopters that flew over to where the four UFO's had been.  The helicopters seem to be searching for while.  They searched for approximately 10 minutes or so.  Although, we did not pay much attention to the helicopters after that.  I've never seen anything like this before.  All four of us saw them.  A lady in a car next to us was recording them with her cell phone after I pointed them out.  I hope she puts the video on YouTube.  I did not have anything to video record the four lights unfortunately.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Columbus Ohio area- orange and white lights;2013-07-06 21:20:00;10 minutes;Columbus Ohio area- orange and white lights I'm a 55 year old registered nurse, and the second witness is 60 year old retiree/ small business owner.   This evening as my husband and I were driving west on Broad Street, I observed about 8 orange lights in the southern sky.  They appeared at first to look like maybe chinese lanterns as they were floating from the horizon up and eastward toward Columbus.  They appeared to be fairly close, like they may have been released from the Battelle Darby Metro Park a few miles south of Broad Street.  I continued to watch as I had never seen any lights like this.  I wondered if they might have been a new type of firework as this is July 4th weekend and a lot of folks were letting off private fireworks in the area.  These lights didn't extinguish like I would have expected however.   I turned south on Murnan Road and lost sight of them because of some trees.  When I caught sight of them again, they appeared to be over the city of Columbus maybe 10 miles away.   Both my husband and I were surprised by the distance they covered.  We continued to watch as I tried to follow in the car.   From Murnan, I turned north on Alton, east on Hall, south on Galloway, and then east on Alkire.  Our view was obscured by trees during a good bit of this drive, but by the time we got to the golf course we then saw 4 bright white lights above the Grove City suburb just southwast of the city of Columbus.  These may or may not have been related to the 8 orange lights we viewed a bit earlier.   I pulled over into the back of the firehouse parking lot to get a better view.  These 4 lights did some unexpected things--on occasion one or more would fade out and then illuminate again, the lights would move around a bit, combine and then break apart.   There would be 4 then 2 then 3 then 4 again until eventually they all combined into one very bright white light which kind of blinked out.   During this time we both attempted to film with our iPhones but just couldn't get ! it together before the lights were gone.  They were absolutely! mesmerzing like I couldn't take my eyes off them.  We waited awhile, ready to film but they didn't come back- until later that is... At approximately 1020 pm, I was on my deck watching the sky when one orange light, just like the original 8 we  saw earlier this evening, came up from the west horizon and floated up and eastbound, more toward Hilliard, a suburb northwest of Columbus.   This was followed by a second orange light maybe 20 seconds later and following about the same path as the first.  These both faded as they went upward as if they were going into the clouds. This evening was partly cloudy, it had rained earlier in the day.  The temperature was around 76 degrees.  There were a lot of private fireworks going off as this is the weekend following the 4th of July.   Our first sighting was at dusk and the second was dark.   This is an area that is northeast of Wright Patterson AFB.  We also have Rickenbacher close to the sighting area- it was a former AFB.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Ohio light sighting.;2013-08-04 01:58:00;5 seconds;Ohio light sighting. I was staring into the clouds/sky and a light appeared, not unlike a star, but exceptionally bright for a star and appearing relatively close.   Within a second or two it shot across the sky in a straight line and vanished at an alarming rate of speed.  There was no sound or boom.   It was unnaturally fast.  It was like nothing I have ever seen before.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Round orange object spotted over Columbus Ohio;2013-09-14 22:14:00;4 minutes;Round orange object spotted over Columbus Ohio My daughter spotted an orange light moving east to west, and told us to look at what she was seeing.  It was a dark orange color, round in shape, about 45 degrees up in the sky, and looked to be about the size of Jupiter as it appears to the naked eye.  It moved to a location that was just west of north and seemed to stop.  Then it slowly faded away. It did not get obscured by clouds, it seemed to just disappear.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Erratic Light Moves Across Sky and Stops Overhead.;2014-06-16 21:30:00;30 minutes;Erratic Light Moves Across Sky and Stops Overhead. I saw a tiny white dot come across the sky from low on the horizon as it were a plane or a star.  It was silent and slowed to a stop a few degrees southeast of the field I was in and appeared to drift rapidly from side to side, speed up, and slow down moving rapidly in different directions at a very high altitude.  It continued moving from east to west in an erratic manner far above the clouds with no jet trails or sound.  The object would appear to stop and then dart rapidly as it were moving very fast but over a very small arc less than a tenth of a degree.  It gradually seemed to drift south of me from east to west but approached the area I was in more rapidly slowing almost to a stop.  It was partly cloudy and there were no stars in the sky.  The sun had set half an hour before. It was around 9:45 PM. At one point it was moving so slowly I thought it might be moving in the opposite direction it came but there was definitely a subtle and rapid darting from side to side.  I noticed nothing else in the sky that seemed to reflect or emit light at the time.  The dot may have had a slightly yellowish tint.  What was unusual was that it seemed to approach the field I was in very rapidly as though it were a plane traveling in one direction and once it were about three or four degrees southeast of me it stopped and drifted very slowly darting around erratically but subtly.  I got tired of watching it as it moved slowly south and west from me continuing the erratic darting and slowing as it were not moving quickly enough across the sky for me to watch it go to the horizon.  I could not identify the object.  It could have been a satellite or space station or something not extraterrestrial, but what was unusual was that it had slowed and stopped a few degrees from where I was and darted around.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Two slow Moving Light Ball in Columbus Sky.;2014-08-23 20:52:00;2 minutes;Two slow Moving Light Ball in Columbus Sky. Was standing outside talking to my mom & some neighbor kids.  One of the kids said look a meteor.   I looked up, it was moving way to slow to be a meteor or any kind of object falling from space.   I popped my camera phone into action and recorded about 1:19 worth of video.  No sound, no flashing or beacon type lights, no mechanical sounds.  The two lights balls just moved slowly down.   One object cut off its lights but you could still see some type of outline which was hard to see.   The second ball of light went black as well.   I lost contact.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Two consecutive pairs of lights drop quickly from high altitude then disappear on a horizontal path.;2014-09-28 19:50:00;10 minutes;Two consecutive pairs of lights drop quickly from high altitude then disappear on a horizontal path. In far distance west of Columbus, two lights appeared to be descending rapidly toward where the sun had just set.  The lights converged and became one light, then fading out more and more, with two lights appearing again.  Then two more lights descended rapidly on the same trajectory.  The lights became less bright as the first two lights had done.  My impression is that the objects were descending vertically, but then quickly transitioned to a horizontal flight path, and at a very high speed continued westward.  It will be interesting to read whether others saw this in states just west of Ohio. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I am a credible professional on sales here in Columbus, with a wife and two children under two.  This morning, around 5:45 am, I am outside with the dog for his morning bathroom routine.  Noticed very bright light in the sky.  Assumed it was an airplane.  Noticed that there was no sound, however.   Light remained stationary for a few seconds, then the light seemed to move vertically skyward and away southeast.  I kept my eyes fixed on the light until it completely disappeared.  It looked as though the light went from very close and bright to nothing more than a very distant star, to nothing at all.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Amber Lightballs, six in series, spaced about two minutes apart track across sky at relatively low altitude and airspeed.;2015-09-20 21:30:00;10 minutes;Amber Lightballs, six in series, spaced about two minutes apart track across sky at relatively low altitude and airspeed. Myself and a friend were sitting outside and we saw an amber light (ball) appear on the horizon, it was low, perhaps 5000 feet, no noise whatsoever, and traveling at the speed which one could say was similar to a small high performance prop aircraft, faster than a helicopter but not real real fast.  We watched it track closer and it took a gradual curve and we watched it as it slowly disappeared on the far horizon.  We then saw a second one, originating at the same point as the first one, it too followed a similar path. Subsequently, there were 3 or 4 more, and at one point we had eyeballs on two of them as one was fading and another had started.  I'm gonna say each one from start to finish was about two minutes. My friend lives in a neighborhood with curving streets all over so unfortunately I cannot give you an orientation as to North/South etc., as I'm not sure the exact direction where they first manifested since I have no clue as to which way the backyard faces. Note, there are a few similar reports.  Very interesting. No noise whatsoever. The color was almost exactly like a street lamp, the amberish ones.

I just got off work and i started heading to the gym, i am about fifteen minutes away when i look up because i was checking to see if the street light was going to change when i see these 4 lights moving along the sky, so i look for other lights around them because maybe it was few helicopters or something,  when i really started to look at these lights traveling together in this kind of square formation, i could tell they were not helicopters, i really wanted to get it on video so i pulled over and started filming i got maybe 3 second of the light of the bottom right end of the square, as they moved along the sky, each corner, right and left both seem to kind of move into one another and then it was just two lights moving and fading away,as they moved i look behind and 4 more are coming over the building to my right, they kind of just went in a straight line in the same direction as they previous 4 as they faded away 4 more from the same direction foll! owed suit.   i called my friend to tell him what i was witness, when another person was walking through the parking lot, looking up, i asked if she was seeing this.  To make sure i wasn't going crazy, she said yes and we stood and watched.  One of the most amazing things i have ever seen.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Strange red and white lights, single object, over Columbus, Ohio 6/27/16;2016-06-27 23:00:00;5 minutes;Strange red and white lights, single object, over Columbus, Ohio 6/27/16 It was a single flying object that I saw (as I came outside from the front door at 11pm 6/27/16 in Columbus, Ohio) when I thought I saw was a satelite. (It was traveling SW.) However this was different.  I could only see 2 very close lights together, one RED the other White, of equal intensity (no actual shape unfortunately).  There was no blinking. They were rather bright so I thought maybe it was a helicopter.  It suddenly stopped its motion and just hovered, absolutely motionless.  Then it quickly reversed from its original direction with great acceleration and then stopped again 3 seconds later.  (There was no spot light from it ever.) It did this for a few minutes and then quickly flew north.  All motion was very angular and when it hovered, which is unlike normal helicopters.  I couldnt make out any sound, but there was a lot of background noise being by the highway.  It was a clear night sky.  No other strange phenomenon occured.  I hope someone else saw it too.  Or could tell me what it was!;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
I saw a total of three lights moving north to south with the city of Columbus till they disappeared.;2016-11-14 19:00:00;10 minutes;I saw a total of three lights moving north to south with the city of Columbus till they disappeared based on distance and the light dimmed slowly as they moved away.  The first two lights moved about the same speed the third light was much slower and was in a different flight path to the left of the first two.  The second light I noticed  was followed by a flash of light in its path but further behind it.  These three lights all appeared to be similar to what you'll see when watching a satellite Passover, except for the flash of light which to me is still unexplainable.  I saw the same type flash on a light two mornings ago moving west to east over the north end of the Columbus.   My neighbor was with me this evening and witnessed the third light I saw within the 10 mins I was outside looking at the night sky.  I've never seen so many things going on in a short period of time like this.

My neighbor and I were sitting in his front yard located near the Westgate area of Columbus, Ohio when I noticed a golden orange light.;2018-07-13 22:30:00;~5 minutes each;My neighbor and I were sitting in his front yard located near the Westgate area of Columbus, Ohio, when I noticed a golden orange light traveling west just to the south of our location.  I thought it was a jet making its approach to Columbus International Airport as I normally see them do. As it reached a position nearly due south of us, it turned north (as jets typically do to make their final approach to the airport).  When it cleared the trees, it was obvious this was no jet.  It was a steadily glowing orange object, no sound, no blinking lights and no sign of navigational lights.  This is when I called my friend's attention to it. We watched it reach an angle of about 60 degrees in altitude from where we were standing, it stopped and hovered, emitting a bright and steady orange glow.  There was no beam as typically seen from a helicopter search light, just the steady, unchanging glow. After hovering for about 10 seconds, it began to slowly move back southeastward and the glow gradually dimmed until it was just a faint speck.  After it disappeared, we sat back down and tried to find a logical explanation for what we just saw. It was about 2 minutes later, it reappeared again coming north almost straight toward us.  Once it cleared the trees, it  stopped and hovered near the same location for about 10 seconds before nearly retracing its path in a south-southwest direction and dimming till we lost sight of it. This occurrence being between 10 and 11PM, the neighborhood was very quiet so it was easy to discern that there was no sound created by the object.  There were no other lights on it, it did not leave a trail.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

White, yellow, and orange orb of light flying at rapid pace and hovering.;2020-07-30 21:30:00;20 seconds;White, yellow, and orange orb of light flying at rapid pace and hovering. Around 9:30pm our neighbors a few houses down set off hundreds of fireworks in the span of 4-5 minutes.  The fireworks were too small to see over the tree-line and sounded like gunshots so we went outside to check it out.  Walking back inside and see a small white light appear in the sky.  Over the span of 5 seconds it covers 5+ miles and comes within 2 miles and is now a large white/yellow/orange orb hovering in the sky.  The UFO watches the commotion for 15 seconds, turns right, accelerates and vanishes into nothing. Multiple witnesses and certainly not an effect from the fireworks.  The airport is 5.5 miles from my house and we can see planes fly in and know what they look like.  This was not a plane, helicopter, or drone.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Line of lights in western sky above Columbus, OH;2020-12-03 19:45:00;~1 minute;Line of lights in western sky above Columbus, OH At around 7:45 PM on 12/4/2020 in Columbus, OH, near the area of Morse Rd. and I-71, two of us witnessed a line of lights to the west.  They appeared about the size that Venus appeared at the same time, and seemed to be a little less bright, or at least more yellow to the color.  No other structure could be seen associated with the lights.  They appeared to be almost perfectly, equally spaced from each other, forming a perfectly straight line staring from lower left to upper right, making roughly a 45 degree angle with the horizon.  This is a rough estimate, but I would say they were located maybe between 15 and 30 degrees above the horizon.  As far as distance from where we were standing, it was very hard to gauge, but my best guess would be between a few miles to maybe 50 miles.  The person I was with pointed them out to me, and we watched them for about a minute, as they appeared to be moving slightly towards us, then slightly north, maintaining the same ! formation the entire time.  Then, just as they appeared to move north, they started to fade out and not be visible anymore, starting with the lights at each end of the line.  It almost appeared that they were turning and the lights were no longer facing us, but they did not reappear as I observed for about 20 minutes afterwards, so I think they just faded/turned off.  The movement was not along the direction of the line, but was perpendicular to the line.  The movement was also very slow, in fact I was not even sure that the line was moving at all until it moved slightly to the north.  I read your requests to not report the SpaceX Starlink satellites, and I don’t believe that is what I saw.  I looked it up afterwards and did find a number of stories referring to people sighting these strings of lights.  However, the ones I saw appeared to be cloud-level, not moving along an orbital path, and the angle in relation to the ground would not make sense for where they were in the sky, but I can not completely discount this possibility.  My friend suggested a group of drones, but I can not really see that as the formation remained equally-spaced and along a line for the entire encounter.  The weather conditions were fairly calm at the ground, but even so they would have to be pretty high-end to keep such a tight formation.  I am generally a skeptic of such sightings (not a non-believer though), but the location in the sky, the formation, and the pattern of movement all leave me with no solid explanation at the moment.  I have a degree in physics, so I am generally aware of the possibilities outside our planetary sphere, and I have spent plenty of time stargazing, so this really did make an impression on me to start looking this far into it.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
