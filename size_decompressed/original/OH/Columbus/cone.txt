Stationary object moving in and out of view at dusk.;2017-06-25 20:10:00;5 minutes;Stationary object moving in and out of view at dusk. Columbus, OH, June 25, 2017, 8:10 PM  See attached drawing. Object faded in and out of view three times.  Visible from 10 to 15 seconds each time.  At first, I thought I was seeing a cloud pass in front of the object but there were no clouds or fog between me and the object.  While visible, the object was not moving.  However, each time it would appear again it was in different portions of the sky, probably a mile distant from the position it was in maybe thirty seconds before.  It almost appeared to be an object that was somehow able to cloak itself from view but the mechanism for cloaking was slipping momentarily out of service.
