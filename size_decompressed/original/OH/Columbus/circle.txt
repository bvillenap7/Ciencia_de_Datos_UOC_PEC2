Within less than 10 min we saw 4 more moving in the same direction,but then slowed to almost a complete stop and then went 90 degrees west.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

I went outside to take out the trash.I observed a metalic circular object in the sky west of my home .It first appeared to be a chromed baloon but for some reason I decided to watch it for a minute.It seemed to have controlled flight,moving and stopping as it seemed to be obsevring something.I noticed it was getting closer and was way too small to be a baloon.It also seemed to have reflective qualities that were distorted.The reflections changed shape but the object did not change shape.It seemed to hover at a distance I guessed to be a half mile up and a half mile away.I was not sure if I was being observed but the object seemed to get closer to me and hold its position.I got a seat and focused on the object and did not look away except for occasional blinking.The wind was blowing about 5 miles an hour but the object did not move as I was using treetops to pinpoint its position in the sky.I could not see and heat waves of propellers visable so I ruled out a propulsion stabilizing system.

I was traveling north to south on the West outerbelt of Columbus, Ohio, heading for the Roberts road exit.  The day and time I'm sure of (Thursday - 12:50 PM).  I could see an object traveling south to north (just off the outerbelt) heading my way.  It was a cloudy, gray day. The object was not traveling at a great speed, and it was only probably two hundred yards in the air.  My first reaction was to pull off to the side of the road, but I immediately realized the object would be out of sight by that time.  The object was round, and doomed and very dirty looking. What stuck in my mind for several days was the object reminded me of a picture I had seen several times, years back, on TV.  My reaction to the picture on TV was This round, doomed, dirty looking, fakey looking object is suppose to be a UFO.  No way.   I wonder now.  Because it was 12:50 Pm and the outerbelt was crowded, their had to be hundreds of cars that saw the same thing I did.  But they probably were heading to or from work, or had other business, and brushed off the object like I did.  The object did look like what I always pictured a UFO not to look like.  Just curious if anyone else from Columbus reported the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Blue Circle/Flame shooting across sky;2002-07-26 01:07:00;1/2 second;Blue Circle/Flame shooting across sky Ok this is the first sighting i incounterd, the second one i previously posted. First off I want to emphasize that the date of the encounter is of to my best recolection, i do not want anyone to downplay my sighting due to the fact that it is similar to the one in washington on the same date and time.As in the second sighting The first sighting occured when i was in the hot tub at my appartment complex. I was not facing directly east but more of a north east direction. Then a intense aqua blue ball came out of no where, traveling at speeds that i have never witnessed. I called into the hotline and the person there suggested that it was a meteor.... I find it impossible to belive This was not a meteor for several reasons. The first reason is that it was traveling on the horizon in a straight trajectory, also it was moving rapidly up and down, similar to a hearbeat on a computer screen only FAST!. Secondly it was a color that simply put does not exist, it was like that of a blue jet flame, only pulsating and mesmorizing,deep and rich yet light at the same time. Another reason i find it hard to belive that it was a meteor or for that matter a shooting star is that it was obviously inside the earths atmosphere, i mean it was like right there, I looked at the stars shortly after the encounter and they seemed extremly far away, compared to the object(s) which was clearly inside our atmosphere. Also one very very very important detail, both of these sightings occured in one peice of the night sky, there are two trees that block out some of the sky to the north and west and there is a strip of sky directly east that you can look out into from the hottub. Both of these objects seemed to only appear in this strech of eastearn sky, they both would ethier shoot across the strip of sky and disapear, or they where moving so fast that by the time my eyes set on the part of visible sky (to the north) the objects where gone. Sorry for reporting this so late, i was scared to death....and still am about what i saw, i was! nt suppo sed to see it, i didnt want to say anything to anyone about it for fear that it was something highly secretive, but since others have seen similar things i thought i would share my experiance.… ((NUFORC Note:  Date apparently is approximate.

Shooting ball of brilliant white light;2002-08-01 00:45:00;1/4 second;Shooting ball of brilliant white light In the past 10 days i have witnessed two sightings, both of which i am extremly paroniod about. I do not know what I saw, only i have a very unerving felling that i saw something that i was not supposed to see. #2) The second sighting occured roughly 3 days ago, I was sitting in the hot tub at my apartment complex and looking eastward into the night sky. In a 1/4 seconds time a ball of shining white light shot north east and dissapeard. I only observed this object for a 1/4 of a second but As I will explain agian in my next sighting report, i got the very strange felling i saw something i was not supposed to see..

behind the clouds and high speeds involved.;2002-10-17 23:01:00;approx. 2 mins;behind the clouds and high speeds involved. 4 circuler objects behind the clouds. Would meet in center then would go off into four circular directions leaving a trail. They would return to the area again and pause for approx. 10-15 seconds and repeat same procedure over. This lasted approx. 2-4 minutes and they then started to do same circular pattern but instead of returning to area (middle) they left in four different directions. Very excessive speed was involved with each movement. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that advertising lights would be the first possible explanation to be elimated, in this case.

Shiny metallic ball observedThanksgiving day over Columbus, Ohio;2006-11-23 14:30:00;2 minutes;Shiny metallic ball observedThanksgiving day over Columbus, Ohio The skys over Columbus were very clear and sunny on the afternoon of Thanksgiving Day 2006.  I first noticed it while observing a large, high flying jet. The jet was flying at an altitude that still allowed its shape to be discernable.  I am not sure if it was a commercial or military jet.  The jet was laying out quite a good con-trail, (that's what caught my attention.) The jet was traveling from east to west/southwest.  Then I noticed the object. It appeared to be at the approximate same altitude as the jet, and perhaps within a quarter of a mile from the jet. Its relative position to the jet was rearward and to the left, (from my perspective). I brought it to the attention of the other two people with me.  It appeared to be stationary. It was round in shape, metallic. It was very silvery and shiny. It remained stationary, and then after a short time, it began to pace the aircraft.  But, the jet slowly gained distance, as the UFO was traveling at a slower speed.  It remained off to one side and rearward of the aircraft as it moved.  I had enough time to gain access to my garage and retrieve a pair of binoculars.  I observed the object through binoculars for perhaps 30 seconds. It was definately round, perhaps ball-like.  I was able to definately observe that there were no wings or other protrusions.   On what would appear to be the bottom were two lights.  One was large and white and very bright.  I mean very bright! The other was much smaller and red.  The shape was very discernable through the binoculars, and WAS NOT AN AIRPLANE OR JET!,  It was round.  It could have been a disc, but it really seemed to be ball-like orb...at least from my viewing position.  Total time viewed was at least two minutes.  Then it was no longer in sight.  I cannot describe its departure.  We could just no longer find it in the sky.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Shining Craft seen in the Columbus, Ohio area. Round in shape no noise about 5000ft above tree level.;2006-12-10 12:45:00;2 minutes;Shining Craft seen in the Columbus, Ohio area. Round in shape no noise about 5000ft above tree level. At around 1245 on 12.10.06 I walked out on my back porch which faces North to have a cig. The sky was partly cloudy with very clear skies over my home and about 42 degrees. I stepped out to see a DC9 heading in a westerly direction leaving a good trail behind it flying at about 13000ft. above my home.  I looked North to see a Cessna single engine four seater heading in a southerly direction flying at about 2000ft towards Port Columbus Airport.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw a craft coming from the Northeast heading in a Southwesterly direction.  I looked at it to see what airplane company it was because of its low flying about 50000 ft. It was shiny reflecting the sun from the top, no wings, round in shap with no noise.  It was a pretty big craft, almost the size of the DC9 at 13000ft.  I watched it till it sped off quickly into the clouds that were off in the distance to the west.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

I walked outside and looked up and directly above our area was a light, the size of a dime. It was one solid blue light, and made no sound.   It travelled East South East , following 33.   I asked the wife to come out quickly and she saw it as well.  There was no blinking at all and it moved slowly away and then faded rapidly before it left our line of sight.       It was definitely within the atmosphere, below the cloud cover and it was no airplane.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Large formation of 15-20 small white glowing orbs heading northward, vanished.;2013-02-25 05:30:00;30 seconds;large formation of 15-20 small white glowing orbs heading northward, vanished -- my partner was napping on our bed and i came in to plug my cellphone in, and happened to be down close to the floor to find the plug. i looked up out of the window and saw what looked like a BEAUTIFUL formation of white shimmering birds -- i yelled at my partner to sit up & put his glasses on to see. then i looked closer and saw that there were LIGHTS, glowing lights. they were moving NORTH over our building in victorian village, columbus. my partner couldn't see them so we RAN outside to try to find them as they headed over the building. ran all around the block, every which way, and no sign of any of the lights. they were neither in a 'V'-formation or a straight line -- a sort of very intricate inter-woven pattern, diamonds maybe?, that i'd have to see again to describe. strangely enough we'd BOTH seen the exact same thing with 2 other witnesses in a columbus-area grocery store on the day neil armstrong died. looked it up all over the internet & nothing ever explained. (august 25th, 2012). very, very moved by & curious about these lights. would love to know if anybody else has seen them today.

I would like to help the rest of the country wake up to the reality of the unknown objects that are increasingly monitoring (interfering/assisting) more now (for whatever reason). I have phone video (not easy to focus with pulsating object in the sky) and had a few photos that the OSU ASTROLOGERS could not discredit. -the objects in the photos are not from a astrological event -photos need further investigation -not sure who would be the best contact for the in-depth inspection If anyone could provide some asistance on taking It to the next level, I am all ears!;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Blue circle light that hovered, flew left and right, then descended.;2015-05-21 23:00:00;2 minutes;Blue circle light that hovered, flew left and right, then descended. Was on balcony of apartment talking with my boyfriend when i noticed a bright very blue light.  Normally, i would dismiss as a helicopter but have never seen one with such a blue light before.   As we talked, i watched as it slowly descended perfectly straight down then hovered still in the sky.  Then it glided straight and perfect to the right about a half fields distance.  Then it glided perfectly straight to the left in the opposite direction.  Then glided on the same perfectly straight path back to the middle and slowly descended perfectly straight down.  It was a perfect cross it traveled now that i think about it.  As far as I've known, there are no known air crafts that can move so perfectly and at such sharp angles.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

My fiancée and I were sitting on the porch and noticed an odd, orange circle of light cross  the sky to the east of us, heading northeast.  Smaller balls of light detached itself and appeared to be falling from it.   We walked down our outside balcony to follow its path and it suddenly disappeared.  About two minutes later, another craft bearing the same description with little orange flashes dropping from it followed along slowly in the same flight path.   We were able to follow its flight path and watched it, when suddenly, it winked out and was nowhere to be seen.   Both were silent on their flights.   About three minutes after the last disappeared, a CPD helicopter loudly flew in the direction they vanished from.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

When we were watching it, at about 70 degrees from us I saw something unexpected.  A light appeared just to the south of the station.  It looked just like a star had appeared from nothing and lasted maybe 2 seconds.  I didn't say anything about it, thinking I would tell my wife later.  About 5 seconds later it appeared again.  Same thing, looking like a star and lasting about 2 seconds before disappearing again. Again I didn't say anything. Then my wife says did you see that light.  She said she saw it twice, just the same as I witnessed it.  It was about 1 inch distance if you took a ruler to measure it the sky, south of the station. I don't know what it was, it just blinked on and then off twice.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

In the sky, there was an incredibly bright, white, spherical light, and as I got a good look at it, I reasoned out that it was not a helicopter (Believe me, I wanted to think it was simply a helicopter with its lights on.) Just as I spoke up to get my father to look, the light minimized until it was a pinprick in the sky, and moved away so quickly that I could not follow it.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
