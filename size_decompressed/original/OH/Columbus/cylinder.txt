MIB appear to discount sighting by 10 people. walked out of home with companion.  companion says to look at strange lights in sky.  appear to be 2 huge almost parallel flourescent tubes in sky (spread arms three feet across field of vision, lights thousands of feet off of ground)of off white light color.  this set of lights blinks off after about 10 seconds.  companion and i ask if we both saw same thing.  then we both notice additional groups of almost parallel lights in the sky, but much much higher in the atmosphere.  these lights were light blue and light orange-pink.  got into car and drove down road heading to downtown.  at freeway overpass, stop car to observe the almost complete formation of an octagon in the southern sky.  drove to the headquarters of the local paper (columbus Dispatch)which is opposite the State Capitol Building.  ran into security office and asked for security guards to call someone, get a photographer to shoot the lights in the sky.  security guared thought we were drunk or high.  we went outside and he sent one of his guards to look at what we were reporting.  when the guard's supervisor asked him what he saw, the guard said, there is something out here and it is over the top of the Capitol Building.  security supervisor came out to look at lights and radioed that he wanted the Columbus Police Department notified, and the airport called to ask if they had anything on radar, over downtown.  within several minutes 3 police cars arrive and then a ManIB shows up and tells all of us that this is nothing, just a reflection off of the buildings, or some trick of the weather.  there were 10 people who were seeing these very small light blue and orange-pink lights.  one of the police officers told me that he heard a police report very like this was called in in Chillicothe the night before.  my companion has seen groupings of lights like this the year after our mutual sighting;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Long cylinder shaped UFO sighted along I-70 near Columbus Ohio.;2005-11-29 15:15:00;1 minute;Long cylinder shaped UFO sighted along I-70 near Columbus Ohio. This sighting occured on the east side of Columbus while driving at approx. 3:15pm on Nov 29 2005. I was driving in an area where I had driven on numerous occasions. I was driving on the outerbelt around Columbus (I-270) traveling north. I was comming up to the overpass crossing over I-70 which runs east and west through Columbus. Being the outerbelt is generally speaking circular my perspective of the object was in continual change while I was moving. I looked east along I-70 and noticed a stationary object approx. 1/4 mile from the overpass. It was sitting just above the tree line slightly to the north of I-70. I at first thought that I was looking at a very large waving banner that was attached to something. I had never seen this in that location before. It was very promonent. I quickly realized that I was looking at a solid object that had a rippling appearance moving along its surface, moving from west to east and going around it. The object was sitting parallel to I-70 maybe 50 feet above the trees. It had the appareance of being a long pipe parallel to the ground, being somewhat longer than a tractor trailer rig and maybe 5 feet tall. I slowed down to look at it but couldn't pull over and stop on the overpass because I had traffic comming up on my rear. This is the point where the situation gets really interesting because just beyond the the I-70 overpass is an underpass for a road that parallels I-70 just to its north and as I approach this underpass I notice a dark blue and/or black helicopter with no markings circling the overpass. I assume that the chopper can see the object but looking straight east now I can no longer see it. From this perspective I would now be looking at it's west end. I at this point look into my rear view mirror and see a dark blue sedan of matching color right behind me. It appeared to be a current model unmarked Chevy Impala that had a beacon on top.(the beacon wasn't on and may have been some type of detection equipment for all I know) The beacon and it's lenses and the windows of the car matched the color of the car so it's interior could't be seen. As I passed under the road crossing over I-270 the sedan pulled over and stopped under the underpass that the helicopter was circling. I must comment about the synchronistic aspects of this happening. This was my third non disk shaped close UFO encounter but the only one I have reported.(the other two encounters were actually closer as I was right under them) I have had four other encounters with the black helicopters but had nothing to do with UFO's. I appeared to be the focus of their attention. At the time of this happening I was scheduled to go to the UFO conference three days later in Virginia beach at the A.R.E.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Bright white cigar/cylinder above columbus OH  4/03/2012  daytime sighting;2012-04-03 19:15:00;10 min;bright white cigar/cylinder above columbus OH  4/03/2012  daytime sighting Tuesday April 3rd 2012. I was outside on a break at work, it was about 7:15pm.  Weather was perfect, bright blue sky with hardly a cloud to be seen.  Upon exiting the building I looked to the sky, as I usually do (I’m fascinated with looking up, watching airplanes, looking at stars etc.) I noticed two planes very high heading west, one behind the other and a little offset.  I watched for a few seconds and turned my attention to my phone to do a bit of web surfing.  After a couple of minutes I again looked toward the sky, but this time I was in for a surprise! When I looked up, I saw something I can’t explain.  There was a bright white object. The shape was somewhere between a cigar and a cylinder.  Actually, it looked like a pill capsule.  Take the fuselage of a plane, remove the wings and tail and cap both ends with a dome.  That’s what I saw. I was on the east side of Columbus, OH and fairly close to the airport. Keep in mind, it was broad daylight when this occurred.  The “object” was traveling from south to north in much the same way a blimp might travel. (silently gliding across the sky)  The altitude was really not that high, I’m guessing around 5’000 ft. It was low enough to see that it did not have wings, and that it was not a blimp, but it was just a little too high to see any clear detail. (as in windows , doors etc.) A pair of cheap binoculars would have revealed something I’m sure.  That’s how close it was. I watched the object pass over as it headed north.  I’m guessing it was about a half mile east of my position. Hard to tell though because I don’t know the true size of said object.  From my perspective I’d say the size was somewhere between a private jet, and a commercial airliner.  The moment was very surreal. I just watched in amazement. I did think about taking a picture with my phone, but I knew the picture would only reveal a small white blob in the sky, and wouldn’t prove anything… I would be made fun of by friends when trying to show it. In hindsight however, I wish I had taken that picture!  The object continued heading away from me to the north, and after I had my fill of watching it, I again returned to surfing the web. (I knew I had just witnessed something extraordinary, but there was nothing else to see)  After reading a couple articles in the news I decided it was time to go back inside. I took one more look to the sky, and low and behold, there it was again! It seemed to be on the same trajectory, only this time, it was headed back to where it came. (south) I couldn’t believe it. I watched for a few seconds and decided I needed a witness. I went back inside, and yelled for one of my co-workers. I told him to hurry, you’ve gotta see this. We were back outside in about 15 sec. I pointed to the sky and said “What the **** is that?!!”  He was without words. I had him confirm what I saw.  Me:  “do you see wings?”   Him: “no”   Me: “is it a blimp?” Him: “no”  Me: “what do you think it is?”  Him: “I don’t know” We watched it head further to the south for maybe 30-40 sec. and then it changed course a bit and headed roughly south east and then accelerated (gradually, but firmly) off into the distance. Im very glad I called for him. I have no idea what I witnessed. I very much like looking to the sky, and I do every time I go outside. I live in the flight path of Port Columbus and I am accustomed to seeing different types of planes as they come in to land. I’ll admit I’m no aviation expert, but like I said I’ve always been fascinated by flight, and I watch planes every chance I get. I love to read about the mysteries of this earth, and in doing so, I have read enough to also be a very skeptical person. However, this is one thing I cannot explain.  To me this was truly an Unidentified Flying Object. From where it came, I do not know, but I am very glad to have witnessed it. I have searched online every day since and have come up with nothing. Surely somebody saw it, and I would like to hear other accounts.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Tuesday morning July 25,2017 at approximately 8:45am in the morning with a clear blue and beautiful sky while driving west bound on Hop;2017-07-25 08:45:00;5-7 minutes;Tuesday morning July 25, 2017, at approximately 8:45am in the morning, with a clear blue and beautiful sky, while driving west bound on Hopkins Rd. in Columbus, Ohio, my wife asked me what is that in the sky.   I slowed down from 30mph to 10mph to watch what I call a air vessel three times the size of a Boeing 777, white in color with red rear fin, but the aircraft didn't have any wings, and made no sound.   The aircraft then headed east towards downtown Columbus, Ohio.   I am a US Air Force combat veteran of 12 yrs and I have never seen a aircraft like this.  It had no markings, decals or country designation.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
