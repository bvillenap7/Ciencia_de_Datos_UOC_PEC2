Got off work at 1:30 a.m.  Me and friend drove a couple miles down the road, I looked out my passenger side window and saw a big craft.  Realizing its chevron head shape with rectangular body -->.  It had lights on each edge and some scattered on the body making it well lit.  It was relatively close so i could make the ufo out very well.  My friend and I stared in awe as it turned away from the parallel path we were both going on.  He sped up and we turned on another street to follow but we could only keep it in view for about a minute and a half or so before loosing site of it over Riverside Hospital.  We spotted this craft over Upper Arlington in Columbus, Ohio.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

I saw a bright light in the distance and it slowly came closer, I think it was moving about 200 mph at best guess.  It was at least 25,000 feet up and several miles, from my position when I first saw it.  I watched it til I could determine that there were no blinking lights on it indicating it was a plane.  It came from NW of the city and flew over the upper northeast portion of town.  I was able to see it clearly for about two minutes at it's closest point to my house, when it banked slightly and I could see 5 lights and the bottom of a chevron shaped craft.  I watched it for another two minutes as it continued to travel in a ESE direction.  It faded from sight in the distance ... I would like to be informed if anyone else reports thisâ€¦;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
