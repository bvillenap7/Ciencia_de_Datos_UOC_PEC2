I saw the Three Red Lights back in the 70's.;1970-11-15 20:00:00;1 hour;I saw the Three Red Lights back in the 70's. I saw the same three lights durring a UFO rash in about 1970, that were seen of late. They were off at a greater distance and dancing around one another in the nite sky. I ran in the house and called 0 (before 911) and was put right through to Port Columbus tower. I dont know if they still do that but apparently thats how it was done in the day. The guy in the tower claimed he couldnt see anything but I could tell he was pulling my leg. So I said Come on man! Are you telling me you cant see those things? he said Yes we can see them but we dont know what they are. My older brother was with me at the time. I tried to get my dad to come out but he would not. We had a run in with some UFO's a few years before and he didnt even like to talk about it. I sent you the details on that one and asked you not to publish it if I remember right. Do you remember I sent you info about a year or better ago about seeing a ship up close with little ones coming out of it and taking off in several directions? The cops were there as well as many witnesses. Men came to the house and told my dad to shutup about it. I mead we were less that 125ft from this deal and it didnt care who were watching! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  The witness may be addressing the event that occurred over Ohio in October 1973, although that is only a guess on our part.

Silent round black object moving opposite the wind direction - Columbus, OH;2008-01-31 15:50:00;5 minutes;Silent round black object moving opposite the wind direction - Columbus, OH My observation was made at 3:50 PM, 1-31-2008  I was outside my workplace taking a break, when I saw what I thought was a large black balloon drifting overhead.  The object was traveling directly overhead at a slow speed (< 25 MPH) from the northeast to the southwest in the direction of downtown Columbus.  I would guess that the altitude was around 1500 –2000 ft.  The object was moving in a very straight line, with no changes in direction that I could tell.  There was no sound, and no lights.  I thought this was odd, because my location is approximately 3 miles due west of Port Columbus (Ohio) International Airport, in-line with the runways.  Planes are regularly approaching or taking off directly overhead, all day, everyday.  Today they have been on the approach path.  Adding to my concern was the realization that the wind was blowing the opposite direction that the object was moving. See below a copy of the National Weather Service report for Columbus, OH that I cut and pasted below.  This is the first time I have ever seen something like this that didn’t have a rational explanation.   	31° Overcast	Feels Like27° 	Reporting Station: KCMHRelative Humidity: 33%Wind: 70° (ENE) at 8mphGusts: 0mphPressure: 30.3inYesterday's Precip: inYesterday's Low Temp: 15°FYesterday's High Temp: 46°F	Dew Point: 5°Visibility: 10miCeiling: 9000ftHeat Index: 31°Wind Chill: 23°6hr Precip: in6hr Low Temp: 16°F6hr High Temp: 28°F  Raw Report Data: KCMH 311951Z 07007KT 10SM OVC090 M01/M15 A3031 RMK AO2 SLP276T10061150;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

I was on the on-ramp to I-270 east from I-23 on the south end of Columbus, as I was rounding the on-ramp, I looked off to the west and saw a bright white spherical object traveling at about a 45 degree angle into the night sky, this object made no noise, it was moving faster than anything I had ever seen, it left a light trail behind itself a short distance that seemed to have an almost animated glow.   suddenly the object accelerated and shot out of sight like a bullet.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
I saw a white object with a black side in the air in the morning that dissapeared.;2008-11-04 08:03:00;4 seconds;I saw a white object with a black side in the air in the morning that dissapeared. It was a some what warm morning.no clouds,clear skies,calm wind.  I was in a bus that was taking a turn around a bend.  I was able to notice that there was a bright object in the sky it seemed to be making its own light, as all of the object was lighted evenly.It was a sphere which had a slight black curve on the side.  It also seemed to have a small thing sticking out of it like an antenna.  The object was about 3,000ft above the ground and 1 mile away.  After about 2 seconds.  The object then dissolved into the sky.It seemed to turn invisible.  Like it knew I was watching it.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
slow moving metallic orb in sky stopping in mid flight and then changing direction;2009-04-23 13:45:00;10 minutes;slow moving metallic orb in sky stopping in mid flight and then changing direction I was at work on Thursday April 23 and stepped outside for my afternoon break.  While outside I noticed 3 super stallion military helicopters fly over heading east.  After the helicopters left my field of sight I noticed a small light slowly moving north.  It appeared to be a shiny metallic and was reflecting the sunlight off of it.  As I watched the object it suddenly stopped.  After sitting still in the sky for approximately 1 minute, the object headed west at the same slow pace.  I noticed that the object was not only reflecting the sunlight but it was also appearing to be slowly pulsing a white light.  The object abruptly stopped again for about 3o seconds to 1 minute and continued on the same path.  I did have my video recorder with me and tried to get video of the object.  I could not get any solid video of the object moving because the sun prohibited me from observing the object through my LCD screen. Later that evening I did review the video and I did manage to capture several small bits of video showing the object.  I did obtain some still pictures of the object and one picture clearly shows a small metallic orb in the sky.  It seemed to have some sort of haze (energy?)surrounding it.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Rapidly moving night time sphere object, heading north with no lights or strobes or sound.;2011-11-06 18:02:00;25 seconds;Rapidly moving night time sphere object, heading north with no lights or strobes or sound. I often sit outside to have a cigarette and enjoy looking at the night sky. It started getting dark about 30 minutes prior to my going outside tonight.  The skies are clear and the moon is about half full and brightly lit.  While looking up at about 6:02 pm, I noticed a spherical object moving North at a very rapid speed and the only light from object seemed to be from the moonlight only.  It appeared faintly lit by the moon's light only and had no flashing or strobe lights and faded into the northern sky.  It also appeared to move in a straight line heading north.  There also was no sound coming from the object.  Our Columbus (Ohio) International Airport is also about 2 miles North from the sighting location.  Maybe their radar picked it up?;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Orange object with tail moving across night sky from north to south;2012-08-01 22:10:00;10 seconds;Orange object with tail moving across night sky from north to south I live in Columbus, Ohio.  At 10:10 p.m. tonight (August 1, 2012) I was taking out the trash container to the street.  It was dark.    I noticed an orange object up in the sky, moving quickly from north to south at a steady pace.  It was not a planet, like Venus or Mars it was much bigger than that, and was not a shooting star.   The object looked round, but it shimmered, like maybe it was spinning around.     It also had a distinct orange tail that came to a point, which made it look a bit like a rocket.   There was no debris trail after it, as a comet or a shooting star might have.    Anyway, it moved across the sky in about 10 seconds, and disappeared over the horizon.    Maybe it was some space junk burning up in the atmosphere?;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Orb in the night sky that accerated very fast;2012-08-08 02:30:00;8 seconds;Orb in the night sky that accerated very fast It was 2:30am I was on my balcony smoking. I looked up at the stars as I do late at night.  Then I noticed a &quotStar&quot that looked very bright and was kinda an orangish red.  It was not a planet or star though and it wasnt a high flyin jet. I can see high flying jets at night they blink on each wing this thing didnt blink at all.  As I was looking at this weird &quotStar&quot it started to move slow at first but then accelerating to a speed that I thought was very fast since it was over the horizen in just under 5-6 seconds. I only wish i had had time to get my video camera.  I look in the same spot of the sky every night since then at the same time an have not seen it since.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Orange shimmering object moving across night sky;2012-08-18 23:40:00;10-15 seconds;Orange shimmering object moving across night sky Last night I saw another shimmering orange object in the sky.  I already reported on one that I saw on August 10.    On this occasion, I went outside to lock my car and the object caught my eye.   It was moving from east northeast to west southwest.   It was not falling like a shooting star, but moving horizontally.  Unlike the first sighting, this one had no trailing “cone” shape behind it, but otherwise it was identical.   It produced no trail, like a shooting star or comet.   It moved in a straight line fairly quickly, like the speed you would of a plane flying across the sky.   But I have seen planes flying across the night sky with their navigation lights flashing at regular intervals.  This was definitely not a plane.  The object was basically round and orange in color, but it shimmered or flashed but not regularly – the effect was more like it was an irregular shaped object spinning around fairly quickly.   Maybe it would be akin to wrapping aluminum foil around a rock, hang from a string, spin it around, and shine a bright orange light on it.   Anyway, it tracked across the sky and then it gradually diminished in intensity and eventually faded from view.   The whole episode lasted about  10-15 seconds from the time I first spotted it.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Four red/orange orbs move erratically over Columbus, Ohio.;2012-09-23 22:50:00;3 minutes;Four red/orange orbs move erratically over Columbus, Ohio. My wife, her friend and I were outside smoking a cigarette at around 10:50 P.M. when I noticed three glowing orbs moving north to south overhead. We went to the front yard to watch them, and discovered that there were actually four, one having passed the house moments earlier. They were roughly circular, but obviously spherical, like a jellyfish lit from within by an orange/reddish light. My immediate thought was that they were paper lanterns, but as we watched for even two more seconds, several things became apparent. Firstly, despite the lack of any noticeable wind at ground level, all four of the objects were moving at an eerily fast rate: they had each passed over the street facing our house and were at least a quarter mile away less than twenty seconds later. Secondly, each object, while grouped relatively close, moved at variable speeds and transcribed smooth arcs and lateral movements that brought them within feet of one another at times (excepting the fourth, which was the first to pass overhead). The glowing objects appeared to dim and wink out as they moved to the middle distance: the entire encounter having lasted no longer than two minutes. Our house is less than two miles from the Columbus airport, and at least one often-used flight plan brings aircraft directly over our house every twenty minutes or so, but these lights could in no way be associated with any airplane that I have seen.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
2 spheres flying in formation;2012-10-03 22:25:00;15 seconds;2 spheres flying in formation I was looking North from my balcony.  2 small spheres appeared from behind a cloud.  There altitude seemed to be between 10,000 to 15,00 feet.  They flew in formation from the northeast to the southwest makeing a slight direction change to fly directly to the west. they were flying very close to eachother one right behind the other, both roughly the same sphere shape and slightly diffrent colors of a greenish orange.  I cant extimate their speed since i didnt have a referance point but they seemed to be going very fast covering the length of the sky in about 15 seconds.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

At one point it seemed to become a little larger and much brighter for about 3 or 4 seconds.   It eventually very slowly sort of floated out of sight.

A ball of light the consistency of plasma, bright as a welding arc, the size of a basketball dancing around a light at the top of a parking lot light, just like a humming bird flitting around a flower.  It stayed spherical but did occasionally slightly change shape like a fragile round balloon in the wind.  That's all it did.  Dance to and fro around the street light.  Just like a quick humming bird! No repeated pattern, just zoom, dart, hold, zoom, dart, hold, over and over, no more than 1 to 2 feet away from the light.  Occasionally, it darted in a straight line in a split second 100 feet out to the right and then flies back, then 50 feet to the left and come back.  It looked controlled somehow, like that hummingbird leaving and then deciding to come back to a flower. Its intensity was like a welding arc.  Intensely Bright!  The sky was pitch dark and the street lights were on at the corner of Morse Road and High Street, Columbus Ohio.  Two of us watched it at 5:00 am for at least 10 minutes 1.5 years ago.  I looked at the other man and said:  Do you see what I see?  Answer:  Yea! Crazy! What is it?!   It was still going strong when I left, and I still am not sure what it was.  Not ball lightning.  Not static electricity dancing because of nearby high voltage.  Clear sky, not lightening. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I went outside this morning at 3 AM EST and saw the main light first.  It is very bright and seems ‘lower’ than I’ve ever seen it.  There are “beams” radiating from it. It moves around slowly and looks like it’s part of a constellation at first.  It is VERY bright.  It is in the western sky. There are four more lights randomly placed in the same western sky.  They are smaller and appear orange.  They move around more noticeably than the centrally located white light. It is now 5:20 AM EST, and they are all still in the sky.  Normally, if I see a moving light it disappears after an hour or so.  Not this time.  I wonder why there is so much activity?;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Totally silent. No usual lights from an aircraft (no blinking tail lights or wing lights)..  just a pink, slowly moving pink sphere heading west to east, slightly low in the sky (35 degrees).   The size and intensity of the light oscillated.. changing from larger sphere to a smaller sphere and then back again.  It shifted from small to large about about 4-5 times.  I watched it for about 60-90 seconds.  It continued in the same direction and eventually faded to a glimmer and then gone.  (Although it did *not* continue 'over the horizon' like a rocket..it continued in a straight line and faded out.
