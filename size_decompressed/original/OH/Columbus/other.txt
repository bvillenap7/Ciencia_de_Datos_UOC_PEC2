No joke, a giant Teddy Bear shaped UFO.;1998-07-15 08:00:00;10 seconds;No joke, a giant Teddy Bear shaped UFO. Okay, this is a strange story but rather funny and I just have to share it. I'm not positive about the exact date or year. But it was the summer of 97 or 98. I was driving northbound to my office in Columbus, Ohio and stopped at my usual fast food place for breakfast. I pulled around the back of the building to the service window. As I stopped at the window I looked up and noticed straight in front of me but maybe a block or two away, a giant (30-40 feet tall)Teddy Bear floating in the sky right above the trees. I thought I was seeing things for a second then realized it must be a hot air balloon although where the basket would be was below the tree tops. It floated past the corner of the building I was next to so I couldn't see it any longer. I laughed and told the cashier what I saw when he waited on me. He stuck his head out the window but it was already out of sight. A few moments later he gave me my order and I drove forward. As I turned around the corner of the building I looked to where the object should be based on it's speed and direction. There was nothing there. Before I pulled back onto the main street I looked all around and up. It had disappeared. Because of the flatness of the area and lack of large trees or tall buildings the only way I could explain it disappearing was if it had crashed behind a home and lost it's air in the short time between when I saw it float past the building and when I pulled up. I listened to the local news that evening to hear if there had been a balloon crash or even a balloon show. Nothing was mentioned. As nutty as this sounds it really happened just as I wrote.

It was just hoovering, over the top of the trees, we looked at it because it look very strange in appearance nothing like I've have ever seen before.  We look that it for about 20 to 25 seconds, then all at once it took off at a great speed, faster than any aircraft could ever move, I've never seen anything move that fast before it was like in a blink of an eye and it was gone.  We looked up in the sky all-around and we saw nothing.  We do believe what we have seen classifies as a U. F. O. unidentified flying object.  Because to Me any aircraft that was in the sky flying would still have been visible to the eye.  In this case there was nothing.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Large black cube shaped UFO spotted Columbus,  OH.  Time seemed to stop!;2003-09-15 00:00:00;5 to 10 minutes;Large black cube shaped UFO spotted Columbus,  Ohio    - Time seemed to stop! I experienced this with my girl friend at the time, but while she admits to me that this happened it seems that this experience really freaked her out. She asked that I not include her in the story. I got home from work, stepped out of my car in the driveway when I heard a resonating vibration sound that seemed to drown out everything else.  I looked due East across the street and about fifty to one hundred feet above the houses was a large black cube sitting in the air.  The craft did not seem to have any lights and it did not move suddenly.   All I could do was stare I thought of taking a picture and the camera was just inside the house, but I couldn’t move. It seemed as if time stopped. The cube was approximately the size of two homes in my neighborhood which would be about 3000sqft total the outer texture like a borg cube on Star Trek.  The cube began to move slowly toward the south directly above the houses and I started to see a very light gray puff of smoke coming from what had become apparent to me was the rear of the craft. There were three light gray exhaust-like openings where the smoke was coming from, but the smoke very quickly dissipated as the craft moved south. I watched until the craft was too small on the horizon to see any longer it was weird how no one seemed to be around except the person traveling with me that day until I could no longer hear the resonating vibration sound. Then when the cube was too far to distinguish, cars began passing by like normal and I saw neighbors coming and going it was as if someone had their fingers in my ears and quickly removed them. I talked about the experience with the person traveling with me that day and their account was exactly what I had experienced. This happened about four to five years ago and I am still getting goose bumps and every hair on my body is standing up while I type this. I had never had anything like this happen before and have not since although I mentally prepare for the next encounter, hoping I can get a picture or video of this cube. Background: I was 25 years old at the time of this experience.  I am a non-denominational Christian and for the majority of my life never believed anything like this would ever happen to me. I figured most UFO sightings were either drug induced or exaggerations. I have held a full time job all my adult life, enjoy my work and am for the most part a happy person.

I took approx. 60 shots of the building.  On one series of shots, I shot four shots from the same angle, but varied them by zooming in and out.  The camera used is a Nikon D100, with a 17mm to 35mm lens.  This lens is one of Nikon's better zoom lenses.  In fact it's the top of the line.  It is not prone to flare.  The digital camera is a 6mp.  On the second of the four shots, there is an object in the sky over the building.  I did not see it at the time of photography, but only noticed it when reviewing the shots.  In fact, there are several objects in the frame, as well as the other frames, but they are so small you wouldn't notice them unless I pointed them out.  None of these objects appear in any other frame, either of this building on any other that I shot that day.   What makes this image so interesting is the fact that  the object  is sun lit at exactly the correct angle.  This is not a plane or bug etc.  I reviewed the info in the camera regarding this frame, and it revealed that the shutter was at a 60th and the f stop at f11.  There is a slight blur of the object, probably due to the slow shutter.  I'm am sending a jpeg to your e-mail address.  please respond.  I would like to know your opinion. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the peculiar object is.  It is so odd, we may post it to our website.  Our first guess was that it might be a bird or insect in motion, but the object appears to have two peculiar objects projecting out of it, which seem incompatible with a terrestrial organism.

Amber fire lantern over midtown Clintonville in Columbus, Ohio hovers for 10 seconds then quickly disappears into the sky;2011-07-13 22:25:00;20-30 seconds;Amber fire lantern over midtown Clintonville in Columbus, Ohio hovers for 10 seconds then quickly disappears into the sky I was driving, heading south when I looked up into the sky around 10:25pm to see what looked like a amber tinted amorphus shape hollow globe with a light eminanting from within it.  It looked like the body of a jelly fish or a fire lantern but not of rigid construction in that the shape was flowing and changing but always stayed hollow.  At one point it looked like a sail was flowing on the top. There was a light situated in the base that changed in intensity, size and color randomly and sporatically.  The glow of the light at the base illuminated the inside of the globe.  It hovered slightly at the altitude of a high flying hot air ballon, floating much like one, slowly accending.  It did not seem to make any mechanical noises.  It did this for about 10 seconds.  The globe then began to ascend up and in a south westerly direction until it was just a redish rising spec and then it disappeared completely up into the night sky. It took less than 10 seconds to ascend to nothingness.  Area is an approach for the Columbus airport but the object was clearly not an airplane.  Airplanes were flying, cicrling for approach even in the immediate vacinity when the object was observed.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Dark colored object moving fast.;2011-10-26 08:30:00;10 minutes;Dark colored object moving fast. I was driving south on Olentangy River Road, as i was driving i noticed something in the sky, it was dark in color and reminded me in the shape of a  large looking tad pole.  I know that sounds strange but it was really weird.   As I kept driving down the road to work it was moving kinda fast.  I at first thought it was a plane pulling a banner, but it was not.  It was a cloudy day sorta then i thought it might some dark clouds, but it was not it was moving and by the time i got to work it was gone.  But it was headed south to the downtown area.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Strange lights over the sky in northwest Columbus;2013-05-19 21:30:00;5-10 minutes;Strange lights over the sky in northwest Columbus Driving home from dinner out, we saw a number of strange lights in the sky over northwest Columbus.  There were a whole bunch, all remaining stationary above the buildings and trees, too bright and low to be stars.  They were a light orange in color.  We were able to see them from several perspectives as we got off I-270 and headed north on Rt. 23.  We couldn't identify them.  If they were all part of one aircraft it would have been huge.  If they were all individual aircrafts there were a lot of them.  Yet they didn't move.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Huge light cluster (possible ufos).;2013-07-20 22:30:00;5 minutes;Huge light cluster (possible ufos) Driving down the road, saw about 12-18 white/red lights forming in a zig-zag formation. All clustered together.  When the white lights went away the red lights replaced them.  The lights stayed in the sky for about 5 minutes.   Following them in the sky was what looked like a helicopter/plane with its search light on pointing right at them.   We got out of the car and ran to see if we could still see them there were only about 4 left then they completely disappeared.   The helicopter/plane with its search light on was the only thing left in the sky.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Object sighted - Columbus, OH 09/24/2013 7:07? – 7:12 am.;2013-09-24 07:07:00;5 minutes;Object sighted - Columbus, OH 09/24/2013 7:07? – 7:12 am. Location: Columbus, OH. North end east of  I71 and west? of Westerville road. North of I270 and south of Polaris parkway. Time: I first saw it around 7:07 am.  When I saw it and for the entire duration of the event it did not appear to move, so it may have been there long before 7:07 am.  It may also have been there after 7:12 am. Description: It was a very bright slightly crescent shaped cylinder with tapering ends when I was observing it from west of its location.  As I moved northwest and then to the north of it it became just a bright dot like I was looking at one end of it.  As I moved to the east of the object it disappeared from sight.  I don’t think it moved, it just wasn’t visible from that direction.  What is odd is that the object was visible with the sun BEHIND it and became invisible when I got to the north and east of it.  That indicates to me that the light wasn’t a reflection of the sun, but something coming from the object itself.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Massive structure with blue lights flying across sky.;2013-11-22 22:30:00;1 minute;Massive structure with blue lights flying across sky Early winter of 2013, I stood out on my front porch to get some fresh air.  It was around 10:30pm.  I looked up to the sky because I saw blue light out the corner of my eye.  It was to the right.  At first I thought it was a shooting star because it was moving so fast.  But as it flew further from me, I saw blue light from the left as well.   That’s when I realized the lights were a part of the same structure.  It appeared to be on the wings of a massive sort of flattened crescent shaped structure.  And I mean massive.  It stretched from one side of the sky to the other.  If it were on the ground, it cover several miles.  I couldn’t see the center and body of it well, but I could see where the lights were.  The wings were thin and very aerodynamic looking.   The body of it was shadowy.  But, I could see the stars through the body of it as if it were kind of transparent.  It was very fast and extremely quiet.  That’s how I know it wasn’t man made.  I’m ex-military and I’ve seen most of what we can do.   Our technology is junk compared to this thing.  We cannot create something so massive and so fast, yet doesn’t make a sound as it zipped across the night sky.   I waited for news reports.  I just knew people were going to report it.  It was so large.  It was fast and there and gone in under a minute, but it was so large that I figured someone else had to see it.  '' I searched the news and internet.  No reports. I only told my kids about it.  I’m reporting this for the first time, and it feels good to tell someone.  I don’t feel so crazy anymore. I saw a similar picture of a UFO on a tv show a few days ago and that prompted me to find this website.  It wasn't the same.  But, close enough to get my attention.   I plan to draw a picture, the best I can, and submit it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

There appeared to be a layered oval shaped cloud at low altitude.  Very unusual sighting, but I did not notice any other objects in the area.  It seemed to just be hanging there and didn't move.  I had to leave the area and when I returned about 1/2 hour later it had gone away. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Soundless  Filmed with still and video cameras Was out photographing the moon, Venus, Mars, and Saturn. While focused on Venus, I saw 2 red lights or objects go past one above and 1 below Venus and about a degree apart.  They were blinking in synchrony.  Saw no body go over Venus, just the 2 lights, west to east.  Took pictures with an iphone. Then ran to a camcorder & turned it on.  I could still see the blinking red lights off and on.  There seemed to be more of them- at least 3 maybe 4.  They would make different patterns. There seemed to be white lights too.  Filmed dancing lights, flashes, move around, sometimes synchronous, blink, changed configuration, soundless, nothing like airplane lights, etc. (Still Photos and Video). They were soundless.  Know what drones, balloons, ad aircraft etc. looks like.  Have photography on Youtube and facebook (but not as good as the originals, but can give URLs).;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Makes me feel as if the bad angel's are released.  My boyfriend seen it as well.  I tried to capture it on my cell but the only thing that showed up was a piece of the light coming from the center of it. I have many photos,  personal dealings and I've never seen this.

A half hour out from Columbus on I70 I spotted two orange lights just sitting there. So I thought maybe a higher pole or something, but it was really high. I tried to figure out what it was for 10-15 minutes before my dad said “hey guys, y’all see those orange lights over there, whats that?” I said maybe a pole, idk I’ve been trying to figure out what it is for about 10 minutes now. He said it was about 1000 to a couple thousand feet in the air and that it couldn’t be a pole. So we watched it for a couple minutes.... which my daughter and nephew at this time saw it..... and then it started moving. The other orange light we thought was moving too but it could have been Mars because later I looked it up. Anyway, it started moving and I grabbed my phone to try and record and it was not moving in a straight line. It was moving all over to where i couldn't really record good.... Keep in mind we were also drivi! ng on a highway, but with my naked eye i could see the it was kinda zig zagging. So then it went over the highway over our van and i saw (with my naked eye) 6-9 orange rectangular lights close together forming a triangle on the bottom of the craft. I also remember seeing a red light towards the end. I have the video and also slowed the video down. And i have also screenshot the still parts i thought you could really see what i saw.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
