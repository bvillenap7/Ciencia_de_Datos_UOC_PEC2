Football field sized gunmetal gray rectangular craft with bright lights and windows hovering silently 100 ft or so above parking lot;1984-08-12 21:00:00;10-15 minutes;Football field sized gunmetal gray rectangular craft with bright lights and windows hovering silently 100 ft or so above parking lot It was 1984 or 1985 (I’m very bad with dates) and I was living with my ex-fiance on the north side of Columbus, Ohio.. We had planned to take a short trip across town to visit my mother that evening, and our only vehicle at the time was his motorcycle. As we mounted the bike in the driveway we looked up and in the distance saw three blinding white lights. They weren't far from the ground two below and one above in a tight triangle configuration. My fiance was in the Air Force at the time and worked at Wright Paterson on the weekends. What the Hell is that? he wondered aloud. It's probably just highbeams on a crane I suggested. We would know soon enough since we had to head in that direction.  We drove for about a mile, all the while my ex was saying What the Hell is that?? Eventually we came close enough to be able to tell that it was too high up to be lights attached to a crane, but they were dead still. Suddenly we noticed that a large rectangular space behind the lights was far darker than the sky around it. My ex yelled WHAT THE FUCK IS IT??!  Then slammed on his brakes as about six African American kids ranging in age from about ten to sixteen dashed in front of our bike. Their eyes were also fixed on the monstrous craft. And it was bloody huge. Not Independence day huge-but easily as large as a football field or larger. It was gunmetal gray like a giant monolithic slab  about the proportions of a thick cereal box or box of cigarettes with slightly raised and depressed geometric shapes of various sizes on it's surface (it was not smooth at all). It hovered over a large empty parking lot that stretched out in front of an abandoned Rink's department stor! e. The road we were on was busy, but I didn't notice if others had stopped to look. The craft had the three painfully bright lights mounted on what looked like it's front. There were smaller amber/ red and bluish green lights underneath it that glowed steadily, and as we kept driving we came around to the back of the craft, which featured three (maybe four) flat, glowing rectangular panels in a horizontal row that were tilted slightly downward. They looked like large observation windows to me, and I felt-or perhaps even saw-figures moving around inside. I didn’t want to see anymore and looked down. My former fiance finally said We have to get closer! and I completely flipped out -and I'm not one who is given to flipping out. He turned the bike toward the craft and I hit him hard and told him that there was no way in hell that he would take me any closer. I was in tears I was so frightened. Just as this was happening the group of boys that had crossed in front of us co! uld be seen running across the expanse of the parking lot towa! rd the a rea under the craft. As they neared it I glanced down for a second time, not wanting to see what was happening,  and as I did I heard my ex exclaim Holy Fuck!! I looked and the kids were standing there, but the craft had disappeared. Ken said that it had shot straight up into the sky at a speed that was simply unbelievable. I begged him to keep driving and we continued on. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although source of report does not indicate that fact.  PD));39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Giant rectangular craft with cloaking technology witnessed;2013-04-09 21:50:00;5 minutes;Giant rectangular craft with cloaking technology witnessed Tuesday, April the 9th, 2013     Around 945-950 PM, I was sitting on my back porch with my mother when our dogs alerted us to a disturbance.  I walked outside of the porch and after looking around the house and only finding a slow moving truck cruising down the street I headed back to the porch.  The sky is very clear tonight and the temperature is nice so I was stargazing. In the southwestern sky I saw three bright white lights very brightly flickering.  Immediately I called for my mother and she quickly joined me in viewing these lights.  They were arranged in a triangular pattern with one of the lights pointed in the direction of north and the two others being relatively close together in the rear.   I then noticed that they were moving very quickly in straight lines.  The movement was far to fast to be an aircraft as it was immediate.  It appeared that the lights were defining the edge line of the craft.  It was completely silent and moved at the speed of a typical jet.  It was traveling south*west to north. As it moved another light appeared and the size of the craft was plain to distinguish from the rest of the sky.  However, the object was exactly the same color as the night sky. It was like a perfect reflection it was as if it was invisible.  As I watched it move and watched the lights move back and worth I could see that it appeared like a gian! t rectangular panel.  The size of the craft was massive. It was only possible to know that the lights belonged to only one craft because as it moved it blotted out stars in the area between the lights.  It continued north (towards Wright Patterson AFB) and as it went further from my location it was possible to hear the sound of its engine.  It was the sound of a jet engine.  This was comforting, as it allowed me to have no fear that this craft was anything otherworldly. My mother and I are medical professionals.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
A rectangular flying object was seen in downtown Columbus, Ohio. The object had an immense glare/light coming from it in broad daylight;2018-07-06 14:50:00;10 Seconds;A rectangular flying object was seen in downtown Columbus, Ohio. The object had an immense glare/light coming from it in broad daylight Walking into work in downtown Columbus, and I noticed a glare from the sky.  I looked up and there was a rectangular like shape flying in the sky.  I thought it was a plane at first glance, but then I realized it was way too far for it to have such a strong glare.  It felt like the object had lights projecting off the sides because it was so bright.  My eyes started watering from how bright it was and I couldn't look away, but I could see that there was no bulging shapes like one would see on a plane.  It was remarkable and then it flew over a building and I could no longer see it.  Easily the most bizarre moment of my life.  Keep in mind, it was almost three in the afternoon with zero clouds in the sky, so this object was almost like an immense mirror flying at a distance.  Zero chance a regular airplane has a glare that makes my eyes water from that distance.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Black rectangle craft, green lights;2019-10-08 03:00:00;.30 seconds;Black rectangle craft, green lights I was up late watching shows on my computer in bed.  I leaned back into my pillow and looked out the window for a brief moment.  There in the sky was some dark rectangular craft in the sky with green lights.  It was fuzzy in some areas because of the clouds breaking against it.  And sharper in other areas.  I blinked a few times then it disappeared.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
