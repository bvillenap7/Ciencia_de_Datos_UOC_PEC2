AT FIRST I THOUGH I SAW A BLIMP WITH LIGHTED ADVERTISING (THE KIND THAT IS COMPUTERIZED) OFF IN THE SKY BUT IT WAS TOO FAR AWAY TO SEE CLEARLY. A UFO WAS THE LAST THING ON MY MIND. BUT AS I STARED AT IT TO SEE WHAT IT WAS  ITSTARTED COMING DOWN TOWARD ME  FROM THE SKY AND HOVERED JUST IN FRONT OF ME  ABOUT 50 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. IT WAS DEFINITELY A SAUCER SHAPE AND IT  WAS SILENT, IT WAS GOLD AND THE CENTER OF IT  LOOKED LIKE REVOLVING MIRRORED PANELS THAT NOW I WOULD SAY WERE SOLAR COLLECTORS BUT BACK THEN I HAD NO IDEAL WHAT SOLAR POWER WAS. IT WAS IN THE AFTERNOON ON A CLEAR DAY WITH THE SUN SHINING ON THE CRAFT FROM BEHIND ME SO I DEFINITELY SEEN IT IN THE BEST LIGHT POSSIBLE. IT JUST HOVERED THERE FOR A SHORT TIME ANDTHEN JUST FLEW UP AND AWAY FROM ME TO THE RIGHT  VERY FAST AND OUT OF SITE. AT THE TIME I WAS HEADED FOR A WOODED AREA WITH A BB GUN IN MY HANDS. I DO NOT KNOW IF THE GUN HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH ITS INTEREST IN ME BUT I THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN  THE REASON. IF I HAD NOT SEEN THIS I THINK THAT I WOULD NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THE UFO STORIES THAT WE HEAR OF. I FIND IT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ANY BEINGS FROM OUTER SPACE COULD TRAVEL SUCH A VAST DISTANCE BUT MAYBE IT'S JUST BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION. SOMETIMES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SECRET MILITARY AIR CRAFT OR TEST CRAFT BUT I SAW IT OVER 25 YEARS AGO AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING AT ALL LIKE IT SINCE. BELIEVE ME OR NOT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND ABOUT WHAT ISAW. I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHERE IT CAME FROM BUT I CAN TELL YOU WITH CONVICTION THAT FLYING SAUCERS DO EXIST. PLEASE POST THIS AND MY EMAIL ADDRESS. IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME ABOUT THIS SIGHTING  I WILL TRY TO ANSWER THEM. IF YOU THINK THAT YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THIS VERY SAME TYPE OF CRAFT PLEASE EMAIL YOUR STORY TO ME. derenberg@hotmail.com;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
A disc shaped craft, approximately thirty feet in diameter, hovered silently roof level.;1981-10-04 19:00:00;Minutes;A disc shaped craft, approximately thirty feet in diameter, hovered silently roof level. My two sons and I stood in awe on our front porch as a disc shaped craft, approximately thirty feet in diameter, hovered silently roof level at the intersection of two cross streets --- just feet from where we stood.  The laser-like lights on the craft struck the street below.   As I began to think this is not possible, the craft slowly gyrated in place as if to show all aspects of itself.  As I looked up and down the street I thought the lack of cars on the road was equally bizarre.  The craft then slowly and silently floated down the street parallel to the street.   The craft stopped momentarily at the end of the street and then instantaneously propelled into the southeastern sky at speeds that defy modern physics. www.seekingmoinfo.com;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Drove right underneath a UFO while on the freeway--saw 3 more UFOs;1992-11-27 19:50:00;two minutes;Drove right underneath a UFO while on the freeway--saw 3 more UFOs This happened in 1992 in late Nov/early Dec at around 7:50pm. I was driving south on 270 to a friend’s house and was passing by Port Columbus Airport, when I saw on my right what at first I thought was a helicopter (being so near the airport it seemed logical). It was around the size of a helicopter but had no tail or rotors, etc. I kept looking at it because it didn’t move and was a shadowy disk shape with white lights around the edge. I then thought it was only a plane coming in to land, but it just sat in the sky. I kept driving.  Then I noticed an identical UFO about 50 feet directly above a box car of a train on the Columbus & Ohio River Railroad bridge that goes right past the airport. The UFO was shining a large white light down from the center of the underside of the disk onto one of the box cars, as though it were inspecting it. The light was very wide, taking up the middle part of the underside of the UFO—maybe it was at least a 7-10ft. wide searchlight. It was illuminating an entire box car and part of another.  I then noticed a third identical-looking UFO to my left in a grassy area right before the bridge. It was almost touching the ground, and it shown a bright white searchlight on the ground, too. (My truck was noisy, but I could not hear any noise from the UFOs). I passed under the railroad bridge, directly under the one UFO above it. I became excited and exited at Broad St. instead of Main St., which is where I was originally headed. As I was about to make a U-turn to get back onto 270, I saw yet a fourth identical UFO directly in front of me, but higher in the sky and further away, possibly 500 feet away.  I made the U-turn and got back onto 270 and continued to Main St. I didn't try and go back the other way on 270 to take another look, because I would be late to an appointment. There were many cars on the freeway, so there had to be others who saw the UFOs. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I say hovering cause it moved like that, no;1998-12-02 17:00:00;5 minutes;It was a round/disk shaped object that reflected the sunlight. It was hovering at an angle. I say hovering cause it moved like that, not like it was something flying in a straight line like an airplane. It hovered for a few seconds and then disappeared. It reappeared 3 more times in completely different spots in the sky, but in the same area. I was driving at the time watching this happen. I was driving out to my brother's Hockey Game to give him an envelope he forgot at home. I was getting off of the 270east freeway exit ramp at Easton and was watching an airplane (commercial, passenger jet) The sun was setting so I watched the sunset and there were white jet trails in the sky. There is an airport East of there so the Commercial Jet, was just at an upwards climb, and low in the sky. Out by the closest white jet stream, actually below it to the right, was a round/saucer shaped object that was hovering in the sky at an angle. It reflected the sunlight underneath it and was dark on top. It hovered for a few seconds, but long enough that I got a good look at it. I kept looking and it reappeared in a different spot to the right and above where it was before in the sky. It acted the same way and disappeared again. It was definitely the same object. It reappeared a third time below the second spot and to the right sort of making a triangle of appearances. It acted the same way again and disappeared, and I had to turn the corner. It didnt act the exact same way each time, but hovered and was at a slant. I parked at the Easton Ice Rink where my brother plays hockey and went inside to give him his envelope. I went back outside and watched the sky for a few minutes. I didnt see the object again. I drove down the bottom of the hill and across to a newly built parking lot  and turned around and watched the sky for a moment. The two jet trails were still visible, well obviously because there were jets attached ot the trails. I was about to drive away, and saw the object again. There was a black helicopter flying above a neighborhood near there, and the object was farther out in the sky about the same distance it was before, and acted in the same manner and finally disappeared. It was probably not as far away as the jet trails in the sky, but it was close enough I could see it clearly. I had to get back to my store, so I after it disappeared the fourth time, I didnt see it for a few minutes, I left and drove back. This might have been one of the same objects or four different ones, but they were all the same, all four times. My opinion is it was one object. I happened to not see it outside of the car, only when I was inside the car. But, it was definitely, something in the sky and not something like a reflection in my windshield. The car was not moving when I saw it the fourth time. I am 21 years old, and I run my own business in Westerville, Ohio. Which is where I drove from this day. I have seen many documented videos on recent UFO and/or flying saucer footage, and I didnt think I would ever see something to look and act quite that close to what I have witnessed on those documents. I would have never even noticed it if I hadnt been watching the airplanes, and the sunset like I was.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Glowing UFO seen in Columbus that began traveling backwards nearly instantly;2004-09-21 19:30:00;5 minutes;Glowing UFO seen in Columbus that began traveling backwards nearly instantly I cannot confirm exactly what it is that I saw. It was flat however, with no limbs of any sort such as wings found on an airplane. I could slightly tell the shape was reminiscent of a disk or saucer.  It began its journey in the near proximity of the moon. As it neared larger cloud formations I could at times see that it was going behind them. The only clouds present in the sky were the high cirrus clouds, yet like I said earlier, I could roughly discern a shape.  As it came from behind a cloud, it had lost its glow and now its shape was much more clearly prominent. It was then a dull metallic hue. Moments later it vanished from sight.  Its descent across 1/4 of the sky had taken no more than two minutes. Keep in mind that this was not traveling away from me. It kept its size and girth throughout and seemed to be traveling in an arc or semicircle around my location.  I frantically searched the dusk sky for the object but I could no longer see it. Resigned to thinking I had hallucinated, I walked away defeated all the while fighting the urge to run into a nearby restaurant and shout Did you see the UFO?!  A quick glance caught me off guard as I realized that the object was back in the sky and glowing- only now it was suddenly traveling the opposite direction.  Correct me if I speak wrongly, but can a plane suddenly begin traveling the exact opposite direction in mid flight?  Either I'm on a rollercoaster and this is loony land or I really did see a UFO tonight.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Unidentified solo object over Columbus;2005-07-21 23:00:00;approx. 20 seconds;Unidentified solo object over Columbus My son and I had just pulled in my driveway after working late on a network wiring job.  It was a full moon and there was a large cloud formation just blocking the moon, but the upper side of the cloud formation was illuminated by the moon.  It was a great image and we got out and my son started photographing the cloud formation with his camera phone.  The cloud formation resembled a developing thunderhead.  I'm a fairly avid sky watcher and I noticed an object moving from left to right across our line of sight as my son was photographing the cloud formation.  The object was illuminated an unusual amber across it's length and there were no blinking lights as a plane or helicopter would have, and the longer I watched it the more obvious it became that it was, in fact, unidentifiable.  There were no wings on the object.  It was travelling a path not normally taken by local air traffic at the altitude it was at.  I wish I could give an altitude, but I'm not well versed in that.  It was at an altitude I normally see the business class of Lear jets travelling at as they leave the airport on the east side of Columbus.  However, this object was flying a straight horizontal path with no deviation in altitude during the time I observed it.  There was commercial aircraft visible in the region higher up, but nothing close to this object.  I commented, That's not a plane.  My son replied, What is that? He then took a picture of it and commented how weird it was.  Some of what appears as a faint outline of a series of trees in the background at left is, in fact, the clouds we were looking at.  The object was in the foreground of the cloud formation we were initially looking at.  The object is just about to move out of our view to the right.  The light in the foreground is over my garage.  There is a Magnolia tree visible and the living space is to the right of the garage.  My son's laptop had to go in for service, and it took awhile to get this photo back from him.  I document our hours so I'm positive of the date.  The time is accurate to +/- 15 minutes.  Strange, the object appears sightly different than what I visually observed, and looks closer than I recall.  It was better lit visually I also recall.  It's entire side circumference was a dull amber glow, with a distinct dark border on top and bottom when I first observed it.  The trajectory was roughly east to west.  There was no sound evident.  I'll foward the image exactly as I have received it from my son.  Nothing has been done to alter the image.  The camera takes very good images, but a little blurring is evident in the foreground, which may have also affected the clarity of the object. itself.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

low flying Silver disk ufo sighted in central ohio. Seen in broad daylight then became invisible;2011-11-07 08:58:00;15 seconds;low flying Silver disk ufo sighted in central ohio. Seen in broad daylight then became invisible The sighting happened on route 33 just outside of lancaster ohio. a silver disk hovered about 100ft off the ground right off the highway just before 9 am. i rolled down my window to get a better look at and i saw that it had a bright white illuminated rim and appeared to have a smooth silver bottom with deep segmented indents which makes it difficult to determine if the entire craft was spinning or if the bottom was spinning or changing shape independently. it had a gold or orange tint to the top part and I have to say the bottom metal part was far more shiny than any other metal i have ever seen.I am unsure if the craft was moving or stationary because my car was in motion but it seemed to move 20ft in my direction then it dissapeared. there was no audible noise accompanied with it. when it dissapeared it became transparent. it did not seem to go anywhere ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Floating disk with red, yellow, green, and white lights appeared and then vanished with a small white flash but NO noise.;2014-06-27 23:00:00;10 seconds;Floating disk with red, yellow, green, and white lights appeared and then vanished with a small white flash but NO noise. I was sitting on my porch in my backyard hanging out with friends when I looked up at the sky and I saw a round dick looking object floating in the sky.   Some neighbors were setting off fire crackers a few yards down so I originally thought what I was seeing was a fire cracker, however that wasn't the case.   This object was floating in one place in the sky and was making no noise whatsoever.  It had alternating green, yellow, white, and red lights circling around the exterior of the object, this was how I observed the shape - round disk/saucer.   It stayed there for maybe a total of 10 seconds and then it just disappeared with a small white flash, but no noise coinciding with its departure.   My neighbors continued to set off fire crackers for the rest of the night but I never saw anything again like what I had seen for that brief 10 seconds.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
