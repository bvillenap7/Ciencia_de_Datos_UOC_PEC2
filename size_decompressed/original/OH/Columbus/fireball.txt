At the time I was an Airman in the Air Force, was stationed at Rickenbacker Air National Guard Base outside of Columbus, Ohio. I was a Security Specialist standing guard at the Alert Aircraft Re-fueling Area (referred to as Post 6). I was walking behind the blast shields waiting for a flight exercise which is pulled off at least once per shift by the Flight Sgt. or an appointed member of our flight. These are expected as a regular training exercise to keep us on our toes. When  I noticed several fireballs going across the sky from North to South. They came across at farely regular intervals and appeared to be ashing off as they passed, but never faded out they just flew out of sight. I called it out over the radio to the desk, they said they would check it out, and then said they had just heard other reports of the same kind on police scanners and from other posts, but would get back to me. Later that shift the Armed Response Team came out to my post with the Flight Sgt. They told me that a notation would be made in the Blotter but as the official word would report, that I did not see anything... Well I let it go at that because I was a good soldier that didn't know how I might be treated if I carried it out any futher. It has always bugged me that I never said anything to anyone else other than a very few close friends. I don't remember anything else about that night until about a half hour or so before I was relieved of my post at shift change. Since that time though I have had terrible luck maintaing employment and a home to call home. I feel as though I must move every 6 monthes or so. I have moved probaly 30 times since then and had as many or more jobs as well. This isn't something I am proud of or tell many about as it seems very EXTREME. I don't know that it will help to put this statement Out There , but, I am hoping it will not Harm me. If there is anyone else who might remember anything similar to this at around that time frame or have exrerienced similar problems of mine please list it here in this forum. I am serious, so PLEASE don't patronize me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
3 objects within 30 minutes;1999-03-12 05:10:00;30 minutes;3 objects within 30 minutes I was driving northbound on U.S. 33 when I saw a green streak of light going from the south to the north. I stopped to get some gasoline, and when I proceeded in the same direction about 15 minutes later, I saw two more green streaks of light, one right behind the other, in about the same position in the sky, going in the same direction. I stopped at a traffic light when a car pulled up next to me. He got my attention, signaled me to roll down my window, and asked Did you just see 2 green streaks in the sky...or am I losing it? I told him I saw the same thing, he said OK, and then turned. It was a clear sky, and these objects were very high in the sky, very far north of Columbus...I'd say at least over Lake Erie/Sandusky Ohio area...but it's too hard to determine where they entered the atmosphere exactly.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

My wife and son and I were traveling west on Powell Rd. in north Columbus when I noticed the object at about 40 degrees elevation in the northwest sky falling south at a very rapid rate (faster than other shooting stars i've seen) to about 30 degrees elevation in the southern sky.  The size of the object was x3 the size of Jupiter and was twinkling the color of the green light in a stoplight. It was probably just a meteor but it was a very cool meteor. see above.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Orange orb / ball seen over NE columbus ohio;2011-08-02 23:00:00;10-20sec;Orange orb/ball seen over NE columbus ohio   I was coming home from work and left the store around 10:30PM EST.  I have a 20 min commute I from the center of town to the north end of the outer-belt (I-270) where I stay at.  The night was fairly clear, but I can't see too many stars due to light pollution.  I am in the city (obviously) but my street has no lighting what so ever.  Its kinda isolated which is why we chose to live here.  I was coming East down my street (approx. a 1/4 mi of no lights / straight shot to a T intersection) and saw an orange glow in the sky.  I would guess that from the horizon it was up approx. 30-40 degrees in the air, and was an orange ball.  I think it was between 2-7 mi away in distance from me.    I saw it traveling from at least north to south, if not NW to SE (which is my better guess but not 100% sure).  I THOUGHT I might have see 1 flashing light happen as if it were an airplane, but this thing was going at a pretty decent pace.   The only thing I can think of that would go at its speed from that low would be a helicopter, but there was no sound, and I don't get much air traffic over my house from Port Columbus Int'l.  Too fast for a smaller aircraft, and definitely not an airliner.  I saw it travel, then I drove up by a tree and lost sight of it because of the tree, and then it was gone.  I looked outside for 10 min not find it.   The orange color was about the same tint as the orange in highway lights that make everything gray. I don't think it was jupiter (or any other planet) due to the movement and that I lost sight of it.  But I'm not ruling out the thought.  Maybe someone knows where certain planets are at this time of year and specifically for that date.   I don't know of any aircraft that have that orange tint to their headlights.  I've seen the normal white, and recently saw an airplane w/ LED (like the obnoxious head lights that pure white).

Orange Glowing Orb or Fireball seen over Columbus OH, (North OSU Campus);2012-08-29 00:31:00;1 minute;Orange Glowing Orb or Fireball seen over Columbus OH, (North OSU Campus) Observation: Myself and a close friend were walking South in an alley between 18th and 17th Street, OSU Campus.  We saw two objects in the sky to the South-East of our location.  The objects appeared to be orange lights.  They were travelling away from us (S.E.) at approx. 1000 feet above ground, and approx. 100-150 mph.  The 2 objects travelled in the same direction, in a straight line formation.  The second trailed the other by 100-200 feet.  At this point they were quite far off, such that we did not get a detailed look at them.  The objects left our field of vision in the distance to the South-East of us.  Then about 10-15 seconds later we observed what appeared to be the same orange objects, however this time the objects were to the North-East of us, travelling South-East.  They were much closer this time, passing our longitude at a few hundred feet to the North of our location.  At this point we observed the objects in greater detail.  Both objects were travelling in the same trajectory as previously observed, with the same approx. altitude and velocity, travelling the same approx. distance apart.  Their speed, altitude, and trajectory remained constant.  The orange objects, now at a much closer distance to our position, appeared to be comprised of two sections, upper and lower.  The upper section of the object appeared to be spherical in shape, with a light emitting a ‘glowing’ effect, rather than a ‘shining’ effect.  The lower section was a shining orange light, and appeared to be swaying back and forth in relation to the upper part.  These observed qualities led us to thi! nk that these were balloons, with a glowing globe, and an under-basket emitting a orange flame which illuminated the upper globe portion. 	 However a few questions remain unanswered.  One, the objects appeared to be about the size of a small 4-person propeller plane.  The orange globe appeared to be too similar in size to the orange light underneath for it to be the parachute of a balloon.  Two, the objects travelled at a velocity much faster than a typical balloon.  Three, how did the two objects move so quickly from the SE of us to the NE of us in a matter of seconds, or were there in fact 4 glowing objects in the sky?  About the Observers: I am a 22 year old Music Instructor, recently graduated from Under-grad. My friend is 23 years old, on break from school, working as a restaurant server.  We are house-mates and close friends. We both observed the same objects, agreeing on the physical characteristics, and details of the event, to the best of our knowledge.  Neither of us were able to identify these objects, although our closest guess was some sort of balloon.  We were intrigued by them and looked online with the intent to find some explanation of what they were.  In our search we stumbled upon this reporting site and decided to write a report.  We found that our observations match those of many of the other entries depicting a &quotred/orange fireball or Orb&quot.  The above three paragraphs contain my personal account of the events which took place, recorded to the best of my knowledge.  My friend recorded a short video-clip of the objects using his iPhone.  But he went to bed, so I am unable to upload that at this time.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Strange glowing fireball/orange object moving quickly in Columbus, OH.;2013-09-01 21:15:00;3 minutes;Strange glowing fireball/orange object moving quickly in Columbus, OH Looking east the night of September 1 there was a very strange orange ball shaped object heading due north that we could see from my uncle's patio.  It looked like something on fire very high up in the air.  It looked to be about the height of a helicopter but there was no sound.  There a a lot of trees in the neighborhood and it went behind some heading east and gaining altitude. We went to the front yard where the object seemed to be much higher at this point and had turned heading northeast.  My uncle said it seemed to be changing course as it went.  There was not a trail behind it like you would expect if it was on fire and moving as quickly as it was.  The intensity of the orange/fire would change as well and when it started heading northeast it looked more like a light than a fire.  Columbus is very close to a major airport and we get planes all the time, there were planes much higher so we could compare the lights and sound and there was no sound coming off this object.  And no blinking lights as with aircraft.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

While travelling through Columbus, Ohio, saw a bright object break into 3 pieces go dark and reappear as 6.;2014-07-03 21:15:00;6 minutes;While travelling through Columbus, Ohio, saw a bright object break into 3 pieces go dark and reappear as 6. I was driving my family from Seymour Indiana to New Hampshire on vacation which requured is to go through columbus Ohio.  I was driving north on I 71 north just south of the city looking for my next turn to continue on 71n when I noticed a bright object to my left, NW about 11 in the sky at a high but undetermined altitude.  I thought it was a meteor or comet because of the intensity of the light and it appeared to have a tail behind the head.  I yelled to my family to see it and they did. I yelled for them to video it which two of them did.  Instead of one object it suddenly broke into three pieces and continued falling and then they disappeared for a brief moment and the sky went dark and then suddenly 6 light appeared with odd shapes like a triangle and I thought it might be a parachute drill team, but they started moving around in an irregular pattern which made me think debris again until they came together in a line and came down together until they all went dark at the same time and did not twinkle or go out like a flare, or one at a time.   They all suddenly vanished at the same time.   We have video and cannot find out anything on this via news or reports which makes me wonder what we witnessed.  I would like help in knowing and where to have the video reviewed;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

They fell in a zig zag pattern one behind the other equidistant from each other rather slow going north then west like a z.   They were bright orange.   Too low and slow to be jets or planes.

I looked up at it to try and see what it was and it was so bright it honestly felt like I was trying to look into the sun.  It was something I have never seen before and I am outside every night.   I grabbed a pair of sun glasses out of my car as the same time as my phone rang.  When I put the glasses on and tried to look up at it again it was gone.  IT vanished straight up in the sky and seemed like it moved instantly.   I Answered my Phone and it was a friend of mine who lives two streets over.

Both men assumed it was a normal aircraft light coming towards us, light first, in the night sky.  When we realized it was flying upwards and towards the East, it flew behind a tree.  We ran across my yard to get better perspective.  When we found the object in the sky again, it had risen and appeared as a if it were riding along the Earth's outer atmosphere.  My perspective made it appear like a distorted circle of light with a dark dot in the center, that I assume was an aircraft or missile.
