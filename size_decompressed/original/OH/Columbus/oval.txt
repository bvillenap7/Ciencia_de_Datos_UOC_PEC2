5-7 objects flying in formation;2004-01-24 22:30:00;15-20 sec;5-7 objects flying in formation On Saturday evening I walked out to my truck, as I was about to open the door I looked up into the sky and saw what I thought at first were Canadian geese. As I continued to watch these objects, I realized these were not geese. There were approximately 5-7 oval shaped, light brown in color, objects flying in a southerly direction over apartment buildings. They were approximately 2-300 feet above the ground flying in some sort of formation, like 3 in the front and 3 or 4 behind, they were moving too fast to be a bird, but there was no sound of any type of engine, as I continued to watch, the pattern of flight was somewhat erratic, not like that of a plane,there wereno lights on any of these objects, I put on my glasses to see if I could get a better view, and I could not see anything. I took my glasses off and I saw only 2 of the objects right above me, then all of a sudden, the objects, ascended very rapidly into the high thin clouds in a type of crescent pattern and then disappeared. I could not believe what I had just witnessed and had a nauseaus feeling at that point. I contacted a local news station to see if there had been any other reports or sightings- NONE;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
Luminous blue Cloud-Orb spotted over the Sky area of Buffalo NY from Columbus, OH same time as crash of Aircraft;2009-02-12 22:08:00;about 20 Minutes;Luminous blue Cloud-Orb spotted over the Sky area of Buffalo NY from Columbus, OH same time as crash of Aircraft Friday Feb. 13th, 2009  Reporting a UFO  I went out onto the North facing back porch last night…it was 10:08 PM, therebouts..looked at a cloudless sky, seen a ‘luminous Blue Cloud’ in a direction of 110 degrees N-North East from my position.  It appeared as a fuzzy blue luminous Orb, oval shaped for the most part…it was at approximately 30 to 40 degrees arc from the horizon. I just kept watching it…it was slowly moving, but then stationary…I called for my Wife whom also came out and I said, what is that?  She looked for a moment and said, “looks like a cloud, why is it blue?”  I said, “why is it stationary and there were no other visible clouds in that region of Sky?”  She returned back in the house…seconds later, it began moving. I kept watching it and it had like a burst of luminosity…lasting about 3 seconds or so…then slowly moved southeasterly…towards the Pittsburg PA region…stationary for five seconds, quit moving…then, vanished. I now know the time I seen this luminous blue Orb cloud, at exactly at the time the Aircraft crashed in Buffalo NY. 110 degree s heading from my position IS directly lined up with Buffalo NY. What I believe is that I seen a Weaponized Cloud that released an Energy Drain Beam at the area and that Aircraft that cashed and killed all on board, including Beverly Eckert of the 911 Truth investigations. Also had a friend in that area, but in Ohio, located at 110 degrees from my position that commented she was very tired last night, all of a sudden…went to bed early!  She did not see anything as she did not go outside. Now, I have conducted many, many Weapons systems hidden by the gov.  ChemTrails being at the top of that research and investigation…I know they have such Cloud Weapons platforms and I know I seen one in action last evening, resulting in the Murder of these innocent people.

((HOAX??))  A big colorful oval shaped vessel slowly descending, while spinning and moving forward. No noise what so ever.;2013-09-24 22:33:00;15 minutes;A big colorful oval shaped vessel slowly descending, while spinning and moving forward. No noise what so ever.  i could have touched it I was working tonight at chase at easton office center, when I decided to go for a walk. I went through the back door and walked behind the building.  I was playing with my phone when i saw some thing colorful in the SKY.  I ran to get a closer look, and went to the side of the building.  There's a sidewalk there and i was on it. It was about 10:33pm. Mifflin High School is Behind Chase.   I saw this big ballon like thing. It was colorful, bright spinning and going down at the same time.   I though my eyes were playing tricks on me  but NO!! It was slowly descending.  This white guy saw it too, he just gave me a blank stare.  It landed near Mifflin High school in the field, and I then lost sight of it.  I went back inside. I put all the chase cameras on that spot to see..if it rises again.  But after my shift ended 15 minutes later at 11pm, I drove to Mifflin high school and tried finding the same spot i saw it land.  I hopped the fence and went to the baseball field, nothing was there but the ground was hot and it was like 60 DEGREES outside.  I HAVE NO ((deleted)) IDEA WHAT I SAW..BUT IT WASNT A PLANE OR A HELICOPTER.  I DONT THINK THEY CAN SPIN , GO DOWN AND MOVE FORWARD AT THE SAME TIME.  IT WAS ALSO HUGE.  I should have recorded it on my phone..or jumped the fence at that 2nd and just went to it!!  But i was too scared.  I'm going go to the same spot tomorrow night, with my camera.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Slowly separated and dimmed and brightened.  Some at very high altitude.  Lights disappeared as we got closer.   As we followed the last light it faded out and wevcould see the oval silhouette as it moved away slowly and then took off at a high rate of speed.   One of the other lights went straight up when we drove under  and then took off very quickly in the other direction.   Asked locals at a nearby store on the west side about the lights. They told us friends frontage east side had also seen lights earlier in the night.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833

Upon inspection, did not appear to be a drone or blimp.   I honestly have never seen anything like it before and was shocked, as it was a busy evening and there were many people out and about.   We watched and observed for as long as we could, whilst driving, and when our view was blocked by trees for a few minutes, we could not longer see the UFO.;39.9929475579356;-82.9803267468833
