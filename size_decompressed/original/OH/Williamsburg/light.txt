It's;2013-07-28 02:00:00;10 seconds;My friend and I were having a bonfire just hanging out (no alcohol was present) and we were just about to clean up and go inside. It's about 2 in the morning and we look up and I though I saw a plane which is common for this area but the closer I watched it no lights were blinking like the usual planes do.  It was almost like an orange glow.  The object seemed pretty high in elevation and if that's the case then it was moving very fast and also it was silent. I would hear a plane at normal elevations and it didn't make a sound which leads me to believe it was very high up. I began the shine my flashlight at the object and repeatedly turned it on and off with it pointed at the object.  Then after about ten seconds the object just disappeared.  I couldn't say if it sped up really fast and that made it disappear or whether the light turned off but either way it disappeared. The whole thing just seemed very unnatural and freaked me out a bit.  I'm not sure exactly what I saw but I thought I should report it to you guys to at least get it out.;39.0778;-84.0392000000001
