At first it seemed to move at an airplanes pace for about 6-7 seconds.  But it seemed to be to large and to bright for an airplane.   After about 7 seconds it seemed to morph into a green light that was super intense. The green light lasted only a second. At that time its airplane like pace changed to a warp speed.  Much faster than anything I can imagine anything on this earth capable of doing. I would guess in much greater excess of 1000 mph.  And yet no sound was ever heard. An aircraft would at least break the sound barrier.  It even left a green streak behind it for a split millisecond as if the light itself could not even keep up with the actual object.(possible light distortion.  Left me in disbelief for the rest of the day.;39.0778;-84.0392000000001
