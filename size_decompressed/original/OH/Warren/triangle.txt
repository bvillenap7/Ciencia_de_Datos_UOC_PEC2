Triangle craft with a bright blue and white light in 2 corners, and a red blinking light in the other.;2005-09-01 22:00:00;5 min;Triangle craft with a bright blue and white light in 2 corners, and a red blinking light in the other. I was walking out of my former high schools band night when i saw three different colored lights in the distance.  I was with my gf and i always joke about ufo's, and since this looked different i joked..... That was until we drove and it went over us.  I looked up and saw a White, Blue, and a red blinkink light, one light at each corner.  it was in the city, and i could make out a triangle shaped air craft.  I told my gf to pull over but she wouldnt, and she thinks i am still joking, and i am seriously not joking!
