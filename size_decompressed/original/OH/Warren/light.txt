Hovering lights in sky followed by jets around the area;2003-12-21 19:52:00;ongoing;Hovering lights in sky followed by jets around the area We were looking at stars when all of a sudden what we thought was a star proceeded to move up...not left or right, up!  THen 2 other stars did move right then proceeded to hover in one spot.  While watching these we say 3 planes circiling the area where these mysterious lights were at.  Strange, now I think I'm a believer for sure.;41.2376462129527;-80.7740383095507

Bright red orb found amongst 9 U.S. jets in Warren, Ohio!!!!!!!;2004-11-13 17:25:00;10 seconds;Bright red orb found amongst 9 U.S. jets in Warren, Ohio!!!!!!! As we were driving i looked out my window to see that there was an unusually large number of jets flying through the air. At least nine (9) that my dad and I counted.  I was watching just joking with him, hey i bet theres a ufo or something.  But it was not funny, out of the sunset sky glowed an intense bright red orb. However, it slowly faded away to the point where it was no longer visible and then it slowly returned to its intense light.  It then slowly faded away again and never came back. When the light faded, there was no object visible like any craft of any saort, it just was like an orb slowly fading away and back.  The distance it was from me i could not determine.;41.2376462129527;-80.7740383095507
Light Flashes in the sky;2007-08-04 01:30:00;2 hours+;Light Flashes in the sky I seen flashes of light in the sky in 1 spot. They were bright enough to light up the clouds in that given spot and would occur every 5-15 seconds for 1 hour. I called a nearby relative who went outside and seen the flashes were actually in 3 spots. The flashes repeatedly appeared in these 3 spots with no solid pattern detected. 2 hours later, I looked outside and the spot I noticed before had moved a lot closer but no longer flashing every 5-15 seconds and now more like every minute or so now. A one point I heard what sounded like a helicopter outside. This could very well be some very active heat lightning, though never seen a bolt. I also never heard of it being so active in the same few spots. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));41.2376462129527;-80.7740383095507
Strange lights in NE Ohio.;2019-07-04 03:45:00;04:45;Strange lights in NE Ohio Bright light traveling from south to north at  a modest/high rate of speed.  The light was similar to the color of Venus.  The light stopped at what looked to be north of Cortland, Ohio, very high in the sky.  The light hovered and flashed a very bright red and and whiteish color.  At times it looked to dart up and down and left to right 40 to 60Â° N.E.  and even in a circulator motion.  We viewed this from our our back yard then from bedroom window until sunrise. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
