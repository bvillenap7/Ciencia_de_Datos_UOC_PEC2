We were teenagers about 15 or 16 years old still in high school. My best friend was over my home to play baskeball across the street while we were playing I LOOKED up near my home and what I saw was unbelivable above my house was  2 big big disk round ships they were just floating side by side, I looked at my friend and said  look look what is that and he just said ohhh just another ufo thing that we been hearing about. Soo being just kids we didn't  care and just picked up where we were playing basketball.  Now being 45 years old I been thinking about it alot, what happened in 1975 soo that is the truth and I will never forget that in my mind what I saw and felt. Thanks for listening  because I only told one another person about it and he did'nt care. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Fiery orange, hovering object.;2014-07-12 20:50:00;7 minutes;Fiery Orange Hovering Object. My husband and I were sitting in our back yard, just before dusk.  Some bright fiery light caught my eye in the sky to the east.  I watched this object move very slowly move from east to west.  It was hovering just below the clouds.  It was a very odd cylinder shape and extremely bright orange lights or fiery flames.   As the flames died down, the object moved to a northern direction.  It hovered high in the sky for approximately 3 or 4 minutes and then it slowly moved straight up, vertically, out of our view with no lights.  The whole event was truly shocking, and lasted about 7-10 minutes.  The object would have been approximately over Route 11 north.;41.2376462129527;-80.7740383095507
