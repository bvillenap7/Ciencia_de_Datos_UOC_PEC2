Gigantic wing, with 12 blue orbs across the rear, flys across the sky over highway.;1997-12-31 20:30:00;15 seconds;Gigantic wing, with 12 blue orbs across the rear, flys across the sky over highway. I was born in Canton, OH.  Shortly after my family moved to Poland, OH.  We lived there until my father got a promotion in 1985.  We then moved to Warren, OH, where I lived until the beginning of 2000.  I was an above average student in High School (class of 1995), but never aspired to go to college.  I started work at a local pizza shop in the beginning of 1996. On December 31 1997,  I got off of work shortly after 8 pm.  I already had several guests waiting at my apartment on the other side of town to celebrate the New Year.  It was an over-cast night with no precipitation at that time.   I always took the outer-belt Route 82 East to get home, that night was no different.  I was just past the Elm Rd exit on the part of the highway that goes north-south when I looked up and saw it. It was approximately 8:30 pm.  I saw what at first I thought was a row of floodlights slowly heading west across the sky in front of me. I looked closer because the lights were a different color and quantity than the floodlights I usually saw in the sky on cloudy nights.  What I was looking at was a giant boomerang shaped aircraft with a dozen large blue lights across the rear.  More interesting was the fact that it was just above the bottom of the cloud ceiling, and I could see the clouds rolling under it and around the front out-lining the shape of this UFO. The blue lights were round in shape and a hazed blue color.  The lights alone were the size of the Hercules C-130 airplanes that fly out of the Vienna Air Force base on daily flight patterns over the area (at least at that time).  One of my best friends at the time, his father was a mechanic in the Air Force at that base.  I went to many air shows with them and saw the largest military plane at that time and it was nowhere near as large as what I saw that night.  It covered the sky from the top of my windshield to just above the horizon.  It had to be at least 2000 feet across but probably larger. The experience lasted about 15 seconds, so it had to be moving slower than current physics would allow to keep something that massive aloft. The highway is hemmed on both sides by tall trees and hills making it difficult to see the sky beyond.;41.2376462129527;-80.7740383095507
7 bright objects flying by;2012-07-04 23:00:00;15 minutes;7 bright objects flying by I was sitting on my front porch, watching fireworks, when I noticed 2 bright red objects flying by, then 3 more, then 2 more. They were moving in a stright line, going west to east.  We do have an air force base in the direction they were moving.  I did not hear any sounds with them. They were not fireworks, that much I am sure of,  they were moving like plains across the sky.  Each one of them was bright red which made me stop and wonder what I was seeing, with no sound of an aircraft. They didn't flash , just bright red objects flying by.;41.2376462129527;-80.7740383095507
