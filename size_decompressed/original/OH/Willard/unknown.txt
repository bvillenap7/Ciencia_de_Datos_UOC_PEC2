I wasn't sure what I saw.  I was coming home from work one night and I live in Sandusky but I was working in Willard Ohio.  I saw lights in a field but it just didn't look right.   I slowed down and looked out at the field.  The lights were vertical in the field and there were numerous lights.  I wasn't sure if it were a machine to till the ground or not.  The problem was I did not see or hear machinery at all.   I stopped on the side of the road for a minute but there was still no sound.  I believe it to have been a UFO. If you saw anything like this during that time in Ohio then I know that is what it was.  I have been thinking about this ever since I saw it.
