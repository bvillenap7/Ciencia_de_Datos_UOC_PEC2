Three redish/orange fireball seen, then disappeared.;2013-07-05 23:00:00;3 minutes;Three redish/orange fireball seen, then disappeared. Me and my family were sitting in our house when we witnessed the first UFO. We saw some type of redish/orange sphere floating across the sky.  We did not think anything of it at that time.  Then we went out side about a half hour later, we were sitting outside and we saw another one, exact shape and color floating in the same direction.   It disappeared behind a tree and we walked where we could see behind the tree and it was gone! So we we decided it was a little weird.  We went inside about a half hour later and saw another exactly the same so we ran back outside and watched it.  It moved very quickly, soon enough it disappeared right in front of our eyes.  None of the three were flashing or anything, it was just a very steady light that moved along and disappeared.;41.0658999999998;-82.7295999999997
