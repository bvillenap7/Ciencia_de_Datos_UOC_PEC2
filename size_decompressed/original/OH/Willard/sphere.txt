Four red-orange spherical objects crossed the sky one after another on July 3rd;2010-07-03 23:30:00;4 minutes;Four red-orange spherical objects crossed the sky one after another on July 3rd I witnessed a red-orange spherical object that did not appear to be an airplane or a meteorite.  It crossed the sky slowly, taking approximately one minute until it went out of site.  Shortly after it disappeared another one started from the same place the first one started. In total there were four objects over the course of approximately four minutes, all one after the other in the exact same path.  It crossed the sky in a similar speed or fashion to an airplane, however there were not any blinking lights or white lights.  Airplanes are a very common site where I live, and this was no airplane.  There were three other adult witnesses sitting with me on the deck.  It was very bizarre, as it looked like a giant roman candle shooting slowly across the sky, but it would have been impossible for it to have been a firework, due to the fact that it crossed several miles of sky with no sound.
