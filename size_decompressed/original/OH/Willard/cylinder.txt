I noticed we could see the moon early today. Then just to the left of the I see a shiny cylinder like thing. It didn't seem to be going very fast, but it was very shiny. No lights blinking like our normal air traffic. This isn't my first sighting. I and my two kids witnessed fire in the sky. I believe strongly they're here.;41.0658999999998;-82.7295999999997
