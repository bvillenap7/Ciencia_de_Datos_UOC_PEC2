It was flying rather low and was black in color.  I liken it to a stealth bomber plane.  I had my wife come outside to look so people wouldn't think I was just making up stories. The craft did not fly flat/horizontally like an airplane would, it was flying with the front of the plane angled upward about 45% with the back end tilting downward.  After it circled the area mentioned 3-4 times it flew directly over the trees in the woods and disappeared into the trees. Seconds later an area of approximately 300 square yards was illuminated in the woods for around 10 minutes!  Airplanes don't land that way and it was not a helicopter, I saw it pretty closely flying right over my house. For about 20 seconds after it landed in the trees you could hear mechanical sounding wooshes.  Then in the field, after it was landed for a few minutes, I heard a couple times a weird kind of whistling sound in short intervals and not in a pattern like birds.  This sound came from my neighbors field near his barns about 200 yards away from where I stood.  It sounded like ordered talking, not simply random sounds. The whistling sound did resemble the tone of a birds whistles, but it sounded very large & had a slight guttural sound to it. Just to note, we did see 3 separate helicopters in the area after it was flying around for about 10 minutes.  Two of the helicopters left the area. However, the remaining helicopter flew over the woods several times after the strange craft landed and was emitting light.  After a few fly overs the helicopter left.  It was too dark to see if those were military aircrafts or not.;41.0658999999998;-82.7295999999997
