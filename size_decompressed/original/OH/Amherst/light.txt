The object/craft was able to stop time.;1977-12-28 02:00:00;3 minutes;The object/craft was able to stop time. A bright, star-like light descended at a 60 degree angle & did a 270 degree course change. Before it made the change of direction, it stopped time for about 3 minutes.  My car didn't seem to be moving, but my thought process continued, during the sighting. I found myself consciously smiling to myself.   After 3 minutes, time & motion returned to normal.  2 minutes later, an F-4 pursuit plane flew by at treetop level.  The object was flying towards the FAA site in Oberlin, Ohio.  In less than 30 seconds both craft had traveled beyond visual sight.   I'm a former USAF NCO.   I was totally sober & cognizant.   I've had about 10 visual sightings since then.
