Cone Shaped Object Photographed In Ohio;2007-03-22 19:01:00;Unknown;Cone Shaped Object Photographed In Ohio I am an amateur photographer and enjoy taking photographs of my local area.  After downloading the last batch of photographs I noticed a small speck on the top left of one image.  I at first thought it was a speck on my monitor.  After enlarging the image to 100% I found that this was no speck.  A cone shaped object is very much apparent.  At the time I took the photograph I never noticed anything in the sky.  I also took several more photographs of this same scene, none of which show anything in the sky.  I have been serving my local community as a police officer since 1995 and prior to that I was a Law Enforcement Specialist with the U.S. Air Force for almost nine years.;38.5263000000001;-82.6679000000003
