On Nov. 17, 18 or 19?, 2014, I was walking the dog sometime between 8 & 10 pm.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from commercial pilot.  PD));2014-11-17 18:00:00;3 minutes;On Nov. 17, 18 or 19? 2014, I was walking the dog, sometime between 8 & 10 pm, at ((XXXX) N. 2nd St., Ironton, OH).  It was a crystal clear night!   When I looked up to view the stars.  I saw two bright reddish-orange ring-shaped objects at approximately a 45 degree angle in the Northern horizon.  They appeared to be perfectly stationary and about the size of a nickel, held at arms length. Both had a perfectly round, solid outside ring, with a series of small bright orange dots   (same color as the outer ring) as an inner ring and closely arranged to the inner circumference of the outside rings. I was awestruck!  I am a commercial pilot, former Ohio State Highway Patrolman and a three-term Sheriff of Lawrence County.  I know the objects were not conventional aircraft. After watching them for a little over a minute, I decided to run into the house to get my iPhone camera.  I returned in less than a minute to find they had disappeared completely. :- I am interested to know if there are any others who may have witnessed them or if someone who can explain them. Thanks,;38.5263000000001;-82.6679000000003
