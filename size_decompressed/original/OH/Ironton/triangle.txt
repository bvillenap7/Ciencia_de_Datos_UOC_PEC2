Black triangle with paulsing orb on underside.;2000-06-05 21:00:00;30min;Black triangle with paulsing orb on underside. We enjoy bondfires in the summer months as a time talk to our childeren and grand-childeren. Except for a smal bank of clouds to the south, the night was clear all stars were clearly seen. If not for the strobing light on the underside,we would not have seen it. It was a black triangle with a large strobing light on the bottom. It was moving at same speed as the cloud. It was moving from west to east at 10to20 miles an hour. We watched it for 20to30 min,s. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.5263000000001;-82.6679000000003
