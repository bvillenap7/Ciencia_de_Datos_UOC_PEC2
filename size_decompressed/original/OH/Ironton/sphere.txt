No sound trail or color change it was just moving on.;1993-02-15 20:15:00;2-3seconds;No sound trail or color change it was just moving on. My x wife and I were approx 1 mile from rt243 going to her fathers home when we both noticed this sphere about the size of the moon go from east to west at a very high rate of speed. Faster than an SR71 at full throttle.It was a harvest moon color sort of amber;38.5263000000001;-82.6679000000003
Spherical orbs that appear to be luminous.;1996-09-15 10:30:00;2 minutes;Spherical orbs that appear to be luminous. We were camping on the North side of Wayne National Forest in Southern, Ohio.  We took some service roads to a remote location North of the lake and  settled down for the evening.  We were looking at the stars towards the South.  We noticed some movement in the sky, just singular points of light that seemed to be moving in the triangular patterns.  We didn't think much of it at the time, but what we experienced next was incredible.  As we were observing the night sky over the treeline from the South, two glowing orbs moved towards us very close(within 15 feet).  As soon as we both saw them they stopped hovering in mid-air.  They were multi-colored and seemed to be luminous.  It was as if we, the orbs and us, were having a telepathic communication and that we were both aware of each others prescence.  The time that elapsed at this point was minimal as they both moved overhead and traveled North out of our sight.  There was no engine noise and they did not look like mechanical devices.  They did not have flashing lights or make any noise whatsoever.  It felt like they were observing us and we had luckily noticed them.  The only thing I have ever seen to compare them to is ball lightning,because they were spherical.  But the shy was completely clear and there were no thuderstorms in the area.;38.5263000000001;-82.6679000000003
