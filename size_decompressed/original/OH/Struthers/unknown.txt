It was just after three in the morning. (3:00 AM) I when out to take the trash out, it was Sunday night.  I looked up as I always do, just to look at the stares.  What pulled my eye was a vary light line or what at first I thought they were stares.  Maybe five or six or them. It was routing clock wise vary slowly.  Now the craft or what ever it was seemed to fade like it was falling out of focus.  Like I didn't want to see it, like my eyes didn't want to see it.  I went in side after that, I felt to uneasy like something would happen if I stayed out side.  Also, a dog that lives next door that always barks if anyone on the block is out he barks, and he didn't bark at all.;41.0522;-80.6041
