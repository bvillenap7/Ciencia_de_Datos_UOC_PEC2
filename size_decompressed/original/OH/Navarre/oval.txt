Cone like object near Navarre, OH;2011-01-18 23:30:00;1-2 mins;Cone like object near Navarre, OH I was at my parents house just outside of Navarre, OH last night feeding the dogs when i saw a light that looked like a falling star but it never finished falling.  It came to a stop about a couple hundred yards from the house over a field across from the house.  I thought i was hallucinating at first but it stayed in one spot for about two minutes.  It looked kind of like a cone and i couldnt make out details other than it was a bright light that seemed to throb every few seconds.  The strangest part was that it was completely silent...i heard no noise coming from it whatsoever. after hovering a good 50 feet off the ground for about two minutes it rose up higher than shot into the sky like a reverse falling star. the entire thing was the most bizarre thing ive ever seen!  I really hope you can explain this one to me as it completely freaked me out!;40.7217;-81.5312
