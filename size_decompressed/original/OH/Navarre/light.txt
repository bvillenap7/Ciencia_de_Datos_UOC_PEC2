4 lights in elongated diamond shape.  ((anonymous report));2016-09-27 06:50:00;1-2 minutes;4 lights in elongated diamond shape. Driving to work this morning (Where 251/Stump Road meets with Klick St. SW) I saw 4 lights in the sky which created an elongated diamond shape.  On one of the shorter sides of the diamond there was a red light, and on the other points it was a warmer white color.     The lights just sat in the sky as I drove by and never moved.  I couldnâ€™t make out any craft between the lights.  Not sure if there was one or not, but it was very dark.   When I looked away for oncoming traffic and looked back up, it was gone.;40.7217;-81.5312
