Rumbling Sound;2000-04-07 21:30:00;15 secs;Rumbling Sound Rumbling Sound - At 21:30 EST, I was coming back from the Dairy Mart here in town, and as I was getting out my car, I hear what I first thought were four loud shot gun blasts, but they echoed, they sounded nothing like a sonic boom.  We have been have thunder storms tonight, and at first I thought it was some odd thunder, (but there was no flash) then I hear immediately following the Booms this rumbling sound, it sounded exactly like what we used to use in the theater to make thunder sound, (a sheet of steel that was shaken).  This sound continued for several seconds, again it was no thunder.  This sound traveled from West to East as it passed over head.  There was nothing to see due to the heavy cloud cover.  It definitely sounded man made and very metallic in nature.  The second it started I thought about the descriptions I heard last night on Art Bell's show.  The one woman said it sounded man made and I think I know why, it sounded like steel, very distinctive.;41.2530999999999;-81.3391
