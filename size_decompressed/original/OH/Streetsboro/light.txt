Three bright steady red lights.;2014-04-20 22:00:00;~2 minutes;Three bright steady red lights. In the clear dark sky we saw three very bright red lights moving steadily in a large triangle formation from south to north for about 30 seconds, then one went up and out of sight while the other two kept moving at the same pace about 15 more seconds, then one went up and out of sight, then a few seconds later the other one went up and out of sight.  The lights were very bright red, no flashing and no sound.;41.2530999999999;-81.3391

They were very bright and my first reaction was that it was a strangely lit airplane.  But, I kept looking at it and it wasn't moving.  The lights were just flashing back and forth. So, I tossed it away in mind like maybe it was a tower that I just don't remember was there.  But, I kept looking out at it and all of a sudden the flashing lights stopped and other sets of dimmer lights came on and the whole thing took off quickly behind the trees.;41.2530999999999;-81.3391
cluster of bright lights in non specific formation;2021-04-15 08:40:00;5 minutes;cluster of bright lights in non specific formation Driving from Hudson to Streetsboro along E Streetsboro St, I saw a formation of lights in the sky. They were clustered in a nonspecific formation. The lights were so bright they produced a glare. They pulsed, then faded away and disappeared. After this, I turned to my mom and asked if she saw lights too, and she said she did. We checked to see if we saw the same thing, then decided we must have and began to look for them again to see if they had moved or would reappear. We thought we had lost them as we drove East in the direction of the sighting, but a few minutes later we saw them again. This time they did not disappear but we were unable to sustain a line of sight with them due to the surroundings. They had moved a considerable amount of space and were much closer to the horizon and more Southeast now. We continued to look but were unable to find a line of sight again and did not see them again. We could not pursue our search any farther because we had to! go to school/work.;41.2530999999999;-81.3391
