It was almost like a loud “lawnmower” type sound not the sound of an aircraft.  Definitely loud.  I looked up in the sky and was in awe.  It was silver/aluminum looking in color,  one large white light on the underside and was definitely triangular in shape.  It was low and was in full view over our yard.  I ran to the front door and yelled for my husband and then ran back to view it.  It flew almost straight at me, but up where a small engine plane would fly.  It had two short “flaps” that went up vertical on the two back corners “like if you made a paper airplane and put little flaps on the corners. It had no wings.  By the time my husband got outside it was going higher and circling around.  It flew fast, very fast and went behind the trees across the street and looked like it was circling back by us when all of a sudden it curved the opposite di! rection and disappeared up into the clouds out of sight.  We live directly on the Ohio Turnpike(backyard edges it) very near exit 13 and also have State Route 43 and State Route 14 very nearby.  The sky was extremely clear and visibility was perfect.  There were two or three jets up above leaving jet streams, but this object left nothing behind and it was broad daylight.  I saw it very clearly.   I am a very reliable person to tell about this as I taught school for 28 years, have lived in the same home for 20 years, work at a church and do not smoke, drink or do drugs.  I did have my glasses on.  To be honest, I kept thinking “this thing has to be a remote control”.  But then I came to my senses that it was large, fast, flying high, and was not , could not be remote controlled once I saw it fly away up into the clouds and disappear a mile or so away.  I saw it on October 26th, 2009 at approximately 6:15 p.m.   My husband did not see it up close like I did, but he did watch it glide or fly across the sky and circle around and then disappear into the clouds.  It just looked like something that should not be able to fly and I cannot fathom where a pilot would be.  It did not have windows or such and was strange to look at.I was facing west and it disappeared northwest.;41.2530999999999;-81.3391
UFO near Streetsboro, OH with loud explosion;2021-06-16 21:30:00;5 minutes;UFO near Streetsboro, OH with loud explosion Was taking my dog for a walk before bed around 9:30pm and noticed three bright lights in the sky hovering. They eventually turned into 1 bright light. To my naked eye it looked like the light was rotating. About 2 minutes later another UFO showed up, and looked like it was being chased by a fighter jet. Then there was an extremely loud explosion that shook the ground and which I felt. Not sure if it was from the jet hitting the sound barrier or what. But both ufo I witnessed had NO SOUND. All of this is recorded on video, and I’ll upload to YouTube eventually;41.2530999999999;-81.3391
