Then heard humming On the night of August 10th, 2015, my girlfriend and I were sitting outside, when we saw a bright orange light through the trees.  So we go and look at it and it starts to move south east.  It turned red, then slowly disappeared. Then about 5 minutes later, my girlfriend saw it again through the trees.   So, we called my sister out to see it and when she came out it was turning red again.  Then it flashed some multi-colored lights, then it flashed green lights, like a laser pointer.   Then, it stayed green and zig-zagged down at an alarming rate and was gone.  Then, about 5 minutes later, we heard a loud humming and at that point we went inside and locked all the doors.;41.2530999999999;-81.3391
