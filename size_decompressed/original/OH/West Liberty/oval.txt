Very fast moving object, with sudden trajectory change;2020-06-11 14:00:00;10 seconds;Very fast moving object, with sudden trajectory change I heard what I thought was a normal aircraft, but very loud. I searched the sky and saw nothing, then suddenly saw an object moving amazingly fast. I could not easily track it with my eyes, then it turned at an at least 45 degree angle with no slow down, then disappeared. It moved too quickly to get video on my phone (I was reaching for it while trying to not lose the visual).;40.2663;-83.7518
