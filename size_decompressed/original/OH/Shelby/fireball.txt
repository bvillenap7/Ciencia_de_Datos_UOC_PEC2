Massive Large Fireball Shoots from SouthWest to NorthEast in North Eastern Ohio 10/04/2013 10:48pm;2013-10-04 22:00:00;38 seconds;Massive Large Fireball Shoots from SouthWest to NorthEast in North Eastern Ohio 10/04/2013 10:48pm On October 4th, 2013, the exact Time that I seen the first sights of a giant redball flying rapidly fast was 10:48pm,  Just between Cleveland And Columbus Ohio, lays a small unheard of city called Shelby located in Richland county.  At the Time I was walking to my house to the car I seen the GIANT light coming from the South SouthWest Sky heading rapidly fast towards the North Northeast.  This was taking place so fast and only lasted around 30-45 seconds before fainting North Northeast,  However I did manage to snap a quick photo of the giant ball of fire.  The light was brighter then a Stop Sign color Red.  Very Large and, Very Bright!, I started to think about the size was about the size of a forth of the Moon, but in other terms I compared it to a airplane flying 30,000 miles above land,  An airplane to me in the sky way up there looks small, if this however was a meteor it probably was way farther up and to still be that Large in Size tells you just how large t! his object was in Size.  I really would like to thank you for reading my blog, and maybe with this information we can track down and determine what this object was and, get to the Object,  Thanks ((name deleted));40.8784000000001;-82.6540999999999
