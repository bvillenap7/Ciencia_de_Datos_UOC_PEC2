Ferris Wheel  in shape and design glass in appearance and lights lining the frame;1977-06-01 17:00:00;seconds;Ferris Wheel  in shape and design glass in appearance and lights lining the frame The UFO looked like a ferris wheel and was rotating as such with bright lights on the edge and the exterior was glass.   When we observed it at Plymouth Springmill and Shelby Ganges Road it only stayed for a few seconds then quickly disappeared into the sky.   It was located on the north east corner of the intersection.  We never told anyone about this because we thought they would think we were nuts.;40.8784000000001;-82.6540999999999
