Triangular, slow moving object with no lights and very low altitude outside of Shelby;1978-09-15 23:00:00;10 minutes;Triangular, slow moving object with no lights and very low altitude outside of Shelby I am an electronics engineer and had had a strong interest in astronomy and UFO's for about 10 years at the time of the sighting. My sister and I were going home from a friends house in Willard this nite. The sky was clear and there were many stars out. We were outside of Shelby about 2 miles so there werent many lights other than the background light from the stars. We were on a road with very rough railroad tracks so we were almost at a stand-still at the time. Something caught my eye and I looked up. It was a huge triangular shaped object I estimate to have been maybe 50 feet on a side. It traveled right over the car we were in and only about20 to 25 feet above us and moving very slow. Too slow it seemed to stay airborne. It had no lights on it and the only sound heard was the sound of something slicing through the air. No motor or propulsion noise. We  were able to make out the shape due to the background lighting. We sat and watched it for 5 to 10 minutes until it disappeared beyond some trees in the distance. It never changed direction or altitude that we could tell. It traveled from west to east at not more than 35 or 40 MPH. Contact me via e-mail if you wish. We watched it for ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));40.8784000000001;-82.6540999999999
