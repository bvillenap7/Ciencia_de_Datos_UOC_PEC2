Red pulsing light heading from south to north then heading east.;2007-02-28 23:40:00;aprox. 3 minutes;Red pulsing light heading from south to north then heading east. Traveling on state route 125 around 11:40pm after work toward Bethel from Amelia.  About half way to Bethel when I was near East Fork State Park, I witnessed a red pulsing object in the sky some distance away.  As I drove it headed from south to north crossing the road across the sky when it dropped below the trees.  I didn’t see it again until I was entering Bethel I saw it to the north heading east. It was a cloudy night & flying below the clouds.  It was a red slowly pulsing light much like you would see at the top of a cell phone tower.  Only it was moving & much higher in the sky then a cell phone tower & cell phone tower lights flash on & off.  I don’t think it was an airplane or helicopter because there were no other flashing lights on it & no strobe like lights on it.  Did anyone else witness this?;38.9418;-84.0877
Orange lights in sky Clermont county Ohio;2017-02-15 19:40:00;25 seconds;Orange lights in sky Clermont county Ohio Eastern sky in the area of Clermont and Brown county line of s/w Ohio. Approximately 30 degrees of elevation.  There were 5 lights together on the left and 2 to 3 on the right. The lights would illuminate brightly then go off completely.  The lights would alternate lighting up and going dark and were not on simultaneously for more than a second or two.  I watched this in disbelief as it was NOT an airplane or helicopter.  The lights stayed in the same location not appearing to move.  The lights gave off an orange/gold light and no noise was heard accompanying the lights.;38.9418;-84.0877
