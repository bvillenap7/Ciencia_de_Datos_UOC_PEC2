MUFON/OHIO REPORT:  Big white triangular UFO with flashing lights ... completely silent.;2004-12-16 20:15:00;5 minutes;Big white triangular UFO with flashing lights ... completely silent. Subject: White pyramid shaped object seen Date: December 16th, 2004 - 8:15 PM Witness:1   I called MUFON to report a triangular UFO in my backyard. This is the report that MUFON processed.  Summary:  Witness called me to relate her UFO sighting of December 16th at around 8:15 PM. She says she was looking out her window which faced a field behind her house. There is around an acre of land between her and the tree line where the object was seen. She states that she saw an object just above the tree line. It was like a triangle standing with the point facing up. She first thought it looked like a pyramid but it was only three sided. In the center of the object was a white light. The object looked all white. She does not know if this was due the center light or if the object was really white. On the three corners were red and green flashing lights. She says this object moved very slowly and began to rise up higher as it went out of view heading from the East going to the Northwest. It made no noise. The object was in sight for about five minutes. She said that the object was about the size of your thumb at arms length which would have made this object very large. The County sheriff's Dept. was called and the local police. Nothing had been reported to them. Filed 12/18/04 Southern Ohio Section Director MUFON   Recreation (white out and marker on photo) by witness.
