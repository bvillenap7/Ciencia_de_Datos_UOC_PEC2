rapidly flashing light with VERY erratic movements appearing to cover great distances and lasting several minutes;2003-08-21 21:05:00;5 minutes;My husband and daughter were outside at about 9:00 pm EST and began calling me (in rather excited voices)when I came out they were pointing up.  When I looked in the sky I saw a rapidly flashing light with VERY erratic movements appearing to cover great distances and lasting several minutes.  It then went lower in the sky until we could not see it anymore.  There is no doubt in my mind this was unlike any aircraft I've ever witnessed before!;38.9418;-84.0877
