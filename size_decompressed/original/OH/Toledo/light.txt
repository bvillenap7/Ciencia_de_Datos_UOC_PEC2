My companion at the time also saw this as you'll read below, but he has refrained from speaking about it.  But this is my story. I was flying right seat in a Cessna 172 from Flint Bishop MI going to Toledo Express Ohio.  I was flying with another broadcast engineer as we were returning from work in Lapeer, MI. Note the map attached to an E-mail I'm going to send.  Our flight path is in blue heading south.  The dots on Monroe County show where we deviated from our path, almost landing at Lambertville Suburban MI.  The red is the path of the objects. It was dusk and we heading South around Milan, MI, just talking about a directional antenna that we were working on.  I turned to the left to speak to my companion, Tom, and saw (5) white lights in the distance.  I made mention to Tom, and he saw them too, about 315 degrees from our direction of travel (South). We watched them for about 30 seconds, and could tell that their travel was to the west.  We called the control tower for Toledo Express and asked if he had travel ((traffic??)) in the area.  Toledo said no.  Another 30 seconds later we called again, and Toledo responded by saying, sir, we have no traffic and nothing on radar. By this time they were about 340 degrees and growing larger, which to me indicated that  were closing on the object. Just then another pilot who was in Fulton County (Ohio) came on the radio and said, I see those lights too.  I'm heading toward Metcalf (SE of Toledo), and they are 10-O'Clock to me.  Toledo Express then came back on the air and said, Gentlemen, we don't have any traffic in the area.  Tom and looked at each other, and he said, let's chase it.   I suggested that it would not be wise not knowing what it was, or if it was military, and deviated from our flight plan to waste some time and put some distance between each other.  See the dots. After we landed we talked about it, but felt that any pursuit of the story could lead to jeopardy of our pilots license. The five lights were in a formation, and it was a clear night and at it's closest I could see clouds between the objects which appeared to be about 2,000 higher than we were.  We were around 5,000 feet.  At our closest they were probably between 4 to 6 miles off our right wing.  The formation was not in any pattern that would resemble lights on an aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, although the pilot should be able to reconstruct the exact time and date from his flight logs.  The witness elects to remain totally anonymous, so we are unable to communicate with him.  We would like to invite the party who submitted the report to confirm the date with the pilot, and report back to us.  PD));41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
A point of light moving in a very unconventional flight path.;1991-08-15 22:00:00;less than a minute;A point of light moving in a very unconventional flight path. I was watching the night sky on the roof of my parents garage as I usually did in the summer. I remember watching what I thought was a satellite, a pinpoint of light crossing the sky at a steady velocity, as I watched the light, traveling from north to south, it stopped for a moment then accelerated very quickly forming a Z in it's flight path and continued to the south at the same fast pace. A report filed by someone on 8/1/91 in Toledo OH desribes very much what I saw and at the approximately the same time of night and calendar date.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678

((NUFORC Note:  Report is not inconsistent with satellites coursing to the northeast.  However, since they were flying to the northeast, it is not at all clear why they should disappear from sight.  Satellites disappear from sight during the evening hours because they are coursing AWAY from the sun.  During the morning hours, they are flying TOWARD the sun, so unless the sky is light, they should not disappear from sight.));41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678

5 bright lights / orbs floating just below clouds;2004-08-12 19:45:00;3 minutes;5 bright lights / orbs floating just below clouds There were 5 bright white lights floating indescriminantly around each other - at first I thought this was a kite with a lighted tail - but then I realized the lights were just below the cloud deck (couple thousand feet that evening) & then one of the lights started moving horizontally away from the other four.  Never moved fast.  Didn't hear anything.  Eventually disappeared up into the clouds.  Very cloudy evening (white clouds) with lower rain clouds (dark) rolling in.  These lights were just below the dark rain clouds.  Now way these were stars or meteors.  Lights were probably the size of a softball or basketball & were not part of a larger object.  My nine year old son spotted the lights first & asked me what they were.  I turned around & realized it wasn't a kite.  I then yelled over my neighbors fence where both he and his daughter saw the lights & also realized their unexplainable nature.  Neighbor mentioned seeing the police helicopter short while before I pointed out the objects.  Don't know if this was related.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
Point source of light observed for 48 min in rapid acceleration and deceleration and apparent stationary flight;2005-10-05 21:00:00;48 min;Point source of light observed for 48 min in rapid acceleration and deceleration and apparent stationary flight Observed one point source of light operating within a small area of the night sky for 48 min.  High thin overcast obscurred much of sky.  Object appeared slightly brighter than stars in area.  Object was in position when observer 1 exited building at 21:00 on 05 Oct 2005, and remained in position after observer 1 ceased observation at 21:48.   The object would remain stationary for periods of up to 30 seconds, move at velocities greater than aircraft in the area, and executed rapid changes of direction.  Object remained in area (measured by extending right arm and thumb)as 4 thumbwidths North - South and 4 thumbwidths East - West.  This area was centered about 6 thumbwidths due west of overhead.  The object was partially obscurred by the high clouds but did not illuminate them leading me to believe that it was at a greater altitude than the clouds.   Other aircraft including aircraft estimated to be at great altitude seemed to be under the clouds.  The object at times moved at a velocity greater than the aircraft observed.  The object remained still whenever aircraft were near its location.   No sound was noticed from the object, but all aircraft observed in proximity to the object's location was observed to be generating their proper sound.   Movement of the object was observed compared to stars visible in close proximity, and compared to a stationary vehicle.  Observer 2 observed the object for about 10 min and verified the above movements and activities.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
Blinkers and one white light  ((NUFORC Note:  Stars??  PD));2007-05-07 23:00:00;all night;Blinkers and one white light Occuring several evenings the past month, there have been flashing lights in the sky.  On May 7th, these events seemed to have hit a climax.  There were 20 plus blinkers, all seeming far away, except for one that hung very low in the sky and did not blink, but when a picture was taken with a digital camera, it seemed to be moving in an erratic pattern.  To the naked eye, it just looked like a huge white star, just above the treeline.  It's brightness made it suspect, so that is when we got out the camera. The blinkers flashed blue and white and there were some that flashed with a bit of red.  We noticed several other aircraft (small planes and helicopters) constantly intercepting their path.  The blinkers did not move when confronted.  The blinkers did move somewhat, but almost like they were in their own little orbit.  Several zoomed in pictures of the blinkers appeared to be a circular craft with 6 lights and one in the center. Each consecutive picture of one blinker showed a different light on the craft lit up, as if rotating lights.  I am interested to see what happens next, over the past month, there have been more and more blinkers present, and last night was really unbelievable. ((NUFORC Note:  Stars??

Unknown Lights above The Maumee River;2007-10-04 21:00:00;10 minutes;Unknown Lights above The Maumee River I had gotten a phone call on 9-04-07 at 9pm from my cousin who was down at the Maumee river behind Marshall School(near 75). He had told me to come outside and look above Marshall school and tell him if I see weird lights floating in the sky. Sure enough I was looking at the same thing he was. It was a slanted line of about 9 lights all flashing red,green,blue, and white. I ran back to the front door and called my Grandma and Grandpa  to come outside to see what we were looking at. Sure enough they seen it to. I ran back to the house and got the camera. When I came back outside 4 of our neighbors heard us saying Oh my god what is that? and came outside. They were right along with us with there cameras taking pictures. Nothing showed up on our cameras. All of a sudden the object started to lower very slowly and all of a sudden vanished. We were all just stunned. I came back into the house and downloaded the pictures. Nothing was on them. I Redid the contrast and lightened the pics and sure engough weird lights and speckles were on the pictures. I have some pictures I will be sending you.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
Round brightly lit object that changed in size.;2007-10-08 20:15:00;25-30;Round brightly lit object that changed in size My wife and I were on our front porch with 4 neighbors and I looked towards the sky and saw this amazing  bright colored light. It was about the size of a distant full moon and the lights were changing in intensity and size. Sometimes you could see a change in shape as in a fireworks shower. An expansion!  Then it would  go back to it’s original size and the intensity of the lights would dim just a bit.  For a while we were stunned!  But I grabbed the binoculars and got a better look and passed them around the porch. Everyone there saw the same thing.  I ran and got my video camera and started to record. I zoomed it to get the best possible view and proceeded to tape over 25 minutes of footage.  During the time we watched, we saw it morph shape (size and volume) erratic movements never seeming to move far from it’s original position.  The lights,blue,green,red,yellow and white were also changing.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678

It stopped quickly and went backwards for a quick second and turned back in the direction it was going and curved very quickly to a North Eastern heading.  Also a little later after this incident (maybe a half an hour) we saw two glowing lights side by side traveling verrrry fast through the sky to the north and were saw again later on coming from east to west.

That's when I noticed a bright multi-colored light. It was flashing white,blue and red. It appeared to be hoovering over downtown toledo.The lights were southeast of my location,so it is actually difficult to pin point the actual location.The brightest light appeared to be hoovering and flickering multi-colored lights. There were two similar lights that went in opposite directions and by the way they moved I could tell they were not typical aircraft like helicopters or airplanes. At one point the brightest light went completely out for a period of what seemed a minute or two. The other lights eventually came back towards the main light and then moved away again. It was totally strange. I watched them for atleast a half an hour before the main light faded off into the distance.

Amber lights seen in the distant sky, moving together before flying away.;2011-07-30 22:00:00;3 minutes;Amber lights seen in the distant sky, moving together before flying away. Driving down a road last night, I witnessed a series of round amber lights in the sky.  These lights were not directly overhead, but were in the sky, in the distance (northeast direction - towards Michigan).   These lights were large enough to guarantee they were not stars / planets, and then they began to move in the air, converging towards one another.   Since we were driving, some trees obstructed our view until we reached a place where we could continue to see the lights and actually exit the vehicle.  Once we parked, the lights began to move futher away, and within 10 seconds were no longer visible to our eyes (indicating they were moving at a significant speed).  I have never witnessed anything like that before, and I cannot speculate what else it could have been.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
White light in NW ohio;2011-08-29 23:25:00;15min;White light in NW ohio At approx 23:25 I turned off the tv and lights to go to bed. I live on the 12th floor and had sat down by the window to smoke a cigarette before going to bed.  I then noticed a light in the distance. At first I thought it was a plane because it looked similar in size and had flashing lights.  I then thought to myself that the object, if a plane, was moving at an enormous rate of speed across the sky and then suddenly it came to a complete stop and just hovered there for approx 10min before suddenly disappearing.    Growing up near an airport I've seen prob 1000's of planes and have never seen anything with that kind of speed nor have I ever seen anything come to a complete stop like that.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678

Objects in sky move at incredible speed;2013-10-20 00:00:00;8-10 minutes;Objects in sky move at incredible speed. My wife and I were out in my front yard getting some air after watching a movie.  I noticed some odd lights very high in the sky moving as if deciding where to go next.  There was one directly over us and two off in the distance circling one another as if the two of them were watching something on the ground.  You could tell they were moving in circles because of the pattern the lights were following as far as brightness and speeds of movement.  These two circled each other for a while and the other disappeared for a minute.   It then reappeared near the same spot as if the light went out then came back on a minute later. It moved forward, made a ninety degree turn, moved a bit farther then shot off in the direction of the other two at an unbelievable speed.   As it reached the other two it made a half circle around them at speed and moved on in that direction for a good distance.  We lost sight of it and as fast as it left sight it reappeared again behind us crossin! g the sky very very fast. It made no sound and left no trail.  It proceeded towards the other two again at speed and as it approached them it stopped on a dime just outside of the other two.  The two that were circling just sort of stopped and were suddenly gone.  The third again shot off at a speed that just seemed unbelievable to us.  This lasted about 8 – 10 minutes.
