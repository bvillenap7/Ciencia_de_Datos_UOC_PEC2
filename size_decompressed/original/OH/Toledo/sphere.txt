Orbs in a circle and star like objects;2012-10-27 21:15:00;45 minutes;Orbs in a circle and star like objects My neighbor was outside and noticed some lights in the sky.  There were 5 orbs flying above our street,at times over my house.  I was on my way home at the time but they had gone by the time I arrived home.    She said the 5 were in a circular formation about 200 ft high, sometimes an orb would cross to the opposite side of the circle.   Then she noticed 5 objects higher in the sky that looked like 5 pointed stars.   They travelled from south to north and disappeared.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
Swarm of jet-black spheres near Lake Erie darting around in broad daylight.;2016-07-30 19:30:00;12 seconds;Swarm of jet-black spheres near Lake Erie darting around in broad daylight. I have a similar sighting from one in Toronto.  I thought they might be buzzards or black balloons caught in an updraft.  Too freakin weird though.  We were driving in a restricted lane construction zone southbound and I started looking around because our two 3G devices jammed simultaneously.  The jammed phone is my camera, otherwise I would have photographed them, even though they disappeared after 10 seconds.  Saturday evening on I-75 just south of the I-280 ramp, east of the highway over some industrial buildings or perhaps further away, looking over near the old Jeep Parkway. 20 -30 swirling and darting jet-black spheres slowly rising like a moving swarm.  In the foreground I saw birds of similar relative apparent size that were much closer.  My thoughts went from birds, to balloons, to I don't know what they could be besides balloons, it must be a tangle in the wind.  I called attention to them, and looking back, they were gone.  I thought maybe the! y were obscured by clouds, but the way they moved it didn't make sense already because there was minimal wind at the time.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
