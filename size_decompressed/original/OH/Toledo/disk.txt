Unidentified Object Sighted;2007-06-25 00:30:00;90 min;Unidentified Object Sighted   It looked like a frisbee and had circular lights around with 1 light on top. The saucer, was hovering over the field in front of our apartment. We observed it going very slow moving to the right then to the left then back over our way. It was moving in circular motion and was very quiet. When we went to go chase it, it disappeared, when we returned to our apartment we could instantly see it again. we have been observing it for over 1 1/2 hrs and it is still in the same area and position;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
