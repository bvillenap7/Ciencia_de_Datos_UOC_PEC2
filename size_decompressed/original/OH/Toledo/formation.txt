7 orange crafts in formation with Sonic like boom sounds around the same time of sighting;2018-01-01 00:25:00;15 minutes;7 orange crafts in formation with Sonic like boom sounds around the same time of sighting 7 orange low altitude craft flying in close formation.  Sonic booms were heard in the area around the same time of sighting by different witnesses. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi there, sorry for the delay.  I am attaching pictures for you.  I unfortunately was not a witness but was told of the event as I went the opposite way home as the witnesses.  The booms were heard from my daughter and family, and the timing was spot on. As for the pictures, my friend who took them said objects were orange and low in the sky. When she saw pictures they look far away and are white.  She said they looked like they had tails.  She doesn't remember any sounds. I hope this helps and I'd like to know if any other sightings we're reported in the area. ((END ADDENDUM));41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
It looked like a large formation of white lights, probably a couple of thousand feet long, hundred feet wide.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-10-24 19:30:00;3 minutes;It looked like a large formation of white lights, probably a couple of thousand feet long, by maybe a hundred feet wide. There where so many, I couldn't count them all.  They slightly swayed back, and forth like a snake, from head to tail.  They appeared as if they entered the atmosphere, but they did not break up, they stayed in uniform, almost lined up single file .  There where others planes in the area, but this appeared to be higher.  The other planes where traveling from west to east, and Detroit Airport is about an hour north east of here, this came from slighly northwest, and traveled slightly south east.  Rather than fade away in the distance, this whole uniform of lights seemed to disappear.  It didn't make any sound, i tried to take a video of it, but i couldn't get my phone to work.  It didn't make any noise. It appeared as if a bunch of planes where grouped together single file, but like hundreds.  The whole mass of lights moved together swaying slightly like a snake.  There where no trails, no stragglers.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
