My wife and I looked up at the sky and saw a large white circle.  It remained in place for a few seconds, then it's shape distorted , flickered in and out, then finally disappeared.  The night was cloudy and windy.  The clouds moved very quickly, but the object was below them.  The clouds were moving passed it as the object stayed in place.  This was in the city, so lights were cast the downtown area, but we are a few miles from it.  No blinking lights on the object, just a white circle.  I have watched the sky for years and am an astonomer as well.  This was not a plane, a balloon (too bright in the night sky), or a planet peaking through holes in the clouds.  Whatever it was vanished into thin air.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678

Then 3 jets after another circled after it and then right by one of the jets when we were watching it movie it shot really fast like a shooting star and disappeared.  So then the jets left.  Then again from a different area the white circle appeared again moving and three more jets again.  This is our first sighting and it's scary and amazing at the same time.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
