A white triangle formation was seen along northern Ohio toll road.;2000-07-04 23:00:00;20 minutes;A white triangle formation was seen along northern Ohio toll road. I was in a 15-passenger van travelling on the 80/90 toll road heading toward Toledo after a day at Cedar Point with other summer camp workers.  It was a Saturday, and if it wasn't exactly 4th of July, it was the closest weekend because everyone was watching fireworks displays.  Soon, the big displays were gone, all but the driver, front seat passenger, and myself were asleep, and I was only seeing a few personal fireworks in the air.  I noticed bright white/pale blue lights kind of ahead of us to the left.  There were three, and if you could play connect the dots they looked to be at a perftect triangle formation, then as I watched them longer, I noticed a fourth light slightly off to the right,  and the angles of the triangle formation were changing.  They were just hovering.  The one to the right at times seemed to go the middle of the fomation, and at one point I thought I had seen a fifth one, but it was gone quickly if I did. They were mostly shining white, but at one point looked bluish.  I tried to get the driver and passengers' attentions, but they had music on and were talking, and I didn't want to wake up the two rows in front of me.  I managed to wake up a co-worker, and they looked and saw what I was seeing, agreed that it was strange, and went back to sleep.  We got closer to the objects and I thought maybe they were a series of three towers, but then I couldn't explain the fourth and possible fifth.  I lost sight of them shortly after we got off the toll road, when we entered a very wooded, piney area.  I had watched them for a long time.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
The object was triangle in shape and hovering above with no sound and black in color.;2000-09-15 00:00:00;5 min.;The object was triangle in shape and hovering above with no sound and black in color. A few nights before the sighting there was alot of helicopters in the area, above the location of my job in northwood ohio.  this particular night i looked up and saw no    helicopters in the sky ,  i mean no where. so i thought nothing of it and con- tinue my way towards the eastside of toledo.  i was driving down wales road when i notice something ahead and above the street corner that i was nearing.  it was hovering around 50 yards above the ground, it was black but it looked metal. it made no sound what so ever. i made sure because i couldn't believe what i was watching so i rolled down my window and listen very carefully. there was a hugh bright light in front of the object but it didn't shine anywhere in the ground just ahead. i notice there were no engines that i could notice in any area. it was not one of ours i know.

One light craft and 1(possibly 2) triangular crafts;2001-05-24 02:00:00;approx. 20 minutes;One light craft and 1(possibly 2) triangular crafts A friend and I were driving to my house at approximately 2 am.  We were driving south on a road near an elementary school and a small neighborhood.  We first saw a ball of light hovering above the treelines.  It seemed to me like there was a car stuck in the top of a tree with it's brights on, as we were driving past it, I noticed that is was cirular.  It then ascended straight up, and appeared to be going southwest towards another neighborhood, I then sped up to about 60 miles per hour and watched it above more treelines.  Then it disappeared.  That whole part lasted only about 20 seconds.  We talked about what was just seen, and continued driving back to my house, about 2 miles away, as we approached the airport area, we noticed a lot of activity in the sky.  We counted approximately 9 helicopters, and about 7 smaller aircraft.  As we came to a stoplight we noticed a huge triangular craft, that seemed about 1,000 ( I know it had to be more) feet above my car, I went to get out of my car, but my friend stopped me.  We could see the underbelly of this craft, it was huge!  It had red, blue, and white lights, none of which were blinking and made no sort of sound... also the craft appeared somewhat shiny. It was just heading north in a very slow fashion.  My friend, who is in the Navy said it reminded him of a Super-sized Harrier jet, minus wings.  I have no idea what that means, but that is how he described it.  This aircraft continues North and did a 180 in the sky, just like that turned a half circle and headed south, then we lost sight of it.  we were about 6 miles from my house and were still counting other small aircraft in the sky.  Right as we turned into the main road that leads to my neighborhood entrance, we was another one of the triangle craft.  ( I am not sure if it was the same one, or a different one, if it was the same, it had somehow gotten to where we were without us seeing it)  This craft seemed to be much higher than the other one, and it circled my neighborhood.  It was still visib! le when we pulled into my garage.  I personally was terrified, and called the airport.  My friend went out back and tried to see if he could see anything through the trees.  He could not.  The lady at the airport was very frantic and hung up on me.  So I did nothing else about it.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
In Toledo Ohio on June 28 at 12:45 am a Red Bowed shape object was seen in the sky.  It followed our car and then disappeared.;2001-06-28 00:45:00;15 mins;In Toledo Ohio on June 28 at 12:45 am a Red Bowed shape object was seen in the sky.  It followed our car and then disappeared. My friend and I were driving down the road when he asked me if I see that in the sky.  At first I said it was a hot air balloon but it was not.  It was red and bowed out on the right side.  It was like looking at a sail from a sail boat side view as the wind was hitting it. It was moving fast and began to come closer to the ground and to our car.  When we stopped at the stop light it stopped also.  When we turned right it turned right and followed us at the same speed.  We would slow down and so did it and so on.  As we approached the nexted stop light it stopped again.  We turned left and then it turned left.  It followed us either in front of us or to the left of us.  As we reached our destination and pulled into the parking lot it continued to follow us.  We sat in the car looking at it once we turned off the car and got out it disappeared behind some trees.  We did not see it again. Both myself and the driver are educated individuals and have never seen anything like that before.  WE have told a couple of people but no one believes us. My father and another friend were following us in two different cars the girl that was following us did not see anything.  My father on the other hand says he did not see anything but I think that he did because as soon as we got out of the car and into our meeting place he asked us what we saw. I think he saw it and is just scared to admit it.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678

5 amber lights in a V-shape seemed stationary then dissapeared;2010-06-30 23:30:00;1 Minute;5 amber lights in a V-shape seemed stationary then dissapeared Around 11:00- 11:30 pm, I was laying in bed, turned to place an item on my nightstand.  I noticed through my blinds in the sky 5 amber lights hovering from my vantage point approximately where the I-75, I -475 interchange occurs.  It disappeared within a minute of me noticing it.  My wife did not make it in time to see it.  It really freaked me out, because I know my view from my side of the bed, a whole lot of nothing, no trees, no houses, no anything.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
Triangular UFO with red/blue lights hovering for 3 hours, moving in zig zag motion every 2-3 minutes;2010-09-11 22:59:00;3 hours;Triangular UFO with red/blue lights hovering for 3 hours, moving in zig zag motion every 2-3 minutes At approximately 23:00, I let my dog outside before we went to sleep.  Someone earlier in the night had reported this as well, but I looked up to the sky and saw exactly what they did.  The aircraft was triangular in shape with red and blue lights that blinked, and every 2-3 minutes it would zig zag and return back to it’s original position. I walked back inside the house after about 10 minutes and returned about 5 minutes later, and it had moved further west.  Still rotating and hovering, the lights still blinking, I called the non-emergency hotline for Toledo, OH and reported it.  Once I walked back outside, it had moved even further west/southwest and was hovering. This object is still out there at 2:59.  I attempted to take a photograph with my camera (Canon Rebel), but was unable to capture the image.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678

We stood and watched it for a couple min and it flew over top of us, not too far above the trees.  It was a black triangle with blue and white lights.  We felt the wind as it passed.   It was mostly silent only a slight hum could be heard. It flew in the pattern of an L shape and started to descend in the distance in a wooded area.  We actually took a drive to try to find it but was unsuccessful.  When we arrived home after not being able to locate the UFO,  We noticed two fighter jets and a black helicopter flying in the direction the UFO had gone.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
