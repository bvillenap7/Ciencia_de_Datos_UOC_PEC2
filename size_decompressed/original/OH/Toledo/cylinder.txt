When almost directly overhead, a commercial airline passed on a east to west course about 3-5 miles to south, appeared to be a simlar altitude. Was definitely not meteor or satelite sighting, brightness did not fade in or out. As amateur astronomer, I ahve seen all these. Sky was clear, no clouds, bright;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
Spinning cluster of very bright red, blue and yellow lights in the Western sky.;2011-07-30 01:35:00;15-20 minutes;Spinning cluster of very bright red, blue and yellow lights in the Western sky. Toledo, Ohio  At about 1:30 am...the father of a child my daughter was babysitting, came to pick his son up. While the dad was putting the car seat in, I noticed a very bright spinning light in the Western sky which appeared to have red, blue and yellow lights. My 16 year old daughter observed the object as did my 14 year old daughter and my 83 year old mom. I had my daughter run in and get my binoculars but the object was so far away that all I could see were very bright spinning lights...very intensely bright lights tightly packed and spinning. (As I was focusing the binoculars on the object...my 16 year old said she saw  a Shooting Star zoom across the sky, North to South and that it looked like shooting stars she had seen before.)  The object moved upward, then to the North at a very steady and very slow  pace.  I  went in the house to get my good camera....when I returned outside, the object  was gone. This is the first time I have reported a sighting of this kind but I have seen this same exact type of object before...I recognize the lights and the spinning nature of them.  Previous sightings were closer and Eastward and I could make out that the shape of the object, emitting the lights, was a vertical spinning capsule shape.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
Large silver cylinder shaped object flying over swan creek area in Toledo, Ohio.;2018-06-29 11:06:00;45 seconds;Large silver cylinder shaped object flying over swan creek area in Toledo, Ohio. I was watching a bird fly over head and noticed a shiny, cylinder shaped object with a darker ring in the center flying over head.  It was very high up in the air, yet seemed as large as a commercial sized plane.  It was also going across the sky in a fairly fast rate of speed.  It also produced no sound and had no visible wings.  Where I assumed the wings should be, there was a dark ring around the object.  I did get 20 seconds of video as I stood there trying to figure out what I was watching before realizing that I needed to get my phone out to record.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
