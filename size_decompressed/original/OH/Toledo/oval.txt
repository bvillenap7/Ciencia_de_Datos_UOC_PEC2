We were all sitting outside saying goodbye after my twin daughters birthday party.  Then we all noticed that the area was lit up a bright blue.   So, we walked across the street to the football field to see if the big football lights were on, but they were not.   We then turned around to go back across the street and saw a huge orange glowing object hovering over our tree and neighbors house.   We were all amazed then it shot off in the one o clock direction and instantly gone as soon as we noticed it.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678

Orange orb type object-Star like objects almost daily.;2013-06-08 22:30:00;1 minute;Orange orb type object-Star like objects almost daily We have been seeing star like objects and reporting them since last year,and it seems they are using the north star for navigation or a guide,we live almost directly under the north star,depending on the time of year of course. None ever flash,look just like a small star,move at different speed.  Most are traveling north and south and east to west in the path of the north star,just like sailors use it.  Most seem to be going north.  Saturday we were out having coffee, barely watching the sky, and an orange orb/light came out of the east ,pulsing and emitting an orange light like a candle would in the dark,It turned 90 degree,and we saw it had two lights,both were pulsing,not flashing,no other lights could be seen,but the whole thing was glowing it was so bright,it then headed north in the path of the north star .It also appeared to get larger the more we watched it as it headed north.We could not make out a body on the object,although it wasnt far from us,it appeared slightly oval due to where the lights were positioned.As soon as it was too far too see,due to the clouds,and &quotairplane&quot coming from the the north to the south appeared ,and seemed to be in the same location/elevation,and it headed back the same way the lights came from.We could see the FAA lights on the &quotairplane&quot. Also we seen one star like object that night in a short time that we were out,and poor visibility.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
