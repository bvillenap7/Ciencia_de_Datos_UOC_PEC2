Three balls of fire, one larger than the others, flew across sky and disappeared over horizon;1999-11-16 19:00:00;15 seconds;Three balls of fire, one larger than the others, flew across sky and disappeared over horizon Three balls of fire, one larger than the others, flew across the sky and disappeared over the horizon. They travelled single-file, with the larger ball in the lead. They did not have tails, and did not look like meteors. They were white in color, bright white light, reminiscent of fireworks, but they did not die away like fireworks. The objects were seen at the University of Toledo, witnessed by 4 students (including myself)and 1 professor.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
3 balls of light, rapidly changing color, zipping off at, what seemed to be, the speed of light.;1999-11-20 14:00:00;5 Seconds;3 balls of light, rapidly changing color, zipping off at, what seemed to be, the speed of light. I Driving along I-475 towards Toledo where I-75 and I-475 meet.  It was the last 10 minutes of a 3 hour drive from Cinci where I'd been living for the last 6 months or so, travelling back to Toledo for what *I think* was Thanksgiving.  It was dusk, the sun had already set, but the sky was still somewhat illuminated.   Off to the right at about a 45 degree angle I notice 3 balls of light, each of which were somewhat stationary, rapidly changing colors from blue to green to orange to red to white, etc.  About 1 second later the balls started rapidly moving small distances (which seemed like them revving up as if they were getting ready to partake in a celestial drag race) and proceeded to zip into the sky, out of sight in a fraction of a second.  Others were in front of and behind me on the road, as well as automobiles travelling in the opposite direction, so others probably witnessed the same thing.  I feel like this is probably the most important thing I've ever witnessed in my life.  I'm 110% certain these were definitely not of our world.  They absolutely defied physics as we know it.

Fire Ball;2009-09-01 20:00:00;15 sec;At about 8pm on 9-1-09 I was sitting on my porch and looking to the north sky I noticed a large bright white fire ball moving from west to east and it looked to drop to the earth. It lasted about 15 seconds. It also had a long tail. It was about ¼ in diameter at arms length.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678

Seven Fireball-like objects spotted in Toledo, Ohio;2013-04-26 22:00:00;3-4 minutes;Seven Fireball-like objects spotted in Toledo, Ohio On the evening of April 26, 2013, Myself along with three other adults and five children were enjoying an evening on the neighbor's porch.  At approximately 10:15 p.m. one of the children yelled, UFO!  We all looked into the sky (Southeast) and saw what appeared to be a fireball making a straight line from the horizon.  Directly behind it, another appeared and then another, until there were six.  Eventually, a seventh emerged, following the same path.  They moved slowly, about the pace you would expect a very high jet to move across the sky.  They followed a straight path moving in a Northward direction and then one by one rose up into the sky and disappeared.  None of us could come up with any explanation of what these could be.  Initially, I thought they were Chinese lanterns but they were far too precise in their path and coordination.  Oddly, no sound was observed as these objects crossed the sky.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
2 bright orange lights.;2013-08-03 03:48:00;10 minutes;2 bright orange lights Noticed a bright orange light as it cleared the trees to the west of my position.   Visually tracked the object as it traversed the entire visible portion of the sky until my view was obscured by trees to the east of my position.   Object next passed directly above me and made no sound and did not display any navigational lights.   Approximately 2 minutes later a second object appeared in the west and followed the same flight path as the first object.   The objects were orange in color and reminded me the the same orange hue of a pressure sodium bulb.  The light of the objects didn't appear emanate from their  center, but appeared to surround the center like a halo.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678

I was turning into my shop parking lot when I noticed 2 extremely bright lights/fireballs in the sky, they were both slowly heading east, to my amazement one of them disappeared for a few seconds the reappeared then turned red in color, it sped up going east then vanished.   The 2nd fireball did exactly the same thing except it headed north then disappeared.

Circular ball of fire spotted in Toledo Ohio;2020-08-12 03:00:00;2 minutes;Circular ball of fire spotted in Toledo Ohio Ran outside to grab something out of my car.  As I do not generally look at anything going outside in the dark for some reason as if for me to see I turned and looked up into the sky and next to a very bright white  possibly star was a large circular what appeared to be a ball of fire.  There was a glow around the ball.  It was at a stand still for a short time then proceeded to slowly move as what i would describe slowly like a floating lantern.  It moved down slightly and then back up and moved passed trees to be out of view.  My husband a couple hours later seen the same thing 2-3 hours later in a location a few miles from the location I seen it.  Within a few minutes of me walking inside I began feeling as if my brain wasn't processing correctly and I was in what was a state of confusion as if I had experieced a head injury.  Upon further searching I found information regarding my description and UFO sightings as I have never experienced or seen anything like it.  Additionally, it appeared rather close.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
