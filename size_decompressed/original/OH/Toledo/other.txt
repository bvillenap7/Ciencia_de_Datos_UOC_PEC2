track pattern of lights;1991-08-01 22:00:00;4-5 minutes;track pattern of lights My friend, my brother and myself seen a series of lights in the sky that could have easily been described as airplane lights except for their speed and the way they flew. I cant say that there were any colors in these lights that was out of the ordinary either. They were just white. The behavior of the lights is what caught our attention. We were outside about 10:00 and noticed what can be discribed as a very small pin of light. Just like that of an airplane very high in the sky. One at a time we noticed these lights coming out of the northern sky over top of us to the south and than breifly stopping (for less than 5 seconds) and shooting at an extemely high rate of speed directly to the east. It was definately not a normal aircraft because the acceleration was almost instantanious not to mention the the perfect 90 degree angle they were making to the east. We witnessed this about seven times in row that night all following the same exact pattern over the same exact tract in the sky. None of us are astronomers or anything but common sense leads us to know that this was not a natural thing. You could tell these were controlled and determined objects. The timing and speed of the objects were all the same in a very disciplined pattern. As this event occured, the 3 of us commented on what we thought it was. Nothing we came up with then or even to this date has satisfied me. It was not your classic UFO sighting with lots of excitement and awe. What we all seen that night was not explainable.

Large almost silent craftLarge Dark colored UFO. Chased by two Ohio Air National Guard F-16's.;1998-02-15 23:35:00;2.5 minutes;Large almost silent craftLarge Dark colored UFO. Chased by two Ohio Air National Guard F-16's. On or about 02/15/98 at approximately 23:35 Hrs. I observed a large Charcoal gray to Black UFO. This craft was slowly traversing the sky from North East to South West at between 1000 to 1500 feet in altitude. There was a very low more felt then heard rumbling coming from the craft as it moved. It was approximately 100 to 150 feet long, and 100 feet wide at it's widest point. There were three strobing lights shifting from dull green to bright blue on this craft. One at each of its three tips. I would estimate the crafts origanal speed at between 150 and 200 MPH. This sighting took place within hearing distance of the local Airport extimated range to the airport is from 3 to 5 miles maybe more. As I spent 21 years in the military I know the sound of Combat Aircraft as they take off under full military power with after burners. I heard two Ohio Air National Gaurd F-16's take off from the Toledo Express Airport and head in the direction of the Unknown. Both F-16's passed directly over head I could clearly see they were both armed with two each AIM-9 Sidewinder Air to Air Heat Seeking Missles. As the two F-16's approched the craft it looked to me as if they were attempting to get a weapons lock. The large Unknow suddely increased it's speed to well over supersonic but without the resultent sonic boom. It then tilted upward at I would say an almost 90 degree angle and continued to excelerate. Both F-16's attemped to stay with and chase the craft but they were quickly out distanced. I continued to watch as they both broke off persute and circled back returning to their base at Toledo Express Airport. Again I state that the craft made a very low possibly subsonic rumbling sound that I felt more then heard. I would discribe it's shape as the same as the expiremental XF-16XL the Cranked Arrow (An expierimental Delta wing configuration of the F-16 Fighting Falcon. I should also note that my 21 years in the military was spent in and around the intelligence community. For 20 of thoes years I held a Top Secret Security clearance with several special compartmented acsesses granted. For the last 6 years I have worked as a private security officer and investigator. I do not know if there have been any other reports of this craft nor do I know if anyone else saw what I saw. I watched the newspapers and the television for any reports of this incident and I have yet to see any it is almost as if it never happend. And this concerns me more then if there had been reports and people were made to look like boobs for reporting it.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
Midnight car drive, unexpected visit by an object;2001-02-22 23:30:00;5.5 sec.;Midnight car drive, unexpected visit by an object We(3 of us)  were in the car driving to nazerath hall.

UFO spotted over Toledo, OH, USA. Arc shaped and semi-tranparent.;2009-04-16 21:45:00;10 seconds;UFO spotted over Toledo, OH, USA. Arc shaped and semi-tranparent. I was standing outside with my mom and fiance.  My mom was in the car already and by the time she got out it was gone.  But my fiance saw it first, she looked up and said What’s that?. I thought she was talking about the big dipper because that's where she was pointing, so I said That’s the Big Dipper. and she said no that.  Then I saw it looked huge, it was semi-transparent it was arc shape, like  this ( but huge. I couldn't judge well its height very well id say 3000ft up.  It looked like if sat on the ground it would have been several football fields in length at least.  Despite its size it made no sound I could hear, I have good hearing, and so does my fiance.  I'm 20yrs old, and she’s 18. It was quiet outside as well.  It was moving slowly compared to normal aircraft. My mom started the car and the car lights came on, I yelled at her to turn the car off and she did but by the time I turned back around it was gone. My fiance says she thought it kind of flapped slightly like a large slow moving bird mind you she agreed on its size, she said If it was a creature it was still the size of several football fields. The best way I can explain it is if you took a paper plate, cut out the middle leaving only the curved edges, then cut out a quarter section of the edge giving you a rainbow arc shape, now make it see through, like glass. I could even see the stars through it. I kept looking for it hoping to see it again, but I doubt I will it looked pretty set on its course. I didn’t see it flap and she said it wasn’t very noticeable movement, I think since it was transparent the way it moved in front of the stars did give an appearance of it rippling, I think that might have been what she saw. I hope someone else besides us saw it, it was an amazing sight. Even if it didn’t last long.  As for us, I am a 20 year old Male. I have lived in this city most of my life. I have very good vision, and hearing.  My Fiance is 18 years old, and has also lived here most of her life.  She also has excellent vi! sion and hearing. I'm a normal adult, I spend my time taking care of my dad and hanging out with my friends. My fiance is a senior in High school, and will be graduating this year. We live in a normal city, and I have never seen anything like this as long as I’ve lived here. This is no joke or hoax, if I wanted to make something up id write a book, this was the first site I found to report this so that’s what im doing. Thank you for you time whoever reads this.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
3 horseshoe appearing lights attached to a military type aircraft;2010-07-04 00:00:00;20 sec;3 horseshoe appearing lights attached to a military type aircraft I saw what looked to be red glowing horseshoe shape lights coming from the northwest about tree top level.   It flew over the garage and appeared to be some military type aircraft shape flying at a high angle of attack (almost vertical) maybe the flaps were arranged for slow flight.   The only sound it made blended in with the natural sounds of wind only it was like a woooosh , but soft.  It was heading in a southeasterly direction.   My first thought was  it was from the 180th, but maybe it wasn't one of ours.  Or maybe it was a training mission...do not know.   It did appear to have some way of being hidden from veiw and at times all you could see was the red lights (3) and occasionally, I did see the shape of the aircraft because of the contrast in the sky...the aircraft appered to have no other lights on but the 3 red ones in the back which could have been maybe heat from the engines.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678

It got slightly to the west of my position and approximately 8-10 objects appeared in the line of light.  All were in a straight line except one of them.  The other was along the lead one in the line.  The light was more like a glow around the formation.  The objects seemed to have sort of a hex shaped front end with straight sides with rounded off corners in back of objects.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
Looking at at the sky watching a couple hawks circling the air. I noticed a slow moving bright object in the sky.;2017-05-14 16:30:00;10 minutes;Looking at at the sky watching a couple hawks circling the air.  I noticed a slow moving bright object in the sky.  Since we were watching hawks, I had a pair of binoculars and tried to get a better look.  I saw a circular shape center with what appear as two arms out with small object attached reflecting in the sun.  Object was to the east with the sun to the west.   I could not get a good photo with my iPhone, but did take a photo of the sky if anyone can clean up the image.   In the evening we can see satellites going overhead, but this looked too low.  With the amount of airplanes that fly overhead this looked too high.  It was hard to judge without another object in the vicinity.  My only thought is that it is a balloon, a satellite or something else.  I was hoping that someone else may have saw it.  Just seemed to float by for roughly 10 minutes.  Conditions were sunny, clear skies, light breeze.  Just hope that someone else saw it, and can give a good explaination.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
Brilliantly shiny and white dome outside of Toledo, OH;2018-01-20 03:30:00;3-4 minutes;Brilliantly shiny and white dome outside of Toledo, OH Driving on I-80 West outside of Toledo, OH, noticed an object hovering at about 5 times the height of a large communications tower in the dark night sky. It was a dome with a rod emanating out of the top.  The rod was about 1/6th the height of the dome portion.  At the top of the rod, there were two smaller curved rods pointing in opposite directions. The outside of the dome was brilliantly shiny.  The outline of the dome itself was so bright, it almost appeared to be electrified.  Inside the dome, the composition appeared to be milky in color and without a defined shape.  The whole affair reminded me of something you might observe under a microscope. Four times before in my life, I have seen what I truly believe were UFOs (either from the beyond or perhaps made here).  This one, however, I seriously wonder if it was something manmade (communications apparatus?) that I just do not have the knowledge to identify.;41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
Fake plane.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible military transport aircraft at low altitude??  PD))((anonymous report));2018-03-04 12:57:00;0:15;Fake plane. My wife child and I were leaving church and the car started and had other cars behind us forcing us to wait for a minute.  I was facing East, when looking up for no reason other than just to to see if there were any clouds.  I didn’t see a shadow, hear a noise, see anyone else looking up, or anything to cause me to look up or expect to see anything other than blue sky. I saw a flat “battleship-gray” dual-engine military cargo plane banking from a southwesterly direction to a westerly heading.  I would not have thought anything about it if not for the fact it was obviously very low, slow, and miniature in scale.  It was also silent. Flight radar 23 screenshot proves new planes were in the vicinity. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible military transport aircraft at low altitude??
