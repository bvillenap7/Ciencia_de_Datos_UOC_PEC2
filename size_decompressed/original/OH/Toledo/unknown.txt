UFO at the Mall;1998-08-15 20:00:00;15 min;UFO at the Mall Some friends and I were going to the grocery store and looked into the sky and thought we saw a comet.  There had just been a comet in the news not too far before that (Hale-Bopp) but we didn't remember seeing anything about another one.   Then as we got closer to the stoplight, it started to move.  It went in all directions, kind of slowly, like it was watching us.  We kept our eye on it, and continued to the store.  There is a mall on the way to the store (Northtwone Mall) with a street that goes around it, so we turned to drive around the mall, that way we could drive slowly and keep an eye on it.   It followed us of course, and seemed to get closer.  There were people at the mall, about to go to the movies, so we asked them if they saw it and 2 guys said yes.  This is the first time that you could see the shape of it because it was getting close.  It was kind of a saucer, but there seemed to be some kind of gear hanging out of the bottom, like landing gear, and lights.   We stopped at the corner of Detroit and Alexis and it turned slowly and hovered down Alexis Road.  It seemed to hover righ tover the traffic, this is why I always wondered if anyone else ever saw it, beseides us 5. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  Hale-Bopp was most prominent in March 1997.  PD)));41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678

We have been seeing UFOs over our area for the last several weeks.  They are hovering to the north, south and west.  There were 12 a few weeks ago and 6 tonight.  They have a pulsating red, green and blue light flashing.  We also saw one moving for the first time.  Was moving in a straight path very quickly.  We see them clearest right after the sun has completely set.  A few weeks ago I saw a white object touch multi-colored object then move away.
