it was black and seemed to get smaller;2004-01-04 17:00:00;10min;it was black and seemed to get smaller im a part time college student.on my way home from school this evening i noticed several contrails in the blue evening sky and thought it was very unusual.my trip home was only 15 minutes.when i was about 10 minutes into my trip home i looked up into the sky and saw an unusual contrail that was almost black in color opposed to the white.my estimate of the size of the object would be about the same as an f-18 that the national gaurd uses around here.i watched this thing with a very short contrail get smaller in sizeas i got closer to home. it seemed to be inverted,like the nose was pointed toward the earth.the most exciting thing about this sighting was when i was about 1-2 minutes from home i saw another black line shoot across its contrail horozontally then disapear.when i got home i looked up and no longer seen this object. ((NUFORC Note:  The description sounds to us to be consistent with a typical contrail.  PD));41.6586462389382;-83.5995566371678
