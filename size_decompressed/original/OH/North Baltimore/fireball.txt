Video of &quotflaming&quot object, no trail or noise, streaking across the sky very fast.;2015-10-16 13:30:00;Split second;Video of &quotflaming&quot object, no trail or noise, streaking across the sky very fast. It was the Fall of 2015, I believe mid-October, I was in my vehicle at the CSX Intermodal Rail Yard in Henry Township, Ohio, two miles west of North Baltimore, Ohio.  I am in the habit of driving out to the intermodal and shooting random video of activity in and around the yard (opened in 2012).  I don't always view my footage, unless something extra was observed. I didn't see anything so I didn't view this tape until some number of days, maybe months later.  And I noticed the bright flame streaking through my view, as the camera was focusing in on some flying geese.  I have always been a UFO buff observing a couple of interesting events over the years.  But nothing really reportable and no photo/video.  For whatever reason I have procrastinated doing anything with this video, figuring it probably isn't anything anyway.  Well, I ran across it again today and happened to come across your site as well (from Facebook).  So I will emai! l the video over.  Please, let me know what you think.  Email is the best for me to communicate.  I get crap Verizon phone reception! Thank you for your time!
