Was causing my digitial cable to reset and lights to dim and annoyed me. I went to see if my cable & power line were sagging due to the weather, it had been raining and the sky was full of clouds as the remnants of one of the hurricanes passed over. As I looked out my window I saw in the distance a very intense almost neon blue light flashing against the sky.  Each time the light flashed everything electrical stopped.  By my approximation the light appeared to be coming from the Perry Ohio Nuclear Power Plant (approx. 25 miles away).   The light flashed just like lightning except it looked like it was orginating from the gound and reflecting up against the clouds.  The last flash was the most intense lighting up the whole horizon and included red and orange as well as blue light and what appeared to be a fireball.  After that no more lights and no more power disturbances. Apperently others saw the light and reported it on the radio next morning WTAM 1100.  I thought it would be good to report the power interruptions as well.  I called the power company the next day to see if anyone else reported power distrubances in my area and they would not tell me.  I have never been through anything like this before and will never forget that light.  It definatelly was not lighting.;41.6608999999999;-81.4421999999999
