Labor Day 2009, overlooking Lake Erie with object that appears to have come out of the water!;2009-09-07 15:00:00;0;Labor Day 2009, overlooking Lake Erie with object that appears to have come out of the water! I took a picture on a clear day, and the Lake Erie was like glass.. I took a picture of a sailboat that was about 1/4 mile off shore.  The 1st picture I took on my digital camera had a Jet Ski in the front running in front, so I waited about 5 seconds and took another picture of this sailboat.  There were no other boats out that day around there.  I used the photo as wallpaper on my PC.  Then I happened to notice something creepy coming out of the water behind the sailboat.  There is even am upward spray of water.  It look like a UFO that is tilted on a slight upward direction.  Its oblong, darker on the bottom, lighter on top.  I dont know what I have caught on camera, but it was NOT a blimp or plane.  I didnt NOT make changes tothe picture.  I have made copies on a 8X10 and CD.;41.8014000000001;-80.9423999999999
