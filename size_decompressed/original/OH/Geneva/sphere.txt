White sphere follows driver;2003-05-05 05:00:00;30 minutes;White sphere follows driver My grandmother was on her way to work following her routine route, and as she pulled out onto a road, she saw a bright white sphere about 1,000 feet in the sky. As she drove down the road she grew uneasy, and didn't know what to think. She felt compelled to stop the car and look at it further. As she drove, she noticed the white sphere was following her, and came about only 100 feet from her car. Every time she looked into her rear view mirror, she noticed the sphere was getting closer. She made it to work on time, and as she left her car to walk into the building where she worked, the sphere was still there. She noticed the sphere had a haze around it. She reported no Missing Time situation, and she heard no sound from the sphere. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));41.8014000000001;-80.9423999999999
