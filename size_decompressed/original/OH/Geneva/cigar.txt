Enormous Cigar shaped craft, no wings, no windows, no sound, incredible rate of speed, over Lake Erie, in Ohio, chased by helicopter.;1993-05-05 09:00:00;4-5 mnutes;Enormous Cigar shaped craft, no wings, no windows, no sound, incredible rate of speed, over Lake Erie, in Ohio, chased by helicopter. I arrived at work and parked my car, and proceeded to walk, heading north across the parking lot to the automotive repair shop that I work in. As I was walking , I noticed a very large cigar shaped craft in the sky approx. 10,000 - 20,000 feet up in the air.  It was heading east over Lake Erie at an incredible rate of speed. I watched it for a few minutes to make sure I was actually seeing this. It was an enormous craft, much larger than any conventional aircraft I have ever seen, I presume it would dwarf a B-52 bomber ten fold. I could not see any wings or windows on this craft. It made no audible sound. Upon sighting this craft I yelled for my other 2 co-workers to come and see this craft. They ran outside and spied it just as it left our field of vision. Within 30 minutes went outside to watch a very large helicopter, unmarked and solid grey, with a very large gun fly over our area heading northeast to Lake Erie. For the next 3 months we witnessed Apache helicopters flying patrols along the lake, always flying east, 3 helicopters in each patrol. After a few months the patrols stopped and we never heard or witnessed anything else out of the ordinary. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  The gun on the U. S. Navy helicopter may have been a refueling probe, which projects forward from the fuselage a considerable distance, so that a refueling hose does not interfere with the main rotor.
