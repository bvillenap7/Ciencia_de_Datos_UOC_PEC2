My partner and i woke at about 5:15 a.m. to our dog barking upward at the sky out our the bay window, in-which brought our attention to notice what looked like a bright hovering star made of multi-color pulsating lights just SE of us.  The unidentifiable object seemed to be a solid to our eyes (with pulsating red, white, bluish green lights).   After a few minutes of staring, we decided to video the unbelievable sighting.  Prior to that, the object seemed to hover and slowly change position in a hovering motion..  When zooming in upon the video taken the object looks more orb/sphere like, than what we witnessed w/our naked eyes.   During the event we saw 3-4 helicopters/planes go near the object then abruptly change direction nw(notsure if it was the same helicopters/planes that just circled around).   We both were mesmerized by the object and lost sight of it, especially with the multi color aura like beams that emitted from it, and only when checking the newly taken! video of the UAP to see if it recorded well on our IPhone 6/along with trying to view so we could get a better look at what it was.  We both have experienced other uapâ€™s (2 to be exact in the past) and odd synchronized events that we could not explain, but nothing that we were able to get pics/video of and as mesmerizing as this.;41.8014000000001;-80.9423999999999
