like shooting star or meteorite but had a rather long tail.;1998-09-28 04:39:00;5-10seconds;like shooting star or meteorite but had a rather long tail. while driving in a west direction I saw what looked like a shooting star or meteor with a longish(3 ft.) tail go from northwest to southwest. it was white in color. what I noticed most was the tail and the fact that it lasted between 5-10 seconds. wasnt as quickly gone as most shooting stars I have seen and I've never seen one with that great a tail.The head of this was about the size of 2 to 3 big stars.It was about midway or a bit more above the horizon near to a bright star -maybe a planet- that was in the south western area of the sky.This didnt appear to be craft-like in any way or to hover but I am writing because I was impressed with the size and tail which I have never seen as big on a shooting star if that is what this was. I am saying the object emitted other objects because it emmitted the tail.I don't know what a meteor's size would be normally so maybe this is typical- I  myself have just never seen anything like it.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
large, slow moving green fireball with green and yellow tale, dropping reddish sparks, moving from south/south west towards north/north;1999-11-16 19:00:00;9-11seconds;large, slow moving green fireball with green and yellow tale, dropping reddish sparks, moving from south/south west towards north/north east While driving Interstate I-275 west bound, at approximate mile marker 58, I observed a large green fireball moving from a direction from south  by south west towards north by north east at 7:10 pm est. This object had a tale extending at least four moon widths in length dropping material of a reddish color as it traversed very slowly across my field of view. I watched and slowed down as 9 to 11 seconds of time elapsed, and the object seemed to not change in intensity or size, but went over the northeastern horizon. The magnitude of this object rivaled the half moon present at the time. An accurate indication altitude was not readily apparent to me at the time, but the feeling I got was that it was large and not high up, moving very slowly for a meteor. My crude estimate of altitude is 3-4 miles.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Bright green fireball 20-25deg. above horizon the size of 1/2 thunmbnail at arms length traveling s.west to n.east for 25 seconds. Brok;1999-11-16 19:15:00;25seconds;Bright green fireball 20-25deg. above horizon the size of 1/2 thunmbnail at arms length traveling s.west to n.east for 25 seconds. Broke up into 4 pieces. Approx. 7:00-7:15pm Tuesday evening I was driving west on West Chester road, (about 12 miles north of downtown Cincinnati, OH) when I noticed a Bright white fireball in the western sky. Knowing that the Leonid showers where near I thought Wow, this could mean they are starting early and should be very good tonightbut quickly realized that the Leonids would be from the East, not the West. It quickly turned bright green and grew to the size of about 1/2 thumbnail at arms length. An orange tail stretched out behind the fireball to a length of approx. 1 1/2 to 2 fists when held at arms length. It arched across the night sky in front of me from the left of my windshield to my right passenger window and appeared to break into 4 large pieces, (now yellow) and drop behind the trees to my right. It appeared very low in the sky and most remarkably, it seemed to move in slow motion for a metiorite. To illustrate just how long it was in the sky, about 1/2 way through its flight, I had time to slow the car down and remove my seat belt to watch it. Just then I saw the headlights of another car approaching from the other direction and since this was a winding country road, I thought I had better pay more attention to my driving and proceeded to drive past this approaching car and when I pulled off the road to see if I could still see the tail, I was shocked to see it still traveling above the tree line over my right shoulder.                            I am a photographer, 41 years old, 20-10 vision, and have watched the Persius metiorite shower every year for the last 18 years from a beach in North Carolina. I have seen metiorites impact in the ocean and have seen them so close that my wife and I could hear them breaking up. None have ever lasted for more than a few seconds. This reminded me of the film of the re-entry of the U.S. space station over Australia many years ago. This was the most impressive event I have ever seen. Most of the city saw the object and the radio, (700 WLW) talked about it for the rest of! the nig ht. Reports included the 5 air traffic controllers at Greater Cincinnati Airport saying that they were frozen by the sight of this and that they had never seen anything like it in their 15 years in the tower. When asked if it appeared on radar one replied, (sic) No, I think it was was too fast for the radar to pick up, but when pressed he replied that he was too busy watching it out the window to look at the radar scope. I wonder if they will review the tapes. Tim Headrick, the weatherman on our Chanel 12 WKRC-TV said that he also saw the object and it appeared to him to be at least the size of a semi tractor-trailer. He commented that it could be one of three things 1) Leonid metiorite shower 2) Re-entering Space Junk 3) Something else infering a UFO You might like to talk to him.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

Radiating, pulsating, fiery object observed in the cincinati night sky!  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Venus.

It appeared to be a a huge radiant object in the distant that remained stationary for at least 20-25 minutes, my wife witnessed the object as well and the object was subsequently recorded on video. i could not positively discern the exact shape of this object but if i were to make a reference point, it resembled the vehicular object depicted in the 1st superman movie that brought superman from krypton to earth, i say that not to sound hoaxy but merely as a description. i reside  southern ohio (cincinnati) and the object appeared in the southwestern portion of the horizon. it was a pretty clear nite and this object was clearly no celestial body based on the way it behaved. at times it appeared as giant pulsating ball of light. i noticed a lot of manmade aviation activity in the proximity of this object. this is clearly visible on the tape i made. i called a friend over the phone who resides not too far and he along with other witnesses observed similar activity. after about 25 minutes the object simply diminished in the distance to where it was no longer visible.

Four low flying fireballs over Cincinnati.;2009-11-13 19:00:00;10 min;Four low flying fireballs over Cincinnati. I was driving home from work on Friday the 13th of November 2009. At around 7:40 pm near my home in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Westwood I viewed from the road while driving my car what looked like 3 flaming objects descending to Earth. As CKY is just across the Ohio River and a major flight path goes over my neighborhood I assumed it was a mid air explosion of a commercial aircraft. As I drove towards where the objects seemed to be descending I saw there were actually four burning fire balls moving in formation. These were not burners, they were visibly flaming and left 'tails' as they moved. It was an irregular motion and I watched them until they moved out of view. There was a lot of other aircraft activity in the sky as well, including a low flying(and fast) military aircraft that was discernably terrestrial and several civilian aircraft mentioned above that flew much higher and served as a point of reference for both fireballs and military plan. I ca! n still hear aircraft flying overhead in my apartment as a write. Amazing. I also got a poor picture on my camera phone though it does reveal the 4 orbs.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Four reddish-orange lights traveling slowly across the sky in Cincinnati, OH;2010-10-31 19:15:00;4 minutes;Four reddish-orange lights traveling slowly across the sky in Cincinnati, OH On Halloween evening, my daughter, my neighbor and I were standing at the end of my driveway handing out candy to trick-or-treater’s. As we were facing north, all three of us observed a line of 4 reddish-orange circular lights emerging slowly from behind the trees to the north. I saw what appeared to be a 5th reddish-orange light trailing the other four at a somewhat greater distance, but when the group of 4 emerged into our line of sight I no longer saw the 5th light. The 4 lights traveled as if they were attached by a string, that is, the distance between them did not vary at all as they moved. Perhaps this indicates that they were attached to a craft of some sort, but none was visible from where we stood.. The lights traveled very slowly, from right to left, across our line of sight in a westward direction. As they moved far to the left they dimmed and flickered out, one by one, until they all disappeared. I tried to take note of whether they passed behind a cloud I don’t think that was the case. Relative to the diameter of a full moon, the length of the formation appeared to be about 6 times that diameter. The angle above the horizon was approximately 55-60 degrees as best I can determine. Each of these “orbs” was about 4 times larger than the brightest star I’ve ever seen. None of us heard any sound from this craft, if that’s what it was, but given the distance from us, one wouldn’t likely hear any sound. My neighbor dismissed this whole thing, saying they were “balloons”, but that doesn’t make sense. I’ve been thinking about this and decided it’s definitely out of the ordinary, so decided to report it. My daughter agrees.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
9 red fireball-like objects hovering in line formation up and down and at angles accelerating quickly and descending slowly.;2012-01-22 23:10:00;5 mins;9 red fireball-like objects hovering in line formation up and down and at angles accelerating quickly and descending slowly. I was lying in bed next to my girlfriend and next to an east facing window at roughly 11:10pm EST 01/22/12, Downtown Cincinnati when I saw a flash of light from the left corner of my eyes.  I turned my head, looking southeast out the window and noticed a round orange/red globe/orb-like object floating along without sound traveling northwest toward my condo.  My girlfriend and I were astonished by its ability to drift, sometimes moving up or down unlike that of a helicopter or private jet! The object was coasting at a pretty good clip.  At this point I climbed higher into the window to get a better less inhibited view through the glass as opposed to through glass and outer screen. At that moment we noticed another object just like the first following a short distance behind approx ½ mi. Then came another and another.  Those that followed totaling 5 or 6 more were performing maneuvers unlike the first three and more peculiar.  My girlfriend again pointed out two more circling each other to our southeast while those behind them were hovering very close to the tops of the city skyscrapers around the corner of Seventh and Vine and then finally nearing the ground hovering straight down at roughly Race and 9th St. Downtown Cincinnati.  The one that initially appeared to land on a building top came slowly down at that junction and out of sight once again. I proceeded to film those closest to the downtown buildings rather than following those who were in a straight path out of sight north and west of my home.  The angle from my vantage point to the objects’ was somewhere between 20 and 45 degrees from the ground.  They were straight up halfway across the 8 or 9 Cincinnati City Blocks from east to west on a map. The remaining 2 objects exploring the downtown building tops eventually in just under a minute began to make their way due north up the I71 corridor and out of site.  The objects’ diameter appeared to be a car’s length maybe slightly longer.  I estimated by the size of the object that appeared to land on the building in relation to the size of the rooftop.  We were not sure what to do exactly however with a little research we found the NUFORC.  We have 2:44secs of footage taken from my Droid Camcorder to accompany this report.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

I was at a farm festival event standing on a small hill for children to climb.  I looked over to the south i think and I saw a bright orange light in the sky.  I thought it was just a firework so i watched it.  It soon broke into 4 individual hovering lights. They were lined up in a vertical position and they did not move for a second.   Then, one by one, they started to move horizontally back and fourth, fading in and out.   They seemed to stay at the same altitude through this phenomenon.   I kept watching and they soon stopped moving back and fourth and they rejoined the vertical line.  They then went back into one and the bright orange light dimmed until I couldn't see it anymore.   I wasn't the only one that saw it and since the lights stayed at the same altitude for almost the entire duration of this event, I don't believe it could be a hoax of any kind.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

Cincinnati.;2014-06-27 22:20:00;30 seconds;I went outside apx. 1020 pm, my second sighting in the same area of my backyard in two first time a major close one big green disk that hovered over my house green craft in July 2012.   Any way i was looking up in the same area as the last time and noticed a orange ball just bouncing up and down then vanished.  Since the 7/1/12 whenever i go outside i pay attention snd yet a feeling that i get nervouse over what i will see.   Then a third sighting apx. 6/30 i was outside but sitting on my front rs porch and i saw two orange glowing lights again.  They seemed to be headed in the direction of my house side by side moving in a straight direction.  Then changed direction moving south instead of west towards me.  They stayed side by side then just vanished.  I called mufon and made a report here two years ago.  A person from my area was supposed to come over to my hom because of the major sighting and  investigate it due to 3 of us had such a bazzar encounter two years ago and it was hovering over my house for several minutes actually 15 to 20 minutes but he never bothered to come and interview me.  So this time i am not bothering with mufon and reporting it here instead. That upset me. Especially since the home base for mufon is here in the Cincinnati area.  I just know now when i go outside i always look up and yet get afraid of what i will see due to such a close encounter i had two years ago on the same date.  That ufo was about 150 to 200 ft over my house and i think or feel like it knew we were paying attention to it. That was a green round disk plus orbs. Moved very slow and hovered right over us.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

The object was bright and far enough away to look like a Star. But it was falling far too quickly to be one There was 1 object. The object was bright red/orange. It was very far away but moving very fast.  The object appeared to be falling. I do not think it could’ve been a balloon or a flaming object of some sort that the average person could’ve put in the sky to make it appear to be a UFO. The object was falling far too quickly but took too long to fall for that to be the case.  My positioning was about a half mile southwest of the middle of the city. I was personally facing just east of south. About 5 o’clock (if 6 o’clock is south and I’m at the center of the clock).  I stared at the object for a few minutes from my deck after someone pointed it out. I then pulled out my phone and took a video.  The object appeared to me to be on fire as it seemed to flicker. It was potentially falling at a fast rate very far out.  I have seen meteor showers, Venus, and once I believe a falling satellite. I do not think what I saw was any of these three things. I searched online to see if anyone else saw this and I made a post about it to my local subreddit. No one had any input or news on what it could’ve been.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
