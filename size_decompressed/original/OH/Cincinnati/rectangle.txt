Black Flat Object with a Luminous Light hovering in the sky...;2008-02-22 20:50:00;3 mins;Black Flat Object with a Luminous Light hovering in the sky... We were exiting a resturant in a plaza. We saw this retangular flat object that was levitating in the sky. It was not that high up. At first we thought it was a balloon or a bird. As we looked closer we all saw that the object was in deed a flat retangular shape with a luminous circle around it.  It kept swaying back and forth in an upward motion.  At first it was hovering over the same spot but then it continued to get higher. This went on for about two to three minutes and it disappeared. We actually could not believe what we were seeing. I typically do not believe in this type of stuff but there is NO other explanantion for this object. The fact that it was dark outside and we could see this black object floating in the air, leeds me to believe that this was something of a different nature. I do not know if this was indeed a UFO, but it was not normal whatever it was.  Please, I am not crazy. There were 3 of us, completely sober, who all witness the same exact object and motions. I did try to take a picture of the object. Only if you hold the carmera a certain way can you see the glow of the object.  It was a white circle around it. My flash on the camera would not work so I guess the black object did not come through. I just really want some type of explaination as to what this was? Have others reported this type of object before? I am freaked out right now.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
low flying, slow moving retangular object making a low rumbling noise.;2008-03-15 23:45:00;3 minutes;low flying, slow moving retangular object making a low rumbling noise. Driving down Kemper Road (a small road running between two neighborhoods) at approximately 11:45 p.m., three friends and I heard a low rumbling noise. We looked up and saw a flying object. It was flying lower to the ground than an airplane or helicopter should. It was moving very slowly. It was rectangular in shape and had lights on all 4 corners. The lights were what looked like to be a mixture of orange and purple. The rectangle also had a funnel shaped object on top, sort of like a funnel to a tornado siren.
