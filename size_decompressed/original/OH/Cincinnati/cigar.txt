My nieces and nephews were assigned an astronomy project, it was city-wide,  and the subject was to study the different phases of the moon. Heavy cloud cover the night before had hidden the moon, also there were no entries on my calendars for a moon viewing. I awoke early, it was a cold, crisp, clear morning. I was restless, I always look out the window. The moon was the biggest that i had ever remembered, it looked as if there was a red spot on it, I got my binoculars but couldn't make out the spot. Anyway, dawn was approaching, the rays of the sun were visible, thought I was going to see the moon and the sun in the same frame. As i was watching the rays of the sun come up, a cigar shaped thing, moving extremely fast, came up from either a stationary position or a hovering position, and flew right across the face of the moon at a 45 degree angle. I thought, you've just seen a ufo. I called my father and told him.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
cigar shaped UFO;2008-06-11 13:00:00;2 mins;cigar shaped UFO Saw a cigar  light metal shiney in color craft about 2000 - 3000 ft up  thought it was a plane at first  because we have a airport somewhat close.   After a minute or 2 I noticed that it wasn't moving.  The craft was just hovering.   As I was watching it it just shot away at a high rate of speed.  It was so fast I almost couldn't react to it.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
White cigar shaped object.;2015-05-26 11:00:00;30-40 seconds;white cigar shaped object A coworker and I went outside around 11 to take a smoke break.  I looked up to see a long white/ silver tube flying north.  I asked my coworker do you see that?  He said dude, that doesn't have a tail.  He was referring to the absence of a tail wing which would obviously make it an airplane.   We watched it for about 30 seconds before it was out of view.  Though it was flying, it wasn't really flying.  The way it moved was effortless.  I know that sounds weird but it moved like nothing I had ever seen.   The object looked longer than any passenger jet.  Both ends of the object were circular or if you could imagine the ends of it were capped with half spheres.  It made no noise.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Silver cigar shaped craft that vanished near Cincinnati;2019-10-18 12:45:00;30 seconds;Silver cigar shaped craft that vanished near Cincinnati Driving East on route 50 I seen what first appears as a reflection of sunlight off a passenger airplane but as it tilted it looked like a giant silver cigar with nothing on its sides, no windows, wings or markings. After a few moments the object just vanished. It didn’t not appear to be traveling, it only tilted. The sky was fully visible with no clouds or obstructions close to the craft. I’m only documenting this in case anyone else in the area seen it. I have never seen something just disappear which has troubled me.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
