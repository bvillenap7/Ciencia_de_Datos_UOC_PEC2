Glowing orb floating at treetop level;1992-07-10 18:00:00;2 minutes;Glowing orb floating at treetop level One evening, at about 7 o'clock PM, I was looking out my window over my kitchen sink as I rinsed some dishes.  A glowing, reddish orange orb was floating through the trees in my backyard.  It was about 30 feet from where I stood and just about at my eye level. The orb looked about the size of a giant beach ball. Our yard fell away steeply just feet from the foundation.  I watched this for several seconds as my brain tried to compute what I was seeing.  I watched as it maneuvered through the dense trees, yet never came into contact with one.  It then emerged from the other side of the woods and slowly climbed in altitude until it cleared the hill on the other side of the woods. It then disappeared in the distance.  I listened to the local news reports and scanned the paper for days to see if anyone else had seen it.  This happened in a heavily populated suburb.  One week later, about 10 o'clock PM, I was driving to Blockbuster with my husband and we spotted the same orb near the edge of town.  We followed it until it disappeared into the woods. This happened in the summer of 1992 in Cincinnati, Oh. It has haunted me ever since then. I was 45 at the time and a homemaker. We have witnessed several other strange anomalies in the years since this sighting took place. I know this sounds kooky, but as a child of 6, living in an orphanage in Iowa, I awoke one night to see 3 small alien figures standing next to my bed observing me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

I spotted the first one out the window at about 17:40.  It appeared to be a sphere, that was switching from a silver to dark green color, and once in awhile reddish.  A co-worker then spotted several others.  The main one headed west, then back east.  All of them appeared to hover in place for several seconds, Then went up through the clouds out of sight.  They moved in very straight lines.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Did you see what I saw on 8/8/02?;2002-08-08 22:30:00;15 to 30 seconds;Did you see what I saw on 8/8/02? I am the president of a small corporation that has been in business since 1984. I love to look skyward with the hope that someday I'll see something that I can't explain. Tonight, at ((deleted--60's))years old, I have seen something I can't explain. I was looking into the sky while talking to a friend on the phone. I had seen a number of shooting stars, one of which shot a very long streak from the North to the South. At about 10:30, DST, my eye caught a very brilliant white light looking towards the East. I watched it as it became very large and more brilliant until it was about 15 to 20 times larger and brighter than the brightest star. It remained motionless until it started to dim. It than started to move to the right. As it dimmed but did not disappear, it started to move Southward. Because it was so dim, I could see that it had a round shape. After 10 or 15 seconds , it just disappeared. About 1 hour later I saw the same object, but now it was further NorthEast. It reappeared the same way, became very bright and as it dimmed, it started to move, but this time, it moved towards the North. I am reporting this, because #1, it is the first time I saw something other than a meteor or a satellite, which I've seen many, including the space station which flew over my area at different angles last week...and #2, I would be very interested to learn if anyone else witnessed these objects at the same time I did.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
2 UFOs sighted by Cincinatti Airport;2005-04-01 16:30:00;1 hour;2 UFOs sighted by Cincinatti Airport My friend and I were sitting on a Delta airlines flight to Chicago O'Hare.  The flight was delayed due to traffic in O'Hare, so we looked out the window and found a sphere of light.  It started spinning and emmitted a green light to the ground.  It was soon accompanied by another UFO.  It appeared to have either dissapeared or landed, but I am unsure what happened afterward because we were in the air.  I had a few pictures on my digital camera, but I accidently formatted the camera while transferring them to a computer and can not recover them. ((ADDENDUM BY SAME WITNESS)) 2 UFOs near Cincinatti airport (continued) This is a continuation of the UFO sighting by Cincinatti airport, a report I sent earlier today. I have recovered the pictures on my digital cam and can send them. I also authorize permission for an investigator to contact me. ((END)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the still images, forwarded by the source of the report, and we cannot see anything in the frames that is distinctly suggestive of a genuine UFO.  The photos were taken through the window of an airliner, and the window was covered with droplets of rain, making resolution of objects outside the airliner very poor.  That's the best we can do, given the material available to us.  PD));39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
My wife and I pulled onto shoulder of highway to observing a hovering sphere of light for 2 minutes!  See long description.;2009-05-31 21:39:00;2 minutes;My wife and I pulled onto shoulder of highway to observing a hovering sphere of light for 2 minutes!  See long description. My wife and I (son was sleeping in car seat) were driving on I-275 South(east) towards Milford, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati. As I was driving south I looked up in the sky and a couple of miles ahead of me I saw a glowing orange sphere. I knew it was not a meteorite because I was driving for a good minute before I drove underneath it (and it was still hovering). I kept yelling to my wife in the back with the baby to look up and see it. She could not see it from her angle. I did not want to be the only person who saw this because the veracity of a sole witness is always a challenge. As we drove underneath the object I made the decision to turn on my hazards and hop on the shoulder. I have never pulled over for something like this before, as I have always been able to identify an object, until now. As I was slowing down I kept trying to look up and I almost hit the guardrail as I was pulling over. My wife yelled me to watch out. This did not make her happy since it was her car. As I stopped the car I opened the sunroof and said look! There it was just hovering above us. An orange glowing sphere. The time was 9:39pmEST. It was difficult to determine its altitude and relative size. She thinks it was “too high for a helicopter”, but I think it was only about 5000'-10,000’. It was the size of a (small) dime. Of course you need to know the altitude to determine its actual size. It did not have any other colored lights on it. Just an orange glowing sphere. I should caution in calling it a sphere as we were unable to determine if it was disc/egg shaped due to the glowing light. Sphere matches the best visual description. The light did change in intensity but it was a very small fluctuation and could have been our eyes playing tricks on us. My wife and I were going through a detailed Q&A trying to discern what it was. It was not moving, on any plane (X,Y, or Z). There were no conventional Nav lights or beacons, there was no noise except for the highway, and my wife complaining to get us out of t! here bec ause I woke my son up and they did not share the same enthusiasm and excitement. I did not want to leave because I wanted to wait and see it move. I wanted to see its propulsion. Was it conventional or something unexplainable by our current understanding of technology? This would have filled in a great piece of the puzzle and possibly answered the question. Very frustrated, I decided to heed the wife’s advice and get off the shoulder because we were not in a safe place on the road with traffic whizzing by us.  After safely merging back on I-275, I immediately called my mother's house to tell them to run out front and look to the north a few miles and up (they are on the highest development around and would have a perfect view). My stepfather answered my call and ran to the front to take a look. He saw nothing. We reached exit 59 within a minute (Milford Parkway) and looked to our right (north). You could see a great amount of the horizon and we saw nothing. We arrived home about 5 minutes later, then I made calls to friends and family and now I’m typing this report.  The credibility of the witnesses (my wife and I) are impeccable, as well as the intelligence and scientific backgrounds to make an unbiased observation. We are also well known and respected in the community. In addition I am an amateur astronomer and private pilot (not current) with exceptional knowledge of ALL active military aircraft in service (except of course current black projects). If it warrants an investigation, you have all of my contact information and can Google and contact me. Thank you.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

Red sphere over Cincinnati, OH;2011-05-25 21:15:00;10-12 seconds;Red sphere over Cincinnati, OH I had just taken our dog out for a potty break when I noticed a very unusual object come into view straight up in the southern sky.  The object was reddish orange in color, twice the size of Venus, but about the same brightness as Venus. I instantly called the wife and two kids out to see the object.  It did shimmer a bit, so my wife instantly said it looked similar to a Chinese lantern.  I disagreed the object moved too fast and steady for it to be in any wind pattern.  It took the object approximately 10-12 seconds to move from horizon to horizon, traveling silently from south to north in a straight line. I’ve observed the ISS in the past, and this object was much bigger and seemed a lot lower in the atmosphere.  I’ve also considered that it may have been a meteorite it certainly moved like one, but the red color seemed all wrong.  We did have some severe weather move through the area a couple of hours later, so maybe the atmospheric conditions gave it the red color. I can say that its brightness stayed consistent, so I don’t think it was reflecting sunlight tt appeared to be self luminous.  While I’m sure it was natural in origin, there was just something very odd about its appearance. I just thought I would make the report with the hope that you might be able to tell me what the heck it was. Thanks.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

14 Red/White Spheres Flying Silently over Cincinnati, OH, with video recording.;2014-04-26 21:45:00;15 minutes;14 Red/White Spheres Flying Silently over Cincinnati, OH, with video recording. On the evening of April 26th, 2014 three families were gathered socializing with our kids.  A friend of my 12 year old came to the door and asked that we go outside so she would know she was not crazy.  We then observed what she had been witnessing for the previous 10 minutes or so.  From the horizon north of us heading south/southwest a bright light red/orange/white (changing) would move silently across the sky directly above us and then somewhere between 90-120 degrees across would blink out and disappear.  As one was overhead, the next would come from the horizon.  The 13 year old girl did say that she witnessed two come at once with one blinking out before the other.  The rest of us saw one at a time.  There were 20 of us in the yard the witnessed the last 4.  I was able to video record with my Droid Razor Maxx three of them.  Links to the YouTube posting are provided.  Keep in mind that in the recordings I opted to stay zoomed in at all times other than! the beginning of one that shows one initially coming over the horizon starting spot over our house before I zoomed. Because I was zoomed in you it shakes (remember the flight path was direct and smooth) and you cannot see how quickly they came one at a time across the sky. I hoped by staying zoomed in there might be a moment something of importance might be caught.  My phone was zoomed in at 4x. Just as the last one was gone, I called 911 to report.  They had no knowledge of the event and did not call me back.  I called Wright Patterson Airforce Base, roughly 60 miles north, and they said they had no activity or drills going on that night.  Below is a weather report confirming what I perceived.  We had gentle winds from the west, not the northeast, and clear skys.  I am a professional in the finance industry.  The other adults that observed, along with the children ranging in ages, is a high school teacher and a sales vp for a manufacturing firm.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsYN9vdb0Gw&feature=youtube_gdata_player  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66j4DPRYjCU&feature=youtube_gdata_player  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7s_tEJU0-c&feature=youtube_gdata_player  CLIMATE REPORT NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE WILMINGTON OH 533 AM EDT SUN APR 27 2014   .................................  .THE CINCINNATI OH CLIMATE SUMMARY FOR APRIL 26 2014...

Series of 14 Orange/Red lights moving across the sky and blinking out.  Video recorded.;2014-04-26 21:45:00;20 minutes;Series of 14 Orange/Red lights moving across the sky and blinking out.  Video recorded. Last evening, April 26th, from 21:30-21:55 a group of 20 gathered at a home in Greenhills, Ohio, witnessed 14 orange/red lights move one after another across the sky each to eventually blink out.  It was very unusual making no sound. All of them came from the northeast and moved to the south/southwest (the opposite direction of our current weather pattern.  Additionally, they would have been moving too fast to be floating.  They were more the speed of a fast aircraft on a calm evening. We had plenty of time due to the number that kept coming to record videos and take a few photos.  Additionally, we were able to observe through binoculars.  I’ve spent considerable time through my life star gazing and have never seen anything like this. I did call 911 to report. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter, Below is an updated version of my submission including the weather report verifying the direction of wind I reported.  I've also uploaded two videos to Youtube with the following links.  Let me know if I can enhance the report.  I will try to get two other witnesses to report as well.

Following that was a red blinking sphere.  The blinking was all consistent, it didn't appear to be synchronized between them though.  A plane flew nearby at first but I could  hear the sound from behind the plane but definently not from the other things I saw.  I'm a male I work at a Jet's Pizza and live in Cincinnati, Ohio.
