We were in the parking lot and someone walking behind us tapped my brother-in-law on the shoulder and said what the heck is that and pointed up in the clear night sky.  At first is was a round figure resembling a fire ball many thousands of feet high.  It was stationary for about 3-5 minutes.  There were flames dropping from it.  Finally it moved westward and the flames went out.  Then it had a white smokey glow, and continued to move westward.  About 10 minutest later it appeared to drop at a faster rate from the sky (lasting another 3-5 minutes) until it was out of site.  There was no sound;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Dark object falling rapidly downward from the sky with bright orange flames emanating from it;2008-02-11 02:01:00;4 seconds;Dark object falling rapidly downward from the sky with bright orange flames emanating from it On Monday, February 11, 2008, I was driving home. I was going down Interstate 71 south, and then turned on to Ronald Regan Highway, traveling Westbound. Less than one minute later, at almost exactly 2:01 a.m. I saw an object falling from the sky. It was nearly straight ahead of me and a little to the left, so I would estimate it was in the West-Southwest direction of the sky from where I was located. The object was falling very rapidly so I only saw it for about 3 or 4 seconds. It was falling at an angle from right to left, at about 7 to 8 o’clock (as if looking at a clock handle). There were bright orange flames coming off the object. The object itself was really just a dark spot, but it looked like a dark oval (judging from the flames coming off of the sides essentially) I could only see the flames coming off of it. What really surprised me is how bight and orange the flames were. I have seen meteor showers before, and this looked nothing like a meteorite that I had seen before. The size was very large, and it looked like something was on fire and just falling out of the sky. I did not see if it made it to the horizon, as there were trees to the side of the highway. I sped up in my car trying to make it past the trees on the left to the next clear spot where I could see closer to the horizon, but that took about ten seconds and by that time the object had disappeared.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
12 ovel objects flying east to west orange and red at a slow speed then vanished;2008-10-10 21:30:00;15 minutes;12 ovel objects flying east to west orange and red at a slow speed then vanished UFO sighting in Cincinnati Ohio  On Friday night October 10th my girlfriend and I were coming home after seeing a movie near Hyde Park.  I was driving on Hershel Avenue in Hyde Park when I looked up and saw three orange and red objects that were round in the sky.  I said to my female friend “what is that.”   A few seconds later another one went by and another one followed closely behind.  My female friend said “stop the car I want to get out.”  With that I looked to see if there was a car behind us but nobody was on the road.  She got out and I also got out looking in the general direction of the objects.  There was no sound as they flew by.   They appeared to be 50 or 80 thousand feet in the sky and flying a low speed.  The sky  was clear and there was a moon with no wind.   The objects were moving from the east to the west.  We got back in the car and drove west.  In the distance we could still see the objects forming a circle and following each other in sequence.  They continue to glow a orange/red color and were spinning yet not moving very fast.  As we headed down Erie Avenue towards Hyde Park Square we could still see the objects then they vanished. When I got back to my female friend apartment we got out of the car and went down to the street level.  I looked to the east and saw one more object coming our way.  The object was smaller than the rest but had a red and orange glow.  There was no sound as it flew overhead at a slow speed.  Then a second later after it passed it vanished. We went into her apartment and called Lunken Airport but they didn’t see anything or heard of any reports.  Then we called local news stations, District Two Police and the Cincinnati Enquirer.  All the news agencies said they never heard of anyone else seeing anything. I called the UFO Center to report my sighting and Mr. Peter Davenport answered the phone.  He told me to write down what we saw and we both needed to file a separate report to this agency.  Then Mr. Davenport said see if there is anything on the news about your sighting or if anyone else saw it.  The next day I looked in the papers, and looked at all the local news and there were no reports. In Hyde Park there is an observatory not far from where we first spotted the objects.  I fired an email to the head person there and they respond saying they had guests in the observatory that night but were looking in the direction of the moon.   The gentleman said that there may have been a meteor shower going on at the time or what we saw may have been space junk.  I have seen a meteor shower before, but the meteor past very fast overhead.   I never seen anything that was red and orange that looked like a ball of light flying a low speed.   It was very weird. So far nobody has seen anything to my knowledge or nobody is saying anything.  We live about 60 miles south of Wright Patterson Air Force Base,  10 miles from Greater Cincinnati Airport and 5 miles from Lunken Airport.  We could not hear any sound from these objects so therefore they were not aircraft related.    We both saw them and I must say it was very interesting.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

It was coming north from Kentucky near the CVG airport.  It was bright orange and circular in shape.  It came to a stop and appeared to get larger before it slowly closed down and disappeared.  It did not fly away just just got dimmer until it was gone. Not a plane and not a helicopter.  First UFO I have ever seen in person.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
