Bright flying object - moved so fast backwards out of sight - made no sound;1973-09-12 00:00:00;5 minutes;Bright flying object - moved so fast backwards out of sight - made no sound I was a student at the University of Cincinnati - studying late at night in the dorm towers - looking at the sky - saw a bright light in the sky - it grew brighter - and dimmed - there was no sound - I thought this is not a plane - no flashing lights or tail.  I starred thinking what is this.  I then saw it start to move slowly - one direction - stop and then fly directly back the other direction straight so fast it disappeared.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
2 saucer like objects that moved from place to place then sped towards the sky.;2001-02-23 22:00:00;10 minutes;2 saucer like objects that moved from place to place then sped towards the sky. I was star gazing on my porch one night when I noticed 2 saucer-looking like objects flying in the air.  At first I thought maybe they were airplanes but as I looked closer I knew they were UFO's.  They had lights going around them and they were about 1000 - 1500 feet in the air and they hovered in certain places every now and then.  I watched them for aout 10 minutes before they sped off towards the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
I saw an alian in it's space ship, in the car!;2006-05-12 13:00:00;5 min.;I saw an alian in it's space ship, in the car! I was in my grandpas car, going home from boyscouts, and I saw something strange in the sky.  There were two saucers far in the sky moving back and forth. They would stay still for a few seconds, and then move really fast.  One of them shot into the sky, and disapeared. Then it came shooting back.  I tried to tell my grandpa, but by time he looked, they were gone.  When I got to my house, I found my spy binoculars and looked at the sky.  I waited and I finally saw them again. I looked closely through my binoculars, and saw a small body.  I got a better view of it, and to big, black eyes were starring at me.  It flew away, really fast with the other one.  It was a pretty scary thing for a 9 year old to see! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

If it wasn't 2 halves, then it was 2 saucers.  There were several vehicles surrounding to warn of a wide load.  We were between Cincinnati and I-275.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
UFO sighted on Oct 20, 2007 8:30 pm near downtown Cincinnati;2007-10-20 20:30:00;5 minutes;UFO sighted on Oct 20, 2007 8:30 pm near downtown Cincinnati One the evening of October 20, 2007, I was driving on Kyles Lane in Ft. Wright Kentucky.   My 15 year old daughter, a passenger in the car, started screaming hysterically that she saw a UFO. I laughed it off, thinking it was lights from a nearby ambulance reflecting off of something.  A quarter mile up the road she screamed again, telling me to look to my left, towards downtown Cincinnati.  This is when I caught my first glimpse of the object.  It was obvious that it was not something normal, but I was seeing it between trees.  As I drove a little bit further up the road it was clear as day to me. The object was lit up bright white with vertical tan marks on it that looked like shadows of some sort.  It was somewhat of a disk shape, with another bubble type disk at the top.  Its size was something I couldn't comprehend the possibility of it being able to hover in the air. It was easily the size of 3 city blocks squared.  I continued on Kyles Lane until I came to the bridge over Interstate 75, where I slowed to a near stop. Here we saw the object was within 2 miles of us, bright as could be, hovering just to the west of downtown Cincinnati.  We were both amazed that none of the other cars seemed to notice it.  At this point I was in total disbelief, on the phone with a friend who lived nearby, telling her to stand in her front yard facing Cincinnati and tell me if she saw it.  She saw nothing. Due to traffic I was forced to continue driving. I changed my course by heading south down Dixie Highway towards Covington and the Ohio River. At this point we saw it again, but this time it was much farther away, I'm guessing 30 to 40 miles north of the city. The shape and brightness of it was so distinct there was no confusion as to that being the same object. I sped down the hill on Dixie Highway towards Covington, trying to get near the river, and a better spot. I was hoping to find someplace to park with a clear view. I lost sight of it again while going down the hill, but once at the bottom, going east to! wards Fi fth Street we saw it for the final time. I was now near the river again, only this time it was east of Cincinnati, about 20 miles from the first sighting. Being a non-believer, I have gone over every possible scenario in my head, trying to convince myself I didn't see what I saw. There is also the fact that my daughter saw it, first I might add, and was completely shaken up to the point of hysterical crying and shaking that I could not console her in the least. I considered taking her to the hospital to be sedated, she was that upset. I also realized that I was shaking while trying to tell the story to a friend where my daughter was spending the night. I spent the rest of the night and the next morning trying to decide whether I was going to tell anyone. I consider anonymously calling the police station and saying Look, I don't think I'm crazy, but have you had any reports of a strange bright object seen around the city in the sky? I watched every news report for several days and scoured the newspapers, but I have seen no mention of anything that could even remotely be what we saw. There was a blimp in town the next day for a football game, but it was nowhere near the right shape and at least 10 times too small. So help me here, please. Are both my daughter and I certifiable insane or did someone else see this also?;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
I, and a friend, and her date were outside and noticed a strange orange light in the sky. At first glance we thought it was a star. But;2012-07-01 00:00:00;15 to 20 minutes;I, and a friend, and her date were outside and noticed a strange orange light in the sky. At first glance we thought it was a star. But the color was not the same and it looked to be in line next to Venus.  Then it seamed to be moving closer to us. From southwest direction to North East direction downward towards us. As it came closer to us one orange light, became 2 lights, and it made no sound.  We could see it was just above the tree line and it stopped and hovered for about 5 minutes and again made no sound. Then the lights went out.  And when it did we saw a greenish sort of glow and it then simply moved very slowly drifted East, above my home. We all knew this was a ufo and was seriously in a state of shock for all of us... Then it moved back into a South East direction.  As it moved, it was as if it had a device that made it just disappear from the outside inward.  Like an invisible what some call a cloaking device.  this whole event took about 15 to 20 minutes as far as I know. The object pattern seamed move in a square pattern.  Nothing like what at least we know of, that could move like this.  The image is so imprinted in my mind where I had to draw it as to not to forget what I saw. I just keep thinking that I cannot believe I would of ever seen anything like this in my entire life. I,  my friend , and her date are still in shock, and it was so close to us. I felt as tho we were being observed. At that point I went straight into the house.  I am now petrified to even look up at the stars and feel the same. My friend feels the same.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

The next day I saw on Facebook a friend who lives about 20 miles north posted that her and her husband saw a similar object about 10-15 minutes prior to us.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
