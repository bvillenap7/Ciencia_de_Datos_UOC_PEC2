As I was heading back inside to go to bed, I heard a plane overhead, and as usual for me, I looked up.  I watched the plane for a few seconds, then noticed something moving within my view.  I watched what I thought was a shooting star.  It was moving perpendicular to the direction the plane was moving (the plane was moving S/SW toward the Northern Kentucky / Greater Cincinnati Airport the shooting star was moving East).  Then when the plane was just about out of my line of sight, the object burst into a huge flash of light, then dimmed about 10 seconds later.  by this time I knew it wasn't a shooting star because it was moving incredibly slow.  When the flash died down, instead of fading out completely, it made a 90 degree turn, to the same direction the plane was headed.  For the next 8 or so minutes it remained the size of a regular (stationary) star in the sky, then it slowly faded away. I know this sounds very strange, and I still have a hard time believing it myself.  I got less than 2 hours of sleep that night because I was up thinking about what I saw.   The next day at work, I called two local radio stations to find out if anything unusual in the sky had been reported the night before.  Both said that there hadn't. Then I called a local tv news station and asked the same question.  they said no too.  (i have witnesses to these calls). I hope that this story is believed by who ever reads it, because it is true.

Several bright flashes in Cincinnati.;2017-08-12 22:00:00;5-10 minute;several bright flashes in Cincinnati On Saturday night, 08/12/17, my wife and I were standing outside of our home watching for the meteor shower.  We sadly did not see any meteors, but witnessed something else.   I caught a really bright white flash out of the corner of my eye first and directed my attention towards it.  It more or less blinked in and out of view several times. I  pointed it out to my wife whom was standing right next to me.  She didn't see it at first but finally saw it.  That was the first UFO that really had me scratching my head.  Mind you it was a beautiful night out very little cloud cover and stars all over.  After that initial sighting we observed probably 3 or 4 more in a span of about 5-10 minutes.  I initially thought it possibly have been a satellite or something.  They all just kinda flashed and disappeared and flashed again.  I was astounded as was my wife.   I really was hoping to find more reports of this because it was such a nice night and figured there would have been more people outside that night that may have seen them.  I thought they possibly could have been meteors, but, I have never seen a meteor act that way, usually they are more like a shooting star to the best of my knowledge. All in all it was very bizarre.  I just couldn't wrap my head around it and neither could she.   Thanks for having this site.  I just had to toss this out there and see if anything similar had been seen.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
