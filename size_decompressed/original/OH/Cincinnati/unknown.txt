Travel time was way shorter than it should have been (missing time?);1994-06-20 09:00:00;6 hours;Travel time was way shorter than it should have been (missing time?) I keep recollecting this incident so decided to submit a report.  This happened sometime in the summer/very early fall between 1993 and 1995, in the days before GPS and automated navigation, and before we had kids.  My wife and I decided to drive from North Alabama to Western New York State to visit her parents.  Since our route was taking us nearby Ft. Thomas, KY, where her aunt lived at the time, we agreed we would stop there for the night and take her aunt with us to New York State. In those days, I prided myself on my map-based navigational skills and ability to predict our arrival time to within 15 minutes, even driving hundreds of miles.  I was never off by more than a couple minutes, ever.  The first part of the trip to Ft. Thomas was uneventful, and we arrived within my predicted timeframe.  The second part of the trip from Ft. Thomas to our destination in western NYS, I predicted to be around 530 miles with a travel time of 7hrs 45 min to 8 hrs in duration (which gives an average interstate speed of about 66 mph, including stops).  All went well and we had a great trip.  I seem to recall that the last leg of the journey (maybe 50-100 miles) seemed a bit off from where I expected to be, like I took the wrong exit, but we easily knew where we were, and we made it to the in-laws as expected. When we arrived, the in-laws seemed surprised.  They were not expecting us so soon, even though I had given them the expected arrival time the day before, and we had spoken to them when we left, so they would know when we started.  The problem was, we arrived over 2 hours earlier than predicted, based on mileage and travel time from KY to western NYS. My wife, her aunt, and I were totally confused about how we got there so fast.  We checked the distances, and reran the calculations several times, each time showing the original, predicted 8 hour travel time and predicted arrival time (taking time zones into account).  I don’t remember if we ever checked the odometer (it seems that we would have), nor what the mileage was.  Getting there in 6 hours would have had us averaging over 88 mph.  I never drive that fast, and couldn’t through the city areas, and would have surely remembered doing so.   After a very short while we shrugged it off and went about our business.  However, in the weeks and years after, we talked about it off and on, and agree we all felt very weirded out.  It was a memorable experience. Other than driving through Cincinnati near the start and feeling like we took the wrong exit and road at the end, I don’t have any particular memories of the trip, of how we actually got from Ft. Thomas to our destination, where/when we got gas or made stops, or if we ate along the way.  Everything is a blur to each of us.  However, I do feel like at some point, I asked my passengers do you believe in them now.”  But it is a fuzzy memory, and I don’t know if I asked it, or if I somehow inserted that into my memory of that day.  What I do know is that we made impossible time on that trip, corroborated by outside witnesses, and we three travelers have no idea how we did it.  And I have seen plenty of strange things and had a number of odd experiences in my life, a number of which I have reported to this site.

Red flashing lights on loud large hovering thing which stayed in the sky for over an hour;2001-12-09 02:00:00;1 hour 15 min;Red flashing lights on loud large hovering thing which stayed in the sky for over an hour At approximately 2:00 AM we heard what sounded like some sort of aircraft that was extremely loud with a rumbling sort of sound.  I looked outside and saw something in the sky with red flashing lights.  It wasn't really moving.  Mostly, it was staying in one place(almost hovering).  We went outsideoccasionally this thing would move a little(one direction or the other).  It was dark.  It was hard to make out the actual shape this thing was.  The lights weren't really in a uniform pattern.  The lights were flashing in a zig-zaggy formation.  Neighbors came out because they also heard the LOUD rumbling noise.  We talked about the possibility of it being a helicopter.  However, it did not sound or look like a helicopter.  And it stayed around, for at least, over an hour.  A couple of cars had also pulled over down the street.  They were also looking at this thing.  In checking with the Police, no helicopters were dispatched at that time.  We have no idea what it was!  We didn't see it go away because we came in the house due to being spooked.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

Red lighted object moving over Cincinnati;2009-01-01 02:00:00;3 min;Red lighted object moving over Cincinnati While outside on my front porch I saw a bright red object at about 2 am this morning.  I watched it for about 1min before calling my wife , son and daughter to come and take a look.  There was no sound at all and the red light was not flashing nor was there a white or green light like there is on an airplane.  As it moved from north west to south east the bright red light did not change in brightness.  Then it appeared to have stopped, then the bright red light faded out and vanished. It looked like it changed directions and went straight away from us.  From the time that it looked like it had stoped and changed directions was about 1 to 2 seconds then it was gone. If i were to have blinked my eyes i would not have notice it stopping and changing directions. I have read some other reports of people in cincinnati ohio seeing the same thing back in october of this year and we just saw the same thing.  Just wanted to let you know.  We are located on the east side of cincinnati in Anderson township. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

On 10/13/10, while driving, I saw an unusual nonblinking, stationary light over Cincinnati.;2010-10-13 20:00:00;5 minutes;On 10/13/10, while driving, I saw an unusual nonblinking, stationary light over Cincinnati. On Wednesday, October 13, 2010, after 8p.m. in the sky over Cincinnati, Ohio, there was a single white steady light.  It did not seem to move, but I was driving at the time and could not keep my eyes on the object.  It was quite bigger than any visible stars or planets, but a very small fraction of the size of the moon.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Round bright light over Cincinnati.;2015-10-18 18:00:00;20 seconds;Round bright light over Cincinnati My friend and I were passengers in the back seat of a car driving down I-71 south near the Edwards Rd exit.  While talking a clearly round, bright white light like a star or planet appeared in the east sky.  I pointed and said what was that?  We assumed it was the aforementioned but it began to move upward in the sky like a rocket and then disappeared.  Then there was a cloud trail across the sky like a jet had flown by.  There was no noise like a jet had flown overhead.   Also this was a matter of seconds if this was a jet it had to be new technology we were witnessing.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

2 white lights, 1 possibly exploded?;2018-02-20 20:30:00;1 minute;2 white lights, 1 possibly exploded? I believe it was between 20:00 and 21:00 on Tuesday, 2-19-18.  I was taking the trash out.  We are in a densely populated area, so lots of lights.  It was a clear night but generally not a lot of stars visible where we are.  I was staring up in a southern direction, around the area of Orion’s Belt. I noticed a star to the immediate right of Orion's Belt that was twinkling more than the others.  It was white, same as any other star or light you would normally see at night.  As I watched, it started to actually flicker like a dying light bulb.  Very rapidly and erratically on and off.  There didn’t seem to be any sort of pattern to the flickering.  This went on for maybe 15 to 20 seconds. There was then a quick brighter burst of white light, then it flickered out completely.  Didn’t see it again.  About 1 to 2 seconds later, looking to the right of the first light, I saw another small white light flicker on out of nowhere.  Wasn’t as bright as the first light and that was followed almost instantly by an orange burst of smaller lights.   Very faint but I would say it looked like an explosion.  There were multiple, smaller orange lights emanating from the second light.  Like something hit it and orange pieces flew off of it.  They moved out very quickly in a seashell shape, with the small side coming from the second white light – the orange pieces were moving back towards the spot of the first light.  The second flash that was followed by the orange burst was visible for maybe a total of 3-4 seconds? I was looking up in the sky for a few minutes but once I notice the first light flickering, the entire event took 20-30 seconds? I couldn’t tell any shapes other than they looked like any other star in the sky.  The first white light was same size, color, shape.  The second white light was smaller and fainter as were the orange pieces. Totally guessing on distance here.  I’m 6’2”.  If I were to hold a ruler up, I’d guess the first light was 5 inches to the right from the Orion’s Belt.  The second light was another 4 to 5 inches from the first light.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
