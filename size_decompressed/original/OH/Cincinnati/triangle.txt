Massive triangle hoovering over city block.;1989-09-01 20:00:00;unknown;Massive triangle hoovering over city block My mother and I returned home one evening to find a huge triangle hoovering over our block.  The triangle had lights all around the edges, not just the three corners.  The lights were of red, green, and blue. After only a few minutes of looking at the object my mom was afraid and took me inside.  There were many witnesses because people were stainding outside of their houses and cars were even stopped in the street. I am a little stunned that there is nothing at all documented about this case due to the number of witnesses and the huge size of the craft.  It was so massive I'm sure it could have been seen for miles. I have never seen anything writting about it.  I've search for years to find something but have been coming up with nothing. An interesting note is that there was an army storage base not even five minutes away.  I wish I was older so I could have stayed out and looked at the thing instead of my mom forcing me inside.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

UFO at Cincinnati Reds stadium;2002-07-06 21:15:00;3-5 seconds;UFO at Cincinnati Reds stadium It was at the Reds stadium during a game. I was sitting all the way at the top and was behind the homeplate. I look over to the new stadium being built and see 3 lights in a triangular pattern. I see it first quickly and then see it clearly as it appeared again. It then moved down past the new stadium and at that point I tell my brother what I saw. It was 3 green lights in a triangular pattern and I could not see the shape of the craft. It moved toward the ground and I did not see it go back up.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

Triangular UFO seen in daylight, with U.S. jet chasing;2010-07-15 14:00:00;5 Minutes;Triangular UFO seen in daylight, with U.S. jet chasing My husband and I were traveling to my parents' house one afternoon when I saw this very large, triangular shaped aircraft traveling above us. It wasn't going very fast, and it was close enough to the earth to see detail. It reminded me of an arrowhead in shape it had three points, a light orange light on each point, and the back end of the craft bowed inward between the two end points.  I rolled down my window but could not detect a noise.  The craft had no noticeable markings and seemed to be made of metal, which was a medium gray. It was not shiny the outside of the craft had a dull finish to it. Both my husband and I watched it as it continued straight, then made a ninety-degree sudden turn to the left. It suddenly started flying off toward the distance at a much faster pace than it had been going, and it was soon out of sight. My husband and I were talking about what we'd seen when a U.S. Plane that looked like a jet came from the direction that the other aircraft had come from. This plane was loud, fast, and a dark gray to black in color. Where the UFO had made a ninety-degree turn, the new plane turned as well, although it didn't turn as sharply or as quickly as the other craft had. It followed the trail that the other aircraft had made, zooming out of sight in the same direction. I wouldn't be surprised if someone else saw this craft in action that day. It was about two in the afternoon in the middle of summer, and the route the air crafts took was along the same route of a popular road in our hometown. This craft was very large and like nothing I had ever seen before, so it was bound to gather attention. I did not hear anything about this craft from anyone else whether through word-of-mouth or media afterwards, although I did look out for more information. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Triangular craft with 2 big bright red lights.;2015-08-15 22:00:00;2 minutes;Triangular craft with 2 big bright red lights. My cousins and I were on our way home from vacation. at first I thought I was just hallucinating because I saw a red like hovering about 100 feet above the cars.   When it was doing that we only saw 1 red light but then it swept down literally only 1 foot above the cars about 100 feet from my car and tilted that's when I noted 2 red lights about the size of stop lights but I couldn't imagine the size because the lights were distant.   It swept over the cars tilted to dodge trees and when we passed there was nothing there. If something flew into those trees they would crash and there was nothing there it was gone.   Then our radio that was turned off turned up loud as we passed and was static, then turned off. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Silent Transparent Triangular craft with bright white orb in the center!;2017-08-24 06:33:00;30 seconds;Silent Transparent Triangular craft with bright white orb in the center! I know it seems difficult to believe, but I know what I saw and I have 20/15 vision perfectly health adult male, no substance use not even alcohol. What I saw was a completely silent translucent triangular craft with bright white orb of light in center, flying from north to south. It was broad daylight and it was flying quite low, i'd estimate about only several thousands feet above ground. It was truly amazing, I wish i knew what this was and what civilization this originates from or what type of military experimental craft this is! ((NUFORC Note:  Date was flawed.  We do not know the year of the alleged event.  Witness elects to remain anonmyous provides no contact information.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Triangular craft, dim lights, traveling in straight line, low altitude, high velocity, silent - Cincinnati OH;2019-01-05 15:20:00;10 seconds;Triangular craft, dim lights, traveling in straight line, low altitude, high velocity, silent - Cincinnati OH -Background: I have no pertinent professional background, but have an interest in astronomy and bird watching, so I spend a lot of time on my back deck observing the cosmos with a telescope and watching birds with a spotting scope.  I live a few miles north of CVG intl. airport with my deck facing west, so I also use my spotting scope to track the occasional plane as they approach along a southern trajectory.  -Moment of sighting + description of craft: I was in my back yard (no scope) staring roughly WSW trying to get a good view of the Aquarius constellation for several minutes when I noticed the object moving at what appeared to be a fairly low altitude, though I could not discern with certainty, along a NNW to SSE trajectory at an extremely high velocity.  The object virtually flew right over my head (seemed to be less than 1/4 mile to the west), yet it was 100% silent.  It is difficult to estimate its size, as I could only make out the lights and not the body of the craft itself.  The lights numbered between 6 and 10 and were arranged in a triangle.  They were very dim, such that if I hadn't already been looking in that direction with my pupils adjusted to view the dim starlight I certainly wouldn't have seen it.  The lights didn't blink or change at all, and also lacked any discernable hues, appearing to be a dim grey shade.  It traveled in a straight line and was out of sight in a matter of 10 seconds or less, seemingly covering several miles in that brief window of time.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Large V/triangle-shaped craft that moved silently.  Disappeared at incredible rate of speed.;2019-05-08 21:15:00;15 seconds;Large V/triangle shaped craft that moved silently. Disappeared at incredible rate of speed. I was driving home when something very large in the eye caught my eye. I was stopped at a light near my home and only got 15-20 secs of view. The craft was very large v/triangle shape. 9-10 lights lining the V pattern. I heard no sound from the craft. The craft was heading NE at an estimated 15-20k feet. Dark in color either black or dark gray. It made 2 movements. It seemed to descend rapidly and then abruptly shot out of sight along the same path it was traveling. I am not aware of any other witnesses to this phenomenon.  Life changing.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Bright Orange Light from large Black Triangular Vehicle constant altitude, course and speed, no noise.;2019-07-14 21:25:00;5 minutes;Bright Orange Light from large Black Triangular Vehicle constant altitude, course and speed, no noise. On the evening of July 14, 2019, approximately 9:25 PM EDT,  I was driving home from dinner along Cleves Warsaw Rd, travelling west, glancing out the window to observe the conjunction of the moon with the planet Jupiter occurring that evening in the southwest sky, when I noticed a bright orange light which appeared to be moving slowly from west to east.  What I immediately notices is that this object did not have conventional aircraft navigation lights, tail beacon, or belly strobe light as you would expect to see on a conventional aircraft.  Nor am I aware of any aircraft having an orange headlamp, and having been a student pilot earlier in life, this intrigued me.  I was really trying to see what this object was. 	I continued to drive, until I was able to reach a parking lot, where I pulled in facing south, and I watched the object, travelling at a constant speed, which was relatively slow, my guess would be 30-40 knots, on a steady course towards the east, in the direction of downtown Cincinnati, OH.  The object passed slightly south of where I was parked, about 80 degrees off of vertical at my position, at an approximate altitude, my guess, of 1500 feet Above Ground Level. 	As the object flew past me, to the east, the orange light flickered out, it didn’t just shut off.  All through its flight, at every angle, the luminosity of the light had been constant.  Once the bright light was gone, I could clearly see a very large black triangular vehicle (perhaps the size equivalent of a Lear jet) continuing its flight to the east, and was able to watch it until it faded into the distance and into the darkening sky (the sun had just set, but there was still quite good light throughout this event). 	This object made no sound at all.  Its course west to eastward took it perpendicularly through the final approach glideslopes of three major runways of the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky airport.  There was no encounter with an aircraft as it moved through perpendicular to all three runway 18 glideslopes which run north to south. 	I do not know what this was, but a few days later at dinner at a friend’s home, I was told that their son and his friend also saw the same object that same night about the same time from a place that was about a mile east of where I was parked that evening, and that he had called his parents for them to go out and look at it, and his parents missed it.  At dinner that evening on July 18, there was speculation about a drone, sunlight reflecting off an aircraft, and yet to me, that doesn’t explain the lack of engine noise.  I’m wondering if anyone else saw this, and they would know what it was.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
