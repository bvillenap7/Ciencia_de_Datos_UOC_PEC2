Watched diamond shaped object  which was motionless except for earths rotation for about one hour.;1972-08-10 16:00:00;1 hour;Watched diamond shaped object  which was motionless except for earths rotation for about one hour. It was a warm clear day with a haze on the horizon.  The kids were playing in the front yard and I had sat down on the front porch step to watch them.  It was 16:00 hours and clear.  I noticed a bright diamond shaped object at about 2:00 oclock angle in the western sky.  I was facing west. I got out my Mimia 35 MM camera and tripod.  I put on a doubler and my 200 MM telephoto lens.  I took 7 photos of the object which had no movement other than the rotation of the earth taking it downward out of the cameras field of view. It finally dissappeared in the haze near the horizon.  My house was in a deep valley, so the sun was below the top of the  hill and the object,to the West.  I still had the 35MM slides. I made an elargement of one of the slides by projecting it about 40 feet onto a ground glass plate and photographing it from the back.  The original images are so small it is hard to see any detail.  This thing was out in space, beyond the atmosphere, I think. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Stationary , diamond shaped object , only visable thing in the sky between 4 and 5 pm;1972-08-25 17:00:00;45 minutes;Stationary , diamond shaped object , only visable thing in the sky between 4 and 5 pm I was on the front porch watching the kids play in the front yard. It was a beautiful, clear, late afternoon, summer day.  I noticed this bright object in the sky, being several hours before sunset, I thought it strange for a star to be visable. I got out my 35 MM Mamia camera, put on my 205 MM telephoto lens with a 2x doubler. I set it up on my tripod and took 6 or 7 color slides of the object.  The only movement was the rotation of the earth caused it to move down out of the view finder. I was facing due west looking up at about a 45 degree angle. The sun was below and left of the object, below the ridge west of me.  I lived down in a valley with a ridge to my west with an elevation of 850 feet above sea level.  It appeared to me the object was beyond the atmosphere and finally disappeared in the summer haze on the horizon.  I made a super large inlargement by projecting the image 50 feet across the basement onto a ground glass plate and photograghing it from behind the plate. I will send a print.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
4 lights shot across the sky - low - then hovered just above treeline - yellow/orange and one by one they dimmed &got bright &floated;2009-11-07 00:00:00;3 minutes;4 lights shot across the sky - low - then hovered just above treeline - yellow/orange and one by one they dimmed & got bright & floated my son saw 4 lights zip across the sky - low then suddenly stopped and hovered near the horizon - they looked yellow to me but my 2 sons thought more orangish - then they slkowly floated towards the horizon and intermittently came on and off - individually - not all together - then one broke off and floated toward the ground - ( fell behind the treeline ) then one 'arced ' off and you could see a slight trail as it kind of half circled then went down also - then the others went sideways - then down - then they were gone . My son was so grateful we all ran out or we never would have seen them - there were 5 of us and it was bizarre!!;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Small diamond craft with two white lights on the sides and a red light on the front in the shape of a triangle;2011-07-07 00:50:00;1 min;Small diamond craft with two white lights on the sides and a red light on the front in the shape of a triangle I took my dog outside before bed and we were both startled by a loud deep droning sound that lasted a second.   I looked up and saw a circular diamond shaped craft but could not make out the type.   The craft was moving at a much lower altitude and speed than the usual jet that flies above my house.  It was flying west at a consistent speed and had a feint jet like noise.   The craft was slightly larger than a helicopter but did not have the distinct noise of a helicopter.   The craft had two white lights on the sides and a red light on the front in the direction it was moving. The lights were in the shape of a triangle and very visible.  All three lights were pulsing on and off every several seconds consistently.   The craft also had orange dim cones of light on the body facing the front and the rear.  These cones shimmered like it was heated exhaust from a jet engine.   It was too dark to get a more detailed view and the craft was lost in the tree line after a few seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  We spoke with him via telephone, in order to confirm the time and date of the sighting, and he sounded sober-minded to us.
