Spectrum colored lights move across the sky and from them emerges a white light.;1992-10-15 22:00:00;Few seconds;Spectrum colored lights move across the sky and from them emerges a white light. In October of 1993 I was walking from the Library Building towards Rhine Hall on the campus of Cincinnati Bible College and as I looked up and towards my left (which meant I was looking towards the Ohio River and the Northern KY area)  I saw a UFO.   I saw what appeared to be the seven colors of the spectrum emerge from nowhere and briefly move across the sky southwestward in a pattern that I can only liken to a chalkboard line maker moving across a chalkboard.  If you were in grade school in the 1970’s and 1980’s as I was you may remember your teacher placing chalk in several wire holders attached to a piece of wood she would use to make lines on a chalkboard.  Imagine the colors of the spectrum being drawn on a chalkboard and that is basically what I saw. The colored lines emerged from nowhere and briefly moved across the sky and then abruptly stopped.   From them shot a bright white light that moved across the sky in a southwestwardly direction.  The whole sighting took a couple of seconds at the most.

I'm not claiming this to necessarily be a UFO sighting, but I heard similar cases were reported on Art Bell's program last night and they were encouraging people to report what they saw.  At 19:05, I was walking facing eastward when I saw three bright lights.  They appeared to be decreasing altitude at first then changed and continued to the south.  The objects were flaking off small bits of light.  I continued to watch them until they disappeared to the south.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

Bright, blinking star -like objects moving from the western horizon toward the east were observed.;2007-09-02 21:00:00;2 to 4 minutes;Bright, blinking star -like objects moving from the western horizon toward the east were observed. I would like to report an unusual sighting witnessed by 8 adults on Sunday night September 2, 2007 in Delhi (a western township of Cincinnati, Ohio). It was 9 p.m. and we were sitting on our deck. I noticed 2 blinking, bright star-light objects moving from the western horizon in a straight line toward the east. They were followed by 4 to 6 more similar objects. Then numerous blinking lights appeared traveling or following the lead lights. At one point they appeared to be zigzagging still traveling west to east. The blinking was at about two blinks per second. After they passed 45 degrees overhead they grouped together. Then another group appeared in the western horizon traveling west to east. Meanwhile the first group paused till the second group approached and then they continued on to the west and out of our sight. We estimate from 80 to 100 of the blinking white lights. The event lasted 2 to 4 minutes. We are professional, respected adults who live and work in our community. I am a grade school teacher. I have taught 5th grade astronomy. I am familiar with the night sky. This was very unusual. I would appreciate some information or feedback concerning the event. Thank you.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

One star-shaped object. I thought it was Venus, being the brightest of the night stars. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS??  PD));2009-10-20 20:30:00;5-10 seconds;One star-shaped object. I thought it was Venus, being the brightest of the night stars.  But then it glowed bright, and moved upward, relative to planes and debris/falling stars I've seen before in my life.  It moved higher, slowly (one mississippi....), directly upward, and by the slow count of three it faded, as a light, into dissapearance. I'm a sinic so I called my mom, who is not.  As I was leaving a message to tell her I saw this I saw what looked like a shooting star. I saw the news about the potential meteor shower in the AM, but this was different, to say the least. Thanks.

cinti,ohio      23:00   light in back yard;2010-01-09 22:00:00;not sure;cinti,ohio      23:00   light in back yard my son and I live on two too three acres.we have lived here for all most two years.this sighting began the second week of july 2008. the first time we saw the light was around 23:00 hours. our back yard is nothing but trees, if you walk south about 6 hundred feet you will come to a drop off that is about 4 hundred feet at a 15 dregee.  the light came from there. my son was the first to see it what is that he said. I look in the direction where he pointed just then a second later it was gone.  i have seen lights in the sky and one night i had my lazer pointer an sent a messeage in morse code,this light answer back,then it was gone. the messeage said come on down,their answer was not now,maybe later. since then we have been seeing these light in the sky. on 01/9/2010 at 21:hours we pulled into our drive way I had my high beams on thats when I saw foot prints  going from the garage doors that face the woods all the way back to the end of the woof and just stopped at the window. now I have a garage that will hold six large cars. This garage is at least 60 feet wide and as long. things have been coming to the back porch knocking on the back door,we also have come home and found things moved around in the house. my dog goes crazy barking at something in the backs woods. I have went out in the back yard to get him to stop barking and myself heard something moving around. one night I came home around 2am,parked the car,locked the door and began to walk up the long driveway when I hear something say hi to me. being very dark I walked faster up the driveway and into my house. It was at least 80 degrfees out side ,but i sat there shaking.  this is a non stop going thing,maybe I should not have told then to come;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Saw unknown persistent light in the sky and then a gray object that arced away when the light stopped.;2010-07-03 21:35:00;5 minutes;Saw unknown persistent light in the sky and then a gray object that arced away when the light stopped. I was out birding Saturday evening at Valley View Preserve.  It was about 935pm.  There were scattered fireworks going off to the south and the northeast but I think it was still a little too light out for people to start setting things off in earnest.  The sky was clear or had a few clouds.  I was looking at and scanning the tree line with binoculars for perched owls when I saw this persistent orange-yellow light in the sky south or southwest hovering in the same spot at maybe 45-50 degrees above the horizon and not flickering.  The light was maybe 2 or 3 times larger than Venus in the sky and certainly way smaller than the moon.  I had no idea what it was but eventually figured it was either a) some kind of firework b) the back of a distant plane/jet or maybe c)the launch of some kind of rocket or something since the last weird thing I saw in the sky, that was kind of similar to this event, was part of an NSA Atlas rocket launch. After a few minutes of shining in exactly the same spot in the sky, the light stopped and I saw this gray, blurry object slowly arc a very short distance east from where the light had been until it faded away or I just lost track of it in the increasing darkness.  The gray object, which I figured was the emitter of the light, was roughly the same size as the light or maybe slightly smaller and possibly top-like in shape.  I watched the whole sequence with and without binoculars but don't recall the binoculars giving me a much better view of the event except that they more clearly revealed a non-flickering light.  The light was shining for a few minutes and I saw the gray object for probably less than 30 seconds. I don't know what it actually was but still think it could have been one of the things I thought it might be.  If it was a firework, I've never seen anything exactly like it before.  The light looked sort of like a Roman candle if there was just one flare, no smoke trail and the flare stayed in one spot in the sky instead of moving in an arc.  If it was a plane, there should have been blinking lights on the object after the light, it should have moved in a more direct way and I should have heard some sort of sound.  I don't recall hearing any sounds that I could attribute to the light/object.  And if it was some sort of rocket, it didn't seem to leave Earth's atmosphere and was a little different than what I saw before. I had actually completely forgotten about this until Peter Davenport appeared on Coast to Coast AM and am submitting this report per his request.  And I'm not looking at any of the other reports until I submit mine.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Slow, low-flying lights making vast circles in the night sky (probably an odd airplane)  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  PD));2011-05-24 01:15:00;30 minutes (and counting);Slow, low-flying lights making vast circles in the night sky (probably an odd airplane) Very likely just an airplane, but certainly an odd one if it was.  I just thought I would report it in case any other reports came in from the area.   I was driving home and noticed what appeared to be an airplane two lights apparently on the ends of the wings, but they were not blinking like an airplane.  In addition, it was traveling both very low and very slowly.  It was making vast, sweeping circles of the night sky, the two white lights visible from all angles as it did.   This continued the entire time I was driving home and long enough for me to find my camera and take several pictures.   It was still circling when I came inside (more than 30 minutes later).  Like I said, this is very unlikely to be anything more than an odd plane (there is a small airport - Lunken - just a few miles away) but it was unlike anything I've seen before, mostly because it was traveling so slowly and in circles (did not appear to be centered near the airport).;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

I wasn't sure if I should walk down to get a further look because it seemed so far away.  Basically I watched it pulsate and gleam while it moved back and fourth from behind a tree at the end of the street. The light also would glow very brightly, go back into itself, then glow brightly again. Not to positive on what it could have been, or even how far away it was.  It disappeared after about two minutes, so I disregarded it as a possible helicopter or airplane. The light suddenly came back slightly to the right of where it was moving before.  It then became very bright and simply vanished no more than a second later.  Not in a shooting off type of vanishing, just simply went away. Nothing to my knowledge could make that light, and move in the way that it did. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I was unloading things from my car and bringing them into my house when I saw two amber/orange lights moving slowly in the sky at the exact same speed. I heard no noise and noticed that the two orbs were keeping the same distance apart from each other and moving in the same south eastern direction across the sky.  I managed to get my phone out in time to capture the tail end of the two objects and showed my wife.  The quality of the video doesn't do it justice, but it serves to prove what I saw.  I have found several other videos on YouTube of the same thing!  What are they?  I know they weren't airplanes.  I am familiar with what an airplane looks like at night (blinking lights, often white with smaller blue or red lights on the wings).  These were not planes.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

As;2016-03-20 11:30:00;10 minutes;On Sunday, March 20th, 2016, at approximately 11:20 am, I was leaving my house to take my usual exercise walk around the neighborhood.  As I hit the sidewalk and began walking West, I looked up at the sky and saw several distinct points of light - which looked much like stars against the clear blue sky background.  These points of light formed a large square.  I viewed this with both the naked eye, and with my polarized sunglasses.   I quickly ran into the house to retrieve my binoculars, but by the time I returned - a minute or so later - nothing was there to be seen.  I put away the binoculars and began my walk.  A short distance down the street, I saw a single, bright point of light in the same area of the sky.  This remained stationary until approximately 11:30 am, and I have not seen anything else as of the time of this report.  I am mainly reporting this because I really hope to hear that someone else around the Cincinnati Tri-State witnessed the event.

I was alone in the car when I noticed a very bright, low hovering light in the western sky toward the downtown Cincinnati direction.  It was way too low on the horizon to be a star or planet.   I pulled over in the car and parked where I could have nearby points of reference to see if this object was moving at all. It was not.  There were no flashing lights, just a brilliantly bright slightly flickering light.   When viewed through a very low power set of bird watching binocs it took on a 3 pointed shine shape.
