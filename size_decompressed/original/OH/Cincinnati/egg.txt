It looked very small and had an odd contrail. Clear sky. It was a perfectly clear day.  I saw it through the windshield, it look very odd to be so high above the plane that had just passed.  I watched cross the horizon in about 30 secs from East to West in a straight line.  It was metallic and it had a trail that disappeared very quickly, but was visible constantly.  When I enlarge the photos that I took with my digital camera(bought 2 days prior was in my pocket) the tail looks very large, the ufo is so small you can barely see it. A couple days later I noticed weird wavy or ruffled clouds covered the entire sky.  I saw the clouds were like that two seperate times.  I look forward to clear days now.  I know an airplane when I see one, there is a nearby airport.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

This occured at 10:30Pm at I275 and Hwy 128. The Ufo was emitted a red light from the bottom about every 2 seconds. No way was this a plane or a blimp. It only took about 30 seconds to get above my car so i could not see it anymore. I then proceeded to stop my car. when i did the ufo was gone.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

It was during the WEBN Cincinatti Firework show of 2010 over the OHIO river between Cincinatti and Covington, Ky.  It was acutally during the grand finally 15 seconds before the end of the show before they say OPEN FIRE. At that point the fireworks look like a battlefield of muskets going off nothing but grey clouds of smoke. I recorded the show on my dvr.   At about 9:21-25p.m. easter time a bright white light shows up on the right side of the screen and moves all the way to the left side while these fireworks are going on.  When we put it in slow motion it looked like we could make out the shape of the object which looked like more of an egg shape on the left side compared to the saucer looking shape when it first came into view.  It moved too fast to be an airplane and I can say that with confidence because Airplanes are not supposed to fly that close to the bridge and also as soon as the show is over you can see an airplane fly through the back with a c! onstant flashing light compared to the constant brightness of the ufo. I would say if we had a 1080 p tv we could get a better view due to the larger pixels of our tv;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
