I don't exactly remember everything because I was only six years old.  I remember getting out of our car and standing in our apartment complex with my parents.  My dad just started screaming at my mom to get the camera and I didn't understand why.  Then he pointed in the sky.  There was an orange sphere of light with a ring around it.  It was relatively large compared to the small stars behind it.  At the southeastern side of the ball and ring there was a blur almost as if an engine was letting out intense heat.  We just stared at it for a while and then went back inside.  I don't remember if it was moving or not, I just remember being terrified and wanting to go in my home.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
IT was a large circular motion of lights in a stationary position.;2000-05-27 02:00:00;30 minutes;IT was a large circular motion of lights in a stationary position. We observed a large circle of lights moving slowly around and around. The object or craft appeared to be stationary but these lights kept moving around and around above our house. They seemed to be behind the clouds perhaps a mile above the ground. The lights were dim but could be seen through the clouds. It appeared to be very large. Maybe the size of a football field but circular. ((NUFORC Note:  The report seems somewhat reminiscent of advertising lights, rotating in a circle.  However, generally the individual lights are reported to come together at a an imaginary point in the center of the circle.  We do not know what caused this incident.));39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Wish I had written down the exact day and time but i didn't want to report it.;2004-08-05 00:00:00;3 minutes;Wish i had written down the exact day and time but i didn't want to report it. I worked at an office complex in cincinnati ohio as a security guard. It was after midnight is all i can remember and i had just stepped outside the front door of the office building when i saw this circular craft almost about tree top leve fly almost over my head in front of me.   It had a big circular white light under the craft which glowed very slowly blinking on and off sort of like a christmas light would.  The UFO was crusing along very slowly and as it got over me i could hear a like a whisper of a humming noise.   Then as it went by i stepped out further to take a look at it as it went by and the thing looked like it saw me and went behind some trees to fly off in a direction it didn't want me to see. I  felt like the craft was trying to avoid me seeing which direction it was heading because i already had seen it.  Anyhow i never reported it because i didn't think i would have my job very long if the company thougt i was a kook.   So years later i wished i had always written downt the time and day but i tried to just forget what i saw. I heard you comment on 55 wkrc radio a few weeks ago and you said if people saw something they should report it because you said you wondered how many people never reported seeing a UFO.  This is all i wanted to say. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Orange round object appears dims and reappears no sound;2005-05-14 02:00:00;10 min;Orange round object appears dims and reappears no sound Storms were rolling in and like normal my husband and I retreated to our front porch to enjoy the lightening show. We kept witnessing bright circular bursts of white light that reminded me of a flash and I kept question it b/c it was like no lightening I had ever witnessed in my life.  At about 2 am we began to see a orange shape circle off in the distance and I was drawn to it b/c it looked like a setting sun though small in comparison and it began to dim then went away and within a minute or so it was back as bright as could be in the same location it appeared to stay in the same position the entire time before once again dimming and disappering.  We live in the flight path of the Airport so I've grown accustome to the sounds and shapes of planes. The object had no sound like the planes that pass over our house with running lights on and landing gear down.  About 45 minutes to an hour after the event a plane did fly over our house and I remarked how we heard it and could distinctly see the red and white blinking plane lights. During our encounter of this odd orange blob, I sent my husband running for our camera. I got one capture that when blown up looked like two curved smiles. The whole event lasted about 10 minutes and then within 1/2 hour we heard this odd tone that neither of us could place.  My husband, is usualy the logical skeptic, said there is no way it was a flare nor weather balloon because it remained in the same position and the way it dimmed and came back so bright was not typical of either. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides a photo of two objects against a night sky.  We do not know what the objects are.  PD));39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

Round with bright white light that would go around then I saw search light type light up into the sky in mulitiple directions. Had other colors in sporadic patterns light up.Stayed in place for about 1/2 hour then disappeared. I went to another vantage point and saw it again doing the same actions. Later it was to the north of Cincy.  Did anyone else see this? Would have been so close to the airport, but it didn't move in any pattern it just hovered very high up within plane paths I think. I have seen these before but I never wrote about them. Am I crazy?;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

I was inside my home looking out the windows of a french door that is in the rear of my home. The view is looking directly south. The meteor shower was being observed from west to east across my back yard. The night sky was crystal clear with no clouds being visable. I had been watching the shower approximately 15 minutes when I noticed a gun metal grey object stationary in the sky. It was just below a bright star. It stood out in the clear sky.I would say it looked more like a plate. As soon as I noticed the object, it accelerated in a straight line due south at an incredible speed and was out of site in a second. I did not hear any sound as I was indoors. There were no lights on the object. I was stunned by the speed of this object. All I can say is that I saw what I saw.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Two bright round crafts darting around in the clear night sky.;2010-06-18 22:24:00;5 minutes;Two bright round crafts darting around in the clear night sky. My girlfriend and I had just entered the highway to head home when we both looked up in the sky.  The sky was cloudless and a perfect night to see all the stars and the moon.  We both immediately saw two round bright lights heading towards each other and just when we thought the two would hit each other, they seemed to ping pong away from each other in different directions.  One aircraft went to the right of us and eventually we couldn't see it anymore.  The other one headed in another direction and then it seemed to levitate in one spot, completely stopped in the sky and that's where we saw it for another 5 minutes before we turned off the highway and couldn't see it any more.  We didn't see any blinking lights on the craft that would indicate it was a plane.  They also seemed to be playing with each other--nearly coming together and just when they seemed to want to hit each other, they deflected away from each other. We are both 50 years old professionals(! sales manager and para-legal). My girlfriend is very religious and also believes in the existence of other life forms and UFOs.  She was completely convinced of what she saw that night.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

Glowing Orange Fireball/Lights Seen at Turpin HS Football Game.;2013-10-11 20:00:00;4-5 minutes;Glowing Orange Fireball / Lights Seen at Turpin HS Football Game. This sighting occurred while at the Turpin High School vs Anderson High School football game at Turpin, Anderson Township / Cincinnati, Ohio.  I was happy to discover that another group of eyewitnesses from the Cincinnati area submitted a video account of this occurrence on the NUFORC site. At some time around 8PM, sitting in the stands at Turpin's football field, facing west, I noticed what appeared as one bright single orange light/ball of fire, that seemed to hang in the sky for a few minutes before breaking into two, then three glowing orange balls of light.  People around me were witnessing it as well.  A few kids were pointing and laughing say, Ohhh, look at the UFOs.  I was amazed as these balls of light would slowly drop downward, and at first I wondered if they were some kind of night time military exercise, or maybe skydivers, or luminary sky lanterns. The lights appeared to me to be nearby Lunken Airport (which is due west from Turpin, about 4 miles away), which led me to believe it was possibly a night time parachute jump with the parachutists wearing flares.  But I ruled that out as these glowing balls of fire seemed to hang in the sky far too long to be parachutes.  So I wondered if maybe they were hot air balloons, as they would float downward, but them rise back up in the sky.  But I counted that out as the glowing lights would fade in and out of view--and this was on a perfectly clear night.  They appeared to be maybe 2-3 miles in distance from us. As I was about to conclude they were parachutists on a night jump, suddenly they moved upward at least a thousand feet and orbited around each other a bit, then appeared to be floating in a triangle shape, then appeared to go back into one ball of fire.  Very strange.  At one point when they first broke off from one ball of light to two, it appeared that two of them were linked by a long shaft of light...honestly it appeared to me by the color of it that they were connected by a rope of fire. If you watch the video:    [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4ouLci9bNN_dzJIY2NPQnlSLVE/edit?usp=drive_web]  just after the two minute mark, a streak of light appearing much like a shooting star, shoots off to the right from these balls of light (watch from the lower part of your screen.  I witnessed this as well. I was pretty freaked out, and had pointed it out to a few of my family members after watching it for a good 3-5 minutes, saying, Please tell me what we are looking at?  Finally they faded into darkness--just totally disappeared.  Naturally, I would glance around the sky from time to time the rest of the night, wondering what we had just witnessed. After they faded out of view, one lady nearby was quite unnerved and started exclaiming, Did anyone just see that??  A lot of people did, but I thought it was odd that most everyone just glanced at it, then shrugged it off and kept watching the game, which by the way was boring and untypically quiet for a Friday night football game.  The reason I bring this up, I was listening for aircraft engines, but it was very quiet. This is where it gets weirder.  By this time, it was half time, and naturally, I was glancing around in the night sky to see if there was going to be any more of this phenomena.  I turned around and behind me, facing an easterly direction, appears a ball of light, in what I estimate to be 1,500 - 2,000 feet in the air.  It's bright, moving slowly toward me, and so I'm wondering if my mind is playing tricks on me and if I'm just being paranoid.  So I rationalized, surely it's a plane in a landing pattern heading towards CVG airport.  However, it looked like an orange ball of light, not a landing light.  Also, I was looking for the flashing wing tip lights as it appeared to be getting closer.  Never saw them. A man I had never seen before was standing directly behind me.  I asked him, Do you see what I'm seeing?  Is that an aircraft, or what the heck is that light behind us?   This guy NEVER looked back behind us to see what I was pointing at but instead looked me dead in the eye and said, You're not supposed to see that.  WHAT THE FREAK!!  I said to him, Do you even know what I'm talking about?  So he casually glanced back and said something like, Yeah, have you ever heard of Area 51?  You're not supposed to see this.  Just pretend it never happened.  Now, THAT was weird.  VERY. WEIRD. I grabbed my wife, who was busy chatting away with someone, wanting someone to tell me I wasn't crazy and said, LOOK!  Tell me what you see.  Is that an airplane?   Suddenly the orange ball of light which was slowly moving toward us seemed to break off into TWO BALLS of glowing orange light.  It was as if the second ball of orange light came out from behind the first ball.  But they were heading right towards us, at this point it seemed less than 1/2 mile away.  I wondered if they were going to pass right over us hoping I could get a good look at what they were, but suddenly they faded out.  It was as if a passing cloud blocked them out, but then they were gone. Were they planes in a landing pattern line up, or was this the same lights we saw some 30 minutes before?  The mystery guy?  I never had seen him before, and I never saw him after I pointed it out to my wife.  He may have simply been a dad of one of the students attending the game but his response was very strange. And where did he go?  I think it was interesting to observe how most everyone just chose to ignore these strange lights as something they just didn't recognize and went about business as usual, watching the game.  Only the two kids initially pointing, laughing and acting silly and scared about seeing UFOs, and then the one lady who was vocal about what she had witnessed, besides myself asking her what she thought they were.  Everyone else just shrugged, and I think were afraid to admit they had just seen something they couldn't explain. This morning while surfing the web, I came upon this site and looked up the date of the game, wondering if anyone had reported the sighting.  I was glad to find a confirming video of it.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801

My 7-year old son and I were leaving a friends house, when he asked me what was in the sky.  I look up to see 3, what seemed to be, fiery orange balls with comet like tails.   They were moving methodically in a figure eight pattern.  They were moving at a steady (not slow) pace. 2 of the 3 crafts disappeared and the 3rd dimmed almost as if to disappear then the other 2 fully reappeared for a brief second then they just vanished!   My son was, and still is afraid of what he saw.  My mind is blown but I'm pretty sure this was something unearthly.   It was a cloudy night and these were under the cloud cover, low flying.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Westside of Cincinnati, bright red and blue lights making abrupt U turns and then dropping straight down from the sky, quick as light;2014-01-01 22:15:00;2:30 minutes;Westside of Cincinnati, bright red and blue lights making abrupt U turns and then dropping straight down from the sky, quick as light On the eve of the first new moon (January 1st, 2014), around 10:15p.m., I was out walking my dog in Western Hills, Cincinnati, Ohio.  I had walked up to the top of my street (which is approximately a 32° angle uphill), and turned the corner walking to the right and past the first house on the right.  My dog then stopped to use the bathroom in the grass, while I stood there looking north, staring off into the dark between the large clearing of two houses.  (This would be looking in the direction as if I were at the top of my street looking down).  I saw what looked at first to be just airplane lights, red and blue, out of the corner of my eye.  Didn't think much, until I realized these lights were moving usually fast.  So I turned my attention directly on them, and within a few seconds, saw the lights stop and hover, and then all of a sudden they made a complete sideways U-turn and started headed east.  I literally said out loud, What ((deleted)) is that??!! (talking to my dog).  Just as quickly, the lights swerved back to the left (west), and flew for just a second until it stopped and hovered again! I proceeded to get my phone camera out to videotape, and as soon as I pulled the video application up, the red light in the sky went out, leaving just this fluorescent blue light, which suddenly dropped straight down, quick as lightning! Like it just fell from the sky.  I focused my camera on where I thought the light had dropped, and caught it on camera shooting straight back up..  it then dropped down once more, which I saw with my eyes, but did NOT catch on camera (even though my camera was focused right on it) and between messing with my phone, I did not see the light come back up.  About a minute later I saw both red and blue lights in the sky again, seeming to fly north until they just disappeared suddenly.  It was the strangest, scariest, yet most exciting experience I've ever seen…  I didn't even think it was real.  I asked my dog, Did that really just happen!?  It happened so quick, I literally almost doubted myself.  But there is no doubt about what I saw.  There was definitely SOMETHING there, and it was NOT NORMAL, and NOT an optical illusion...  I cannot explain it to be anything other than a UFO.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
