I got out of the car, unhooked the bungee cord holding my hood closed, and as I was lifting it, I noticed a cross-shaped stationary object hovering in the eastern sky. It was the brightest object in the sky. I got on my CB radio to call a trucker to confirm what I was seeing... but it was dead. As I stepped out of the car... I suddenly lost all balance, and landed in a heap next to my car... receiving several scratches in the process. As I looked up to the sky again... the cross disappeared. Just then, my car started up and started to roll towards a creek bed off of the side of the road... I must have left it in gear. I started to walk home... and managed to catch a ride from a police officer. This account was also recorded in the Hamilton County Sherriff's Department booking office, as witnessed by two police officers and my attorney.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
