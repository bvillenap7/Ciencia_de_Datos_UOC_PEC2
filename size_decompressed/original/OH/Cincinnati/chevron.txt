It was traveling in a straight line moving very fast. It was going right toward the moon which was pretty full if not all the way full. I was able to snap the first picture as it passed in from of the moon and snapped a picture right after and the craft had moved a significant distance from the first photo. It began dancing all over the sky in circles and zig zagging and then it changed colors from blue to green and then headed South/east and was gone. I was only able to take 2 pictures. I work in infection control.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
