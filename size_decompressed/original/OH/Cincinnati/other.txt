I am reporting this for my friend, the witness, who has no internet at the moment. he says that thursday night, between 8 and 9 pm he was on his way home from work. He works and lives in downtown Cincinnati.  On his way home some women asked him if he saw the UFO, which he he then looked up in the sky and saw the object.  He said it was shaped like a stop sign, (octagonal), had a red light in the center and blue lights on the rim.  He said one of the rims was extended off of the object, which he saw move into place, so the object was then symmetrical. He said it was fairly high up in the sky, and he said it seemed there was a haze around it, making the lights dim... or not as bright.  He said it was large, the size of a dinner plate in scale to his extended hand.  He said there were multiple witnesses, and when he got home neighbors from his apartment building were told and they went out and saw it as well.  He said he also told a police officer in the Kroger store who ignored him and thought he was a crazy.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
Large object  seen north of Cincinnati, 9 lights grouped in 3's, 1 group broke away  to follow us;2005-11-06 01:30:00;60 seconds;large object  seen north of Cincinnati, 9 lights grouped in 3's, 1 group broke away  to follow us My husband and I were on our way back from a concert in Cincinnati (destination Circleville) to pick up our children from my inlaw's.   We were on a back road highway and I'm not sure of the name of it, but we realized we were going the wrong way.  I was driving and to our right, over a huge open field high up in the sky, were 9 lights (grouped in 3's) forming a huge triangle. They were slowly rotating as one large object. (The lights were at the corners of the object and were a bright glowing white.)   After one of the 3 groupings broke off from the formation and started following us.  They were not behind us, though.  They were beside us going at the same speed we were, but keeping a large distance between us.   We turned around in a driveway to head back in the right direction and all 3 disappeared.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
ufo over walnut hills in cincinnati;2010-08-11 11:12:00;2 mins;ufo over walnut hills in cincinnati I was outside having a cigarette when I saw this bright ball of light start to move in the distance at first I thought it was moving slowly and my eyes were playing tricks on me, however as it got closer I started to notice the lights on it an it made no noise at all I live near a hospital that uses care flight so I am accustomed to seeing helicopters and airplanes and this was definitely neither the lights went out only once and they came back the craft was closer and seemed to appear brighter than before.  The ball had unpredictable movements it moved up and I saw a series of lights pretty much covering the bottom of the craft all the while is was still moving across the sky as it got closer I noticed it changed from a cigar type shape to a shape similar to a boat.  I watched it fly over my apartment building until I could not see it anymore and then I ran into the house.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
2 Strange lights that disappeared.;2013-12-31 23:00:00;2 minutes;2 Strange lights that dissappeared Looking from just north of the downtown area to the south east, I witnessed 2 lights that seemed initialy like airplanes flying in some kind of formation and had to be miles away.    Moving to the north, it was one behind the other at the same speed and never moved further or closer apart and therefore seemed liked the same craft.  But from the distance which they appeared to be, this would have been a HUGE aircraft.   As i watched through the trees they suddenly disappeared.   I watched for minutes and looked from all different angles and never saw them again.;39.1825302507151;-84.4759718165801
