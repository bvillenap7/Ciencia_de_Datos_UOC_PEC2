Row of white lights, stationary, with possible black dome above.  ((anonymous report));2016-08-13 00:00:00;?;Row of white lights, stationary, with possible black dome above.  I saw about five white lights in a row with two larger white lights on either end in the southwest sky, at 11:00 p.m., on Saturday, August 13, 2016. Through my binoculars it looked like there was a dark dome shape above the lights. What could this be? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
