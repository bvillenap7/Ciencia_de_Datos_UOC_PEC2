Orange light in the sky, that vanished suddenly.;2011-10-30 00:00:00;2 min;Orange light in the sky, that vanished suddenly. There was 3 of us standing outside and my husband looked to the sky and told us us to look up.   We saw an orange ball of light which appeared to move slightly in the sky and then suddenly vanished before i could get the camera out.  We know it wasnt a plane because it was orange and didn't blink AT ALL.;41.3703999999999;-81.8586999999998
