Red/orange orb over Martinsville, Ohio.;2014-09-09 21:00:00;5 minutes;Red/orange orb over Martinsville, Ohio. Tuesday evening on September 9th, 2014, at approximately 9 P.M., I was outside walking my two dogs, when I looked up and saw a large bright orange/red orb floating slowly in a horizontal line.  It looked like it was on fire and continued to move across the sky for about 5 minutes.   A helicopter came into my view from the southwest at 9:05 P.M. and the orb seemed to burn out and disappear.  The helicopter then flew in the exact path of the orb.  The whole thing was very strange.;39.3135;-83.796
