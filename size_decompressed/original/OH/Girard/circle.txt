There were atleast 6 round reflective objects flying randomly when they all came into a horizontal line the first 2 on the right flew straight up and stopped the third one in line flew down and to the right the fourth one flew straight down the fith one went down and to the left and the last one went straight back and out. When they were flying the reflected very bright light and almost looked like they were rocking back and forth.Traffic was stopped on the road and I had to ask someone if they saw it too.What is it? and what could it be was  almost anyone could say. Then they all lined back into the horizontal line the first two dropped back down and they flew off fast! No more than 15 seconds later a military craft -c9 or c10-flew by....and the show was over.
