I was sitting on my couch in my house And I noticed a light outside through  my window. I live near the intersection of highway I-71 where the bridge goes over West West Salem Road in Burbank, Ohio.  I was facing west looking Southwest out of my window.  The back ground is a fairly large open field with a high tree line in the back.  I've lived in this house and seen this view of this area for most of my life so I understood that this was something strange in the sky.  I'm trying to explain this is best I can and I'm using a voice recorder so I can actually talk and that makes it easier for me.  I saw a very small bright light in that said area and it caught my eye right away so I shut the TV off and I walked to the window I open the window which I had to kneel down band open the screen on the window and I just looked at the object.  Within 5 minutes, the whole thing lasted 5 minutes.  The pin sized object groove a fairly large glowing ball the same color as fire.  I would have to say that it lasted around 5 minutes.  I wasn't looking at a clock or anything I I just focused on it.  It stayed bright in the sky for around 5 minutes and then it just faded back out to a pinprick and disappeared.  It was still the whole time it never moved from one spot which automatically indicated to me that it wasn't a helicopter or something.  To describe myself I am NOT a a UFO buff by any means and I've never reported anything before.  But this is been significant enough to me that something was very strange and this is my first step in finding out what it possibly was.  Thank you!;40.9635;-81.998
