About a second after the boom and flash i looked up and i saw a bright ball of light about the size of a penny and it had a tail about the size of a pencil. The tail was white and the ball of light falling was blue and white. My friend about crapped himself and i was freaked a little but it was pretty cool to see. the light was in the southeastern sky came from the middle of the sky down it fell for about  5 seconds and then was gone and this was the whole experience.;40.2738;-81.8662000000003
