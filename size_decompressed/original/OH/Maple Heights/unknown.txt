A bright light high in the sky. The object was stationary. My 96 yr old mother saw it also. I took my mother in sister's house and went around the block where I live.  The object was still in the southwestern sky. I took out my iPhone and took a still photo of it.   Then I switched to movie photo and almost immediately the object went straight up in space and disappeared in about 3 to 4 seconds. After I looked at the photo, it looked like 2 objects which my eyes perceived as only one. I still have the photos. The color of the object was a bright yellow/ orange.;41.4128;-81.5607
