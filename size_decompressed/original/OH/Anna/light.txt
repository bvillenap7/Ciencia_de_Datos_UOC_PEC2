While traveling northbound on I-75 at the 100 mile marker, near Anna Ohio. I noticed a bright light. It was apprx. 45 to 60 degrees up from the horizon travelling from west to east. The object was apprx. the size of a thumb at arms length. The main body was bright white and had a trail behind it with varied colors of blue, red, and yellow. The trail also had 2 or 3 additional white lights in it which appeared to be more objects rather than part of the trail. The trail looked more like burning particles or embers rather than a fire trail. The trail was very long about 10 times the length of the main body. At first glance I thought I was witnessing a missle flying through the air. I witnessed these events for apprx. 30 seconds. It did not appear to me to be a meteor, but could have possibly been an extremely large piece of space debris.;40.4035;-84.21
