The fireball, I thought it was a meteor at fisrt untill it turned. I'm not sure of its shape for it was too far and fast to get a real good look at it.  The weather was clear with some clouds moving in from the west. I stopped on the side of the road and looked at the sky.  I could see some lens shaped clouds. I wasn't able to see too many stars due to the clouds.  Yet, I was able to see the brightness of that fireball just a few minuets ago. I called The UFO center about 01:11.;40.8552;-82.3143
