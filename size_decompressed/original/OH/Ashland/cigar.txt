Super bright white wingless aircraft persued by fighter jets directly over Ashland, Ohio;2011-08-30 09:35:00;5 minutes;Super bright white wingless aircraft persued by fighter jets directly over Ashland, Ohio At about 9:35 a.m., Tuesday, August 30th, 2011 my coworker and I heard the roar of jets directly over the bulk oil plant where we work.  We went out side to take a look and saw two fighter jets moving overhead but not away from the area.  They seemed to be moving around what looked like maybe a plane with no wings.  We could easily make out the details of the jets, but the craft they seemed interested in was a super bright white.  As long or maybe a little longer than the jets, but without wings. The only marking I could see on it was a grey spot at about the middle of the length of the craft that went from the bottom to about half way up the side. The white color was really unusual and really bright.  I didn't believe in ufos, am ex military so I've seen aircraft before, but now I'm not sure what to believe.  Other than myself and my coworker the pilots of the two jets and the pilot of a small single engine plane that passed overhead but below the craft and jets! would have seen this, so I know it was really there.  The white color of this craft may have been the brightest I've ever seen.;40.8552;-82.3143
