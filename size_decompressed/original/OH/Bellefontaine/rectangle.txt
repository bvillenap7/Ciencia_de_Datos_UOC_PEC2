Rectangular object moving very slow;1987-08-15 19:00:00;15 mins +;Rectangular object moving very slow The date is a guess at best.  I know it was in the late 80s.  The sky was clear, and it was warm weather.   I was traveling west of US RT 33 when a faint light in the sky caught my attention.  I put my head out the window to make sure it was not a reflection on the windshield.  It was still there.  I pulled over to listen, but I could hear nothing.  It was very high in the sky.   The best way to describe it would be that it was a rectangular shaped object that moved very, very slowly to the north.  It seemed to have four circles that appeared to pulse rhythmically in order - as one would brighten, the one before it would dim.  What really got my attention was the only bright light (not overly bright, at that) that came from it.  My main thoughts were that it was some type of aircraft since it had what appeared to be the same type of light that I had seen on commercial aircraft that were like headlights.   The odd thing about it was that the lights were going in the opposite direction of the way the object was moving.  The lights also carried out far into the sky.  Without having any point of reference, I will describe the difference in my own terms.  If normal aircraft headlights would extend out one inch, these lights extended out 5 feet.  Even though I know I saw something, to this day, I have no idea what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));40.3626000000002;-83.7564999999998
