It's dark ( 3 A.M.), away from city light, not clouds at all, I'm not sure what direction they're going. Two red light with one following another, I first thought maybe it was a airplane traviling at fast speed, but the lights weren't blinking and it was going at a very fast speed.  When those two objects make a real fast turn ( about 120 degreed ) going up ward, I knew it's not a airplane. Couldn't really tell what shape they are.  Not really bright red light.;40.3626000000002;-83.7564999999998
