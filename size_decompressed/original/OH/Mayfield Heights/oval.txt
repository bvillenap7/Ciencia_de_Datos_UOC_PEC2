Drove further down road when I realized it was way to close, approximately 2 feet above a house.  It was moving very slowly and silently towards the tree line. I stopped in the middle of the road and tried to take a video.  It was blimp sized and before it disappeared it was very low to the ground.  Canâ€™t explain what I saw.;41.5166;-81.4558
