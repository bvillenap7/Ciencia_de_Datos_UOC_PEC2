2 Strange black figures in my room resembleing my parents.;2004-08-10 01:00:00;As long as I was awake.;2 Strange black figures in my room resembleing my parents. My little brother and I have bunk beds. On this one day not much different from any other we had gone to bed around 10pm and in the middle of the night I had woken up and I saw 2 black humanoid figures in my room. I tried to look at them closely and they seemed to resemble my parents. When I tried making sure they seemed to freeze in place and I was overcome with a horrible fear and felt forced to lay back down and close my eyes. The next day I asked my little brother if he had seen anything and he told me that he thought our parents had been in the room. I then asked both my mother and father if they had been in our room at any time of the night and they both had said that they haven't been in our room the entire night. I believe what I have witnessed was 2 alien lifeforms and I do not know if they had done anything to me as I slept. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
