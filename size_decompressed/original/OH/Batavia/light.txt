Pulsing light in South-West Ohio (Clermont County);2008-11-03 21:00:00;2-4 minutes;Pulsing light in South-West Ohio (Clermont County) On Monday, Nov 3rd, 2008, my wife and I were heading east-bound on US32 when we noticed a bright, stationary light due east.  The light was about the same intensity of a car's headlamp, but pulsed with a 2 second interval in between pulses.  We maintained contact with the light as we exited U32 and continued to watch the light which did not move in over a 2-3 minute period.  At this point, the light began to change color and turn from a whitish color to a red-orange and then disappeared.  My wife initially thought it could be a low flying plane or helicopter, but was disproved when we saw a helicopter flying to a local hospital...and seeing planes flying in the area.  While planes and helicopters have strobe-type lights, these where much larger and pulsed very slowly.  There also where no running lights common in other aircraft.;39.0967999999998;-84.1487999999997
