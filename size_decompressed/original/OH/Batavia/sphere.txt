Orange/Red Spheres seen by four people in Southwest Ohio;2012-10-22 17:30:00;20-60 seconds;Orange/Red Spheres seen by four people in Southwest Ohio On Monday, 22 October 2012 at approximately 7:30pm EST I was standing out of doors with a group of three other people at 1131 Old. St. Rt. 74, Batavia, Ohio 45103, when two groups of bright orange/red lights caught my attention. The first group came from the east and traveled in a WNW direction. The second group came along about ten minutes later, appearing from a more southerly direction and traveling on a NNW line. If I were to draw a line on a map, the first group was heading towards Indianapolis and the second was headed towards Fort Wayne, Indiana. I was not able to distinguish any physical form within the lights so it is hard to estimate their elevation, but they appeared to be very high... my guess would be approximately 10,000 feet. The lights also seemed to be traveling very, very fast. The first set of lights was visible for about twenty seconds, the second group I was able to track much longer... nearly a minute. If I am correct about the elevation of the lights, I would say their rate of travel was over twice that of any jetliner I have ever seen in the sky. It is worth noting that in both instances there was absolutely no sound apparent from the objects. The lights were in a group of three that would coalesce into a single light, then split apart to three separate lights and then again regroup. This happened repeatedly with both groups of lights. The color of the light varied from a light orange, to orange to red. This coloring was also fluctuating. Estimating the size of the lights is again difficult as there was nothing concrete to offer comparison, but when asked how they looked in relation to a star or the moon it gave me an idea to perhaps explain it. If the moon were the size of a basketball then the lights would be about the size of an American fifty cent piece. Likewise, if a star were a dime, the lights would relationally be roughly the size of a basketball. So, they were much larger than a star, but much smaller than the moon. I hope this helps.;39.0967999999998;-84.1487999999997
