My 3 dogs started barking and I looked up to the window just in time to see what looked like the top of a blonde head go along the bottom side of the window from the outside.  I live in the country but on a well traveled road so nobody would be brave enough to snoop or ding and ditch.  So I was watching from the table to see if I seen anything else. My dogs stayed on edge through the whole event.   Then in the sky I seen a bright light blink on. I watched it confused for about 3 minutes and when I realized it wasn't moving I went to the window to get a better look. It was so bright that it had light streams coming off either side.  That's when I yelled for my daughter to bring my phone so I could record it.  She woke up both my sons in the process.  We recorded it, not sure how long.  A new smaller light came off the main light to the left.  Then a short while later a small! light camr off the right and then dropped down fast and went under the main light to the left.   Then my memory cut out on my phone.  As I was trying to delete older videos off my phone the main light just blinked out.  We waited to see something else but nothing happened.;39.0967999999998;-84.1487999999997
