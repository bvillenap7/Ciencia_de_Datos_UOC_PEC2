Multiple UFO Sighted West of Franklin, OH.;2013-07-13 22:15:00;7-10 minutes;Multiple UFO Sighted West of Franklin OH UFO SIGHTING JULY 13, 2013 10:15PM EST  On the evening of July 13, 2013 at approximately 10:15 PM my wife and I were enjoying a campfire in our back yard on Hillsdale Drive, Franklin OH 45005.  We noticed an orange cylindrical comet shaped object traveling across the sky at a high rate of speed (much slower than a shooting star but about twice as fast as International Space Station), traveling from East to West 265 degrees magnetic.  Object was losing altitude and a orange tale was noticeable, tale increased in length (Est. 10 mile long tail) as it approached the far west skyline.  Approximately 20 degrees off the western horizon object stopped in sky and ejected 2 orbs then ejected an additional 2 orbs for a total of 4, they were very bright and would move in different patterns from a triangle to a horizontal straight line pattern slowly ascending then descending. We watched this activity for about 7 minutes when they slowly disappeared.  I did take some pictures of this event, two of the pictures are somewhat skewed due to me moving the camera, all objects were perfectly cylindrical.  I also attempted to take video with my I phone but it locked up because it was processing pictures.  The video is short but shows how objects were moving in the sky, and pictures clearly show arrangement of objects. My wife and I witnessed a similar event last year in Centerville OH, but our observation time was cut short due to the many trees and buildings in the area.;39.5334999999999;-84.3056999999998
