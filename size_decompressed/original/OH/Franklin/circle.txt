Two large red lights over franklin ohio moving then vanished.;2012-10-27 21:05:00;3 minutes;Two large red lights over franklin ohio moving then vanished. We were leaving the store when my two kids got my attention about the two red lights in the sky, if you held your arm out holding a penny that was about the size, they circled each other then stayed at the same level, one would move up and down a little while the other barely moved, then they started coming closer to a point that if you held a quarter with your arm straight out that was about the size and we didn't know what to think, after about 30 seconds or so they started moving away, we set and watched them for about another 30 seconds or so then they moved up a little then vanished, we didn't hear a sound and they were large to be that far away.  This happen about 9pm. wish there would have been something on the news, i am so curious about what those lights were. A lot of people stopped to watch them.;39.5334999999999;-84.3056999999998
Circular object with vivid red and white lights.;2015-10-22 20:30:00;3 minutes;Circular object with vivid red and white lights. Last night I stepped out into my backyard about 8:30 pm and out a distance from me through a tree clearing I saw a round object with red and white vivid bright lights hovering with no noise what so ever.  It seemed to be spinning but not so fast that I could not make out the light colors.  I was in shock and walked closer to my door in fear but continued to watch.  And then it just disappeared. It was definitely not an airplane.  My dog was outside with me and began barking as well.;39.5334999999999;-84.3056999999998
Franklin Ohio October 2020;2020-10-04 22:00:00;10 minutes;Franklin Ohio October 2020 3 of us were on the porch at 10:00 pm looking at the skys as we do every night. No drinking or drugs involved. I was taking pictures with my night vision camera phone of the sky.I saw nothing.Then I turned around again and saw this bright star looking thing that was white bright glowing object about, a street over.We live in the country.  Then it moves to the left.  My family said, it's a plane. I said, it's not moving, it's not a plane. So they kept laughing at me until it disappeared. It re-appeared farther away and dipped down behind houses then suddenly it rose up and lit up lights that circled around it, that's when I snapped a picture again but my camera hesitates on night vision and it got it, but it didn't get the whole craft. I got 2 different pictures of lights that were red and a picture of the clouds where you can see something huge and red in the clouds. Then it left.  This is happening almost evening Every night here.  I just didn't believe myself until last night. The color red that appears on my pictures is quite different quality of light.  It's not a color I've ever seen before. The brightness is like a star brigbt. If that makes any sense.I have pictures but of course they aren't the best.;39.5334999999999;-84.3056999999998
