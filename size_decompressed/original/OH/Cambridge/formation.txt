line of strange blinking lights over eastern Ohio sky;2010-10-31 23:30:00;5 min.;line of strange blinking lights over eastern Ohio sky Myself and a friends friend saw a group of 6 to 8 (simultaneously) blinking lights in the eastern sky. The 3 leftside lights went north ,in a straight line and disappeared. The remaing lights stayed,while one went straight up to around 100 times the distance of the original line of lights. It then took off north faster than a meteor,then disapeard.I looked back to the original line of lights, and they were gone.  Both myself and my bud's friend saw the same thing.;40.0267999999998;-81.5773000000005
