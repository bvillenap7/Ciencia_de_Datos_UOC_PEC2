Star like object/ blue, green, red,and yellow/stationary over Englewood, Ohio.;2014-04-19 22:00:00;constant;Star like object/ blue, green, red,and yellow/ stationary over Englewood Ohio I walked outside to smoke a cigarette, when I looked up into the western part of the sky about one and a half thumb lengths above the horizon when I noticed a bright star like object.   At first I thought it was a plane because of the red and blue and green lights but it never moved.  It looked like a really bright star that blinked red, blue, green and yellow lights.   I called my dad out to look and he was stumped as well.   I got a small pair of binoculars to see it better and the red, green and blue colors really stood out…changing constantly.  The object never moved.   We live only 4 or 5 miles from Dayton Airport so who knows.   It was brilliant enough that I found this web site and I’m writing this.  I've never seen anything like it.   The blue and green colors were very pronounced and crisp…the red as well.   I hope someone else out there saw this.;39.8744;-84.3287
