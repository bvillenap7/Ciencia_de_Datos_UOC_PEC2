Orange fireball.;2013-08-11 23:00:00;2 minutes;I was taking my dogs for a walk around the block as i do often around the same time of the night.  I heard a plane in the distance that was coming in to land at the dayton international airport.   I was standing in a school field so my view was not blocked by anything.  I scanned to the west and was watching the plane with its landing lights come in and flew right over head.  Then i started walking again and i looked back to the west where the plane just came from and there was a  bright orange fireball hanging in the sky.  I would guess it was about maybe 1000 feet up and just looked like it was sitting there or moving very slowly.   To be honest the first thing i thought and said out loud ah someone let a chinese lantern go.  I watched it for about 1 minute cause it looked really cool and then it started getting bigger and brighter.  At that point, i said hmm what the heck is that and then it took off to the west and gained altitude until was gone.  This thing shot off way faster than a jet ever could of, it was like shot out of a slingshot.   I don't know if anything close to this has been reported before but it kinda freaked me out.  I wonder if the plane reported it to the tower cause where it was in the sky they would of seen it.;39.8744;-84.3287
There were multiple balls of light moving in every direction.;2013-09-23 19:30:00;15-20 minutes;There were multiple balls of light moving in every direction. I was on my home from work and me and a co worker noticed a strange sliver in the sky.  It also appeared to have a single ball of light circling it.   As i exited the vehicle i went to get a clearer look around the other side of my apartment building.  As i continued to watch 4-5 more balls of light appeared moving, up, down, left, and right.    I continued to watch them for about 15 mins from outside and about another 5-10 from inside.   Confussseedd?!  What was this?;39.8744;-84.3287
