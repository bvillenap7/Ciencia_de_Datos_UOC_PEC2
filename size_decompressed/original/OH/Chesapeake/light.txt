green lights changing to blue floor vibrating;2002-12-25 06:45:00;30 seconds;green lights changing to blue floor vibrating no objects were seen but a green light appeared through three windows that are not located on the same wall while this happened the floor began to audibly vibrate (a loud whirring sound) the light then changed to blue then stopped i then looked out the window and observed nothing conversation about what that was started seconds later the lights and vibration started again i admit to being a little apprehensive about looking while the lights were still going but as soon as they stopped i looked out the window and saw nothing at this point i had to know so i went outside it was dead silent no cars on the road no one to be seen it may not sound like much but it was more convincing than any of the strange lights i have seen in the sky i felt the floor vibrate it was close question how do you live a normal day to day life when you know for fact that there is more out there what are you suppoosed to do i guess you just keep on breathing that's all;38.453;-82.4473
There were bright lights in strange formation;2004-03-28 21:30:00;10 minutes;There were bright lights in strange formation We saw a form of light in the sky that did notmove, it was just hovering.  I live near a landing strip, so it is not unusal to see planes around.  But this did not look like a plane.  My girlfriend told me she had been watching the object before I noticed it, I have told her that things like that creep me out.  SHe said that the lights on the object changed formation.  I did not catch that, but I did see the three lights alligned in a straight line.;38.453;-82.4473
