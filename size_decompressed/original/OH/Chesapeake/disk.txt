Daylight disc with flashing lights.;2017-04-05 17:30:00;2 minutes;Daylight disc with flashing lights. At about 530 PM (EDT), I was sitting in my backyard, watching the birds, when I saw something moving through the sky below cloud level and at a quick but not overly fast pace, at a steady South to North direction.  I first thought it was a bird, until it was nearly overhead, when I realized it was a disc shaped craft, spinning counter clockwise, and flashing lights in a red-green-white pattern.  The white light seemed especially bright considering it was still daylight. The object made no noise as it passed and continued South to North until it was lost from view.;38.453;-82.4473
