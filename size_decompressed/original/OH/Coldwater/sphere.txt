On Friday Night 10-10-08 at  approximately 11:15pm  myself and a coworker were talking in the parking lot after work , I looked up in the sky and saw an object moving across the sky it looked like small hot air balloon, it was absolutely silent, it crossed right over our heads and at that time we both knew it was'nt a hot air balloon. It was moving at a pretty good rate and flying lower than a small airplane would. The bottom of the UFO looked like it was on fire, it was bright orange in color, moving from the South East heading North West, after a minute or so it just dissapeared. We left the parking lot and on my way home I spotted it again and followed it west bound for a half hour or more. I would get close to it and then it would appear to move faster and be far away again , the whole time it was very visible to me and still looked like a burning ball of fire it would change altitude frequently and moved from the left to the right. I followed it until I was in Indiana and it was still heading West flying pretty low to the ground.;40.4823;-84.6561000000001
