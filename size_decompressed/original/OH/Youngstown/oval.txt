A large oval glow hovering over a house was reported in Youngstown on a late April night.;1999-04-13 22:30:00;aprox 8 min.;A large oval glow hovering over a house was reported in Youngstown on a late April night. It started at a bonfire in my driveway that ended around 22:30 (10:30 pm). It was a humid April night. I was helping my neighbor carry his chairs back into his garage when he just stopped moving and looked into the sky. I then turned and looked as well. There was 1 of them. It was an oval shape that was very illuminated. It didn't have a distinct amount of lights...the whole thing was glowing. We stood there looking at it for a few minutes before reality struck us. Fear spread through our bodies and we ran into the garage to watch from behind a window. We were both in 7th grade so you can understand our fear. The craft just hovered above a house across the street. Ocassionally it would turn a little bit or lower, but it generally stayed in the same place. When I realized nobody would beleive that we saw this thing, I ran home to grab a camera. I came running back to find my friend still in the garage. And as they knew i had a camera they turned quite rapidly and in a matte! r of seconds it was completely gone. Not even a trace of its existance. I didn't get the picture off in time. That was all. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  There were several sightings reported from Ohio during the spring of 1999, so we do not know which one the witness alludes to.
