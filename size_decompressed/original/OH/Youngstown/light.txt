While heading east on I-80, between Youngstown and Cleveland, my business partner and I were heading back to Michigan after attending a comic convention. We were...well, making good time and I had looked at the clock on the dashboard and it read 10:22pm. My partner and I were discussing our trip when he said holy... you know... and I looked out the windshield. Above the cross over an over pass some distance back was a bright light with a light green outer ring. We figured it might have been an aircraft or a light on a tower, till it dropped straight down with out an arc, with increasing speed so fast that it looked like someone had taken a picture at night and moved the camera while the film was being exposed, giving it a solid line of light because it fell that fast. Then it did a 90 degree turn like it was a giant log ride and shot out at the horizon. Disappearing from sight. I looked at the clock on the dash after seeing it and it read 11:38 pm. I don't completely believe in this stuff, but after seeing that object fall and speed off, I can't think of anything it could've been. Nothing, that I know of short of a TOW missle, can arc in a 90 degree turn at that rate of decent without tearing itself to pieces. A TOW missle would have had a fire trail, instead of a white light with green outer ring. Then there is the matter of losing our time. Abducted, I don't know and don't think such a thing can or normally occurs, but we lost almost 45 minutes of time. The driver had been checking the time to gauge the trip back throught the whole trip and to keep from getting tickets. So what was it?? And what happened to the 45 minutes??;41.0992713381556;-80.6503948462933
Orb like lights in pretty straight line;2012-09-22 22:10:00;3 minutes;Orb like lights in pretty straight line Me and my wife were driving north on state route 11 about 10:07pm she was driving and suddenly asked&quotwhat are all those lights up there?&quotwe were about 3 to 4 miles from where route 11 northbound merges with 80 eastbound.&quotI replied I don't know&quot we were traveling about 65 miles per hour.  As we got 1 mile or less from the intersection we where right under the lights it seemed,I would guess they were about 2 to 3 thousand feet high,they were white orb like in appearance.I remarked to my wife,&quotthere must be two dozen there gonna get a lot of phone callls on these&quotreferring to the police. They were very clear to see and basically right over the highway.  They were in a preety straight line and spread out about 1 to 1.5 miles.  As we merged on to 80 eastbound I put my window down and had to look back and up to see the last 5 or 6 lights as we drove away.  We couldn't wait for the 11:00 news to come on expecting them to be mentioned but nothing was mentioned anywhere.Highway was not extremely busy but there was other traffic people HAD TO SEE THEM.I wish my wife had pulled over so I could have got pics with my phone and watched longer.;41.0992713381556;-80.6503948462933
