I pulled over to get a better look and realized that there was more like 9-12 of them.  The lowest was at about 700 ft and the highest I would say was about 2500 ft.  At one point the craft had stopped and then they started to move again.   When they reached the highest elevation (2500 ft) they disappeared one by one til they were all gone.  I believe I saw these in the eastern sky.  When I saw them I knew right away, that these lights were special.   I never saw anything like it and there was no sound what so ever.  When you looked at the lights they appeared to have 3 or four colors. It was absolutely awesome to see.;41.0992713381556;-80.6503948462933
