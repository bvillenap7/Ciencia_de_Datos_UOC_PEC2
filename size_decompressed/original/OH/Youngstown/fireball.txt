On the second occasion i filmed the crafts for about 9-10 minutes and they all disappeared as they traveled across the sky. But it was not a sudden disappearance, they all faded. they traveled slow and methodically remaining in 4 separate formations and made no noise. They flew of I-680 from Boardman.
