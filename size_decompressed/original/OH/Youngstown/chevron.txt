I was driving home on country road, (New Buffalo Rd.) and slightly ahead above to my right was the most brillant red object moving steadily but not fast.  I was so startled I pulled my car over and watched it move west.  It seemed to be a chevron shape and after 5 or 6 min.. it just disappeared or the light went out.  It was the most amazing sight it was a large red object not small light a light on a plane.;41.0992713381556;-80.6503948462933
