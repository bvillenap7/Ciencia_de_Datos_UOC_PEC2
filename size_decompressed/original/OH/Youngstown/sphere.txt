At first I thought they were hot air balloons, but as I watched them they did not move. As the clouds were going bye they sat there not moving.I thought that was strange....So we watched for a while longer,trying to guess what they were.Then the most amazing thing happened,they started to move.Four of them came together to form a sqare,then one left as the three remaining formed a triangle,then the one that left came back and formed a retriangle.The most amazing thing I have ever seen!We watched for over 45 mins.and they never left the sky where we were looking at.Looked like silver shiny balls in the sky.Another lady and her daughter saw them also,I know I believe in ufo's now cause I used every possible thing it could be.Airplanes move,hot air balloons can not sit in midair without moving with the wind,at least not 45 mins.The clouds moved under them for they were very high in the sky.Still tell this story today and am amazed with what we saw! Date I gave you is not sure,If you are interested I could find out closer date because there was a fire at a paint factory near bye,so I could date it better.I would like to know if others have seen this,so I hope you read this and give an explaination!Truly Amazed!;41.0992713381556;-80.6503948462933
White light in sky moving quickly away at unnatural speed.;2006-11-15 23:45:00;20 seconds;White light in sky moving quickly away at unnatural speed. It was only one craft, I wasnâ€™t expecting it. I was walking along heading home from the store and was looking up at the sky at the stars because it was finally a clear night, and I was watching a very bright star in the sky for about five seconds when it suddenly moved very quickly diagonally upwards to the right of my vision and disappeared. The star/sphere was white, it looked about the brightness level of the north star however it dimmed as it moved across the sky, as if it was moving not only upwards but away at a quick speed.
