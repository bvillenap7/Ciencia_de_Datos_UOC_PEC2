Round object flying through the sky;2000-11-06 21:30:00;2 minutes;Round object flying through the sky It was at night and my friend and I walked out of a school building and I looked up in the sky and we saw a round object high in the sky.  It had lights circling around it and below it and it flew by overhead quickly.  We were pretty shocked.  It definitely was not an airplane.;41.6867791575901;-81.3398984749478
Weird star behavior.;2012-06-05 23:45:00;3-4 minutes;Weird star behavior. Tonight at about 11:45pm EST I think I saw a UFO. I was out watching the sky with my binoculars.  I was looking at Mars in the western sky. I turned to the North to try and spot something I saw earlier.  In the NW sky I saw a bright white light, and seemed to be round like a star.  I thought it was a star until it moved. Watching with my binoculars, it traveled straight East. It moved slowly at first, then began to pick up speed, then slowed down.  It seemed to stop briefly, then continued on slowly.  It did this several times. Finally it moved slowly towards the horizon, disappearing from my view behind a tree. Other than the strange behavior mentioned above, I think it was a UFO since it made no noise.  I had seen a UFO one other time, about 1975 in Akron OH.  It behaved similarly and had no sound. I have been watching planes and stars for many years.  I know what’s obscure. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

No processor! Circle of faint reddish glow traveling from south to north in the dark. It stopped then moved and stopped again and moved;2020-08-08 22:00:00;10 seconds;No processor!  Circle of faint reddish glow traveling from south to north in the dark. It stopped then moved and stopped again and moved north bound. There was no noise or fast turns. It looked weird amongst the stars.  I live near Lost Nation airport and know what planes look like at night and this was no plane.  Just wanted you to check for satellites or air force doing tests?  Please check as it was unusual and I can’t believe it.;41.6867791575901;-81.3398984749478
