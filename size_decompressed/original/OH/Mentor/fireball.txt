There was one object that was a reddish orange looking fireball that glowed constantly. The UFO looked about the size off a basketball.  The object seemed to float from SW to NE and was traveling directly over head.  The time span of this event was approximately 5 mins. Then the UFO just vanished in thin air.  All the spectators in our area saw the UFO.  There was roughly 10 people who were commenting aloud about what they all saw.;41.6867791575901;-81.3398984749478
2 spheres bright red/orange over northern Mentor sky 8/31/13 at 20:50.

I was driving south on Mentor Park Blvd to the intersection at Elmwood Rd after coming from Sycamore Rd. I saw what seemed to be a very bright star in the sky so I slowed down to look. As I was watching it got bigger and what seemed closer, I saw that it looked like it was on fire and there were sparks coming from the back of it as it moved north-north west and lower. I literally put my flashers on and got out of the car to look because I then thought it was a plane that caught fire that was descending rapidly. Then to the left of this (or east of it and slightly 'behind' it, came a bright red sphere with an even brighter yellow/orange center, looked like the leaf or flower of a plant called 'tropical anthurium' that has a red leaf with a yellow thing sticking out of the center. So now I am thinking a piece of the plane has broken off and is trailing a bit far behind so I called 911 and reported it in case it was a descending plane on fire.  Within 5 minutes the first one disappeared northwest and the second one seemed to disintegrate or turn to a small pinpoint within seconds.  Never saw anything like this in my 56 years and nothing reported crashed in the news.;41.6867791575901;-81.3398984749478

Size of orbs possibly a round 300 feet round circumference.  The orbs were traveling at the same rate of speed, and maintained their distance before they were out of sight.  Also, witnessed by my wife. Video recorded from my balcony, approximately 20 feet high.  Estimations of height, size and speed are rough.  I'm not an engineer, however I am high school educated, some college (still going). Quick backckground info, my wife (college grad) and I are both white Americans,millennials, and of sound mind. We have seen them before, myself around 10 times.  I will review my pictures and videos too ensure that they were time stamped correctly, and write reports on those as well.;41.6867791575901;-81.3398984749478
