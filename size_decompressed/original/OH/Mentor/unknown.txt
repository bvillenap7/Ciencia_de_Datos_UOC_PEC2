At first I thought it was just a cell phone tower till we came to a clearing in the trees and it was a little to high for a tower. I watched the red blinking light till we get to the light to turn onto Rt 90 going east. When we reached the stop light, the red blinking light then turned into two three lights,. It looked like three small lights, red, wight and blue, but my husband said it wasn’t blue that he thought it was green. The lights just stayed still in the air, that is when I thought it might be a helicopter. My husband then turned on the entente ramp to the highway and I figured I would never see it again. I watched as we drove out of it’s view. I was amazed at what I saw and stared repeatedly looking for it. Withing a minuted it came into vew again and was now heading down Rt 90 east. As I watched it, it was now just the red light again, then it changed to a bright white light. It was now moving very fast and almost caught up with the car and I thought it was going to fly right over us, then the light flared and became very bright for a second, I watched it the whole way home. My husband was looking at it from the rear view when we saw it flare again. We reached our exit and stopped at the stop sing. I couldn’t believe it, but the light also stopped. As we turned off the ramp onto the road I watched the light, it had stopped and was just sitting there in the sky, I could now see the red light again with the white. I took a drive back up to the highway about 30 min later to see if it was still there and it was gone. I need to know what that was. Was it a helicopter or a UFO. Please let me know.;41.6867791575901;-81.3398984749478
Wave formations of lights exceeding 70 aircraft that looked like small balls of fire.;2014-11-21 19:24:00;30 minutes;Wave formations of lights exceeding 70 aircraft that looked like small balls of fire. My buddy and I went outside last night to smoke a cig as soon as we Iooked up in the sky we saw a formation of lights moving south, southwest. Then for the next 20-30 minutes my buddy and I watched about 23 different waves of lights ranging from 7-15 lights per group.  They were reddish orange in color.  They kinda looked like balls of fire but they were dim  The formations looked like how Canadian geese migrate for the winter or another example would be the shape of a long bow.  They were also able to switch place like they were playing games with each other. This isn't the first time I've seen a ufo, but I hope it's the last for my sanity.  I know what we saw, I know most won't believe this but I watch the stars every night because of what I saw on my farm when I was a little kid,  I know the difference between government, commercial, and the unexplained.

The first thing that came to mind was that these beams of red light were linking with my total being.;2015-07-26 21:00:00;4 minutes;The first thing that came to mind was that these beams of red light were linking with my total being. I was coming out of Quaker State and Lube on Rt. 306 in Mentor, Ohio, through the back door.  Two people were looking up at the sky at about a 60 degree angle.  I looked up and saw about 7 objects with distinctive red lights on the front.   The size of these were about one third the size of the front of these objects.  Kind of resembled a red laser beam.  I remember about 35 or so years ago when an engineer in my apartment demonstrated one he was working on for Bailey Meter in the late 70's.  These objects were in a stationary delta formation.   I wanted to contact the people (man and woman) in front of me about 30 yards, but was somehow blocked or deterred from doing so.   After a few minutes the lights on some of the objects started to fade and then the objects themselves.  I noticed a delta shape to the left wing on one of the closer ones.  I left as all objects began to fade.  These objects were in a delta formation.  They were stationary and seemed to have come from a North-South direction from Lake Erie about 3 miles away.
