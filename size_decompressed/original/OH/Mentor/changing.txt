Her eyes are goos but not great. Also,she doesn't watch ANY science fiction stuff like movies or X-files,etc. I recorded her story and now i'm giving it to you.  Got up around 2 am to go to bathroom just finished when all the lights went out. Saw lights ouside. There was a square balloon with lights turning inside, went to the other window there were two more farther away looked out front window there were 3 more over the golf course and down the street were 3 or 4 gold discs. I was a bit tired so I thought to go back to bed but I turned around to watch more. When I looked out the front window, I saw a gold disc by the neighbors garage. There was a sack on top of it (brown) and a tube or rope coming out of it then it started to pump up or inflate then I started getting scared. The lights started to spin and it looked like a head coming out of it. There were more gold discs coming.  Just as I started to look away I saw cars coming.  There were 4 or 5 black sedans coming exactly 3 feet apart doing about 90 mph (this is also a semi-dead end street which sees like no traffic except residents) I thought they were coming to tell the martians to cut it out (doesn't know about MIBs) Then I went to bed.  This is what she saw as she told me.  I really don't know if she was the only one who saw this or any objects like this.  The cars really scared me, I hope they don't know she was watching.;41.6867791575901;-81.3398984749478
