A light fading in and out  brightness going north and south.;2004-06-27 00:10:00;2 min;A light fading in and out  brightness going north and south. At 0:08 to 0:10 my fiance and I love to star gaze. So taking advantage of the clear skies over the weekend. We sat in lawnchairs in the driveway next to the side door of our house. Our house is about 6 to 8 houses from the lake, which gives us clearer skies away from city light. These things we see show up very often. They enter the sky or into view like a slow meteor getting brighter from yellow-brown to white-yellow. It got no larger or brighter than venus. It becomes visable directly over head going north. It also fades slowly in and out of brightness. From dim to bright to dim again, it takes about 10 seconds. It does this 4 times, while traveling a little slower than a satalite, until it goes out completely at an 45 degre angle from the horizon. I seem to see many of these things lately with different paths going north most of the time. When they come from the north, and become visable aroung the same angle to the horizon, they always stop when dim for about 10 to 20 minutes and go back north while doing their pulsing til they go out at the usual angle some where over the lake. Fiance and saw 4 of them last weekend at 1:00 to 1:45. I saw an intensly bright one on 5/5/2003 at 23:30 doing the same things exept for how bright it became visable. It got brigt enough to just make my eyes squint, but able to see it begin to light up the trees, house, lawn, everything around, way more than the moon can. I've seen many satalites before, and they don't fade flicker or stop. They just keep going. Has anyone seen these things?;41.6867791575901;-81.3398984749478
Four orange lights in sky flying, moving closer, then disappearing.;2014-06-06 23:40:00;5 minutes;Four orange lights in sky flying, moving closer, then disappearing. I saw 4 orange lights in the sky, I have never seen anything like them.   Minutes later I saw another one.  Two went out of sight, I recorded the other two, and the on that appeared after, and the seemingly disappeared. They moved at a planes speed, but I have never seen this color light, and they disappeared.  One moved towards the other, and then away. I am in shock.. 28 married maled, maintenance man.;41.6867791575901;-81.3398984749478
4 small white lights, equidistant apart, appeared in a straight line that moved at a rapid rate across the night sky.;2019-09-26 22:15:00;10 seconds;4 small white lights, equidistant apart, appeared in a straight line that moved at a rapid rate across the night sky. 4 small solid white lights, equidistant apart in a straight line, initially appeared to look like stars due to their high altitude but did not change shape or intensity.  Skies were clear, no clouds in the vicinity.  Lights appeared stationary at first with surrounding blue hue then began to move silently from east to southwest across the sky. As the lights began to move, the blue hue disappeared.  Their speed increased rapidly and they disappeared in the distance within 4-5 seconds.  Lights did not leave any kind of heat signature, smoke or vapor trail visible to the naked eye .;41.6867791575901;-81.3398984749478
