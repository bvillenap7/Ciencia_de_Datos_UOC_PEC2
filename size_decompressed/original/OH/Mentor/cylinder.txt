Cylinder like silver object moving in west to east direction over NE OHIO;2002-08-05 20:15:00;1 minute;Cylinder like silver object moving in west to east direction over NE OHIO My mom and I were walking our dog and noticed a long silvery cylindrical shaped craft fly over our house. It had no jet trail and did not look like a plane. I was facing south, and it moved in an easternly direction. Sky was clear blue, no clouds obstructing my view. At first I thought might be an old b29 bomber, but I couldn't see any wings. My mom said that she could see it rotating. She thought it may have bee a glyder, but it seemed to big for that. I know the space station is currently visible over north america, but I'm positive it wouldn't look as big in the sky as the object I witnessed.;41.6867791575901;-81.3398984749478
