I looked up i looked at a near by street light on the next street down (Beverly)from us on Margene Dr. just above the Street light, above the trees, but looking like it was some distance out (I figure it to be around the 84MM), on I75 Just North of piqua, there was this Golden Orangeish, Redish Yellow Ball of pure energy. It's Color faded from golden Orange, to pure white, & was surounding its self in same Marble Colored Clouds. i turned to get my VCR Camcorder, but it was gone, with out a trace. NO sound, NO blinding Lights, NOTHING. Me being into Star Trek, I continue to look for Sky distortions, & Spacial Anomalies. I also have Pix of UFOs, from a NASA live Broadcast, from their ISS Cameras.;40.1522999999998;-84.2501999999995
