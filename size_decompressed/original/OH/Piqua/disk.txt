Hello, I have seen objects several times in my life. I will list below the year and what was going on at that time. 1985  My 1st sighting, I was in 6th grade, we just came home from food shopping, it was late, my dads friend stopped by, I went into the backyard to help with the groceries, while talking to my dads friend, I noticed lights above me, when I looked up, I saw a large, round craft that was encircled with lights, it moved so slow, I stood there watching it, as it was barely above my home, I asked my dads friend “What is that” he stated “I don’t know”. We watched it moved towards my garage, then past the alley, then disappeared out of sight. It was so strange, I never spoke of it. This sighting was in Upland, CA   1989 I was 16, while driving to pick up my friend who lived in Ontario, CA, I noticed an object moving quickly through the sky, it was cylinder in shape. What caught my eye, is that while flying, the craft seemed to be flipping, or turning, it was so strange, that I found myself watching it, suddenly just disappeared. This was in the evening, it was dark out. Summer 2000 While driving through Phoenix, AZ, it was late, I was on my way to California from Texas, the sky was changing colors rapidly which caught me and my brother’s eye. It was about dusk, when the first craft appeared out of clouds it came, suddenly there were 2, then next thing we knew, there were 5. We started to talk about the crafts and it was like they heard us. The crafts were round, and almost in formation style, when one craft lifts looked like they were signaling to the others, then the others started to signal back. The next thing we knew we were being followed by the crafts, I know it sounds strange, but they stayed with us till we reached our destination. I was so scared I even stopped at some gas station to call my husband, and mom to tell them I was being followed and didn’t know what to do, of course they didn’t believe me, needless to say, I never pulled over to sleep that night, and drove straight through to California. During the time I was driving ! they would put a light on us, then back away, they would hide behind building then pop out of know where, then they drive along side our car. I had never been so scared, and it really sucked no one believed us.  March 2009 My daughter actually seen this one, she states she was in her room, when she heard a noise, she walked to the window to see 2 crafts, one was hovering above the other. The other one was in our backyard, hovering, she states it was round with lights all around it. She states after a few minutes, it finally started moving towards the front of the house, she came running downstairs saying “I just seen a UFO it going to the front” so we all ran out to the front porch, but we did not see anything. This was in the evening after dusk, in Piqua, ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  We have invited the witness to re-submit her reports, each separately from the others.

Silver Disc & Flying spheres;2014-06-14 20:53:00;40 minutes;Silver Disc & Flying spheres On 06-14-2014, I was night fishing at Swift Run Lake on state route 66 in Piqua, Ohio.  I arrived around 7:00 PM.  At 8:53 PM I noticed a blue arrowhead shape craft and a yellowish gold teardrop shape craft stationary in the sky.  The craft began to glow or emit light.  The craft were doing the exact same manuevers at the exact same time.   I watched the crafts until two other crafts joined them at 9:33 PM.  The other two that joined the glowing spheres was a silver disc and the other was a black sphere with a red glow.  I saw and heard what appeared to be three military jets chasing towards them in which they all shot off into different directions.;40.1522999999998;-84.2501999999995
