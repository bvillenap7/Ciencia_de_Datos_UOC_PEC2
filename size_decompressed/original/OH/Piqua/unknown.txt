I did look finally.It was hovering about 20 ft. above the ground,but I couldn't see it because it was covered with a misty glare,about a mile away.

Not sure what it was, the lights made me think it was a car, but I wasn't sure...;2002-06-15 21:00:00;about a minute;Not sure what it was, the lights made me think it was a car, but I wasn't sure... Okay, I don't care if you don't belive me because I was only 8 or 9 at the time, and even i doubt myself. We lived in the country and, surprisily enough for me at the time, the street was really busy. I have a window directly in front of my bed, and the neighbors driveway came up to about half of the length of the window. It was really late, and i was suppose to be asleep but i was too excited because we were doing something the next day. I'd counted at least 5 cars go by, and that was alot, before the UFO actually came. I never got up to look at it, but suddenly, out of nowhere, what looked like car headlights looked like it drove into the neighbor's driveway, but it didn't stop halfay, where the driveway ends, it went halfway, stopped for a second or two (it felt like hours), and then it drove across the rest of the window and disappeared. I was very scared of things like that back then, so i dove under the covers and waited listening for any sounds of something a car might make. After another car drove by (that made six), about 9 minutes later, that's when i got up to look and there was nothing there the neighbors weren't home, either. I didn't believe in stuff like that until two years later, and I just dismissed it as a car. You can throw it out if you want, but I know what I saw. (Like I said, i was only 8 or 9, and i wish i had photos or something.) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));40.1522999999998;-84.2501999999995
