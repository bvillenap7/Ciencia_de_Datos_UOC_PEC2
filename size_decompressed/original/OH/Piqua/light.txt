I was driving Northbound on I-75 through Piqua when I noticed a very bright white light with a bloom effect almost directly above me.  It was slowly moving West, and I don't think it disappeared, it moved out of my frame of vision because I was driving.  There may have been a small red light on it, but was hard to tell because it was very bright.;40.1522999999998;-84.2501999999995
Two lights were moving at high speeds in unusual formations.;2014-02-21 21:00:00;1 minute;Two lights were moving at high speeds in unusual formations. I witnessed two craft flying at a high velocity apparently on an intercept course.  Just before colliding they split off sharply but only briefly before assuming a close formation heading west.  They appeared as stars or satellites look crossing the night sky.  How far out they were I do not know.  There was no sound to speak of.   The only thing they could have been other than other worldly craft, in my opinion is fighter jets, but I would have thought I would have heard a roaring sound.   While I do live within 30 miles of a major air force installation, I have never seen fighters in my skies except during the annual air show.   Interestingly the maneuvers I witnessed looked like those performed at an air show.  Iâ€™ve never seen anything like it.;40.1522999999998;-84.2501999999995
