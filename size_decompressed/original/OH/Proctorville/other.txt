Strange silent object with bright amber light flying over Huntington WV;2009-08-24 21:50:00;1 minute;Strange silent object with bright amber light flying over Huntington WV My wife and I were outside our home at about 21:50 on 08/24/09. My wife asked me about what looked like a star in the west. Then she told me she thought it was moving. The light was amber and looked like a landing light on an aircraft except for the color of the light. As it got closer the object seemed to get lower. We started to notice blinking lights of an orange, red, and green. We thought it was still a plane at this point. As it came over top of us however, we noticed and unusual pattern to the lights. There were light in front back and sides, not the pattern of a plane or helicopter. As it came closer still, it passed directly over us. I could make out a dark shape something like a 6 or 8 sided octagon-like shape. The amber light was in the middle, lights close together in front, spaced on the sides, and spaced to the back. Another shocking fact is that there was absolutely NO SOUND! As the object moved to the east and across the Ohio River, I gained ! perspective on it's size and speed from the time it passed over me until it moved between and over the hilltops on the other side of the river. I would estimate it was moving about 150 mph and was about 30 feet in diameter. It actually seemed to slow as it came over our town and lowered in altitude. This was in the almost opposite direction of the local airport. I have lived in my home for years and am in the glide path of one of it's runways. This was unlike anything I have ever seen. Also, at an estimated 1000 to 1200 feet in altitude, I did NOT hear any noise at all.;38.4635;-82.3523
