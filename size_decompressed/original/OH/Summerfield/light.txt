Thought it was a star, but then started moving and then stopping again.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable star sighting, we suspect.  PD));2009-06-21 23:00:00;1 hour;Thought it was a star, but then started moving and then stopping again. South-East Ohio, June 21, 2009, around 11:00 p.m. we believe to have seen something in the sky that was not a plane. At first it sat in the sky and we thought it was a star. But it was so bright, so we kept watching it. Then, it began to move. It made no noise at all and it hovered lower than most planes do. It looked like it was blinking, but also, it moved quickly and slowly. One minute, it would sit still, the next minute it would begin to zoom around.  It disappeared but we stayed outside and watched the sky for about a half hour. Then we saw a plane with another UFO behind it. The plane was blinking and at a constant speed and the UFO was behind it and then it began to go faster, and flew lower and under the air plane and then went ahead of the plane and kept going faster and farther up and up into the sky. There were about 5 of us out there that saw these odd, star-like flying objects.  What were these? ((NUFORC Note:  Probable star sighting, we suspect.  PD));39.8013;-81.3277
