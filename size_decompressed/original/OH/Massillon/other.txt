Cluster of Y-Shaped Objects Over NE Ohio;2001-09-16 23:45:00;Lengthy;Cluster of Y-Shaped Objects Over NE Ohio While walking our dog just before midnight on Sept. 16 we saw among the stars several Y-shaped objects overhead slightly to the east, west and south. They appeared to be in a fixed position, perhaps a bit lower than the stars. Their movement was slow, just like the stars, indicating the objects' perceived movement was actually due to the Earth's rotation. The base of the Y-shape was the brightest, looking somewhat like a cluster of three adjacent stars. The angles at the top of the Y were like lighted lines, not as bright as the base. On some nights we have seen a short line extending downward from the middle of the base of the Y. We have since seen these objects moving from west to east between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. every night when the skies have been clear. They are probably visible much later into the night, but we haven't stayed up later. Our suspicion is that these are U.S. spy satellites grouped in position for sightings of overseas locations as part of the War on Terrorism, but attempts to confirm this have failed. We have been told the spy satellites are too high in the sky and to small to be visible without powerful telescopes, but we have also read that newer, and perhaps bigger, spy satellites have been in development for some time. Some other people in our area have also seen these Y-shaped objects in the sky. Has anyone else in other parts of the USA or in other nations seen these objects and/or have an explantion of what they are?;40.8058597402598;-81.5183181818182
