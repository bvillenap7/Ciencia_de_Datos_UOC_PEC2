Orb and shooting star in Massillon, Ohio, with video link.;2014-08-25 20:35:00;15 minutes;Orb and shooting star in Massillon Ohio with video link. While riding my bicycle along the towpath in Massillon, Ohio, August 25, 2014, at 20:35, I witnessed what at first looked like an orange fireball to the east moving north.  The object glowed and seemingly pulsed for a few moments but then went black.  It was still visible, so I continued to watch. After a few minutes it started glowing again and then went black again.  Soon after that, I lost sight of the object, but curiously what looked shooting star flew in the direction of where the object had been. About 10 minutes later, as I approached my home, I witnessed another object that was bright white in color flying slowly but somewhat erratically, again in the eastern sky.  I lost track of this object quickly because of tree cover. Here is a link to the video of the first object that I captured on my iPhone 5. Unfortunately I stopped filming before the shooting star appeared. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7SLiKNydxM&feature=youtu.be;40.8058597402598;-81.5183181818182
