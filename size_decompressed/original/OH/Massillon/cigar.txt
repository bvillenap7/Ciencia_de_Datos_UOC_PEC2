There was one cigar/bone shaped white thing going N.W and coming from the south. It was white and had a little red (looked like a light) towards the top. It was at 6:30 p.m EST. It was about 23 degreese out at the time. It was moving pretty fast, I was getting the camera as fast as I could but didn't make it in time to get a picture. It was just traveling in a straight line (N.W as I said above) and was kinda hard to see. Very small looking from where I was standing. I didn't notice anything else really, I first saw it when I was standing out by my dad's van and when I looked up it was there.;40.8058597402598;-81.5183181818182
