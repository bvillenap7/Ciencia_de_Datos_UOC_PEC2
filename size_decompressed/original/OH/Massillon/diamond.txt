The second object was located at 4 degrees north same altitude as primary object.  Third was 151 degrees SE and Forth 159 degrees south. Third and fourth objects were apparently one mile off the ground on the horizon. The objects hovered only moving about one mile west during the three hours twenty minutes I observed the objects.  Objects appeared to be a diamond or triangle shape until I zoomed in with my camcorder and observed a honeycomb / pentagon shape with circulating Blue and white light patterns. Objects were visible during night and daylight until 7:20am EST when I was no longer able to see object due to increasing day light.I recorded 40 minutes of video during the night until dawn.;40.8058597402598;-81.5183181818182
