Walking across driveway looked up saw shiny black oval shaped craft traveling W to E then changed direction to S.;2018-05-28 13:00:00;3 min;Walking across driveway looked up saw shiny black oval shaped craft traveling west to east then changed direction to south bound.  It would slow down and speed up and continued south until fading out of my vision. I did pull out my phone and video taped some of what I saw.  Not a plane or a helicopter because there was no wings or sound.  The sun did reflect off of its surface and I did notice a small airplane fly by it heading north.;40.8058597402598;-81.5183181818182
