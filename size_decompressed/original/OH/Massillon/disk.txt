Red orange orb view from directly below on May 26, 2013.;2013-05-26 23:15:00;20 minutes;Red orange orb view from directly below on May 26, 2013. On May 23, 2013, Thursday, about 11pm., I was sitting looking into the west sky.  At a 45 degree angle and 1.5 miles due west was an red orange orb.  It moved north slowly, stop and move again.  Sometimes it  would just hang there and the light would go out and come back on.  It moved slowly.  No sound heard. After 15 mins. the lights went out and it was gone.  The height was just below the wisp cloud deck.  It wasn't a helicopter, no lights, just red orange orb.  Not a plane, no lights and would have fallen out of  the sky because it moved slow.  This caught my attention. On Sunday May 26, 2013, I went outside at 10:50pm.  Due north from me about 3 to 3.5 miles out was the same red orange orb in the sky.  It was heading due north slowly, farther away for about 2 mins.  I said to myself, darn I wish it would change direction, do a 180 degree and head towards me.  About 1 min. later it stopped, hung in the sky and started due south from a north position. It did not turn around.  It stopped and started slowly directly towards me, south.  It was about 4 miles out moving 10-15mph at me. I quickly sharpened all my senses because I wanted every detail of what this was.  About 1 mile from me the orb changed to white. I don't know if the color changed or it appeared to change because the angle of view changed, but it was a white orb now, heading directly over me, just below the light cloud deck.  At half mile from me the orb went from white to a very dim dull Grey orb about 10mph. just below the cloud deck.  I had to bend me neck to look straight up at it.  There isn't a light bulb on it, the air around it glows or is ionized. No light bulbs just glowing air, surrounding a circular craft inside this orb of light.  From  the center of this craft to the arc of the circle is perhaps a door. It is not lit up.  It was dark, the rest was lit.  It was 200 to 250 feet directly above me, at 10mph. There was a layer of air  unlit between the craft and the lit air around it.  I was able to see this clearly because the cloud it  was under was very white which made details stand out.  There was no smell in the air and it was silent, moving due south. No sound at all. It moved slowly  over the ridge of  oak trees and I lost sight of it.  It stayed a dull Grey as it moved away and never increased speed and never made a sound. My eyes were seeing what they were seeing, but my brain was having trouble filing info like this because it was something it never was dealt before. From a distance I viewed it 5 more times over the next 2 weeks.  Never close up.  Sometimes it was red orange sometimes white.  It often moved behind a cloud when I view it. Then I didn't see it again. A guy on YouTube videos it  off in the distance. He stopped his motorcycle to use his phone to capture it.  Same thing I saw, but on May 26, 2013, I got an up close and personal view, right over head. After I saw this I quickly realized what I was viewing was either alien or government.;40.8058597402598;-81.5183181818182
