Strobing lights brighter than usual ICAO ident lights.;1999-05-15 23:15:00;30 minutes*;Strobing lights brighter than usual ICAO ident lights. Object(s) observed on 2 occasions Sat May 15, 1999 (1)approx. 2105L in southern sky app. 20 deg. over horizon from obseration point, residence in Perry Township, Ohio. Object appeared as a stationary bright strobing light alternating/flashing white/blue/red. Object observed for approx 20 min. Object did not move throughout observation. Sky conditions were clear. Stars in field of view did not exhibit similiar strobing, and lights appeared brighter than usual ICAO marker lights of aircraft. Oject size appeared to be slightly larger than the surrounding star field and distant. 1 witness of this event observer thought object was curious but attributed it to atmospheric phenonema or plane. As observer returned to inside of residence for the evening approx. 2125L object was still visible above tree/horizon line. Observer not mention sighting until Sunday May 16, 1999. (2) second/additional sighting at 2315L in NNW sky approximately 15 deg. above horizon from same observation point, a residence in Perry Township. Object was a stationary bright strobing light rapidly flashing white/red/blue. Object remained staionary throughout observation. Sky conditions were clear, and stars in visible field of view did not exhibit similiar strobing effect. Object was much brighter than nearby stars in field of view.  Strobing was brighter/faster than usual ICAO marker lights. 2 Witnesses to this event. Object was observed for app. 30 minutes and remained stationary for entire period. During this observation object was observed through  8 X 40 power binoculars, and the strobing appeared to be a circular, primarily bright white with the blue and red flashes in rotation around the white light. The white light was almost glaring and the object appeared to have a clearly defined/sharp profile, like the light from a lazer pen rather than a flashlight, for example. Observers thought light was curious but attributed to perhaps a blimp or atmospheric phenomena. Observers viewed object until 2345 then returned to residence. One of these observers returned to check again at 0100 and light was gone. There is a regional airfield to the NE of the observation point approx. 5 miles away, and this airfield hosts reserve helicopters. But the object light(s) were unmoving and appeared distant in both the 2105L and 2315L observations, and no rotor blade noise was heard. In fact, no sound was heard at all during either sighting. All observers are long-time residants of area and familiar with air traffic patterns around and over house. Observer of 2105L sighting professional with BS degree currently completing Masters, observers of 2315L sighting (1) degreed ex Air Force Intelligence veteran (2) college bound HS student. Observers discovered mutual sighting event during conversation on morning of May 16th. Observers are familiar with pattern of star motion over residence, and considered if the two sighting were of the same object it was unlikely to be a star or plant, as the object would have had to move south to north. If the observations were of different objects the observers found it curious that other stars/planets in field of view did not exhibit similar strobing effect. And if object was an aircraft then itwas stationary/hovered, and the ICAO markers were about twice the magnitude of those normally observed from passing aircraft. We have had blimps in past years, but the observed strobing was dissimilar to the advertising lights normally seen from them in the past. Of particular curiousity was the fact the the object was completely stationary during observations, and did not exhibit movement as the star field moved. Observers are curious as to what they may have observed skeptical about supernatural explanation but thought sighting worthwhile for investigation. Will speak with an investigator but have no interest or desire to have observers names/occupations/etc publicized in any way.;40.8058597402598;-81.5183181818182
My wife and  I both saw a strange orange  glowing ballon  like object that seemed to float silently above the trees;2008-01-01 00:15:00;5 minutes;My wife and  I both saw a strange orange  glowing ballon  like object that seemed to float silently above the trees I began investigating these after my son had witnessed a strange orange glowing ballon outside his window about Mid Dec 2007,  my wife and I assumed he had only seen a plane or such.   ON Jan 1 2008 around 1215 am I saw saw a glowing orange ballon shaped obhect that seemed to float over the trees near our house.  It was bright enough that it caught our eyes thru the windows. We were in differnt rooms and differnt floors but both saw it and ran out to try to see what it was.  It really looked like a miniature hotair ballon with a orange glow or fire color.  Object would rise and lower and moved very slowly.  It was not far away 200' or so but made absolutely no noise.  No strong winds or inclement weather, object was clearly visible and easy to see.  Object just seemed to disappear as I was watching it.   I would like to say that this object has been reported locally several times in the last few months.  I did not know this or that this web site existed until we later starting researching sightings in Massillon.;40.8058597402598;-81.5183181818182
Strange light in sky over Massillon, Ohio.;2013-07-17 03:00:00;10 seconds;Strange light in sky over Massillon Ohio Object moved fast through the sky, outside of atmosphere, size of a nickel, foggy blob like light, lasted about 10 seconds,  I work on a farm, 3rd shift, I see meteors all the time, this object left no trail, made no sound, just a blob like light, if you hold a nickel up that's the best guess I can give on the size, flight path for landing aircraft at Akron/Canton airport is right over the farm, but this object went from north east to southwest, airport is north east of the farm,  I felt very weird, it was a very surreal feeling that I got from seeing this odd thing!  I'm going to have a hard time forgetting this, can't wait to go back to work:(;40.8058597402598;-81.5183181818182
Blue and red light makes radical direction changes, comes to complete stop, and flashes white strobe.  ((anonymous report));2017-06-11 22:00:00;2 minutes;Blue and red light makes radical direction changes, comes to complete stop, and flashes white strobe. Seconds after I noticed a blue light with a with a smaller red light attached to its upper left side which was traveling N to S, the object changed direction abruptly to W to E.  The object turned on a dime, which immediately made me rule out that it was an airplane or helicopter.  I followed it from left to right behind some trees, until it emerged in an opening.  At this time the object came to a complete stop and began to flash a white strobe slowly at first and then faster.  I thought the reason the strobe increased in speed is because the object new I'd spotted it and that's when I retreated in to my house.   There are only two explanations to what this could have been, a drone or something, etc..  Also, I couldn't really tell how far away it was because the lights were the size of airplane lights.

Too high and too fast to be from here.   ((Starlink satellites??))((anonymous));2020-03-05 20:00:00;40 minutes;Too high and too fast to be from here. My wife and I watched what looked like flying stars coming out of the west sky heading north east.  They would then fly straight up and disappear from sight.  They were moving very fast.  When we thought it was over, 5 of them formed a cluster and blended in with the rest of the stars.  A completely clear night sky.;40.8058597402598;-81.5183181818182
