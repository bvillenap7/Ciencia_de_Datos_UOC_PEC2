Triangular-shaped object flying low with white flashing lights over Perry Township in Massillon, Ohio.;2010-11-19 20:04:00;6 minutes;Triangular-shaped object flying low with white flashing lights over Perry Township in Massillon, Ohio. As I was driving north on Genoa Avenue in Massillon, OH, I saw something that was not an airplane or a blimp, or anything I'd ever seen before. It had two red lights on the edge of the wings, with white lights in the middle.  The craft was heading south as I drove north.  It didn't seem to be moving fast.  It seemed to be very low, maybe 100 feet above the trees.  As I drove closer to it, I could see flashing multiple white lights underneath it. I had my window down, and I noticed there was no noise at all.  I tried taking a photo with my phone but it didn't turn out.;40.8058597402598;-81.5183181818182
Fireballs over Massillon, Ohio that formed a triangle and took off.;2013-08-14 19:00:00;10 minutes;Fireballs over Massillon, Ohio that formed a triangle and took off My wife and I and a neighbor witnessed what looked like 7-10 balls/orbs of light headed towards us as we were driving in a residential area.  We pulled over to take a look.  The lights were just above tree height and approx 1 mile away in a non organized staggered arrangement.  They were flying in a southerly direction when all of a sudden one by one they cut to the east and disappeared.  Speed was slow and steady.  No marker lights like an airplane would have. After we thought they were gone, we stood around talking and then headed back to our car and the neighbor headed towards her front door, they were coming back from the same direction.  When they reached the tree line, they dissipated and then suddenly an upside down triangle begin to form with the same lights in no particular order.  Once formed, they broke off and headed east one-by-one again. Within 3-5 seconds of the lights disappearing, a Southwest jet went right through the airspace on approach to Akron Canton Airport.  They had to have seen it. Color was reddish yellow, no sound, no tails;40.8058597402598;-81.5183181818182
