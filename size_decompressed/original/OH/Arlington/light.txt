Dissappearing Orange Ball of Light;2007-11-30 22:35:00;1 minute;Dissappearing Orange Ball of Light While driving down a country road we noticed a large Orange Colored (and White, not a plane, it was not red) light to the north. We continued to watch this large light for about 1 minute. It then dissappeared. It was a very clear night. I have lived in the country most of my 37 years. I was in the Military for 6 years. I am not prone to Seeing Thing. I have never seen anything like this before!;40.8769;-83.6738
