Star-Shaped Object With a Series of Lights;2005-01-21 18:50:00;2-3 minutes;Star-Shaped Object With a Series of Lights Another incident happened to me in Ashtabula around 6:50 pm. My father was watching TV in the living room, and all of a sudden he shouted out for me to come quickly! Running into the living room, and following him out the door and down the steps, we saw a star-like object. (Estimate 5000 ft. up. Cloud cover was little to none.) This object was coming in from the northeast and heading southwest. It had a series of lights in the center of it's star shaped feature. Again no noise! My father and me do not believe it to be the space station because it was too low to the ground, and my father said that he never has seen lights like that on conventional aircraft.;41.8752481605352;-80.7834933110368
