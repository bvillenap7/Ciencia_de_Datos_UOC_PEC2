I was in the gulf area in Ashtabula, Ohio, with my sister and brother in law. It's hard to explain but there was like an electricity in the air and we sensed something was wrong( like we were being watched). We all had the same discernment and decided to leave the picnic area.  We drocve away and as we were crossing over a bridge the craft very silently hoovered above us. I was in the back seat and looking up I saw a checker board of lights on the bottpm of the craft. The lights were square. The cars on the interstate saw it also and pulled off to the side of the road. Other cars slowed down to a crawl to look at it.  It then rose high in the sky and the bottom lights shut off. It circles the city at a hig altitude for about 30-40 minutes.  The next day we searched the newspaper to see if anyone reported it. Not one mention of it in the newspaper and we decided not to say anthing about it.  This was my second sighting. My first was helping my brother work on a car outside. We saw a red triangle high in the sky. It moved very fast in different directions than became a little red dot and disappeared.  None of this story is fabricated with more than one eyewitness.
