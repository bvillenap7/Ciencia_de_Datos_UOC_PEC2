Triangular object followed by two other strange UFOs;2005-01-12 19:00:00;10-15 minutes;Triangular object followed by two other strange UFOs On 1-12-05 about 7pm or few minutes after I was walking back from my brother's house (2 doors down) and I saw this big spotlight object flying from the west. (I live on West 13th St Ashtabula Ohio.)  I was thinking that it was probably Life flight coming into ACMC (Ashtabula County Medical Center) so I stayed at the bottom of my driveway to watch. When it got closer the white light diminished. By the time that this craft was over me I could swear I could see a black triangular shape with a series of different colored lights flashing rapidly on all three corners. No noise! Was listening for chopper sounds. Never heard them.  Well,  I ran back down to my brother's house to have him come outside. When he got outside it was to far away. My brother didn't know what to think. All of a sudden my brother asked,Whats that? Another one (higher up again no noise and flying from the west)lights flashing on and off but no distinctive shape. Just as we were about to discuss what we saw? A third one appeared ( A little lower than the second and you could make out just a little bit of a strange shape.) lights rapidly flashing.  I went down to the Medical Center to see if a helicopter was on the pad to make sure. No signs of a helicopter there. Everything was quiet!;41.8752481605352;-80.7834933110368
