I was talking to one of my neighbors as he was leaving my house to return to return to his home at approx.20:45 hrs. EST on August 30th,2008.  As he walked Eastward on West 57th Street, I was still on my porch he looked to the North and I seen him stop.  He than said to me what the heck is that.  I asked what he was talking about?  He said that up there in the sky pointing to the North.  I could not see what he was talking about from where I was standing on my porch.  I walked over to where he was atanding in the street and looked to the North where he was pointing to. There we stood and observed them,a cluster of sphere like objects all apparantly somehow hooked together.  They seem to change their overall shape and were seemingly moving towards or in a Northerly direction.  I could not detect any specific coloring although at one point I thought I may seen a red light just momentarly. The object really didn't take on any specific shape and as I said seemed to change it's overall shape.  We lost track of the object behind the trees.  I would say we observed them for a total of two to three minutes in all.  I  then went to get my vechicle so that I might just by chance get another view of it.  I was unsucessful in doing so and I returned home.;41.8752481605352;-80.7834933110368
