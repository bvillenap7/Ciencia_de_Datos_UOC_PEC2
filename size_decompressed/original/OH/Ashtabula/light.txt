Sighed orange star like object at  night  which appears to display strange and sudden movements.;2001-06-13 23:00:00;still there;Sighed orange star like object at  night  which appears to display strange and sudden movements. The object looked like a star but a bit larger and was an orange color. It was lower in the sky than your usual star. The first night I noticed it I woke up my brother to look. He said it was nothing and went back to bed. I continued to watch as it moved up and down and side to side. Very strange movement.I have been checking everynight. It's been a month. Then on the night of 07/12/2001 by brother and I were in my back yard tending to my pool pump. It was about 10:00 p.m and we both just happened to look up and saw the same thing at the same time. As my brother and I walked twords my pool the object moved with uo about six feet and stopped right in front of us as if we were being watched or followed. We had two torches lit and a candle which might have made us visible. I don't know anything for sure but I would really like to know what that is. It is always tword the west and has been there for over a month.;41.8752481605352;-80.7834933110368
Lights traveling from North to South.;2001-08-26 04:45:00;4 - 5 min;Lights traveling from North to South. I looked up at the sky while standing in my back yard waiting for my dog (to do her thing) and saw a small, steady light traveling from north to south, just west of where I stood.  It looked like the Space Station in regard to speed and height.  As I continued to watch, the light reached a point directly overhead and then began to glow very brightly (or appeared to increase several times in size).  I thought I was seeing the beginning of a shooting star, but then its brightness diminished to its former level.  This all took but a few moments.  Around the same time, I noticed a second light trailing behind the first at the same distance and speed.  When it reached the same point in its path, it too, glowed and then faded.  I continued to watch both lights until I could no longer make them out.  Throughout the observation, the lights traveled some 35 - 40 degrees. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the first object is not inconsistent with the flare caused by an Iridium satellite.  The second event sounds similar, but we do not know if multiple Iridium satellites can be that close in orbit.  PD));41.8752481605352;-80.7834933110368

Three lights in close proximity to each other seen hovering very high altitude over Ashtabula county then disappear;2015-09-16 19:30:00;2 minutes;Three lights in close proximity to each other seen hovering very high altitude over Ashtabula county then disappear While driving home from getting gas in a neighboring town (Geneva), my Dad an I were about two minutes from our destination.  We were heading east on State route 20 (north ridge road)  About 3/4 (.075)miles from Sanborn road.  We were talking among ourselves when I noticed a light in the sky.It was only a few moments later I noticed that this phenomenon was not just a single white light but three smaller lights in a horizontal line configuration.  At first I thought it could be a plane or helicopter but it was not moving, or had any indications of normal aircraft, such as signaling lights, and there are no radio towers in the direction I was looking. Just before we made the turn off the main road onto our street the lights disappeared.  They did not fade away, they just blinked of, like someone turning off a light.  Unfortunately the lights were too far away for me to draw an accurate picture, and I did not have my smartphone with me to take a picture.;41.8752481605352;-80.7834933110368
