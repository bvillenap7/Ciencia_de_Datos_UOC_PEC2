Down low--no sound I turned out light--it veered sharply, slowly to the right headed north eastward.  By the time ran to back door--it was gone.  Now have binoculars--am watching the sky at night.  This has made a believer out of me--UFO's do exist. I am considered to one who is interested in science the unusual and yet honestly I am considered a bit stange and different by others (whom I consider to be too normal). However--you can be assured that I do know what I saw was real and not a plane nor a helicopter.  I still do not know what it was but I am watching the skies now.  I am divorced, live alone in a 3rd floor apartment with large window that is nice for viewing the skies.  I study astrology--was studying psychology at KSU.  Recently the sky has been cloudy since 3/12 & I am watching at 10:10 pm each night to verify if there is a 10:10 flight pattern.;41.8752481605352;-80.7834933110368

Objects apprear to have bright silver lighting running down the middle. Moving slowly,one moving east, another appears and is moving west, they criss-cross.  One moving to the west disappears then reappears.  One moving to the west disappears.  One moving east disappears.  Before they disappear, a jet is seen going east.  No noise.  Two adults are watching this. Ages: 20's and 40's. Women,homemakers.  We are at a elementary school with another adult and 3children. Children ages:12,7&7. They are riding bikes on the other side of the building, they do not see anything. Around 9:30 pm, the other adult and children join us at the front of the school building.  Bright silver object apprears, bright silver lighting, red and yellow lighting toward center. This object is very slowly moving toward us.  We are all on bikes, scared we all start to take off for home, looking up at it, it is following us. Glancing back it disappears, glancing back again it appears and following.  We get home,looking out of house window,we no longer see object ((NUFORC Notes:  No other reports received for this incident yet.  The description seems to us somewhat reminiscent of a sighting of a blimp, but we suspect that blimps flying in formation, or in pairs, would be a rather rare event.  We do not know what was seen in this instance.  PD));41.8752481605352;-80.7834933110368
