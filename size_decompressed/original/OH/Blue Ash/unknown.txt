Two abnormal red lights, one pulsing, extremely loud.;2015-06-23 22:35:00;10 seconds;Two abnormal red lights, one pulsing, extremely loud. I went outside to get something out of my car and I hear an extremely loud sound with really heavy bass elements.  It sounded slightly like a helicopter, but it clearly wasn't.  It flew extremely fast and low from one horizon, over my house, and to the other horizon within 10-15 seconds.   As it got closer to me, it started to sound similar to a supersonic jet approaching the speed of sound.  I couldn't see any form to the craft, but all I could see was two red lights, one on top of the other with the top one pulsing.   Throughout the night, I saw several planes and helicopters in the sky, as usual and they looked nothing close to what I saw, which confirmed that this wasn't a normal craft.  The placing of the lights weren't normal for any craft I've ever seen and there was a complete absence of headlights.  I would actually bet this was a stealth military craft, rather than one of extraterrestrial origin.  Either way, this was clearly a UFO and absolutely abnormal.   I have the last half of the sighting on video, but at this point you can barely make it out through the trees, but you can hear it pretty well.;39.2607;-84.4111
