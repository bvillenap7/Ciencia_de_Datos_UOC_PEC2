Driving home on 11/15/2012 approximately 06:33 PM EST, my family of four witnessed a single red sphere traveling slowly below the clouds traveling S/SW. The object had a bright orange/red glow to it, very different from any small plane/helicopter that usually are in the air at night (we live very close to the now defunct Blue Ash Airport).   No sounds were emitted, we observed it for approximately 3-4 minutes before the object disappeared. No blinking lights or other signs that would indicate the object was an aircraft of some sort.;39.2607;-84.4111
