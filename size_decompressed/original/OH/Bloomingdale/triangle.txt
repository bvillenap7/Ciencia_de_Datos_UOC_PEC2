Orange Orb turned into Three Orbs.;2014-06-25 23:00:00;5 minutes;Orange Orb turned into Three Orbs I was sitting on my porch at approximately 23:00 hours and looked up in to the clear night sky at what I thought was a bright orange star flickering in the south sky.  It became apparent after I stared at it for several seconds that it was hovering and moving gently to the left and the right.  I then thought it was some type of plane or helicopter but I heard no sounds of engines from a helicopter or plane.  It also seemed so high and far away because it was the size of the stars that were out in the sky.  Within the first minute of observing it moving back and forth from east to west the orange light broke away into three orange lights then took the form of an inverted triangle, with the original orb being at the base of the inverted triangle while two other orbs formed the top corners.  It appeared as a black triangular mass that was joined at the three corners by the orange lights. It briefly expanded and contracted and moved to the right fairly quickly and then just hovered remained stationary.  I then opened the door and yelled for my husband to come quick and tell me what he sees.  He ran to the kitchen window saw where I was describing and then the three orbs seemed to contract back into the original orb and it immediately shot straight up (quickly) and the event was over.  It only lasted for approximately 4-5 minutes.  I stood and observed the sky for about another five minutes and saw and heard nothing.
