glowing object  moving like nothing I know of man made.;2005-10-07 22:55:00;1minute;glowing object  moving like nothing I know of man made. We were leaving the Lebanon Race Track main building at about 10:55 pm walking out the door nearest the main gate faceing southwest my nephew spotted something and asked whats that.  His father was the next to see it and started saying I dont know what that is but thats weird  So I tried to spot what they were looking at so traveling from left to right was a solid glowing object. It moved in a irratic way when I seen it sorta of wobbly then shot forward across the sky for a short distance then stopped suddenly.  Then it moved downward rapidly and stopped suddenly again then abruptly shot upward.   fter this it shot forward again not as far as the first time but stopped abruptly again.  After this it went forward slighting then  arcing down very steaply towards the ground and dissapeard.  I dont know if it made it to the ground because where we were we had buildings and trees in our line of sight and could not see the ground where this thing was at into the distance.  We had a clear shot of it while it was in the sky though and  personaly I have never seen anything move like this thing did.;39.4272000000001;-84.1664

I immediately took notice of an oval-oblong chrome object moving silently across a crystal clear blue sky.  No clouds in sight.  I immediately parked my car and got out and continued to watch it as it moved to the west.  As I was watching it, another object, oval-oblong chrome, seemed to 'appear' and began moving north toward Dayton.   The first object continued in its west direction.  The objects made no sound.  Then a passenger jet began approaching from the west.  It looked like a JET - no confusion. It was distinctly a passenger Jet. Curious about the sighting, I googled the search UFOs seen over Lebanon Ohio June 19, 2013.   To my surprise, a video is posted of a &quotfleet of UFO's seen over Montgomery Ohio on June 16, 2013&quot. Montgomery is about 20-30 minute drive south of Lebanon. Here is the link to that video   http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x110apl_ufo-fleet-over-montgomery-ohio-15-june-2013_tech#.UcHjvJyA_f1;39.4272000000001;-84.1664

I was driving home from a friend’s house on Sunday around 1000 in the evening when I received a call from my father.  He told me that there was a floating blinking light moving around the cornfield in his backyard.  As a skeptic, I told my father that I would come over and retrieve it.  I arrive at the house at roughly 1030 in the evening and head to the back door to meet my father. I look into the cornfield and can see an oval shaped light flickering roughly 120 meters away from us. It flashed like a strobe and was a milky white consistency. The light emanated from the center of the object and would rise from out of the corn and then lower back into the corn. I tried the best I could to come up with a logical explanation to the item but could not.  It was windy yet it would remain in place, if it been a balloon it would have popped or blown away. I decided to inspect the area. As I neared the end of our yard to the line of corn, I heard sounds that I could not ! identify. I could tell by the sound something was moving in the corn, but also some sort of weird watery chewy sound that I can’t exactly describe. Deciding not to enter the field I returned to the house. The light continued to raise and lower into the corn. I decided to flash a light on it from the house, and it receded into the corn. After a few minutes it came back out. We sat and watched it through binoculars and a night vision scope trying to figure out what it was. At around 100 in the morning, it receded into the corn and did not appear again. After 30 minutes of waiting we decided it had left and went to bed. In the morning, I decided to search the corn field for evidence with my father. My father and I are both military trained and have extensive knowledge in tracking, as well as being alert to our surroundings. There were no signs of activity. No footprints, no trash, no animal footprints, nothing. My father is an older man and the images are a bit shaky. It scare! d the dog which was inside the house, as it remained in the ba! ck of it s cage.;39.4272000000001;-84.1664
