White and orange fireball seen.;1999-11-16 19:04:00;10 seconds;White and orange fireball seen. My friend and I were in her car and witnessed a fireball with a tail flying from west to east.  The fireball was white and orange, and, from where we were, appeared to possibly have been breaking apart.  It seemed to be moving quite fast.  We only saw it for approximately 10 seconds, though we may had witnessed it longer had there not been trees above us blocking our view.  We attempted to follow it, but when we had initially seen it we were pulling up to stop sign, and by the time we could go, it was too late.  My friend and I are both amateur UFO enthusiasts, and I had come to the conclusion that what we had seen might had been a comet, but we marvelled at the size of it.  It was rather large.  Upon hearing about all the reportings of it, I thought it would be best to also report what we had seen. NUFORC Note:  We assume the witness is addressing the event that occurred that evening, and that was witnessed from Wisconsin to New York, and as far south as Tennessee.  We have entered the tinme at 1904 hrs..  PD));39.4272000000001;-84.1664
Bright blueish fireball type object in Lebanon;2011-07-26 21:30:00;2 seconds;Bright blueish fireball type object in Lebanon I was driving to the Little Ceaser's on Columbus Ave. in Lebanon, when, as I was passing Dairy queen to my right, I noticed to my left an extremely bright blue fireball type of object going down toward the horizon very quickly.  It disappeared behind the treeline.  The object looked like a huge meteor coming down very quickly, but was much too large and bright.  Very unsual.

UFO in lebanon ohio;2013-07-18 00:22:00;30-40 seconds;ufo in lebanon ohio I was on break at work on 3rd shift.  Myself and few others were sitting and smoking a cigerette.  One guy who is former air force all of said guys what is that?  As I looked along with the 3rd witness, we saw a fireball looking object in the distance.  We all thought it was a plane on fire going down.  But as soon as it showed up it hovered for a few seconds and seem to get brighter and larger then just vanished.  Completely gone.  We all thought what the hell was that.  We agreed that with in the hour we would check news and see if it was a plane crash.  It came back negative for any type of plane crashing.  The next day after talking we though night jumpers with flares.   I personally called numerous jump places to ask if they had jumped at 0022.  They all had same response and that is no one is allowed to jump after a certain time and they don't so that kind of jumping in warren county.  I still have a voicemail to prove it.  Whatever we saw, it wasn't a flare I know from being in the marines.  It wasn't a plane.  I do know I never have seen anything like it before.
