Ultra-slow totally silent low-flying huge dull black triangular body with evident 'cockpit.';1999-09-15 21:00:00;3-5 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD)) Ultra-slow totally silent low-flying huge dull black triangular body with evident 'cockpit.' We're on a flight path here for either Dayton or Cinci airports, so I often see aircraft of all sizes flying overhead, day and night. However, one evening [late summer or fall??] I saw lights over the trees that were somehow different, and then I realized something very large was blocking the night sky.  I kept listening for the sound of engines or jets, but there was total silence. The craft was huge, so large that it may have been higher than I first thought.  At the time, as it passed over [an angle of about 30 degrees to the left of right over my head] it seemed to be no more than a couple of hundred yards above treetop level. The eeriest part was the dead slow speed and total absense of any sound.  The second thing I realized was that it had headlights under where one would expect the cockpit to be [4 or 6?], but none of the FAA required 'navigation' lights on wingtips, and no strobe light. The color was generally a dull black, a bit lighter than the night sky so some shape details could be picked out and not just  the silloette.  It was a wide triangular shape, wider than our stealth bombers but not as wide as the old flying wings of the mid-40's.  It was relatively thick, with a 'cut away' portion in front where what appeared to be cockpit windows were above the 'headlights' previously mentioned. Nothing of note was seen on the bottom, no lights, no indentations, nothing but smooth dull black. Living close to Wright Patterson AFB I might expect to see experimental craft in the area, but not ultra-slow totally silent craft lacking the FAA required lighting.;39.4272000000001;-84.1664
