On July 3, 2010, 9:15 PM, I was in my back yard, between the barn and the house.  I have four bats that come out at night and was watching them eating insects.  Something caught my eye and it looked like it might be a half mile up in the sky. The object was not exactly oval shaped, but not really cigar shaped, but rather like a capsule. The back half was lit, but not with a light bulb.  The middle section was dark, and the front was identical to the back half lit, more glowing.  There was no sound, no wings, no gondola, and it appeared to be moving as if by equipment, and not the wind. I watched for approximately 4 minutes.  This object was going from approximately north to south. It disappeared by just going away in the distance. Also, it the light was not brought on by the sunset, as the sun was already down for the night. To give an estimate of how large this object may have been if on the ground it is hard to say, but my estimate would probably be in the 25-30 feet range, the height maybe 8 feet or so.  My neighbor asked me, when I told him of this, wanted to know if there were any smaller lights on it, such as what airplanes use, and there were not.;39.8631999999999;-82.6269000000001
