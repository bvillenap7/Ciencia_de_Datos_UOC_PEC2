Seen ghostly cloud formation that I assumed was northern lights.  Cloud stretched across northern horizon about 30 degrees (of 90) directly due north in the northern quadrant of sky.  It reminded me of a jellyfish with wispy cloud-like tendrils hanging down from it.  The main body of the cloud did not appear to move itself but the tendrils hanging beneath appeared to shift about and move slowly as if they were suspended in flowing water.  I remark that as I witnessed it I noticed that I could hear dogs barking for miles around within the silence of the rural setting.  I have since checked space weather and there were no aurora forecast.;39.3526;-83.3887999999999
