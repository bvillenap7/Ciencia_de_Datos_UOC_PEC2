Boomerang ,points upright, in Greenfield, Ohio;2008-10-20 18:30:00;15 minutes;Boomerang ,points upright, in Greenfield, Ohio I saw this thing this evening, the sun had gone behind the horizon, yet there were no stars showing in the sky yet, it was still like daylight, there were very few scattered clouds, but the sky was very clear above and below these few clouds, with a very light breeze.   I had gone to mailbox,( I have to drive, it is a half mile lane), on my way back I saw what looked, at first to be something dropping from the sky,slowly, or far away, and appeared slowly.  Then I thought it was something like a meteor, all within seconds, then realized it was nothing like what I thought, because it was moving to slow for that, so I hurried up the driveway, ran into house to grab my camera, and binoculars, and my camera batteries were gone, so I looked with binoculars, and saw something that looked like a boomerang, or tuning fork, since it was in a shape of, well , as if the fork was upright with the points in the air, or a boomerang, moving away from me, with points in the air, or sideways, if you will.  I then ran into the house to get new batteries for my camera, and returned to see, but it was getting lower in the sky, and so had to go further out to the pasture, and I snapped a picture of it, but it was pretty far away by then. I did get it on camera. I told my husband (as I ran in and out of the house to look and try and get a picture). He did not witness it, as he is a bed-bound parapalegic.  He is a Navy Veteran and said it was moving toward WrightPatt. Thank-you;39.3526;-83.3887999999999
