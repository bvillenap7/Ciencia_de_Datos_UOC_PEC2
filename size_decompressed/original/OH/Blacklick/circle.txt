A white/red flashing circular object flying on a highly irregular trajectory.;2014-07-04 22:30:00;30 minutes;A white/red flashing circular object flying on a highly irregular trajectory. About 10:30pm EST I saw a white/red light flashing flying in a very irregular pattern.  It fly straight, veer from side to side, stop completely, and then resume flying (as described).  It didn't appear to have any problems with acceleration.   After stopping dead in its tracks, it would resume it's previous speed, without the need to accelerate and gradually maintain momentum.  I followed it's trajectory (north east) until I lost sight of it. About 10 minutes later, I searched the sky in the direction I had last seen it.  I saw a white/red flashing object, that appeared to be circling one area small area of the sky.  Again, it would stop suddenly, and continue circling without needing to gradually accelerate.  Unclear if it is the same object from earlier.;40.0207;-82.8114999999998
Bright circle in sky standing still.;2015-08-29 06:00:00;>40 minutes;Bright circle in sky standing still. It was between 6:00 and 6:30 AM.  I was looking out my window having coffee, and i saw outside of my house, up in the sky a perfect circle, bright (white maybe silver-ish), but VERY bright.  It stood still, no movement, no lights flashing,no noise.  I watched clouds come and pass infront of it, I would look away for only seconds, and when i look back, it would be in a new spot, just an inch or two away from where it started.   I never saw it moving WHILE looking at it directly.  The fact that it was not moving, was what made me wonder...what the heck is it??  It was so bright, that i could look at the sky and see it without trying hard to look for it.  there was no other objects in the sky around it, except for clouds passing through.  it was blue sky.   After i sat here for 40 minutes, maybe longer watching it, a big group of clouds passed infront of it, took them a little while to move out of the way, but when they finally did, the thing was no longer in my sight, it was gone.;40.0207;-82.8114999999998
Bright lights moving in unison.;2018-08-20 21:36:00;1 minutes;Bright lights moving in unison. Six bright lights noted in the sky in the shape of a L.  They moved in sync and ducked behind storm clouds.  These lights were unlike anything I have seen previously.  They were a deep orange and were not blinking as a plane would.;40.0207;-82.8114999999998
