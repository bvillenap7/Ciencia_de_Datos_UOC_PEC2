White/orange lights traveling the same direction and faded at the same spot.;2014-09-27 21:30:00;5-10 minutes;White/orange lights traveling the same direction and faded at the same spot. My neighbor and I saw four lights traveling in a single line coming from the north heading west over or around the Columbus airport, no sound, not blinking.  The lights were about 1 to 3 minutes apart and all faded out when they reached the same spot.  The sky was clear, no clouds.  About 2 months ago witness the same thing, but only one object this time.;40.0207;-82.8114999999998
