I turned to the left and looked up and saw a bright soft orange sphere in the sky.  I said that's an unusual star because the other stars were smaller and definitely not orange.  I noticed that it was pulsating in and out!  I pulled out my cell phone a took video footage.  I was amazed to see an disc or bell shape object pulsating and with something like a steak of light or beam coming from it!  The most amazing thing to me was that it when I looked at that object with the naked eye it was an orange ball of light but when I look through my phone lens it was white and definitely not a plane, star, helicopter etc.  In fact several planes passed near it and that sphere was 10 times the size of the planes!  The planes looked like ants compared to the size of this ufo.   I have been looking at the video in aww! I've always wondered about and heard of these experiences. Now that I've experienced this for ! myself I no we are not alone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));40.0207;-82.8114999999998
