My son and I were sitting on our back patio looking at the sky when we saw a disk shaped oblect come into view in the sky.  The object circled back and forth a few times and then completely dissapeared.  Immediately after disappearing, a black streak which looked like smoke from a damaged flying object appeared in the sky.  As the streak came down to earth, a military/navy airship appeared coming in very high up and very fast towards the black streak that was coming towards earth.  This happened in the western sky last night.;40.0207;-82.8114999999998
