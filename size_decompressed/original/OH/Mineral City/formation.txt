The right time and the right place,very lucky.;2006-10-15 23:00:00;1 minute;The right time and the right place, very lucky. I'm an astronomy enthusiast, therefore I always study the stars.   Arriving home late after the afternoon shift I spotted this V-formation of lights moving from west to east slowly.  No sound was heard.   If this was a single craft in outer space, it would have to have been enormous.  I know what satellites look like and they don't travel in V-formation.   I'm very pleased to have witnessed this once in a lifetime event. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
