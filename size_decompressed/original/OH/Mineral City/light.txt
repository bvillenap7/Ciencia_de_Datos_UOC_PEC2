I was admiring the clear sky while lighting a cigarette when I noticed a star moving fairly quickly but not quick enough to be a shooting star, which I see often. I watched it for 30 seconds moving from West to East.  Then it just disappeared. I just assumed it was an airplane or jet, etc.  But just then a plane passed over. It was moving from South-West to North-East.  It was much slower I followed it in the sky for upwards of five minutes. I also noticed the noticed that accompanied the plane, like air wake.  The UFO had no noise. The plane also just continued out of view beyond the roof top.  Whereas the UFO just was gone in the blink of an eye.  I then realized what I had seen was a UFO and immediately told my father who told me to report it… While laughing at me…;40.5725;-81.3469
