Rapid glittering white lights.;2021-03-17 23:15:00;5 minutes;Rapid glittering white lights. While getting ready to go to bed, I looked out the bedroom window to the north and asked my wife if she saw the same lights in the sky as I could. She did, and asked what it was. The lights were rapidly glittering back and forth. Traveling above the clouds, it was wider than a normal aircraft. Flying south to north east of Mansfield. I called for our sons to come see it as well. Our youngest son tried to get it on video, but he couldn't focus on it with his photo. The craft did not make any sound. It was not a satellite, it was not the space station, or comet, or meteor. I have star gazed for years and know what normal aircraft, and celestial objects are at night. The pattern of the lights did not match any that I have seen in 40+ years of watching the sky. They were bright white and did not follow the on/off pattern but, it was random, rapid, back and forth.;40.7542120370369;-82.5355211279451
