Ball of light enters van, in Richland county,Ohio;1988-09-20 22:50:00;15-20minutes;Ball of light enters van, in Richland county,Ohio I am a retired decorate Police Sergeant, I hold an Associate, Bachelor of Science and Masters Degrees in Criminal Justice Administration. During September of 1988, my ex-wife and I were driving from a police training school.I was driving my Ford Econoline conversion van E/B on State route 30 just outside of Mansfield,Ohio. The event occurred as follows.  I was driving and my ex-wife asked me the time. I looked at the clock in the dash and told her.The time was about 15 - 10 minutes till 11 PM.At that moment there was a brilliant, white light flash. It was so bright that it filled the entire windshield.I yelled What the hell was that?!! My ex-wife immediately started screaming. I looked at her and saw what appeared to be a blue/white ball of light floating in midair between the dash and her seat. The ball of light silently went to the right, and it disolved through the door panel. We were both stunned!! It reappeared in an instant and resummed its same position. As the ex-wife screamed the ball of light reacted to her screams.The ball of light rapidly moved back and forth, as if it were on a track.I stared at the ball of light and saw that it was actually comprised of a large grapefruit size sphere of light. This sphere was orbited at its equator by at least (6) six smaller balls of light. This ball of light, did as the first sphere did, it moved to and through the closed door panel on the passenger's side of the van. This whole event took a matter of seconds to occur, yet, between 15 and 330,30 minutes had passed!1 I NEVER STOPPED DRIVING THE VAN!!! I NEVER PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROADWAY. I have no explanation of what this was or what occured during the missing time. I can only report what occurred. My ex-wife did a drawing of the balls of light when we got back to her apartment in Canton. I have not seen her for a number of years, I don't know where she is or whatever happened to the drawing.

Pewter spheres over interstate;1998-12-21 06:30:00;30 seconds;pewter spheres over interstate This is an old report but I’ve never told anyone but family.  It was back in December 1998. I was driving home from business training in Dallas.  I was between Cincinnati and Cleveland on the interstate driving north.  It was dawn and I had been driving since the previous afternoon so I was pretty tired to say the least.  It was a clear morning and the sky was  just turning blue.  There were very few cars on the highway.   I rolled down the window to get some cold air on my face to wake me up.  I leaned my head out and after a few seconds I tilted my head back to get some wind on my neck.  At about a 75 to 80 degree angle  above me a pewter colored sphere just dropped into my view way up at the edge of the atmosphere.  It paused for a split second then zipped toward the west so fast that my eyes didn’t even try to follow it.   A second later another one dropped into view and followed the first one, then a third and then a forth.   I rapidly braked and pulled onto the shoulder without taking my eyes off of the spot where they had appeared.  I got out and watched for several minutes but nothing else happened.   When I say sphere, I could only see the bottom of the….what ever they were so from my perspective I could almost imagine them as being a ball shaped.   They moved so fast to the west that getting a profile perspective as they moved off was impossible. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Two small flying steel spheres;2007-09-05 12:00:00;60 seconds;Two small flying steel spheres Subject: 2 small round UFO’s sighted  When:  near end of summer & start of fall 2007  Where:  Mansfield, Ohio  While sitting with my cat at N.W. corner of house, I looked up to notice a “swarm” of dragonflies all around a “ball” floating above that corner of the house.  I moved slightly to block the sun’s glare with the gutter, and had a clear view from 8’ to 10’ away of what looked like a metal ball - solid, perfectly round & smooth and the size of a baseball.  It started moving slowly to my left with the dragonflies moving with it.  I tried to rationalize what I am seeing as a bubble or seed pod - but it was not a fuzzy outline - but a solid perfectly round ball.  I looked around for anything else in the sky, but don’t see anything.  Continuing to watch the object, a 2nd ball - identical to the first  (but with no dragonflies) moved slowly into view on the same track and height reducing the distance between the two until just above me - then it went straight up vertical from horizontal at a right angle increasing speed slightly (maybe x 2) as the first object continued on same track & height.  I was astonished that I had seen something that shouldn’t be there.  Since I had observed this for maybe a full minute and so close, I didn’t run to the front of the house to get another look as I had already seen it very clearly and didn’t really want to draw attention to myself.
