We headed home and as I pulled out my cell to capture it on video it disappeared into the clouds.;40.7542120370369;-82.5355211279451
A circular flashing craft was seen over the south Mansfield area.;2013-06-08 01:15:00;20+ minutes;A circular flashing craft was seen over the south Mansfield area. As I was driving home late last night after picking up family in Willard, I thought I saw lightening on the left side of 13 South between the Cook Rd. exit and Straub Rd.  I then noticed it was flashing at a consistent rate of about one second.  My mother, 2 children of 11 years, and I saw this most of the way towards the I 71 exchange. I decided to take 71 north to figure out what was going on since I had never seen anything like this before.  Going north we could see that it was stationary, in the air and not one of the airplane towers, which had red lights and were lower down. At the 39 exit, I turned around and headed south.  We were better able to see the light source. It was wide, round and not very tall in comparison to its width.  The lights went around in a counter-clockwise manner, so that it looked to be flashing.  The lights were white with a slight blueish tint, which is why I mistook it for lightening.  It was several miles east of 71 and too low and stationary for a plane, but too high to be something from the ground. I don't know what it was, but was a bit freaked out because I had never seen anything like it. The children couldn't sleep for hours afterwards because they were freaked out as well.;40.7542120370369;-82.5355211279451
