At first I stared trying to figure out if it was on a pole or something because it wasn't moving. once I saw it wasn't I yelled to him to look it's a ufo.  He looked and freaked out like I did.  Right after he looked it flew away and higher and we watched it for about five minutes so high up it looked like an airplane minus the blinking. It went really far really fast.;40.7542120370369;-82.5355211279451

I was looking at the clouds as they were moving from the NE to the SW.  I saw a green triangle cross my line of sight for approximately 3 seconds, traveling from the East to the West.  I did not hear a sound.  It was traveling at a high rate of speed, in a straight line.  It was a bright emerald green color, with circles of light (the same green color) on each point of the triangle.  It was not an isosceles triangle, but an elongated one.  I am a 56 year old college graduate, who has been clean and sober for over 30 years.  I know very little about UFO's, nor have I ever actively looked for them.  I am just reporting what I saw, in the hopes that someone else saw something similar tonight.;40.7542120370369;-82.5355211279451
