Pure white oval shaped image moving slowly. Major axis was several full moon widths long. Minor axis about half of major. No colors or ;1973-09-20 10:00:00;3 - 6 seconds;((NUFORC Note:  Date and time indicated are a gross estimate.  PD)) Pure white oval shaped image moving slowly. Major axis was several full moon widths long. Minor axis about half of major. No colors or marks. Early to mid AM. This report is in response to the 9/20/73 incident in Mansfield , Ohio which was reported January 1999. I have just now read this and am compelled to send in the account of my observation , which is remarkable only in that it occurred one mile NW from the location of the 9/20/73 incident. Regrettably, I can only narrow the date to between 1972 and 1974, though it did occur during the regular school year. I was a pupil of the Woodland Elementary school at the time. It was early to mid morning with clear skies. I was leaning with my back against a SW wall looking south when I looked up. I do not know why I looked up, but when I did I immediately saw an oval image directly overhead moving slowly from west to east. It was pure white with a slight homogenous glow over its shape.  The major axis of the oval was several full moon widths long and the minor axis was about half of the major. The edges were slightly  fuzzy due to the glow. The image had no colors or marks and I did not hear any sound from it. The lack of markings or sharp edges prevented me from judging it’s altitude, but I did have the impression that it was low, maybe tree top level.  I observed this for three to six seconds until it passed out of view behind the school roof. I paused for just enough seconds to say to myself, “what in the...?”, then ran away from the building expecting to see it again. If it had maintained it’s velocity, I would have definitely seen it in the clear sky, but it was gone. Other kids were outside, but none were looking up. I wish I could provide a more accurate date, but I do not even recall what season it was. I am fairly sure of the year range, so there is a chance that it may have been 9/20/73.;40.7542120370369;-82.5355211279451
Bright orange oval object hovering and then streaking across the sky.;2013-07-13 23:00:00;45 seconds;Bright orange oval object hovering and then streaking across the sky. I was talking to my mother on her porch when we both caught a glimpse of bright orange light over the tree tops.  An orange oval shaped object stood still in the sky for just a few seconds, and then zipped away at a high rate of speed, changing appearance to look like a flaming streak.   It grew smaller as the seconds ticked by and then simply blinked out.  It reappeared standing still and oval shaped again but smaller.   It blinked out again only to vanish.

Very bright, reflective, gold, oval object low in the night sky.;2014-01-05 02:22:00;3 minutes;Very bright, reflective,gold, oval object low in the night sky At 2:22 AM on January 5, 2014 and Un-identified object hovered in the night sky in the south end of Mansfield, Ohio, close to Rt. 13 & I71.  The object was oval shaped, very bright and reflective. It appeared to be of a gold hue and did not move.  It had lines or slashes in the exterior going from the top right to the bottom left.  It hung very low in the sky. I have lived in this area many years.  I let my dog out at night and consistently take note of my surrounding, as there are coyotes known to attack.  I also watch constellations and weather nightly and never has this object been seen by me or anyone that I am aware of in the neighborhood. I viewed it from different windows facing South and South/East.  As easily as it was seen it also disappeared, much like shutting off a light it did not take off or whisk away. There was snow accumulation on the ground the temperature was in the low 20’s.  There was no precipitation.  A frigid record cold setting forecast is predicted in less than 24 hours.;40.7542120370369;-82.5355211279451
