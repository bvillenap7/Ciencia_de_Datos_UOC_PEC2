Saw fireball in the sky while delivering papers one morning.;2011-06-15 03:00:00;10 minutes;Saw fireball in the sky while delivering papers one morning. I and my girlfriend were delivering newspapers in a rural part of Richland County.  We came to the end of one of the roads of delivery and turned left on the next road of delivery.   We drove to the first house to the left.  I happened to catch a glance of what I thought was the moon at first to the east of my vehicle,  but the object was too small to be the moon.  It was orange and about the size of a quarter held at arm's length and moving side to side.   I tried to track the object, but when I reached the road the object could not be located.   I tried to think of any cause that would explain this we do have a National Guard airport to the west of this, but even this does not explain what we saw.   I don't remember the day or month, except it was warm. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));40.7542120370369;-82.5355211279451

I glanced at the night sky and a round, red, ball of flame darted across the sky in a slightly erratic pattern.   The object was below the cloud deck and moved at a very high rate of speed toward the northeast sky.   The object was in view approximately 4 seconds.;40.7542120370369;-82.5355211279451

2 of 2 - Fireball entering earths, slowed down and accelerated out of earths atmosphere;2019-09-27 01:30:00;7 seconds;2 of 2 - Fireball entering earths, slowed down and accelerated out of earths atmosphere Sighting 2 of 2 On September 27th, my wife and traveled to the back side of Charles Mill Reservoir, just outside of Mansfield, Ohio.  The location we choose is void of light with very little light pollution from the city, perfect for stargazing and watching out for shooting stars.  What would be a routine sky watching evening would turn anything but.  At approximately 1:30 both my wife and I witnessed what we would both classify as the exact same event as described on July 27th, post 1 of 2. We saw what we thought was a shooting star entering the Earthâ€™s atmosphere from the northeast at 30-40 degrees above the horizon on a bearing of 210.  Just as we thought the object was about to flame out it immediately slowed down to the speed of a commercial jetliner and the brightness of a normal star.  After approximately 5-6 seconds it accelerated to the same speed as it had entered the atmosphere and the same brightness.  Needless-to-say, we were both left speechless. As a former pilot I have never seen an incident which left me wondering what it was I just saw.  Whether or not this was military or something not from this Earth, I do not know.  But what I do know, is what I saw.  I not only saw it once, I have seen it twice.  During both incidents, there was no alcohol involved as neither of us drink.  We are both sound of mind and these are the first two incidents we have ever reported.  I will state again, I know what I saw and it could not in any way shape or form be mistaken for something else.;40.7542120370369;-82.5355211279451
