The clouds were dark grey, red, yellow, and had lightning in front of it but it didn't move like clouds, as a matter of fact it was moving faster than normal clouds, I looked up and I saw a chem trail then this egg shaped craft,  I thought what the hell?  There was a train conductor in an Engine moving in the opposite direction and he had to see it cause I saw him looking too.   I know believe in UFO's this craft was not from here.
