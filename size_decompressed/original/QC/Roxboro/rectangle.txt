What got my attention was a pulsing flame which was coming out of the bottom of this black rectangular shaped object and moved up and down as flame went from big too small. AS this object glided overhead I could hear a light humming sound as it tilted over to its belly. It was the size of a medium bus and maybe a little bigger considering the height it was at. It came from the west and headed east as it gained altitude and just disappeared into the blue sky. Could this be the black knight satellite?;45.5111;-73.7978
