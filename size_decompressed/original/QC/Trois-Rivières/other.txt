A  quiet vessel flying over  the University of Trois-Rivieres,Quebec;1991-03-30 19:00:00;12 seconds;A  quiet vessel flying over  the University of Trois-Rivieres,Quebec It had the shape of a bell with a light coming out from the inside just like a commun lampshade. It was flying in a slow motion and it appeared very big from where I was. I realized that was nothing like I was used to see, for it was flying silently, no noise was to be heard. At that very moment, I was walking my way to the university bringing coffees in my hands to my department with another pal walking with me. I said to him: Look! There! In the sky! He said: where? But he hadn't had the time to see it for the  thing  flew through the air and vanished into the clouds making a curved motion.I had never seen nothing like this before. When I went back to the department,I was shocked livid. I realized that I saw stg. unusual. I felt both weak and strong. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.
