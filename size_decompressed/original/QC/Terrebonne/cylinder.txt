Bite me if i am wrong, but that was a UFO for sure.;2004-03-30 23:15:00;20 secondes;The ufa was flying at about 10000 feets and was going very fast, then it stop for maybe 5 secondes and change direction very fast 2 times before going up vertically and disapeared in a flash (in 5 secondes it completely Vanished) when that appened, i knew that it was NOT normal planes, cheez Normal plane on earth couldn't change direction drastically like that on an angle of over 70 Degrees 2 times and disapear so fast.  I am still in shock of having witness this event, its in these moments that you think and rethink about it and think you are crazy or that you really saw something that is not possible, but can be since it would be stupid to think we are alone in the universe.  so bite me if i am wrong, but that was a UFO for sure.  -((name deleted));45.7225571428571;-73.6653423076923
