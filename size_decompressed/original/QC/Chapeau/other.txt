One did come into the tent and I got to see it very close up (approx. 1 foot away from my face.).  Completely the most unexplainable event of my life. This happened on the ground, not in space.  They were more like just abnormal lifeforms of some kind- not space crafts.  Approximately 6 sphere-shaped lights around the size of softballs.  The lights were different colours- 1 blue, 1 orange/red, 2 white, 2 yellow.  The spheres of light would appear and then dissapear (flashing-like).  I was very close to one of them and the light did not dissapear to any source, it was there and then would be gone after its flash.  At times they would flash as fast as a fast strobe light.  They also moved around as they flashed.  The best thing I could compare them to is glow bugs, except much brighter, much more faster flashing at times, and no source of light. If you have heard anything like this before or if you have any kind of information that you could tell me about this, please email me and let me know. If you would like me to go into the details more I will do that too.;45.9146;-77.0706
