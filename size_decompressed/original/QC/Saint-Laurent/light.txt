HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Round, when lit, it looked oblong when all lights were out.;2004-04-10 23:00:00;approx: 5 minutes;Round, when lit, it looked oblong when all lights were out . Full Description of event/sighting: I was typing on my computer, when I looked out the window I saw a bright red light in the sky approx. 10 cm in diameter, flying on a low horizon at a distance of maybe a couple of blocks away from my place.  It was really bright. At first I thought I was seeing things, then I called my father. As soon as my father came to see, the object made a sharp right turn and then the light dimmed out.  Then maybe 5 minutes later I saw it again, a really bright red circle. This time it seemed it like it was climbing. This time my father did see it....and saw how quick it was gaining in altitude without actually covering any horizontal distance. As it went up in the sky the lights once again turned off....bizarre, If it was a plane flying at night wouldn't it have headlights on....I'm used to planes flying over me, being close to the airport. But this was not the same......both my dad and I decided to check it out further and we went outside to look at it and we could see all the lights were off, but you could still see that greyish oblong shaped object in the sky....it seemed like it was going around in circles around our neighborhood. I don't know what this was. I was hoping that someone could shed some light on this.  Thank you to the witness for the report.
