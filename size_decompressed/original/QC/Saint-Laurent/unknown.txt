Quick flying object in the night of the pink moon.;2020-04-04 10:55:00;3 minutes;Quick flying object in the night of the pink moon Steped outside to take a look at the pink moon.  I started looking at this star that was on the opposite direction of the moon . Straight across . While looking in the oppsite direct of the moon , I noticed this object gliding through the sky . It was not bright . It had no lights . I thought it could be a bird but I did not any such wings .It must have been a large object since I could see it so clear through the sky .I coud say I can not make out weither it was a cylinder shape or disk . I believe the best color to describe what I saw tonight would be Brown/gold .I tried to get a video but the object or thing gliding through  was way to high in the sky and also blending in the dark . I dont think it was a plane because I saw a plane that passed already at 10:52 pm . I did not hear any noises . I live in a very populated area . This is why I figured oh wow look a bird in the night but I really could not see wings flapping.;45.5031891472868;-73.7066899224806
