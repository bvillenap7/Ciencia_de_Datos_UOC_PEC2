weekend- PHOTOS OBTAINED;2001-08-04 01:00:00;30 minutes;weekend- PHOTOS OBTAINED ((NUFORC Note:  We note that the sighting is not inconsistent with that of a celestial body, but that is only a guess.  Twinkling stars are described to us precisely as the witness here has described the sighting.  Without the application of triangulation, it cannot be known how far away from the witness the object of interest was.  PD)) I originally filed this report on the filers files site but have not heard back. I wlill therefore briefly explain the event please contact the filerfiles for the original report as this was a definate ufo sighting and i have photographs of the event. It lasted for at least 30 minutes while it hovered and manged to get about 4 or 5 photos weith a Canon 35 mm camera sporting a 200 mm zoom lens. it happened at  early A.M. i got up for a drink of water and noticed an extremely bright star blinking in the sky which caught my eye from my kitchen patio so i went onto the balcony to observe it and there it was, a diamond shape craft-star sitting in the sky hovering for over 30 minutes probably as long as an hour. It was brilliant white, flickered somewhat and with the naked eye colors could be seen either rotating around the top or alternating flash sequences....green and red. I of course then watched it with the 200 mm zoom lens and called for my fiance ( an ardent skeptic) and watched through the zoom lens. It had a red and green revoloving light on top or near the top it emitted a bluish beam at various times and even released another smaller diamond shaped light from the side which travelled away from it. Neighbours were also out watching because i could hear them talking aand wondering what it was and of course my flash going off at 1:30 a.m as i took photos attracted attention. it just sat there really high almost like a star for over 30 minutes. A commercial aircraft i think flew by at one point in the general vicinity, it didn't seem to veer off or even notice the object, i think it may have been too high. My fiance agrees with the following....it was not an aircraft helicopter or any other aircraft it was not a star it definately rotated colors red and green it emitted a blue beam and hovered in spot for an extende period of time. My fiance thinks it was the international space station but only because if it wasn't it doesn't leave much alternative. I know it wasn't, i've seen the space station in ythe sky from mexico and i watched this object with the zoom lens I will let you know how the ophotos turn out or contact me and i will send them to you. the film is not developped yet it was -is kodak max. 400 asa. again i filed a report within the next 2 days on filer files so you could always retrieve the original report. The weather by the way was clear with great visibility. Regards, ((name and credentials deleted));45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896

Downtown--seen something going super fast and high in the sky, a lot of lights flashing.;2013-11-11 02:25:00;3 minutes;@ 2h25min Montreal downtown, seen something going super fast and high in the sky, a lot of lights flashing. At first it went in a straight line, pretty fast (like a helium balloon), it had lights (orange-firey colour)  on the front part, flashing one after the other.   After a couple of seconds goings straight up, it starting turning left in the sky, until we lost sight of it. At that point, it had only 2 lights open that flashed.  It was about 3 times smaller than a plane, it had a diamond-like shape and the middle of it was like made of glass, almost translucend or with a lower type of light.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
