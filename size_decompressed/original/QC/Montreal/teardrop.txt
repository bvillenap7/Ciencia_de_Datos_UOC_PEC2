All stopped. shapes resembled teardtrops with a flat bottom. All were an opaque white. From my point of view, all objects moved to the left of my of my vantage point at a gerat speed.  All stopped at once and travelled right in as one  keeping the same distance between each light returning to the loction in which the first corse correction was made. The lights then changed formation revieling only five objects.  Renaimed stationary for a few seconds and accelerated toward the south-west and diisapeared beyond the hoizon.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
White triangles flying in sync;2010-10-28 07:25:00;2 - 3 minutes;White triangles flying in sync It was a clear morning with a few small thin clouds and a pale blue sky. The half moon was still visible and it glowed a bright white. My son and I walked to the end of our street at the school bus stop, waiting for his bus. Then he said to me, ‘What ‘s that’ ? I looked up and saw a commercial aircraft. We live by the main international airport. I said that it was a plane. He then said ‘Not that, what are those 2 white things’ ?  I looked up to see two bright white teardrop / triangle shapes - like an iron,  moving parallel to one another. They were moving so perfectly in sync and very very slowly. Here and there I could see some red on the upper surface. They flew over the clouds at times so I could tell that they were pretty high. I thought they might be helicopters but there was not a sound and no wings ! Just a body and total silence. I did not see any lights but the body itself was like it was itself lit.  As they moved away, against the direction of the airport, from North they turned South and Westward, away from the airport. They seemed to go even slower, but always in perfect sync, amd always the same distance from each other.  They got smaller and smaller, and I had to hurry back to the house after my son left in his bus, so I didn’t trail them after that. It was a strange feeling and looked and moved like nothing I've ever seen.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
