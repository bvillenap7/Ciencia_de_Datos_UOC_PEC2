falling object from the sky report please explain;2000-12-26 18:00:00;10 -20 second;falling object from the sky report please explain On our way to my girlfriend's house for dinner,the day after Christmas, it was dark outside but clear sky, as we were parking the car in front of the house we noticed at first, it looked like the light of a fast air plane and then it became a ball of fire going across the sky. It sure was the first time ever we experienced such a thing.  I thought it would be in the news at night but nothing was reported... Since I am very curious to find out if it was not a piece of the station in orbit that fell or else... Please clear this matter for me... An e-mail response only would be appreciated and confidentiality is demanded Thank you.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
UFO followed by intense green flame sighted flying over residential area of Montreal, Quebec.;2001-03-27 02:20:00;1 second;UFO followed by intense green flame sighted flying over residential area of Montreal, Quebec. At 2:20am, as I was watching TV (Jay Leno), I saw something fly right over mine and my neighbor's houses at quite a speed.  I couldn't tell what the object itself was, but whatever it was, it had a bright, intense, GREEN flame following it.  There was abosolutely no noise, it didn't crash anywhere, so it must have just kept on going beyond my sight.  The sky was clear, and nothing I've ever seen fly through the sky has ever looked like that under any circumstances.  I contacted the local airport control tower to double check their radars, but they didn't return any information on the subject.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
3 controlled fireballs in the sky;2001-08-25 19:00:00;10 minutes;3 controlled fireballs in the sky My wife and I came back home after a supper with my Mom. It was about 7PM and a very clear evening. Getting out of the parked car I noticed 3 fireballs in the sky. They seemed about as big as a car. What amazed me about these fireballs was their control.  They were putting on a show it seemed.  They took off in three different directions, then two of them came back in an arc and passed each other head on. I called out my neighbor, a bell telephone engineer, ('m an Industrial Engineer) to watch, or witness. He was as amazed as I was. The fireballs then took off together and went at an angle that they disappeared into the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Ordinarily, with this type of report, we would first ask whether the witness might have been observing advertising lights playing in the sky.  However, if the witness is an industrial engineer, we presume he would have been able to rule out such a possibility immediately.  PD));45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
bluish white fireball observed during 3-5 sec. on SW to NE trajectory over Montreal --possible sat reentry;2007-08-15 22:40:00;3-5 sec.;bluish white fireball observed during 3-5 sec. on SW to NE trajectory over Montreal --possible sat reentry The fireball suddenly appeared over the Montreal Skylight in the North West and quickly disappeared (after three seconds or so). The color was a slightly cool white (bluish) and no trail was observed. To provide a scale, an airliner was coming in on a TWENTY_FOUR RIGHT approach at Trudeau International and the fireball seemed higher yet larger than the aircraft flying at 1500 2000 AGL.  In the car, we switched a scanner radio to 119.9 the Montreal Tower frequency but no relevant comment could be heard from any of the many aircrafts on frequency at that time. Impression was we witnessed the reentry of a man made space object or a meteor.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
Bright red light flying across night sky at very fast speed in west Montreal.;2012-07-08 21:24:00;about 10 seconds;Bright red light flying across night sky at very fast speed in west Montreal. It was exactly 21:24 (after sunset) and I was outside with a friend. He then randomly pointed out a flash of red light quickly fading away, but I had the time to quickly take out my phone and take a picture (which came out terrible and you can barely see a thing :( ).  We could see an airplane nearby and there was quite a difference.  The UFO had a bright red light and was very fast, seeing that it faded away unbelievably quickly.  It was spotted in west Montreal.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
A changing shape light has been seen in a night sky for a minute.;2014-08-27 20:12:00;1 minute;A changing shape light has been seen in a night sky for a minute First, I’m a French Canadian, so my English is kind of limited.   On the night of August 27th, 2014, I went to see my friend, who lives in Ahuntsic (Montréal). It’s near the Dorval Airport, so we always see things in the sky, but this time, I was alone and I saw a little light in the sky who has changed in a bigger shape, but the shape wasn’t squared.  The form change (I took a picture).   It’s the second time I see something in the sky, but the first one wasn’t like this.  I didn’t report it cause up to day, I’m not quite sure it’s was a UFO.  But this time, it was pretty unsual.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
Bright white light moving at extreme speeds;2020-09-22 19:10:00;3 seconds;Bright white light moving at extreme speeds Bright white light, came down from the sky on a 45 degree angle for about 2 seconds very fast, about 20,000 feet, then disappeared from the tree coverage, then shot back up into the sky on a 90 degree angle and gone in about one second, was a cloudless night.  Moved very fast across the sky, about 5 to 10 miles in 2 seconds, then right up into the sky at extreme speeds, and lost sight after about one second.  View was from Montreal South West area, but looked like it could have travelled over a part of Laval (North of Montreal ). Had no time to record, as happened to fast.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
