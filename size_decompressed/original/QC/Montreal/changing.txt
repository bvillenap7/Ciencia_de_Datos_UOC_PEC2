Fluctuating light in the sky;2003-09-25 00:00:00;5 min;Fluctuating light in the sky I was at a bus stop with my friend. It was very dark as we were in an industrial area, not many street lights so we found it a little weird that the ally across the street was glowing. we went a little closer to investigate. We heard a noise that sounded like the bus so we turned around to see if it was coming. when we turned back to the ally the light was gone. We were a little spooked but didn't really think that much about it. About 2 min later we saw a light hovering about 75 feet above the building where we saw the glowing. It seemed to get larger and then smaller. It continued doing this for about 1 minute. I got large one more time and then vanished. I did not look like it took off anywhere, it was more like it went out like a candle.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896

Black rotating cross witnessed by 6 people above Tufts University Campus.;2007-06-23 20:30:00;2-3 minutes;Black rotating cross witnessed by 6 people above Tufts University Campus. All 6 of us (adults age 28 - 55) were talking a walk on Tufts University Campus on Saturday evening June 23. Around 8:30 pm, we stopped at the belvedere near the Central Heating Plant to look at the Boston skyline. As we were watching a Lufthansa Airbus 340 climbing out of Logan to the North of us, we all noticed almost overhead a peculiar black object that at first looked like a delta wing aircraft, with no lights and silent. It was going from West to East at an altitude of no more than 2,000 feet (It flew under the broken cloud cover). I estimate speed at perhaps 100 MPH. As it passed overhead the object appeared to be changing shape into a cross and rotating around its center. It was the size of a quarter held at arms'lenght. After 2-3 minutes of watching it, we lost it from view in the darker eastern sky.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
Strange shapeshifting cloud like UFO.;2010-07-10 13:30:00;10-15 Seconds;Strange shapeshifting cloud like UFO. Last July, my cousin and I were sitting on my back porch.  It was a nice day with blue skies and white cumulus clouds, no wind.  We were just chatting when for some reason I decided to look up. I saw what looked like a cloud but it was moving  pretty fast.   As I watched it started to change shape, but kept it's cloud like form.  I asked my cousin what is that?.  She looked up  and we watched it for what seemed like 10 to 15 seconds, all the while it kept changing it's form.   Eventually it just seemed to whisp away or just turned invisible right before it would have disappeared behind the branches of my tree had it stayed in view.  The direction it was coming from was East flying West.  It was quite hard to say how high it was in the sky, but I guess it to be anywhere between 150-300 feet in the air.  It didn't make any noise and it was traveling about 60-80 kilometers per hour.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
Two morphing golden shapes flying over Montreal in the evening on July 13th, 2011.;2011-07-13 20:10:00;5 minutes;Two morphing golden shapes flying over Montreal in the evening on July 13th, 2011. I was eating dinner in my kitchen, my room-mate and good friend of 20 years was drinking a beer on the balcony just five feet away from me with the door open.  He suddenly called out to me: You'd better come out here quick, quick, what are those things flying in the sky?  I ran out onto the balcony, (we're on the third and top floor of an old brownstone type building with clear views over towards Mount-Royal) and I saw two morphing golden glowing disks about a mile up in the sky.  They retained their golden glowing colour with the same intensity whether on the blue of the sky or over the clouds.  They were flying in formation a few hundred feet away from each other, one slightly ahead of and above the other.  They seemed to be quite large, around the size of a small passenger plane, perhaps larger. My friend says their shape was originally flat, but they had morphed into ovals and disks by the time I got there.  They were flying across the sky at a slight incline at a moderate pace, similar to the speed of an airplane.  They flew roughly towards the sun and then accelerated and turned 180 degrees on a dime and flew back in the direction they came from.  Nothing I've ever seen in my life accelerates BEFORE turning 180 degrees in mid-air, and there were TWO of them flying in tandem.  They seemed to fly very much like the UFOs in many other videos I've seen recently, specifically, the ones over the BBC offices in London. At this point we both ran to the front of the apartment where we have another balcony.  They were flying very fast with an erratic almost playful flight pattern, darting in and out of the clouds in a southerly direction.  Stopping and hovering for a second here, a few seconds there, then they abruptly disappeared. The whole sighting lasted about five minutes, no more.  Unfortunately we got no photos or video.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
Falling light with a changing shape in rotation.;2012-10-24 22:22:00;2-3 seconds;Falling light with a changing shape in rotation. On a scattered cloudy night, perhaps no more than 40 degrees in elevation almost due North. Mid-sky what appeared at first to be a falling star, although many times brighter.   Dropped straight down, the light growing brighter and in size to an irregular shape that rotated and then like a flash dissapeared when it reached approx. 30 degrees in elevation.  No coloration a most pure white light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
