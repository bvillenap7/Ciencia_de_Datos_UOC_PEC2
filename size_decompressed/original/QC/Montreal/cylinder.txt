Bright silvery cigar cylinder object seen floating over the Montreal sky;2006-07-27 19:00:00;15 minutes;Bright silvery cigar cylinder object seen floating over the Montreal sky I was walking along Ste Catherine street, in Montreal, our main shopping downtown venue when I was looking at the sky because I'm intrigued about chemtrails. Anyway I noticed a shiny silver cylinder shaped object moving in a steady direction. Why I stopped to observe it was because it was too high in the sky to be a helicopter or a zepplin, it had no apparent wings nor was it emiting a trail of exhaust like a jet liner. The sun was starting to set so it made the object bright in the sky and it could be why I at first noticed it. It was moving too fast to be a weather ballon. Then after a while it dissapeared behind a building that made viewing it impossible. And after a while I kept looking up when I could have sworn I saw another. Then I felt silly and just got to were I was going.  I mentionned this to a friend who suggested I get it out of my mind and not tell anyone for fear they would consider me a bit kooky.  Still it has been nagging me and I just wanted to get it off my chest.  Thanks for being there for this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
