The movement wasn't fast but constant some were on the middle first dot frizes in spot and my feeling was that it waits for another wich was behind and lower. Second dot started move faster and some were in piont the first unfrizes and started to move in paralel and constant speed in corespondent to the second. I had have strange feeling and in this same moment The first dot stoped and I saw a bright light it was shining very bright for some few seconds and frizes and wanished as it was on 26 two days ago. A couple of hours I was watching the sky - nothing... and sudenly SE (soud-east) my view spoted the flash. I looked up and it was something that is hanging and something hapening. I took out my benoculars and point in direction of event. What i saw a vertical shape of something. Top had has a form of a water drop upsidedown made of shining bright aluminium metal like middle was a orange rad yellow white (mixed lights) in one center. Bottom was like a part of the pot just in shadow. And from the bottom to top around bright center was color like bluegreen clear bright collors. I check for the another dot but i didn't see it (something was moving on the background of the first vertical something) It was like that for a some time 30 - 60 min (i don't remember) And after it start to change the forms before it disapear again (it was fast and I don't remember this to);45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
First time experience they said nasa was hiding a secret mission from the people.;2006-06-12 01:00:00;3 hours;First time experience they said nasa was hiding a secret mission from the people. I was sleeping and kept feel like someone was in my room, when i finally got up to check around becuase the feeling got so intense that it felt like the tension in my room was so high that someone was in there.  When i found out no one was there i went back to bed, just to be woken up again, this time though there was a knocking on my window so i woke up and went to my window slowly, when i got there someone who i couldnt see but could hear very clear was telling me to come outside, when i got outside i was surrounded by unfamiliar species I never had believed in this sort of stuff so I couldnt really comprehend what was going on at the time when i tried to run back in the house this is exactly what happened to me. One of the aliens came right in front of me (out of no where) grabbed me and that was it i woke up and I couldn't figure out how long i was out for, but i was surrounded by onlookers of another life form, it wasnt how they make it look in the movies though it was very dark and you could see your breath it felt cold but it was warm. They(aliens) seemed very pleased and not eager to hurt me they couldnt understand what i was saying but for some reason i could almost understand everyword they said. They told me to lay down and relax they mean no harm im going to be safe if ( and then they said something about nasa) doesn't carry on with there mission, they held me for 3 hours they put me back to sleep to take me back to earth. I woke up in my backyard except for one thing, they left me with a peice of rock from another galaxy. I'll never not belive anyone who had this type of experience again.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
Stainless and brown object over Montreal;2007-03-15 12:00:00;10-20 seconds;Stainless and brown object over Montreal The event happened about five ago ( roughly mid mars) in Montreal (Canada) in Anjou suburb. I was heading to a mall at the corner of Chatillon and Joseph Renaud streets – Google earth 45’ 36’17.62 North - 73’32’45.43 West- when a saw the object. The air was clear, the sky was cloudless and a light wind could be felted. I was alone but it is probable that other people saw it. I live near a corridor often taken by commercial planes to land at Montreal Trudeau international airport in the axis of the landing runway if you prefer. The object was taking the same corridor as if preparing to land on the runway to… But it was obvious than it was NOT an air craft – nether commercial, military, or a hot air balloon (or a children helium inflated balloon) – it was not affected by the wind like it would had normally done. The objet was perfectly spherical and divided in two vertically. The left – or front part- looked like well shined stainless steel.  The “rear part was light brown – or dark beige – a bit remembering leather. It size could be compared as a dime held at arm length. It flew a about the same speed and altitude than commercial plane, in total silence and was not affected by the wind – as a balloon would have probably done as I did said. Its direction was about east to west. I observed it for around 10 to 15 seconds. Ps. I will soon send a photo and a description of a sort of crop circle that appeared behind my father 25 years ago (and still there)   Truly yours, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Bright orange orb gliding through the sky, above Montreal.;2019-07-28 01:30:00;2 minutes;Bright orange orb gliding through the sky, above Montreal. Sunday July 28th 2019- 1:30am Montréal, Québec, Canada.  I came home late from babysitting my sister's kids.  I let my dog out in the yard for her nightly pee.  I noticed my potted herbs were wilting and despite feeling very tired,  I decided to take the time to water them.  As I was doing that, something bright caught my eye.  It was a large orange orb in the sky.  It was moving rather slowly and eventually came to a stop for a moment and then continued its course in the sky.  Eventually, I lost sight of it. At first I thought a plane was on fire?  But it was very clearly a bright orange bubble of light that appeared to have two smaller and sharper lights towards the bottom of it.  The colour appeared more saturated along the circumference and it seemed as though there  was something more “structural” at the centre of it.  I didn’t have my phone on me for picture.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
