another silver disk;2007-06-09 20:30:00;6-7min;another silver disk Well this happened in st leonard I looked outside my window and saw a disk silver shape in the distance I know where the airplanes route roughly, where they fly around here but it was going east faded out, then was alot higher and went back west! very slow but when it went up it was over 500 feet and it kinda shined maybe cause of the sun but it went the other way and faded away ! very cool really I wouldnt of seen it but if u pay attention to the skys once in a while you might find some weird things.. Overall what I saw was unexplained;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
