Please proceed to detailed summary;1999-06-01 14:00:00;10 minutes;Please proceed to detailed summary Feb 29. 2000 Montreal, Canada Dear Roly James Last night,  a caller on your show described a night-time ariel phenomena as having a haze or a clouded atmosphere encircling it before it suddenly turned bright red and shot off into nowhere at an incredible speed. Last summer,  I observed a similar phenomena in full daylight. I was cycling with a friend and we had stopped to  rest in a local park area. The sky was generally clear - with the exception of a small hazy patch of cloud that  had somehow developed in one quarter. From where we stood we had an excellent view of the horizon - or as good as it gets on the outskirts of a big city. Eventually, my friend spied an unusual craft moving very slowly across the sky. It was light coloured (silvery white - very difficult to read in the mid afternoon sunlight) and somewhat angular appearing. At first I thought it was perhaps an ultralight of some variety - except it made no sound and moved too slowly - ie. should not have been airborne at that rate of speed.  Both of us were moved to high alert as we observed it very carefully for some minutes as it approached the cloudy area - which seemed to thicken. I began to suspect at this point that this anomalous cloud might have something to do with what we were seeing and I didn't so much as blink an eye as I watched the craft slowly merge with its outer edges. As the craft was just about to disappear behind the haze,  a bolt of light, like a lens flare or flashbulb discharge, erupted from its exact location. From my point of view, the object disappeared instantaneously and in a matter of moments thereafter, the  cloud dissolved completely. Although I scanned the skies for this object and traced its logical trajectory, after the flare, it was nowhere to be found. I stood there quite devastated, wondering what it was I had seen - even as the skies to the north and south of us were strewn with a checkerboard of contrails. A look at one of the planes that laid a large trail almost directly over our heads reveled that it was not a commercial plane - but a very large military craft - a two engine job resembling  a high altitude bomber of some description.  The sudden appearance of planes laying out contrails seemed deliberate. Were they mapping a location? Interestingly, my friend did not view the situation exactly as I did. Whether for fear of being implicated in a sighting or not, he insisted that he had seen the craft emerge from the other side of the cloud  and made repeated attempts to point it out to me. I have excellent eyesight and although I stood trying to get a focus on whatever it was he was attempting to call my attention towards, I saw nothing. It was both a puzzling and highly emotional experience and we actually got into an argument over the whole deal. I stand by my story - he by his. What he does conceede is that the event was suspicious. I would go much further than that. It does not take a genius to understand that this could be one of two things: a) ariel military test manouvres of  a new generation of air ship - the possible application of Bohm's non-locality and post quantum physics in faster than light transportation b) an incursion into North American airspace by some unknown entity One thing that;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
Crescent -shaped, silent, moving in a straight line, white, fuzzy edges, fast-moving.;2003-05-15 23:54:00;5 seconds;Crescent -shaped, silent, moving in a straight line, white, fuzzy edges, fast-moving. During the eclipse of the moon on Thursday, May 15 I saw what I would call a UFO as it was a flying object and I could not identify it. The time was 11:54 PM Eastern Time and the object flew at high speed over Montreal from west to east. It was not an airplane as it did not have any of the usual strobe lights and did not make any sound. It flew in a straight line and could not have been a light shining on the clouds as it was completely cloudless at the time and there was no beam of light going up to it. The object was of a crescent shape and flew with the concave side forward. it emitted a white light which was steady and unchanging, somewhat clear throughout but a bit fuzzy at the edges. As I saw the object, it covered about 1/4 of the sky in about 5 seconds and appeared to be flying somewhat lower than the cruising altitude of a jetliner. I don't know if anyone else saw it and I did not notice any media coverage.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896

UFO caught during a photoshoot;2007-06-09 18:00:00;1 second;UFO caught during a photoshoot I was shooting a model this afternoon and when I was developing the pictures I noticed an object that was hovering in the frame.  Since these pictures were taken in constant shutter release and a high speed (1/1000 sec.), there was no way for me to see it through my eyes. I have 9 shots in original RAW format.  That is a good thing because they can be blown up with any alterations.  The meta data is untouched. I can provide you either the jpgs or/and the raw files.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
20-30 moving lights in Montreal Canada.;2008-04-23 01:00:00;2 HOURS;20-30 moving lights in Montreal Canada. Hello, I was sitting in a car with a sunroof when I looked up and observed what looked like a star, a very bright one at that. I continued to look at it and noticed it was moving in a circular type motion, we then looked throughout the sky and noticed it wasn't the only one. We noticed there must have been between 20 and 30 of these moving stars. Some of them alone, some of them in 3's. When in 3's they formed a triangular trapazoid type shape. As I said some brighter than others but all making the same movements, as if they were hovering but sort of moving around and covering a very small area. Whatever this was, was there for over 2 hours. It was viewable from different areas in Montreal (Canada) as I called friends to go outside and look. It couldn't have been airplanes because there were no flashing lights whatsoever and it couldn't be a mass fleet of helicopters because there was no sound associated with what we saw. I've never seen an object move in the ways I witnessed these lights move. I have never seen or thought I had seen a ufo before last night's experience, but I am sure that what I saw was incredibly abnormal and nothing I have ever imagined.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896

Flight pattern was not evident.  At first, I thought these were beams of light projecting on the clouds, but I could not see any beams, just the round circles flying about. The direction was 113 degrees SE.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896

Suddenly I see coming lights from the south, they were like 100 or more, all in a V shaped formation going north direction.  They were travelling a little bit faster than a airplane jet and made no noise at all.  Then, they disappeared behind the buildings. I have video and photo proof.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
