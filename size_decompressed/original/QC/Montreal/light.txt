Two high flying white objects 5 minutes apart.;2001-07-17 20:30:00;15 minutes;Two high flying white objects 5 minutes apart. I was sitting on the backyard deck of my house located in the downtown Montreal area when I noticed a small white object, almost directly overhead and very high in the sky. It was moving slowly true north to true south. At first I thought that it was the setting sun reflecting on a satellite. I lost sight of it when it passed over my house. But about five minutes later, I saw the same object again (or was it another one?) moving in the exact same path and speed. I called my son to come out and he saw it too. This time, when it moved over my house, I went in front the house and continued to watch it for about 2-3 minutes , until I lost sight of it, approximately 45 degrees over the southern horizon. There was no sound or contrail. Is it possible that 2 satellites follow each other so closely in the same orbit? I am an engineer and so is my son. ((NUFORC Note:  There are many satellites that orbit around the planet.  Many of them are in polar orbit.  We suspect the witness observed two satellites.  PD));45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896

yellowish baige light shaped like a small rectangular shape but with design hard to say but easy to draw;2002-07-24 23:45:00;night;yellowish baige light shaped like a small rectangular shape but with design hard to say but easy to draw well the unknown object was the size of my thumb nail, but hard to say considering the object may have been out side our atmosphere depending on the size of the object. i was at work when i and 2 of my co-workers seen a light that was very dim not so bright like if were trying to camuflage it self in the night sky. it then moved a little to the right towards north east and then it apeared to be moving straight up into space. the reason i say that is because as it was moving upwards it was getting very small in size. then after a short period of time it looked like a star in the sky then the object was no longer visible with the naked eye. i hope to find out what the object was or to know if anyone else saw what we had seen.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
A brilliant shape lengthened cross the sky disappear, reappear and redisappear. No trails No sound;2003-07-15 20:25:00;40 secondes;A brilliant shape lengthened cross the sky disappear, reappear and redisappear. No trails No sound I was geting outdoor to sit  down and take fresh air. I sit down and begin to watch the sky and i saw a bright light in front of me on a blue sky but far away. At first i thought that it was the sun reflecting on a plane like a mirror. The altitude was just above the thin cloud at my left and was going in relatively the same speed (maybe faster). It was going in my direction but a litlle on the left. I noticed no trails and all other plane was doing trail this day. No sound too. I was thinking: this plane look realy like a ufo! After a little wile the object was passing under the very thin clouds at my left and I still saw it . It was brigther and i never saw  wings on that thing, just a brilliant form lengthened. Suddenly, that  vanished like we put off a light. I did not see it any more. But a few seconds later it reappeared like it was vanishing few second ago! For  disapaing again a few second later and leaving the sky empty.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  The 4 lights at equal distance from one another.;2003-10-17 20:15:00;approx: 70 minutes;The 4 lights at equal distance from one another. On Friday evening at 8:15 p.m. est I had a call from a youngster who wanted to make a report on some unusual lights which the family had been watching. What I didn't realize was that while they were talking to me on the phone, the display of lights were taking place right now. The youngster asked if I would like to talk to her mother, she called for her to come to the telephone and the Mom described what they were observing at the moment.  About an hour before arriving at their home, the family was at the shopping center and mentioned they could see the lights in the sky. Now calling me from their home, they are looking out the window and watching an amazing display of lights high above them in the sky. The 4 lights at equal distance from one another stayed in the same area in the sky, they turned around as if one would be looking at a Ferris wheel. She also noticed aircraft moving close to where the lights were. The witness described the lights as being a neon green in color. She also told me the lights would turn like the hands on a clock, but very quickly, then they would come together in the middle, becoming very bright. Then the lights would move back out again and perform the same maneuvers all over again but moving faster each time. No sound was heard.  Thank you to the family for the report.

Suburbs of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, bright light, shadow of possible large craft.;2006-08-22 00:45:00;00:01;Suburbs of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, bright light, shadow of possible large craft. It was 12:45 in the morning, I was lying in bed listening to the radio and all of the surrounding trees outside my window went dark for about 2 seconds as if something large passed overhead.  I got out of bed and looked out the window but saw nothing.  Then about a half hour later I saw a bright light, that I thought looked something like a shooting star.  What made it different than a star is it made an abrupt angle downward and dissapeared behind some trees.  I listened to hear if something crashed, like a meteor or something, but I heard nothing.  It was a very bright, white light, something like a firework, with a short tail.  Again, there was no sound.  I called the local radio station to see if anyone had phoned in but no one had.  I then called the police station to see if anyone called there with a weird sighting, but no one had called there either.  I do realize that me lying in bed is the perfect place for me to fall asleep or doze off and imagine something, but right after I saw the trees in the back go dark I woke up my Dad and told him.  Then I went back to bed.  That's when I saw the bright light fall behind the trees.  I didn't see any shape or form, just a light with a short tail.  I might also mention that my radio was on the whole time and at no time was there any kind of signal disturbance.;45.5223717685162;-73.59371869896
