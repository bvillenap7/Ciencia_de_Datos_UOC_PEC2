A little silver shphere darts across the sky for 10-15 seconds, seen from inside a moving car.;1997-08-30 16:35:00;10-15 seconds;A little silver shphere darts across the sky for 10-15 seconds, seen from inside a moving car. This sighting happened about 3 days after my daughter was born. Having a serious interest in UFO and aliens, and having read a lot abut that topic, I marveled at how much my baby daugher looked like a Grey alien, with her huge blue eyes in her tiny face, and I wished that the aliens would know telepathically that I was thinking of them for that specific reason.  So, around the day and time specified, I was driving back home (alone) from the hospital for some reason, when I saw this little silver sphere traverse the sky in the general dirction I was traveling. It appeared suddenly over the rim of my windshield and traveled forward in the sky for about 10 to 15 secondds, until it go hidden by buildings on the side of the street.  It looked to me as having the size of a toy marble and I could tell it was a sphere and not a disk because it seemed tridimensional to me and it had a thin waving yellow-and-black rim around its circumference that seemed to indicate that it was enveloped in heat or in some sort of (electromagnetic?) energy.  The whole incident lasted only from 10 to 15 seconds but I was convinced that it was the aliens' way to letting me know that they had gotten the message about my daughter.
