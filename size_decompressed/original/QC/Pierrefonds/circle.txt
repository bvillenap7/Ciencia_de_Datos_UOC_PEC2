Craft with bright red light speeding across sky.;2012-07-08 21:24:00;10 minutes;Craft with bright red light speeding across sky. At 21:24 on Sunday July 8 at west Montreal, me and a friend were outside when he pointed out a bright red light in the sky. It disappeared into the sky 10 seconds after being sighted.  I had the time to take a picture (which came out terrible because of the quality of my phone).  We were just playing basketball on the street when my friend noticed it.  It went at quite a speed and didn't look anything like an airplane of any kind it was much bigger for one, it was round and fast, and there was a red haze/light surrounding it.;45.4721524390244;-73.874968292683
