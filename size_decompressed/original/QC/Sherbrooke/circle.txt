2 white orbs UFO in day time, and then jets.  Very bright.;2016-05-07 19:00:00;5 minutes;2 White Orbs UFO in day time, and then jets.  Very bright. I was heading back to my house and when I look at the sky I spotted 2 White Orb moving at a decent speed. They were both moving at the same speed and were kinda far from each other.  They seem to fly under the cloud so they were probably not that high in the sky. I found 3 videos that show the same objects I've seen today. Here's the links:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH4RUWRs_0k  This one show the 2 white orbs, this is exactly as I seen them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfRuZ0CzAyw  In this one you can see that the orb looks like to be 2 spheres or 2 ballons attached to each other, the front one seems to be pulling the other one, it looks like some material stretching. I only spotted them with my own eyes but it looked like this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zebJItX4XF8 In this video it's hard to tell what we are looking at but the speed and the altitude of the object correspond to my sighting. When I spotted the 2 objects I tried to keep an eye on them until I reach my house, the fastest as I could and call my friend who lived in the direction they were heading.  When I turned a corner, there was an house and then a couple trees that blocked my sight and I couldn't see them anymore. Called my friend and he recorded a plane... BUT!  That plane was a jet, heading in the direction of the UFOs. And literally 5 min after my sighting, which concord with the time my friend recorded the jet,  I heard a plane or jet fly over my house. You know, the loud noise they make... you can hear it in the first video I linked too.;45.3894082742317;-71.9336867612293
