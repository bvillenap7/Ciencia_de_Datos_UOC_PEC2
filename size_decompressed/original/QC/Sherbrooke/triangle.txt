V-Shaped Triangle UFO;2011-05-06 22:45:00;00:00:05;Me, my brother and 3 friends were outside smoking a cigarette a my new brother house.  I we were chatting outside, I was sort of looking north, when suddenly this object entered my field of vision, instantly i pointed it to my friends and we all saw it but my brother who thought i was joking.  It was a V-Shaped Triangle UFO formed of lights.  The Lights intensity could be compared to those of stars in the sky.  The object made no noise. It was very low in altitude, around 300-500 feet right above us. We saw this object around 3-5 seconds before it faded in the distance going north.  There was no clouds in the sky and the visibility was clear if it wasn't of the time of the day.  This object couldn't had been birds, hang-glider, balloons, paratrooper, flares, chinese-lantern or any planes i know.  This object can't be from black projects because i have no idea what the US Army would be doing in Sherbrooke, Canada.;45.3894082742317;-71.9336867612293
