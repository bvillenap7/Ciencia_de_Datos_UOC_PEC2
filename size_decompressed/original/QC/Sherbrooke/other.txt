My wife and I were sitting on the porch when we saw 2 silver shinning Donut shaped objects with red, blue, orange flashing lights.  They were hovering maybe at 1/2 a mile away and maybe 5000-10000 ft in altitude going from west to south/east at  a slow speed. I grabbed my camera and took  a few photos ( 6 photos). the last photo can be seen with orange glow, maybe exiting our atmosphere ?;45.3894082742317;-71.9336867612293
