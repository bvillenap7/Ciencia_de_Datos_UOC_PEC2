I've seen two ufo's. I was with two girlfriends the first time, and my friend and his sister the second time – none of us were on drugs either time we were about 15-16 years old (1993-1994) – the date might be off by a year (1992?). (And they saw it too one, the daughter of a Doctor (MD) recently told me she has seen them again since. The other three are now parents I am single.) I think (based on the Drake equation etc.) that there must be life out there, but still I would need to see it for myself to really know if these lights that we saw were piloted by alien beings all I know, is I - we - saw these ufo’s - and they were NOT gas, weather, planes, satellites, meteors etc. Either way, whether aliens or human made, it's incredible the speeds and mobility and hovering abilities of these ufo's. The first one was seen on a starry night. It was located really far up, at about within our atmosphere seen from Georgeville, Quebec. It move incredible distances in swirly figure-eight-type, seemingly random patterns, for such high distance relative to us, moving almost as if either testing it's maneuverability, or maybe even just wasting time, with nothing to do - this is my intuition about the flying patterns that it made but then stopping on a dime, making right angles, even 180 degree changes in direction - it looked just like a star, a bright white orb, but moved like one of those super fast shinny green flies you see in the country, only, this was happening over great distances and about within or near to our atmosphere, hence the estimate of it moving great distances (100+ KM? in a second)and at great speeds. It lasted so long, over 20 minutes, that even as teenagers we got bored of looking at it, then went back in our tent and drank one bottle of cheap wine and ev! entually falling asleep. The second time, within the same year, or possibly within two years of the first sighting, the ufo appeared as an orange-multicoloured light-of-an-orb, about 2-3 KM off the earth, and we saw it from about 5-7 KM away, up on a slight hill, looking over the Magog river valley it was maybe… 10’-30’ or more in diameter – if it was only just one, as we saw it light up from the dark of the night sky, hovering there for about 2-3 minutes at a time, then going out (disappearing/turning the light of the orb ‘off’) and then reappearing in a slightly higher and off to the side, new position (assuming that it was the same orb) and repeating this pattern several times, before one last time where it directed an arch-like orange laser towards the ground and this laser then reflected back up to the orb -  depicted graphically as one would draw radio waves emitting from a radio tower – and then a loud sonic boom followed a few seconds after it disappeared.

Looked like pieces of falling meteor...instead of burning out they spaced out evenly and flew North parallel to earth at great speed.;2021-05-17 21:30:00;25 seconds;Looked like pieces of falling meteor...instead of burning out they spaced out evenly and flew North parallel to earth at great speed.;45.3894082742317;-71.9336867612293
