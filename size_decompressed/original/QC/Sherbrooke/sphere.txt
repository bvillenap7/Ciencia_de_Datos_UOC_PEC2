I think I saw a UFO on May 22th 21h30..;1999-05-22 21:30:00;30 seconds;I think I saw a UFO on May 22th 21h30.. I was on a trip to sherbrooke in Quebec for the 'Festival Des Harmonies Du Qu√©bec'.  I was playing soccer with my friends when I was the goalie, then I looked the dark sky, it was 21h30, and I saw a kind of purple-brown boomerang (like the moon, but 2 times bigger, and dark). It was stable (always the same shape) but it was moving very fast (not like a asteroid, slow, but because it's far, it's fast...like a far car...you know). It's not a plane (too far and too big), not a buterfly :o). Normaly i'm septic on everyting about UFOs, but now I trust in. I immediately told Diego my friend about this and he saw it, too. Then it dissapered. We were both fascinated about what we see. Nobody trust us, of course, but I AM SURE OF WHAT I'VE SAW I think the NASA hide the truth.. I'm sure they often see UFO, and they fake their pictures.. I'm pretty sure. I am sending via e-mail images@ufocenter.com ... It's now a real pic, just a draw to describe the view.;45.3894082742317;-71.9336867612293
