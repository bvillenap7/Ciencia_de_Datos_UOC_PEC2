8 lights in formation moving synchronously.;2020-12-05 18:45:00;3- 5 minutes;8 lights in formation moving synchronously. Clear night, a formation of 8 lights in single file appeared in the sky. They looked like stars, but then I noticed that they were moving together. I thought they were perhaps military planes, but all of a sudden they vanished.;45.4317294117647;-73.8691117647059
I just returned from walking my dog when I turned to the NW and saw what I thought were 3 stars, but then noticed one was moving, then;2021-05-09 23:30:00;2-3 minutes that we saw;I just returned from walking my dog when I turned to the NW and saw what I thought were 3 stars, but then noticed one was moving, then noticed all 3 were actually moving...I watched as more and more moved into my view from behind the trees before disappearing behind the trees on the other side...I watched for about a minute, of coarse thinking I was nuts, but then called out my 20 year daughter who also saw them...We then watched for about 2 more minutes before the stopped...We tried to video them but the lights were too far to catch on video...I have the videos but nothing can be seen...The were moving in a straight line, one after the other, but not in uniform distance from each other...Some were closer to each other, some further...Does anything happen with this report? Thanks!;45.4317294117647;-73.8691117647059
