Loc: 45-26-00.86N, 73-52-03.18W Cloudiness 6/10, Sun low towards west. Bright spot noticed among clouds, direction N-NE. First suspected balloon of some kind, but did not move with clouds, rather perpendicular to them, moved too slow for a high flying airplane. Then lost sight for about one minute. Object suddenly reappears seemingly much lower, flying at very high speed towards E-SE, completely noiseless. Based on frequent airplane sightings in the area (nearby Trudeau airport is quite busy) this object flew at least twice as fast as other commercial airplanes - if at the similar altitude. I had binoculars with me but could not use them. I cannot state anything about the shape, light seemed to be reflection of a spherical object but I cannot be sure. Light was bright white. Due to the hight density of the population in the area, Sunday afternoon and nice weather, other witnesses might be expected.;45.4317294117647;-73.8691117647059
