2 green lights fly by fast and vanish;2009-08-05 00:45:00;2 seconds;2 green lights fly by fast and vanish So I'm on my computer on facebook with a big window to me left which is facing south and I am right by the Ottawa river I look out and I see this object with 2 green lights on it that just flew by and vanished in the sky I know for a fact it was not a plane or jet of any type because I had full sight on it the whole was and it just vanished it was extremely quick also I didn't really get chance to see shape I would say it was circular based on the lights. It flew from aylmer towards the ottawa area. When I saw it I could not talk or move for at least 10 seconds then my eyes started watering.. pretty weird considering just last week an unidentified flying object crashed on the Ottawa river at the deschenes rapids which is right beside here. Oh yes and it was also loud enough for me to here in here although the sound only lasted about 1 second.;45.4008;-75.8479
