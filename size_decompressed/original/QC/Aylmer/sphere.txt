glowing orange spheres in aylmer quebec;2002-05-29 23:59:00;5-10 minutes;glowing orange spheres in aylmer quebec I was coming home from work at about midnight, when i seen 2 orange sphere's in the sky, I would estimate that they were about 1000-1500 feet above the ground, and about the size of an average house.  They were very bright, and hovered in the general area for about a minute, then one of them stoped glowing for a split second and when it apeared again it was a great distance above the other one, perhaps several hundred feet.  The problem is it changed locations so fast that I can not believe it was man made. And it was a sperical ball of light, not resembling spot lights at all.  I was so amazed that i pulled over my jeep and got out to gaze at them hovering over the ottawa river, then without any sound they disapeared like they had stoped glowing. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness means midnight of May 29, 2002.  We have amended the time of the alleged incident to indicate that.  PD));45.4008;-75.8479
