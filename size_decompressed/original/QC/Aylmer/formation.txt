Three lights flying in a perfect triange formation. There was absolutely no sound, so it's doubtful it was an airplane(s). We followed them across the sky for about 15-20 seconds and then they scattered very fast. I swear this is the truth ! ((NUFORC Note:  The U. S. Navy triplet of NOSS satellites may have been orbitting Earth at this time.  They were still visible in early 1996, when NUFORC first witnessed them, and first began to investigate that phenomenon.  However, if the three objects described in this report did, in fact, scatter, as the witness describes, they could not have been satellites flying in formation.  PD));45.4008;-75.8479
