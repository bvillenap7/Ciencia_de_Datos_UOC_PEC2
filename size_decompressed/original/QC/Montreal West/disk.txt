I was taking pictures from my attic window of the southwest view of Saturn, Mars, and Antares which appeared last night in a curved line.  I gave the camera some zoom.  A major airport lies in that direction.  Twice I had to wait for airplanes to exit the frame.  In one photo (shutter speed 1 sec), the airplane is still in the frame and appears like a blurred, slightly elongated light, as would be expected.  I took 16 photos.  I chose the photo that showed Mars and Saturn at its clearest.  Then I did post-processing to improve contrast and saturate the colors, so that Mars's redness was fully evoked. As I began the post-processing, I noticed a streak in the upper left.  I cleaned my computer screen, but the streak was still there and moved with the photo.  I then feared I must have a scratch on my lens. I checked the other 15 photos--no streak.  Then I enlarged the photo to see a disk-like object with six lights--3 pairs of lights that are reddish.  The shutter speed was 4 seconds for that shot, so the object was not moving since it is very clear with no movement blur.  I compared it to the photo that shows the airplane leaving the frame--no resemblance.  The UFO is a disk with six lights and crystal clear.  I also looked up pictures of satellites photographed from Earth--no resemblance.  I have no idea what the object is, and I can't speculate. I am sending you the photo with the saturated colors.  If you want the original photo or the photo with the airplane for comparison, let me know. Sincerely,  ((woman's name deleted));45.4523;-73.6532
