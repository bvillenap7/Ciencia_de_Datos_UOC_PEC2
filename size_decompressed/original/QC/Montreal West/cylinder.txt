Nov 17, 2015 in Montreal West, Quebec, at 3:30 am I got up to take pictures of rising planets from my upper floor window with an easterly view.  I saw a red blinking light.  It was flying from due east headed in a southeasterly direction. I assumed it was an airplane, but then it suddenly reversed direction and started flying back due east.  Also, it was lower in the sky than most airplanes.  At one point, it was partially obscured by the bare branches of a large tree. After it cleared the tree, I was able to get it in my camera viewfinder (but no time to take a picture).  My zoom lens has 60 x magnification.  For the few seconds that I observed it under high magnification, I saw a long cylinder that was lit up with translucent red light from one end to the other.  I did not see any wings on the object.  Object then curved to fly due north before leaving my field of vision. There may be a logical explanation for it, but the flying behaviour was a bit bizarre.
