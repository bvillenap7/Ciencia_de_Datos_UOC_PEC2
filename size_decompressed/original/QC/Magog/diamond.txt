Diamond shaped craft. Night time, about 50 yards.;2005-11-21 18:45:00;5-10 Seconds;Diamond shaped craft. Night time, about 50 yards. Im 16, I was just driving home with my dad from Magog.  We were about 5-10 minutes from Stanstead and I was bored so anything could catch my eye, my dad on the other hand was focusing on driving.   I caught the glare of what I thought was a particularly bright room light in a house maybe.  But as I looked at it I noticed it was formed in a Diamond like shape.  Still, in greatly moronic fashion I turned to my dad and said, Wow, odd they have windows on that house like that.  My dad turned his head to see what exactly I was so amazed by.  As I saw his eyes widen I returned my view to the house.  But I then realized it was only 4 lights, and 2 new ones were floating off to the right of the diamond shaped Alignment.  Just as quickly as I caught sight of it the diamond figure began to seemingly shrink, but im no idiot and my grasp upon physics and relative distance is fairly good.  What was really happening was it began to distance itself from me.  Originating at about 50 yards from me.  Heading towards 1 O'Clock.   But the bizarre part was that the 2 lights I hadnt noticed at the beggining remained there, and stedfast. Just as I took grasp of what this, we had been blinded by a wall of trees next to us. We continued onward and shortly after noticed a Jet flying over into the U.S. border.  My dad knew the area quite well.  He had driven those roads for ages, and the trail that led to where the supposed house was, was really a logging trail, no houses.  Im just as stumped as youâ€¦;45.2644;-72.1496
