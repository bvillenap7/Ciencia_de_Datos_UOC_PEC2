3 orange lights in a triangular shape;2012-09-01 22:00:00;5 minutes;3 orange lights in a triangular shape The whole thing lasted about 5 minutes. We were sitting on the deck in our backyard. My wife first noticed the lights in the sky just above and to the left of our neighbors tree. She pointed it out to the rest of us and we all looked up. We saw two orange lights about the size of a quarter . There was no noise, there were perfectly still. We observed them for about  one minute. Then a third orange light came from the south and joined the other two to form a triangle of lights. We watched the three of them for a minute. They then moved in unison a little towards the east, stopped and remained for about a minute. Then the light at the top of the triangle started to move away and began to fade. The remaining two lights moved again to the left and remained there for another minute, and then a second one moved away and faded like the first. After another minute, the third light moved away and faded the same way as the first two. This was the strangest event we have ever witnessed. My son who was at a friendâ€™s home in the same area also observed these light and managed to take a picture of two of them on his cell phone. He will keep this as evidence of our sighting.

Object at far distance with bright flashing lights (blue, green and red).  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD));2013-03-29 23:09:00;I don't know how long the;Object at far distance with bright flashing lights (blue, green and red) I saw a bright light in the sky.  The fact that it seemed to move slightly brought my attention to it.  No other stars could be seen, as the clouds were making the night very dark. Looking at the moving light I first thought that it was an illusion so I put my glasses on and saw that there were some flashing lights on the object.  I decided to take a closer look with my Fujifilm Finepix and zoomed 18 times closer.  What I saw was a bright moving object that was intermitently flashing red, green, and blue.  I took a video on the same camera and even though the quality isn't the best, we clearly see the colors changing. I don't know how long it stayed there but I noticed that it had moved a little further and after about 5 minutes I could hardly see it as a tree's branches were in front of it. I told one of my friend over the internet and I moved away from the window but kept having a glance to make sure to see it if it would be moving. About a minute after I stopp! ed watching it, I went back to the window and notice that it was gone. I looked everywhere around in the sky but I didnt see any other light that was looking like that one. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD));45.3698219512196;-73.7414390243902
Over 50 bright little white lights were spotted in the East. After 10 minutes they shot in the air and disappeared.;2013-08-24 15:30:00;10 minutes;Over 50 bright little white lights were spotted in the East.  After 10 minutes they shot in the air and disappeared Over 50 little white lights were sighted in the East.  They formed a circle.  Looked through binoculars, we could see that they were bright white lights, shining in the high distance.  We could not see them if we were not wearing sun glasses.   This sighting was seen by 5 people which included my neighbors.  This is not the first sighting of these lights.   After about 10 minutes they shot up in the sky and disappeared.  My husband took a video with his phone but unfortunately we can not see the lights.  Maybe a better camera or equipment can make it clearer but we do not have this here.;45.3698219512196;-73.7414390243902
