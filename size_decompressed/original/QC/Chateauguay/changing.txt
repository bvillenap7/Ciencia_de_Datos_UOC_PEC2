Pulsating bright greenish white object that hovered and then disapeared into thin air;2005-09-25 02:00:00;1-2 minutes;Pulsating bright greenish white object that hovered and then disapeared into thin air Last night I went out to a friends we had dinner etc and went back to his place for a while and after that I decided to walk home while walking back i do like I always do look into the sky once in a while to see the nice stars.. but this time when i was half way back to my house i looked up at the sky again and noticed a greenish whitish object in the sky that seemed to hover move left and then disapear in about 1-2 minutes.. it did not go up either it just seemed to have vanished into thin air... no sound from what I could make out.  Also it did not change shape persay .. it was like pulsating.. i dont know how to explain it I guess you can call it changing shape but it did so in a rhythmic pulsating manner.  I have never seen anything like that in my life.... I wish I had a camera that night;45.3698219512196;-73.7414390243902
