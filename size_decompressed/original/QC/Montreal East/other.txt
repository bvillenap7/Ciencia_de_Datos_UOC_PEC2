My 14 month old son woke up thirsty and while his milk was warming, I walked over to my living room window and looked outside.  A bright object caught my eye in the sky.  At first, your brain automatically assumes it's a plane, however, within seconds I realized that it wasn't....  The object was star shaped and was very bright and was just hovering in the sky, not moving.  Then, the light grew even brighter and bigger, and the object slowly moved left and right, up and down.  I was starting to be scared at this point as my brain was registering what I was seeing.  For only a second or two, I lowered my head to look at my son and when I looked up, the object was gone, vanished.  Even a plane couldn't dissapear that fast - I have a Huge window so the sky view from it covers a lot.... Took me 2 hrs to fall alseep afterwards...;45.6287;-73.5074
