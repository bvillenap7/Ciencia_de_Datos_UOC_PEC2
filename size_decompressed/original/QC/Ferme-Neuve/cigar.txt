Luminous stationnary cigar shaped objet seen in Québec sky;2001-05-13 18:45:00;3 -4 minutes;Luminous stationnary cigar shaped objet seen in Québec sky The luminous cigar shaped objet just seemed to hang very high in the sky for over one minute then it slowly vanished to our pleasure and amazement it reappeared at the same place a few minutes later same intensity and again slowly disapeared ... we were fishing on a lake in Quebec some thirty odd miles from Mont-Laurier thing is i have no idea what type of objet that high, can stay that long at the same place altitude ??? Truly a Unidentified stationnary objet .. it was not a star as i have studied Astronomy and i think i can identify a plane when i see one  what else is there..?;46.7007;-75.4475
