three lights forming a perfect triangle;2006-03-29 19:07:00;a minute or so;three lights forming a perfect triangle it was three lights , red blue white, coming to me almost horizontal, they where not flashing at all, first i tough it was a plane, sky was very dark , then the three lights, moves like just turning toward me forming a perfect triangle.  so i parked my jeep aside, pull down the window with my left hand, trying to reach my digital camera on the right one , no time the thing start going back to an horizontal way, then speed incruise drastically, then slowered about the same way, and then disapear slowly out of my sight. nb, ther was a young teen, walking on the other side of the street, and it seems to me that he never notice anything.  so perhaps no sound at all.
