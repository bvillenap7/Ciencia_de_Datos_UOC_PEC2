Silent and fast triangle heading from east to west at low altitude;2015-08-13 22:30:00;10 seconds;Silent and fast triangle heading from east to west at low altitude My mom and I were out looking at the Perseids. I was the first one to see it then I pointed it out to my mom.  It was a triangle flying really fast from East to West. It was faster than a plane, way faster. The triangle was flying at a low altitude, lower than any planes that we saw tonight. It also seemed like it was gliding in a perfect line. It was also silent, which really surprised us because we taught that with that low altitude we would hear something. We saw it for about 10 seconds then it simply vanished from the night sky.
