2 strange large lighted objects in sky at dusk.;2015-07-24 21:15:00;8-10 minutes;2 strange large lighted objects in sky at dusk While driving from Magog to Montreal tonight with my son, we noticed a large bright white light in the sky ahead of us (approximtly 9:15 p.m.) it was stationary as we watched it we noticed another one about 20 to thirty kilometers further ahead in the sky the same appearance as the the closer one to us both still not moving not blinking and quite large given the fact that our line of sight of it put it higher than the clouds as we lost sight of 1st one now behind a dark cloud patch, still watching I did catch a glimpse of it through a hole in the cloud between us and the object.   I asked my son to keep looking for it as we were pretty well underneath the area we spotted it, at the same we were watching the second light in the horizon that seemed about 15-20 km ahead exactly the same appearance as the first one, a large bright white light not blinking and stationary, the sky was all clear except for small dark cloud which came between us and the 2nd object for about 5 seconds and then was visible again, given the distance away and the fact that it was above the clouds and the size and intensity of the light it had to be extremely large, and then as we watched in a single instant it was gone,   We were both shaken, in my 52 years of life I have never seen anything like this. As we watched the sky for any signs of light we did spot a helicopter off to the right With the usual beacon lights flashing well below the clouds and far off to the left another micro- dot light with beacon lights flashing clearly indentifying it as an aircraft. I have no explanation for what I witnessed.;45.3199;-72.6469
