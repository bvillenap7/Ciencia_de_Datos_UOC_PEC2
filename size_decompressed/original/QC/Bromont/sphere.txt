Big circular object falling from the sky at 70 degree angle approx. Covered a big distance within 2-3 seconds. ((Meteor??));2005-11-14 19:45:00;2-3 seconds;Big circular object falling from the sky at 70 degree angle approx.  Covered a big distance within 2-3 seconds.  Definitely fell to the ground within 10 miles.  Green flames coming from sides, as a deflector shield or if the sphere was burning up because of friction. Inside of sphere was reddish, as glowing. Kind of scary.  Could be a meteorite, but it was big and such a big object falling to the ground would have made quite a bang, which I lividly kind of expected when I saw it coming down.  Was not a shooting star. Too slow, too close, could see its spherical shape because of moonlight and green flames that outlined contour.
