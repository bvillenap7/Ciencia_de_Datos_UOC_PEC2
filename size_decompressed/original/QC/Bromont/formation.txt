Hello,  Time & date mentioned above is approximate. It definitely took place during that week though.  The reason why I can be sure of this, was due to the time of year.  The end of the first week & beginning of the second week of August is the time of year when we get a lot of 'shooting stars'  My girlfiend & I drove from Longueil, (just south of Montreal) to Bromont, approx 45 minutes east of Montreal, to get away from the light pollution, so we could see the shooting stars better.  We were parked near Mont Shefford, a small ski hill.  While watching the sky for shooting stars, we observed a formation type craft.  There were several sections to it, however, it was a completely connected structure. It was large, about the 3/4 size of a football field.  It moved slowly across the sky (unknown in what direction).  There was no sound, complete silence. There were no bright lights on the object, however the object was brighter than the night sky, so I would say it was dimly lit. (I do not know if I should answer below if there were lights on it or not)  It is difficult to determine the distance from the ground to the object.  Minimum 2500 feet, probably more.  Our initial reaction was that we were looking at the the International Space Station. That was the only logical explanation we could come up with.  This theory was dismissed by a speaker at the Dow Planetarium in Montreal when we asked him if it was possible to see the Space Station from the ground.  We described the object to him, and he quizzicaly looked at us.  It was as if he knew what we had seen, but he would not elaborate on it.  Note:  I am in the process of moving.  I will leave my future address, & my daytime phone number, as my residential number may change.;45.3199;-72.6469
