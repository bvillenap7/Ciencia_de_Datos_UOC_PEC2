Big grey-black rectangular ufo flying really slowly.;2004-03-30 11:00:00;20 seconds;Big grey-black rectangular ufo flying really slowly. Lately, I've been thinking about this event that I had put in the back of my mind and I wanted to get some answers, now that I started doing some research and knowing that UFOS really exist. I was 11 years old, sitting in school and when I looked outside the window, I saw this huge rectangular shape flying really really slowly (maybe 5-10km/h) in the clear blue sky.  I'm 100% sure it wasn't a plane or helicopter, balloon or whatever.   It was grey or black I can't remember and there was some sorts of tubings or smaller rectangular shapes on it.   I'm the only witness because I didn't dare to ask anyone else if they were seeing it,  I was kind of hypnotized and feeling so calm, it's weird to describe.   I saw it for about 20 seconds until I couldn't see it because of the window. I never thought much about it, kinda forgot about it, until now.  I'm really curious to know if there is any other similar ufo sightings (I havn't seen a lot of rectangular ufos on the internet) and if you know what kind of alien species have this type of engine?
