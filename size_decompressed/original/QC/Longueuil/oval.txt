unexplained oval shaped lights in the sky.;2002-07-03 23:50:00;5 to 10 seconds;unexplained oval shaped lights in the sky. I was sitting on my balcony relaxing,wondering if I was going to see a falling star. Then out of nowhere there were two oval shaped lights,they looked like they were coming straight down towards me.Then they stopped desending and  they started to move south-west at the same time they were turning around eachother.When they stopped turning they flew straight and then up and they were gone at an incredible speed. I don't know what it was,but it was nothing I have ever seen before.;45.5328806282722;-73.4938824607333
