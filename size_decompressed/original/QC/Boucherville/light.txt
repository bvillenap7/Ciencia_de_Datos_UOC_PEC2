I was stargazing outside with my telescope, it is a really nice night out here. Then my girlfriend who just got out of the pool told me that there is a satellite above, i look don't see a thing. Couple of seconds later i was searching to find it and she says that it as changed direction and picked up speed. I then spotted the objet, was a little light (about -1 in magnitude) going full south but arrived from north-west. I've never seen anything like this and i'm used to spot satellites. I've seen MANY satellites in my 20 years experience of amateur astronomy.;45.5954000000001;-73.4364999999999
Round bright light object moving at the speed of light;2012-11-14 19:30:00;1-2 seconds;Round bright light object moving at the speed of light At about 19:30 on November 14th  2012, I was walking along a bike path situated on Marie Victorin street in the town of Boucherville, Quebec, Canada.  I walk there pretty much everyday of the week, usually within 18:00 and 24:00 and I walk about 3.8 km.  Today, I decided to have my walk right after dinner, so I left home at about 19:10.   At about a third of the way I look up ( meaning above the horizon line ) straight ahead of me and I noticed between a street lamp post and wires crossing the street a circular bright light ( very bright, like a powerfull del light ) the object remained motionless for less than half a second and then moved left at a speed that no aircraft nor anything else could reach and vanished completely not to be seen again, there was no sound emitted and i could make out any shape other than the round light.   I'm a skeptic of the stories of flying saucers and green almond eyed aliens seen in movies, but what I saw here is no mistaking, unexplainable.  I told my wife about it and she believes I was tired or I hallucinated it but I would take a polygraph if I have to.
