Good morning, phone call follow upâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Aviation specialist reports overt sighting of two very strange objects.  PD));2004-07-21 23:16:00;12 secs;((NUFORC Note:  The following report was submitted by a person who has worked in the aviation industry for many decades, and who is eminently qualified to distinguish aircraft from other types of objects.  We spoke with him at length via telephone, and we deem him to be an exceptionally qualified witness.  PD)) Good morning,  Phone call follow up. Sitting on the patio, looking straight up at stars, when two objects flew past the edge of the roof of my condo.  Objects appeared to be the size of an airbus 320 at 2500 feet.   Objects were in a very tight formation, one ahead the other by half its length.  Both objects were identical, dim red color, like the glow of a lit cigarette, or a hot coal cooling off.   No sound that i could hear. The vehicles had a complex shape. The front part was wider than the main body, manta like shape. The main body was rectangular, tapering off towards the rear. At arms lenght they were 7 inches long, and 1.5 inches wide. The speed was approx 350 knots.  I lost sight of them at approx 15 degrees above the horizon.I estimate their altitude at between 2 and 3 thousand feet. I omitted some details for the sake of conciseness.  Available for further info.  Thanks.   ((name deleted)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))   Good morning Mr. Davenport   In  my rush to send report, i made a few mistakes.
