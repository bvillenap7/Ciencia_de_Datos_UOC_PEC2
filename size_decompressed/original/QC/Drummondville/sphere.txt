From my point of view they were around 1cm in diameter in the sky at first glance I was thinking they were birds but I follow the object from where I saw them standing and follow them with my eye for around 15-20sec. They were moving away from me and when I lost sight they might have been around 1 to 2 km away so I doubt I could follow birds that far in the night sky.;45.8946;-72.5421545851528
