octogonal yellow flashing light.;2004-11-15 22:27:00;1;octogonal yellow flashing light. Object was about 100 meters above ground.  Close to highway 20 between Quebec city and Drummondville at km 232.  Octogonal shape with yellow light flashing.  Standing still.  At 23:00 I stopped in Drummondville and saw a yellow light high in the sky moving at about 10 times the speed of an earth satellite (about 5 times slower than a wishing star) we can see on clear night.  The object made a sharp turn and then I lost sight.  Duration 3 seconds.;45.8946;-72.5421545851528
