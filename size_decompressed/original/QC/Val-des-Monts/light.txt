Object travaled In a straight line faster and brighter than any aircraft I've seen (almost as bright as the ISS which was visible In same area of sky SE from object), no flashing lights and very bright, jumped up and came down repeated up down and then faded away.  Just before object faded a shooting star fell from the path of the object. Funny thing It happend three(3) nights In a row,( I saw second/third night, a friend saw first sighting and I just happend to be at her plase for a campfire the next night) the third night too cloudy to see object but saw shooting star at same time same place.
