Illuminated lights and an oval shadow were cast on wall inside bedroom late at night. ((anonymous report));2020-02-24 13:00:00;10 seconds;Illuminated lights and an oval shadow were cast on wall inside bedroom late at night. I was awoken in the middle of the night by bright colored lights flashing against the wall above our closet (cathedral ceilings).  I laid in bed an opened my eyes to see the shape of the object reflected off the wall, which was oval with pointed ends and several round lights.  There was also a faint humming sound.  I was not scared, but it felt like, as soon “it” realized I was awake, it left instantly.  I didn’t even have time to sit up in bed, or run for my camera.  I had been in deep sleep, and was able to fall right back alseep (how odd).;45.6501;-75.666
