2 UFO geese formations over Canada;2007-01-13 18:40:00;45 sec;2 UFO geese formations over Canada I went to walk the dog. It was already dark and I looked into the sky.  It was a perfectly clear night without any clouds and I was so glad to see the stars.  After few seconds I noticed sort of two geese formations in the direction of Orion Constellation.  The first strange thing that I noticed was the fact that every goose in the formation kind-off glowed. There was a small formation of 5 or 6 objects in front and a larger formation behind of 10 to 12 objects. Every object glow very clearly in the dark sky making apparent the objectâ€™s chevron shape. There was no sound, no air tail, nor any other lights except the glow of each object. The traveling direction was from North-East to South-South-West. At the moment when I saw the objects they were on my left at aprox 45 degrees of my walking direction. In a split of a second my thoughts were: Gooses?  Now in January?  Impossible and anyway they would have been more like dark pots on the sky rather than glowing. What a heck it this?  During the next 15-20 seconds the 2 formations already passed the Orion Constellation and started to assemble themselves (in a goose like fashion) in a single formation. At that point I lowered my sight for no more than 10 seconds to check over my dog. When I looked again in the sky, the geese formation was this times on my right at aprox 45 degrees of the same walking direction. After 10-15 more seconds the formation was out of my sight. At that point I realized the incredible speed that these objects should have to be able to travel more than 90 degrees of the sky in less than 1 min. Continuing my walk with the dog, 2 to 3 min later I noticed a linear cloud or air tail following the direction of the geese formation.  The air tail seamed to move in the wind and after several minutes it was completely dissipated.;45.58404078341;-73.7514466589858
