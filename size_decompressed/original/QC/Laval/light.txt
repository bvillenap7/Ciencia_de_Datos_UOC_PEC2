A friend and I were walking back home on that night, at approximattely 1:15am.  We were both looking at the sky, cause Mars is easily observable these nights...Then, our look was captivated by a star-like light much brighter than the others, and it appeared quite nearer than the other stars... We starred at this light, it was standing still.  Then it started to move upwards, and at the same time, it started to faint, just like if it was moving away from us at a fast speed, until it became a very small spot and disapeared. We were both astonished and wondering if there were any reports made this night... Thanks for awering... ((name deleted));45.58404078341;-73.7514466589858
Two red lights suspend in the night.;2002-08-10 21:20:00;20 seconds;Two red lights suspend in the night. My brother, his girlfriend and I were on our way to see a movie.  I was sitting in the back seat of my brother's car.  We were driving South on the 15 in laval, when I saw two bright red lights towards the South East.  It was hard to see how high it was.  It seemed to be high enought from the ground, but it was too far away to be able to tell exactly how high.  It was kind of like two plane coming over the horizon far away...  I asked my brother and his girlfriend if they could also see the lights.  They just seemed to float there.  One was a little higher up than the other.  They didn't see them right away because we were moving and objects like trees and buildings kept getting in the way. Once they did see them they said it looked like fireworks, but wouldn't fade away.  It was a good description I guess.  You know when a flare goes up in the sky and glows bright red?  Well imagine the same glow, but bigger and brighter.  They just suspended there for about 20 seconds.  We past in front of an object (a bridge or building) and I lost them from view.  I looked for 5 minutes afterwards but I never saw them again.  I guess I can't rule out that they were flares, but they really didn't move any closer to the horizion like flares do, and it seemed to high to have been flares. Well that's what I saw tonight.  I wish I would have had a video camera!! ((FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE FROM WITNESS)) I know it doesn't make a big difference but I reported seeing two bright red lights in the sky over Laval last night but I believe that I wrote 08/11/02 instead of the actual date that I saw them which was 08/10/02.  Thank youâ€¦ ((name delted)) ((END MESSAGE));45.58404078341;-73.7514466589858
