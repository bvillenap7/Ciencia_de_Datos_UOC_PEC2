Two semi transparant spheres cross the night sky.;2014-03-31 21:20:00;4-6 seconds;Two semi transparant spheres cross the night sky. I was outside on my back porch having a cigar as i usualy do around this time, and i always look up towards the orion constelation towards the west and i saw what appeard to be another sattelite fly by but i soon realized that it was flying below the stars wich is unusual but appeard to be dim compared to what they are, almost see through then the second one caught my eye they were an open hand apart parrallel to each other.  As they were flying overhead from west to north east one of them, the one on the left changed it's coures towards the left, then sudenly it just arcd back to it's original spot and both zig zagd in the sky without crossing pathsuntil they just vanished.  The speres had a blueish white glow to them but yet transparant.  It reminded me of orbs that i've seen in pictures.  They crossed the sky from Orion to the northeast in about 4 to 6 seconds.  The size of the spheres i would say are as big as Sirus is in the night sky.;45.58404078341;-73.7514466589858
orange flying spheres;2015-09-26 23:15:00;2 minutes;Went outside, then saw 4 orange flying spheres in the sky, they moved very fast and were moving in a diamond formation until they later dispersed so they would disappear one by one (they disappeared: became transparent but we could still see them a bit).  Not an airplane, satellite,  etc.).  UFO.;45.58404078341;-73.7514466589858
