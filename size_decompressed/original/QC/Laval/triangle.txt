HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  The lights changed into the shape of a large triangular craft.;2003-10-13 22:20:00;approx: 3 minutes;The lights changed into the shape of a large triangular craft. I took a call from a witness who is living in Laval Quebec. He reported on October 13, 2003 that he was with his family driving back home on a very over cast night, with only a few stars shinning though some open patches through the cloud cover. He said it was so strange, he spotted two lights where he could see no stars shinning due to the cloud cover in the direction he was looking. As soon as he saw the two lights, another passenger in the car then noticed almost right away on his left side (drivers side) two more bright lights which appeared out of no where and were a little higher than the first two.  He mentioned that they drive by this same area almost everyday and have never notice seeing any lights before in this area  The witness also told me there is an electrical plant, I believe he meant a power sub station/transmission towers and the lights were sitting low over the power outlet. As they were watching, and making a left turn onto another road one of the passengers in the car said, the lights are moving.  They stopped the vehicle and started to watch. All of a sudden the lights changed, and in the witnesses words, they changed into the shape of a large triangular craft. All the lights which were first noticed were all white in color and one single red light at the bottom of the object in the middle. As mentioned above, he said the object was very low, he told me his best guess would have put the object some where around 200 meters off the ground and right above the power station/transmission towers. They observed the whole event for approx: 3 minutes.  As it started to move away from the area, it first would move slowly then picked up speed very rapidly and went out of their line of sight. The fellow told me this thing moved very easily, like sitting on a cushion of air.  The gentleman said, this was a life changing experience for him.  Thank you to the witness for the report.
