2 perfect apples appeared out of nowhere, 1 UFO encounter;2019-10-04 03:00:00;15 seconds;2 perfect apples appeared out of nowhere, 1 UFO encounter The adventure started when I quitted Victoriaville to drive my car I loved to drive. Minutes after quitting the city I saw a big light coming from the sky from far away like a city would do. I was curious what was that light as there was no other big city around. So I drive towards the light without GPS only following the Light. I drove for about 45 minutes. It turns out that the light was strawberry greenhouses. It was 3 AM I just arrived to this destination 302 Rue Water, Danville, QC J0A 1A0 only to take a brake. 1 minute before I arrived & stopped the car, I saw from my left side something bright appear in the sky making zigzag movements, so I started filming. As soon as I started filming, the UFO quickly went out of my field of view behind an electric pole. I started the car to try looking from another angle, and it was gone, or at least not bright anymore. I slowly went back home after this experience, it was my first encounter but surely not my first ! unexplained phenomena that happened to me.  I have a witness for my other strange thing that happened to me back in 2013-2014 before my father died. To make it simple, 2 perfect apples cleaner than any apples we can find and tastier appeared from I don't know where. There were to attach to the branches or a simple bush we had in our driveway. Every day, we pass by, and from one the to the other, 2 perfect red apples are there. When we showed to the parents they didn't believe, of course. If you, reading this can help me in any way I'm still looking for the reason and the meaning behind this. And we ate both apples as you can guess.  This is even more out of context, but I had very special dreams and experiences through my life. I will stop there, this is to report UFO'S, sorry if my English is not on point, I'm French. The phone I used from Apple in the period of time of the event is no longer in my possession, and I tried to connect myself to iCloud, but I can't. Which mean I no longer have the video, but anyway I was not even able to play the video! It was the only video on my cell phone that wouldn't read. All I had was a miniature of the video. If getting hands on that video is really important, I call Apple. Please note that I can only make and receive call within Quebec province. You can E-mail-me or text me or call me if you're close enough!;45.7885;-72.0156
