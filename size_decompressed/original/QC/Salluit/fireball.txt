Blue fireball seen by three children in arctic;1995-12-05 23:10:00;15-30 seconds;Blue fireball seen by three children in arctic One night my two friends and I were out late one night.  We were young, 11, 11 and 10 at the time.  It was a clear crisp night and we could see what seemed like millions of stars in the night sky, no clouds.  I looked northward of our community towards the other side of the bay.  Above the ice starting from around 200-300 feet in the air I saw a big blue fireball and told my friends to look.  It seemed to come from behind the west hill.    It travelled from west to east and didn't seem to make any noise, all the while descending.  It descended slowly, by the time it made it behind the east hill it looked to be about 50 feet in the air.  It travelled at about 20 kilometers an hour, very slow.   We watched it for about 15-30 seconds.  It then disappeared behind the east hillside.   I waited to hear a big bang so to speak but there was none.  Even with my child logic, I was expecting to hear it hit hard and maybe even shake the ground a little bit, but nothing happened.   After that we decided we better go home.
