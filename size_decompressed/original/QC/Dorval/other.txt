I was about to close the drapes when over the water (I live beside a large River nameed the St - Laurent, I noticed a phenomenal light formation in the air. I knew right away that this was a type of craft I had never seen before in my life. It was bright and shun with three round lights. From the outline I assume it was triangular. Within 5 seconds of looking at it I made no hesitation and grabbed my sony digital camera out of my desk droor. I remembered the batteries were almost dead and hoped I had enough to snap the shot. I turned on the Camera and Snapped the picure. When i went to snap another one the camera shut off. I observed it for about 15 seconds longer when all of a sudden it took of twords the left so quickly that when i turned my head to follow it, it was just as if it dissapeared out of mid air. Honestly for all i know, whatever it was, it just might have. Please Email me so i can send the image.;45.4424867924528;-73.7775320754717
