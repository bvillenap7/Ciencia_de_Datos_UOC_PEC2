Circular bright coloured sphere was seen very clearly above houses in small native community 1000 Kil. northeast of Montreal;2000-07-24 22:26:00;several seconds;Circular bright coloured sphere was seen very clearly above houses in small native community 1000 Kil. northeast of Montreal I am reporting this incident for others in the Sept-Iles area.  They don't speak English - only Montagnais/Innu (local native language) and French.  I haven't seen the recorded images other than the one that I am forwarding with this message.  It was sent to me by ((name deleted)), who witnessed this event.  I have known him for 30 years, he used to be a native policeman.  His description of the event seems factual and his observations very precise and without hesitation.  Personnally, I tend to think that alot of these sightings have to do with atmospheric gases and northern lights type phenomena.   ((name deleted)) wanted me to pass this info on to anyone who might be interested.  If you have a french speaking member, he should get a response from him.  I was told that the recorded video is still in the possession of one of ((name deleted)) neighbours.  My description is not very good, because I wasn't there. His Email is ((address deleted));50.2048613636363;-66.382740909091
