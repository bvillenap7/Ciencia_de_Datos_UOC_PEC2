Fast moving white light in the distance;2000-07-26 00:00:00;10 to 20 min.;Fast moving white light in the distance I was sleeping when all of a sudden i woke up to see a small white light flying around in the distance outside my window. It made very fast movements, it just kept going around in circles until all of a sudden it stoped. At first i thought i was just seeing things. I had to go to the bathroom so i went to the downstairs of my house to go to the bathroom. when i came back up o my room i looked outside of my window and the light was still their, but it was lower than it was before and it kept descending until i fell back to sleep.;45.0528;-74.1034
