So i said to my neighboor(voisin), who was there at the same time,at the back of the house,what was it a saucer?,and he answer me, one thing is for sure , it wasn't a plane.  I only wanted to make sur,that i was not going barzuk (fou).  anyway,for since, i donT laugh anymore to peoples that tell me their story.  Now, please forgive my writings, iam making a big effort here, (i usually,speak and wright in molliere language)  thank's for gaving me the opportunity to tell that stuff!  au-revoir.;46.0809;-73.1736
