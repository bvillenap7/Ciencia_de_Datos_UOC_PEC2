5 sec fireball over canadian lake;2012-06-14 21:00:00;5 seconds;5 sec fireball over canadian lake Hi guys,last Thursday,while coming back from fishing trip,at 2100,we saw a light in the sky going from east to west,a fireball that to me did not look like a meteor.it was a lot wider and after 4-5 sec. It seems to have disintegrated as it went to the west..it was white only.this sighting was on lake kipawa in the province of Quebec close to the Ontario border.the nearest town would be  TEMISCAMING,Quebec …my friend never seen stuff like this but I am very familiar with meteors as I watch the perseids and the leonids every year…like I said,this thing was wide!!…and the funny thing is,I listened to coast to coast that night and sure enough,george mentioned it at the opening of the show..;46.7167;-79.0833
