To the left of the object was a misty cloud, in our picture there is four beings as to which they do not resemble human beings. the color of the objest was a light blue and and the other beings were a white cloud with black and gray markings. We have seem photos of apparent ufo’s and pictures of apparent “aliens” and what we see in the photo that was taken  resembles most photo’s.  upside down teardrop shaped lenses with a misshaped head.  Myself I am enlisted in the Canadian armed forces and have a hard time believing in the “other life form” but as for now due to what we have seen  I am no longer a sceptic.. we have witnesses and photo's of the event and want to share them with the world.. I hope you understand And thank you for you consideration  sir;48.3738220338983;-71.2983559322034
