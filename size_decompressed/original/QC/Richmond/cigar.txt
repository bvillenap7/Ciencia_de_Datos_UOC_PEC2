Daylight sighting of a white, cigar shaped object.;2003-07-09 14:15:00;2 min;Daylight sighting of a white, cigar shaped object. Beautful blue sky with a few medium size thick fluffy white clouds. I was facing west when I was looking at the clouds and noticed what appeared to be a cigar shaped white object, with flattened/straight ends, slowly flying westward. I first noticed the object when it was over head and about the 1:00 position. I watched it for about 2 minutes against the blue sky before it disappeared in a cloud. I did not see it come out of the cloud as my viewing was blocked by buildings. I do not know if indeed it did go into the cloud or not as the clouds where white and the object was white so with the white background I could not see it anymore. Specially since the object was flying away from me and was much smaller. About the size of a bright evening star. As to it's size, if I were looking at a airline plane, that I would assume to be flying about the same altitude, I would say it was about half a plane longer. I could not see any wings or tail wing on the object and didn't hear any sound. If I held a dime at arms length when I first saw the object, the object would be about the same diameter. The object did not leave a contrail(?) behind it.;45.6649;-72.1306
