My friend said he saw the distance varying between the lights as it was moving , i did not.This happened on a cloudy night. We live close to the st-hubert airport and we are used to planes flying overhead but this was no airplane.The huge size of it, the abcence of noise ,and the shape resemble the description of this--> http://((URL deleted)).html. ps:has anyone seen unmarked helicopters flying very low that same month at the entrance of the victoria bridge?
