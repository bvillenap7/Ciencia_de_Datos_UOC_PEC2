At 00:01 on April 19th, I saw two low intensity orange lights distanced at about half an inch of each other.  No sound was heard coming from these objects.   They were travelling north at a speed exceeding a normal aircraft.  It lasted about 15 seconds from the time I spotted them to the time I lost them in the horizon.   This was spotted in the Mirabel airport area (Mirabel, Quebec, Canada).  The objects seen were definetly not satellites nor an airplanes.;45.6448;-73.8452000000001
