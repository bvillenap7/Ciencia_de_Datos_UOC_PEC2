This takes place in the dark of night. As I was driving my car into town my attention was drawn to an object in the sky with flashing lights  (red and blue, I think). I at first assumed that it was an airplane. Then I realized that it seemed to be slower and closer to the tree tops than I would expect from an airplane. There were no other cars coming so I stopped the car on the road and watched as the object seemed to stay in one place. There were  lights on it. I believe they were red and blue. They were flashing as they moved along the length of tubelike thing. I was just about to roll down my window so I could hear better when it took off very fast and smoothly with it's long edge forward. I watched as the lights  flashed across  the tube until it disappeared from my sight.;45.4655;-74.1419
