V-shaped light formation;2002-12-27 23:30:00;5 seconds;V-shaped light formation First of all I just want to say that I would normally laugh at the witnesses on T.v. that would describe such an occurence.....and now I'm one of them.... I was just walking down the street tonight with a friend.....and for no apparent reason I looked up in the sky (which was clear by the way) and saw a formation of 5 V-shaped lights moving South flyingat roughly 3 kilometers above us.  We lost sight of it as it went around the rooftop of a nearby house.... There wasn't anyway that it could have been an airplane....the was no roar of an engine and besides, planes don't usually take that approach when landing or taking off at the airport (which is still a good 15 km's away). As I stated the lights we in a V-formation, slightly larger in size than the stars in the sky and were a dimmed yellow-ish color. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain semi-anonymous.  We presume the witness implies a location in the Province of Quebec.  We have amended the province designator above.  PD));45.4522;-73.8681
