Almost as if the fireball was shining in the sky as its shining glares slowly moved. The fireball seemed to have been hovering over lac St. Louis. It appeared to slowly descend diagonally at a 45 degree angle going East. Once it began to fizzle out another fireball/orb would appear in the exact same spot as where it first appeared and would do the exact same thing as the other fireball/orb once again. Also, as the fireball/orb was making itâ€™s descent it also seemed as if it was faintly giving off some sort of vapour trail behind it. This had gone on for at least 45 minutes.;45.4522;-73.8681
