No sound, came in V formation, than stay over us on a line formation, get in V again, take the air and dissapear. It was between 30 and 50 feet above us, no sound no light.  I saw the star moving again, this time the other person saw it too.  I have seen two others things in years, and I missed 3 hours in my life, the other person too.  We never been able to knew what's happened in this three hours.  That was in 84.  My grand mother and my mother have had very strange stories too, about red and green lights floating around the country house.  Or little hairy men scaring the horses, they associated that to evil spirit, and recite prays during the travel.  My grand mother told me it was always accompained by fire balls, that use to happen in 1920'.;45.4362;-73.1604
