Pulsating, emence light in Huntingdon QC;1987-04-15 02:00:00;4 minutes;Pulsating, emence light in Huntingdon QC I was awoke at approx 2AM to my window, where I witnessed a pulsating, expandable, retractable light that came down from across the street (this is a country setting, with a highway that cuts in the middle of the field) There was 1 car that passed by, just before the light came down. It hovered for a few seconds, then as if it saw me looking at it, it went straight for me, across the roads, through a fence, as I saw this, the wood from the fence glowed. The light was so bright, that I had to look away from the window. It then disapeared, and I spent the rest of the night terrified on my bed. This happened to me 23 years ago, and I have never, ever forgotten, even the smallest detail, and the fright i had. It was not a fast moving car with its highbeams on, there was no car there at the time i saw what i saw. This was not a dream. What i state i saw, really happened. I did not see aliens, all i saw was what appeared to be a flying object, that was surrounded by an emence, expanding light.
