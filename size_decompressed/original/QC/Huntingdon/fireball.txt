Yellowish/orange sphere seen overing from West to NNE.;2013-08-18 20:20:00;10;Yellowish/orange sphere seen overing from West to NNE Viewing conditions: Now clouds, near full moon and temperature 66 degrees. Object was seen coming from West going in the NNE direction.  It first appeared like a chinese lantern but normally they eventually fall after a few minutes. This sort of orange light seemed to sparkel a bit and keep on going higher and higer towards NNE.  I checked all possible overhead passes but can't find any that corresponds to this time with such magnitude which I evaluate at Mag -3 or -4.  Satellite Flybys's site mentions that Ariane and Idefix where actually coming accross my town but they mention Mag. 3,  I have been an amateur astronomy for years and the visibility of this object was as I mentionned close to Mag-3 or -4.;45.0955;-74.1727
