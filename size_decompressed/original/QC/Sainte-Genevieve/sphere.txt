3 white stars;2013-07-26 03:43:00;3min 02secs;3 white stars Every night between 03:30am and 04:00am, i end up outside on the balcony, smoking a cigarette with my girlfriend before going to bed.  Tonight was a special night, upon gazing at the sky and looking at both little and big dipper constellation and from the extremity of dippers was an object that appeared like a star but was moving rather fast, but, seem to be making pauses and then seem like it was bending time. When the first one got out of view, I was thinking to myself, I must be crazy, and kept to myself.  My girlfriend tells me next that she's seeing something that looks like a shooting star, when I turned around and looked it was the same shape star again on the same angle / using the same trajectory has the first one and was heading towards to same direction has the first one.  Went inside quickly to grab a digital cam, but must be one of them cheap ones, i couldn't get the object to appear on the camera.  I was upset, until i turned around again looking at the North-East and saw another one on the same flight path has the previous ones. I tried to contact the Montreal Airport to maybe try to get information on if it may be a flight path or corridor used for planes, but i wonder which plane and if a plane, why are they traveling at such a high altitude. I never saw a plane fly close to a star, pause in mid-air and pursue is course.
