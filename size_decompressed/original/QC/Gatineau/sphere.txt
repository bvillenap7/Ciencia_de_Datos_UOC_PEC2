We saw a sphere, orange, traveling at great speeds, from south to east, and disappearing in the sky....last night (July 12, 2014 at 23:00hr)  We saw the same thing, but 5 sphere bright orange traveling from south and turning to east and appearing to be on the same flight path.... We were both outside in our backyard when we observed the phenomena.....we knew the object was the same type we saw a year ago....no doubt...every sphere appeared one at a time one after each other (not all together)....  we both asked each other what we were seeing and no doubt we were seeing the same thing.....  bright orange ball in the sky traveling at immense speed for the size and distance.....  very amazing.;45.4705410423455;-75.7162438110753
