Bright orange lights above Ottawa / Gatineau;2008-01-01 01:30:00;25 minutes;Bright orange lights above Ottawa / Gatineau 6 bright orange lights appeared on the way back from Hull sector on the 148 west ward. Initially I thought they were from fireworks but they did not disappear for several seconds. They appeared to be planes flying in formation but movement was erratic. Lights moved around slightly and began to disappear after about a minute or two. Then three lights reappeared at about the same place and appeared to move northward to then disappear towards the east. I filmed one of them towards the end of the sighting.;45.4705410423455;-75.7162438110753
Very bright object flies straight up and disappears.;2013-08-29 21:00:00;a few seconds;Very bright object flies straight up and dissappears. On Thursday 29th of August, we went outside on our 8th floor balcony before going to bed as we always do, about 21:00.  My husband remarked that the stars were bright but that one in particular seemed very bright.  As we looked, the “star” which was bright white, shot straight up and disappeared into the sky.  The object was brighter than Venus and somewhat larger.  It was not lights from an aircraft as the colour and intensity was different, just like a very bright star.  It was about 45 degrees above the horizon and about 15 degrees east of due north. There is virtually nothing to the north of us and the street lights are “low light” which gives us a nice clear view of the stars and aurora when it is visible.  The placement of this “star” caught both of our attention at the same time and we both saw it shoot straight up and disappear at the same time.  We haven’t really seen anything quite like this in this location, although we see high and fast flying aircraft and some curious things from time to time, but this was just very obvious and completely different. I spent many years working on fighter aircraft in the USAF and as I said, we see some interesting lights and curious aircraft from time to time, but I know aircraft and how they fly and this was nothing like anything I have seen.;45.4705410423455;-75.7162438110753
Two separate lights touching each other, then one going in circle (up and down) quite fast.;2016-05-11 21:05:00;2-3 minutes;Two separate lights touching each other, then one going in circle (up and down) quite fast. On May 11 it was around 9:05 pm - looking southwest direction. I usually see many airplanes at the same  time in the sky but usually at a far distance from each other. Through one of my small windows saw what I thought was 2 airplanes - the usual flashing red light (on one side) and another color light.  What caught my attention is that one flew directly into the other one and then started flying in circle -  at quite a high speed.  There was another airplane (real one) further so I was able to compare the speed of the two - the one that had almost hit the other one was going at a much faster speed and did an oval shape circle - which a plane could not do!!  The whole thing lasted for a few minutes - and then both planes with the red light went out of my view. A while later I looked outside and was surprised to see fog (or so it seemed) going over the street light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
