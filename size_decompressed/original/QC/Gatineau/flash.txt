Flashes of neon/led-like blue that lasted a few seconds.;2009-12-26 19:30:00;10 seconds;Flashes of neon/led-like blue that lasted a few seconds. Right after having a family supper sitting at the dinner table which is alongside the patio door, we saw a neon/led-like blue flash that lit the whole backyard and beyond.  As if it was a blue flashlight that came from the sky.  That evening the weather was icy, wet snow.  No thunders or lightening.  The flash lasted for approx. 2-3 seconds each time.  Right after the first flash, I immediately thought a hydro transformer had blown from the electric post.  I looked at the transformer through the patio door and saw nothing of the sort.  No noise was heard.  A few seconds before the first flash, the kitchen table light blinked.  We counted at least 5 flashes with a few second intervals.  The first three flashes were seen in the backyard, another one farther left and another one that seemed to be on the side of the house. Ten to fifteen minutes later, my husbandâ€™s daughter had to leave to head back home.  While driving on the highway ramp, both my husband and daughter saw a huge blue flash coming down through a cloud.  The blue beam was not perfectly symmetrical.  It looked a bit wavy. We asked around and my son-in-law saw the same thing that day at a different time.;45.4705410423455;-75.7162438110753
