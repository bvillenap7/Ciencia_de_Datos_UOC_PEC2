Something with bright red lights just zoomed by my window in the sky. ((anonymous report));2016-06-16 21:45:00;seconds;wow! amazing Wow - something with bright red lights just zoomed by my window in the sky.  About 9:45 pm looking out my window something went by so fast - red lights - I guess if I had to say it had a bit of a upside down teardrop (thanks for the choices on the side) -  I'm not good at measuring height but I guess I'll have to say it was flying as low as what a small plane normally flies - but it was the speed!  No way that was an airplane.... Leave you feeling shaking inside - it's so unbelievable.... I guess there was about 5 lights - it happens so fast - you kind of go in shock!  This is the second time for me within a few months - what's going on??  but last time it wasn't like this - this was much closer.
