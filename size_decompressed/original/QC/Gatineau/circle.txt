UNNEXPLAINED ARC FORMATION IN NIGHT SKY;2006-09-01 22:00:00;2 minutes;UNNEXPLAINED ARC FORMATION IN NIGHT SKY As I went outside for a cigarette, I noticed 3 large orange colored lights in an arc formation travelling East to West. My first thought was that they may be hot air baloons. But the night was very quiet and I could not hear the sound of the gas burners which are usually heard. The formation and movement was also to perfect. Over the span of approx. 2 minutes, each light fadded until the last one. I unfortunatly was only able to videotape the last light (30 second tape).  I will be checking with local authorities and medias to confirm similar sitings or reports.;45.4705410423455;-75.7162438110753
Orange ball of light seen by a family.;2013-05-24 23:00:00;5 minutes;Orange ball of light seen by a family. Me and my family were outside when suddenly, as if out of nowhere, a circular ball of orange light appeared in the sky. There was only one. At first it was going straight, then it changed it's course and went in a different direction. It was like looking at a small ball of fire, the light wasn't blinking or anything, just a solid orange color flying across the sky very slowly.  It made no sound whatsoever, it was silent.  It wasn't moving fast at all either, it maybe lasted at least 5 minutes before it suddenly disappeared, as if it blinked out of existence. The weather was very cloudy and windy, the clouds were very high up, but we saw this thing as clearly as if the sky was clear.  It was like looking at a light bulb, but a very dark orange color that seemed to glow like a street lamp - that kind of color.;45.4705410423455;-75.7162438110753
