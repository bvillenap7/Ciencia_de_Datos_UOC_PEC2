Object with three red lights coming down;2010-09-26 20:25:00;2-3 minutes;Object with three red lights coming down Last night I saw a (horizontal) flat oval shape object in the sky at approximately 20:25 in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada.  I was driving my car when I saw something bright and red in the dark sky.  At first I thought it might be a flare falling down but it was shifting to my right and it had two smaller red lights under a bigger one and it was moving and descending steadily to my right.  At that point I knew it was not a flare. Then as I got in a curve, I lost it for a while behind houses.  I accelerated a bit and it was there again. I took the road to my right because it was going down and I didn’t want to lose it again. It was still coming down in front of me as I was accelerating more.  It was dark and I had problems estimating the distance and the size of the object but it seemed big.  In front of the road I was on, there is a field and a little forest behind it. The object was then partially blocked by trees and when I didn’t see it anymore, I saw a lot of ! red light strings coming upwards through the trees. I stopped my car and tried to see what was there but I didn’t see anything.  Everything went very fast and I think it lasted about three minutes.;45.4705410423455;-75.7162438110753

I  quickly realized it wasn't a plane since there was zero emissions. I looked down to continue driving (bumper to bumper traffic) and after maybe 2 seconds, I looked back up and the object was nowhere to be found.;45.4705410423455;-75.7162438110753
