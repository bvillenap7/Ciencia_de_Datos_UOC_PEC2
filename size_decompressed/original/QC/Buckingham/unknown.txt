The Full Story. Me and my brother were fishing at McFalls Creek for Pike in Buckingham.Quebec. When we noticed a red light reflecting on the pond from overhead. It was very dark and the object displaying the light was not visible. Two fighter jets came from the East and flew very quickly overhead. The sky was bright with stars. Again to the East some kind of object was releasing a sphere shaped object. It was a very clear night. It was frighting because the red glow on the pond startled us. I have waited this long (November 26th,2000) to report this case because I have just recently read about a UFO abduction case in Buckingham over the WWW. I swear that this statement is absolutely true.;45.588;-75.4191
