Suddenly, a blueish light sphere in the sky cought my eye. At first sight, I thought it was a planet because it was so bright, but I then noticed it was moving slowly so I started eliminating the facts of what it couln't be.  Fact 1- Even though it was as bright as Venus or possibly more, it couln't be a planet, because it was moving.  Fact 2- Air planes flew by higher up in the sky, so its altitude suggested it definatly couln't be the space station or a satilite.  Fact 3- Comparing it to a plane or hellicopter, their were no flashing lights on its sides, or under it, or over it. Just a bright white ball of light.  Fact 4- No sound was coming from it. At that altitude, about that of a small plane, or hellicopter, I would have been able to hear sound coming from it, yet there was none.  Fact 5- As it passed over me and headed away from me, the bright light/sphere simply faded away after about 30 seconds.  Fact 6- It couldn't have disapeared into the thin clouds in the distance, cause it wasn't high enough. Plus I could see faint stars through those clouds, so I would have been able to see the object very clearly. I was able to see the light sphere for about 20-30 seconds at most.  What was interresting too is that during 14 minutes after the sighting of the light sphere, I saw two satellights and a shooting star near the constellation Cassiopeia. I also saw a dot (like the appearence of a satellite) at the altitude of a satellite traveling about twice as fast as the previous satellite I saw a second ago. I'm wondering if this could be a UFO aswell.  Let me know what you think about my sighting and if anyone has seen similar objects.
