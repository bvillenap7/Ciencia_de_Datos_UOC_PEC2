Driving in the country roads;1998-12-14 00:00:00;1-2 sec;Driving in the country roads Me and my borther were driving in the back country roads, just looking at the stars.  As we were returning home, we both the brightest flash of white/blue color light that we have ever saw.  The shape of the object we could not see, but there were not houses, or lights of any type to make a mistake of.  We saw the object light up, zigged in the sky super fast, then shot straight down.  The object did hit the ground.  The ligh was white, until it shot stright down (blue light then)  It seemed to, I guess burn up.. as the object was going down, and changed to the blue color it faded out, or burned up.  Wharton is a country town, there is no airports.. and it shot to fast to a mistaken as an airplane, or anything made by man.;29.3198;-96.0812999999999
