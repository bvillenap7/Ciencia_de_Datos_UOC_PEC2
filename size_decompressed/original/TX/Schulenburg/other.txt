One object, or 4 flying if perfect formation, traveling west to east, at 23:42 on 4/18/12.;2012-04-18 23:42:00;2 seconds;One object, or 4 flying if perfect formation, traveling west to east, at 23:42 on 4/18/12. The sighting consisted of an object, or 4, traveling from dead west to east at about 2:00 (just right of center).  The shape of it, or the formation was 2 lights in front, and one on either side and behind the two in front. It took the object, or 4, to enter my sight and leave (west to east) about 2, maybe 3 seconds.  I never saw a body, just 4 lights, and if it was 4 objects, they were traveling in a drop dead PERFECT formation.  Each light was the size of a normal sized star, no blinking or multi-color,... just the color of a normal star.  It, or they, made no sound. FYI: If you sit outside here for approximately 1 hour on any given night, you'll see at least 1 shooting star, meteror, or whatever,...traveling at about 60,000MPH (if you blink your eyes,...you'll miss them).  Sure is a lot of stuff flying around out there.  What's amazing is that i can only see the maybe 1/10th of the sky i'm focusing on at any given time,...when you see one,...it's like WOW!!!;29.6898;-96.9109
