Approximately 40 objects traveling in an umbrella shaped formation from northwest to southeast at what appeared to be supersonic speed.  The objects were white, and traveled in PERFECT formation.  The formation would almost exactly resemble one which ducks travel in, but the exact formation and speed rules them out.  It took the formation 3 seconds to enter and leave horizon.  There was no sound.;29.6898;-96.9109
