I was walking down the street talking with some friends and i decide to look up to the stars which is something i normally do when im outside.   i saw a circle/oval shape that seemed larger than the other stars and i mentioned it to my friends. when i pointed it out the circle then started to come down from the sky to the ground.  I could say that the drop looked 100% similar to when the ufo drops in the video of Jerusalem UFO it had the same pace and straightness of when hovering from the sky to the ground.  Many ufo sightings have been happening in my area according to wallpostings i see on facebook ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
