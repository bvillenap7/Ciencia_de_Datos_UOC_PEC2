At approximately 6:30 PM or so on Tuesday, October 27, 2009, a friend and I were working outside on a project for school. We were underneath a d√©cor tarp, which blocks sunlight. I happened to look up and see an object shining brightly in the sky. My first guess was that it was the moon, but after stepping out of the tarp, it was actually some sort of aircraft. There were two of them, flying apart at a distance and moving extremely slow. There was no roar of an engine in the air, and I could not see any wings. In a blue and clear sky, it looked like the aircraft had a type of mini cloud around it, or it was flying surrounded by clouds, but the sky was clear. It was also emitting an extremely bright light, enough to project enough shine like the moon. They eventually moved out of sight.;26.2247961095099;-98.2308958213253
