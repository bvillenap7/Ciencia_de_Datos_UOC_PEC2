McAllen White Orb Sightings;2007-03-05 12:10:00;10 Minutes;McAllen White Orb Sightings I was jogging near the airport in south Mcallen around mid-day, when I noticed a bright white object in the sky (the sky was perfectly clear and blue that day). Anyway the one object became 4 and the moved in and out of a V formation (covering about 1/4 of a mile in their wanderings).   Interestingly a white Cessna was moving directly at them at what looked like exactly the same altitude.  Once the cessna was about a couple of hundred yards from them, they regrouped in a V formation, and the formation became a light red and then they all disappeared from view (almost as the Cessna was on top of them and within a few seconds of changing color).  Estimated altitude of Cessna and objects was 1500 feet.  All of this occurred within one mile directly East of the McAllen Control Tower. About ten minutes later I continued my jogging and noticed one object had reappeared now direcltly over the airport. This lasted five minutes or so, and there was no sightings after that. I wonder if the McAllen Control Tower or the Cessna pilot saw anything.  By the way I am pilot myself and could not identify the objects.;26.2247961095099;-98.2308958213253
