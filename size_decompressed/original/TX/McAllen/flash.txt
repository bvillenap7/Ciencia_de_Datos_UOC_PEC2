saw a blinking object in the sky;2009-09-06 22:30:00;3-4 minutes;I was outside my house, when I looked up and saw a blinking object in the sky, I thought it was a satellite of some kind, I continued monitoring the object, it amazed me on how it moved faster than a plane, but not as fast as a shooting star, there was instances where it would blink and and it seemed it was shooting projectiles of soft light, after it would do this, it seemed it duplicated its image to 3 side by side, than for some reason it stayed in one position as if it knew I was watching it, and than disappeared.;26.2247961095099;-98.2308958213253
