2 unidentified objects in the sky in South Texas;2020-10-31 00:00:00;4 hours;2 unidentified objects in the sky in South Texas On October 31, 2020 I took out my telescope to look at the Blue moon on Halloween night along with other planets. There was this “star” that kept shining different colors. Blue, purple, red, green, orange and so on. It was stationary to the southeast of my apartment. I pointed my telescope to this object and zoom in on my camera and behold it was changing different shapes and would burst into a sphere, chevron, disk-like. Several times within this time I would hear dogs barking out in the neighborhood south of my apartment. This wasn’t the first time I have seen this multicolored object.  The second object I encountered was south of me, I thought it was a star until I zoomed in. It was a disk like and I caught a video of lights flashing across the saucer. There was just white lights on it.;26.2247961095099;-98.2308958213253
