The craft was about a meter wide and sphere shaped.  It was a dull tiel color that almost seemed translucent.  I saw it with my nieghbor and we followed it on foot for mabey 45 seconds to a min. before it disappeared behind some trees.  We then decided to look for the craft by car.  We must have driven around the area we saw it in for about half an hour, but we never saw it again.  I can definalty say that the craft moved in jerking movments side to side and up and down while heading in an eastern direction.  It didnt seem to move until we started to pursue it on foot and thats when it started moving away from us.  The craft seemed to be lingering close to the power lines in the ally of our nieghborhood.  At first we thought it was a balloon but very quickly realized that it was not.  The whole experiance was chilling.;26.2247961095099;-98.2308958213253

I took my food into the house and returned with a set of binoculars.  The craft had moved about 10-degrees in just a few minutes and was stationary (in a roughly 15-mph wind).  Viewing through the binoculars revealed a very bright silver sphere at roughly 2,000 feet. I did not have a hard time focusing on it as it was completely stationary (clouds were flowing by it at a good clip).  Anyway after about 5-minutes of viewing the craft seemed to go into a cloud. The odd thing was there seemed to be some sort of other strange shaped object in the cloud (though not at all well defined).  Both disappeared and no further sightings.
