Green ball of  light  falling from the sky(completely vertically down);2012-10-03 23:58:00;5-10 seconds;Green ball of  light  falling from the sky(completely vertically down) Between the time of 11:55 of 10-3-2012 and 12:05 of 10-4-2012, a green ball of light was falling vertically.  A friend was driving and i was riding passenger in the front. I had the window rolled down and looked to my right, when i saw this big green ball of light falling straight down.  I didn't think it was a meteor or a comet, due to the light not having a tail or traveling semi-horizontally.  It lasted about 5 to 10 seconds dropping behind trees and apartment complexes 2 to 3 stories high.   It looked similar to roman candle flare but bigger and consistent and did not fade out, like a fire cracker would.  It was much too high in the air to be from a fire cracker.   Within 30 seconds after, a helicopter came flying from the south as we were pulling into my neighborhood.  It circled my neighborhood about and passed my street, about 2 more streets down flying pretty low.  Then i saw it go straight to the neighborhood where I saw the green ball of light fall.  Then i! t left.   I contacted the local news the next afternoon to inquire if anyone has reported anything.  It's been 3 days and I haven't gotten a response.;26.2247961095099;-98.2308958213253
