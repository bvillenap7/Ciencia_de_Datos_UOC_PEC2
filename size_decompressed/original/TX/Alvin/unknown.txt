Craft with color changing lights.;2014-10-15 21:45:00;15 minutes;Craft with color changing lights. Objects were stationary for approx. 15 minutes.  They blinked a white light, then an orange light, then a red light, repeating this pattern continuosly for 15 minutes.  They were approx. 10 miles from my location and approx. 8 miles apart.  There is a tower right down the road from me that usually has a rapidly pulsating white light atop it, but tonight it was a slowly pulsating red light, thereby allowing me to see the craft better.    After about 15 minutes, both craft disappeared.;29.4085;-95.2498999999999
