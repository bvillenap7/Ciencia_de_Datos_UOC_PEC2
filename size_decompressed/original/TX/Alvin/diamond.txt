DRIVING TO WORK AT 05:30, GOING WEST ON HWY-35 TOWARDS PEARLAND, TX...I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A METEOR GOING FROM SOUTH TO NORTH THROUGH MY CAR WINDSHIELD. THE METOR STREAKING  GOT MY ATTENTION, AN ALL OF AT ONCE IT STOPPED AND STARTED FLASHING SILVER LIGHT ONLY ONE LIGHT AND MOVING TO THE NORTH AT A FASTER RATE THEN AN AIRLINE AND THEN OUT OF SIGHT.  I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON AND AROUND AIRCRAFT FOR FOURTY-TWO YEARSâ€¦  THE ONLY CRAFT THAT COULD DO THIS WOULD BE NASA SPACE SHUTTLE RACING ACROSS THE SKY TO FLORDIA, WHICH I HAVE SEEN TWICE.;29.4085;-95.2498999999999
