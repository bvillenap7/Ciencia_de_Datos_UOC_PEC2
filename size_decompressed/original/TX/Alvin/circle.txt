At the same attitude from where it stopped, it makes a ninety -degree turn and heads north and disappears.  Nothing in our inventory can take G-Forces like that… without coming apart.   I didn’t need a cup of coffee that morning, but maybe a drink!;29.4085;-95.2498999999999

When it got midway in the sky they separated, my son was with me at the time as we got closer it seem what appear to us that it might be bombs coming to us.  The colors were orange, green, red it was just unreal.  As they got closer down to earth they stop and we notice five unidentify white flying objects.  We were unable to capture the whole phenomenon, however we do have a video, along with pics of what we were able to get.;29.4085;-95.2498999999999
