Red and green object with noise that made a thumping noise when it hit the ground.;2007-08-27 17:30:00;20 seconds;red and green object with noise that made a thumping noise when it hit the ground. This object was probably a meterorite because it fell in a field and is still there. Out side the city limits north of the main road that goes into town. It fell north of the intersection of Johnson and Rosharon road.  It's a cow pasture and there are not alot of homes in this area.   My wife says that its big about the size of a small compact car. ((NUFORC Note:  We question the report, but we have no solid evidence to either support, or repudiate, the report.  A meteor the size of an automobile would have attracted the attention of others for thousands of miles in all directions.  PD));29.4085;-95.2498999999999
