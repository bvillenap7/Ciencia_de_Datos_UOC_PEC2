Saw an oval shaped saucer with dark hull covered in lights.;1999-09-11 19:00:00;1 minute;Saw an oval shaped saucer with dark hull covered in lights. To my best recollection, this event happened on the night of 9/11/99, around 7:00-7:30 pm.  I was 15 at the time and my mother was driving me to my dance class in a local town (we live in a rural area around it).  We had barely left home and were driving down the dirt road.  It was fully dark by now, and I don't think the moon was out that night. We were having a casual conversation, when I looked out the window to my right (direction was north)  I must have looked at exactly the right time, because I barely had to turn my body to see the amazing object travelling alongside the car.   From the ground it was about 35-40 degrees up, and couldnt have been more than 50 to 60 feet from the car.  It was close enough that I could see the outline of the dark surface against the sky, and it had 4-5 orange-yellow lights covering the hull.  It must have been travelling around the same speed as the car, because it seemed stationary even with our motion. (we were travelling east) The oval-saucer shaped object stayed alongside us for about a minute or so, then quickly the lights dimmed and it dissapeared as fast as it had came.   I ended up telling the story to my mom about 2 years later, since I have seen strange occurances off and on since then.  Most of these occured in the fall/winter months.
