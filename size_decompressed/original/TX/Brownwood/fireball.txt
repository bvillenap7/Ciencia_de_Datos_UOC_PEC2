Fireballs sighted near Lake Brownwood Texas;2012-05-03 21:00:00;1-5 minutes;Fireballs sighted near Lake Brownwood Texas In early May of 2012, in the evening just after sunset, my husband and I witnessed two fireballs in the sky near lake Brownwood Texas.  The fireballs were near Hwy 279 and were just above the tree tops and not moving in any direction.   I dismissed them and went inside my home because I thought them to be the exhaust from a jet but there was no sound of a jet.     About a half hour later, I witnessed fireballs closer to the lake and lower to the ground since I had to look through the trees to see them, still unmoving and still no sound.  I did not watch them so I donâ€™t know how long they were in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));31.77505625;-98.9921125
