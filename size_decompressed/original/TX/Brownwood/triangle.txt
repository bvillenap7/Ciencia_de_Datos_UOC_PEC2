Yes there were indeed lights in the sky last night. My husband, I and two boys had to run to Brownwood last night from Bangs to get something to eat at a local fast food chain. My husband waited in the car while the boys and I ran inside to place a order. When we came out to the car, my husband said look there are lights in the sky, it looks like a UFO. I said yea right..He said no really, look over there. I looked up and noticed the most amazing thing. The lights appeared and vanished. Then further away, they appeared and vanished again. I was totally shocked. My boys noticed the lights as well. My husband said that while we were inside the fast food chain, he had saw the lights first appear over Walmart, and it did the same pattern 3 times while we were inside. The appearing and then vanishing on 3 different occasions. I could not believe what I was seeing, because I am normally a very skeptical person, and I saw it with my own eyes. The first time I noticed the lights they were between Home Depot and Walmart, and the second time I saw them they were over the Home Depot store. We tried to drive back behind the store in the direction that the lights were headed, but did not see them again...My son tried to record the lights on his cell phone, but the guard lights around Home Depot was putting a glare on his phone. I just wanted to respond to this, because I know that I saw them, and I am so glad someone came forward to talk about this. I had told my husband last night, to contact someone, but he said no one would believe the story without pictures. I am convinced there was something going on last night.;31.77505625;-98.9921125
