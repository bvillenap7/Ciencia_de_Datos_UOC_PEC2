I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME.;2005-10-15 01:00:00;8 MINUTES;I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME. WALKED OUT ON FRONT PORCH TO SMOKE CIGARETTE APPROX 1AM AND OBSERVED 7 ODDLY SHAPED LIGHTS OVERHEAD.  I STOOD LOOKING AT THE NIGHT SKY NOT BELIEVING WHAT I WAS SEEING.  THE ODD SHAPED OBJECTS LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE PLAYING CHASE WITH EACH OTHER AS I WATCHED.  THE LIGHTS WOULD GO ON AND OFF IN PATTERNS AND AS SOON AS THEY FINISHED EACH PATTERN THEY CHANGED FORMATION.  BEFORE DARTING OFF AT A SPEED IVE NEVER WITNESSED THEY MADE A VERY STRANGE SOUND.  NO SOURCE OF PROPULSION WAS NOTICED.  THERE WAS A SMELL IN THE AIR AFTERWARDS WAS BREATHTAKING. COULDNT SEE COLOR BECAUSE OF THE NIGHT SKY........... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  We believe that advertising lights would have to be ruled out as a possible explanation, before we could conclude that the witness observed a genuine UFO.  PD));30.1547;-95.1992
