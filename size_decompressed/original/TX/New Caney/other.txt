Strand of orange lights travel over Wal-Mart parking lot in New Caney Texas;2021-08-12 22:06:00;5 seconds;Strand of orange lights travel over Wal-Mart parking lot in New Caney Texas While walking out of Wal-Mart tonight I looked up and saw 6-8 orange lights all in a perfect row evenly spaced out kind of fading in and out, hard to explain exactly but it was like I was looking at something that I wasn't supposed to see, like it was glitch in the system and I got a glimpse of it. Almost looked like an electrical current of some sort but as soon as I saw it, it faded away. I don't think it had aliens in it or anything like that because it was too small, it wasn't like a spaceship. Kind of reminded me of the flashing lights in a school zone at least that was the shade and light consistency. Best example I can try to explain the shape of it is this. Imagine a hockey puck, now stack about 8 hockey pucks on top of each other, (the same way you would stack cans of tuna) except make them significantly larger like 8 in diameter and 8 thick stack them on top of each other, then lay the stack down horizontally and space all the pucks out! evenly about 6 apart and instead of them being pucks they were orange lights. Not the best visual description but that's how it looked and then it was gone into nowhere. It was almost like the lights were passing through an invisible conduit from one side of the sky to the other. ;30.1547;-95.1992
