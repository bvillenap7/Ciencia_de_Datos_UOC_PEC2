Orange fireball slowly floats across the night sky.;2012-07-05 00:45:00;20 seconds;Orange fireball slowly floats across the night sky. Wednesday night/ Thursday morning I was leaving for work and noticed an orange glowing ball float across the sky.  No noise was heard.  It was heading toward the northeast on a straight path until it was no longer visible behind the treeline. Fireworks were being set off at the time, however, I can say with near 100% certainty that this was not a firework.  The object had the appearance of a translucent bag with moving flames inside. Size/distance are hard to judge, but I would guess at least 2000 feet up and over 10 feet in diameter.;30.1547;-95.1992
