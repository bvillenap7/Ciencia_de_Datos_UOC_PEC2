Strange moving star like object seen in Vidor Texas.;2013-01-30 19:05:00;1 minute;Strange moving star like object seen in Vidor Texas I was standing on my back porch talking on the phone and looking at the stars.  When I noticed what I thought was a star, orbiting another star.  It started out above the star and moved around it until it was below it.  The unknown object stopped, and then started moving south while increasing in brightness and in size. There is no way it was an air plane.  I was in awe. I ran to the back door of my house to call my husband out to see.   I quickly returned to the spot I was standing and the object had moved to the right.  It shined ever brighter than the first time and disappeared before my husband could see.  I stood there for 15 minutes hoping to see it again but had no luck.  What was that?!;30.1475176470587;-93.9984915966389
