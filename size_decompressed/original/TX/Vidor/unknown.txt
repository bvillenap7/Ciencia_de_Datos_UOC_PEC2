i believe i was abducted almost directly in front of my home.;1994-11-10 23:00:00;2 hours;i believe i was abducted almost directly in front of my home. I was walking down the street to my home when i was a boy and all of the sudden a bright light hit me and i froze and the next thing i remember was that i was terrified running as fast as i could to my home though it seemed farther than where i was before when i got home my mother yelled at me that i was two hours late.  Upon later inspection (i was in the shower) i noticed that i had a new scar of a triad of dots in the shape of a triangle in my armpit the whole event has been surpressed in my memory until recently i started to have dreams about the things that may have happened to me during those two hours.  among those memories or dreams is distinctly tall and petite figures/sillouettes standing all around me in a bright and cold room.  this is the first ive ever spoken this to anyone and I am a very skeptical person by nature but what happened that night is beyond anything that I have seen in this world.;30.1475176470587;-93.9984915966389
Star Like Craft;2012-12-24 06:20:00;3 minutes;I walked outside this morning and looked in the darkness of the sky and looked at the stars as I always do hoping to see some kind of alien object, and finally this morning I seen one of those stars start to move and thought it was just a meteor or satalite.  This star like craft was moving at a high rate of speed and gained speed as me and my wife watched it go by.  This moment has been checked off my bucket list.;30.1475176470587;-93.9984915966389
