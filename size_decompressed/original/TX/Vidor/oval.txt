3 objects seen in Vidor, TX.;2014-05-31 04:44:00;2 hours;3 objects seen in Vidor, TX. The flickering of a bright light on our home surveillance monitor woke me & my husband.  At first, we thought someone had a flashlight until we realized if it were anyone they would have to be on the roof.  My husband sat in my car and to him, it stayed pitch black. When he watched how bright this light focused on him and lit up the entire inside of the car, he freaked out.  It couldn't be seen with the naked eye.   I videoed the 3 objects in the sky forming a triangle.  The lights were green, red, and white.  They moved extremely erratic, with no obvious pattern.  They moved extremely fast in the sky.  It was hard to keep them in the line of sight for the camera. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report does not indicate a date.
