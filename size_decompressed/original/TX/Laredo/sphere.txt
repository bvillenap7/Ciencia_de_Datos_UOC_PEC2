We had just finished playing a soccer match and we were laying on the grass.  one team player sighted up high in the sky a metallic sphere.  It was just hovering at very low speed, moving in a southern direction towards Mexico.  Even though it was bright and sunny we could see how it changed color several times it went from a silver metallic color to a bright white back to metallic.  it moved very slow for about 25 minutes until suddenly it just moved at a very fast speed in a straight southernly direction and vanished.;27.5567179591844;-99.4987245408168

As its very common to hear and see planes because I live very close to the airport, this sphere and orange light wasn't noisy, just steady moving.   It got so much my attention that I tried to take a photo but as it was on motion it didn't come out right. The remarkable orange sphere moved in a single direction until it continued its flight until I lost sight. It was the first time I have seen that. I live in an area with clear sky and 2 weeks ago saw a shooting star.;27.5567179591844;-99.4987245408168
