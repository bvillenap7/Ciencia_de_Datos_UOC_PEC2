Spinning circular black UFO with changing lights.;1979-06-01 16:00:00;30 min;Spinning circular black UFO with changing lights. When I was about 6 yrs old, my father, mother, sister, and myself were riding in the car heading towards a city park at about 5 pm in Laredo, Texas. My sister who at the time was 11, pointed towards the sky and said look at that, as I looked out her passenger side window I noticed a black circular disc, with changing lights, confused at what I was looking at, I asked my parents pointing to the sky, what kind of plane is that, my mother looked out her window and yelled at my father to stop the car. My father not having a clue as to what we were looking at slammed on the brakes. Looked out the window and asked my mother, is that a flying saucer? I remember the expression on my parents faces, they looked as if they had seen a ghost, more fear than confussion. They didn't get out of the car, let alone, allow us to get out, but we just stayed there looking at this thing in the sky, but it stayed still in that same spot, probably about half a block in front of us and 12 stories high, and it spinned at a very low pace, but it did have changing colored bright lights. Then it began to travel towards the park we were heading too so, i'm assuming curiousity from my parents, we followed it, and sure enough it hung around right above the park, at the same distance from us as we saw it earlier on the road. On the street it probably stayed up there for a good 15 minutes and then at the park for a good 20 to 30 minutes. Other people at the park were seeing this with us, and then it just slowly bega to go higher and higher until it vanished from sight, at this point it was getting darker, so the lights were visibly brighter. Then we left, talked about through the years, but recently I brought it, and for some strange reason, my parents nor my sister seem to remember this event, which makes no sense to me, because we talked about this happening through the years.But now no one seems to remember. And I know i'm not crazy, and I would not invent this in my head. I just wanted to report this because I wa! nted to see if anyone else had a similar experience like this. Thank you ............I am also submitting a sample drwaing of what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Illustration looks somewhat like a thick saucer, with different colored windows.

UFO sighted over U.S - Mexico border town.;2003-11-24 19:15:00;15 SEC;UFO sighted over U.S - Mexico border town. On 11-24-2003, at approximately 1920hrs, in Laredo, Texas a UFO was seen in the southwestern sky. The UFO seemed to be suspended in the sky in the vicinity of the Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, across the Rio Grande river from Laredo, Texas. The UFO was the shape of a circle and gave off a bright white glow, though not shiny or glaring. Several witnesses intitially confused it with an airplane on approach to Laredo International airport. However, the UFO´s glow suddenly intensified, with a slight light blue tinge, and it appeared to expand its diameter (this may have been the visual effect of the glow). The object then moved at an incredible rate of speed, at approximately a 45 degree angle upward and in a southwesterly direction into Mexico. And with a second burst of speed the object disappeared into the night sky. At approximately 1927hrs,  two aircraft flying in formation, coming from the northeast (possibly Kingsville Naval Air Station) and at a very high altitude followed the direction of the UFO´s flight path. These jets crossed into Mexican airspace. This event wss witnessed by 12 Federal Officers. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this individual via telephone, and found him to be quite serious-minded and credible.  PD));27.5567179591844;-99.4987245408168
