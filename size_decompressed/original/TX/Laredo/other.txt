Four  white lights chasing each other inside a cloud.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible advertising lights?  PD));2009-05-25 22:00:00;30 min.;Four  white lights chasing each other inside a cloud. On Monday May 25,2009 at approximately 9:00 P.M. the National Weather Service out of Corpus Christi, Tx. issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the Laredo area with possible tornado's.  I happen to live on the Eastern side of the city or just outside loop 20. By 10:00 P.M. much of the lightning and thunder had passed us by and only a few sprinkles remained.  While observing the weather conditions outside, I noticed a white puffy cloud immediately to the west of my location.  As I stared at this cloud, I noticed four white lights chasing each other within the cloud itself.   I immediately called my wife so she could witness what I was looking at.  I also called my brother who happened to be visiting family in the vicinity of Nixon High which is located NW of loop 20 from where I was.  He was able to see the same lights inside the cloud going around in a circular pattern.   I tried to apply all logic as to the origin of the lights.  There were no airplanes in the vicinity nor was there any beams of light coming from the ground up. The airport beacon light is approximately 2 miles from where this cloud was.  The lights seem to be chasing each other and never collided with each other.  At some point, the lights would come to a complete stop and would begin rotating in a counterclockwise pattern.  The best way to describe the lights is by imagining that your inside the cloud with a flash light and moving the light around or inside the cloud.  I could see where the light was hitting inside but the beam never broke through the wall of the cloud itself.   This sighting went on for approximately 30 minutes until the cloud moved out towards the East.  I am a law enforcement officer and I have never seen anything like this in my 26 years of service. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed.  We note that his description is not inconsistent with a four-element light advertising display, although we assume that the witness would have been witness to such a light display, during the course of his career in law enforcement.  We do not know what he witnessed.  PD));27.5567179591844;-99.4987245408168
