Large object producing a large bright stream of light dissapear from the sky  like a flash !!!;2009-01-27 21:50:00;1 minute;Large object producing a large bright stream of light dissapear from the sky  like a flash !!! My daughter & I were driving home last night, 01/27/2009.  It was close to 10 pm in the north area of Laredo, TX.   As we turn south in one of the streets, we immediately noticed a very bright large stream of light ahead of us in the sky.  The stream of light was running horizontally illuminating the darkness east side of the sky.   We both looked trying to figure out what it was or where the light was coming from.  We realized that it was from a large object with dimmer light and haze floating in the sky.  The stream of light was like two huge lamps pointing east.   We can not precisely tell the form of the object producing the stream of light, but can definitely say it was moving and shortening the stream of light until both, object & light totally disappear instantly in front of our eyes like a flash!!!;27.5567179591844;-99.4987245408168
Light traveling West to East across the sky.;2012-01-17 18:57:00;30 seconds;Light traveling West to East across the sky. While star gazing during the evening, I saw an off-white dot, moving too fast to be a plane or jet, and too slow to be a meteorite.  It moved from West-SW to East-NE directly above us and its trajectory covered the whole sky dome.   I had my laser pointer and quickly pointed to it so my wife could verify with me what I was seeing. She confirmed the sighting.  A plane usually has accompanying intermittent lights and sound, which were not present.  A meteorite usually has a tail and fades as it enter the atmosphere these features were not present.  Our location is 27 36 6 N 99 28 58 W.;27.5567179591844;-99.4987245408168
