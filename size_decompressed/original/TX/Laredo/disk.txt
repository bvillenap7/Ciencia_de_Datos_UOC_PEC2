Laredo Texas sighting November 2006;2006-11-06 09:00:00;minutes;Laredo Texas sighting November 2006 A friend and I were driving around the city when her sister called her, she just looked out the window and was looking into the sky and said there's something in the sky. This is when she tells me that for a couple of day her family and herself had been seeing a lot of movement in the sky. She describes it as a star moving in different directions. This when I stop the car and look  out in the sky and that was what I saw, a star moving up and down. This when I suggest going to Kruger field, where we could probably have a clearer view. As we get there I do see it clear but still far a cicular object with purple,red,greenish lights turning. That was really strange, at this moment I am tring to make sense of what I was looking at, but I could not. my friend and I were in shock. I took pictures with my phone but the pictures were not clear. I did call several people and they were as surprised  to see what I saw. After that I tried to watch the news to see if anyone had seen anything, but nothing. A couple of months later as I was searching on the internet I found out that there was a UFO sighting on an airport in Chicago and Houston around the same time we saw this in Laredo. I have heard that several border patrol in Laredo have seen strange things in the sky. Its been 2 years since I saw this and I am very intrigued by the subject on UFO's.
