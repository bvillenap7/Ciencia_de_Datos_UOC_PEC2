Fiery object falling, breaks into 2 pieces, each dart toward opposite horizons;1996-12-28 20:00:00;10 seconds;Fiery object falling, breaks into 2 pieces, each dart toward opposite horizons. My dad and I were driving down Mines Rd toward the Columbia Bridge on our way to a hunting camp in Mexico.  While conversing, a bright fiery object appeared out of nowhere and seemed to be falling.  We asked one another, Are you seeing that?   After falling for about 7 seconds, it broke into two pieces, darting toward the horizon in opposite directions. To this day we still talk of this event and have no explanation for what was seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
