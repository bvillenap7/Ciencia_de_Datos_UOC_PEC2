Massive object passing over house;2002-05-05 01:00:00;20 seconds;Massive object passing over house A beautiful night, clear sky, went outside with my girlfriend so our dog could take care of business...I was watching the dog running around the yard… I noticed my girlfrient glancing up and she grabbed my arm and I looked at her expression and I looked up also...She tried to speak..i stopped her because i saw what she did and i wanted to hear if this object flying over the house was making a noise, such as a jet engine, prop, etc...if this website is for real...let me say that this was a real experience… I am an educated person of sound mind and i can say that i, and my friend, definitely observed a massive (a block long) boomranged shaped ufo silently glide over us going south no more that several hundred feet above us...No sound, just a massive object that blocked out our view of the stars as it passed overhead.   It passed over us very fast and and as we saw it go away from us a glow of greenish lights seemed to come from the back of this object...again...this massive object just seemed to be gliding over us...no noise...nothing that i have ever seen or am aware of...I do not think that mankind has this type of technology to explain what I and my girlfriend saw...   After the object was gone ((name deleted)) (my girlfriend)and I got the dog, went inside the house and sat down and I told her to gather her thoughts before we talked about what we had seen...I wanted to get her version of what she saw and I wanted to tell her what I saw...We saw the same thing...It definately was not from this planet...Later i called contacted a friend of mine who is a ufo nut and I made an official reporting with some type of agency...end of story...we are not alone here...and trust me...there is a much higher intellengence out there ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
