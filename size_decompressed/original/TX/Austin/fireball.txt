A bright gold glow during a silvery lightning storm;1992-06-01 21:00:00;5-10 minutes;A bright gold glow during a silvery lightning storm It was night, around 9 pm. There was a big dramatic storm, with thunder and lightning. The lightning gave a cold light. I lived on the top of the hill on 12th street east of Lamar. I was lying on my back on the floor with the lights out, with my feet facing the french doors, watching the display. All of a sudden there was a bright gold light that filled the windows. It wasn't a lightning bolt, and I waited for it to be over, but it stayed and stayed. I got up and got dressed, thinking something really big was happening (something I had never seen before, I wasn't sure what, but something big) and I might have to go outside. During all that time of deciding to get up, finding my clothes, and putting on shoes and socks the light just stayed, glowing warmly, filling the whole sky. Then it was gone.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Saw a glowing fireball plunge through the sky towards earth.;1998-11-16 06:40:00;5 seconds;Saw a glowing fireball plunge through the sky towards earth. I witnessed this on my way to work at approximately 6:40 Monday morning. In the sky to the north I saw a huge fireball flying through the sky headed downwards. I assumed at the time that it was only a meteor entering the atmosphere(what with leonid and all), but have seen footage of an object identical to mine, and anlysis of the footage of this other object said it could not have been a meteor.

objects over central texas so bright look like stars except its broad daylight;2000-04-20 17:00:00;0:02;objects over central texas so bright look like stars except its broad daylight there are many ufo stories but this one is mine. i was walking home one afternoon after work. now the sky was chrystal clear a beautiful blue texas sky. suddenly i saw a bright light in the sky it was so bright and intense it instantly reminded me of a star yeah thats right it was the size of a star that one can see at night, a clear black night only it was broad daylight. well my mind began running the scenariosmust be the sun reflecting off of a jet. im sure you have seen a reflection off of a jet before. have you noticed when the jet makes its turn that the suns reflection rolls off leaving a silouete of the plane against the sky. well not this one as i was expecting the reflection subsided yet there was no sillouete of any craft let alone a jet. the light i saw was so bright it looked like a star you would see at night it must of been the suns reflection right? well 2 weeks later i was traveling from austin to san antonio with a buddy in his truck we were headed south i i35 when it happened again i am now witnessing the same effect as 2 weeks ago only now i have a witness to confirm me. i said hey do you see that light in the sky and he said yeah its a plain right? i said maybe but if im right this light in the sky will dissappear and no plane will be seen. well it happened just as i said it would and he was stumped ive had 2 more sightings of these strange blazingly bright objects since then. the sightings only last a few seconds so if you are not looking up you probably have no chance to ever see them but folks i tell you we are not alone and thats all there is to it!!!

HUGE blazing falling object (NOT the Mir).;2001-03-19 18:50:00;?20 minutes?;HUGE blazing falling object (NOT the Mir). OK, this was not so much a craft, per se, as something enormous burning and fallng very slowly to Earth. NOTE: This was NOT the MIR, as this event was the Monday before. At sunset this past Monday, several people including myself, all abslutely stone-cold-sober, were at a Texaco gas station located on a high hill, at the intersection of Exposition and Westover in West Austin. We consists of myself, a 50-year-old semi-disabled retiree and college student my son, ((deleted))l, 28, who works for a prestegious ((deleted)) company, doing precision ((deleted)) work ((deleted)) friend and co-worker, ((deleted)) two adult male Service Station mechanics. They were fixing a truck my sonhad just bought the day before at an auction, and we all met there to check out the progress. My brother, ((deleted)), a photographer, who didn't have his camera and I could just kick him, had just been there to check out Joel's truck and had just driven away. A few minutes after ((deleted)) left, around 6:30pm or so, he called on this cell phone very excitedly and told us to immediately go out and look to the West in the sky. He said there was this amazing streak of fire falling really slowly toward the horizon. By the time we got outside, whatever it was had just broken up into three distinct pieces, all of which continued to fall incredibly slowly to the horizon. I guess they wer e at about 40 degrees or so up from the horizon when we first saw them. ((deleted)) rported it was higher when he saw it, and it was falling very rapidly. apparently when it broke apart, it started falling more slowly? Anyway, we first assumed it was the Mir falling (we obviously weren't real up on the details about when that was supposed to happen last Monday, although we know all about it now), but then we were reminded that Mir wasn't going to fall for a few more days. I was immeditaely concerned that it could be our space shuttle, which was also up there somewhere. But whatever it was really seemed like it must have been bigger thaftn that. We were amazed at how high and HUGE this object must have been, since it was probably 15-20 minutes at least before it finally disappeared into the horizon. We rushed home and swiched on the news, but, amazingly again, ther was NOTHING!! We've watched all week, but NOTHING (but the Mir, big deal. This object looked to be WAY West of Austin, Texas, as we were looking pretty much due West, I think. It wasn't dark yet, and we could all clearly see that this was in no way anything but something ON FIRE, not contrails or anything routine. We've ALL been walking around in question marks all week! Help! Has anyone else reported anything? For the sake of our fragile sanity, we'd sure appreciate a quick response of some kind, if only to tell us you're checking on it.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Bright lights in the sky;2011-02-17 18:30:00;10 minutes or so;Bright lights in the sky Driving home from work, I noticed people standing in their yards looking at the sky. As I made a turn, there was a car stopped in the middle of the street and the woman in the car had her head hanging out the window talking on her phone also looking up. I then looked up and there were two lights in the sky, they reminded me of what a flare would look like in clouds but they were moving slowly and moving together at a fairly close proximity. They were a flickering yellow orange color with an orb-like appearance but maybe that had something to do with the clouds. I drove on home and lost sight of the lights but when I went in our backyard, there was another light in the sky. My husband also saw this one. It was not in the clouds like the first two. There were plenty of people here trying to figure out what they were looking at. It was close to dusk so possibly a reflection from the sun. Could not tell the altitude but we also saw a plane that appeared to be higher and it was clearly a plane.  These objects were in the clouds that seemed to be lower but like I said, it’s hard to tell when you don’t know what you’re looking at. I work at a high school and my husband is an engineer. The only reason I am reporting it is that it’s not on the news and I know at least 20 people were watching the sky tonight. We have never seen anything like this before…;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Bright green fireball with long bright green tail streaks across the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a meteor.  PD));2012-02-01 20:00:00;10 seconds;Bright green fireball with long bright green tail streaks across the sky. Between 7:50 pm and 8:10 pm on the night of Feb 1st 2012, I witnessed UFO in Austin, TX. Physical appearance:  A bright green fireball with a long bright green tail.    The fireball was much bigger than any star but smaller than the moon.  The tail was almost as bright – and just as green – as the fireball.  There was no trail. Length of time:  I witnessed it for five or ten seconds.  Long enough to realize it wasn’t a flare or fireworks because it never dissipated.  Eventually, it went beyond the horizon (tall trees about a block away).  I did not see it decrease in brightness. Trajectory:  I was facing north.  The fireball was heading northeast.  It seemed to be moving downward at a small angle, from my perspective about 25 degrees.  It appeared to be moving away from me, so it’s hard to tell if it was actually falling towards the earth.  Basically, I saw it move across the northern sky until it disappeared beyond the treetops. Location:  I was at an outdoor seating area of a food trailer park on the 2200 block of East Cesar Chavez Street in Austin, TX.  About a mile and a half east of downtown and about four miles northwest of the airport. About a minute after I witnessed this, a low-flying helicopter zoomed overhead, from the direction of the airport, going in the exact direction I witnessed the fireball.  This might be a coincidence because I was relatively close to the airport.  I’m confident of the time because I was on the phone when I saw it, and the time given above is from the call history.  There were about eight other people eating in this area, (along with some kitchen workers in the various food trailers) and two performing musicians.  Nobody else saw the fireball as they were all watching the musicians or working. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable meteor, we suspect.  Video suggests a meteor to us.  PD));30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Orb or Fireball seen in Austin Tuesday;2012-03-20 01:00:00;a few minutes;Orb or Fireball seen in Austin Tuesday We had some huge thunderstorms roll in to Austin at 1 am early Tuesday morning 3/20.

He said he looked down and saw a red light that he thought could be a golf cart.  This is a heavily wooded area that is hard to walk in.  You couldn’t take a golf cart through there, let alone do it during a rain storm.  I, who have never actually seen a UFO, congratulated him on his first UFO sighting.  I was just joking but then I said sounds like you saw an orb.  He paused for about a minute and said, Now that you mention it, that’s exactly what it looked like.   I just played Peter Davenport from C2C just today at work (Th 3/22) so it may have been the red fireball he was talking about.   I am really into UFOs and have never seen one myself, and he had no idea of my interest in them before Tuesday.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

No sound though highway noise was present.  It appeared to be sort of floating but still moving away. Just didn't move right.  Slowly faded above and behind treeline.  As first one faded a second appeared from due south above treeline moved north and arced east on exact same path as previous.  Identical flight pattern and characteristics and craft appearance.   As it faded to the exact same location as the previoius another appeared from exact same location on same path.  This repeated for a total of 4 craft after the first.  Very strange shaped lights, flight behavior, path and movement. No noise. First thought:  Airplane/Jetliner Second thought: Helicopter Third thought: Absolutely no idea. If it's a helicopter or jet, its not like any I've ever seen. My 11 year old son grabbed my phone and we videoed the last one.  Video sucks but I \ve got it.Its from my phone.

Dark object flames-out over sw skies of Austin, TX.;2015-06-11 21:05:00;15 seconds;Dark object flames-out over sw skies of Austin, TX. Austin, Texas.  Approximately 21:05, June 11, 2015.  In the southwestern skies, toward Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, below the level that an airplane would pass, I witnessed a 5 to 15 second flaming object descending in the sky.  The sky was twilight but not yet totally night.   The object had a long glowing white tail like a falling star, but it had an red/orange (like it was flaming) area just before the tail in what I'll call the mid-section of the object.  Just in front of the red/orange are was a black portion which was the front of the object.  It looked rounded at the front.  It definitely looked like it was flaming-out (burning up as it descended) but it was not descending quickly but rather was moving in a leveled elevation.  I saw the white tail first, then the red/orange area appeared, grew more prominent then the entire object seemed to flame-out while moving very quickly in a rather straight line only descending slightly (not like a falling star but traveling leveled).  The object then disappeared.  I did not see it descend any farther, it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Sparks were emanating from it similar to those a large Tesla coil produces.  The light then disappeared and a smaller metallic object appeared where the light was.  The object was a lustrous disc or saucer-shaped object and appeared to land west of I-35.  Hundreds of people saw this. There were massive and alternating blackouts in Austin 12-24 hours before this took place.
