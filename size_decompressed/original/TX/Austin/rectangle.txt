Large rectangular, metallic, no sound, no lights, just above trees, not moving trees, Austin, TX end of 1996 thru 1997;1997-06-01 00:00:00;few seconds;Large rectangular, metallic, no sound, no lights, just above trees, not moving trees, Austin, TX end of 1996 thru 1997 From Oct of 1996 thru 1997 I lived in an apartment on Fathom Circle in Austin, Texas.  It was late at night.  I went outside to walk my boyfriend to his car.  He was much taller than I so when I hugged him goodnight I looked up towards the sky. There were a few deem lights on the property where we were standing.  As I looked up there was just enough light to show a very large rectangular metallic looking flying craft just above the trees.  There was just enough light to show the outline.  There was no sound and no movement of the trees despite how close it was to the trees.  The craft was very large and I saw no lights.  It did however block out the stars.  I never told anyone because I didn’t think anyone would believe me.  I was so shocked I didn’t even say anything to my boyfriend.  It was moving slowly, but would have passed behind the trees before he would have seen it.  I just said goodnight and went to bed.  I have tried to forget about it all of thes! e years, but after seeing all of the reports of sightings lately on T.V. and the history of UFOs, I felt I should at least let someone know. Maybe someone else saw what I did.  I never made note of the month or time, I just know I was living there from Oct 1996 thru 1997.  I actually felt privileged to see such a sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in 1997 is approximate.  PD));30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
The object almost impacted our windshield;2013-04-26 23:00:00;20 seconds;The object almost impacted our windshield We were driving to my daughters house around 11:00 PM last night.  An object flew directly at our windshield, the middle section was squared with 2 round lights they were the brightness of a traffic light and both steady, one red light and one green, each was around 5 in diameter, the surrounding squared shape was maybe 2 feet in length and 2 feet in width.  From both sides of the squared shape there appeared to be a thin obscured silver or white curved, almost rope like in appearance, spanning at least 15 feet on both sides, it is very hard to describe.  The object shocked us as I mentioned it came directly at our windshield and just before an impact would occur  the object when directly up into the sky and disappeared.  This all happened very fast.  We did go back to the location a few moments later and could not find anything out of the ordinary or that would have caused what we just seen.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Craft videoed near daybreak near Austin.;2013-08-18 05:30:00;75 minutes;Craft videoed near daybreak near Austin I was using binoculars to search for the ISON comet in the northeastern sky.  The sky was evenly overcast with haze and reflected the city lights, and buildings blocked the lower northeast sky.  I gave up on the comet, and  noticed I could spot only four or five stars even with my sports binoculars.  I turned them toward the flight path  to our airport.  I saw a jetliners following the usual pattern, above the trees and apartment complexes east of my second floor balcony.     Maybe five minutes later I focused on another set of similar lights in the same direction and elevation, and because a white light was blinking and there seemed to be an orange light at the back and a bluish white light on the front, I assumed it was another plane.  I have a table and a chair on he balcony, and tipped the table  up on end and sat in my chair steadying my binoculars.  I realized that the object did not move relative to the roofs of neighboring  complexes.   That would mean! the plane was far, far away, and enormous, but repeated observation over about seven minutes convinced me that the object in the sky was not a jetliner and was not moving toward the airport at all. Daylight was coming soon, and I doubted that I could locate my digital camera and get it set up in time to photograph the unrecognized object, but I hoped that it could be done, and by steadying the camera and going to full 15x optical zoom.  I could get some 10 megapixel color videos to study at my leisure.  The binoculars are about 10x, but the images were fleeting and begged to be studied carefully. I took the camera off its tripod and rushed to the balcony. I hoped the batteries would last.  The warning screen on the back of the camera showed some red lines across the battery icon, and I know my time was short. I sat on my sturdy chair,  leaned the lightweight folding table against my knees, and did my best to locate the strange object using the view screen on the back of the camera.  It was a challenge, and the camera was unsteady.  The image on the screen was basically a black grey haze, and the craft was invisible.  With the naked eye I could see the craft and using a left of the table and a tree branch visible on the view screen, I aimed and shot several videos.  I finally stopped and rushed to get fresh batteries.  I changed from the view screen to the “through the lens” viewfiner.  At last I could see the UFO, and hoped that despite the shaking of the camera, I might capture at least a few images of the elusive UFO. Soon the sky was too bright for viewing the UFO, and I left the balcony.  It was about 6:30 AM and I had a lot of chores to do to prepare for a visit from a relative.  I finally got enough work done to allow me to slip the SD card into my desktop computer and chec! k my videos.  I was delighted to see that in the several videos I shot, a few second of “UFO” images appeared.  The shaky camera made it look like the UFO was zooming all over, but it was not.  With the naked eye, it appeared to be motionless in the sky.  I don’t know if my UFO was actually a set of lights on a tall tower atop a distant hill, or an actual craft in the sky.  Because I have never noticed anything like this UFO in the 29 months I’ve been in this city, even though I have been an avid airplane watcher for seventy years.  I was a Civil Air Patrol Cadet, studying at Randolph, Lackland and Barksdale AFBs in the 1950s and an aviation enthusiast the rest of my life. Upon examining the videos, it seems that the UFO was actually three or four lights, perhaps all attached to one hovering object.  On the right was a round, seemingly “shattered” white or light-greenish orb.  If the craft had been headed for a landing at the airport, the light on the right would be at the  “front.” Additionally there was a red dot of fairly bright light below and on the middle of the bottom, and a dimly lit thin horizontal line of yellowish white light at the “rear” where the vertical stabilizer would be on a jetliner.  When I first spotted the craft, there was a blinking white light where the red light appears in the videos, and I thought it was a regular aircraft strobe light.  Upon examination, I have not seen it. When I say “front” or “rear,” I am assuming the craft was aligned with the landing approach jetliners follow from north of the city to the airport on the south east. I’m sorry that the videos are tedious to look at, but I don’t know a thing about editing them to eliminate all the “dead” time. August 18, 2013;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Out of nowhere, the brightest white lights came zooming across the sky and stopped in front of us, hovered and turned then zoomed off again through a building.  There was no sound or air movement.  The shape was rectangular that was 3-D.  The lights were brighter than any lights we had ever seen in the sky.  It was peaceful. The 4 our us looked at each other and simultaneously said, “did you see that?”  “What was that?”  One of the individuals is an executive in the international aviation business so knowledgeable that it was not an airplane, helicopter or drone for multiple reasons as it was silent and the speed was faster than any of them as we watch them from the balcony. Two of the individuals are engineers and PhD’s at a Fortune 500 company and began a process of elimination of what it could be. The four of us all agree it was not anything we had ever seen before.  It was peaceful, amazing and a one-time experience. It happened too fast to take a photo unfortunately.  :(;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
