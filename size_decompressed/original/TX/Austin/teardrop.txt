Teardrop/triangle silver and shiny object moving at slow steady speed in perfect weather during broad daylight in Austin, TX.;2003-10-20 13:00:00;3 to 5 minutes;Teardrop/triangle silver and shiny object moving at slow steady speed in perfect weather during broad daylight in Austin, TX. A friend and myself were driving to lunch around 1:00 pm in northwest Austin, TX.  As soon as we made a righthand turn onto the frontage road along 183 N., I noticed what appeared to be a teardrop or possibly a triangular silver object that was reflecting sunlight approximately 3000 to 5000 feet (it could have been as low as 1000 feet) above the surface looking to the south/southwest.  My buddy noticed it as well to confirm that I was not seeing a reflection in his side door window.  The sky was perfectly clear, so we were not mistaking a cloud formation, nor were we mistaking this for man made utility infrastruture because it was well above these in the sky.  We were about 1000 yards from the intersection and my buddy decided to make a u-turn to get on the other side of the expressway to get a better look.  As we were heading towards the u-turn, the object appeared to be heading at a slower speed than usual for any type of aircraft that I know is possible barring a  helicopter.  It was moving steady from south/southeast to north/northwest.  At times, it appeared to be actually hovering.  It also appeared to be vectoring in about a 30 degree slow and steady ascent.  There appeared to be no wing or tail structure of any kind that I could detect.  The skin was smooth with no identifying features (windows, ports, markings, etc).  No propulsion of either propeller or jet type was visible.  There was no sign of a contrail or any kind of exhaust or distortion in the sky from the leading or trailing edges of the object.  Since we were in the car at the time of indentification, we could not determine if any sound was coming from the craft.  I am former military in communications/intelligence with top secret, so I DO know my aircraft recognition.  By the time my buddy made his u-turn and we got to the other side of the expressway on the opposite frontage road, the object was nowhere to be seen in either direction of it's vector for next 3 to 5 minutes after making the u-turn.  It appeared to had just vanished without a trace.  There were other aircraft (commercial and private) in the nearby vicinity, but these were clearly recognizable as man made aircraft and did not appear to be evading the object.  This is very interesting, because this sighting is very similar to the sighting in Houston on 10/07/2003.  If I had to guess if this craft was noiseless, then I would say that it was.  A very interesting day for us indeed.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Durning a lightning storm a grey jellyfish looking craft that emitts no light changes in to a 3-D rectangle with lights.;2008-04-25 11:14:00;33 minutes;Durning a lightning storm a grey jellyfish looking craft that emitts no light changes in to a 3-D rectangle with lights. A severe thunderstorm came through and about 30 minutes after the thunder and lightning had begun, my husband and I were watching the lightning storm.  The lightning was striking fast and the entire sky was lighting up.  My husband then asks me what is floating in the sky.  I look up to where was pointing and I see it.  It was a grey craft that looked somewhat like a jellyfish with no lights emitting from it. It moved in what I can only describe as an organic manner.  We watched for a few minutes as it moved from one place to another.  Some times we lost track of where it was but would see it again only a moment later, as it stayed in the same general area.  Then it ended up flying closer to us and when the sky lit up again the grey craft tuned in to what looked like a geometric 3-d rectangle.  The outer edges of the “rectangle” were lit up with all different colors.  After the lightning strike and the sky went dark the craft again looked like the grey jellyfish with no emitting light.  It then moved back to its previous general location but looked a little paler than it had at first.  Maybe it was further away and we could not see it as well.  After about 30 minutes we were no longer able to see it.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Ceramic-surface, teardrop-shaped craft with horizontal drooping winglets floating southbound over Burnet Rd.;2016-11-01 05:30:00;5 seconds;Ceramic-surface, teardrop-shaped craft with horizontal drooping winglets floating southbound over Burnet Rd. I was on a daily morning walk before work and walking eastbound on Ashdale Drive, heading to Burnet Road.  I happened to see a light brown, ceramic-looking craft floating above tree tops, heading slowly southbound over Burnet Road.  Craft was completely silent, with no lights.  It was visible in the dark morning only due to abundant street lighting along Burnet Road.  Shape appeared to be elongated teardrop-shaped with very thin drooping winglets on sides.  No vertical features visible on craft.  No windows apparent. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
