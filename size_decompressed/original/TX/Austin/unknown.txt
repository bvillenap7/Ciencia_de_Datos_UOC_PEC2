Was not plane/helicopter, nor planet/star. Approx 11pm, looking s/se from SW Austin, sky was very clear, no moon, I noticed one of planet was very bright and twinkling oddly.  Upon reporting to my roommate we became suspicious of object.  For one hr. it didn't move, flashing red, yellow, white. Appeared to be 1-2 miles above far south/se Austin or just north of San Marcos.  We ruled out aircraft and planets/stars.  With binoculars I had to rack focus from stars to object.  There was obvious depth/definition/form to object. It wasn't aircraft.  It was apparently 1 mile from ground, approx. 20 miles S. of downtown Austin.  Possibly satellite? Only possibility in our opinion.  One wk later a friend in San Antonio told me he saw UFO on same night to north/northeast of SA @ same approx time.  Similar description in height/location.  This was the night b4 meteor shower.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
From SW Austin btween Austin / San Marcos stationary object in sky 1 mile up w/ lights.;1999-02-15 23:00:00;unknown;From SW Austin btween Austin/San Marcos stationary object in sky 1 mile up w/ lights. Looking southeast from the Oakhill area of SW Austin, while closing blinds, I noticed a strange light in the sky appearing betwen Austin & San Marcos, approx 1 mile above ground.  Object hovered & was quite bright, had other colored, lights but was too far away to see exactly how many, what color,  etc.  Did not look like any man-made aircraft or satellite.  I notified my roommate who was alarmed as well.  We watched for nearly an hour as it hovered.  We went outside for better view, eventually going to bed after 2 hrs. of object hovering, approx. 4 am, awoke & object was gone.  This was not a star or aircraft, this was a bright object w/ many lights hovering.  through binoculars object appeared to have multiple surfaces.  Additionally, roommate & I saw black helicopter a few weeks later.  Helicopter was silent & flying over sw Austin & struck us as odd for we had never seen a quiet helicopter.  Roommate has also seen a similar copter over his land in rural central TX near La Grange. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Two objects that would normally be assumed to be stars except too low in the sky, changing colors - blue/green to white, to red. appear;1999-09-07 23:00:00;30 min. +;Two objects that would normally be assumed to be stars except too low in the sky, changing colors - blue/green to white, to red. appeared to be hovering, only slightly changing postion, moving lower on the horizon. One larger and more visible than smaller object to the northeast of it, otherwise identical. the previous evening my roommate and i had witnessed the same strange lights in the sky, we had called the police to report it (1:30 am) and two officers came out.  they thought they were following up on a hoax until they followed us into our backyard and witnessed the objects for themselves.  the officers called around to local airports and airforce base and could not find an explanation.  We ruled out helicopters, these objects (then one large and 4 smaller) hovered in one place for over and hour - definitlely not a plane, and too low and stationary for a satellite ( we assumed) -- so, on 9/7/99 (tonight) i went outside on the off chance there might be another sighting and i found one of the objects low in the sky to the west of my house ( the previous evening they had been to the northeast).  i called a friend who owns a telescope and he went outside to see, he called me and reported another smaller one above the one i spotted.  He could not explain the flashing objects either.  These were lowering on the horizon quickly, so soon they were behind the trees and i could no longer see them (approx. 30 min.) I am a college gradute with a degree in English - i have an open mind, but tried to explain this sighting logically (plane, satellite, etc...) none of these explanations seemed satisfactory.  I am very interested to know if anyone else reported a similar event either night.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
I witnessed an extremely bright, pulsing object at approx. 3000 ft, slowly descending and then accelerating - this object was completel;1999-11-08 20:45:00;20 minutes;I witnessed an extremely bright, pulsing object at approx. 3000 ft, slowly descending and then accelerating - this object was completely silent. I am a 27 year old Austin, Tx resident.  I was travelling on northbound Interstate 35, joining 35 from 183.  I was heading north towards the Braker Lane exit.  The time was approximately 8:45 p.m. on Monday, November 8th,  and I had just left my office to join some friends watching the Dallas game that had just started at 8:00.    As I was travelling north on I35,  I became aware of an extremely bright, pulsating object in the sky.   The object appeared to be descending rather slowly,  and was extremely bright - several times brighter than any visible stars in the sky.  As I exited on Braker Lane,  heading along the frontage road,  I still managed to track the object.  The object descended appromately 1000,  then changed direction,  heading almost due south.  By that time,  I was travelling east on Braker lane,  and became aware of more details about this peculiar object.  The object appeared to be accelerating - my estimate would be approx. 400-450 miles an hour at this point.  Something else caught my eye - 2 tiny lights that were trailing this object.  By this time,  Both objects had passed me,  and I was looking behind them as they continued south.  The original bright object that I first sighted now appeared to sport several red blinking lights on the anterior of the object - these lights blinked in sequence, similar to standard navigational lights (however,  there were at least 5-6 of these lights on the anterior of the craft).  In addition,  there appeared to be some kind of strobe or circular light on the belly of the craft - this appears to be what accounted for the extremely bright, pulsating light that I had witnessed earlier.  However,  as the object was starting to become perpindicular/head away from me at this point,  this characteristic had become less apparent.  The two white lights that were trailing the craft (from about a mile) appeared to be the exhaust of a seperate,  conventional jet aircraft.  As I arrived at my friends house I immediately stopped my engine and climbed out,  stil! l tracki ng the two objects.  The first thing I noticed was that the first craft was extremely silent - no audible propulsion sounds were discernable.  In addition,  dogs in yards directly under the craft's path were barking loudly,  and this could be heard distinctly as the craft passed over the subdivision.  What appeared to be a jet aircraft followed this path shortly after the unidentified craft,  and this audible noise did not disturb the animals.  I lost sight of both objects as they passed over the horizon,  but that is not the end of my sighting. At approximately 9:10 pm the same night,  I had stepped outside into the backyard of my friend's duplex to smoke a cigarette.  I must make the disclaimer at this point that I was in no way under the influence of any psychoactive/hallucinogenic substances,  or even alcohol. Stunned by the earlier sighting,  I watched the skies as I smoked the cigarette.  To my suprise,  looking east over the roof of the duplex,  I spotted a bright light of similar intensity slowly arcing up in a straight path.  Iridium satellite, or some other orbiting satellite,  is what I first thought.  The altitude/speed seemed consistent with an orbital satellite - however, as this object passed right over my head,  I was again able to glimpse the flashing red lights on the anterior,  and then knew it was the same object as I had seed earlier.  However,  this time the object's altitude was (estimated)  at least 50-60000 feet,  and it's speed had to be several times supersonic,  at least mach 8-9,  to account for the terrific speed in which it traversed the sky from horizon to horizon.  It's long,  arcing flight from horizon to horizon occured within about 4-5 seconds,  and that was a good indication of it's altitude and speed,  as I watched it ascend from the east, pass straight over me,  and continue to the west,  until it passed from my view.   I did not see any conventional aircraft in pursuit this time (no conventional aircraft to my knowledge could demonstrate  this type of acceleration/speed). My final thoughts:  The red blinking lights indicate possible navigation lights,  lending an earthly explanation to this - could this be an Aurora sighting?  One thing's for certain, though,  this is new and completely unconventional propulsion system.  I believe that the bright, pulsating glow of the circle? underneath the craft has something to do with the propulsion - just by shear virtue of its intense luminosity.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Gliding silver object there one second, gone the next;2003-12-19 11:00:00;seconds;Gliding silver object there one second, gone the next On 12/19/03, at 11:00 a.m. in Austin, Tx. I was taking my daily walk.  It was a clear, beautiful, sunny day.  I felt compelled to look behind me there was no one on the trail, but I looked up because my eye was caught by what I thought was a plane, but it didn't have the body of a plane.   It was at about 20 to 25,000 ft altitude.   The sun shone on it and there was a silver, metallic flash on the body.  I watched it gliding and in seconds it vanished into thin air, completely evaporated.  The sighting was of too short duration to determine the shape of the object.  I knew I had seen an unidentified object.  I continued walking.  I subsequently counted 20 airplanes at approximately 30 to 35,000 ft altitude going towards or leaving Austin Airport.  Each one of them left contrails.   The object I saw had no contrails.    After counting the 10th plane, I saw, going in the opposite direction in a haphazard way, a tiny ball.   It was illuminated by the sun and completely disappeared.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Very still evening.  Could not see much detail, but the shape appeared flat on one side with a subtle dome on the other..  Shade was lighter on one side, but predominantly black. There were no lights on this object and no sound.  It doesn't seem possible that anyone could travel inside of it, so we are thinking it could be some sort of surveillance craft.

Spacing between lights did not change Although it was in our sight only a few seconds due to passing over the big tree in the back yard, we both agree on what we saw even though we have no idea what it was. What we saw was four white lights arranged in a rectangular pattern: two in front and two bringing up the rear. It was going pretty fast, although a low flying airliner could have been going that fast.    The length could have been consistent with an airliner. However, there were no flashing lights. No red, no green, no flashing white. There also was no sound that we could hear above normal traffic noise from I-35 a mile away. Had I more presence of mind, perhaps I would have jumped up and ran further toward the back of the yard to keep it in sight a little longer. Not hearing it, I sort of expected the sound to catch up, but it didn't.???;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

White spinning object passed overhead in daylight.;2008-08-14 14:30:00;just a couple of minutes;White spinning object passed overhead in daylight. While taking a smoke break at work, I noticed an object moving across the sky from east to west.  At first the object looked like a white bird very high in the sky.  As I watched it move at a steady pace in a straight line from east to west, I could clearly see that the object was rotating in a counter-clockwise direction.  It appeared to be spinning across the sky.  The rate of rotation and movement remained constant. There were a few clounds in the sky and the object was below the cloud level.  I watched it pass under a cloud that was close to directly overhead.  I observed the object for a few minutes, until it was too far away to see. The object made no detectable sound.  I don't know what this was, but it was clearly not a bird or a plane.  For a moment I thought it was a plastic grocery bag being blown very high, but when it got closer I could clearly see that it was rotating at a steady pace.  It looked like it was rectangular shaped, spinning about its center at about one revolution per second. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Object with unusually large and luminous lights seen hovering completely still 100 yards off the highway.;2010-03-02 05:00:00;30 seconds;Object with unusually large and luminous lights seen hovering completely still 100 yards off the highway. Driving at 5:00 AM on I-35 in S. Austin, a object with unusual lights was seen about 100 yards off of the interstate, hovering completely still about 300-400 feet in the air. The object had larger and more luminous lights than normal, with one steady blue light and one slowly blinking red light. The driver approached the object and it was completely stationary. First impression was that the object was some sort of tethered balloon with lights, but subsequent events ruled out this possibility. Upon passing underneath the object, driver noted that the body of the craft appeared to have a very unusual shape, possibly triangular, though it was difficult to see under the conditions. The object remained stationary for the duration that the driver could view it in the rear-view mirror.  Driver then made a u-turn on the interstate as soon as possible to return to the sight of the spotting. Upon returning approximately 2 minutes later, the craft was nowhere to be see! n, which was thought to be unusual since if it had been a hovering helicopter he would have expected to see it moving off into the distance. Driver wished he could have seen the object move to obtain more information, but it seems likely that the object was an unusual craft of some sort.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Gold hazy being hovering (like standing on edge of craft) while over apt building in NW Austin - amber lights on edges.;2013-10-12 03:08:00;Recorded 17 seconds;Gold hazy &quotbeing&quot hovering (like standing on edge of craft) while over apt building in NW Austin - amber lights on edges. Austin, TX Oct. 12, 2013 3:08:40 A.M. My window faces to the South.  There are no lights out that way, so it is very dark since we are tucked into a dense ranch.  Being that my window is on the top floor of a 3rd story apartment, I can see above the tree lines. In the wee hours the morning of the 12th, I peeked out the window to check my van and weather before I went to sleep.  I was startled by a bright amber light about 1/2 a block away - maybe closer.  I opened the window to get a better view. The light was still and silent.  I even waved at it, and then I went to get my cell phone to video it.  When I returned, it was still there, and that shocked me.  I had half expected it to have left. I fumbled to see how to operate my new device, and eventually took a short video, but I was not sure if it was working.  I forgot about the light and the video till today. Had I seen what the video showed, I would have camped out to see them leave!  In the video, it shows several amber lights with white tinier ones behind the main one.  Off to the left - there were more, and I cannot help but think I was so concerned as to whether the cell was taking video, I did not see the entire picture of the outside sky.  I recall turning the camera right to left to pan, as my window is rather narrow, but it lasted only 17 seconds.  Now that I can see it, it appeared to be above and beyond my building hovering!  It sure looks like there is a hazy bright gold figure (full of light) just left of center of the main amber light in gold. (I would like to upload it if I can figure how to do that too.

Small silver circle object seen high in the sky not moving during daytime also seen a strange transparent plane flying around it;2019-08-30 12:00:00;15 minutes;Small silver circle object seen high in the sky not moving during daytime also seen a strange transparent plane flying around it Small silver ball object in the sky during the day.  It clearly looked like a small white dot in the sky but this was at 10am in the morning.  It was just very high in the sky not moving. It was a clear day so it stood out.  But it was hard to see it because it was small exactly like a star.  Also seen a transparent plane flying high in the sky.  It was going at a fast speed and I never seen a plane like that.  Only seen the plane for about 5 seconds than I couldn’t find it in the sky after that.  It looked like maybe it was flying around or near the object in the sky!     At first I didn’t pay no attention because I didn’t want to think it was a ufo at first.  I was assuming it was a plane or balloons.  10 minutes later were still talking and I’m still looking at this object above in the sky not moving.  I get my cousin to look in the sky and see if he sees it too and we’re looking into the sky as I can see it clearly but I’m trying to get him to see it too because he couldn’t see it with his vision.   While I’m trying to get him to spot out the object, I also spot what looked like to me a transparent plane flying high in the sky too, this plane looked strange like I never seen before because of its speed and how high it was in the sky.   I got my phone and recorded the other object and zoomed in on the object but it’s hard to identify what it is.  It just looks like a white dot in the sky.  Obviously not a plane or drone because it was too high in the sky and not moving.  We recorded the dot for about 5 minutes as it just stayed in the sky not moving.  We lost sight of it and couldn’t find it in the sky.  This was a really trippy morning because we couldn’t really identify what it was.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

WATCHED IT FADE OUT completely but it didn't move. thought was just a star.  it was near another smaller white star. though it was i guess more yellowish or orangish. just looked across sky as i smoked cig didn't notice it. as i happened to look back at the two stars the orangish yellowish one just FADED out. I mean it. It just faded out, I watched it disappear. And not 5 seconds later way further right in the sky i saw a shooting star come down, but it was an awesome shooting star it like split apart at end and went different directions... but seconds before the shooting star, the orangish star just FADED OUT.  what the hell was that.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

I was awakened by the sound of water rushing into my toilet (a sound I remember being confused about many times before happening only in the middle of the night). I saw a very very tiny completely silent drone? with blinking green light in my bathroom which shot a laser that hit me in the side. I could barely feel the laser. When the drone noticed that I was awake looking at it, it moved out of the bathroom and moved behind the cracks behind my open doors into my living room where I lost it. The thing is I have seen it before, but I was never sure that I was really awake until this time. I am sure I was awake.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
