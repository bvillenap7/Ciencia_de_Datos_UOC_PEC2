Chevron flew 5 mph, 150 yards from me, 200 feet off the ground.;1985-09-26 21:25:00;20 min.;Chevron flew 5 mph, 150 yards from me, 200 feet off the ground. I was inspired to finally report about what I saw 23 years ago by the recent interest spurred by the Stevenville, Texas sighting.  I have probably told this to approximately 10 to 15 people in all these years because as any other person that has seen a UFO can tell you “people think you are crazy”. This sighting happened in September or October of 1985. I was a teacher for a trade school for Austin Community Collage and a local union in Austin Texas.  I let out class around 9:00 PM on a Thursday night.  My route home took me down South Lamar to Brodie Lane.  This area of Austin was mostly farm land back then.  As I turned left onto Brodie, I saw an object in the sky moving over the farm house on my right.  I stopped and got out of my truck to get a better look.  There were a few other cars going by and I tried to get them to stop and see but they just kept going by.  It was approximately 150 yards from me and 200 feet off the ground.  It looked like both wings of a jet connected in the middle, boomerang or V shaped,  but there was no fuselage.  I later learned it was called chevron. On the front there were 6 extremely bright white lights, two close together on each side of the center and  single lights towards the tips.  Behind it where fuselage should be, was a hazy, foggy, reddish-pink glow.  It was moving steadily only about 5 miles per hour, silently except for a 3 or 4 second blast of what sounded like high pressure air release every 30 seconds.  I watched it for around 20 minutes  as it flew north-northwest directly over Barton Creek Mall. I called Bergstram, the closest Air Force base at that time, to report the sighting.  For the next few days I went back and forth with phone calls with different people and then they gave me the brush off.  They did, however, tell me they had no aircraft flying that night.  It feels good to report this after all these years.  This is the first time I have written down this experience.  I hope it will jog someone else’s memory that was in the area and serious investigation continues. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Rectangular glowing objects flying over Austin, TX;2007-04-11 22:00:00;7 seconds;Rectangular glowing objects flying over Austin, TX It was a clear night, there were no clouds in the sky at all. My friend and I were standing outside our apartment when I looked up and saw 2 glowing rectangular objects spaced evenly apart cruising smoothly across the sky towards the north. I told my friend to look and she also did not know what we were looking at. It was not birds, bats, or planes as there was no sound and they emitted a eerie yellowish glow. They were flying quite low, lower than all of the usual airplanes that fly over our area, and they were moving smoothly at a very high speed, we only watched them for about five or six seconds before they were out of sight. It's possible that they were military as they were flying in the direction of Ft. Hood, but I don't know of any unclassified silent glowing military aircraft that could travel at those speeds.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
UFO over Austin;2008-02-27 22:25:00;15 seconds;UFO over Austin Went outside while letting the dog out.  I looked up and saw a big craft flying low.  It wasn't running with any lights and made no noise whatsoever.   The night was clear and in the moonlight I could see pretty well.   The flight direction was from the south heading north and it was shaped similar to a stealth bomber type plane but was much larger.   It seemed to be just gliding but it was huge for a glider and much faster. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Low flying, gray object flew overhead at night, made absolutely no sound at all;2012-04-19 22:40:00;15 seconds;low flying, gray object flew overhead at night, made absolutely no sound at all I went out in my backyard to view the meteor shower. I was looking up when I noticed a white/gray object, either crescent or chevron shaped, directly over my head.  At first it seemed like someone was flying a kite or something but then I realized that was definitely not the case.  It was coming from the south headed about 30 degrees north east.  This is in the south austin area, it was sort of making its way north up w gate blvd.  It made no sound whatsoever and was moving about the speed of a single prop plane or glider slow enough for observation.  I can't tell how high up it was but it was much, much lower than any commercial airplane about the same altitude that a police helicopter would fly if they were trying to spotlight a subject. I am in my late 20's, and work in IT. I have always been skeptical of people who report UFO sightings.  I am not even sure this was a UFO but it was the type of thing where the second I saw it, I immediately realized it wasn't natural and chills ran down my back.
