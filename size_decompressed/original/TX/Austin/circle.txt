Up close sighting of UFO then confirmed by helicopter pursuit in Austin, Texas.;1989-09-15 21:00:00;15 minutes;Up close sighting of UFO then confirmed by helicopter pursuit in Austin, Texas. This is the first time I've officially reported my sighting.  I'm doing this because someone official must know. In the later part of 1989, at approximately 9 p.m., while driving home from dinner at my mother's house, I noticed bright lights moving very slowly toward my right, above the tree line.  I've always been intrigued by U.F.O's and feel I'm quite knowledgeable on the subject.  I had always thought that if I had ever saw one,I would not be afraid, but rather I would want to approach it.  Was I ever wrong.  I stopped to observe a round shaped disk coming my way above the trees to my right while still in my truck.  Slowly it approached.   Surrounded by very, very bright lights, not blinking lights but solidly lit.  At this time, the object is right by me so I get out of my truck, leave the door open, walk around the door to the driver's side fender and look at the craft.  When I realized there was no noise coming from it, that's when I knew what it was.  The biggest rush of fear went through me like I never  knew.  The craft was only about 50 yards from me.  I jumped in my truck, drove forward 200 yards, made a left, stopped and watched it slowly move away for about five minutes until I couldn't see it anymore.  My house was just around the corner.  I went in and woke up my roomate, ((name deleted)).  He went to bed way early because he had to go to work at 4:00 a.m.  I told him what I had seen.  He said I was crazy.  We went out front in the yard and I started telling him the story.  Just a few minutes into my story, as I was pointing in the direction of the sighting, we heard a noise from behind.  We turn and look.  About 3 or 4 black helicopters buzz the house and fly in the direction I'm pointing.  Steve didn't think I was so crazy then. I'm reporting this because lately it's been weighing on my mind.  50 yards is close!  If someone would contact me, I would like to tell them things about the craft and the amazingly effortless way that it moved. Please take this sighting seriously.  I am a business owner in Austin and have a reputation as an honest person. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Shortly after midnight on Monday morning February 9, 1998, I observed 9 or 11 glowing white balls in a V pattern traveling North in the skies above north Austin, Texas. I am not sure of their speed or how high they were, but I did get a good, clear look at them for two or three seconds as they appeared over a roof and then disappeared behind some trees. It was a clear night and the moon was almost full.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
low-flying, helicopter-sounding, aircraft or circle shaped (from underneath), and had  few lights + bright spotlight;2001-07-20 23:59:00;three minutes;low-flying, helicopter-sounding, aircraft or circle shaped (from underneath), and had  few lights + bright spotlight We were talking around the hot tub in our backyard when we spotted what we thought was a helicopter spotlight about three houses down. The light was stopped very close to the ground and we thought that it was a law enforcement helicopter searching for something. We walked up to the back porch thinking that there might be a criminal in the area, and stood by the door. As we watched, the light then moved towards our house and was out of my view (we were standing on the bottom deck). Once it reached the house, it came back into view. It sounded like a helicopter and my mom said that she heard it from inside her bed room. I never saw the actual shape due to the intensity of the spotlight, but when it came up to the house, we could clearly see the bottom of the object. It was round and with a few white lights on the bottom. It appeared to be a white, or light grey color. It flew over the house very slowly so that we had a good thirty seconds to see the bottom of it. It was a very strange looking helicopter, if that's what it was. The spotlight was very intense. It lit the pool area as it flew by. I'm normally very skeptic of U.F.O. sightings, and am not confinced that it was one, but would like to find something to explain this object. It was extremely low, sounded like a helicopter, shaped like an aircraft or circle from underneath, and had a few lights including a very bright spotlight.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Me and my boyfriend at 2am went outside to smoek a cigarette and he looked in the sky and asked what that was he saw.. so i looked.. and very fast across the sky three saucers flying at once, one in the back, two in the back next to one another. They were light grey colored, had no flasshing lights or lights of anykind. They kind of lit up themselves but in a light grey color. It was completely silent movement and they crossed the sky in abuot two seconds or less, shooting up and disappearing into the sky and clouds.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Witnessed a group of 8 or 10 high altitude glowing lights traveling at very high speed from north to south over austin;2007-07-22 00:15:00;45 seconds;Witnessed a group of 8 or 10 high altitude glowing lights traveling at very high speed from north to south over austin I was watching the sky tonight in the back yard when a group of 8 to 10 circular glowing lights flew by very fast, tevaling from north to south and disappearing in the haze of light of downtown Austin. The objects were flying very high and were totally silent. They originally were traveling in a slightly V shaped line, but as they flew over, the lights changed positions several times. I observed the formation for approximately 30 to 45 seconds, before losing sight.  They were definitely not traditional aircraft, as the were moving far too fast, with no blinking lights, and the the flight characteristics as the objects changed position were unlike anything I've ever seen.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Car size, metallic, round sphere seen out window by passenger of commercial jet over Austin, Texas.;2008-02-15 15:00:00;20 seconds;Car size Metallic round sphere seen out window by passenger of commercial jet over Austin, Texas I was flying to Puerto Rico with my girlfriend from wisconsin with a connecting flight in Austin I believe.  We took off from Austin and were ascending at an altitude of about 10,000 ft I would guess maybe a bit more since we're only about a minute and a half to two minutes in the flight.  I get nervous flying so I always need an isle seat so I can look out the window.  After a brief rest and trying to relax from the take off which is the most difficult time for me I decided I couldn't rest or relax so I sat up and decided to look out my window because this seems to get me out of my feeling state and into a visualizing state.  Well I look out and down to my left and there at about the 7 o'clock position and I would guess maybe 1-2 thousand feet below and about the same out away from the left side of the aircraft was a huge round metallic ball about the size of I would guess two Volkswagen cars on top of one another.  These are all fair guesses because without any! thing to compare it to it's kind of hard but the one thing I know for sure is the shape and color and the fact that it didn't belong there.  I always said I felt it had to be moving at a good speed because we were at lease it seemed not pulling away from it very fast.  I guessed we were traveling at about 350 still increasing and climbing so it's speed I would guess maybe at 200 because I did watch it for about 20 seconds until it was too far behind.  At the time I was not into ufo stuff so it wasn't a big deal but non the less I new it was odd and out of place. If it happened now I would be yelling for the others to look no doubt and I would be filming cause now I carry a camera.  Note that I'am an Major League Baseball scout and I'm trained to observe and pay very close attention to detail.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

The sky was clear with only a few stars;2009-02-04 18:59:00;5 minutes;It was right after dark, Wednesday,  February 4, 2009.  I had just let the dog out for a run.  The sky was clear with only a few stars visible and the moon was not up yet.  It was unusually quiet.  There were no airliners, private planes, helicopters or military jets in the sky at the time. I was alone, standing at the edge of the walkway, in the dark at my rural home, looking at the stars.  The only light was my yellow porch light which was 35 or    40 feet behind me.    I was looking toward the north west and noticed a large very bright round object moving toward me very slowly.  I thought it had to be either the ISS or STS so I ran into my house to get my binoculars so I could watch it clearly.  I also made a note of the time.  It was 18:59. As I watched the object approach I noticed that it appeared to be flying at an even altitude and it was traveling in a weaving pattern, moving from the left then back to the right.  The object made no sound.  It had no navigational lights and no FAA red and green strobe lights.  It emitted a steady white light.  I have no idea how far up this object was.  I had difficulty looking at it. It was so bright it hurt my eyes.  It did appear to be the size of a dinner plate  The object came to a dead stop right across from me and sat still for about 10 seconds.  Then it blinked out and moved to the south west, right above me.   Needless to say, I almost panicked and ran but I couldn’t move.  I was frozen and I could not breath.  I felt as if it was staring at me while I was staring at it.  I immediately thought, what is this thing and how can it see me in the dark?  It sat there for almost a minute, then it started moving again, to the south east, at a faster pace and in a straighter line.  When it was almost out of sight it veered to the left and disappeared.  I got my dog and ran into the house, closed and locked my door and looked at the time.  It was 19:03. I have lived either on or outside of military bases  my entire life and I have seen some pretty unusual objects in the sky and in the water, but I have never experienced this before.  I sincerely hope that I continue to see UFO’s, but only at a distance. I did not report this sighting to any law enforcement agencies but I did contact NASA in Houston to ask if they knew what this object might be.  They did not know but they did say that it was not one of their satellites.    Their satellites do not zig zag across the sky and they do not stop in mid air. I hope reading this helps anyone who has had a similar experience.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Very large neon green circle was seen right outside my window.;2011-05-14 23:00:00;3-5 seconds;Very large neon green circle was seen right outside my window. I was sitting on my couch (facing the window) reading a book.  A very large neon green circular light hovered close to my window for at least 3 seconds.  I got up from the couch, walked to the window to look out through the partially open blinds to see outside.  The light disappeared in the time it took for me to get to the window.  I went outside with a flashlight to discover where the green light had come from, but couldn't find anything and all.  The proximity to my house has me spooked.  We live a ways from the road, which is shielded by trees.  It is very dark outside, and we have no outside lights on. After I couldn't discover anything I went back to reading.  Then I saw it again outside a different window (the one next to where I saw the first light come from). I think I saw a cone shaped light towards the second circle, but I can't be sure.  As soon as I saw the second circular light it disappeared about 1 second later.  This time I had my husband go outside t! o check.  He didn't find anything. It has unnerved me a little, since there doesn't seem to be any simple explanation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

New Years Eve right at 12:00am, my wife and I were driving home from a friend’s house on I35 heading north just outside Austin TX.  All the fireworks were going off in the sky and I noticed that there were three to 4 orange circles/orbs high in the sky in the north direction.   I did not get a lot of time to watch them but they were moving around in close proximity to each other.  These lights were much higher than the fireworks.  There were a ton of fireworks going off that night.  From one vantage point from the highway I could see all of Austin and surrounding areas.  There were countless fireworks going off.  I am not sure if the fireworks attracted the orange orbs/circles.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Light on top left of moon, followed by white lights and jets.;2014-01-02 17:30:00;30 minutes;Light on top left of moon, followed by white lights and jets As I was driving up to my sister's house, I noticed  the young moon was visible on the rest of the surface, so when my girlfriend and I arrived, we went to go look from the yard.   Suddenly we were amazed to find a flashing light to the upper left of the moon.  I am not talking about Venus to the lower right. We stared at this light flash red, white, then seem to flare a beam off either at or directly away from the moon, occasionally going out for a second at a time. After about 10 minutes of this we noticed a few jets flying excessively fast, and extremely loud. These were not commercial, and had strange/irrelevant flashing patterns. We watched them cross our visible sky within a minute and one in particular changed directions 3 times . Due north, due east, then due west. Right after this we saw several strange objects, planes or otherwise, all heading due north.  We started looking to the south and saw two, non-blinking perfectly white circles. Going in straight lines, then vanishing. One went north east, and the first went north north-east.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Mueller Boulevard between 51st Street and Mueller Lake Park Circle.   Riding Capital Metro Bus #37 Southbound,  View was toward southeast to the left of my shoulder. I take the city bus to Mueller Lake Park to walk 3 1/2 miles early in the morning when the sun rises. This morning I saw a circle of red lights hovering above the horizon that look like the video above, except the lights were bigger and they were red.  I thought, Oh God ..... I turned to the right to see if there was anything  that could be making the image.  The  Dell Children's Hospital tower is in the background,  When I looked back at the circle it  turned on its side.  It looked like a paperclip circle on its side.    There was an extra light outside the circle to the right.  That light was faded and less defined.   The light  did not look like it was attached to the circle but  it moved at the same time the circle moved.  Then the circle disappeared.  It faded away -- it looked like it was going into another dimension.  It didn't shoot across the sky. The Capitol Metro Bus Driver might have seen it.  She is Black and wears a Fedora.  I'll ask her.  Pilots see UFOs.  Bus drivers probably see them too!;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Shape shifting circle of red lights appears in night sky over Austin.;2014-08-15 18:45:00;l minute;Shape shifting circle of red lights appears in night sky over Austin. I was riding a Capitol Metro Bus southbound on Mueller Boulevard toward Mueller Lake Park Circle, when I observed a red circle of lights bouncing across the sky.  The circle changed form to cylinder, then disappeared.  I was sitting on the left side of the bus near the window.  The lights were red. I listen to your reports on C2C Fridays.  My father was an ((deleted)) Airlines International Captain over thirty years.   I attended MUFON meetings at Austin History Center years ago. Tonight I saw a story on 10 p.m. KEYE NEWS about a circular UFO sighting.  They did not say that the lights were red.  My sighting had red lights in a circle that changed to a cylinder circle, then disappeared.  I thought it might be hovering over the Austin Bergstrom International Airport.  Then I thought, it might be a hologram.   Yes, it looked more like a shape shifting hologram. The sighting lasted about 15 to thirty seconds.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
2 orange lights and a giant white circle spotted in Austin, TX;2016-01-15 20:30:00;5 minutes;2 Orange lights and a giant white circle spotted in Austin, TX My friend and I were sitting on a rather higher spot in our neighborhood to gaze at the stars and just hang out.  After about a half hour of us talking about random stuff, I noticed a bright orange star looking thing at around 5,000 feet altitude..  But much bigger than a star.  When I first saw it I knew it couldn’t be a plane or a shooting star, it was too big and too bright to be either of those.  I pointed it out to my friend with a little alarming tone, and he shook it off as a plane. I tried to explain to him that it just couldn’t be a plane and he began to believe me after the object moved about 6,000 feet and vanished.  Now we we’re both at an alarming state.  We stared at the sky after that non stop and in a few minutes.  It re-appeared in its original location and did the exact same thing.  Moved a bit more this time and soon vanished again.  Now we knew we weren’t imagining stuff.   1 minute later, I spotted a huge bright white circle at about 2,000 feet altitude zooming past at immense speed. It immediately grabbed my attention and I showed my friend.  We watched it fly across the sky until it dropped past the horizon.  This thing was giant!  It’s not possible this was a balloon or any other man made substance...it just doesn't make sense.  Meteors aren't that big and neither are comets.  And I'm sure at that low altitude it would be on fire.  But not a perfect circle.   We have no explanation for either of these strange incidents but one more thing happened, soon before the white circle went out of sight a white firework light up at the opposite side of the circle without any sound which was kind of coincidental but I’m not sure that was anything of significance.  I know the circle didn't make the firework because it wasn't in the same location.  It just wouldn't have made sense.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
