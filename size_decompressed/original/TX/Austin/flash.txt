pulsing flash recurring at 2 second intervals 3 times along the same trajectory along 90 degrees of sky;2007-10-10 19:00:00;3 seconds;pulsing flash recurring at 2 second intervals 3 times along the same trajectory along 90 degrees of sky I was in my back yard with my son and his friend. It was almost complete sundown but the remnants of the sunset could be seen in the upper atmosphere. The kids were searching for fireflies, so I was scouting the tree canopy.  There was a flash of yellow light in the sky and I commented to the kids that I saw a shooting star. It lasted about 1 second.  As I continued to look up the same flash occurred along the same trajectory about 30 degrees to the left, and then again another 30 degrees, for a series of three yellow pulsing flashes lasting one second each, timed about 2 seconds apart. This object was moving extremely fast.  The interesting thing is, immediately thereafter a prop jet appeared at about 10,000 feet from behind the tree line from approx. the same point of origin heading perpendicular to the trajectory of the unidentified object, and immediately after that a large jet at approx. 30,000 feet appeared from behind the tree line heading in the opposite direction. The vapor trail from the airliner was highlighted by the extreme angle of the setting sun. The impression this left was of the object passing hastily between the headings of the two aircraft   As I watched the contrail, I asked myself if the flashes were some kind of natural artifact of the sunset, but my instinct tells me the object was real and traveling at a high velocity.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Bright Flash of Light Exploding In Austin Sky.;2013-10-19 22:30:00;10 seconds;Bright Flash of Light Exploding In Austin Sky Last night at around 10:30 pm my friend and I witnessed a very large, bright flash of light in the sky near Austin.  I was visiting a friend in Jollyville and saw the flash from the window of her apartment, the flash came from the downtown Austin area.  It was very bright green, and blue.  Circular in formation, and appeared as if something was exploding, then disappeared quickly.   We ran outside immediately after and it was as if nothing happened.  No sound, no smell, no reaction from any neighbors.  More people have to had seen this...  It was such a huge display, I've never seen anything like it.   I'm looking for answers on what it may have been but there are so far, no other reports from this night.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
