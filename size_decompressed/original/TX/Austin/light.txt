lights traveling across the sky at high speed, one stopped and became brighter;1972-06-01 18:00:00;5 minutew;lights traveling across the sky at high speed, one stopped and became brighter A friend and I were sitting on my porch watching the sky.  We saw three lights transverse 1/2 the sky at a high rate of speed (went the whole scope of the sky in a second or two).  on of the lights stopped abruptly and began to become much much brighter.  It then returned to its normal luminescence and exited the sky at the previous high rate of speed.  after this two more of the lights (looked the same as bright stars with the same white light) covered the whole sky at the same rate of speed.  going across the whole sky in a couple of seconds.  i will never forget this experience and have never seen anything like it since.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Floating red light over Texas-matches other reports.;1995-06-01 21:00:00;30 Minutes;Floating red light over Texas-matches other reports. Although this is an old report with uncertain date, I wanted to post it because it matches the one from Puget Sound from March 2007.  Austin, Texas, just after dark, myself and several people saw a red light similar to what would be on a tower.  It was to the South.  We were within a mile of Interstate 35.  We watched it as we talked as we knew there was no tower or anything there. We eventually noticed it was slowly moving towards us. It took a good 20 minutes to go from the horizon to overhead. There was no sound and no other light. It did not variate in brightness at any angle. It seemed to stop overhead, maybe 3000 feet or less. Just far enough that a spotlight could not hit it. It drifted like a hot air balloon in speed.  While watching, I called the ATC tower at the local airport.  They confirmed they could see it visually but did not know what it was.  After a few minutes it just turned off. 2 minutes later it reappeared in the exact same spot on the South horizon again.  When I called ATC again, they advised they now knew what it was but couldn't tell me. I told them they might ought to before someone shoots at it or something stupid.  It repeated the exact same path until it was right overhead again, and then just turned off. We never found out what it was. I just thought it sounded exactly like the other report.

While viewing M42 through telescope, we witness 3 anamolous moving lights, two with scope, one with naked eye, approx. 10-15 min. apart;1997-01-02 19:15:00;30 minutes;Summary : While viewing M42 through telescope, we witness 3 anamolous moving lights, two with scope, one with naked eye, approx. 10-15 min. apart. On the night of 1/2/97, at approximately 19:15, my husband and I were viewing M42 (in Orion) from our balcony through our 10 Mead LX200, with a 6.7-mm eyepiece.The night was clear, and we had never seen such depth of color in M42 before - it was beautiful.  I witness a small (star-sized) orange light travel roughly east to west(top to bottom of eyepiece) in about 3/4 of a second.  I immediately looked at that area with my naked eye, as did my husband, but we saw nothing.  Approximately 10 minutes later,my husband was viewing M42 with a 15-mm eyepiece.  He, too, witnesses a small yellow-orange light, traveling at the same apparent speed - although he describes its movement as erratic.Again, our attempts at immediate naked-eye confirmation yield nothing.  We continue to observe M42 in the hopes that we will see another light.  This time, we alternate: oneviews through the scope while the other observes M42 with the naked eye - at this point, we have ruled out satellites (erratic movement of the second light) and insects flying in front of our lens(none observed with naked eye - lights are in focus through scope - lights are visually quite small).  Approximately 10-15 minutes later (19:45), my husband is viewing through the scope,and I'm watching Orion like a hawk.  With my naked eye, I witness a white light, again visually star-sized, come out of the bottom star of Orion's sword, travel in a small curve or hook, and then travel at a visualangle of about 45 degrees.  It moves in a straight line until it is approximately under the right star of the belt, and it simply turns off.  This takes about 2 seconds.The previous night, my brother and his friend were over observing M42 and Betelgeuse (19:00) and reported seeing shooting stars through the telescope.  My husband and I are amateurastronomers, and have seen meteors, satellites, airplanes - all of the reasonable explanations.  These three lights do not fit in with those explanations.  We have attempted over the past few months to figure this out, but cannot.  I can only say that we both have had an unshakably strange feeling about these observations, and I decided that posting this sighting might bring other observers of this phenomenon to us.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Several lights appeared in the Northwestern sky.;1997-05-05 19:00:00;15sec;Summary : Several lights appeared in the Northwestern sky. My husband & I were doing some gardening when I noticed these lights in the sky.I told my husband to look, and we stood there for a good 20-30 seconds watching these things.There were about six or seven bright lights in a row.The top light was the brightest. It continued to grow brighter and appeared to be on fireor an explosion of some sort. No smoke was visable. The top light appeared to fall.Then the others seemed to fade away. There were never any unusual sounds. There were no vapor trailsor visable signs of debris.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
A bright red light in E/SE. Did not move as long as we watched.;1997-11-07 18:30:00;30 minutes;Summary : A bright red light in E/SE. Did not move as long as we watched. Leaving house to go to children's fair. We often look at the stars. I noticed an unusually bright red object in the E/SE and stopped to look. Thought it was Mars but too bright. Too high for radio tower. Blimp? Did not move for over 15 minutes. still there when i had to leave. Haven't seen since. Family watched. We are military brats so know aircraft. This was weird. My girls got scared because i kept saying that whatever it was it wasn't normal. I expected to see an article in the paper about it. A nova star? Perhaps it was the planets aligning that night? It had teh steadiness of a star or planet but it was very bright. At one point there seemed to be three interior lights, a little less bright. I thought it was my eyes but my wife and two kids saw it too. I went to California a week later and told a friend who said a similar light was reported in Santa Barbara on NOv 15 but it was reportedly a rocket launch. Maybe so, but what I saw was not a rocket launch.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Eruption of blue-white light in the sky followed by sweeping action and lesser blast of blue-white light, south, toward San Antonio.;1998-04-20 23:59:00;15 Sec.;Eruption of blue-white light in the sky followed by sweeping action and lesser blast of blue-white light, south, toward San Antonio. I was leaving a late night stop at the store and my immediate reaction was of a plane exploding 50 degrees up and almost due South. On second thought, no plane would produce this much light and this sustained intensity. I am an amateur astronomer and this *was not* a meteor breaking up mainly due to the sweeping up of light prior to the second and lesser burst of very bright light. Most interesting, last night Tue (21), Art Bell opened his show reporting a similiar light display from a San Antonio listener, precisely 24 hours after my sighting. Definitely plan to be outside and looking toward the south tonight at around midnight. Thank you.   -  Bob;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Hence, we consider him to be a qualified observer.  We have no idea what he witnessed, but we have several reports on file of multiple objects passing overhead in formation.   Please see article in Sky & Telescope, circa June 1960, regarding the Cyrillid Meteor Shower, which was observed in Canada and over the Atlantic Ocean on St. Cyrils Day, February 1913.  Dozens of brightly lighted objects were seen proceeding across the night sky in symmetrical formations over the course of several minutes time, and each formation was visible for several minutes.  Peter)) At 2:00am I observred what I thought was a single satelite moving north to south.Soon I noticed a multitude of these objects following the first and counted 74 of these objects on the same trajectory within the span of 53 minutes. At 2:10 am Sunday morning May  23rd,I observed what appeared to be a satelite traveling from north to south.It seemed brighter than most I had seen and made note of that to myself.Soon afterwards,I noticed three more of these same lights following the same path.Wow,I thought,looks like the space program got the funding they were after.At this point I scanned a 45 degree arc in the sky from due north to the northeast.I noticed a multitude of these objects within this frame of view.It struck me as very strange at this point and I decided to count the objects just to see if I might be able to explain what I was seeing to a meteorologist or scientist so I could know what the hell I saw.Then ,some of the objects started coming in distinct patterns.Some were triangles,others were following in a straight line. I started to get freaked out because I knew that satelites did not behave in this fashion.I looked to my right (toward the NE) and saw one object that was going from northeast to southwest.It suddenly shifted from that to a straight north-south direction.OK what the hell is going on here!?Some of the lights were very bright and had a bluish tint,others were more dim with a yellowish tint.they all apeeared to move at the same speed though I did see one that sped up and then slowed down.The sky conditions were partly cloudy there were no airplanes in the vicinity.It is interesting to note that they were moving the airport to a new location that morning to Austin Bergstrom International Airport.The airport is south east of me.The new one is even further southeast.At the old airport the planes would fly directly over my apartment at about 500-600 ft.As far as the planes they moved form the old airport to the new,they were flying about 20 of them and would not have gone over my building because the new airport is in the opposite direction.Which leads me to my final observation:I counted 74 fast moving objects  at high altitude for a total of 53 minutes.Does'nt seem conducive to what was going on during the move of the airports.My neck was starting to hurt after awhile and since I did'nt hear any explosions I assumed that we were not under attack and went nervously to bed.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
UFO spotted among group in Texas;2002-08-04 22:30:00;Approximately 10 minutes;UFO spotted among group in Texas A group of friends and I were hanging out in a friend's backyard, when I noticed a light that seemed to be moving.  The first few minutes, it seemed to be farther away, so seemed to be moving the way a plane would.  As it seemed to get closer and closer, it started getting brighter, and seemed to be pulsing.  As it got closer, I noticed that this object seemed to be hovering, as it was moving from side to side, in circles, etc.  There was no kind of noise at all, so I am sure that it was not any plane or helicopter that I know of.  One other friend spotted this as well, and we alerted the whole group.  We were all schocked and stared in amazement until the object suddenly shot in one direction and died of the pulsing light.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

After watching the object for approximately 3 seconds, it abruptly changed direction (from my perspective, 25-30 degrees difference in heading) and appeared to accelerate.  It then appeared to change direction again, this time appearing to moving out and away from the ground. Observer: student;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

They were all the same magnitude brightness and not one object.;2003-11-19 21:45:00;10 minutes;They were all the same magnitude brightness and not one object. While travelling west on Davis Lane before turning north on Brodie Lane in southeast Austin,Tx, I noticed a very bright starlike light to my south-southwest.  It appeared to be moving toward me at a reasonable rate of speed, comparable to a jet.  It did not have any flashing wing lights or any color lights other than just being a bright white light.  I really thought it was just a jet coming towards me on some sort of route to the Austin Bergstrom International Airport.  We are in that flight path for some approaches.  I was amazed at how big and bright it was.  It was not high in the sky but over the horizon by about 2 to 3 degrees.  I lost sight of it.  I then turned north on Brodie Lane, headed to work.  As I topped the little hill before entering the valley to my work, I noticed 5 bright white lights over what appeared to be downtown Austin.  I could see the capitol building and the lights were above and to the left, making it generally to the north of my position.  Three lights were in a triangular pattern with the legs being about the width of 4 fingers held at arms length.  If you look at an equilateral triangle, the other 2 lights were in line with the bottom of the triangle and to the right (east) about a finger's width, held at arms length.  All the lights did not appear to be moving.  The 2 lights to the left were all in line with the bottom of the triangle.  I lost sight of them as I continued north.  They were rather bright and all of about the same magnitude.  I called the airport police when I got to work and they said they had not had any other reports, at least tonight.  They said they have been getting several reports all month.  They said they would pass it along to the FAA.  They told me to contact your group.  Anyway, as I lost sight of the lights, I did notice a jet generally travelling from the south towards the lights.  I could not say if it was a military or commercial jet.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

I was looking off of my balcony, over the Lake Travis, and directly facing the 360 bridge.  Out of nowhere, a very intense white beaming light appeared in the sky, and was motionless for about 30-60 seconds. There was just one formation. It looked at least 5-10 times larger than a bright, twinkling star.  I walked inside, scared, as I had never seen anything like it before, and looked through the window.   Almost immediately after I got inside, it began to rise vertically.  This went on for approximately 10-15 seconds, and then it disappeared quite instantly.

Unknown Light over Austin, TX;2006-12-16 23:00:00;10 min;Unknown Light over Austin, TX I was out in my driveway talking to my girlfriend on the cell phone when I happened to see a star move from the East heading toward the West. At first I thought it might have been an airplane since aircraft do fly along that route on final approach to Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. This however just appeared like a star. I never blinked or changed color. After about 1 minute of viewing it stopped and remained stationary for about 2 minutes before proceeding on a N-NW heading. After about 20 seconds of that heading it changed and started heading SW coming to a stop again after about 15 seconds. It remained in position for about 2 minutes before heading W again. I then saw it stop and hold position for about 3-5 minutes. During this time, the clouds began to move into the area and altough they covered the stars, they only obscured the object. I believe it was either bright enough to be visible through the clouds or may have been in the clouds. I saw it proceed to head W again through the faint bit of light in the clouds and finally lost it after another couple minutes. I did not hear any sounds, witness any other lights or aircraft in the area. The next aircraft to fly in the vicinity did not arrive until about 20 minutes after I last saw the object. I also was unable to get the object on my camera phone because it blended into the stars too well.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
First one, then two white lights in the sky, visible in midafternoon;2007-03-08 11:00:00;20-30 mins;First one, then two white lights in the sky, visible in midafternoon At approximately 10:30 am on Thursday, march 8th, while walking alone in a field near Zilker park, I observed a very small white light standing motionless in the sky, almost directly above me and a bit to the north. I watched the light for approximately 20 minutes, during which time the object did not appear to move at all. Very suddenly there was a second white light that appeared to be hovering quite close to the first. I do not believe that this was an optical illusion, given that I closed my eyes several times to find the same set of lights in the sky when I reopened them. This second light appeared brighter than the first, and it was slowly moving within close proximity of the first light. Moments later it was gone all at once, only to return again a few minutes later. At this point I began to walk toward the nearest convenience store, and when I arrived there, I was able to point the lights out to a strange man who was getting into his car. Together watched the lights dance, and soon after they disappeared.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
UFO hovers over Lake Travis for 5 minutes, then speeds off.;2007-10-17 22:30:00;5 minutes;UFO hovers over Lake Travis for 5 minutes, then speeds off. While watching TV at 10:30PM, I glanced out my living room window and noticed two bright lights that looked about over Lake Travis, just to the right of Mansfield Dam.  They looked stationary, which seemed odd, so I got my 30 power binoculars out and went out on my deck to get a better look.  I watched these two lights for about 5 minutes which stayed at the same altitude (I’d guess about 2,000 feet) and parallel to each other.  They were rock solid and did not move up or down and stayed the same distance from each other.  I’d estimate they were at least 100 yards, maybe further, from each other and very large and bright.  The light emitted seemed elongated on the bottom side of the lights, so maybe the light of both was being directed downward.  There were no other lights such as colored navigation lights, strobes, etc.  I thought this was very odd.  I am very familiar with all kinds of aircraft lighting as I was an aircraft maintenance specialist (jet over two engines) in the Air Force.  This was no plane or helicopter(s) hovering.  All of a sudden, after about 5 minutes of observation, both lights slowly dimmed down to about 20% of the original intensity.  Then they began to move, one going lower than the other as if a very large craft in a banking turn to the north east.  It then moved to the east and I was amazed that this appeared to be a single craft, not two individual ones.  The lights still kept the same relative distance from each other and sped across the horizon in a matter of seconds, it was totally gone in 4 or 5 seconds.  I never was able to make out a clear structure, but believe it was a chevron or triangle shaped, by observing the lights and how they moved together.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Due south and located initially in Sagittarius, we spotted two, tiny moving objects heading directly north. The objects were very close together from our perspective, and moved – one in front of the other – about three times the speed of a satellite. We had just seen a satellite about 15 minutes before that, so it was easy to make a speed comparison. Just about when the objects reached zenith, both of us realized the two objects moved closer together and then began moving around each other. This continued until they were out of view, about when they were between Draco and Cepeus.  There was no sound accompanying the fly-over.  Their speed remained constant, and were no blinking lights, though their position relative to each other changed. Their visual magnitude (apparent brightness) was a 4 or 5. The sky was pretty clear – there ! were no clouds.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Small maneuverable craft w/ two blue-white lights over Austin, TX.;2013-01-25 23:15:00;15 minutes;Small maneuverable craft w/ two blue-white lights over Austin, TX At 11:15pm on the evening of January 25th, 2013, at least three people witnessed an unidentified object maneuvering at a very low altitude, estimated to vary between 50 and 150 feet, near the corner of Duval and 45th St. in Austin, Texas.  We observed from an estimated distance of about a city block away, perhaps less.  The sky was dark but overcast, no stars or moon were visible. No other aircraft were sighted during the occurrence.  The object was most definitely mechanical, and intelligently controlled. My impression of the object's size was that it was equivalent to or somewhat smaller than a helicopter, but I am uncertain.  The most significant physical feature was what appeared to be two blue-white lights in close proximity that seemed to quickly oscillate with yellow, looking like headlights. (Though they appeared as headlights, their apparent brightness remained relatively uniform despite three-dimensional maneuvering).  Somewhat higher and slightly offse! t from these was a smaller periodically flashing red light, but this was only intermittently visible, due I believe to the face of the object that contained the flashing light being turned away as it maneuvered.  Because of the lights' brightness and the dark of night, the actual shape of the object was difficult to make out.  The object made no sound, of jets or propeller blades, and left no contrails. The object's motion was most peculiar.  It was capable of great dexterity and unpredictability, sudden acceleration and stops, hovering, and a very slow controlled vertical descent.  It would shoot off very quickly in a straight line, stop on a dime, hover for about 30 seconds, then perform a very slow zigzag, stop and hover again for a period, then dip and weave off to another section of sky and repeat similar motions. At two points the object stopped in air, hovered, then very slowly descended vertically to disappear behind the roof edge of the apartment complex on the corner. It remained unseen from our vantage point for about 2 minutes, then unexpectedly came zipping back into view. For the entire period of observation, the object stayed within the same area, roughly a square city block. It did not appear to be following any conventional search pattern, but instead behaved very erratically.  I was waiting at the corner for a bus when I first noticed the object, noting it at first for the unusual brightness of the light and its low altitude. As I began to take photos with my phone (unfortunately, the camera is low-quality), a youth also waiting at the bus stop noticed and began to take video with his smart phone. As we continued to observe and document, marveling to each other and trying to identify the object, its motions became more and more bizarre, as described above. About 5 minutes into this, a resident of the apartment complex came by, noticed and commented on the strangeness of the object as well, but didn't stay for more than a moment. After about 15 minutes, the battery on my phone had gone out, and the object had disappeared beyond the roof's horizon for several minutes. As I traded contact info with the youth, the bus came I got on and left. I can confirm without reservation that the object I saw was neither a plane nor a helicopter of any type. I did observe a police helicopter performing a search later in the evening in a different part of town, and can report that the light patterns and motions of the two were absolutely dissimilar. I am a 29-year-old college graduate, history major. I work in education, helping to build websites for educational curriculum. I am not an active UFO hunter, and have never seen anything like this before. I don't know the fellow taking the video or his background, but he appeared to be about 18, and was just as flabbergasted as I was. The woman who observed in passing was most likely a college student, as that area is very close to the University of Texas. I am still waiting for word from the youth, hoping that he will send me the video to forward along. Unfortunately, the photos I did manage to get on my phone are pretty low-resolution, but if you zoom in on the bright blue object in the center of most of them, you will see the basic shape of the twin lights I have described.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Red and white light dancing and dipping rapidly over Austin for over twenty minutes.;2013-04-12 23:45:00;25 minutes;Red and white light dancing and dipping rapidly over Austin for over twenty minutes. I was in northwest Austin looking toward southwest Austin at 11:45 PM when I saw a red light and a  white light moving erratically.   They appeared slightly brighter than aircraft lights would be and each was a solid light.     They moved around erratically, and in particular would dip very suddenly, losing altitude quickly, then rise back up again, move around, then dip very fast again, and so on.  The best way to describe their movement was that it was similar to an insect flying, such as a fly or a bee, except for the very rapid descents and rises.    From time to time the intensity of their light would dim and then resume brightness.    After a few minutes the white light flickered off and was not seen again.   The red light continued its motions and would from time to time dissappear below the crest of a hill which was at least ten miles away.     I would estimate the red light was some distance further beyond the hill from my point, making it's brightness ! more than that of an aircraft light or lights.     After a while it dissappeared under the crest of the hill and I did not see it again, at about 12:10.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Formation of Red Lights Over Zilker Park.;2014-04-05 22:15:00;4 minutes;Formation of Red Lights Over Zilker Park. Last night, I was a passenger, as my husband drove north on Loop One from south Austin.  Approaching Bee Caves Road, I looked to the east over Zilker Park, and saw a series of red lights, most flying in a shallow U formation. Two of the approximate seven to nine lights were out of formation. The lights didn’t seem to be moving or moved very slowly while staying very near each other.  I’ve never seen aircraft fly so close together.  The number of lights caught my attention first and then the fact that they appeared so close together. The lights glowed a solid red and never blinked, as aircraft lights do. By the time we pulled into Zilker Park to watch, only three lights remained.  Slowly they blinked off one by one. About fifty yards away a man stood outside his car, dancing and screaming.  When he saw us he yelled, “Did you see that?”   My husband and I hurried to meet him and he said he had watched the lights for about ten minutes.  We saw them for about three to four minutes. The stranger, our new friend, said they first appeared on the southern horizon.  We both watched them travel to the southwest. He also said that twice he saw one light race to a second light and hover briefly before racing off at an unusually high rate of speed. My husband is sixty-seven and has practiced law for the last forty years.  I’m almost sixty, attended graduate school and was a stay-at-home mother.  Neither my husband nor I have ever seen anything like this.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

The three orange lights we're in a triangle formation until the middle light lined up with the other two lights.   Then they all started to move.  From the bottom to the top they slowly started to fade away as they look like they were descending.   About 15 to 20 minutes later we noticed one of the orange lights appearing in the horizon .  Shortly after another orange light and then shortly after another. the lights proceed into the sky and slowly faded away.  after seeing this I looked up UFO sightings on youtube and literally found a video of exactly what I saw, formation and all.  After looking up many UFO sighting I've noticed that the ones that are similar to the ones I saw are mostly sited by schools.  My sighting was over Paredes middle school in Austin, Texas.  I just thought it was a very weird coincidence.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Two Red Lights with Blinking White Lights Over Austin, Texas;2017-09-16 20:15:00;8-10 minutes;Two Red Lights with Blinking White Lights Over Austin, Texas I first noticed a single red light in the northwestern sky, about midway between the zenith of the sky and the horizon.  The light was steady and barely moving and was immediately unusual.  The light then began to move to the west quite quickly and steadily.  It continued like this, but in an unusual flight pattern, not like the normal ballistic trajectory of commercial aircraft.  My immediate thought was that it was a helicopter.  It would move west, then appear to pause (perhaps moving away or towards me) and then continue moving again.  It was hard to gauge its distance, but I’d say it was 10-15 miles away.  If that is true, then it was moving far faster than any helicopter I’ve seen fly at that distance. As it approached the western horizon, the red light changed to a white blinking light.  This light was blinking regularly, so once again I thought it must be a helicopter.  But at the speed it was going I began to think it was a fighter jet.  It was just about at the horizon when it nearly disappeared and immediately another separate red light appeared just to the right of it.   This red light was steady and even brighter than the first.   The second red light began to move to the north as the first was nearly gone. The second red light was moving toward the north and just suddenly, what I presume to be the first light, reappeared now as a red light with a white blinking light.  The two began to make their way northeast irregularly sometimes moving steadily, sometimes pausing or moving away from me.  The first red light seemed to now be following the second, and when they were moving laterally, they were moving quite fast.  The only thing I know of that could move that fast at that distance is a jet fighter.  But the maneuvers between steady lateral movements were far too acrobatic for a jet fighter.    In less than thirty seconds, the two lights—both with a steady red light at what I perceived to be the front, and a white blinking light at the rear—cruised to the northeast and then quickly approached the northern horizon.  Through trees I saw them pausing at the horizon as red lights and then disappearing below the horizon, not to reemerge again.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
