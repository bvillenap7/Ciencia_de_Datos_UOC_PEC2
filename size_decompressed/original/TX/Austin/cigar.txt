Needleship?  Bright straight line of light over Austin, Texas.;2000-07-01 16:00:00;00:15;Needleship?  Bright straight line of light over Austin, Texas. I was out on my patio deck smoking a cigarette, looking to the east, when I noticed a line of light, like a bright needle floating in the clear blue sky.  It was so high that I could see no details, and I don't think I would have seen it at all if it had not been perfectly perpendicular to the direction of the sun, whose light reflected brightly from its entire length.  Holding a ruler at arms length, the needle measured between 3/4 to 1 long. At first I thought it might be a jet, but all I could see was that single line of light, very straight and bright, no other details at all --no wings, no curve, and barely moving.  Yet a commercial jet's wings are approximately as wide as the jet's fuselage, and there were no wings visible, nor any interruption of the straight line of light where wings ought to have been. It was moving so slowly across the sky it appeared to be barely moving at all. I continued to watch it for about ten minutes, until the angle between it and the sun had finally changed enough that it no longer reflected any light in my direction. I'm an engineer who has flown commercially many times.  I know about how long a city block appears to be from cruising altitude -- tiny!  I also know how to calculate image length versus distance. So if this aircraft was at normal jet cruising altitude (7 miles), then it was at least 1100 feet long, more than four times the length of a Boeing 747 commercial airliner. Yet its apparent velocity was so slow that it appeared to be moving barely as much as its own length each minute, while jets cruise at 175 times their own length per minute. To stay aloft with wings at that height, it would have had to move at least 22 times its length per minute. So if it was human in origin, it could not have been flying with wings.  Therefore, it must have been in orbit. But if it was in orbit, then just how big was it?  That depends on how far away it was. If it was in low earth orbit (1,200 miles) then it was at least 37 miles long.  Which strains credulity.  Also, it moved much more slowly than any LEO satellite I've watched in the night sky.  But if it was just below geostationary orbit (22,000 miles) - say, at 20,000 miles?  -- Then its actual length was at least 625 miles long.  Which is ridiculous.  More -- In order for its surface to reflect enough light to be seen in full daylight, it must have been a mirror-bright cylinder.  And in order for that cylinder to have a wide enough surface for the reflected light to be very bright and obvious in full daylight, its width must have been at least 5% of its length.  Back of the envelope -- a craft only two miles long and 500 feet in diameter, with inner shells 20 feet apart, an inner core 100 feet in diameter, and assuming that the outer surface of each shell is the floor, has over 100 MILLION square feet of space.  Depending on how efficiently the ecosystem is organized, a ship two miles long could easily support 10,000 people, perhaps even more if the decks are closer together and the food/air/recycling farm fills its decks from floor to ceiling.  If the ship was actually 50 miles long and 2.5 miles in diameter with a core that was 0.5 mile wide, then it had 264 decks 20ft in height, with a total usable area of 62,000 square MILES.  The outermost deck all by itself is 392.5 square miles.  If the inner core were dedicated green space, it would provide over 78 square miles of park-like grounds.  The line of artificial suns running through the center to light the core park would be 1,300 feet overhead -- about the height of the Empire State Building.  Ridiculous for any purpose except colonization.  So, let's assume that it had anti-gravity to keep it aloft and stationary.  In that case it could have been at any height, though for the sake of discretion it would have made sense to be well above airliner cruising altitude.  In that case it might have been only 15 miles high, less than half a mile long, only a few hundred feet in diameter, less than 10 million square feet of decks, maybe a third of a square mile. Bear in mind that all the above calculations are extremely conservative.  In every case of between low A and high B, I chose A or less rather than an average of A and B.

Driving soutth on Mo Pac Expressway, I saw two black cigar shaped objects hovering.;2001-03-20 10:15:00;3-5 minutes;Driving soutth on Mo Pac Expressway, I saw two black cigar shaped objects hovering. Driving to work south on MO PAC expressway.  One the west side about a mile or two away, I saw two black cigar shaped objects hovering.  They looked like blimps.  At first I thought they were helicoptors but they were too high.  I drove into the parking garage and made my way to the opposite side of the building where I could get a better view.  The objects were gone but in thier place where three contrails intersecting to form a triangle around the area where I saw the objects.  One of the contrails had been formed by a jet that was still visible.  Once I made my way into work I looked out the window and saw another jet making its way to the same general area.  The objects couldnt have been blimps because the dissapreared to quickly and they couldnt have been helicopters becaue they were hovering pretty high and there were no visible rotors.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Long line of green rectangular lights in the hills of southwest Austin;2005-05-09 22:20:00;A few seconds;Long line of green rectangular lights in the hills of southwest Austin At 10:20 p.m. on May 9, 2005, I took my dog out into the backyard and sat down on a chair on my patio.  My backyard faces a street with a large empty lot across that street I live on the outskirts of Austin out in the southwestern hills area where there is a lot of vacant land.   As I sat watching my dog, I heard a small chirping sound and looked up.  Just across the street was a long line of green rectangular lights hovering about 60-100 feet over the vacant lot.  The object was close enough to me where, if it had been a blimp, I think I could have heard the engine which is quite noisy on a blimp.   After the initial small chirping sound, I didn't hear anything else coming from it.   I quickly grabbed my dog, ran inside, locked the door, turned off all the lights, and sat down on my couch shaking and praying that whatever it was was not interested in me or my dog.   After about five minutes, I sneaked over to my window and slowly raised one slat on the blind to peek out and it was gone.   I peeked out several times that night and the following nights and never saw it again (to my relief, I might add!).   I wrote down the date and time this happened to eventually report it to someone.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
White cigar shaped object hangs over Austin Tx then disapears in a flash of white light;2006-05-11 14:50:00;1 minute;White cigar shaped object hangs over Austin Tx then disapears in a flash of white light We saw a strange white object in the the clear blue sky.   It was large and cigar shaped just hanging in the air.  It did not seem to be moving at all so I pointed it out and asked What is that?  Then, all of a sudden, a very bright white light started in the center of it and got brighter and brighter then it was gone.  In the blink of an eye gone.  We did not see it go left, right, up, or down it was just gone.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Cigar shaped object seen over Austin, Texas flying from West to East;2009-11-06 16:05:00;90 seconds;Cigar shaped object seen over Austin, Texas flying from West to East This sighting of a UFO occurred on Friday, November 6, 2009 at 4:05PM Central Time.  It was while my daughter and I had driven into the McNeil High School parking lot to pick up my son after school that my daughter observed a strange object in the sky.  She asked me what it was as it was getting closer to us, and I looked at it carefully before responding because I didn’t want to make more of it than was necessary in case it was an identifiable craft.  However, upon close inspection, I could not see a tail fin or wings on what appeared to be a cigar shaped object, slightly larger in the front, and made up of two colors, orange and silver.  The object was moving from a West to East direction in a fairly straight line, about 2 miles up in the air.  I opened the car window to get a clearer view, and did not hear any sound.  There was no contrail or anything else to suggest this object was “normal”.  It was moving about the same speed as what you would expect an! airplane, except it looked much smaller than a plane, and as I said, did not have wings.  I managed to snap two pictures out of the car window (no glass or obstruction of the shot) which I'll be happy to send to you as a reply to acknowledgement of receipt of this report.  The camera used is a Canon PowerShot SD890 IS Digital Elph. A little while later, I did notice an airplane flying by on approach to Austin’s Bergsrom International Airport, and it was clearly much bigger and the wings were clearly visible, and the sound was clearly audible, a stark contrast to the unusual object we had just witnessed.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Rotating Object Moves Across the Austin Sky;2011-12-29 18:00:00;25-45 seconds;Rotating Object Moves Across the Austin Sky The object was seen moving across the sky in a southeasterly direction at a relatively low altitude.  It was traveling at roughly 30-45 mph.  The object was thought to be a bag but as it traveled across the sky its form never varied.  I followed it as far as I could into the horizon and I was able to see that the object was rotating horizontally much like a helicopter blade. The rotation speed was about once every second.  It is hard to describe the appearance of the object.  It was clearly visible in the early night sky, yet it was almost translucent.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Cigar (?) shaped object with roughly 7 dim lights flies over North Austin;2016-04-23 03:32:00;5-8 seconds;Cigar (?) shaped object with roughly 7 dim lights flies over North Austin It is 4:28 AM as I type this right now. At approximately 2:45 A.M. I decided to go for a late night walk on a nature trail near Walnut Creek in Nortwest Austin.  I stepped outside my front door and noticed an acrid smell, which I would describe as being like burning copper wires.  I could smell it for several yards until I got near to the trail, where the only thing I could smell was soggy Juniper and Live Oak bark. While heading back home after a walk up the trail, I noticed something in my peripheral vision in tne sky, at 3:32 AM.  I looked at it for 5-8 seconds. It was a very long, thin, and dimly-lit dark object with roughly 7 distinctly spherical lights on it.  I watched it fly across the sky and out of view (trees obscured my vision).  It appeared to be dropping lower as it zipped across the sky. I have no training in how to discern the size and distance of objects that are far away, but my intuition tells me it was roughly 1200 feet in the air, nearly a half mile away, and maybe 400 feet long. I must emphasize that this object was very dimly lit and that it would have been very difficult to see it the sky wasn't cloudless, and the moon as bright as it is tonight.  It was a very bright night.  The lights on this object were like weak LED lights. The object was moving from South to North at around 300-400mph over Walnut Creek Metropolitan Park and headed toward 1-35.  I was located near the St David's Medical Center building on the railroad tracks. I am 100% certain this was not a plane because it made no noise at all. The moment I saw the object I got an ominous sensation and the hair on my head and body stood up.  After I lost sight of it I immediately ran out of the trail and on to Park Bend Dr, and sprinted home. I would describe this object as being more like a drinking straw than a cigar.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Bright light split into 2 flying from NE to NW.  High above normal aircraft which we observed flying below.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-04 22:15:00;10 minutes;Bright light split into 2 flying from north east to north west.  High above normal aircraft which we observed flying below.  The bright light completely turned off and 2 seconds later the 2 red blinking lights appeared moving in the same direction.  The blinking lights moved much faster than the original bright red light.   The blinking lights then turned heading north in a curved direction.  Then it came back, heading northwest.  Then disappeared from our apartment view.   I knew it wasn't normal since I first spotted it.  I watch the skies all the time.

Cigar-Shaped hovering craft spotted near I-35 and 290 exit north of Austin;2020-10-01 08:50:00;5 minutes;Cigar-Shaped hovering craft spotted near I-35 and 290 exit north of Austin It was a cloudless clear day with the sun shining at around 8:50 AM. I was traveling from 290 heading west-bound onto the I-35 S exit ramp toward the city of Austin. Upon approaching the ramp I noticed a silver-like cigar-shaped craft in the sky to my right (North of the city - Northeast from me) that was not moving - or moving very slowly. At first, I thought it to be one of the many lightposts lining the area there when I realized it was further up in the sky and definitely not attached to anything and not in the shape of the lightposts.  It was hovering with no other movement and the craft appeared to be segmented. The craft was divided in half horizontally although each piece (top and bottom) were the same gray-ish color.  I kept my eye on it as I continued to drive up the exit ramp for a couple of minutes. I then had to look away to brake for the car in front of me on the ramp. When looking back, the craft had entirely disappeared from the entire sky-spac! e. The sky was clear so there were no clouds for the craft to disappear into and I did not notice any movement as it went away. I searched frantically to no avail. I checked the airspace/flight paths and did not find any craft in that specific area at that time. It did not look like an airplane at all.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
