UFO seen over Austin's  Robert Muller Airport;1990-10-15 23:00:00;4 mins;UFO seen over Austin's  Robert Muller Airport After a monday night football game, I stepped out on to the porch of my friends house which was just across the street from the city's international airport. I looked up into the night sky to see what if any stars I could see when I saw the following:  From my vantage point I could only see the shape of a square bottom surface about seventy five feet by seventy five feet and nine circles in a 3 x 3 grid. Each circle was protruding from the bottom like a squared edged donuts about 5 feet deep. All were the same size and equally spaced apart.  The object seemed to be floating above the south edge of the airport at about one hundred to one hundred fifty feet. It moved very slowly across the sky about five to ten miles per hour toward the west.  The object had no lights at any point during my viewing. The only way I was able to see any details at all was due to the light reflected from the surface.  I felt no magnetic or electrical fields, but I was never directly under the object.  As I watched the object float by, I moved to get a better view, it never picked up its pace or altered its altitude. I heard a door open and saw my friend come outside to say good bye to me, I ran up to her and pulled her into the street to show her. She did not see what I saw because as I showing her the object, it became blocked by the trees. I ran futher down the street with her in tow and although I could still see the object, it was hard for her to see it as it had no lights. I ran us back to the house and jumped in my car and tried to follow it but as it was not following a street it soon was gone from my sight as well.  I can give no reason why this airport would be of interest because as of now, it's closed down and a new airport is in operation. The only US Air Force base was just a reserve station at the time and shut down soon after Desert Storm. It became Austin's new airport.  I finally writing about this because I've never seen anyone else describe a square object, and I thought someone else may have seen something similar. It has always made me wonder exactly what it was that I saw. I know I'll never know but the experience was awesome. I keep looking up in the night sky to see what I can find.  As for me, I have spent most of my life around US Air Force bases. My father served and I served as well. For the first 28 years of my life I lived on or near a base. I watched SR-71's lift off from a California base, U-2's from a Florida base, I was on the Cape to watch a Shuttle launch, seen countless air shows, and once I saw a F-117 take off from a Texas base in broad day light. The F-117's profile was so strange I thought I was seeing my second UFO, but then it banked I saw the wing shape. My job during active duty was in electronics and communication devices, during my reserve years I loaded aircraft, C-130's to C-5's.  I like to think that I know aircraft, I've built many models and continue to keep up with new aircraft design, as best as an ex-military man can. Generally I know what I'm looking at when I look up into the sky but on this occassion I did not have one clue. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

I was sitting in history class in the eighth grade (four years ago) when I happened to glance out the window and see a large object about 50 yards in diameter floating over my neighborhood in the northwestern suburbs of Austin. It looked to be about half a mile away and moving slowly at a speed of 20 to 30 mph. It was only about 50 feet off the ground so I know that others must have seen it as well. The top and bottom pie plate-shaped portions of the craft were orange and the center cylindrical portion was yellow. I don't think it was metallic because I couldn't see any kind of a shine (and the sun was very bright at the time with no cloud cover at all). I blinked a few times to make sure I wasn't seeing things and then turned to one of my classmates to see if I could get another witness. When I turned back to look out the window 2 seconds later the object had completely vanished.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

My best description would be like a red plume shaped nike logo with a bright Star at the top.

My best description would be like a red plume shaped nike logo with a bright Star at the top. As i marveled at this the rest of the plume burst into bright stars (aprox. 12 to 15 of them) like the one at the top they simulteaniously got bright and then dimmed slightly but continued to shine inside the plume. I snapped out of it and thought to get my camera upstairs but when i came back downstairs the object was behind the tree line and not visible.

Looked like a bright green shooting star, much larger, longer tail and brighter than a SS, headed in dowward direction.;2002-10-16 23:06:00;1.5 seconds;Looked like a bright green shooting star, much larger, longer tail and brighter than a SS, headed in dowward direction. Last night traveling home on Highway 183 North my friend and I saw out the front windshield what could be described as a bright green shooting star.  It was different from a SS because it was mush larger and it was a lime-green color of light.  The diameter of the head of the SS was about 10 times larger than your regular SS.  It traveled in a downward direction toward the ground although it was still very high up.  It also had a longer brighter tail than a SS.  The color can best be described as a very bright lime green light almost neon in color. It was about as long as 6 full moons lined up in a row.  This is the second time I have seen this, once about 7 days ago in the southwestern direction from Austin.  It was the same description also headed down towards the earth.  How far away it was is hard to judge but it did not appear to be in outer space, more likely in the earths atmosphere.  It was very noticeable because it was so very bright and green.  It was very bea! utiful and unusual.  What it was I have no idea though.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Black square object seen over Austin Tx, Fall of 2002.;2002-11-01 01:00:00;15 seconds;Black square object seen over Austin Tx, Fall of 2002. This occurred last fall with low cloud cover and light precipitation so the object was highly visible silhouetted against the cloudy backdrop. The object was a black square shape and moved five times as fast as any aircraft I see fly over my house towards Austin-Bergstrom Int'l airport. The object was also very large and had no lights at all. After the object moved across the sky to my left and behind a tree I ran in to get my roommate and when I came back out it had moved straight up or past the large tree. This thing was unbelievable and I am hoping there were other sightings of this thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Slow-moving high-altitude object seen in Austin, Texas the evening of October 18th.;2003-10-18 18:45:00;20;Slow-moving high-altitude object seen in Austin, Texas the evening of October 18th. We noticed an object north of our location moving slowly to the west at very high altitude.  We used binoculars mounted on a tripod and noticed some smaller objects surrounding it.  The object appeared to be a large, white stucture, and our initial thoughts were that it was a weather balloon.  However, the object very clearly split into two distinct objects that slowly diverged to the north and south.  (These could not have been planets or stars, as they quickly faded during the sunset.)  We noticed a Southwest airline 737 flying due west underneath the object at around 7:00 pm, but it's unlikely the crew spotted the object as it was very, very high above.  We're very familiar with Venus, Mars, and the usual satellites, and this didn't resemble any of those at all.  Has anyone else seen this?  (Photos being developed.);30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Two red & green lights over SE Austin;2005-10-15 21:00:00;Hours;Two red & green lights over SE Austin Residents of a community off of Riverside Dr. told me to come outside and look at a UFO.  I was skeptical, but after repeated urgings went out to look. There were two stationary objects that were extremely bright and were lit up red and green.  The lits blinked on and off slowly then faded, then reappeared. I initially thought it was an airplane, but the objects did not move. Nor did we hear any sounds indicating helicopters.  There are no large antennas or anything like that in the area.  I have never seen this before nor since that night.  This went on for at least an hour and may have gone on longer because I gave up and went back inside.  Mars was out very brightly, but was in a different area of the sky.  I'd like to know what that was.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Floating Veil Austin, TX;2006-02-13 21:35:00;2 minutes ?;Floating Veil Austin, TX Was in backyard with dog, happened to look up and saw what I can only describe as a very large, long semi-transparent veil moving acrooss the sky, heading in a generally northward direction.  The movement of the veil was very smooth, flowing, and somewhat ripple-like.  I did not hear any sound, although it was close enough that if it had made any type of noise within human range, I would have heard it clearly.  It also did not seem to be illuminated the sky was light enough to see it moderately well (there are many streetlights and the moon was out as well). It was difficult to determine how high up it was - I was simply so shocked to see it and also was trying to determine just what I was seeing that I can't even guess.  It flew over the roof of the middle school that is approximately 20 yards from my backyard (north of my backyard the yard faces east). As the veil moved across the sky toward the school, my dog started barking and ran to the north side of the fence with ears and tail up, but she was looking toward the school rather than up at the object.  The neighbor dogs also started barking at that time.  I then went back into the house, out the front door & looked down the street (runs north, past the school) but saw nothing at that time.  Decided I needed to tell someone, so called my sister.  While chatting, about 10 mins later, a cop car drives slowly down the street in front of the house.  I use italics because by the time I got the front door opened & turned the porch light out so I could see, the car had reached the end of the block (also an intersection for a street that runs east/west.  The school sits at that intersection, as well), and I could only see that the shape and size resembled a police car.  It did have lights across the top, but they were white.  Interestingly, another similar car was waiting at the intersection.  After a short pause, they both continued on the north-running street, shining spotlights on the outside of the school.  They continued north on the street.  I went back into the house (still on the phone, telling my sister the events as they transpired), then again to the backyard.  After another 10 minutes or so, an airplane flew over the school, fairly low and slow.  It did not fly north, but rather toward the east and then south.  Thanks, and would be curious to know if others saw anything like this that night.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Object was appearing in different places of the sky, changing magnitudes, and other bizzare behaviors.;2008-11-09 19:00:00;8 min;Object was appearing in different places of the sky, changing magnitudes, and other bizzare behaviors. My Mother and I were just about to lay down on our pool deck for a cigarette and star gaze as we usually do after dinner.  As I lay down on my lawn chair (which are facing west) and looked up I saw an “unusual” object moving in the sky. The reason it caught my eye was because it was very bright but seemed to be very far away. The first thing I did was yell to my mom, “What the hell is that?” She looked up just before the object moved behind a small cloud. As it came out on the other side of the cloud it was no longer as bright as it appeared. It kept moving North (so as we lay there it look like it was moving left to right) just a little bit above Vega. After traveling for about 7 more seconds it slowly disappeared. At this point we thought that we were just looking at a satellite that, for some reason, appeared to very bright (a magnitude grater than -1) for those few seconds above us. To describe the type of light that it was giving off I used this analogy. When you are driving at night and cars are coming toward you, you notice that the head lights are sometimes a yellowish and on newer cars are more of a “neon white” if you will. The object in the sky looked more like the “neon white” headlights and the typical star and satellite look more like the yellowish headlights. Approximately two minuets later at 19:02 the same bright “neon white” object appeared right above us again, but his time was going the opposite direction so more towards the south west. It then looked to change its course again so now it was heading almost directly South. At this time my mom and I started to really question what we were seeing because satellites do not change their direction from heading north to heading south. As we watched the object  move “down” we kept saying to each other “what the hell is that?” it finally went out of sight. My mom told me that she was going to go get her binoculars, but I said, “screw that we needed a video camera, my phone (to know the time), and my journal (so I could write down what I was seeing while it was still fresh in my head), and a blanket. She was gone for about 5 minuets. As she was walking up the pool deck stairs, at about 19:08 now, she asked me if I had seen it again and just as she asked me that I was looking off into the western sky below Vega but above Hercules and saw a much dimmer object that looked more like a satellite but it would appear then disappear and it did this about 5 times before it did not reappear again. What was strange was the time intervals in-between the appearing and disappearing was not constant and the light was more of a reddish light not the same “neon white” as before. After watching this object and its many different behaviors, I can not say that it even remotely resembled anything that I have ever seen in our night sky before. It was not an airplane because airplanes stay on one direct path, it was not a satellite because however satellites do sometimes seem to be going in and out of vision, they do not change there apparent magnitudes as drastically as this object did. I think that it is also notable that from the time my mom and I were on our pool deck (19:00 to 21:00) we saw 4 big meteors and 1 huge meteor in which we could see smoke and debris on its tail. I am a college student here in Austin and spend a lot of time studying the sky and weather I believe this was an “alien space craft” or just an object that I myself could not identify, is in my opinion, irrelevant. But if there is a rational explanation for what my mom and I were seeing I would love to know.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
BALL ON THE HORIZEN;2009-03-06 00:30:00;30 min;BALL ON THE HORIZEN It happen one first week in 3/09 btween 12:15-12:45 am.I was at work,had to go to another building to get clean linen for folks in my building. I was busy getting linen,when I looked out on the grounds an saw a round object with a orange probing light. I watched it for a bit,when it stared to roll down the grass along the sidewalk a bit than stopped. So I went back to what I was doing.                                                                     When I got done, I thought I would go check it out an if it was a toy I would take it with me.                 I stared towards the object,when something told me to go back to my van, which I did.                          Once in my van I rolled up my window an started it up, an I sat there a bit an watched it. It turned towards me still rolling on the ground.             I started to move an made a turn, an the object rose up off the ground no higher than the window on the drivers side.At that point if I had le! t my window down I could have touched it, or it could have come inside the van with me < no thanks>             It was a bit smaller than a socker ball.   At that close range I could see it had like hawk wing spread out design all over it except for right in front were the pulsating orange light was comming from.          I took off an it started to follow me right behind my van.  When I got back to my building I didnt see it any more.                              Around 5:00am I saw a very bright light light out in the parking lot. I dont know if it had anything to do with the object I saw or not.                           A day or 2 later at the house where I live,there were 2 strange tornada shape things growing in my yard. I have never seen anything like it before. I had asked 3 diff people to come by and look to see if they knew what they were, but they didnt know either,they hadnt never seen anything like them before either               One of the person touch it and said ! it felt like it had a grease texture!  I know it sounds weird but I beleave it all had to do with the object I had a very close encounter with.              I have seen U.F.Os ever since I was a teenager an have never been scared an I have had some very close encounters with them.  But this was different some how.     The object made no sound.

A crescent shape UFO flying 6,000 feet above my head;2009-11-16 21:00:00;1 second;A crescent shape UFO flying 6,000 feet above my head It was on this night, November 16, 2009 I was outside cleaning an aquarium and took a small break to star gaze.  The porch light was turned off so I could get a better view of the sky.  It was lightly cloudy and the wind was at a light gust.  As I looked upward at the sky, I noticed a faint dark, grey haze that zoomed overhead.  The crescent shape (rounded side flying forward) must have been flying at least a thousand miles per hour to achieve the speed it was going.  It was out of view within a second.  The inner portion of the crescent had a slightly brighter grey hue that was almost difficult to distinguish from the color of the clouds, unless the object was in clear sky areas.  I assume that this was the propulsion agent burning off.  The object I saw was judged to be roughly 6,000 to 15,000 feet above the ground.  Judging the size of the crescent, its wingspan was roughly 800 feet.  This would make the length of the craft (from center of crescent, front to back) was close to 300 to 400 feet.  The thickness of the hull (top to bottom) was possibly 100 to 150 feet.  Its coloration was very close to the coloration of the sky itself.  When I saw it, it appeared to be a trickery of light adjustment, but it was there.  And it did fly overhead. The only light emitted was the;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Over a dozen drone-like UFOs witness over Austin, Texas;2010-10-15 16:30:00;1 Hour;Over a dozen drone-like UFOs witness over Austin, Texas On October 15, 2010, at 4:30 pm, four construction workers in north-central Austin, Texas witnessed a thin drone-like craft heading West in a straight line at an estimated 3,000 feet in the air. The craft had a solid white sphere on both the left and right sides and was held together by a thin black rod in the middle. The craft swayed as it flew at a moderate speed. A few minutes later, another identical craft followed the same route. As the hour progressed, up to 14 followed in the same area of the sky. No more than two flew over at a time. Toward the end of these sightings, a short rod-like object was sighted headed in the same direction, at the same height. It looked similar to a thread from a spider web. Two military jets were seen at an estimated 30,000 feet above the objects heading in the same direction, but it was unclear if the jets were aware of the object's presence. The last objects to be seen were small white dots that were spotted flying irregularly at a quick speed. They were much higher than the average commercial aircraft. The sightings ended just after 17:30 PM, three separate types of UFOs witnessed.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
