My husband and I spent a week in Austin at a TimeShare condo on Lake Travis in a subdivision called Lakeway.  As we sat on the porch facing east my husband was identifiying birds flying along the lake's inlet.  There were jets flying to and from Austin's airport, formerly Bergstrom Air Force Base, and even light planes were flying over us intermitantly. My eye was drawn to a very bright white object which suddenly appeared to the right of the area we had been watching.  It was flying rather quickly to the southeast at four to five thousand feet. The western sun reflected on the object and we were able to see the side of a large cylindrical object with a very distinct round, flat rear end, also bright white.  We were not able to see the front of the craft from our vantage point.  After about thirty seconds we saw the round rear of the craft enter the only cloud in the sky and we lost sight of it altogether.  There was no noise made by the craft.  The two areas in which my husband and I disagree is the angle in which the object flew, he says at a tilt and I say parallel to land, and what the front of the craft might have looked like.  My husband believes the front was flat and I just couldn't tell because the object appeared suddenly and was past our point of determination.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
red,blue,green cylinder or egg-shaped craft directly over central Austin, Texas;2014-06-19 23:00:00;10 minutes;red,blue,green cylinder or egg-shaped craft directly over central Austin, Texas twice now, my apartment mate and i have seen an egg/cylinder-like craft flying at an unknown height and moving silently and swiftly coming to a full stop without slowing down, making crisp right angles and ascending and descending with tremendous acceleration.   The first sighting occurred at 23:00hrs (CST) on Thursday, 06/19/14, and the second sighting occurred an hour later on Saturday, 06/21/14.   The object displayed  red, blue and green colored lights that would slowly dim and brighten.  At first we thought it may have been a police helicopter but it had no beacon, no searchlight nor any sign of a forward light and it moved so effortlessly, guickly and silently through the sky. on both occasions it flew over central Austin, heading south and then north finally descending east of Interstate 35 resulting in its disappearance behind our nearest treeline.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
