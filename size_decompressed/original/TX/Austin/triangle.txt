Large Triangle over Austin Texas 1979;1979-11-15 21:00:00;20-30 seconds;Large Triangle over Austin Texas 1979 In the winter of '79, a friend of mine and I were walking along the campus of The University of Texas in Austin. It was dark out, being aprox. 9:00 in the evening. I would estimate around 30 people were also in the area that I could see with folks on both sides of the street we were on. What got my attention was the whole area lighting up suddenly as if someone had turned on amber colored floodlights that illuminated the street and buildings as if it were suddenly day. The origin of the light came from above us. There, hovering above the UT Tower was a triangular shaped craft aprox. 100 yards in length with amber colored glowing half-bulbs at each corner underside of the craft. It made no noise and hovered for about 20-30 seconds. Everyone on the street saw it and we all pointed at it. I was very excited and the feeling I had was one of pure elation. The object moved silently towards the south and downtown area of Austin and then seemed to accelerate and was out of sight within a fraction of a second. The next day on the local rock radio station KLBJ, they announced that if anyone had seen anything unusual the night before it was because the Air Force was testing something. I later became a weather technician for the Texas Air Guard and even though I was already familiar with most military craft I became an expert at recognizing all atmospheric phenomena and different types of aircraft as was required by my job. I do not believe nor have I ever believed that this huge, silent golden triangle was of a terran origin. I have only found one other witness online to this event who saw it 30 miles to the north of Austin and he stated that he saw several small shapes flying around the triangle as it headed south towards the Austin area.

Huge blasts of spinning lights (3) scanned at least an acre of land until they zeroed in on us and chased us under a tree where we hid.;1991-07-08 19:00:00;6 min.;Huge blasts of spinning lights(3) scanned at least an acre of land until they zeroed in on us and chased us under a tree where we hid. Me and a freind were out at Lake Travis having a chat about sience fiction stories when I noticed a slow moving light out of the corner of my right eye. It went silentley through the trees then dissapeared.  I thought it was a car so I ignored it. Suddenly 3 gigantic spotlight beams blasted from the treetops and began scanning the ground, they were spinning in huge sweeping search patterns. We were awestruck and wide-jawed and then one of the 10 foot wide beams scanned us passed us and immedeatley swept back on our bodies. Both other search beams then shot on our bodies, we were completley exposed and frightened.  We ran, hearts pounding and completley freaking out under a tree, where the lights followed and shone through the folliage for a horrifing breif period of time. I think I was praying by then. The lights shut off with a klunking sound and we each fealt safe that we were not going to be harmed.  We walked out from under the tree and saw a large triangular shaped object floating over our heads. We watched it drift off over the glistening water as it made a very low frequency humming sound. There were 5 lights on the back of the ship that blinked in sequence from right to left one at a time, very slowly and methodiclally, amber in color.  It drifted ever so slowly over the silent surface of the water for several min. untill it faded into the horizion.  We both went back to our park bench, sat down began talking about what we had been talking about before like it had'nt happened. 20 min. later I remembered what had happened and asked my freind, what was that? and the said oh, you mean that ship? I said yes then he said I don't know. How did we forget what had happened? How did we remember? I was always affraid to let this information out to the public but now I know that my story is a dime a dozen.

Triangle shaped, low-flying, slow, silent Stealth fighter sized object with a red, revolving light on bottom.;1996-09-13 20:30:00;3-4 minutes;Triangle shaped, low-flying, slow, silent Stealth fighter sized object with a red, revolving light on bottom. I am a high school graduate(1976) and one of my favorite classes in high school was Astro-science. My high school had a planetarium built into it and it was always an interesting experience to look forward to everyday. I had an interest in space and always watched televised NASA events. In december of 1995, I finally broke down and bought a 4.5 reflector telescope from a department store. I suddenly became an avid sky-watcher. I bought software to show me where the planets were and started a sketckbook to draw the planets as I was seeing them through my telescope at certain times. I would write the times and dates below the sketches. I was lucky enough to see comets Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp and a couple of lunar eclipses which I added to my sketchbook. I could point out Jupiter and Saturn and sometimes Mars with my naked eye as well as star clusters such as the Pleiades and nebulas like the one in Orion to friends and co-workers. As I became more aware of just how immense our universe is, my interest in U.F.O.s came to the forefront. I read many books of sightings and have amassed a library of video tapes and books on the phenomena. I was wishing to see one for myself. On Sept.13,1996 I got my chance. At that time in my life, I was delivering pizza for a living and my sighting happened while on a run. I added it to my sketchbook 2 days after I saw it. It is from these notes and my recollection that I now relay the information to you. It happened in the southern-most part of Austin near the intersection of Slaughter and Manchaca. I was driving east on Slaughter lane and crossed Manchaca road and made a right turn onto Bilbrook. Now facing south, I looked in the sky for Jupiter, but the sky just was not quite dark enough to see it yet. I made another quick right turn onto Slaughter Creek drive, a long dead-end road which is where the delivery was going to. Now I was facing west and I saw a bright headlight up in the air and not all that high. I assumed it was a Cessna airplane which I had seen flying in the area before as there is a farmer on Slaughter lane that has his own dirt airstrip and I had seen him flying many times. The light was coming toward me, flying east as I was headed west. As the space between us narrowed, I became aware that it was not the Cessna that I thought it was and I could not identify what kind of plane it was. It was then that I saw that it was a triangle. Curious, I pulled to the side of the road and looked up through my windshield at the thing. What is that? I said out loud. It was flying slowly and low. I could not take my eyes off it. How can that be flying? I said outloud again. With my car still running, I stepped out of my car and just watched this thing glide overhead. It was after sunset but the sky was not quite dark yet. I became aware that this was my U.F.O. I did not know what it was, how it could be flying,it was to me an unidentified flying object. It was a dark (possibly black) triangle, the trailing edge being a little shorter than the other two with the bright headlight being at the front point. There was a revolving red light on the bottom encased in a glass dome and I remember thinking of a fire engine light. There were two or three other smaller white lights on the bottom shining straight down but they were not that bright. It was heading to the east,parallel with Slaughter Ln. at about 45-50 m.p.h.and there was no noise coming from it that I could hear. It was approximatly 100 yds. to my south and approximatly 300 yds. up. As it flew past, and as I was now looking at the rear of it, I could see a pair of small stabilizer wings on the top of the rear section just like a F-117 Stealth Fighter has. I looked at my watch, and even though I did not make a note of the exact time, I now know it was very near 8:30 p.m. I stood there and watched it slowly glide away over the nearby roofs of a neighborhood until I could no longer see it. I got back in my car and made the delivery and contemplated what I had seen. I was familiar with most planes but I never heard of one that flied so slowly without sound. I thought it might be a Stealth Fighter because it was about the same size, but the shape was not right. An F-117 is triangular, but not a triangle. From my vantage point, it appeared to be a flat triangle gliding through the air. There were no navigation lights (red on the left, green on the right) although, I could not see the entire right side. I wanted to tell my friends when I got back to the store but I did not. I always thought if I ever saw a flying saucer, I would tell everyone that they are real. Now I understood why people hesitate or just keep it to themselves. I hope I have given you enough information to help out in some way. I never reported it and was kind of scared to tell anyone for a while. When I finally showed my sketch of the object and the notes I wrote to one of my friends, he kind of looked at me strange. I know he did not think I was lying, and it seems to me that he thinks I was mistaken about what I saw. But it was completly unknown to me. The only reason that I do not think it was alien , is because of the revolving red light on the bottom and the stabilizer wings on the rear. But still, I was pretty exited and I am glad that now I can tell you about it. Thank you.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
It was floating right above the tree tops over the houses about 75 feet from the tops os the houses.;1996-10-15 03:00:00;5 minutes;It was floating right above the tree tops over the houses about 75 feet from the tops os the houses. I was driving in the area of the Mountain neighborhood when I saw it in the diatance.  It came slowly along the path of the street and I pulled over to stop.  I got out of my car and watched it.  It was a triangle shape and dark silver in color about the size of the houses there.  There was no noise at all.  How can something that size stay in the air when it's going so slow?  I was going about 25 mph on those winding roads and it was going slower than me.  I watched it float away, drove home and reported it to the government ufo people.  They said they would send someone over to take a report but they never did.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
I was driving northbound on I-35, and was around 5 miles south of Austin when I noticed an intensely bright white light far ahead on th;1997-04-07 17:00:00;30 mins;I was driving northbound on I-35, and was around 5 miles south of Austin when I noticed an intensely bright white light far ahead on the horizon line, directly in front of me.  It was the brightest and most white light I’d ever seen (and still have ever seen to this day, some 12 years later).   After a few minutes I realized it was still there, directly in front of me, maybe 20 miles ahead.  It was very low on the horizon and now I started to wonder what it might be.  I discarded aircraft because there are no headlights this bright, and even if they were, they’d have to be flying directly southbound over I-35, which I doubt they’d do.  I thought it might be a commercial spotlight that somehow had been pushed downward, aiming straight at me, but I couldn’t see any beam projecting from the source.   I was traveling around 70mph and getting closer to it by the minute.  After about 10 minutes I realized that the light was not stationary.  It was slowly moving westward, to my left.  I was really mesmerized by this thing now, and couldn’t for the life of me figure out what it could be. When it got much closer, I pulled the car over, turned off the engine and got out.  The craft was triangular in shape, and maybe the width of two to three 737 planes wing-to-wing.  What first struck me was that it was completely silent.  If the light hadn’t attracted my attention, you never would have known it was there.  It was slowly moving, almost drifting, south-westerly, maybe 500 feet off the ground.   The other thing that struck me is that now, from underneath, I could no longer see the white light, but instead saw 3 different colored lights, one on each top of the triangle.  One was red, one was green and the other yellow, all solid. As I stood in awe, a patrol car pulled off the road onto the shoulder coming southbound.  The officer got out and stood looking up at the craft, just as I was doing.  I jumped back into the car and drove right thru the grass, crossing the median and onto the southbound side.  While this was completely against the law, the officer and I didn’t even discuss it.  We just stood there staring at the craft. Now, as it was moving away from us, we could no longer see the 3 colored lights on the tips of the triangle.  All you could see from the back was a much larger, round red light in the center of the craft that was slowly pulsating.  I couldn’t make out how tall the craft was, just the approximate width.  The slowly pulsating red light was almost hypnotic, but our attention was broken by the arrival of a 2nd patrol car, this one the State Police.  He too got out and watched the craft moving away.  I asked them if they’d already checked with Austin-Bergstrom airport, and they had, reporting now commercial traffic anywhere near here or anything like what we were seeing. After a few more minutes of the two officers discussing their confusion and fascination, I jumped in my car and headed back down I-35 from where I’d just come.  I chased the craft for a few more minutes, driving about 70mph again, as it was now getting further and further off to my right (westerly).  I finally pulled off the highway and tried going down a side road to head more westerly, but by then it had disappeared from sight. I didn’t see anything about it in the papers, despite looking thru the Austin American Statesman for days afterwards.  I wish I’d gotten the names of the officers who witnessed this with me, but I didn’t.  I was too taken by what I was seeing in the sky.

Traveled East/Northeasterly. 7 white lights, not flashing. Saw a trianglular lighted object. Seven white lights-non flashing. I was facing West  think it was traveling East/Northeasterly, at a moderate rate of speed.  I saw a small airplane just prior to that, flying Northwesterly, with obvious plane lighting, red/green light on the wing tips and white lights on the wings.The triangular objects lights were very bright and as it began to fly over my left shoulder, one of the lights shown down brightly into my eyes.  These lights were much brighter then normal aircraft lights.The object appeared to be several thousand feet high.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

I exited the Doubletree Hotel, on IH 35 north, central Austin, looked up and saw the craft. It was motionless, silent, huge (like something 8 inches across, held arms length).I stared at it for about 3-4 minutes, awestruck, then became afraid, ran to my car to leave. I felt that the occupants knew I saw them, were aware of my thoughts, & that scared me. The sky was still dark but it showed up well, the white lights were so bright and reflected on the body of the craft. The red central light was a little smaller that the corner lights. I don't know how long it was there, since I left after a last glance at it from my car window. It was real, very real, and I never forgot it.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Triangular shaped object moving from north to south.  Object was barely discernable from the night sky.  Leading edges faint orange. No;1998-10-08 21:12:00;10 seconds;Triangular shaped object moving from north to south.  Object was barely discernable from the night sky.  Leading edges faint orange. No lights or sound. I was outside in my driveway lying on my back in order to view the evening meteor shower.  Suddenly, I noticed an odd looking triangular shaped craft moving at the speed of a commercial airliner flying directly overhead.  It was very faint, barely discernable, had I not been attentively focused on the stars I probably would not have noticed it at all.  The object obliterated any starlight behind it as it silently glided from north to south.  The leading edges of the object had an eerie faint orange glow.  No lights were visible on this craft.  I often watch the night sky and must say that I have never seen anything quite like this.  It was exciting to see.  The object moved behind a tree and I jumped up to see if I could reestablish a visual contact.  As I expected, once the visual contact was interrupted, I was not able to focus on it again. I did notice the red light of an aircraft in the vicinity but probably at a much lower altitude than the object.  This aircraft certainly was not in pursuit of the object and was moving almost perpendicular to the object trajectory. I called the sighting in shortly therafter to the National UFO Reporting Center.  I was quite surprised but at the same time elated to find myself speaking directly to Peter Davenport, Center Director.  Having heard him speak in the past as a special guest on the Art Bell Show, I recognized his voice immediately.  After phoning in the sighting, I returned to my post, hoping to see more, but there was nothing but stars once again.  I thought about what I had witnessed, and wondered if I would ever see something like this again in my lifetime.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Triangular object w/three hemi-spherical 'projections' from the bottom, travelling N-S reflecting pink glow of city lights.;1998-11-16 02:30:00;5 seconds;Triangular object w/three hemi-spherical 'projections' from the bottom, travelling N-S reflecting pink glow of city lights. I was watching the Leonids meteor shower of 11/16/98, approximately 2:30 AM +/- five minutes.  As I watched one meteor directly overhead, the meteor trail crossed the path of the object. The object appeared to be triangular in shape, with three hemi-spherical projections from the bottom.  Imagine three silver ballons with their stems tied together.  It was about the size of ones thumbnail if held at arms length, or the distance between any two of the three stars that make up Orion's belt.  It's leading edge and the leading portions of the projections seemed to be reflecting the pinkish color of a nearby streetlight, or possibly the glow from Austin, but it did not seem to be creating any other light of its own.  The wind was a dead calm and it made no sound. It was moving extrememly fast.  I approximated that it would travel from horizon to horizon in about 10-15 seconds.  I saw it first when it was almost directly overhead, and watched it for about five seconds before it was obscured by a house.  During that time it travelled N-S along a line from Polaris passing roughly between Leo and Orion. I felt it might actually be three silver ballons that someone had let go, or possibly a set of weather balloons, but the object was moving very fast and the wind was a dead calm.  I continued to watch until 3:00 AM but saw nothing else except meteors. I am an amateur astronomer with a degree in Physics.  I am very skeptical about what I saw, but I have no explanation.  I have to count out normal balloons or weather balloons due to the extremely fast movement of the object and the lack of any wind whatsoever.  I was very startled to find a similar report in your database dated 10/8/98, also in Austin.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
UFO Sighting in Austin TX Over UT/Capital Night Before 9/11;2001-09-10 19:00:00;5 Seconds;UFO Sighting in Austin, TX, over UT/Capital Night Before 9/11 I have kept this a secret for many years because I never knew what to do with the information.  I always thought the experience was awe inspiring and that the timing of the event was extremely coincidental.  But in retrospect, after flipping backwards through my journal, ANY EVENT BEFORE 9-11 is significant.  I have searched for others' reports of UFO activity on 9-10 but have found none, and therefore find it useful to finally let this information out for the universe to chew on. Here is my journal entry:   Monday 10 - Nighttime...walking back from Starbucks, I see a trapazoid shaped object flying through the sky...underneath this object were [many] faint lights...about 600-900ft off ground.   Context: I was an engineering student at the University of Texas at the time and was walking back to my dorm at the time.  I was standing right outside the University Coop on Guadalupe St., looking up above the UT Tower.  I was waiting at the crosswalk and had nothing better to do other than look up, when suddenly, I noticed these lights traveling at great speed.  At first I thought I was seeing birds illuminated by the UT Tower, but then birds don't travel that high, that smoothly, that quickly. The object was flying southbound passing nearly above the UT Tower, traveling towards the Texas Congressional building.  Now I'm no expert, but I would assume that any area above UT/Texas Congress would be restricted, a no-fly zone.  My memory may be hazy here but I would say it traveled about a mile in 5 seconds.  That's roughly 720 mi/hr.  I only say a mile because that's what I would estimate a normal person can see at night looking up.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
slow silent lighted silver triangle pre-dawn northwest Austin going south to north at steady rate of speed;2004-09-06 06:05:00;30 sec;slow silent lighted silver triangle pre-dawn northwest Austin going south to north at steady rate of speed Just after 6 a.m., I went outside to smoke a cigarette.  It was still dark, just the barest beginnings of dawn.  Very quiet.  Northwest Austin, rural area, very little artificial light in this neighborhood.  Saw two soft white lights in the southern sky moving in straight line at steady pace northward.  I assumed it was an airplane but there was no sound, and this is not any kind of usual flight path I've ever observed for commercial flights.  As I watched, I realized it had the appearance of a triangle, which my logical mind doubted, but as I kept watching, there was no doubt.  I had read a bit about black triangles (just enough to know that they had been reported) this was soft silver, giving appearance of rounded edges (not points).  There was no sound at first.  Later, I thought I heard a soft constant roar (like a distant ocean) following it, as it came nearer.  After it had passed, the sound was associated with it, not with something behind it or following it.  Four or five lights became visible as it got closer.  Two were colored, soft red and blue or green, blinking.  The two white lights seen initially were soft and constant.  This thing wasn't hiding.  I observed it constantly for at least 30 seconds.  It never deviated from a straight path.  Its speed did not change.  Its path went directly over my location.  I cannot describe its elevation in feet,  having nothing to compare it with besides commercial airplanes.  I am not into UFO things, but after this I googled silver triangle airplane to see if this particular object had been reported elsewhere . . . or here. . . . and found your website and reports.

Triangle shaped craft hovering over middle school in south austin sped away silently to the west;2004-09-17 03:47:00;5;Triangle shaped craft hovering over middle school in south austin sped away silently to the west For the past two nights, I've noticed some stars above my house that don't belong there.  I'm a wanna-be astronomer - I don't know the names of constellations, but I know what my sky is supposed to look like. That's the only reason I even noticed.  When I focused my binoculars on the ones that didn't belong, it was very difficult to estimate the altitude.  If I were to guess, I'd say it hovered at about 500' - 1000'.  The object was not obviously solid, and appeared nearly the same color as the sky.  As it went overhead it had a more discernable shape, a dim triangle with a light at each point and one light in the center. It appeared slightly darker, but remained a close match to the sky color.  After about 5 minutes of watching, the craft quickly accelerated from it's position directly over Bedichek Middle School at William Cannon and South 1st to what was probably about 500 mph or faster and didn't appear to change altitude - it was observable for another 5 to 6 seconds, and traveled directly over my house in a West (slightly SW) direction.  When it moved, there was absolutely no sound.  It was palpable, though, felt almost like the air became thick and humid, and there was a barely detectable electrical smell in the air.  about 1 minute after the ufo sped away, an aircraft (normal jet from Austin Airport in a normal pattern) passed over;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Triangluar Object very low to the point of seeing detail hanging over the city.;2005-12-28 18:00:00;5 minutes;Triangluar Object very low to the point of seeing detail hanging over the city. driving south on IH 35 from north Austin traffic was very slow as I approched downtown I saw a triangluar object hanging in the sky very low right over the edge of the freeway. Easily seen by all on this part of IH 35. There were no wrecks but very slow traffic. I called my husband on cell phone. When I was past the object and about to turn right onto Slaughter I saw a helicopter moving extremely fast heading North toward the object. Whe I got home I found a phone number of who one should call and got an anwsering machine. I left a message. But was not called back to confirm info. Then called a friend who was visiting her daughter in NC and who had seen one 3/10/1994 also in Austin of the same description and told her about it.  Until I saw it for myself I didn't really believe her.Astonished that it wasn't on the front page of newspaper the next day. Not that I bothered to look.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

When I stepped outside I looked in the sky and noticed a white light in the sky above the trees.  It was in a sort of triangular shape and looked completely out of place.  It resembled a white street light that was not supported by a pole but just suspended in midair.  It did not move in any direction but quickly faded out and was gone in a matter of seconds. I quickly went into the dispatcher's office as the dispatcher was the only other person there that night and told her all about it while I tried to get my thoughts back together.  I later called the nearby airport and asked a guy in the tower if they were sending off weather balloons or if he had gotten a report of something like this.  He said that they weren't sending off weather balloons but he did recieve a report of a similar object 2 weeks prior from someone in a nearby community. My best explanation for the object is that it was an airplane moving away from my direction which gave the illusion that it wasn't moving and that it appeared to fade away when it got far enough.  The airport is close by and I know what airplanes look like flying over at night but this was very different and I haven't seen anything like it since that day.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Green triangle light display over ACL festival in Austin.;2007-09-14 20:15:00;about 10 seconds;Green triangle light display over ACL festival in Austin. I was watching Reverend Horton Heat at the Austin City Limits music festival on this Friday night.  It was at least half way through the show so it must have been about 8:15-8:30.  I can't remember why but for some reason I glanced over toward one of the main stages to the west of where I was.  I saw it about 20 degrees over the horizon and about 30 degrees to the north of the sliver of the moon.  I saw a flashing light and a steady dimmer light.  At first I thought was a helicopter since a police helicopter had flown over the festival several time that night.  If it was a helicopter I would guess it at about 3 or 4 miles away based on the separation and brightness of the lights.  Then it did something that freaked me out.  Suddenly a huge triangular pattern of big bright green lights began flashing very rapidly.  No two lights seemed to flash in sync, it was just wild random flashing of too many lights to count.  The lights were all on the parameter of the triangle pattern with none in the middle.  The weird thing was that if it was a helicopter putting on a light show, then the lighting attachments would have to have been at least the size of a football field or two.  Compared to the distant object I thought I'd seen a second before the triangle light display was enormous.  The light display continued for about 10 seconds as I stared in disbelief trying to figure out what the heck it was.  Just as I started to get the attention of my friend the light show stopped.  I was left explaining to him that the tiny flashing light that he couldn't hardly make out from the other distant aircraft in the sky had just put on a massive light show as if it was right over the festival.  It continued to fade into the distance until I couldn't make it out any more.  I'm ready to accept that this was a human aircraft putting on a lighting display.  The only thing that doesn't make sense to me is the brightness and sure size of the triangular green light display compared to the other lights.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Two far and near objects over Austin, TX. during the early morning of 10/05/2007;2007-10-05 01:05:00;5 minutes (2 Events);Two far and near objects over Austin, TX. during the early morning of 10/05/2007 I just moved to Austin, TX (as of yesterday) and as of right now at 2:39am (10/05/07) I cannot shake this fear I have. I am genuinely scared and would appreciate someone to collaborate or explain what I saw. This new house I am renting doesn't allow smoking indoors so I went outside my window and sat on the roof enjoying the smoke. I saw 2 things just minutes apart which I cannot explain nor forget. It would have been around 1:00 or 1:05AM when I sat up and barely noticed something off in the sky. It looked like CGI or artists drawing of a comet. It had that leading umbrella like front that a comet does, but it had no tail. It looked like it had a wedge shape but you could only make out a front and the back wasn't visible. It moved from right to left from in the sky and was all but invisible against the sky. I only noticed it because it was moving and it seemed very far away and was very faint. As its view crossed across a streetlight it was obscured (washed out by the light). When it came back into view its wedge shape seemed a less of a point and much more rounded in front. It didn't do anything specific and very well could have been a comet, but I doubt it as it would have had to move across the sky line in 1-2 minutes. I took 2 pictures with my cell phone but nether show anything except that light across the street (it was that faint). I was pretty freaked out and called my friend in VA and talked to her about it and while I was on the phone something else happened and now I am scared in my room. I was on the phone with this girl and getting anxious about what I saw and was about to walk through my window when I saw 3 lights VERY CLOSE. If anyone is familiar as to how low the planes fly over Arlington, VA (above the buildings and high rises) when flying into National Airport, it seemed to be about the highest height the planes take before they drop altitude for final approach. That is to say it was so close that I would have heard something. It moved from right to left and was very very close. This defiantly had a triangular isosceles shape (from the 3 lights being in the corner). It was nearly straight above me and moved in a straight line or maybe it had a slight curve to its path. The lights did not illuminate a body of any sort but kept a perfect triangular shape. There was no blinking, NO NOISE and no fucking way I want to see it again. It was fast, but if it was as close as I think it was then it wouldn't have been as fast as the faint/far first object I saw. My friend on the phone was panicing because I was panicing and I woke one of my new roommates but he didn't want anything to do with it. At least he saw the fear I had. If anyone has any idea what it was or can collaborate what was in the sky please please post it. BTW, I have been in Austin less then 24 hours and I am almost willing to pack the car and move back to DC... deposit be damned. I won't be sleeping tonight until my roommates wake up, it isn't as though I'm a coward, far from it. I just can't explain what it is. If I could explain it or understand it or even deny it I'd probably feel a lot better right now. Thanks,;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Triangular or diamond-shaped craft produced rhythmic circular humming as it slowly flew by very low in the sky.;2008-03-19 23:30:00;5 min;Triangular or diamond-shaped craft produced rhythmic circular humming as it slowly flew by very low in the sky. Last night on March 19, 2008, I was coming home from the grocery store and was about to turn onto my street, when I observed a really bright light up in the sky above what used to be a field next to my neighborhood. Now, there is new construction going on every day and I wasn’t sure if the bright light was atop a new cell phone or radio tower that may have been built next door or if it was a search light on a helicopter. At first, I couldn’t tell whether the light was stationary or moving very slowly so those were the two possibilities that immediately came to mind. I parked the car in front of my house and was about to unload groceries when I noticed the bright light was gone. Instead, an object was moving very slowly and steadily from the north, where I originally saw the bright light, to the south and it passed directly overhead, quite low in the sky. If I had to guess, I would say it was perhaps 20 stories from the ground. I couldn’t tell whether it was triangular or diamond-shaped, but it was one of those, judging by the half a dozen or so red and blue blinking lights on the underside of the craft. I can’t stress enough how slowly and how low in the sky it was much lower than a plane would fly. The other unusual thing I noticed was the sound it made. It was a humming sound that repeated in a circular fashion. It was definitely made by a machine, but it didn’t clank metallically, and it wasn’t high-pitched. It’s difficult to describe, but it was certainly rhythmic and repetitive. I am not sure how big it was because I couldn’t see the entire outline of the craft, but it was much larger than a helicopter and probably smaller than or about the size of a football field. I wasn’t afraid as I watched the object make its way slowly southward. Instead I was curious, trying to figure out what I was looking at. Unfortunately, my camera was in my upstairs bedroom and my camera phone is virtually worthless at night. It wasn’t long before I lost sight of the object and went into the house with my groceries. The time was exactly 11:30 pm when I walked in the front door. I estimate that the entire sighting took about five minutes. I awakened my housemate and told him what I’d witnessed, and then called my sister to tell her, too. I mentioned it to my boyfriend the following morning and he said that there are now planes that can hover, but that they would have no business doing that above a residential area. All I know is that it didn’t look or sound like any kind of plane I’ve ever seen or heard. One second it was there and the next, it was gone. The night was cold and clear. There was a full moon with little or no breeze in far south Austin, Texas. I was completely sober and have no history of mental illness or attention-seeking. The date of this report is March 20, 2008. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Slow moving, solid trinagle (no wings) with green and red lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Green/red is not inconsistent with an aircraft.

I was traveling West on the 2222 and had just crossed over the 360 when I spotted the aircraft. The aircraft was at first was in the distance, flying very close to the hills, and I noticed it was an abnormal size and had strange lights for an airplane, it was also moving extremely slow.  As I continued on the 2222 the aircraft flew closer to the 2222 and I realized it was flying extremely low and the slow speed became more apparent.  It passed over my car and I observed it was a solid triangular shape with brilliant green and red lights along the outside of the triangle.  I cannot recall the exact pattern of the lights. What struck me the most odd, and why I am reporting this, is the triangle shape. It was a solid triangle, with no visible wings. I am guessing this might be some sort of military plane but I have never seen anything like it. My background is that I am a 38-year-old professional Caucasian female who never believed they would be filling this kind of thing out.

Slow, lightless Boomerang object in AustinTx;2012-09-08 23:05:00;10 seconds;Slow, lightless Boomerang object in AustinTx I was at work taking out the garbage, it was very dark other than a sliver of the moon and some street lights. I noticed a subtle flash above, as if lighting flashed while covered in thick overcast before a storm. I looked up to see no storm or much clouds, but instead quickly noticed a boomerang shaped object cruising around 40mph with no lights on. I could make out circles on its underside in a symmetrical pattern. I knew from that moment I was seeing my first UFO.  It should also be taken into consideration that being in Austin I live within 30 miles of a military base. You can look it up if you want the name of it. I am 20 years old and I have perfect 20/20 vision. I'm more inclined to think a government aircraft though I can't be certain.

UFO lights over Austin, Texas ACL Fest During the Cure Concert.;2013-10-12 20:55:00;1 minute;UFO lights over Austin, Texas ACL Fest During the Cure Concert I observed 3 points of light suddenly appearing in the night sky above the stage of The Cure concert at ACL Music Fest on October 12, 2013, at approximately 8:55.  I looked around to see if anyone else had noticed and leaned over to point it out to a stranger. We both had no explanation.  The lights were in a D triangular formation, probably 15 degrees in distance - the first light to the next - and were moving inward together at more than just a slow gradual pace.  They were orange in color and glowing.  My first thought to attempt to explain it away was that maybe someone had suddenly let 3 balloons aloft with candles or lights in the area, but they stayed in perfect synchronization without any change in proportional shape, aside from shrinking closer together in a matter of seconds.  The formation, or triangle, then receded into the fog and/or clouds.  The position in the sky was approximately 45 degrees. One person from the audience had been aiming a green laser upward to point the sighting out. Two friends of mine elsewhere in the crowd also witnessed the event, as did most likely hundreds as the group was a popular closing act and the surrounding was area packed. One witnessed appears to have captured video and reported the incident with MUFON (case #51502).;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Low to the ground triangular aircraft coming from west Texas;2014-01-04 00:38:00;7 seconds;Low to the ground triangular aircraft coming from west Texas At approximately 12:38am, me and my boyfriend, while walking up to his front door, heard a loud noise like a nuclear warhead missile was heading right towards us from Southwestern Texas.  The noise started off low and increased in volume until we heard a loud boom!  It was so out of the ordinary that me and him expected to see light from an explosion and ducked down, ready to run the opposite way.  Instead, it got quieter, but the noise still continued.  We realized it was coming towards us and ran out to an opening in some nearby trees.  The sky was filled with low clouds and visibility was poor, but we were able to make out a trianglar shaped craft that was low to the ground, and made very little noise as it passed.  Yellow light was on both ends of the wings and in the center middle, like a circle.  The craft was dark gray or black.  We were only able to catch a glimpse and it was gone soon after. It's not common to hear aircrafts flying by so low and so quiet, and to fly directly over his house.  We have never seen anything like it again.  We know there is an air force base in San Antonio, but it was unlike any other plane we have seen so far.  All other planes that we have spotted in the sky at that time of night are very high up, loud, and have only red and blue lights.  This craft was much closer.

Massive triangle shaped craft flew directly over me with out a sound.;2014-09-01 21:00:00;10 minutes;massive triangle shaped craft flew directly over me with out a sound. It was in late September early October when I witnessed this event. Me and a friend where sitting outside when I seen what appears to be 2 single lights.  The lights where off in the distance but the way they were moving immediately struck me as odd..they were positioned cade corner from eachother .by the way they were moving in a way that caught my eye..I asked my friend what he thought they were and we watched the lights for about 5 minutes..we both threw out suggestions of what we thought it was..my best description was that it moved like a helicopter. After watching for a few minutes and calling my brother to come look at what we were looking at the 2 lights that appeared close to eachother a moved one left one right in a blink of an eye to either side of the sky.. My brother was spooked and went inside in a hurry.me and my friend stayed outside ..The lights were now accross the sky from eachother..The one that moved to the left appeared to be coming in our direction.the one that went to the right was farther from us and our attention was on the one nearest... We watched this single white light come closer at a very low speed.i couldn't see any shape at this point but from the way it moved and how low it was flying I knee something was very odd. Keep in mind.i do live by an airport and see planes all the ttime and never seen one move this wsy..The movement was more of a hover.the speed was very slow. we could tell it was coming towards the area we were at.i don't know the exact distance it was from us but it was getting closer and closer and we still didn't hear any noise coming from the object. My friend was then spooked and tries to run inside .I grabbed his arm and asked him to wait with me .We stood there another minute and it was getting closer to the point where I agreed and we both ran inside. As soon as I get inside my curiosity just starts eating at me and I ran back outside .I look towards where I last seen the object.nothing there.i look straight up in the sky and it was directly above me. It was a triangle shaped aircraft.i didn't see the white light anymore but red lights that lined the front in a v shape.the rest of the craft was pitch black. My parents property is is a little over an acre and this craft looked every bit larger ..it seemed to be so low I could throw a rock at it.it was completely silent and moving at a low speed.i was in shock or awe from what I had seen. One thing that I still don't understand is why I didn't see it fly away.i forget if I ran back inside or what I did.my mind was running a thousand mph it seemed. I just remember looking back up at it and didn't see it any more.there was no noise or vibration for me to look in its directiom.it was just gone. I started talking to the neighbors right after this took place when 2 jets with huge spotlights .I mean lights that lit up the land huge ,started flying in a big circle around this area. Never has anyone heard jets that loud fly so low or jets with massive spotlights on them around here. This was definitely an odd occurance.i mean those jets were odd due to the fact that no one has seen those either but the triangle shaped craft that flew directly over my mom's house without a sound was scary odd.it was like watching a paper airplane in the air.not a noise.

HUGE Triangle Craft hovering near I-35 North Austin;2014-09-06 21:45:00;?;HUGE Triangle Craft hovering near I-35 North Austin My fiance and I were driving northbound on Interstate 35 at approximately 9:45 pm, leaving downtown Austin. While approaching the Hwy 183 exit we both saw an extremely bright light that appeared to be moving South/slightly West (towards us). There was a dim blue light and red light appearing to be flashing on either side of the bright white light. As we approached the object we could see it was a HUGE triangular craft (approximately the size of a football field?) with a very intense white spotlight in the front and two white lights on either back corner. The red/blue lights appeared to be on the bottom of the craft. The object was hovering about 300-400 yards above the ground and did not appear to be moving by the time we passed it. It was very near to the Interstate. Either we crossed out of view suddenly, or the craft simply vanished in to thin air, as we were not able to see it (despite it's enormous size) about a minute and a half after passing it. We were driving about 65-70mph.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

12 Silent Craft Over South Travis Co., TX;2017-03-18 20:59:00;3 minutes;12 Silent Craft Over South Travis Co., TX My neighbor called me at 20:59 to say there were a number of craft flying overhead, making no sound.  I rushed outside to the front of my house, and only witnessed two of the craft.  For less than 30 seconds, I saw one each of a set of red, blue, and green blinking lights on each craft arranged in a triangle shape.  They were flying to the east of my house on a North or NW path.  I did not hear any engine sounds.  They may have been about three miles away and 1000 feet or higher. I ran back inside my house and told my wife about the craft, and we ran into the backyard in time to see the two crafts pass further to the north in about twenty seconds, when they passed out of sight into the light cloud covering.  My wife only witnessed the two craft  from the back just before they disappeared.  She could only discern the red lights.  She did not hear any engine sounds either, but she said if they were normal, identifiable craft, she might not have heard any sounds anyway from that distance.. I spoke to my neighbor again and that is when he confirmed that he and his wife had estimated about a dozen ships flying to the east of his house.  His house is about one block from our house.  The craft never flew directly over our houses but may have moved near our area as if they came from the airport to the east of us.  The direction they were headed after we last saw them, if they stayed on that path, would have taken them directly over the city. We did not get to take any video or images. Just as the crafts dissapeared from sight, some type of passenger sized plane flew directly over our house from east to west.  It appeared about 2000 feet higher than the other craft.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Objects were quite far though. Aerodynamics were way to fast to be anything I've ever seen in the sky.  Movements to the left and right, up and down very rapidly made me know it wasn't just a plane.  Another one to two objects appears and they all seemed to look they they were dancing diamonds in the sky.  Tried to record, however, when I tried, the objects would disappear.   Went back into the house to get a family member to witness as well.  Objects started right back up five minutes later then then vanished into space three minutes later.   Glad to know I'm not crazy.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Triangular object flying over south Austin and I have it on my car camera;2018-01-20 21:20:00;<1 minute;Triangular object flying over south Austin and I have it on my car camera On January 20, 2018, I was driving westbound on Slaughter lane west of Interstate 35 on my way home from visiting a friend.  I noticed something out of the corner of my left eye and looked at the time.  It was approximately 9:20 p.m. It was dark out and I was having a hard time trying to understand what I saw.  There was a triangular object in the sky moving north northeast.  It had lights and that is what caught my attention.  It moved at a decent pace and I lost sight of it when it went over a shopping center. I have a video of the object and have uploaded onto my YouTube account.  I also reported it to Mufon.  Their case manager told me there was another sighting the same evening with video northeast and a little later of my video.  They said the second video was quite impressive and had more detail of the object.  I've never seen the report or the other video.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Faint translucent triangle covered in tiny lights.;2018-04-26 22:30:00;3 minutes;Faint translucent triangle covered in tiny lights. Went outside to drop the trash in the dumpster, when a strange, translucent triangle thing flew over my head.  It was moving in a straight line from South to North and disappeared from view on the horizon.  Completely silent, and it wasn't glowing brightly at all.  More like a subtle glow emitted from a hundred little lights covering the surface.  It looked as though you could see the night sky in between the small lights.  Almost like a faint constellation floating across the sky.   There were airplanes in the sky going from West to East towards the airport.  The UFO looked like it was at a lower altitude than the planes.  I would guess that it was maybe 20 feet across, but hard to tell since I don't know how far away it was.  Even though it was moving in a steady straight line, it seemed almost organic (but I can't figure out why it 'felt' that way.  The only rational explanation I can come up with is a B2 bomber flying with no lights and the engines silent.  But why would it be flying over the city?  And I would assume it would look more opaque if that were the case.  I'm very skeptical when I read about other UFO sightings, so this experience really took me by surprise.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
2 Transparent Triangle shaped objects observed in Austin, TX.;2019-01-20 23:17:00;5-7 seconds;2 Transparent Triangle shaped objects observed in Austin, TX. I was observing the blood moon eclipse last night, it was cold so after about 20 minutes or so I decided to go inside.  I was walking back up to my house and saw a shooting star break over my house and continue to the northeast, as it got just above my house the “shooting star” dimmed and I could clearly see the outline of 2 triangle shaped objects flying right next to one another, almost like they were connected.  The outline of the objects was dark against the sky but the object itself was transparent, they flew silently for about the next 5 seconds and then I lost sight of them.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

I caught something in the corner of my eye and was able to identify a triangular object moving across the sky.  The moon was bright as well as the stars and I saw a triangle with lights on it gliding across the sky.  It was very faint and almost blended in with the sky, but I have excellent vision and could comprehend what I saw.  A triangle shape that had lights along the sides of it. It was moving fast, faint light, and was definitely something out of the ordinary.  I live by a large airport and there are multiple military and airports within the area.  Thank you for collecting this information, as I saw multiple reports of the same thing on this site with Austin, Texas, and it validates what I saw.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Brown boomerang shape glided across the sky with no light or sound.;2019-04-27 19:25:00;15 minutes;Brown boomerang shape glided across the sky with no light or sound. I saw a giant brown boomarang shape in the sky.  No lights, no sound, it just glided across the sky slowly.  It moved like a low cloud across the sky.   A few minutes later I was looking across the pool in the direction where the ufo had gone, and there were two orbs of light.   I kept looking until the lights started bouncing, and all the sudden, the ship blasted into space like in the movies.  It left tracers of rainbow neon light behind it.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
