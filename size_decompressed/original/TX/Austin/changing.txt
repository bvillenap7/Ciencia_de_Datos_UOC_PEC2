We  acknowledged the lights for only a second at first, until they got so bright we pulled over. It was one'o clock in the morning but the lights were so bright we could see all around us like it way day. When we pulled over another car parked and watched with us. Then our car radio began making this noise, not at all like static, but a banging frequency sound is the only way to describe it. There were about four to six of them, hovering the sky above us. They were vey small but were very bright. They were red at when still but a whiteish-blue when moving. They had no particular shape to them, round when still and flat when moving. They whistled when they moved, a very high pitched sound. They were so close at one time we had to cover our ears because of the sound. They were flying in all angles, speeding and stopping freely. They had no particular formation but they stayed in a close group. Lights shot out from them that looked like it was behind them but wasnt. They stayed directly above us, and it was strange because we were the only part  of the area that was lit up. This lasted for about half an hour then they shot across the sky and vanished.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Daytime observation of metallic object in Austin, Tx.;2002-08-28 15:30:00;5minutes;Daytime observation of metallic object in Austin, Tx. Let me start by saying that I am a police officer in Austin Tx.  On 08-28-02 at approximately 3:30pm myself and a friend were at the swimming pool at an apartment complex located at brodie lane and west william cannon drive(austin tx).  The sky was very clear with a few clouds in the distance.  My female friend stated, whats that and pointed to the northwest.  I looked up and observed a shiny metallic object hovering in the sky.  The object was shaped like a 3 pointed star (like the mitsubishi symbol).  She asked me if I thought it was balloons.  The object then changed formation slowly and began moving towards us.  It is difficult to estimate the altitude of the object when we first observed it, but it would cover about 1 in size held at my arms length.  The object then came very close over the pool area (almost directly over) where we were.  It had changed shape and was now like a vertical cylindrical object with blurred features.  The altitude had dropped to perhaps 100'.  I knew that something was way out of the ordinary when I observed a metallic object projecting from the right side of the craft (?).  The sun was reflecting on the projecting object and I know without a doubt that it was solid and definately not a balloon.  It appeared to be almost chrome colored.  It also appeared to me that the object was traveling against the wind (moving from northeast to southwest).  We were, up to this point, the only two people at the pool.  Just as the craft was over the pool area 4 teenagers approched (3 males 1 female).  I asked them, do you see that...what do you think it is?.  They all watched the object with us for a few minutes and did not reply.  The object hovered over the pool area for 1-2 minutes and then began moving towards the southwest again.  As it did it changed shape again and started gaining altitude.  I lost sight of the object as the roof of the clubhouse blocked my view.  Let me state that I could hear the noise from the traffic on the roadways, and air traffic in the distance (a ! southwes t airlines plane flew by from east to west) - but at no time did I hear any noise from the object. Based on the slow speed and low altitude of the object I feel confident that many other observations were made in this area. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this police officer and found him to be quite credible and convincing.  PD));30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
2 blue-lit conicle objects rotate around each other and then morph into 1 object and disappear.;2003-12-19 02:30:00;45 seconds;2 blue-lit conicle objects rotate around each other and then morph into 1 object and disappear. While I was out at my car on break from night shift I happened to look at the incredible stars. As I looked up I saw 2 objects that looked like conicle, blue-lit, smooth objects. The objects rotated around each other several times. I called over to several co-workers that were nearby. They also looked up and saw the objects. As we all stood there the objects seemed to morph into a single object. About 10 seconds later they disappeared completely from sight. None of the 4 of us could even fathom what the objects/object might have been.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

fire and triangles in the sky over austin texas may 24 and 25 2005;2005-05-24 22:30:00;90 seconds;fire and triangles in the sky over austin texas may 24 and 25 2005 While on the phone outside I looked north to see a triangular shape with three different colored lights. I recognized red, blue, and green.  I went to grab my friend, when we returned there was a bright firey light adjacent to the object. The light was shaped like a torn seem, the light was seemingly almost as bright as the sun. The light was a mix of white and orange.  A jet from the local airforce bace approached from the west traveling east directly for the triangular object and adjacent light.  We knew it was a jet because of airfoce experience, it was unmistakeable.  As the jet approached the source the seem of light moved inward and closed as if it pixilated from mass to miniscule. The Triangular shape turned in a direction that faced upward and north by northwest.  At this point we no longer saw three colors of light.  We saw three red circles instead and they grew rapidly smaller with the Triangles departure.  As it moved north by northwest it broke due east and appeared to be a weather helicopter or civilian chopper of some sort.  Another event in seemingly the same location happened tonight, coincidentally while I was on the phone outside.  This time the triangular shape was difficult to see.  The adjacent light was much brighter and appeared to move south towards my self.  As this happened the Triangular shape became more and more difficult to see.  Then impossible to see.  The light moved inward and closed what seemed to be a tear or gap or seem.  There was no triangular object after the light closed. Airforce jets responded this time as well from the same direction. They didnt get nearly as close before the firey light as ceased.  If anyone knows anything about these events please share them on this site, I will check back periodically.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Changing shape UFO over Florence, TX;2012-04-15 02:00:00;5 minutes;Changing shape UFO over Florence,tx My husband and I were coming home from Austin around 2 Sunday morning and we saw a UFO just before florence.  We saw three bright lights. At first i thought it was a helicopter because it had a huge spotlight type light on the front.  There were no flashing lights like planes, blimps, or helicopters have. It was flying really low so we stopped to see if we could hear anything but there was no sound coming from it. It hovered for a little while and started headed away from us towards Austin.  The object changed from three lights to four like a square.  As it got further away and faster it changed to a triangle shape. I'm not sure what it was, but it wasn't anything I have ever seen before.Â  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Spheres of light seen over the west campus area of austin which then broke apart and sped off in different directions.;2012-10-10 21:00:00;15-20 minutes;Spheres of light seen over the west campus area of austin which then broke apart and sped off in different directions. A large object appeared in the sky over the west campus area that looked very much like a plane but stayed in the same spot for over 10 minutes and did not make a sound.  It appeared to consist of 5-6 spheres of light.  First thought was that it was a spotlight but the glow was shining through the clouds from above.  After some time spheres broke apart and sped off in different directions.  Upon looking for other accounts, a posting was found online describing the exact same event, down to the time, physical description, and the breaking up of the spheres.  After posting a reply, a third party contacted me saying he saw the same event.  My friend took a picture and video, both of which I will post.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
White blimp-like object, glows pink at times and changes shape;2013-03-17 17:00:00;5 minutes;White blimp-like object, glows pink at times and changes shape Myself and another witness observed what we initially thought was a white blimp.  Its bright white football shape quickly morphed into, what I can best describe as, a series of cotton balls attached to one another. It then began to writhe much like an amorphous earthworm. At the end of the object there was a small appendage that seemed to dangle separately, but it (the appendage) did not change shape. There was a &quotfuzz&quot surrounding the entire object that seemed to not allow proper focus (i.e. very few sharp edges or contrast). When it was at its closest, I thought I detected a pink hazy light, much like bio luminescence. And after a quick grab of my binoculars, the pink was obvious. Even after it had moved further away, I could see the pink light. It looked as though it was inside the object, and slightly outside the dorsal portion of it. It was silently moving from east to west, with surface winds approximately blowing at 5mph from the SSE. But at several points during the observation, it was moving into the wind. It seemed to be a controlled &quotflight&quot and not wind driven. Its height was below the low clouds that were drifting lazily by. What ever the cloud deck height was in Austin that day will give its approximate height. At one point there was a twin-engined small plane moving parallel to the object's position. As the plane moved closer, the object moved further away. Eventually the object simply disappeared. I observed the object for at least 5-minutes, but the first witness only saw it for a minute or so. I attempted to film it, but it doesn't show up on my camera. I did find a video of another observation that looks almost identical to what I saw.

I have five degrees from such schools as NYU, St. Mary's U San Antonio, Excelsior Colleges Albany, College of Santa Fe, with graduate work at USC, Boston University, Tulane, Xavier University New Orleans,! Loyola New Orleans and over a dozen other graduate schools. I have been an avid aviation enthusiast since childhood, was a CAP Cadet at Lackland, Randolph, and Barksdale Air Bases, and was a close friend of Col. Jeff DeBlanc, USMC WWII Ace with Medal of Honor and Adrian Conrad, engineer who help design and build the Army Jumps reconnaissance drones introduced in Desert Storm.  Both friends related UFO they saw. Jeff was warned never to mention his WWII encounter with a UFO. Today I was on my 2nd floor balcony observing the very display of numerous stars over Austin, where city glare and haze limit observable stars to a dozen or so every night. This morning at 5 AM I was viewing the eastern sky with large 10 power binoculars when a star of the second magnitude (brightness) appeared to be blinking with reds and blues in addition to its white light.  It was at 100 degrees East, elevation about 45 degrees, and with the binoculars it was like the thing I reported to your site about a week ago.  I took some clumsy videos that time, but was afraid I had taken photos of lights in the parking lot below my balcony, and because there were only short views of the supposed UFO lasting only moments during a long blank video, I did not edit or forward the videos. This morning, however, I made nine videos, and was able to zoom in with my 15 power optical lens and capture many seconds of continuous video images of the UFO blinking red, green, brown, orange, white, blue, and mixed colors.  I was forced to hold the camera in my hands, so the UFO seems to be jumping and zooming around, but that's due to my jiggling hands. What it did do was appear as if it were a blinking white star, but suddenly it would become an round image, as if it were holding up a red, brown, green or orange shield in front of itself.  The apparent disk shielding the UFO was solid color, or occasionally a dull color rimmed with red or orange.  It rapidly changed appearance, with the shield image seemingly closer and larger than the hidden image that seemed to be behind it. I will post all today's videos as Google files as soon as I figure out how to do that.  Maybe you can recommend someone who could coach me.  The files are on my SD drive with copies on my hard drive. My camera is now mounted on a tripod supported my a lightweight table on my balcony, and it the sky clears, I will try looking in the same place in the sky as I did last night, 100 deg East, about 45 deg elevation.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
