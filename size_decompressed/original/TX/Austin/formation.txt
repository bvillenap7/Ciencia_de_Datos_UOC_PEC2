circular light pattern that flew off with great speed in formation with 2 Air Force Jets on its tail.;1981-08-01 03:00:00;7 minutes;circular light pattern that flew off with great speed in formation with 2 Air Force Jets on its tail. It was the summer of 1981. I was on an overnight stay at Lake Travis just outside of Austin, Texas, with 3 other friends. I couldn't sleep for gazing at all the stars. They were beautiful as always. Sometime after midnight, I spotted lights flashing in a circular motion of red and green. They appeared to be about the distance of todays satellite's, in the sky just overhead of me. This was a popular campsite and probably 20 - 30 people were scattered over the entire campsite. I was camping on the East side of Lake Travis. I became fixed on the site immediately. After 1-2 minutes, they completed another circle and shot off out in to space in a straight line formation. As if to follow one another. The speed was incredible. So fast I lost them quickly as they left a short streak of light behind them as they disappeared in the night, some 30-45 seconds more. I woke my 3 friends with a start! Trying quietly and calmly to explain what I'd seen. This took another 2-2.1/2 minutes. Suddenly, 2 Air Force Jets came flying very low and very fast over the campsite and woke up everyone there. They were extremely loud! We all held our ears for they were low. They flew up and towards the direction of the lights I had just seen going S-SW of the Lake. Everyone there witnessed the Jets. I had no interest in UFO's at the time, but I felt I had seen what the Jets were after. It was only years later when television began showing a number of shows about UFO's that I became curious about what I saw that night back in the summer of 81'. Most sightings are near Air Force Bases or so I've heard. Also, that military air vehicles are present at the time of other sightings. My best friend of 13 years at the time, (now 27 years) knew I wasn't joking about what I'd seen, however, my other two friends weren't sure. Everyone knew about the Jets, though. I've been looking up ever since. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Three dome shaped lights. One craft or three I don't know.;1999-11-20 21:50:00;<10 sec;Three dome shaped lights. One craft or three I don't know. This is an addendum to a report I made approx 16 hours ago concerning a craft of unknown identity spotted in Austin TX. Craft Size: It was between a quarter and half-dollar held at arm's length. Of course that is an estimation and I cannot give it any weight. I can say that the circle / lights were distanced 1 1/2 circle / light  diameters apart and if linked would from an equilatoral triangle. An imaginary cicle periphery drawn around the three lights would be 2.5 times the size of each light. The craft proceeded north triangle point leading. The lights had depth to them and appeared as shallow domes of light. The effect was something like viewing a tent with a lightsource inside. You don't see the source but its interaction with the tent material. So too were these lights. They appeared to softly luminesce these shallow domes in a very off orange color. As I mentioned somewhere between subdued peach and burnt ocher. During and immediately after the incident I recorded other visible activity in the sky and this consisted of three other, conventional, aircraft. None interacted with the object and appeared to be normal air traffic. The closest was at least 3-5 kilometers away and the farthest between 8 and 12. Two were generally northeast and one (the farthest) was west. Austin-Bergstrom international airport lies east southeast approx 5 miles away. I hope this comletes this report accurately for you. If I can clarify anything further please let me know. A copy of my initial report is enclosed below. My wife and I were returning to work after a lunch break. I stepped outside and looked up to see the moon. Instead what I saw were three dome shaped lights that were moving north at a constant rate of travel. All three lights were the same color something between a subdued peach & burnt ocher. They did not blink or flash. The lights were either three individual craft moving in perfect triangular formation, or they were attached to one indistinguishable craft. All moved exactly in unison! The craft covered about 40 degrees of sky in less than ten seconds and maintained a constant velocity. No noise accompanied this sighting. I shouted over and over at my wife to Look at this! Look at this! She was closing the door behind me and turned and observed the craft for about seven seconds. After continuing across the sky in a straight line the UFO disappeared seemingly winking to nothing as it went into the night. My wife was extrememly shaken. I too felt this, but I also felt excitement. Disbelief. Never have I seen anything even close. I am an Army veteran and am trained in aircraft identification. This was absolutely not a conventional powered aircraft. Nor is it anything I have ever been instructed to watch for. Very chillingly this craft is a near identicle copy of a recreation I observed very recently on TV of a UFO reported all over Britain in one night and investigated by that fromer MOD official whose name I cannot recall. I believe the show was Sightings. The event is less that 2 hours old and I am back at work, but my mind is not focused and I feel as though I am running on Auto. What do I do now?;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Amber glow with two star-like points of light all moving in a triangular formation;2007-02-07 20:45:00;2 minutes;Amber glow with two star-like points of light all moving in a triangular formation At 8:47 pm on 2-7-07 while waiting for the UT shuttle, I witnessed an Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon for about two minutes.  I first spotted a very faint amber object about 150 feet in the night sky above Waller Creek running alongside San Jacinto St in front of the UT Art Building.  At first I thought it was a balloon or parachute floating, but as I observed it more intently, it was more of a dim, amber/golden glow, roughly trapezoidal, but it was more amorphous and had no hard edges.  I had dark shades running through it, as if something were inside it, or possibly surrounding the glow--it was hard to tell.  I tracked it visually as it flew silently, north over Waller Creek at a steady, slow pace maintaining the same altitude.  I then noticed that below the amber object were two very dim points of light similar to stars that were moving with it.  The points of light were at odd angles from the amber glow and their distance from each other formed an uneven triangle.  All three lights moved together and stayed in the same triangular formation.  My eyes were transfixed as I tried to determine what it could have been.  Being an artist with excellent observational skills, I flipped through every possible explanation in my head: It didn’t even remotely resemble a plane. The moon and stars don’t fly along. The objects were not solid like a balloon, parachute, weather balloon, or any other aircraft.  Also, the amorphous quality of the amber glow and the dimness of the two moving star-like objects just didn’t make sense to me, compared with regular airplanes I’ve seen hundreds of times before.  Something was just not right about this thing.  I thought about running to keep up with it, but I was exhausted from having just run 4 miles at the track, and I think it was traveling too fast to follow on foot, though a car could have kept up with it easily.  As the objects moved farther away, my bus showed up and I had to leave.  When I got on the bus and looked around at people, I had a heightened sense of awareness of my surroundings, particularly my visual and olfactory senses--lights were much more intense than usual and I was acutely aware of everyone’s movements and of the faintest smells around me.  For the rest of the night I couldn’t stop thinking about the UAP.  I kept thinking about what normal object would match what I had seen earlier, but there were none.  I know what I saw and it was anything but normal.  I’m very reluctant to mention this to anyone, but I thought it important to at least report what I witnessed.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Saw a string of about 10 to 12 lights in a loose V-formation very high up moving quickly across the sky in Austin, TX.;2010-10-29 04:05:00;15 seconds;Saw a string of about 10 to 12 lights in a loose V-formation very high up moving quickly across the sky in Austin, TX. At about 4:05 a.m. on October 29, 2010 in Austin, TX I took my dog outside to the backyard and looked up at the stars.  I noticed a string of about 10 to 12 lights in a loose V-formation very high up moving quickly across the sky.  A tree blocked my vision for a moment and it was gone.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Flotilla over Austin, disguised as Orion.;2017-01-06 17:30:00;5 minutes;Flotilla over Austin disguised as Orion. I am trying to get other people on FB or otherwise to say they if saw it... I posted to FB 30 seconds after my witness, trying to get another witness. I was just casually outside having a smoke.  I am an artist, and generally interested in the clouds, the stars, what the sky looks like.  I wasn't paying any special attention. I saw the constelletion Orion, and thought, that's odd I don't think this rises for hours?  The sun was up, so not that visable. It started moving north across the sky way way way too fast to be stars. I was in Austin corner of 51/Airport this formation headed north.  They looked like evening stars, except evening stars don't move even close to that fast. I sometimes have vision problems, so I kept taking my glasses on off, on off, on off.  NO I saw the same thing either way. Last I checked, Orion doesn't change ten degrees in 30 seconds.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Four solid orange lights seen flying in formation, before they disappeared.;2018-08-07 21:08:00;2 minutes;Four solid orange lights seen flying in formation, before they disappeared Triangular formation of three solid orange lights appeared in the southeast sky on a cloudless evening.  After observing for 30 seconds, we noticed a fourth orange light trailing the three that made the triangle.  The three that made the triangle looked like they turned and we thought it was coming out way and were hoping they would pass overhead, but then they all faded.  The fourth trailing light remained visible for maybe 15 seconds after the first three were gone.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Some were very close to one another and some were further.  If the line moved at all, every light moved at the same turning point.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
