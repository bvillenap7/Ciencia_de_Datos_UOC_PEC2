A thin, perfect circle of silver light appeared northeast of my position.  As I observed the circle, it began to fill in with a faint golden light.  The light filled in the circle with irregular rivulets of golden light until the circle glowed a uniform golden color, not unlike that of a full moon except that it was perfectly uniform with no craters or surface imperfections.  It was about the size of a nickle held at arm's length and about 30-35 degrees off the horizon.  I had a clear view with no obstructions.  The circle of golden light was well defined at first.  It then began to slowly increase in brightness until it appeared to boil with the boundaries becoming indistinct.  It then began to move in an arc toward the North maintaining a uniform elevation above the horizon.  I then began to notice that it was decreasing in brightness slowly as it moved.  It lost brightness uniformly until it was once again a distinct circle of light.  It continued to slowly move toward the North until it was no longer visible.  It moved a total of approximately 40 degrees of arc in 10 minutes or so.  No sound was apparent. (NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Played with by a UFO;1973-06-01 21:00:00;10-15 MINUTES;Played with by a UFO Returning from an night practice low level photo training mission in a RF4C as we were nearing Austin, Texas, at as I remember around 15,000ft, I noticed in the distance a light that would instantaneously and abnormally change positions ahead and below me.   I asked my Weapons Systems operator behind me if he happened to notice that and he responded very positively that he did.   It was a clear and beautiful evening with no clouds and a bright moon.  I told my back seater that I would maneuver to try to intercept what ever it was doing that.  It wasn't long before what ever it was was seemed to be playing games with me for it would be here and there and when I would go towards where ever I thought it would be, it would be gone.  We continued this for maybe a few minutes and by this time were somewhere Northwest of Austin and somewhere around 10,000 to 15,000 for our directions and altitudes kept changing due to this light in the sky I was trying to catch up with.   Suddenly in the distance before me the light made a tracking 180 degree turn and was obviously returning directly headon into us.  I made a comment to my back seater Damn ___ I think we've pissed it off.  I pushed the stick rapidly forward to avoid what I thought surely was going to be a midair collision. The instant I knew we had avoided the collision, I immediately went into afterburning to initiate a high g turn for that really angered me.   It may have just been my imagination, but as whatever it was we had just missed seem to give our aircraft a compression push downward.  That may have been from my own action of abruptly pushing the stick forward and then going into afterburner.   To continue, craning my head back during the high g turn, there is no doubt to me I saw an eerie blue glow quickly fading away from me.  For a brief a moment I thought the thing was gone and my back seater and I began a rather spirited conversation about the preceeding events.  I made calls to other aircraft in flight as well as both control towers in the area, BUT none had seen anything unusual.  Had almost called it a night when we both saw what looked like a firey crash just off of Robert Mueller airport.   I immediately called the control tower, but they said that all was normal and they saw nothing.  We circled just north of the airport for we both confirmed with each other what we had seen.  Suddenly, from off the airport the way it went in, we saw a spectacular show of something shooting into the sky to the north.  I again called the control tower but they saw nothing.   I pushed the throttle forward and flew in the direction of the thing we saw leaving the ground.   Suddenly before us and about over the city of Georgetown, the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life happened.  This thing we were pursuing stopped in mid air and lit up like with flashing lights and what looked like a classically described UFO, Oval in shape with portals and flashing and beaming lights coming from it.   My backseater and I confirmed together all we were seeing.  I told my back seater, as I remember, --- this is too much. We need to bring this thing down -- it is too important to let it escape.  I am going to try to give it a glancing blow and think we will be ok, but be ready to eject if you have to.   I again went into afterburner and aimed for that UFO.  It suddenly went completely dark and the next thing we knew, we watched as it left an almost vertical path upward and we knew at the speed it was going, there was nothing we could do about it.  Within a few seconds it was gone and mixed in with the heavenly stars above.  Our fuel by this time demanded we land.   We did not make a report.  What was there to report that just the 2 of us experiencedd???   YES, we are being monitored and examined by a superior existence somewhere in this Universe.

A friend and I were in central Austin, just at dusk,headed weston the feeder of a  major highway. We looked up, saw this fireball appear about 30 degrees above the horizon, a greenish fireball with a hot white cen- ter. it had a tail of sparkling white stuff trailing behind it. It zoomed silently for about 10 seconds, more or less level with the hori- zon, then just winked out. I have seen these several times, as had my friend.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

It was a;2002-04-10 16:35:00;5minutes;I was headed for work and was dropping off my trash at the Trash dumpster and looked up and saw a Silver Sphere just hovering. It was a clear blue sky with a few white clouds passing by it. It never moved just hung there motionless. At first I thought it was a Balloon but it never drifted with the wind. The clouds were moving by it but it never changed position. I watched it for about 5 minutes curious at what it was and even looked for someone else around to show it too but of course no one was there. What struck me as being unusual is it was a Breezy day but it had no effect on it moving with the wind. I had to continue on to work so I never got to see it leave. It gave me kind of an Eeerie feeling because I felt it was watching me. If I had a camera and took a photo it would have been just a small silver dot on the photo with little detail. It was shiny and looked silver to me because it did have a glare off it. It basically looked like a Silver Ball hanging in the air.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
an unexplainable occurrence;2004-06-27 04:14:00;5 seconds;an unexplainable occurrence This is my report, June 27, 2004 at 4:14 am.  I am driving southbound on Jester Blvd. towards Ranch Road 2222.  We had just left my friend Tony's house on Crab Tree Road.  I have made it about a quarter mile away from Tony's house.  I had the fog lights turned on because there was so much fog i could hardly see 30 feet in front of the car and I am driving very slow because of the weather conditions as well as the many deer out in that neighborhood.  Plus I am driving my room mates 2004 Nissan 350Z Roadster and I am very aware and careful when driving his car.  I am heavily concentrating in the foggy road ahead then all of a sudden I see this green light right there in the fog in front of us in the sky.  it seemed to be about 50 to 100 feet high from the ground.  If I had to guess I would think it was about the size of a school bus.  The object flew from the right to the left covering about 100 yards within 1 or 2 seconds, then it disappeared.  At that moment I was barely able to get the words out of my mouth to my friend What was that? and as he is saying Did you see that? the object appears again after it not being there for at least 3 seconds and it seemed as soon as it reappeared it shot upward into the sky at a left kind of angle, the same direction it just shot towards, but upward this time.  I had two lady friends following us in their car riding together.  As soon as this happened I was concerned and pulled immediately over.  My friends pull up in their car next to me and I ask them Did you see that?   The passenger (Lisa) says That thing in the sky?  I thought I was just seeing things.  And the driver (Robin) says See what?  So I know that since Lisa saw it that there is no way it was a reflection, or anything we were able to comprehend.  We only stayed about long enough to pause for a moment and then we decided to go ahead and continue to head home.  I looked down at the radio and the time was 4:14 am.  I do not know what time it was prior to leaving, but I honestly do not think there was any missing time lapse.  The more we spoke about it, the stranger it seemed.  I was driving a 2004 Nissan 350Z convertible and even though the top was up, we never heard a sound of a helicopter or a plane.  The headlights on the car are florescent lights and gives a good visual in the conditions we were in and there was nothing to justify what we saw.  Grand-it was 4:14 am and you may be thinking what were we doing up so late, that we must have been drinking and just seeing things.  And I will admit we had been drinking earlier that night out at a bar, but had not had a drink for over 2 hours, since last call in Texas is 2 am.  I had had 3 beers all night long and was totally sober and the designated driver.  For the record.  So anyway, Yesterday I was thinking still how strange this occurrence was and that I wanted to find out more.  I was thinking of calling my local Airport, but thought asking some desk clerk about a UFO she would think I was nuts.  So I got on the internet.  I came across www.ufocenter.com and thought this is who I need to contact and report this strange sighting.  So I spoke with Peter Davenport on the phone.  He asked me to document this report and this is what I am doing.  Mr. Davenport took my report verbally and during the process he has pointed out some things that now has me a little worried.  I am referring to Sleep Paralysis.  Just last night, one day after this incident I had what I call a Sleep Paralysis Attack.  I will not get too into it, but it sure is strange timing.  I have these attacks maybe about once every year or year and a half since I was about 12 years old.  You can do a google.com search for sleep paralysis and read up more on it.  I did not have any visual during my attack.  So in detail about the object in the sky.  I will describe this object in the sky that I can not identify as anything I have ever seen.  Like I mentioned earlier the soul foundation of the object appeared to be about the size of a school bus.  It was long and narrow.  It had this distinct green light glowing in the shape of a bus.  And underneath the largest green light I described was this thin green line the same width of the large object.  And to the right of the object was a orange or red colored ball of light.  It all happened so fast, but the bright light of the object in the sky burned the image in my head and I can recall it like I am just seeing it now.  I will get my friends to try and give a statement of this occurrence as well.  I might be the only one out of us that is taking this so seriously, but I will try and get them to participate in anything you at the UFO Center need as well, because 3 out of the 4 of us were very fascinated and interested in what we saw.  Thank you for your time and interest in our story.

Afternoon sighting of stationary white spherical object;2007-09-09 17:00:00;10-15 minutes;Afternoon sighting of stationary white spherical object Late in the afternoon of a bright and clear day, my daughters and I were taking a walk along what is known as Auditorium Shores in downtown Austin Texas.  The Colorado River (or Town Lake as it is called) runs through the city of Austin and there is a green belt, with hike and bike trails running parallel to the river on both sides.  I was looking up at the sky, which was particularly blue with beautiful cumulous nimbus cloud formations, when I spotted a small white circular object almost directly above us.  The object appeared to be stationary and was positioned very high in the sky.  I was very surprised and I pointed it out to my two (almost) teenage daughters.  I tried to recognize it as possibly a planet, or a balloon or even a strange and bright star but could not say it was any of those things.  It was the same color as the beautiful cumulous nimbus clouds but of apparent solid structure with a definitive circumference.  We stopped walking and began to only observe the object.  Like I mentioned it appeared to be stationary, white in color and circular in shape.  While observing the object a large plane, which I recognized as a commercial airliner, flew near it and I was able to compare the object to the plane.   The object appeared to be higher in the atmosphere than the plane which looked pretty small.  The plane was at an angle as if it was climbing to cruising altitude.   The airliner cruised on by the object, strengthening my conviction that the object was not traveling in the sky, but was stationary.   I looked around often to observe the people out walking, running, biking and fishing along Town Lake.  No one appeared to be aware of the object.  We began walking again and periodically looking back up at the object.  After a few moments, my daughter started exclaiming that the object was breaking into two pieces!  I looked up again, refocused my gaze.  I too observed what appeared to now be two circular objects however their sides appeared to still be touching.   I readjuste! d my eye s for several different looks as I know that an object at a distance can appear to be two due to a trick of our eyes.  No matter how I readjusted my gaze the object did appear to be morphing into two circular objects.  After only a few moments, it appeared to morph back into one object again.  My daughter and I where exasperated and excited by the strange behavior!  A few minutes later, we came upon a man fishing and we stopped to point out the object to him.  Due to his confinement in a wheel chair and apparent poor eye sight he never was able to see the object.    He could not position his head to look almost directly above us to see the object.  The man felt it might be a planet and politely dismissed us.   Not wanting to appear strange I quickly agreed with him.  About that time a cloud began to move in front of the object.   I could still see it through the cloud cover for several more minutes but by this point the novelty was wearing off and we resumed our hike.   Even if it is a UFO, I thought to myself, it is positioned too far off and people where not even noticing it.   Nevertheless, I looked diligently in that area of the sky for the remainder of the hike and did not see the object again even though the cloud had moved on.  I took the man’s assumption that it was probably a planet to heart.  I felt that if it was a planet I would be able to see it when the clouds moved on, but I never saw it again during the rest of the day.   I scanned the whole sky looking for the object but it was gone.  So upon returning home I looked on the internet to see what planet might be visible to the naked eye during daylight hours at this time of year and at our location.  I could not find any information pertaining to a day time planet visibility for our area or anywhere near us for that matter.   I am baffled as to the odd behavior of the object and felt that if it was a planet it would not have apparently morphed into two objects nor would it disappear from view.   A planet would have remained on its path thro! ugh the sky.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

A Bluish-white object with glowing aura hurtles through the sky at great speeds;2009-05-14 23:15:00;2-3 seconds;A Bluish-white object with glowing aura hurtles through the sky at great speeds As I was jogging westward along 53rd St. past the intersection of Rowena, I saw out of the corner of my left eye, a bright object hurtling across the sky, above the trees.  I immediately looked at it as it traveled out of sight behind trees.  The whole episode last 2-3 seconds, long enough to train my eyes on the object as it went out of view. What it looked like was a spherical bright object shrouded within a hazy fog or glowing aura, traveling at very fast speed.  The color of the object was bright white with a bluish tint, or more accurately, the sphere was bright white while the glow surrounding it was bluish-white.  It seemed, instinctively, like a meteorite flying through the air but there were things about it that made me question that possibility.  One, the trajectory was straight and level, not at an angle downward.  Also, the shooting stars I've seen in the past have always been bright and sharply defined, never one with a glowing aura surrounding it.  That immediately seemed very odd and out of place.  Plus, the time that I was able to view the object, 2-3 seconds, doesn't sound like a long enough time but compared to the shooting stars I'm familiar with, it's almost an eternity.  Not only that, it didn't feel like it was going to dissipate, or burn out, as it went behind the trees but rather to continue on its present trajectory. If I was to describe it's dimension and where it was within the environment, I would say it was roughly 200-300 feet in the air and was traveling at 100 MPH+.  (It could've have been higher but then the speed would have been amazingly fast.  I would stay with the original estimation.)  The object appeared about 3-5 feet wide while the glow extended outward 10 feet or so and maybe 15-20 feet behind.  That would seem to suggest a trail (or a tail) but I couldn't really detect anything like a vapor trail or smoke. If push came to shove, I would say it could've been a significant meteorite, if I had to say it was anything identifiable.  But the color, trajectory and the glow seems to conflict with that hunch. That's about it.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Orange glowing orbs  floating gracefully and stopping in triangular and linear shapes.;2009-10-03 23:00:00;10 min;Orange glowing orbs  floating gracefully and stopping in triangular and linear shapes. On 10/03/09 four of my friends and I were driving through Manchaca Texas (just south of Austin), when my friend saw a light in the sky. He thought it was a light tower, but my other friend who's house we had just left said there are no light towers around here. Right after he said that we spotted another one. They seemed to be stationary in the sky. We stopped on a bridge over a creek to get a better look when all of a sudden they started to move. Next more of them, one by one, started to appear seemingly from the creek. Three of them formed a perfect triangle and then a perfectly straight line(stopping for a few seconds each time). We sat on the bridge for about 10 minutes and saw about 15 or 20 orbs floating/dancing oddly but gracefully through the sky. As I stared at them individually I could not tell exactly how close or far away they where, or what was making them glow. When we started driving away I kept looking back and saw them spanning the whole s! kyline behind us. Regretfully none of us got any pictures or videos. But I found pictures and video online from some sightings in the UK that looks exactly like what we saw. That was probably the craziest thing I have ever experienced. Now I carry a video camera with me everywhere now.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Silver metallic spherical object moving in the afternoon sky over Austin.;2010-11-02 14:00:00;40 secs;Silver metallic spherical object moving in the afternoon sky over Austin. From the passenger seat of our SUV, my wife observed an object in the sky, she called my attention to it, as I drove at about 20-25 mph through city streets near our home.  What we saw was a very shiny, reflective, silver, metallic, mostly spherical object, with a somewhat smaller, delta shaped lower section at its base.  It appeared in plain sight, its skin and contours sleek.   The object was to our east, alternately moving through the sky from north to south and hovering.  We remarked to each other that this was nothing like the planes we often see in our neighborhood, which is on the local international airport flightpath.  It also did not look like a weather balloon or anything like a balloon.   The weather was clear and there were few if any clouds and no obstructions to our field of view. The object was moving at less than 1000 feet over the horizon, and its widest, its size was probably about 10-15 feet.   I happened to have a camera in my vehicle, I reached to grab it so I could take pictures, we both turned away for a moment, but the object had disappeared as we turned to look at it again.   The object's altitude was high enough that if it had been a conventional plane, we would have still seen it moving, either descending or ascending over the horizon, as any other plane that flew to or away from the airport. Moments later, looking out to the sky in the southwest, still in our general vicinity, we observed what appeared to be a delta shaped, bottom side of a flying aircraft, maybe a military fighter jet.  The color of the bottom side of the craft was dark or perhaps black and the craft was moving fast at about the same altitude, moving from east to west and appeared to be banking sharply away to the south, in the direction of the international airport.

100+ solid white objects/lights traveling SE to NW at 500-1500 feet overhead.;2013-05-31 22:00:00;30 minutes;100+ solid white objects/lights traveling SE to NW at 500-1500 feet overhead. While at a friend's house for a pool party, I happened to glance up at the southeastern sky and what I saw was unlike anything I'd seen before.  To my amazement, there was approximately 100 solid white lights moving very rapidly in formation in a northwesterly direction.  At that point I asked the group to look up and confirm what I was seeing.  Everyone was in agreement as to the description but no one in the 7-10 people there could explain what we were seeing.  The objects were moving at a high rate of speed (100+ mph) and there was no sound!  The formation was random with the objects following a consistent flight path.  As the group thinned, there were several small clusters of objects and finally, one was following at a considerable distance behind the others.  The large cluster and subsequent smaller clusters as well as the last few solo objects/lights traveled directly overhead, approximately 500-1500 feet directly above us as we watched in amazement.  The duration of the event was probably 20+ minutes.  As we watched the objects fade into the distance over Lake Travis or in that general direction, the sky began to get hazy with some low level cloud cover. We continued to watch the sky and probably 15-20 minutes after the initial event subsided, we glimpsed a similar formation much higher, above the haze/clouds traveling in the opposite direction. This time since the objects were much higher, they seemed to be moving much more slowly and at times appeared to stop. We eventually lost site of the objects/lights after about another 15-20 minutes as the cloud cover increased.  Conditions: clear sky, no clouds during the first period of sighting then low level haze/clouds during the last period.  We all snapped multiple photos with our phones and recorded video. Unfortunately, most photos and videos were way too dark to see any significant detail. I have posted the best two photos we captured. What we witnessed could not be explained that night and we still have no explanation.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Spherical object moving through clouds at sunset creating sets of &quotsmoke&quot rings.;2013-07-06 20:00:00;5 seconds;Spherical object moving through clouds at sunset creating sets of &quotsmoke&quot rings. We were at Mt Bonnell watching the sunset.  We had just regular 7x50 binoculars with us and switching those between us. There were couple planes flying overhead and we can clearly see them through the binoculars.  The skies were full of clouds and we could see the planes disappear into the clouds. Each plane was leaving a straight line of white steam from its wings. I was watching one plane to the north west when I saw a reflection of the Sun on some type of metallic sphere.  I only saw it for about 2-3 seconds as it passed at an angle where the Sun would have reflected briefly. However it was enough time for me to get the direction in which it was moving.  	It was already near a big cloud and it created what I can only describe as a set of giant smoke rings that were just being spread from what at that point appeared to be nothing. The observing conditions were perfect and since I was watching planes up that point I got a pretty good idea of the scale of that object.  It was at least as big as a 747 or slightly larger. This happened very quickly and I heard no sounds from that direction.  The distance between us and the object was about 15 miles.  My son saw the flash, but since I was the one looking through the binoculars he did not see any of the smoke rings. Basically this looked like a giant mirror like chrome marble floating through clouds.  I've never seen anything like this before or since.  What is bothering me is that I have absolutely no logical explanation as to what that was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

What made this orb unique from all the other orbs I've witnessed (I've had more than a few UAP encounters) was that it had a fiery orange/red vapor trail behind it.  This thing was moving very fast like I said it was only visible for a couple seconds, but I knew right away that it wasn't any conventional aircraft or pyrotechnics display...  And it was totally silent as per usual. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report provides no contact information.  PD));30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
This is the second time I have witnessed such a craft hovering generally above my house.;2019-01-20 13:00:00;30 seconds;This is the second time I have witnessed such a craft hovering generally above my house. At approximately 1:00pm, I was in the front yard and saw a small metallic orb.  It was towards the sun and reflected brightly, as an airplane would. Distance and altitude is unknown and was unable to be judged. It shot right then left then right at break neck speeds then stopped.  It -was not- an airplane etc. (I know the difference between terrestrial or man made objects and UFO's.)  I ran inside to grab my binoculars and went to the back yard.  Within the 15 seconds this took, the object was gone.  I scanned the sky for a considerable amount of time.  Any airplane would have still been in the proximity for the 15 seconds it took to run through my house.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
Two glowing spheres that changed direction at different times.;2019-02-15 20:33:00;1 minute;Two glowing spheres that changed direction at different times. Two glowing spheres seen in sky north of the airport at first moving together in the same direction.  Emitting yellow to orange light which was very different than the lights of a jetliner that was on approach to the airport.  Both were coming towards us, but then at different times, they changed, and started moving away. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report describes herself as a medical professional.  Witness provides high-quality video, which shows two orange lights, moving from right to left across the field of view of the video camera.  PD));30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

About 20 minutes later I noticed a plane at a high speed underneath.  The sun came up I noticed it was a plane with a chemical trail behind it.  To the right I seen a bright orb.  It disappeared quickly after two minutes max.  I noticed this dark cloud with a bright light from the top of the cloud and a bunch of planes coming out of it from the top right.  They too were producing a trail.  I noticed one plane coming out the bottom left as well.  Then a smaller orb close to were the plane was.  The orb disappeared fairly quickly.  The other orb was faint and didn’t stay long. I also noticed a bomber plane while I was driving toward Camp Mabry disappear not cut through a cloud just not visual.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
2 planes that disapeared from view followed by 2 stationary bright  orange &quotobjects&quot;2020-06-13 21:15:00;1 minute;2 &quotplanes&quot that disapeared from view followed by 2 stationary bright  orange &quotobjects&quot Hello,  I saw something strange last night pictures attached) that may or not be of potential interest to you.  Around 9:15 p.m., my wife and I  (both PhDs in different fields) were getting back home from our usual evening walk in our South Austin neighborhood.    While arriving toward the last bend of the road before the straight stretch of road that reaches our house, we saw looking West  what seemed to be two approaching planes.   What looked strange to us is that the furthest away “plane “ was catching up with the one closest to us.  Then they both suddenly disappeared from our view.  A few seconds later, at another spot also looking West, we saw two bright orange lights what seemed to be stationary in the sky.  Looking at them for a minute, they did not move at all.     I took pictures with my iphone , first of the two “planes” before they disappeared from our view, then of the two stationary orange lights.   We then kept walking back home. Maybe this is nothing, but just-in-case, the pictures are being sent via email.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
yellow orange possibly transparent sphere of light;2020-08-29 15:30:00;4 seconds;yellow orange possibly transparent sphere of light While I was talking on the phone with a friend I looked out my window to the east and saw a glowing, possibly transparent, yellow orange ball of light hovering about one or two miles away.  From my point of view it was about half the size of a penny.  When I went out to my front balcony to get a better look it was gone.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
