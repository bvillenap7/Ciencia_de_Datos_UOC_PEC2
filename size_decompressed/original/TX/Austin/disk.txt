Seven year old son brought home artwork from school, explaining it was what he had seen. (Attached).  He reported a saucer shaped object hovering over the house.  It could be seen through the ceiling/roof of the house because it has become transparent.  He saw globes of light drifting down from the ship. Separate memory - same time frame:  remember being chased around the house by animals with huge black eyes. Object parked at end of driveway.

Saw a fast movin UFO on the way back from getting a pizza.;1997-05-25 19:30:00;30 seconds - 1 minute;Saw a fast movin UFO on the way back from getting a pizza. A friend and I where on  our way back from getting a pizza. I looked up and observed a rapid moving single white light. It ziged and zaged, and it moved faster than anything I have ever seen. I asked my friend if he was seeing it to(because my friend had 15 years in the Air Force, I figured if it was a plain, he would know), and he replied Yeah, what the hell was it. It was on a fairly well traveled road. The light continued to zig and zag for about a minute.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

The size was like something 5 inches in diameter, held at arm's length.  Surface was dull metallic, illuminated by city lights, a pink glow.  It was completely silent and had no exhaust, no visible running lights.  Path was a slight arc across sky towards southwest.  It lasted approx. 1 minute.  I immediately called a MUFON field investigator, reported details at approx 9:05.  I am a trained observer with a private pilot's license, a graduate of the MUFON Field Investigator Class, and was wearing lenses which correct my vision to 20/20.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
The craft shot a ray of solid light up into the sky and connected to what appeared to be a star.;2000-11-01 01:00:00;30 seconds;The craft shot a ray of solid light up into the sky and connected to what appeared to be a star. One night while I was on my property, I observed a huge craft suspended out in front of me over the lake. The craft was shaped like a saucer. The lights on the object initially caught my eye. There were 10 to 20 lights in rows across the middle of the saucer. They were fairly dim and slowly changing in color. The colors were light green, light brown, light orange, and yellow. I immediatly knew that it was something that I'd never seen before. The speed in which it moved was very deceiving. It slowly moved higher in the sky in front of me and just when it was almost out of sight, I witnessed a solid ray of light shoot from the object up in to the sky an connect to a brightly glowing object that was fixed in the sky. Then the object seemed to follow the ray of light up closer to the bright light and finally disappeared. When it was gone, to my surprise, the bright light remained because it was what appeared to be a star. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

Small saucer camouflages itself at dusk and speeds off;2008-11-17 18:45:00;30 seconds;Small saucer camouflages itself at dusk and speeds off All I can tell (from what I managed to see) is that it was a small saucer coming out from behind a tree.  The saucer sort of turned itself invisible in the blink of an eye, and blurred my eyesight for about 10 full minutes.  From what I could tell, the saucer details were very complicated.  It looked a lot like a stretched out black and white picture of saturn under a shadow.  The above description is what my daughter said she saw.  It happened while she was walking her dog in the greenbelt near our house.  On her way back home at dusk, she saw this UFO and she also said that after it became shadowy black to blend in more with the sky, it shot off at a very fast speed away from her, which would have been in a southerly direction.  She said that her cell phone stopped working for a few seconds so she could not call me immediately after the incident.  She made a drawing of what she saw very soon after getting home so I will scan it and email it.  Would be nice if you can email me with a case number so I can reply to your email with the scanned image.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

New Years Eve Unkown object in the sky above Downtown Austin Texas;2009-12-31 23:46:00;5 minutes;New Years Eve Unkown object in the sky above Downtown Austin Texas Right before Midnight on New Years ever, we were standing on 6th street downtown Austin, Texas in front of the Silver New Years eve ball with a big crowd of people. We waiting for the countdown to New Years Eve, there was music playing, people dancing, balloons etc. It was very cold and there fast moving clouds in the sky. The Moon was very Bright that night allowing you to see past the clouds and the stars beyond. I was standing there and looking at the Bright Moon along with a huge search/event light from some event somewhere circling back and forth against the clouds and the sky. As I was watching and starring at the moon, my eyes caught a dark, round dot looking thing moving inside the fast moving clouds. It was hard to see but you can at times clearly see it was round as if watching a perfect dot (circle) in the sky and dark, it was jerking back and forth in different patterns. Moving very fast, back and forth in different patterns and directions. Then it stopped and lit up very bright and it was gone. As soon as I noticed it the first time I pointed it out to my son and my wife. He could not see what I was looking at , at first, then he noticed it right before it lit up and he said after it lit up it took off at a hi rate of speed. My wife was also trying to see it and she got a glimpse of it at the last moment. I was pointing up at it trying to get the crowd to see it, but did! n’t notice anyone else looking at it, besides the search/event light would have made them look at that first and distract from the object. Balloons were being released and I compared the object to a balloon but balloons never made it that hi up and would not have been as big at that height.  I work as a computer engineer my son is active duty army. The object was directly above us when noticed. If it was a balloon it would have been much smaller and harder to see at that height, along with why did it light up then disappear?;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888

10/08/14, 5:55 AM, Pictures of a ship around the moon as it was in Eclipse.;2014-10-08 05:50:00;15 minutes;10/08/14, 5:55 AM, Pictures of a ship around the moon as it was in Eclipse. I was visiting in Austin, TX.  The night of the lunar eclipse I couldn’t sleep so I went out side for a walk.  I wanted to see the eclipse, and it was a perfectly clear sky.  I sat in a chair on front lawn and watched and took pictures. I could see the planes going into Austin airport, very specific flight patterns. I saw a large disc form come from above left of the moon.  It came down and then around to the right of the moon, seemed to stay to the right for a moment or two and then took off at an angle to the left and up. When it paused near the right side of the moon it looked to be about 20% the size of the moon itself.  This was as the moon was finishing the eclipse at 5:55 AM, I put my camera on long exposure, but I shook a bit for that. I have been given what this was through communication with them, immediately upon looking at my camera that night/morning. My background:  I AM in communication with various ET’s.  I have been most of my life, but never made this public before.  My parents, husband, daughter and extremely close friends know of this and have been present various times when this has happened. I have seen several ships in my lifetime.  Some recent dramatic sightings:  3 years ago at Enchanted Rock, TX, when we made it to the top and were resting,  I lay down on the summit and they (several) appeared for me.  It was late afternoon.  My husband was there and saw them as well.  There were no others around on the summit. 3 yrs ago in Galveston, I was sitting at poolside I was speaking on my cell to my friend back east, 2 AM, and a golden-brownish color ship flew over.  It was very low, just above the buildings.  I projected my thought to it … “wait” and it stopped, hovered, so I could get a good look at it, and then it flew on out over the ocean.  The friend I was speaking to also has communicated with ET’s. 2 years ago and last year I was interacting with some Beings from the inner Earth.  There were 12, and they followed me when we went into the caves outside Austin.  I have pictures of that communication underground.  They came back above ground when I was outside one night at my daughter’s house, very interesting. I attended and assisted for the entire week, the Paradigm Research Group at the Citizens Hearing on Disclosure, April/May 2013 at the National Press Club in DC.  I fully believe in the fact there are benevolent ET’s close around Earth and in our immediate Solar System.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
I swear I thought I was crazy and almost ran off the road.  Whatever this was it was not a plain, balloon etc. it was flying low.;2015-05-08 20:26:00;5 minutes;I swear I thought I was crazy and almost ran off the road. whatever this was it was not a plain, balloon etc..  It was flying low enough for me to clearly see.  It was silver in color with a red light and on the bottom of the craft was a giant eye as if it was observing the area.  It was not a real eye but like a giant glass eye that covered the bottom of the craft.  It was flying slow enough for me to clearly see.  I drove home in a daze because I did not want to admit what I saw.  Never in my life has such a event happened.  Maybe I am wrong or just plain crazy, but I can't deny what I saw.

Flying saucer descends, possibly lands in North Austin nature trail.;2017-05-05 11:30:00;3 seconds;Flying saucer descends, possibly lands in North Austin nature trail At approximately 11:30 AM I was on the balcony of my apartment when I saw a flying object descending in the sky very rapidly.  It traveled from west to east over Walnut Creek where it appeared to land on the trail.  It definitely went below the tree line. This was near Brentwood Christian School on North Lamar. The craft was about 150m from my apartment, approximately 100 feet in the air and looked like it could have had a diameter of maybe 50 feet, but I didn't see the top of it clearly. It was shaped like an upside-down saucer and it had a clearly metallic surface, like brushed aluminum.  It wasn't wobbling or tumbling or anything like that, just a very smooth controlled descent. I heard no sound at all.  I would not have noticed this object if I hadn't already been looking directly at the sky. Choosing to remain anonymous unless other people come forward with having seen something. ((NUFORC Note:  We would like to communicate with this witness, and we would like to have the witness contact the local news media, in order to encourage other witnesses to come forward.

Bright silvery object that appeared to change back and forth from a tube to a saucer high above Austin, TX;2017-10-26 16:00:00;2 minutes;Bright silvery object that appeared to change back and forth from a tube to a saucer high above Austin, TX I was looking up at the clear blue sky with a neighbor when we saw a silver object shooting across the sky at a very high altitude.  She called it a high flying jet, but I noted that it was was not leaving a con trail.  It first appeared to have two sections or wings and was traveling length wise like a tube.  But as it passed overhead in a straight line it appeared to bank and looked somewhat saucer shaped at two different times and flames shot out one time for a short distance sideways to its direction of travel across the sky.;30.3106535248193;-97.7600825627888
