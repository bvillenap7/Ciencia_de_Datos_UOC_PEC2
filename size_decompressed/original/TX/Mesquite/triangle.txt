triangle headed west toward downtown dallas;1998-09-27 01:15:00;1min;triangle headed west toward downtown dallas About 0105 I came outside for a smoke and look for meteors, looking to the NE I watched for a few minutes when I noticed a movement. 3 very dim lights in a triangular shape faded into view, pale orange in color, moving slow headed west. It seemed very low and had no FAA required strobes,and was silent. I've never given much thought to seeing a UFO but here was one, Ive lived near airports all my life and can tell most aircraft just from their light pattern. It took about 3 seconds to realize this was nothing Ive seen before. It passed directly overhead slowly then faded into the light pollution to the west. I was freaked out about it, and as I stood there a brilliant light shot back in the opposite direction that the triangle had come from at a teriffic speed. Five seconds later a commercial airliner from Love Field came into view, headed east. It must have been seen by the 737, but I dont know if they reported it. I haven't till now. I keep up with aircraft developments and this didn't fit the bill. It doesn't even make bad sense to make a secret test flight the wrong way down one of the most crowded outbound flight paths in the US. Needless to say, I look up a lot since then.;32.778124033438;-96.6097817136879
