Solid grey object moving fast over house;2003-12-21 23:00:00;5 seconds;Solid grey object moving fast over house I was outside at 11:00pm to get a break from a movie I was watching.  I looked up at the stars to see what was available to my telescope.  While looking at Orions belt which was straight up I noticed a Grey object flying fast. It was not a blurring speed. It was about the size of my thumb at an arms length. There were no lights and no sound. It moved from right to left over my house and out of view.  I tried to make the shape out but couldn't because it was so dark and it moved pretty fast. I tried to determine what it could have been. I came to no conclusion. All I know is I got an erie feeling as I watched it cruise on by.;32.778124033438;-96.6097817136879
Bright White/Yellow object seen in sky no FFA lights.;2005-03-08 21:00:00;2 Minutes;Bright White/Yellow object seen in sky no FFA lights. Last Night about 9:00pm CST I was taking the dog out for a walk. I always look up at the stars to see whats out. There were many planes in the air beacause we are close to DFW and Love Field. I also am familiar with the flight patterns and what planes look like at night.  As I was looking up there was a very bright yellow light moving at the speed of a normal plane. Nothing spectacular, only bizarre thing that kept my eyes fixed on it was there were no FFA lights on it. Nothing was blinking at all. It also made no noise that I could hear. It just stayed a solid white/yellow color.   Usually as a planes landing lights move away from you they dim.  This object stayed the same brightness from directly above me to as far as I could see it move across the sky, from NE to SW.  It was just very different from the other 5 planes that I could see.  Could it have been a helicopter?  I don't think so it was pretty high but unusually bright and with no noise.  There were planes much higher than this object and I could make them out with no problem. Most of all because of their FFA lights.  This was something different. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date of the incident to March 8th, since the report was submitted at noon on March 9th.  We believe the witness refers to the FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration, not the FFA, which might be the Future Farmers of America.  PD));32.778124033438;-96.6097817136879
Bright white glowing object in the southern sky;2007-05-16 21:45:00;10 seconds;Bright white glowing object in the southern sky At about 9:45pm last night my wife and I were out looking at stars particularly Venus.  At about that time I looked up to see Saturn.  All of a sudden to the south almost straight up, I saw an object light up as bright as Venus and about the same white color.  This was very bright and seemed very high in the sky.  I told my wife, what is that?   At that moment it reduced the bright white glow to almost nothing.  I could however still see it.  I didn't see any flashing lights nor did it change colors.  It was like a hot amber color that was very dim and slowly traveled south east.  I wondered if it was a satellite but I have never in all my years saw a satellite that lit up like that. Also it must be generating some large energy source to be that bright at that altitude. Very strange..;32.778124033438;-96.6097817136879
Loud FAST aircraft over Mesquite, Texas last night shortly after midnight!;2008-01-28 00:28:00;unknown, 10 seconds maybe;Loud FAST aircraft over Mesquite, Texas last night shortly after midnight! Last night I was woke to the sound of some sort of VERY loud engine of some sort of very loud aircraft.  It seemed to have been in close proximity above my house (based on the sound).  The sound which woke me from sleep was VERY loud and VERY deep...it was nearly deafening!  Once I had been woken, it lasted for probably 8 to 10 seconds.  I can't say how long it had been there since I had previously been asleep.  But then, it departed FAST!  It was so fast that within a second, all noise was completely gone!  The sound changed and you could tell it became very distant VERY fast (and sounded almost as if it had sucked the atmosphere as it departed, if that makes sense).  Whatever it was, was way faster than any plane I had ever heard!  I was afraid to go outside at first (this thing was seriously loud, it had shaken me up!), but after a few minutes (after having heard it depart at such an astronomical speed) I went out to look in the sky and saw nothing and no trace.  There was a full cover of very white clouds in the sky though (which was weird being it was at night, and that they were so bright) but none of them seemed to be disturbed.  There is supposed to be a military facility that deals in top secret aircraft outside of Rockwall Texas (away from Mesquite).  My guess is, it was probably a very VERY fast military craft (faster than ANYTHING made public).  I guess that the sightings in Stephensville, TX may also be accounted for by whatever inventions are going on outside of Rockwall.  I just thought I'd share this.  Would be curious to find out if anyone actually saw it.;32.778124033438;-96.6097817136879
2 lights above some houses that moved away from each other and they were low to the ground.;2008-10-17 09:00:00;1min;2 lights above some houses that moved away from each other and they were low to the ground. I was Riding with my mom and 2 brothers in the car and my mom saw 2 lights in the sky above some houses, I looked and I saw 2 lights moving in a directional angle, the top one was moving slowly upwards to the left, and the bottom one was moving a bit faster to the right going down.;32.778124033438;-96.6097817136879
