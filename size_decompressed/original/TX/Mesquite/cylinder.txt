3 mysterious lights in southern sky moving quickly westward;2008-10-09 08:35:00;3 minutes;3 mysterious lights in southern sky moving quickly westward First off I realize that my sighting took place almost 2 months ago but that is only because I just now found out about this website. I did though contact the local police department to inform them of what I had seen as well as to inquire as to if anyone else viewed this activity. On the evening of Thursday, October 9, 2008 I was on my way home from the store and noticed in the southern sky 3 white lights in a row. I immediately called my father and he informed me that it was most likely a blimp as one had been seen in the area earlier in the day. Assuming that was the case I pulled into my driveway fully expecting to see the outline of the blimp as it was a clear night and the lights were very close to the ground. In an instant the lights moved westward and then seemed to disappear in the western sky. Due to the speed in which the vehicle reached a blimp is discounted. It is important to note that there was no sound when this happened yet the movement was quick and fluid. I was fortunate enough to get this on video.;32.778124033438;-96.6097817136879
UFO'S over Mesquite, TX.;2014-04-05 22:20:00;11:09;UFO'S over Mesquite, TX Today April 5, 2014, I 10:20pm, I was driving by down town Mesquite, TX, when I noticed weird looking lights as I continue to drive I noticed the lights had a greenish back color to them.  As I proceeded to pulling over to get other witnesses to look and testify what they had saw to others we all noticed the lights clearly outlined a ship.   In the streets there was over 20 eye witnesses besides myself.  I call fox 4 news and made a report.  Iâ€™m hoping to get answers asap.   The lights where so bright yet my phone could not capture them on film.  However, another lady was able to capture it and I am working on having the film uploaded as I type.   I am now a firm believer that we are not alone the question is what do they want and why are they making their presence known now?
