Seeing it the first time changed my life. But this time, it was about 150m off the ground, 100 meters out, my significant other and I saw it turning and heading North by Northwest, traveling at about 100mph,  Completely silent,  Although the last time I saw it, it was far closer, about 60m out and only about 40m off of the ground,and when the engine started accelerating away from us, my brother and I only felt its vibrations in the air around us, and closer almost completely silent, so if you could not see it, you could not hear it. It was the shape of a diamond, laying horizontally, and very transparent. But not entirely. I was able to gauge its distance from us due to my (thankfully) acute depth perception. When it took off from where my brother and I could see it, it didn't go out of the sightlines we could see the sky it went straight out of the atmosphere, so quickly that within a matter of seconds, it was out of our sight because of the distance. Easily breaching 1500 G The human body can take what? 8-12 times the force of gravity? If anything human was in there, they would be reduced to mush. While in this (very) recent occurrence, it was farther away, and traveling the provided compass bearing, but much slower, it still exited my available sightlines fairly quickly. I know more details of this aircraft because of my mentioned, closer encounter,in this same area! But even at the farther distance I am 100% sure it was the same aircraft in nature. Conclusively, I hope this report helps whoever reads this figure out more about these strange, MASSIVE aircrafts' flight plans. Godspeed.;32.778124033438;-96.6097817136879
