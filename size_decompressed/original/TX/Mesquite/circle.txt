Small dim circle of  light  close to  Moon began moving in a wide circle & moved away but was chased by a light from area of Moon;2005-10-28 19:20:00;4+ minutes;Small dim circle of  light  close to  Moon began moving in a wide circle & moved away but was chased by a light from area of Moon A round dim light was seen while attending the Tyler Robert E. Lee vs Mesquite High School Football game.  Just before the game started I noticed the light to my left.  I beleive I was facing West sitting in the East stands.  The full moon was high in the sky approximately at an angle of 50 degrees West from where I was sitting and 55 degrees approximately above the horizen.  Looking at the Moon just before Kickoff about 7:20 p.m. I noticed a dim very small circle of light hanging in the sky very close to the Moon. I tryed to get my wife to notice it but she was more interested in the introductions for the game. There was to much noise on the field and in the stands to get anyone close to notice the light.  It was almost to dim to catch anyones attention.  Within about three minutes the light started to move.  It was obviously a great distance away. Perhaps very close to the distance of the moon. The light moved very slowly, at least to me it appeared slowly away from the Moon to the East a short distance.  It was definitely not a star or planet.  It turned up and made a tight turn back toward the Moon and continued the turn until it approached the path it had previously taken in the East. It continued the Easterly direction and was either moving away or down when an even smaller ligth emerged from either the Moon or from behind it. The smaller light was a little brighter than the large light but not by much.   It seemed to head toward earth for a moment then turned at a much higher speed and appeared to race after the larger light.  As it reached the larger light, they both faded out and disappeared. I didn't see a collision.  The lights were definitely under the control of an intelligent sourse. The large light was to me about the size of a pin head and the smaller light about a third that size.  Obviously they had to be extremely large objects to be seen that far away and their movement was deliberate.  I really doubt that anyone else saw these lighted objects because the were so dim, so smal! l and we re only visable for such a short time.  I guess I should have stood up and shouted for others to look but at first I expected to discover some natural cause for the big light and the small one moved quickly and was gone in about 30 seconds. The lights of the object did not shine like an electric light sourse but were rather dull. However they were extremely far away. The larger light was about the color of the yellowish Moon and the small light a little whiter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness corrects date of sighting, which was October 28, 2005.
