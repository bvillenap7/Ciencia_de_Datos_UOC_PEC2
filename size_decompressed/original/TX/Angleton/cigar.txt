Bayou Cigar UFO 1973;1973-07-15 02:00:00;5 minutes;Bayou Cigar UFO 1973 It was late at night in the summer of 73.  It was very hot. we had no AC so the windows were open.  I was about 8 years old and thought I was having a dream.  A very VIVID dream. The crickets where chirping and frogs etc. then the wind picked up and the noise stopped.  The wind died and it was quiet. I woke up (still dreaming).  I went through the kitchen to the back door of the house.  Our house was only about 100 yards from the bayou.  I walked from my back door to a stand of trees about 20 yards from the house.  There was a tree fort in the one closest to the house.  As i got to the tree house a big gust of wind picked up and a bright light. after a few seconds the light faded to black and the wind died off.  You could see a silhouette of a cigar shaped object about 50 foot long or so. it was black with no visible windows or lights.  It maneuvered over the bayou and after a short time sent three beams of light into the water. yellow, red and green and they moved in a triangle pattern. then they turned off. after a few moments it had moved up the bayou and did the same thing. then it slowly moved up the bayou and was gone.  I sat staring at the darkness. then the frogs and crickets started again. that's when I woke up.   I was in my bed and thought what a crazy dream.  I got up to use the restroom and pulled back sheet.  My feet were covered in wet grass and mud.  (NO DREAM) I would not have ever walked out there AWAKE too many water moccasins.;29.1779;-95.446
