Massive spherical object glowing bright orange between Bailey's Prairie, TX and Angleton, TX.;1975-07-15 05:00:00;5 minutes;Massive spherical object glowing bright orange between Bailey's Prairie, TX and Angleton, TX. My husband was retrieving the morning newspaper when he noticed a huge, bright orange spherical object slowly moving downward in the western sky.  He hurried into the house and beckoned me to view the object from our bedroom window. The object was massive, spherical, and glowing bright orange.  It was visibly moving downward at a slow pace, and disappeared from view after passing behind trees.  The object would have been between Bailey's Prairie, TX and Angleton, TX.  My husband and I never drank or used drugs. We have seen the moon glowing orange, but this object was not the moon.  If it had been the moon, the surface textures would have been visible.  The object was glowing much more intensely, with a bright orange light, and had no visible surface features. There was no sound. The day and time are approximate, but the sighting definitely took place in the mid 1970s, and in the early morning hours (before the sun was up).  The entire sighting lasted approximately five minutes.;29.1779;-95.446
