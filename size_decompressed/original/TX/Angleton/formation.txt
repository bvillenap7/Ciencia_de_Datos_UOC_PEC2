One ship or three hovering?;2011-08-20 20:30:00;2 minutes;One ship or three hovering? The sky was dark, the land around is all flat and is used for farming. There are many acres surrounding the road I was on.  I was coming around a bend in the road when in the sky I spotted 3 lights not moving.  They were in this formation . :  This could be one UFO with 3 lights or three UFOs.  I kept driving toward the lights which were ahead of me to the right, which appeared to be hovering over one of the pastures.   I was baffled, I was running many different air crafts through my mind to see if it would make sense before concluding it as a UFO.  Nothing came to mind to compare to this, the lights were not moving.  Again, I kept on and as I went around a different bend in the road  an 18wheeler came around towards me and his light shined bright and I went to keep towards the lights and in an instant they were gone.  I know someone else had to have seen this...  This was very visible. Im still at a loss for words on this subject.
