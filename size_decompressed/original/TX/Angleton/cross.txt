Vertical, symmetrical key-shaped or awl-shaped, terrestrial (?) craft, as outlined by 8-to-10 red lights.;1999-10-06 20:35:00;5 minutes;Vertical, symmetrical key-shaped or awl-shaped, terrestrial (?) craft, as outlined by 8-to-10 red lights. Vertical, key-shaped UFO, with red lights ONLY on perimter. Length (horizon up) 3 units (estimated 90 feet) by 2 units (estimated 60 feet) with upper part shaped like bulge of car key (or awl-head), and lower part shaped like tapered area of key -- the shape of the the craft estimated by border of 8-to-10 red, pulsating lights on perimeter.  Lights were red and pulsed.  Time: 08:35 p.m. Central.  Conditions: Clear.  Sun completely down, (dark), clear, excellent visibility.  Observed UFO headed South-Southwest, bearing about 190 degrees, almost paralleling Texas State Highway 288 (about 45 miles due south of downtown Houston).  Altitude: Estimated 1000 feet.  Speed: Estimated 150-to-200 mph.  Obserbed UFO on west side of highway, then move gently to east side of highway, then gently back to west side of highway -- where it maintained (apparently) a steady 190 degree course.  This course would have brought it just west of the Brazoria County Airport, located at North 29.06.35, West 95.27.47.  Followed (at about 70 mph) the UFO for about 5 minutes -- keeping it in sight until its higher speed out-distanced me.  Typical lighting configuration for aircraft (green light, red light) NOT seen -- only red lights on perimeter.  Important -- this UFO's description is based on its VERTICAL appearance.  Have never before seen any aircraft with this type of configuration.  In short, it is aerodynamically impossible for this craft to have been flying using conventional flight systems.;29.1779;-95.446
