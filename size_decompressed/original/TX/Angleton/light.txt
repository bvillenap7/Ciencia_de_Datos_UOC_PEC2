Driving home from fishing, and saw a light in the sky.;1999-11-25 18:00:00;a few seconds;Driving home from fishing, and saw a light in the sky. Me and my girlfriend were driving home from fishing, on 288 north near angleton. While driving north I noticed a light in the sky maybe a couple of miles north of me, I just saw it. {I thought to myself should I tell my girlfriend to look or not. I have been having her look at almost every light in the sky, due to all this ufo stuff I hear on art bell.} But this light was like shimmering, and amber type orange. So I said to her, do you see that light? She looked ahead and said she see's it. Right as she said that the light just faded out. We both were like wow! And then it just re-appears at the one oclock position. We watched it for a second, and then it just faded out again. We did see a light that seemed similar, but it was very far in distance now. We thought we saw it again over some light towers near the tollway, but that light again just faded out. We don't know what the light was but it just seemed odd, a shimmering light that fades and re-appears in different locations.;29.1779;-95.446
