UFO following plane in Vapor trail;2009-06-01 20:13:00;3 min;UFO following plane in Vapor trail I, my wife and our 19 year old daughter saw what we first thought to be a smaller plane following a larger plane at the very end of its vapor trail. It was not the shape of a plane though. It appeared to be round and was very very bright! The large plane was traveling east towards DFW. It was 8:13 pm and was still very light outside. We watched the plane and the shining object until it went out of site and we could no longer see it. I went inside and called a local news channel (WFAA) to report what we had seen, and possibly get an explanation as to what it may have been. They said they would check on it.  I then looked up this site on the internet and spoke to Mr. Peter Davenport which encouraged me to make a report because so many sightings go unreported. I felt strongly enough about what we had seen, and felt compelled to share this information in hopes that someone else saw the same thing that we had seen. We are all certain it was not a plane!;33.1624;-96.3649999999999
