I don't feel like I am in control of my life !!!!;2002-06-01 02:00:00;1-2 hours  ?;I don't feel like I am in control of my life !!!! I am not sure how to go about this. So I guess I will shoot from the hip and see where this goes. I feel that I have been repeatedly abducted throughout my life. It seems to have been getting more frequent the older I get. Before these abductions take place I get an uneasy feeling and feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach. It's almost as if there is a field around me deliberately causing me to have these feelings. I go to sleep and sleep rather deeply during these times of uneasyness and wake up with the worst headache and body aches I have ever felt. The memories of these events seem to come in a few vague,foggy memories at a time. I remember a room that is probably the size of an average size living room 30'x 40',it's all metallic. There is a table in the middle of the room with an instrument of some kind above it. The walls of the room are a weird kind of composition because when it is touched it is like a weird soft gel like substance. I can't remember any experimants that are done to me (THANK GOD) but I do have pains in the back of my neck and  genital areas. I also seem to have a strange shape on my right hand in the shape of a triangle that is composed of three little dots and sometimes my hand will have a pain in the area where this shape is at. I don't know if anyone will believe me but I am telling the truth. I don't know how to stop this. I feel like I am not in control of my life here. CAn someone please give me some advice on this.
