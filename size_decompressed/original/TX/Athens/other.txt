Traveling 35mph on Beck's Chapel road, between Beck's Chapel Cemetery and another cemetery heading towards Cross Roads from Athens, two transparent (only reflect enough light from the high beams of my truck to she the shapes) mound looking shapes, side to side moved in a matter of split seconds to the right side of the of the road once we passed over the hill, but the tree limbs never moved. Not really sure what it is i saw, there we no lights coming from either object, and they moved so fast it's like they disappeared.
