Clear night sky, no weather.  Driving through Athens, Texas Tyler toward Waco, left turn.   At turn to left was church and just above saw green and red light, round but undefined, moving randomly.     Because of the unique nature of the light, I pulled to the side of the road to observe, thought the light may be from helicopter but realized the movement was to fast and to mobile.  The light moved as a spot light would on the bottom of clouds with random movement but there were no clouds and the lights appeared autonomous.  There were no beams associated either.   Then instantly the light moved at a high speed, just off vertical (greater than f-16 climb rate by factor of 8-10) and apparent size diminished to the vanishing point.

We saw a light in the night sky which appeared to be a satellite, but was moving much too fast.;2000-12-16 19:00:00;1 minute;We saw a light in the night sky which appeared to be a satellite, but was moving much too fast. First of all let me say this.  I love to watch those UFO shown on Discovery and TLC.  But I do so for entertainment purposes.  I think, or thought, the whole UFO thing was a bunch of bunk. But last night I saw something that was truly unknown to me.  I was standing outside a ham radio friend's house and we were talking about amateur satellites.  There were four of us in this group. A kid in the group started pointing out constelations.  When I started looking at what he was pointing out, I noticed what I thought was a satellite.  It appeared to be a star which was moving from south to north, and it tracked almost straight overhead. It looked just like a low orbit satellite (I've seen many of those before) but it was moving much too fast.  A low orbit satellite would take about 10 minutes to track across the night sky.  This object took under a minute. There were no flashing lights or sounds associated with this object.  In fact, I told the others it was probably a satellite, but I later decided that it couldn't have been.  Then I thought it could have been a piece of space junk entering the earth's atmosphere, but this object left no trail or flaming debris. I have ruled out in my mind all the possibilities.  As much as I hate to admit it, I have seen an Unidentified Flying Object. If you guys know what this light could have been, I would love to hear back from you.  I'm all out of explanations. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness was observing either Mir or the International Space Station passing overhead.  PD));32.2058272727272;-95.8097454545455
