It trhilled us all to know someone else had a sighting the same night we did.You said she was in lewisville, tx which is in the same direction the craft we saw would have passed over if it continued on the same path. How interesting!After our sighting of the low flying double triangle craft at malakoff,tx we came back to our home in athens and got my binoculars. As i told you we continued to see extremely heavy air traffic coming in from the south appearing to be at different alititudes.We drove toward the south then i stopped off of hiway 287 on 488, there was another aircraft coming toward us. I watched it with my binoculars. As it passed over i could clearly see a single triangle shaped aircraft with a white light on each corner and a red blinking light on the right tip.A green blinking light on the leftThe more i think about the aircraft at malakoff, if you took two of the single aircraft and connected them where there should be some kind of thrust output,then turned it sideways that would be exactly what i saw at the roadside park.I stated that the malakoff aircraft had 4 white lights, all the others had 3 lights, maybe when they docked with each other two of the lights on the rear are covered up by something.Then again maybe the single triangle aircraft were usaf stealth fighters following the aircraft i described at malakoff,tx.;32.2058272727272;-95.8097454545455
Unkonwn object in the night sky emitting 4 dim lit lights in a triangular form;2008-08-25 21:00:00;6-8 sec;Unkonwn object in the night sky emitting 4 dim lit lights in a triangular form My boyfriend and I went to the movies at 7pm on August 25, 2008. When the show was over we walked back to the truck. As I was throwing bits of ice on him something in the sky caught my eye, and at first I thought it was a shooting star so I glanced away for a second and when I looked back up I noticed that there were 4 dim lit lights on the underneath on what looked like a triangular craft. And the craft, which was completely black, had a fine silver line that looked to be the far edge of the wing. So I thought to myself that this would be some sort of an airplane but I noticed that there was no sound and no flashing blue/red lights. It was completely silent. My dad also asked about the space station or it being a satellite or something. No, it wasn’t because I noticed that as it passed by it covered up the stars as it was moving.  It didn’t seem to be that high like a plan either, I mean, it wasn’t touching the tops of trees or anything. So about a few seconds when I realized what I may be seeing I slapped my boyfriend on the shoulder and pointed to the sky. He saw the last 3 or 4 seconds of it but then as it got farther away it was gone.;32.2058272727272;-95.8097454545455
