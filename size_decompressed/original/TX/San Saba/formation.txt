Strange group of 10 black ufos videotaped in broad daylight doing impoossible manuevers;2003-05-04 13:00:00;10 seconds;Strange group of 10 black ufos videotaped in broad daylight doing impoossible manuevers Hi, we have been leaving our camera on trying to videotape *RODS* but we managed to capture something else that is stranger than the rods.  A group of 10 black ufos flew by and one of then (tagged) if you will another black ufo and it swooped up really crazy real fast.  IT was all caught on hi-8 format video with a tripod and its very clear with no shakyness and or digital zooming.  IT happened at 2:40pm in san saba tx USA. ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the video, and at first blush, the objects appear to be dark colored birds.  However, one of the lead birds performs a sudden movement, and then stops, in a manner which we believe is uncharacteristic of birds' flight.  We suspect the objects are birds, but we have no explanation for the strange, sudden movement of the one element of the formation.  PD));31.1633;-98.7304
