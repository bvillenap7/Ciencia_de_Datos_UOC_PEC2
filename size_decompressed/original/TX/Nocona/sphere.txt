I saw, at midnight, a very dim ball of light.  I call it a ball because it appeared to be a small round object way up in the sky.  It was very dark on this Halloween night, and the sky appeared to be clear as all of the stars were shining.  This small round object glowed very dimly I could barely see it.  It moved from the north to the south, from horizon to horizon in about 12 seconds, approximately.  I lost sight of the object behind the roof line of my home as it continued south.  This is the first unusual  thing that I have ever seen.  I am 45 years old and I have a BA and a MS degree from TCU in Fort Worth Texas.;33.8005;-97.7245
