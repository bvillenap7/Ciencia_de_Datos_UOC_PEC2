Bright ball going east to west.;2008-04-26 20:00:00;5 seconds;Bright ball going east to west. I was in a KOA campground, sitting and looking at the sky. There was a high, thin cloud cover so the stars weren't visible. I'm not sure what phase the moon was in but it wasn't really pitch dark. I'm guessing it was shortly after sunset, which I think was 2000 hours on that day. I saw a large object fly over roughly east to west. It appeared to be above the cloud cover so it wasn't distinct, but appeared to be a large, bright ball about the size of a baseball held 4 or 5 feet above my head, if you get my drift. At first I thought it was a helicopter searchlight or something but it was silent. I don't live in Texas and was not used to the wide open spaces so I couldn't judge it's speed. It went toward the horizon and disappeared. Perhaps behind some thicker clouds, as it seemed to me at the time. I just discovered your site and I hope this adds to your database.;33.0674;-96.2350999999999
