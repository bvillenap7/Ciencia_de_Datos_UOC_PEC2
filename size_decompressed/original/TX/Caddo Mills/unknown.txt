Blue Green Flash burst seen raining down over July Texas sky at night.;2008-07-17 00:45:00;3 seconds;Blue Green Flash burst seen raining down over July Texas sky at night. I work the 2nd shift.  I was driving home when at approximately 12:45 AM I saw a flash in the sky and boom noise to my immediate left or northeast.  I was traveling along IH-30 eastbound around milemarker 87.  What I saw was a bluegreen flash and then it rained down in a burst as if a firework had exploded and was dropping to the ground.  My first reaction was that it was a firework maybe someone shooting off a late 4th of july shot.  But then I said to myself look how high that debree is falling from.  There was no firework ever shot that high up.  It appeared to come down somewhere to the west of Caddo Mills north of IH-30.  I had just dropped off my car pool buddy 2 miles prior to the event.  The next day at work I waited to see if he saw anything.  Sure enough he spoke 1st stating exactly what I saw, so I know it was no just seeing things.  I remember just watching the burst rain down, it was like straight down with little angle at all.;33.0674;-96.2350999999999
