The object slowed down and finally went level and light quickly dimmed, and object appeared to land We, my girlfriend and I, were sitting on my car at the Texas Ranger ballpark about 3a.m..  We both had summer jobs at the park and were saying goodnight after seeing a late movie.  The object looked like a cigar (saucer from a side view) and in July in Dallas there is a haze.  The light which was a bright green lit up the sky (in the general proximty, as it entered the area (trajectory-planet re-entry) perhaps even steeper than 45 degrees. I knew it was not a metorite, because I have been real close, <.5mi when I was a youngster, and had just finished 2/4hr. courses on astronomy.  Furthermore, as it neared the ground, it de-acclerated tremendously.  Gravity forbids (my understanding of physics) meteors from doing this. The green 'haze' quickly dimmed as the object slowed and leveled and shortly thereafter, continued its angle of decent, as it slowed it became faint and finally disappeared all together.  The proximty of the sighting was somewhat close to DFW airport, it was moving to fast and appeared and disappeared to quickly to be an aircraft. We chased, but really had no idea as to the actual distance of the object. I told my father about the sighting and he told me he had heard of several sighting the general area of DFW airport in that general time frame. The green light looking like a craft slowing down at high speed, and the light was a shield or barrier to protect the craft. One last detail we were looking west towards Dallas, but the Ballpark was along I-30 and well south of the airport. I did not know of anyway of reporting the incident before now, and unlikely the information will be of any use, but the story is very accurate.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159

Driving home from work I was trying to take some photos of the sunset and the clouds and after looking at the pictures I found something strange as it appears to be an unidentified flying object that was not visible in the sky when the picture was taken.   This was around 6:45 in the evening. There were NO Airplanes or HELICOPTER in sky at the time either.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
