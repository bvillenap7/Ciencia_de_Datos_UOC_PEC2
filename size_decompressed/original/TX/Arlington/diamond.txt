I've submitted this report twice already, and I don't know why it hasn't been filed with the rest of the updated ones.  It's not a hoax the intro. says 'obvious hoaxes have been ommited'.  Anyway, here it is again. About my junior year of high school, a few years back, I saw an object from my backyard.  It was dusk, and the sky was beginning to darken.  I looked up and saw a disk, apparently black, with a red light in the center.  There was no distortion at all this was a flying disk-shaped object.  It simply passed overhead, made no sound, and I never saw it again.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
