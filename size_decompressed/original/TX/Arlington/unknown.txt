Then one left heading south and the other stayed in place for about 10 minutes then flew slowly to the west. Objects were too far away to determine shape.  Looked like silver balls from the distance I was at.  What caught my attention was the flying they did.  The first one was going west then stopped, changed directions by about 90 degrees.  Then the second one came from the South and they circled each other for a few minutes.  Then one flew off back to the South and the other stayed in place for a few minutes then flew slowly to the west.  There were several aircraft from DFW airport in this same general area and if it was not my imagination then some of the pilots should have seen this.  They may not want to report it.  But if they do this should serve as an additional witness to the events.  I had to go back to work while the object was still visible.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
Very fast moving object, blinking blue, red, and green. In that pattern.;2001-03-21 03:21:00;15-25sec.;Very fast moving object, blinking blue, red, and green. In that pattern. I was just now outside getting a few items from the car. When i looked up, and there it was. Something that looked liked a shooting star, but it stopped. It traveled at amazing speed across the sky, and then just stopped!It flashed few colors: blue, red, and green. It didn't hold it's position but for a few seconds, then darted off with the same magnificant speed as when it came.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159

I steped outside and the sky for 2am in arlington looked as though their was an orange glow in the clouds passing over behind a cold front and it looked as if the clouds werent moving too fast and it was like something hiding beneath the clouds like a cloak and saw tiny streaks of light darting around like a laser pointer and too fast I believe for an earthly vehicle and too tiny to be lights on a jet plane from dfw and dfw airport is just up 360 N.  I believe it could of been a ufo.  The incident didn't last but maybe 45 minutes.  Kinda set my neck hairs on their staight ends.
