The objects came in from the West, until they were over the house across the street at which time they made a leisurely turn to the North. I was at 97.08872W 32.75318N at the time, in fact, I still reside there. The objects were not at all impressive, being a gull grey in color and making no strange aerobatics. WEATHER CONDITIONS: Heavy Cloud : YES Dusk : YES Warm : YES UFO ACTIONS: Disappear/Reappear: YES Noise Info : NONE I have a book by Robert Emenegger called UFOs, Past, Present and Future, and it has a sighting survey based upon the Observer's Data Sheet prepared for the USAF. I filled it out at the time and am using it to provide the data I'm entering here. I still remember it well, and will attempt to properly describe it in words, though my drawing from the time would be of better use. My mother and grandparents first called the objects to my attention. I went outside and was joined by my sister, her friend and my brother. We all saw them, and I had all but my grandparents sign the sighting report as witnesses. Now, however, they have nearly, if not totally, forgotten the episode. When I got outside, I saw the objects coming in over the roof of the house to our left, westwards. I live on a Circle, with the entrance on the east connecting to a north-south road. Our house is on the south-east corner facing the connecting road with the driveway leading to the entrance to the circle, where we were all standing. When I saw the objects, I rushed inside to get my binoculars only to find that my sister had broken them from when she had last borrowed them this is why the event is so prominent in my memory. I then got my telescope, a small thing from K-mart, maybe 50x, and dragged it outside. By the time I got back outside, the lead object was over the house across from our driveway, to the north, and had started its turn to the north. Now, to be honest, I would still swear that there were three of the things, but my notes from the time only indicate a single craft not in so many words, but Question #10 of the sighting survey asks if there was more than one phenomenon, and I had left it blank. Other parts of the form are blank as well, but simply those things that I did not have data on at the time and never had a chance to fill in, so perhaps I had missed the question or some other event caused me to not enter more than one object. At any rate, I believe I saw three of them and will assume so in this report. I trained my ! telescope on the lead object and managed to get a lengthy view until it was just too much of a hassle keeping it in focus and trained, so I just used the Mark-1 eyeball until they went out of sight to the north. I had 8 minutes of clear view, except for my trip inside for my binoculars and telescope, before they disappeared into some clouds. There was only one star out at the time, and the moon wasn’t up until 9:30pm. The only other traffic I saw was an airplane on the opposite sky when the objects were almost out of view. I live near D/FW Airport, but it had only just opened back then and it’s a good bit away. Besides, I know aircraft, and was a member of the Air Force JROTC at my high school. I can’t think of any aircraft that would take 8minutes to travel a mile, give or take. To describe them, I think the best thing to do is to think of a Dorito chip with very rounded corners. Now, take the chip and bend the rounded corners up to form a shallow bowl shape. Put a small raised hump on top of the chip in the center (only just visible past the edge) and a small circular light on the bottom in each corner and that’s pretty much it. The view I had was a three-quarter view from the bottom, so all I saw of the seeming hump was just what poked over the edge. The bottom was very round as were the edges. The object was an overall grey, and the lights were pretty much just white spots, they weren’t bright at all, in fact, they weren’t even visible until I used the telescope and remains of my binoculars. The objects didn’t give off any light or sound and made a very slow leisurely trip across the sky as I had said, nothing impressive at all. I still have the drawings of it, and can forward them in future if you so desire and I can get to a scanner. I reported the sighting to the police that same day, but I have no idea if they kept any record or anything. Well, that’s about it. I’ve tried to put down all I could think of and could find on that sighting survey, and I hope it helps. Feel free to contact me about it. Est. Height: 500 - 1000 feet Est. Speed: 5 - 10 MPH Est.

Triangular object with at least 5 round dim lights moving from West at very slow pace.;1975-06-23 21:00:00;1 minute;Triangular object with at least 5 round dim lights moving from West at very slow pace. I recently started looking through NUFORC.com in hopes of finding a similar sighting, which my father and I saw together. I was startled to find that someone had posted a sighting of the very object we saw and even stranger that the UFO was in the same town, on the same date, at the same time, and moving in the same direction - West to East.  We were just oustide my new home in Arlington, TX, when the object caught our attention. We both looked up and saw a rather large black trianglular object moving very slowy and seemingly very low, directly above us. The object was pitch black, against the night sky, with several large circular, but very dim, lights underneath. No other deatails could be made out and it seemed to glide accross the sky, in complete silence, and then it just dissappeared, soon after it passed overhead. The whole incident lasting only a minute.  The report I found of this sighting in NUFORC.com was seen from a different angle than myself, and the other viewer was able to see some more detail than I remember, however, I was able to see the lights underneath in more detail than what the other report describes. There were at least 5 perfectly round lights that were evenly dim, I was able to see them, but they did not give off any rays of light.  There is no stranger feeling in this world than experiencing a UFO, especially when it comes so close. It is gratifying to know someone else saw the same object. But even stranger it would be over 30 years before I would find that out.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159

When I read the book Comm;1984-04-05 21:30:00;4-5 minutes;I have a childhood memory of looking out front window, and seeing a glowing, pink house floating in the sky.  When I read the book Communion, I got chills at the mention of 'screen memories'. I have a memory from when I was about eight years old that has bugged me whole life.  It was before bedtime, and for some reason I was looking out the front window.  I was wide awake, and I did not have a fever that may cause hallucinations.  The way my memory retains it, I saw a large pink house floating in the sky.  It was glowing.  I recall passing out or something to that effect.  There are other memories, such as seeing a small man in my room at night...and I remember thinking it was 'E.T.'. I kept the memories in the back of my mind for years. I have other memories from high school, that inolve me lying in bed and having the strange feeling that the 'pink house' was coming back. I saw a movie called Communion during my freshman year, and was terrified of the image of the being.  This perplexes me, being someone who likes monster movies.  I just turned 21, and all of these memories have just started to come together.  I recently read the book Communion, and had a strange experience.  When I got to a part about what the author refers to as 'screen memories', a vision of the 'pink house' popped in my head and my entire body went ice cold.  I was paralyzed stunned.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159

large triangular ship moving slowly on it's path;2003-11-19 02:30:00;5 minutes;large triangular ship moving slowly on it's path Avery large triangular craft was going over my house. I went outside to just get some air. I looked up and it was just going over, blocked out the sky, large craft, several hundreds of yards in length and width. I felt a sence of mass above me, it was scary. It went south down HWY-287 and did a slow east turn about 10 miles from my location, at this time I saw a small (flame or illumination from the back). It went about ten miles to the east towards Cedar Hill and then turned South, it gained alttitude and very slowly disappeared. This craft was not fast, it was massive and deliberate it it's moves. No lights, no sound, no smell, but a feeling when it was over me of mass, if that makes any kinf of sence.  sorry about spelling this just happened and I an freaking out, sober, not a freak.

3 faded and/or dull lights (e.g. almost a cloaked effect) in the form of a triangle - moving at extremely high speeds from west-southwe;2006-04-12 22:15:00;30 seconds;3 faded and/or dull lights (e.g. almost a cloaked effect) in the form of a triangle - moving at extremely high speeds from west-southwest to east-northeast over the Dallas/Ft. Worth Metroplex at approx. 10:15pm central time.  The lights looked as though they were perimeter-like lights although I did not see any solide structure between them.  The lights were not flashing, amber in color, and absolutely no sound to the event.  I am positive it was not an airplane.  If you didn't catch it moving across your line of sight (e.g. star-gazing or in my case talking on the phone sitting in a lounge chair outside on my backyard deck) you probably would have missed it.  A once in a lifetime event...  Wow!;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159

I watched for 5-10mins before I went and retrieved my wife to witness these lights as well. We looked on for about 10mins together before I went in my frontyard and tried recording with my phone for another 10mins before it disappeared.

2 Hyper White Blue lights when roll move completed, discovered as a 3 light triangle object;2010-09-12 22:00:00;10 minutes;2 Hyper White Blue lights when roll move completed, discovered as a 3 light triangle object My first sighting was a few months which I reported a very bright blue light in the sky over Arlington moving in odd directions and followed by a helicopter.  My parents witnessed this with me and no explanation.   Well on Sunday night, the object returned, only this time, we were closer to the object.  I noticed it while at the bank, it appeared as 2 bright blue lights, a electric blue in which no other plane I have ever seen has had.   I called my wife who was around the corner getting yogurt, and then also saw the object. I took care of bank business as I watched the object move east and I thought it was going to disappear.  When I met with my wife a moment later, we clearly saw the object almost directly above us, and thought it was a helicopter until it completed a roll move and was clearly 3 bright blue lights in the shape of a triangle with red and white lights on the belly. In the few minutes seen, the object would roll back and forth showing the triangle s! hape, but then rolling back and appear as just 2 lights.  My wife, my mother in law, and I all stood in awe as we watched the object slowly lower itself as if about to land, I ran to grab a better camera as the shots and video taken on my iphone were unclear due to the night sky, to truly make out the triangle, but the color of the light was captured.  Before I could get back, my wife yelled that it had suddenly dropped at a high rate a speed behind our view.  There are softball fields where this would have landed, but upon driving to the area, the only thing I found were the end of the softball league games, and several police officers in the parking lot.  I assumed they were there for softball boozers, not space invaders.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
Low rumble revealed sparkling lights, resolved into dark Triangular craft with lighting at two leading edges.;2012-10-27 23:15:00;2 minutes;Low rumble revealed sparkling lights, resolved into dark Triangular craft with lighting at two leading edges. As I sat in my studio, I was beginning to get ready for bed.  I emptied my pockets onto my desk and thought that I should go out side before my shower.  As this was the second time in a few minutes that I had thought about going outside, I stopped what I was doing, lit a smoke,  and walked to the back door, opened it, and walked onto the patio.  I noticed that there was a distant rumbling sound that seemed loud, loud  enough that I wondered why I had not heard it inside my house.  The sound was much like the sound of a jet engine, without the usual high pitched whine.  Just the low frequency component of the sound like an Atlas rocket at a distance, or maybe a Harrier jet.  I am a professional audio engineer, and have very good hearing. I'll also point out that I grew up in the Land Surveying business, working many years in that field before my mid 20's.  Since the security lighting had activated when I went onto the patio, I reached my hand back inside the door and turned off the light to get a better look at the sky.  Still hearing the rumble, I looked up to see what it could be. Above me about 60 degrees above the horizon, and due west, I saw an odd haze that would sparkle light, mostly white, with red and blue green. My first thought was that it was too low to be an airplane, and that it did not appear to be moving fast enough for flight.  The sound was incorrect for it to be a helicopter.  The lights seemed to twist and turn, with no discernible shape.  As the sky was otherwise clear, this confused me.  I noticed that there was an occasional brighter flash in red and then blue green.  The object continued to morph, and as I watched, it solidified into a shape.  It became an equilateral triangle with one end pointed directly south.  The object seemed dangerously close to the ground and just hanging there. With my right hand outstretched to 30 inches, the object was about 9 -12 inches on each side, and about ½ to ¾ inches thick. The lights appeared along the perimeter of the two leading edges, with the brightest areas at the middle of each of those two edges.  I noticed that the southern most tip of the triangle had a soft white glow, and that the remainder of the bottom was a dull dark matt finish. The light area did not appear to be illuminated, only contrasted to the rest of the surface.   Much to my surprise, the bottom was not flat.  There appeared to be two large rectangular areas, one on each side of the center line, and while one was along the axis of (very slow) travel, the other was at 90 degrees to it.  The rectangular boxes had rounded edges.  I remember thinking, that this was not a good aerodynamic shape. Another incongruity. Once the position of the object stabilized, the lighted edges were barely visible from my perspective, but the occasional brightening of the nearest mid-side light was red.  I thought, maybe they were FAA lights, so I waited for the next flash.  The flashing did not have consistent timing.  The next time it was green, and still hazy in a digital sort of way.  Checking the far side lights, I realized that they were also inconsistently colored also..  It was more like the lights were displayed as camouflage, something that would appear correct to the casual observer. Wanting to take a photo, I realized that I did not have a camera on me, and that in order to get a photo I would have to get back into the studio, grab my phone off the desk and turn it on.  By this time, the object was already 45 degrees south of my position and I realized that I did not have time to get to the camera, and I decided to just continue watching.  The object continued south and within a few seconds had moved to the horizon, the sparkle growing ever smaller and less distinct. I have some surveillance cameras located around my house, and I later checked to footage.  I left the studio at 11:15 pm CDT to go outside, and the event lasted barely 2 minutes.  I saved the recordings from the system and looked at it later, hoping that some more information could come from it.  The studio camera has an audio channel, but the camera over the patio does not.  I could not detect any low frequency information from the sound track, as the noise floor on such systems is rather high.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159

Is not cloudy or just a few clouds and the moon and the stars are bright.   I quickly pull out my iphone to record it, but if you have an iphone you know is not great at night from a distance. It was awesome to see something like that.  I don't know what it was.  Maybe a new spy plane?  All I know it was huge.  I have the video I will d! o my best to post it.
