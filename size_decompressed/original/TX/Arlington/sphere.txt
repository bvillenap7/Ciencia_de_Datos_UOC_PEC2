6 white orbs going south to north in daylight sighting at high altitude.;2002-06-02 16:00:00;10 minutes?;6 white orbs going south to north in daylight sighting at high altitude. I and my best friend were at a water park in arlington Texas called Hurricane Harbor sitting in an upper c9overed deck looking out over the park. I was siting with the sun just barely occluded by the beam at the edge of the roof. I was looking at the water vapor rising up into the atmosphere ovewr the park. It was a clear sunny day aside from a lot of glare and haze. I had some fairly dark shades on (sunglasses) as did Charles. I was looking at the spot where the suns corona was flaring out from behind the beam and saw a white spot fly at a very rapid speed from south to north in a straight line it appeared to be at a higher elevation than all the jetliners in view and moved many times faster in apparent speed. I was sort of stunned but wasnt sure if i really saw what i saw, then a moment later another object on a similar trajectory moved from the apparent position of the sun across the sky from south to north. At this point my friend asked what was going on and i told him to sit in the same position with the sun occluded and tell me what if anything he sees. sure enough over the next few minutes we saw another four objects like the first two one of which was on a curved trajectory angling from south to a north west direction. The apparent size visually was the size of a BB held at arms length with a well defined shape the color appeared white. i want to point out that if we took off out shades the glare in the sky was such that it would have been impossible to see anything at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not specify the time of day of the sighting.  We will attempt to obtain that information.  Please see other report for similar sighting over Texas on same date.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) this is an addendum to my previous report entered on6/4/02 i neglected to include the time as you noted at the bottom of the report when posted. again the time was about 1600 hrs probably a bit later than earlier.

Videotaped on a roller coaster, noticed after waching video;2004-08-13 15:00:00;4 seconds;Videotaped on a roller coaster, noticed after waching video Seen on a on ride video of a rollercoaster at Six Flags over Texas.  The object was sphereical with a ring around it.  It was jet black and very slowly rose.  The object was first noticed while watching the video. It was only on the video for four seconds. The observers were on a trip and videotaped the ride.  They are 12, 10, and 8 years old.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
Large, very well lit sphere shaped object flying very low over my neighborhood then disappeared;2008-10-01 22:30:00;10 minutes;Large, very well lit sphere shaped object flying very low over my neighborhood then disappeared I was walking by the window in my living room and saw a bright lights in the shape of a sphere. The lights seem to be individual lights that lit up the entire thing in the front it had a flashing red light as well as on top and bottom too. It was only about 500 feet or less in the air over my neighborhood. There was no sound. It slowly moved behind a large tree in our backyard. I had enough time to wake up my husband and show him before it disappeared behind the tree. He thought it was a blimp but it was not shaped like one. There was no writing on it and there was not an area to fly the thing below it like a blimp has. It was lit up like a Christmas tree. The red lights blinked but the white lights remained constant. Very strange...;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159

6 bright orange objects in formation over Arlington TX. 10/22/13.;2013-10-22 21:51:00;3 minutes;6 bright orange objects in formation over Arlington TX. 10/22/13 October 22nd, 2013.  9:51pm to 9:54pm, local time. Clear sky normal air traffic around DFW for this time of day (roughly 30% chance of an air traffic within view), and normal number of stars. Atmospheric conditions allowed me to hear airplanes and cars as normal. Six objects in a loose formation of three pairs traveling at a constant height from SSE to ENE over Arlington TX.   Bright Orange/Red spheres, whose formation changed predictively in relation to my perspective as they flew by.  My view of this sky segment is 25% blocked by trees. Their size, apparent speed, and height reminded me of a formation of military helicopters, which most often travel down the I-30 corridor, as I see these several times a year, both day and night.  This flight appeared 2-3 miles South of I-30.  The two distinctions that differed these from a normal helicopter formation were a complete lack of noise, and their light output. These aircraft were silent, and luckily during my viewing there was no competing airplane noise.  To extrapolate their apparent size and speed to a distance where a normal helicopter could not be heard, would place them near the border of believability. The light output of these objects is, in my opinion, what sets them apart from anything in my experience.  They were not pin points, but were circular and by changing perspective, had volume.  Although orange/red, the brightness was only a little less than if a spotlight were pointed in my direction.  The intensity seen, varied only with distance, it was steady and uniform from all 6 objects.  They were too bright to make out helicopter rotors or tail booms. I have seen two fireballs in the sky in the past, one red, the other yellow green, both lasted around 10 seconds and I read about them the following day.  Last night the objects I saw lasted much longer.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
Large white orb with glow around it in south west Texas sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus?  PD));2013-12-03 19:00:00;~30-45 minutes;Large white orb with glow around it in south west Texas sky. As I was backing into my driveway I noticed what I thought was a seasonal planet that was just unusually close to Earth, it was very large, close to three times the size of the North Star for reference but with a glow around it as If it were in fog perhaps.  I blew it off until I walked outside a little later and it was gone.  It was very clear out which why I found the glow around it to be odd.  The light was fixed without any movement, round in shape and very white in color. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Peter,        When I saw the object in question I was facing south west, what's very curios about what I saw is the fact that my girlfriend of many years works for a major airline, one of my best friends is a professional pilot and I live near one of the largest airports in the word so I know what an approach light looks like. Good stuff!!!  Sent from my iPhone ((END ADDENDUM));32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
Black sphere about the size of a large air plane very slowly moving then as I pointe do it out it sped off very extremely fast.;2018-07-10 14:45:00;3 minutes;Black sphere about the size of a large air plane very slowly moving then as I pointe do it out it sped off very extremely fast. I witnessed a black sphere hovering and slowly moving in the distance high up in the sky and about 10 miles away.  As I told my friend to look at it, it was too far for my friend to see it his vision was not as good as mine.  It was dark clouds all over the sky.  The sphere was just below the high dark clouds.  Then it began to rain and thunder.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
Sphere in sky, looked like the sky was moving.;2018-09-30 02:00:00;10 seconds;Sphere in sky, looked like the sky was moving. Cousin and I saw a sphere shape moving in the sky, looked as if the sky was moving.  Looked as if it created a cloud.  There was no blinking lights, but it was easily seen if you looked.  It was in the sky for about 10-15 seconds.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
54 spheres appearing in a point in the sky and travelling north in a row.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-29 05:30:00;3-5 minutes;54 spheres appearing in a point in the sky and travelling north in a row I was leaving for work and as usual I spend a few minutes just looking at the sky before I get in the car. Movement caught my eye, it was what appeared to be 2 stars traveling one in front of the other in unison travelling towards the northeast. I banged on the kitchen window for my mom, she runs outside but wasn't able to catch sight of them before they moved past the tree line. As I'm still looking in that direction my mom starts looking elsewhere in the sky. I hear oh my God I turned and looked and there are 9 more sliding across the sky. I immediately though starlink but they were not travelling from horizon to horizon like you would expect, these mf'ers were appearing from a single point in the sky..blink on and move blink on and move etc we stood in the front yard and counted 54 spheres blink on and slide across the sky towards the north. I managed to snap pics, on one you can zoom in and see one.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
