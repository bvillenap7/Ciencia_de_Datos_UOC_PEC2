I walked outside.. looked up and saw what seemed like would be Stealth Bomber type airplane.. but the lights were very dim.. and the plane looked like it would have been huge. There were about 10 lights or so in what seemed like symmetrical pattern .. It was flying very slow.. and no noise was heard. After I lost it over the apartment roof.. I ran to watch it some more.. by the time I made it to other side of apartment building.. it had disappeared.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159

No blinking lights.  I've seen the space shuttle,satellites, falling stars,j ets, but never have i seen a craft fly like this one.
