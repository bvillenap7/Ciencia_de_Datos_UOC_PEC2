Bright orange ball that seemed to crash to the ground, making a loud, sharp noise the whole dark sky lit up in a deep blue color.;2001-08-10 22:00:00;15 seconds;Bright orange ball that seemed to crash to the ground, making a loud, sharp noise the whole dark sky lit up in a deep blue color. It looked like a bright orange ball, that seemed to crash to the ground, making a loud, sharp noise. The whole dark sky just lit up in a deep blue color for a second before fading. It was incredible. At first, I thought it might be some kind of bomb and ducked down. I drove around the area right after, but could not find anything unusual.  I think it was similar to the July 23, 2001, fireball witnessed by thousands of people from southeastern Ontario to northern Virginia that scientists believed to have been caused by a stony chunk of asteroid no larger than a suitcase, which exploded in the atmosphere 10 to 20 miles above the Earth's surface.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
A  distant explosive sound as the area around me turned deep blue  for a second and then I witnessed two bright lights in the sky.;2005-09-05 21:00:00;Around one minute;A  distant explosive sound as the area around me turned deep blue  for a second and then I witnessed two bright lights in the sky. I was in my backyard and night had fallen completely so it was very dark, yet I remember the moon was almost full. I was looking straight ahead of me, playing ball with my dog when I heard was sounded like a distant explosion and a second after I heard the sound, the ground and the area right above it turned to what looked like a deep, velvety blue. Something made me look up at the sky to the east where I saw the ending of an explosion of a giant ball of white/golden light. It faded entirely and then what remained a little off to the side of where the light had been was a vibrant, yet misty purple/blue/yellow haze which faded slowly and then disappeared completely, returning the sky to blackness. I likened the purplish haze to that of a nebula â€“ the colors, patterns and shape of the mist resembled photos of nebulae I have seen. Unfortunately, my mother was inside the house and I was the only one to witness the whole thing. I posted the story on a couple of UFO websites, hoping to find someone who had witnessed the event as well yet received no response. The entire event happened very quickly, but still after all this time, it still leaves me unsettled and baffled. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Bright orange seen in Texas.;2013-09-01 02:15:00;2 minutes;Bright orange seen in Texas. Started as what I thought was a shooting star as it was a on range, bright fireball heading towards earth. It then started back upwards the went straight ahead and never headed back in a downward motion.  I would not say I believe in UFO's but I know what I saw was unlike anything I have EVER seen.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
