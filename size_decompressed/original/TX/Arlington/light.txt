This is the first time I have ever seen such a sighting. I had gone outside to observe the stars for a while before going to bed, I was standing facing south and looking at the Orion Nebula, when something caught my eye coming over our house. Looking almost directly straight up and just slightly south, I observed a bright green light, the green was the same color as the green of a traffic light and about the same brightness. The size was about the same size as Venus looks in the night sky. The green object was traveling at a very high rate of speed. What looked like about four times the speed of aircraft passing over the same area. This object took about 12 seconds to go from almost straight up and about 10 degrees south to completely out of sight over some trees down the street looking north. When I first saw the green light I noticed that there was another object just like the first one also green in color, same brightness and also traveling the same direction and speed. This object was just to the right of the first object, and slightly behind it. I remember thinking, is this a low-flying aircraft? It sure is moving fast for an aircraft. Then I grabbed my binoculars to try to get a better look at the objects, When I viewed the leading object through the binoculars, I noticed that I could see the clouds behind the object and that there was no body or wings visible. The clouds were illuminated by the city lights, which made it a rather brightly lit evening, especially for 9:35PM. I could clearly see the clouds contrasted against the object as it moved under them. The clouds were patchy and scattered, and spread out evenly across the sky except for further north, where they were denser. You could also see many stars between the clouds. These objects did not look anything like stars, since they were moving at a high rate of speed. I also noticed that there was no solid object attached to these lights they seemed to be traveling by them selves. There was one aspect to this sighting that I thought was a bit strange, the objects seemed to be gaining speed rapidly, just prior to dropping down and disappearing behind the trees, which were about a quarter of a mile away. Early in my observation, when I first spotted the leading object looking through my binoculars, I noticed an orange much smaller light or object that seemed to be dancing very rapidly back and forth going past the green object in either direction, not a tight zigzag but a much more exaggerated movement, and quite rapid, more so than what would be expected for eye movement or movement of the binoculars. I could see the green object at the same time as the orange one and could tell that it was moving past the green one in a rapid movement. I was also able to pan the green object fairly easily allowing me to view the orange object as it danced around or back and forth by the green object. The orange object otherwise kept pace with the leading green object as it traversed the sky. There were no sparks, or tails visible and there were no flashing or strobe lights visible at any time on any of these objects. This whole episode caught me totally by surprise, as I had gone out to do some star gazing, not UFO gazing. I had not planned on looking for anything strange tonight. This has left me totally spooked and quite excited, definitely High Strangeness. This is the first time I have ever seen anything quite like this it truly made my night. What I have described above was not the planet Venus or Jupiter, or a star. I was able to see both planets during this sighting. It also was not an aircraft, balloon or a helicopter as there was no sound at all, emanating from this object., and it moved much too fast and smoothly.

Sllver-White stationairy light viewed through 10 x 50 hand held binoculars;2002-01-23 18:10:00;18:10 to 18:14;Sllver-White stationairy light viewed through 10 x 50 hand held binoculars Bright silver-white light was noticed in sky at an altitude of 45 degrees and azimuth of south south-east, relative to my position. Object was stationairy and appeared to be a bright pinpoint of non-flickering white light, like a street lamp or airplane landing light in the shape of a weather balloon. Looked like big white weather balloon. Sky was blue but slightly hazy, with a few high clouds. Object did not change position in sky, and I was able to observe it through 10 x 50 binoculars. Object looked like grayish-white sphere with black edge along bottom side. Object also appeared to be glowing from within and reflecting sunlight at the same time. Binoculars were hand held, and slight wind made still observation difficult. Object seemed to glow brighter as I observed in binoculars, and when I attempted to view the object without the binoculars, I lost it and could not find it again. The time was now about four minutes later. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) Peter, I also sent you another report on almost the same phenomena, but observed on a different date. And that time I was ready for it with a pair of binoculars.  The first sighting was on february 16, 2002 at 5:50 to 5:52 pm. The second one was on July 23, 2002 at about the same place in the sky at 6:10 to 6:14 pm.  I am an amateur astonomer and I own an 8in Celstron. I am accustomed to seeing space craft in orbit (ISS, SS, etc.) and even have seen the atmospheric abberation shock wave of a re-entering vehicle.   All of those things follow the physical laws of orbital mechanics. These lights that I saw, did not. Even if they were naked eye, and even if one was pretty shakey through a pair of 10 X 50 binonculars, they must fit into the category of unexplained and unidentified, at this point.  I really thought that they were genuine weather balloons with a radiosone attached, and that still could be the explaination, but at this point, I am confounded. So I figured it would be appropriate to put it into the database.  ((END));32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
Silver-White stationairy ball that gradually got smaller in size, and dissppeared.;2002-02-16 17:50:00;17:50 to 17:52;Silver-White stationairy ball that gradually got smaller in size, and dissppeared. Silver-White Ball. Spherical. Like a giant siver balloon, reflecting silver-white light reflex. I happened to look up into the south east sky at a passenger jet that had just taken off from DFW airport, that was traveling south west and that was turning further west. As I was watching the jet, the bright silver light caught my attention because of it's proximity to the jet. I thought it was a small plane and that the jet might crash into it. As I watched, the jet passed in front of it, occluding it just like one object passing in front of another one. My attention was focused entirely on the silver-white ball object that the jet passed in front of (from my perspective) at that point. Over the next two minutes, as I watched, the silver-white ball got smaller and smaller, as if it was receding in distance away from me, and it got dimmer and dimmer, and started to turn a soft shade of blue white, the same way the moon appears when seen in the sky during full daylight. It gradually got smaller and then dissapperared entirely, never changing altitude or azimuth in its relative position to my position on the ground, and then just dissappeard when it got too dim to see any longer. This was in the afternoon in full daylight, the sun was about fifteen to twenty degrees above the horizon in the opposite part of the sky. No clouds. Air traffic from DFW was clearly visible for approximately fifteen miles in all directions.

Bright Red lights hovering and then falling to the ground one by one;2003-09-03 23:30:00;45 sec-1 min.;Bright Red lights hovering and then falling to the ground one by one My husband and I were outside, and I looked up in the sky as I always do.  We were talking and we both stopped and said Oh my Gosh! We couldn't believe what we were seeing!! There was two incredibly bright red lights coming from the north and what stopped us in our conversation was that first they were incredibly bright and red and they were flying too weirdly together... At first they flew side by side and then they just kind of stopped.  One kind of back-tracked a bit and that's when I really couldn't believe what I was seeing! One of the bright red lights just kind of lowered and then fell straight down.  Then the other seemed to stay there for a second and then it also fell straight down.. We couldn't believe what we were seeing.. I didn't want to move 'cause I tought I would miss something and we were afraid that if we went inside to go and get a camera or binoculars or anything to see it closer that we would miss something. But it was over before either of us could do anything.. He went back inside and I was facinated by what I had saw. I have never in my life seen anything like this before and neither has he... I heard sirens later and we saw smoke.. So we went to investigate.. It was near I-20 and it was a trailer house that was totally engulfed in flames.  It was right about where we saw the lights go down.. It was around 12:45 am and there was over 5 fire trucks trying to put out the fire.  I drove by it today and it was rubbles.. I figure if it was from the lights, that maybe there would have been an investigation? I know if we saw them someone else had to of seen the lights too.. Anyhow.. It was an amazing experience and I will never forget it.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
((NUFORC Note:  Intl. Space Station.

At 10:10pm tonite I was outside in my backyard with my dog and I began Star gazing . My house faces to the West and my backyard faces East. I was on the NorthWest side of my house Star gazing when I saw a Star like object flying at a slow speed coming from the NorthWest.  I first thought it was a airplane or helicopter because there is a Airfield located NorthEast of where I stay but, the closer it came I could hear no type of sound by it .  But what baffled me even more was before it could pass over my home the Object's lights started getting dim until there was no light nor Object at all . It totally and completely vanished .  Being an ex-Naval Airman I know for a fact that No Aircraft would turnout all of their lights for it would be very very dangerous and against FAA rules and Regs . I kept looking for about 5 min. trying to see if it would light up again but , there was no light , object , nor sound . I hope someone else will report this sighting as well . It was not a meteorite nor a falling Star . It was flying at a flat and straight angle and stayed at the same altitude when it vanished.

The object appears stationary very close, moving from one place to enother,then stops and disappears. ((Sighting of Mars??  PD));2005-11-02 19:00:00;4 hours;The object appears stationary very close, moving from one place to enother,then stops and disappears. I have been observing this object for over 1 1/2 weeks now. The first time I noticed it was Saturday, October 23. I thought it was a star, but after observing it a long time, I knew that it was too bright, too big, and too close to the earth to be a star.  It did not move.  At that time, we had a full moon.  I noticed as the moon changed location, this object did not.  It appears every night at the same location and sometimes moves very slowly and other times stays stationary.  Last night, I got the best look of it of all.  I even had my neighbor come out and look at it with me. This object was very very close to us.  As we watched, two other objects appeared and the larger one began to flash red lights as the two smaller ones seems to come closer to the larger one.  I live at XXXX Drive, Arlington, Texas 76018. From my tracking, the object appears first at 7:30 p.m. on the left side of my house and moves to the right side of my house as 10:00 p.m. approaches.  I even called the airport to see if the government was conducting some sort of aircraft exercise.  They knew nothing of such tests. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she seemed quite sincere in her belief that she had witnessed something unusual.  However, based on he description above, we believe that she probably was observing the planet Mars.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was facing s.w. and saw a very bright white light approaching from the s.w. heading n.e.. Thought it was an aiplane on approach. As it got closer I noticed the light was intense and completely surrounded the plane. It went over my head at about 1000 feet and made no sound at all. I still was thinking it was a plane until it passed and the bright light totally surrounded the object. No wings noticed. No red and green lights. speed was about 150 mph.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159

The fastest falling metour without a tail that was no common airplane!;2007-10-25 19:15:00;10-15 seconds;The fastest falling metour without a tail that was no common airplane! At approximatly 7:15 pm, Thursday, Oct. 25th, I was driving in an easterly direction, in Arlington, Texas.  More specific, I had just turned left onto Rosewood lane from Collins street. The sky was at dusk, still with a lot of blue, and a mostly full moon was staring me in the face.  All of a sudden, a bright star-like object, (much brighter than Venus), appeared at the top of my windshield, falling hard and moving fast toward the horizon. I can assure you it was no airplane, for, to be honest, I'm smarter than that.  I know when I see an airplane, and THIS was no airplane!  This unidentified falling object moved too fast and the light did not twinkle, or blink.  It traveled from the top of my windshield to the horizon in a matter of 10 seconds, or so, keeping in mind I was on a residential street, not exceeding 15 miles per hour. My raw impression, is that whatever this thing was, IT came from the atmosphere and hit the ground.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159

It did not look like a commercial aircraft because it was only glowing white light as it headed east towards Dallas.  Then it shut off like a flash light would do, there we no other lights to indicate where is was in the sky.

I was checking out the moon when I noticed a flash - at first I thought it was a planes FAA collision lights blinking, but it only blinked once. As I contunued to watch the object travel towards the East I noticed it splitting into two objects. One object headed North and the other kept traveling towards the East. I was able to watch both objects for a couple of minutes until they disapeared into the night. The weather was clear and breezey with a slight haze covering the sky. The objects were identical - both round and reddish - moving fast and erratically.

Bright Electric Blue Light in Arlington Texas Moving Very Fast in a Short Distance;2010-06-19 21:55:00;10 minutes;Bright Electric Blue Light in Arlington Texas Moving Very Fast in a Short Distance A very bright electric blue light was seen just above the houses in South East Arlington. I noticed the light and advised my entire family to come out and observe as I noticed it was moving South slowly and was a color light I have never seen on an aircraft before.  As we watched, it started moving faster to the South, only to be amazed that a helicopter was following the blue light.  This struck fear as we continued to watch, when suddenly, the light shot back in the direction it was going, and immediately dropped below the house line. I ran into the house and grabbed my video camera.  The light returned and in a similar, but not exactly the same pattern, flew the same path running at very wild speeds. I was able to capture the light but due to how dark it was, kept having to zoom in and out to get a clear example of the brightness of the blue. It finally dropped again and was never seen again.  The sky was dark and very clear so this was by no means a spotligh! t as most of us were thinking.  I have the video but am not sure who to share it with for fear or rejection, but 5 of the most honest people I know watched this light move back and forth with no idea what it was we were watching.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159

On March 12, 2014, about 23:21 hours, I was standing outside my home, smoking a cigarette.   I looked to the West and just above my roof line I saw 3 stars in a line, (that I always see early in the night and to the west) but near the lowest star on the horizon out of these 3 stars, there was a small blue light.   I immediately focused in on it, because it was blue and it was moving.  I watched this blue light travel from (it almost looked like it was behind the star) the star to the left and at about a 40-45 degree angle towards the ground.   It traveled quickly for a few seconds, then it blinked out, and it was gone.  I thought I might have lost sight of it because of the tree branches that are in the way, but after getting a better view of that piece of sky, I could no longer see it.   I took out my iPhone 4S and took a picture of the sky where it was, but unless you turn up the brightness the image is almost all black.   This morning I remarked a copy of that p! icture, this morning.  I have used MSPaint to draw the path of the UFO, the tree branches, the roof line, and the brightest stars that were visible with the naked eye.  I will send the remarked picture and the original with this report.  Granted this was not a spectacular UFO sighting, but it was strange to me because I live in the flight path of a few airports, DFW International Airport, Love Field, Alliance Airport, and Arlington Municipal Airport.  So I am very familiar with Airplanes in the sky and the paths they take over my home, (it's usually from North to South) and this UFO was not taking a normal path that I see other Airplanes take.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
