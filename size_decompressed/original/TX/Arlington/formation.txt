A series of 10 lights moving across the sky in a straight line;1998-09-29 06:15:00;5 seconds;A series of 10 lights moving across the sky in a straight line I was standing on my balcony.  It was still dark.  I saw a large, straight line of about 10 lights moving quickly and soundlessly across the northern sky.  The formation formed a perfect horizontal line, and as it continued to move, the line of lights changed formation into a horseshoe shape and I lost sight of it as it passed behind my building. I heard absolutely no sound as this happened and the lights were yellow-white like a light bulb. I was not able to see if the lights were part of one object or independent of each other;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
