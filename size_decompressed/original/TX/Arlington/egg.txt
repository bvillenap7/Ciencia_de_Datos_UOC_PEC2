Dark object with glowing green-yellow light seen over Arlington, TX;2004-08-10 23:55:00;2 minutes;Dark object with glowing green-yellow light seen over Arlington, TX I just saw the weirdest thing I have seen since the big meteor a month or so ago. I live in Arlington in the Mansfield area. At about 11:55pm on August 10th,  me and a friend witnessed an object flying across the sky. It was unlike any aircraft I have ever seen. It was a dark oblong shape(the best I can tell). The large part looked like a shadow almost. It was colorless but slightly darker than the sky. It had a greenish yellow glowing object suspended just beneath the large object. I thought at first that it might be a balloon and glow stick, but the object was traveling against the wind at a steady rapid pace (opposite direction of cloud movement). It made no sound. It looked to be pretty large from what I could see of it. The object traveled from East to West and appeared to be at least 1000' feet up, or more, because it was above the lowest cloud line.  We watched it for a good while, until it disappeared in the distance. I would just like to know if any videotaped it, or if anyone knew what it was. IT WAS FREAKY, BUT VERY COOL.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
