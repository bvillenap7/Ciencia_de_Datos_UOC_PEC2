It made no sound, and moved with speed of the clouds...as if hiding? I was standing in my driveway, talking on a cordless phone to a buddy in Houston, BS-ing and having a smoke, and here we go again more odd flying objects in the sky.  I was facing the house, looking up at the more or less cloudy sky, when I spotted a weird light.  At first glance it appeared as another plane...or a star?  No, look again.  It was at a wierd altitude for a standard aircraft, and at a closer look, it sort of looked like two bright stars stuck together...but it was moving.  Object had no traditional aircraft lights,(i.e. blinkers, reds, blues), just plain white light.  What really perplexed me was the movement.  The object was gliding, moving along with the clouds same speed and same direction.  I know it sounds dimpy, but I got the feeling that it was trying to hide.  Craft made no noises.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
explanation of earlier report;2009-08-11 21:30:00;20 minutes;explanation of earlier report This is a follow up to a report I made earlier about loud booms, lights in the sky, and an unknown object being transported on a flatbed truck from a supposed crash site near Arlington,Tx. The object was a full scale model of an F-35 being transported to England from Lockheed in Fort Worth, with a military escort. The loud booms and lights in the sky were fireworks from a nearby racetrack in Kennedale, Tx. at 10:30pm to 12:30 am. It turns out the emergency vehicles in the parking lot of the supposed crash were part of a candlelight vigil for a skateboarder killed the night before on the access road of I-20 at that location. The two incidents were separated by 3 hours, and the military convoy just happened to pass by at the time of the vigil, around 9:30 pm, and there were entrance ramps to the freeway at that location blocked for the passing of the oversized load.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
Tall skinny alien spotted years back crossing a regular neighborhood in the suburbs at night. Why??;2012-05-10 22:00:00;10 seconds;Tall skinny alien spotted years back crossing a regular neighborhood in the suburbs at night. Why?? Although this happened a few years back, I am curious to know if anyone has seen the same thing I did. Driving down a regular, pretty nice, suburban street at night in Arlington, me and my bestfriend we’re headed towards the end of a street where you could either go left or right when you got the the stop sign.  You can not go straight.  (We needed to go left). As we were coming down the same street we always did, a 8 ft tall “thing” walked across the street, at the stop sign of the neighborhood which we were driving towards.  It was similar shaped to a human, but way taller and way skinnier, overall tall and lanky to the point where there was no mistaking the fact that it was not human.  It’s head was slimmer than a human too, clearly not as big as a human head would be to a body of this size.  The arms went further down then a humans would.  It walked across the street like it was somewhat in a hurry. My heart dropped instantly and I couldn’t really even say anything.  I could not believe what I know I had for sure seen just casually, somewhat in a rush, cross the street. My bestfriend spoke about 2seconds after it happened, (she was driving the car) and said, “did you just see that”  I said “YES” she replied, “well tell me what you saw so I know you’re not lying.” “It was y’all and skinny”.  She started laughing and continued driving down the street as I yelled at her to stop because I thought it would jump on the car or something like a horror movie. Instead, it must have his because it was nowhere in sight.  But if I were it in a human world, I would probably hide too. There is one video on YouTube of an alien on a roof top in Mexico in 2015. That is the only pic/video I have found of EXACTLY the thing that I saw.  I know that video is real, because I saw that thing with my own eyes.  I think he is stuck on Earth, maybe that’s why it took him 3 yrs to end up on a roof top in Mexico because he is having to walk around at night to try to stay out of sight somewhat.  Not really sure.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
