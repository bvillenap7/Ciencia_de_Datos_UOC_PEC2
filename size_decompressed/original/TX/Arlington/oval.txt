Enormous UFO Arlington, Texas;1993-12-01 14:00:00;5 to 10 minutes;Enormous UFO Arlington, Texas Although I have given the date of my sighting as December of 1993, I am unsure of the exact date.  I was driving East on Arkansas Lane in Arlington Texas in early afternoon.  As I topped the hill and approached the intersection of Park Springs and Arkansas Lane I saw an enormous oval shaped disk that appeared to be made of highly polished silver, hovering over the City of Grand Prairie, Texas, which is the City to East of Arlington and about 10 miles from the intersection I was approaching.  It seemed to me to be about the width of a football field or two and was much larger on the horizon than the Dalworthington Gardens Water tower that came into view as I approached the next traffic light at the corner of Spanish Trail and Arkansas Lane.  The strange thing about this sighting is that the UFO appeared to be appearing and disappearing as it sort of wobbled while sitting there in the sky.  Although I did not see any airliners at that time, The UFO seemed to be sitting well above the trees that were visible to me and just under a landing flight path to DFW Airport that I generally always see a plane or two making a final approach when I travel East on Arkansas Lane.  Sometime before this sighting, I remember hearing about some one or some group trying to project a picture of Christ in the skyline above New York City and at first I thought that because the UFO was appearing and disappearing that perhaps that was happening here also.  However, this was in broad daylight.  I looked to my left, intending to honk at the white pick up truck to my left and call the driver's attention to what ever this was.  However when I looked at the driver, I could see that the gentleman driving the truck had his mouth open and was looking at the same sight I was seeing.  I continued down Arkinsas Lane and the UFO continued to hover and appear and disappear until I reached the intersection of Bowen Rd. and Arkansas Lane.  Then the UFO disappeared and never appeared again.  The next day, I was again in my car listening to either the local Classical or Oldies but Goodies Radio station, when the announcer made the following addition to a short news break, All you people in Arlington, who called in to report what you thought was a UFO yesterday were actually seeing a weather baloon.  I was not one of those people who called in, but I do know that what I saw was no weather baloon.  At the time of my sighting, I did not have a computer.  Two years later when I did purchase one, I began a search that continues today for someone, anyone who saw this same UFO  I am unsure of the date and even the exact year, but I know that others must have seen it and either called the authorities or a radio a station to report it.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
White oval (weather balloon?) over The Ballpark;2007-03-31 19:00:00;3 Mins;White oval (weather balloon?) over The Ballpark While watching the Rangers game, a white object was observed over The Ballpark (Texas Rangers)that was likely a weather balloon.  It appeared to be relatively high as DFW Airport had a take-off pattern to the east of the stadium and the planes were lower then the object.  It drifted toward the northeast (possibly upword), did not appear to have flashing or constant lights, and faded toward the northeast.  I took a few pictures, but the object was very blurry (can submit if requested).  We were just wondering if anyone else saw the object.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
Large oval object hovering over major Texas city;2008-08-18 09:20:00;approx.20min;Large oval object hovering over major Texas city I was sitting at my desk talking on the phone, and I looked up out the window.  I saw a grayish oval object hovering above the trees.  I watched it go down behind the tree line and then rise again several times.  I took pictures of it with my cell phone, but the object was too far away.  I tried to enlarge them, but the object is just blurred out. I am in a 3 story building and the object was about the same height, maybe a bit higher.  I could also swear that it seemed to be changing shape.  Started out pretty big, appeared to decrease in size, flatten out, and even looked to change into a diamond shape sort of.  If I had to guess, I would say it was about 20 miles away.  I am at work, so I had to do an xray.  When I came back it was gone and has not returned since.  I had one of my skeptical work mates look at it, and all she could say was that it had to be tethered to something.  It was raining here this morning with a slight breeze.  If it was a balloon, it was pretty big and grayish, not your typical bright balloon that you would associate with a promotion of some sort.  I really don't know what this was, but I felt compelled to report it.  Thank You;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
White glowing object with fire coming out of it.;2013-02-26 19:15:00;10 minutes;White glowing object with fire coming out of it. February 26, 2013 around 7:15 pm, I was getting out of my car about to go in the house when suddenly I noticed a very bright white glowing object that looked like a glass bubble with fire coming out of the bottom end of it floating down from the sky.   It appeared to want to land on top of the roof and I said, Oh, no it is going to set the roof on fire. So I began to take some pictures and call 911 as I did that, it suddenly started going back up a little faster than it was coming down.   As it was going back up it burned itself out and became a round circle with an inner ring that was glowing very brightly as it ascended.   I then noticed three low flying planes headed in the same direction as the object went suddenly up.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
Bright object shots up and disappears into space.;2016-03-31 22:02:00;2 minutes;Bright object shots up and disappears into space. I work between Arlington, Texas, and Euless, Texas @ Collins street or TX157.  For the past month I've noticed an oval shape craft fly in the same direction (south) and slowly shoot up into the sky and disappear.   I've have noticed that it usually appears flying somewhat erratically and bright. It's as bright a the planet Jupiter.  I can actually see it go up into the upper atmosphere and disappear. It's cool.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
