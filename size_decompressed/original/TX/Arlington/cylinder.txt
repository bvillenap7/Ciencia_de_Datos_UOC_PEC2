I observed the object for around 10 min, it didn't appear to move but it was really hard to tell at that time. I was in my way to a grocery store when I spotted the object in the sky. The object does appear to be moving at a very slow rate. I arrived home and pulled out my binoculars, I found the object and was able to gather more of a detailed picture. The object appeared to have a goldish,bright light emitting from it and a haze surrounding it. The object appeared to be very large, and just above the clouds. At times it looked liked two lights moving in a slow rotation, never completeing a full turn. When I first noticed the object it looked cylinder in shape, after 30 or so minutes, It changed to a circle like shape. I live around 10-15 miles from DFW and the object appears to be hoovering in that general direction. I'm not sure if what I observed was a weather ballon, I doubt that though. I've lived near the airport for nearly 7 years and I've never seen a weather ballon in that area before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
