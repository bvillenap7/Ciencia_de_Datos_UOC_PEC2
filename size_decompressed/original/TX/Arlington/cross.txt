Cross-shaped ufo with white and red blinking bright lights that hovered over Arlington, Tx, near the ground.;2013-11-09 00:00:00;5 minutes;A cross shaped ufo with white and red blinking bright lights that hovered over Arlington, Tx near the ground I was sitting in the car with a friend then all of a sudden we notice something very big a that was very low to the ground.  It was flying so low to the ground we thought it was going to crash and it was comin towards us then all of sudden it begin turning it was infront of us turning but it did not make a sound.  Underneath it were white lights goin horizontal and red lights going vertical.  We knew it was no plane and we were AMAZED so we got out the car and watched it float off as the lights kept blinking.  It turned so sharp and made no noise and was certainly not shaped like a plane.  We tried to get in the car and follow it but it seemed to disappear in the sky, it was very weird and all we could do was smile and talk about it.  I have never come in counter of a ufo but I am most certain that was a UFO!  What is so strange is that after we went back to where we seen the ufo and parked rhe car strange things begin to happen.  There was no wind at all and the gate by us begin to open and and would close but there was none there.  Then it would open slowly and close half way the open again and when we looked no one was there but there was a cat that stopped and stirred for a long time at the gate.  It was very weird so we both went home.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
