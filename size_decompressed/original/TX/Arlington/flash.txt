lights in the sky and time lapse;2008-05-11 00:14:00;seemed like just a couple;lights in the sky and time lapse   i was driving home from work late saturday night (early am sunday), when i turned right by the park across the street from my apartment, i saw a huge flash in the sky with no lightning. What I did see was sort of a small circle (the size of a pencil eraser in the sky) glowing bright white light and shooting diagonally and silently toward the earth. When I turned the corner a couple of blocks away I had glanced at the clock on my radio and it read 12:14, when i arrived home and sat on the couch it was closer to 12:34 or 44 I can't remember but it seemed very odd to me.;32.6993445756464;-97.123005867159
