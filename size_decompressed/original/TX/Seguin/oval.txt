I like to observe the occasional passing of satellites,  shooting stars and  night sky.  I live about 7 miles south east of Seguin, Texas a little out in the country in a small subdivision.  I saw at least two different satellites overhead going in different directions and one brief shooting star.   I was facing South east towards Gonzales, Texas when I noticed low in the horizon barely over the tops of several mesquite trees in my front yard, SE corner, a shooting tail of light and then suddenly whatever was causing the light trail, tilted on its side and I could plainly make the object out that was making the light trail.  When it tilted there was no more trailing light from the object,  Upon tilting the object was a large glowing disc shaped object.  To be that large, it was probably a beam ship or mother ship (factoring the distance which could only be guessed at and the size of the disc).  Immediately after tilting on its side, it dematerialized or went to faster than the eye could see or something because after tilting and being clearly visiable as a disc on its side (glowing top or bottom towards me), it disappeared.  Again when it disappeared there was no light trail either.;29.5593000000003;-97.9631000000007
