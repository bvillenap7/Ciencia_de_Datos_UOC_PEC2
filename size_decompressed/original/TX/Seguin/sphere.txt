Orange color changing sphere near cell phone/radio relay tower.;2006-05-20 01:45:00;30 minutes;Orange color changing sphere near cell phone/radio relay tower. I was driving home to our place outside of Seguin After working in the emergency room. When I drove over the last small hill on the road, an orange spherical object came into my view hovering near the cell phone tower/radio tower near the intersection of Good Luck Rd/Rangeland.   I pulled my vehicle over to observe the object.  It was almost surreal to see it change from a very amber color, to a burnt orange, to almost the color of a daylight fluorescent bulb.   I tried to call and wake up my mom to come see it but was unable to get her on the phone.  I didn't feel threatened in any way, just felt like my eyes must be deceiving me initially.   After observing for close to thirty minutes, I drove on home to go to bed.  The object remained stationary even as I left.
