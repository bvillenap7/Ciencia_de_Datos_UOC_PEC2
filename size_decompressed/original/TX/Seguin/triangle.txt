black triangle hovering near auxillary airfield in seguin texas;2011-08-14 21:15:00;3 minutes;black triangle hovering near auxillary airfield in seguin texas As we (my 7year old son and I) were Eastbound on Hiway 90A East 2 miles east of seguin and as we were passing the Randolph Auxillary airfield my son noticed 3 lights suspended in the north. They appeared to be within 1 to 2 miles distance.   I slowed down and rolled the driver side window down. Then the one in the middle got really right. REALLY bright and then started to travel south east as if to intercept us as we were headed due east. As the craft neared us, it had 3 solid white lights in a triangle form and was solid black. We stopped on the shoulder of the road observe it longer and as it passed over us, it was no more than a few hundred feet up..and dead silent.  A mini-van pulled over going the opposite direction and asked us if we needed help and i replied, No ma'am, we are just watching this craft. and i pointed at it. She asked, what is it?  I told her, its unidentified. Its moving WAY too slow to be 'airborne' by means of lift. She responded, I! ts probably those iraqis.  Jeez are people that lost in whats really going on these days?  Anyway, this is the third time I have seen something like this over here in the past 2 months and I figured I should go ahead and report it. I did not have a camera but I tried to take pictures and video with my phone but no matter what settings I could set it, I could not get it on the screen.  I called my sons moms where we had just left from to see if she would go outside and check it out and as soon as I hit send on the phone, it shot directly south at a high rate of speed.;29.5593000000003;-97.9631000000007

It was moving at a steady speed but after it would disappear it would reappear in a completely different location offset from its original course.  It seemed as if an airplane was attempting to follow it.;29.5593000000003;-97.9631000000007
