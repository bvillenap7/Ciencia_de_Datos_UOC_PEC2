I live in Olmos, TX about 8 miles South of Seguin, TX. from 01/18/09 to present date, I can see what looks like a star in the sky directly south of my location.  I noticed it one night while smoking a cigarette at about 1am, I came back at 3am and it was gone, it has been in different spots, but same direction in the sky, nearly every night that the sky has been clear.  The thing that caught my eye was it appeared to be strobing different colors.  I looked at it with my binoculars and it was strobing green, blue, red and purple.  I have never believed in UFOS, but, I just cant explain what this is.  It doesn't move, so its not aircraft or satellite, it is to high to be a new radio tower.  My background includes 5 years as a Bexar County Sheriffs Deputy, 2 years as a private investigator.  I have an Associates Degree in Criminal Justice and I am currently a student at the University of Texas.  If you were to look at Seguin on the Texas map, the thing I am seeing is in! the direction of La Vernia, TX, which is in Wilson County.;29.5593000000003;-97.9631000000007
