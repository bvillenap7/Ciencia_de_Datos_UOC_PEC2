Long, cone-shaped, object with white, red and green lights seen by 2 people.;2016-10-30 19:46:00;15 minutes;Long, cone-shaped, object with white, red and green lights seen by 2 people. I went outside in my back yard and noticed a large, brighter than normal star that was not moving, through the trees.  As I looked closer I saw it had white, red and green lights.When I measured with my arm out in front of me, it was about 45 degrees above horizon.  I have a porch light, but the yard is large and at the back of the yard it is very dark.  Because of the trees blocking my view, I went into the street in front of my house and saw it was cone/triangular in shape but very long and narrow.  I started trying to take a picture of it because my and my neighbor's porch lights were both off but, because a camera on a phone is not good quality, all I got was a larger than normal white light. My neighbor joined me in the street, and I asked him what he saw.  He said I don't know, that isn't normal.  I asked him if he saw red, white and green colored lights and he said Yes.  There was also a small aircraft with 2 blue lights flying by that was easily identified as an airplane. I went back out at 20:19pm, stood in the same place in the street, and it is gone. I saw another craft in June. I put a short video on Youtube titled Star Gazing Over Texas.;29.5593000000003;-97.9631000000007
