It Was A Straight Line With White Lights Not Flashing. Like A Flying Train. From My View, It Came From Northwest To SouthEast Diagonally. As It Passed My Location, 15 Seconds Later It Was As If The Lights Slowly Dimmed Away And I No Longer Seen It. And Of Course As I Was Getting My Phone To Take A Picture Or Video, My Device Decided To Act Up So It Was Impossible.  Minutes Later,From That Point, Right Above Me, I Noticed Two Stars From Which I Thought They Were, First One (Big)Came From NorthEast To SouthWest Out Of Nowhere Just Appeared And Moved, Then Two Seconds Later The Second One(Small) Came From SouthWest To NorthEast And As Both Came In Contact Above Me, The Big One Dissapeared Once They Crossed Eachother, Then 4 Sevonds Later The  Smaller One Dissappear! s..Now If Its Military, Why Not Let It Be Known To Not Get It Confused With A Actual UFO. Or If It Was Mufon Why Not Let Its Citizens Know They Were Performing. I Dont Know, Whatever It Was, It Was Not The Usual Plane Or Helicopter. Its An Odd Shaped Craft No Noise Whatsoever...;29.5593000000003;-97.9631000000007
