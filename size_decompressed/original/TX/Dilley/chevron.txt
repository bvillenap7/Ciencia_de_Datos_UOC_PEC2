For 2 seconds I watched it block out some stars with the naked eye.  Pulling my monocular to my eye it was a V shape made of light grey disks, 7 on the left and 5 on the right.  It definitely was not birds, as I could see these perfectly round metallic disks.  My first view was at 90Â°, observed with monocular for 3-4 more sends until it disappeared over a 10 foot tall shed to my South 45 feet away.  The object never seemed to get smaller in my range of view.;28.6814;-99.172
