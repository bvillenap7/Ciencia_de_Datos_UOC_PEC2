Shortly after moving into our new home we noticed, while moving around inside our home, my wife and I would catch a glimpse from the corner of our eyes, outside the picture window a bright flash of light, coming from the back yard.We asked each other,did you see that? wondering what it was, it only lasted for a second. This happened for approximately eight days,and always in the evening beginning around 9:00PM.This would happen only once a night (that we knew of) and not every night.The light was so bright it would light up the entire picture window like day light, in a flash we would turn our heads to look and it was gone. One night(within the eight day period)I was sitting out on our pool deck,it was about 12 midnight,when this circular object rose above the horizon about 30 degrees, without any noise it approached very slowly above my head about 11:00, a             (70 degree angle)when it stopped and hovered.It looked like the full moon only half the size, no glow just a yellow/white circle. I watched it as it appeared to stay still watching me. Before my eyes this thing exploded without any noise, concentric rings of light blasted away from this circle lighting up thr entire back yard. It was so bright you could see the veins in the tree leaves. In less then a second out from the center of this object a missile shaped object shot out and moved at an extremely high rate of speed away on a near 80 degree angle up into the stars, about five seconds it was among the stars still moving as it vanished out of sight.
