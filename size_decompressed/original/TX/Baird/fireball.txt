It;2000-10-13 19:30:00;30 sec. to 1 min.;I am a 34 year old attorney with two children.  My wife and I were traveling from Dallas to Abilene, heading West on Interstate 20.  It was near sunset (right at 7:30 p.m.) and my wife said What's that!  I looked up and saw a green colored light moving across the sky.  A vapor trail followed it, but it was much larger than a vapor trail left by an airplane.  A bright light, appearing to be fire, followed the bright green light and led to the vapor trail.  The light traveled from directly in front of our windshield from right to left (North/North East).  When it was not too far from the horizon, it looked as if it split into three or four smaller green lights and then disappeared. The same description was also seen by relatives traveling from Houston who were meeting us in Abilene that same day.;32.3877;-99.3764
