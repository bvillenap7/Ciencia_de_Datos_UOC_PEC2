My husband and I were heading East on Interstate 20 in between Baird and Putnam in West Texas.   My husband first saw 3 orangish lights appear one after the other in a row in the Southern skies.  They appeared one, two, three then faded out one, two, three.  They were approximately 45 to 65 degrees above the horizon but seemed rather close in proximity to the highway.   About 5 minutes went by, then they began to appear again, only this time there were four lights.  They slowly appeared one, two, three, four then faded out the same.  This time they seemed to be further away but were still appearing just South of us, even though we had still been driving.  It's like they were traveling east along side the interstate but only showed themselves a couple times that we saw.  We saw 2 planes right before we exited to the east in the same vicinity the lights had been.  We headed south on Highway 6 towards our destination and never saw them again.;32.3877;-99.3764
