4 lights in the sky;2011-07-28 21:20:00;30 seconds;4 lights in the sky My husband and I were on our way to a friends house when we noticed four lights in the sky.  They appeared to be moving slowly, so we got ready to take a picture.   As soon as we pointed our camera at it the 2 lights on the outer edges disappeared, and the 2 in the middle disappeared quickly after.   Moments later we saw what appeared to be 2 jets not too far from where we had seen the lights. o o o o <--- this is the pattern the lights were in, they were all part of one object. I didn't believe in aliens until last night.  We were driving on CR4698 in Boyd, Tx, heading West towards Highway 51.;33.0581;-97.5866
