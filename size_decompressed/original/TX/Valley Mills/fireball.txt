Fireball or meteor?;2002-03-06 03:30:00;5 seconds;Fireball or meteor? While delivering papers at approximately 3:30am, I observed what looked like a meteor falling in the northeast.  The object came straight down out of the sky burning for about five seconds.  The object was a white hot fireball and it reminded me of a decoy flare used by a jet fighter.  It didn't have a tail like a meteor, and it was a pure white color.  No orange or red color like you might see with a meteor.  The object burned-out approximately 15 degrees above the horizon.  I could not determine if the object was near or far from my position.;31.6594;-97.4965
