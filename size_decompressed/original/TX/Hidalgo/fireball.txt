Fireball flying over deep south Texas.;2004-09-05 22:10:00;15 seconds;Fireball flying over deep south Texas. While my husband and I were walking from our driveway to the front door of our house, we heard a loud cracking noise and looked up to see a huge fireball. The fireball was zooming across the sky very low (approx 5000 feet) from west to east, heading towards the Gulf of Mexico. The center of the object was a bright white with red flames sparking out behind it. The size of the object was similar to the size of a jumbo jet. My husband and I got a very clear view of the object since were we live is a rual area with no city lights or buildings.;26.0955;-98.2558
