White light streak in the sky traveling East to West at a very very fast speed with no sound;2002-09-09 20:00:00;seconds;White light streak in the sky traveling East to West at a very very fast speed with no sound I saw something that was unusual last night (September 9th) around 9 pm traveling East to West in the sky.  I was looking toward the South when I saw it.  It was a very very bright white light - in fact I thought at first it was a meteor, but then I realized it was going at a slight incline.  It appeared for a moment as a bright streak then went completely out, then on the same trajectory appeared again a little further toward the West and went out again. I had called to my husband when I saw the first streak as he was on the porch and he ran out in the yard and saw it when it reappeared for the third time and then went out.  We searched the sky to the West and it never reappeared that we could see.  It was traveling much much faster than an airplane (even a fighter jet) and there was no noise.  It was many times brighter than a plane or the space station.  As I said, it resembled a comet or meteor.  This all happened in a moment in time - very very fast.;30.721051923077;-95.5855317307692
