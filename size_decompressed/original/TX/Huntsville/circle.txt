Saw ball of light move low to ground and back up.;2017-10-16 06:15:00;5 minutes;Saw ball of light move low to ground and back up. Driving to work, I noticed what I thought to be a pretty, bright star.  As I was looking at it seemed to grow in size.  So I watched it more closely, it was definitely beginning to move. It first seemed to move towards me (west), growing brighter, but I turned north, and it continued moving in a west direction.  It got so low I could not see it through the trees any longer.  After about a minute it began to ascend and grew dimmer again until I lost visablity.;30.721051923077;-95.5855317307692
