It was about 1:45am I just look at my watch and told my wife I was going to bed. We had a guest over from the next camp site, sitting and talking with us. When thru an opening in the clouds came two saucer shaped objects very fast, then they suddenly stopped and hovered over the lake.the three of us were in shock to say the least. They made no sound like an engine would, but a slight hum was all we heard.they were about 75 yards away from us and about 30 feet above the water. one of the craft emitted a very bright beam of white light into the water. I flashed my Q-Beam at them just for a second it seamed then a bright like from the second craft shot towards us at the dock. I pulled out my pistol and fired one shot at the light.we heard a sound of the bullit hitting something but it was'nt like hitting metal. Within 10 seconds after that, they both shot up into the clouds and it was over. We hav'nt been back since..;30.721051923077;-95.5855317307692
Saw hovering disc above Denny’s that vanished.;2020-11-21 09:40:00;10 seconds;Saw hovering disc above Denny’s that vanished. I was driving with my fiancé to the Denny’s in Huntsville on Highway 30. The sky had light, wispy cloud coverage and it was bright and sunny. As I crossed the I-45 overpass, I witnessed a stationary object at around 315 degrees northwest west above the Denny’s restaurant. It appeared to be 200-300 feet in the air, but its hard to estimate accurately. I will say it appeared to be in front or in between low hanging wispy clouds. We had a light rain the previous night. The object appeared black on the bottom and silver/mirror reflective on the top, but again, it was difficult to see details due to my distance from it. It hovered as I headed towards the Denny’s and I shouted to my fiancé to look and she ignored me &#128514. What gave me pause was the fact that I simply watched it vanish. It literally blinked out of reality within seconds of me talking about it. It looked as large as a commercial airliner in terms of width. The experience happen very quickly but! I’ve never seen anything like it. It didn’t look like any recognizable aircraft. It’s stillness was very zen, like it was just mounted perfectly there in the sky. I couldn’t discern any movement at all or see any exhaust fumes. I’ll make a drawing of what I saw.;30.721051923077;-95.5855317307692
