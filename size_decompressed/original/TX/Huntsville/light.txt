Hovering Glowing object for 2 hours near Huntsville Texas that moved around the western sky and appeard to shoot objects from it;2010-08-22 23:00:00;2 hours;Hovering Glowing object for 2 hours near Huntsville Texas that moved around the western sky and appeard to shoot objects from it Tonight at approx 11pm my husband saw what looked initially like Mars in size and color.  He called me out after he had watched it fly quickly from one spot in the sky to another then stop, hover and go in circles.  he siad he saw it shoot something from it.  It was due west from our back porch.SO I came out to take a look.  It appeared to be over Huntsville Texas.   In a 2 hour period this thing hovered,went in circles horizontaly, pulsed in brightness and in size. It moved VERY quicly back and forth stood perfectly still and shot out something that shined very brightly at least twice, we both saw it happen the 2nd time.  Then the ejected object invisible, turned off its lights or burned up. As the time went on, it dropped lower than our trees.  We lost sight of itat approx 1AM.  I sat in my chair and anchored myself, because I thought maybe  My eyes were playing tricks on me.  But they were not!  This was definalty not a plane, not a helicopter, not a star, not a planet.  It appeared to have a glowing aura around it at times and I did see beams, now I dont know if that was coming from the craft or from a helicopter around it that might have been flying without its running lights.   The night was perfectly clear and it was in my sight for at least 2 hours. I hope others saw this and report it too!;30.721051923077;-95.5855317307692
