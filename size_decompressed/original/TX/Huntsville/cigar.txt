I was driving my car home from an outing at the college observatory and saw 12 cigar shaped UFO's flying wildly through the sky.  They were moving from N to S and traveling at an extremely high rate of speed.  The cigars were glowing and some type of glitter seemed to be falling off them.  I could not obtain a photo or sample of any residues that may have been dispersed (widely).  The next day I went back to the location and was unable to obtain any additional evidence for this case study.  I intend to camp out in the area next week and observe the skys with my new digital camera system with tripod.;30.721051923077;-95.5855317307692
