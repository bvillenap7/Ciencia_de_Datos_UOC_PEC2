Object with likeness of star seen moving slowly.;2015-08-18 19:40:00;20 minutes;Object with likness of star seen moving slowly. An object that looked like a star was observed by my brother, who lives next door.   I went outside to observe too.  I located object in sky directly above.  It seemed to be moving east to west slightly north.  It was moving very slow.   I checked through my apps on phone to see if it was a satellite/rocket or star.  I could not identify as satellite/rocket or star.   With binoculars, it could be seen a bit better, maybe a weather balloon but I have never seen one before.   Object suddenly disappeared after going behind a high level cloud (cirrus) that was very faint.;26.153;-97.9104000000001
