Fleet of glowing lights in RGV (Raymondville,Texas)  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-21 06:15:00;4 minutes;Fleet of glowing lights in RGV (Raymondville,Texas) 11-21-2019 at 6:15 am clear sky except one big cloud above our home. Was on my way to work when a light in the sky caught my eye, when I look up it’s a glowing light heading north east and didn’t think much of it I figured a satellite or plane.  But the. It emits brighter light and just behind it another glowing light appears heading in same direction and suddenly a third light appears out of no where and stays bright for 2-3 sec and disappears. At this point I know it’s not a satellite or plane and go into my house to call my daughter to come see what I’m looking at. When we both go back out And we still see both lights in sky and then the third light reappears very bright and 2 more glowing lights appear from a large cloud, it kinda seemed to me that the bright light was attracting them to go north east as the other 2 lights that were ahead disappeared and the 2 behind got closer to glowing light and it disappears again while the last 2 glowing lights head  north east till we couldn’t see them anymore It was 6:18 am at this point.;26.4774;-97.7878
