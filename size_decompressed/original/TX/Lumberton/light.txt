Moving bright light goes dim.;2007-11-27 19:30:00;4 minutes;Moving bright light goes dim It was after dark.  A real Clear and bright night.  I looked up at the stars and for a quick few minutes.  I saw a bright light moving about as fast as you usually see an airplane at night.  But the weird thing was I could tell it was at a very high altitude. Anyway the light was bright then went into a very dim mode.  I could barely see it as it was moving from south to the north. The nearest major airport is about 100 miles away if that means anything.

Red flying lights saturate night sky!!;2017-12-09 20:35:00;2 hours;Red flying lights saturate night sky!! I am barely making this report because I am my worse enemy, talking myself out of making this report thinking that it had to be drones, but the more I hear about others witnessing the same experience and I had my two boys and 3 nephews with me, I am convinced this was something more wonderful than I could ever imagine.  I seen had to be hundred of red lights, seemed like they were playing in the sky.  They had no direct path, they would move around slowly and some clustered together while others wandered off alone.  I heard a gasp from my son and turned and he said he seen two shoot off fast across the sky..  I missed it, but the gasp i heard spoke for itselfâ€¦ It was a freezing night, and i kept wanting to grab my ipad from inside but I was frozen, I feared it would leave, and then I thought there was no way it would capture on my ipad, but none the less i went inside.  It was very cold and we couldnt stand to be outside that long and none of my windows allowed me to look up straight into the sky,  as i was blocked by trees...about a hour later,  I went to throw the trash away and I still seen about half of them up there...I regret the fact that I did not try to record it but I seen them and i have 5 other teenagers who witnessed this amazing night too.  It seemed like they were putting on a show..  They were hovering slowly.;30.2781;-94.2167000000003
Red lights across the sky.;2017-12-09 20:40:00;1-2 hours;Red lights across the sky I am making this report now because my mom just made her report and insist that I describe my experience as well..I have to admit I am a skeptic, but what I did see that night makes me scratch my head.  We had just came home from picking up my cousins and my mom loves UFO's she always looks in the sky, and next I heard her saying, Look!!  Look up!! and this is what I seen--100's of red lights in clusters or little groups but many groups slowly pulsating and hovering.  At first I thought this has to be some drone convention or drone practicing a routine but the longer I watched the more intrigued I became and knew this was not drones.  Me and my cousin happen to look south and see two lights bolt across the sky, we screamed at the sight, and caused everyone to look our way but it was gone by then.
