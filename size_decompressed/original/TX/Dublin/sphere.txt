We were 8 miles south of Dublin, TX looking West.  We saw a series of small round lights that alternated flashing in different parts of the western sky.   Additionally the lights also sequenced 3-4 at a time in a sickle shape pattern.   Additonally the lights changed from Yellow-orange to white and then back to yellow-orange.  At first they appeared like firewoks in that they illuminated, brightened, then faded and then reappeared in another location.;32.0908;-98.3503
