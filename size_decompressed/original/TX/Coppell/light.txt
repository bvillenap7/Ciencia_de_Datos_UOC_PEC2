Light object flying toward ground;2004-01-09 00:12:00;2 seconds;Light object flying toward ground My boyfriend and I were sitting outside on his balcony in Coppell, TX.  We were discussing finances.  I was sitting on a patio chair looking out and he was facing me.  While we were in the middle of a discussion, I saw a light object fly towards the ground and disappear in mid-air.  It had no tail or streak.  It was approx. the diameter of a pinky finger nail at arms distance.  The object seemed to be very close.  Not like a shooting star, but more like a light that would turn on and off from a short distance.  The object appeared in my viewing area going towards the ground and disappeared shortly.  It did not fade out, it was as if it was turned off.  The night was clear w/ no clouds in the area.  There was no noise associated with the viewing.  It was a very still and quiet night.  Not sure what it was.  I do know that it was not a shooting star, satellite, or aircraft of terrestial origin.  My boyfriend is an avid star gazer.  We have seen many shooting stars and satellites.  The object seemed so close.  Very weird!!;32.9609292168674;-96.9845141566271
((HOAX??))  A light from the sky, with no sound, and this was clearly squared , it was a soft scanning light like a copier machine;2011-09-04 02:45:00;5 seconds;A light from the sky, with no sound, and this was clearly squared , it was a soft scanning light like a copier machine I let my dog out at 2:45am,  it was completely dark in our back yard, I waited at the sliding glass door from the patio,  our patio has long overhang, as I watched my dog go, a soft light beamed down and scanned my dog in a matter of seconds.   The scan width was 5 ft and broadcast my backyard about 15 feet.  I thought for a second it might be a police spotlight, but I heard no sound, and this was clearly squared , it was a soft scanning light like a copier machine.  I did not step out to investigate, and it happend so fast that I wasn't alarmed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Possible hoax.
