An object that appeared to be cloaked.;2013-10-24 21:00:00;5 minutes;An object that appeared to be cloaked. It was dark outside and myself and 2 others  were standing in our backyard around the pool when we observed it.  The object was moving towards our location which is very close to DFW airport. There were almost no clouds in the sky but the object the best way I can explain it appeared to be “cloaked” or surrounded by a cloud that was changing colors. The object/cloud was maybe a couple hundred feet off the ground and moved rather slowly but it did change speeds.  It changed direction a couple of times before heading off  towards DFW airport and lake Lewisville. The weather was calm and there was no sound but it probably came within 100 yards of the house. There  is no way it was a cloud because of the way it changed its direction and speed.;32.9609292168674;-96.9845141566271
