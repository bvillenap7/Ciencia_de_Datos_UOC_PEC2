Three small triangular shaped objects fly through my telescopes field of view.;2004-08-26 20:35:00;1 sec;Three small triangular shaped objects fly through my telescopes field of view. My son and I went outside this evening to look at the moon through our telescope (60mm diameter 800mm focal length - 25mm eye piece Kellner .96).  I was talking to my 6 year old son about the craters on the moon and what caused them.  As I began to move away from the eye piece, so he could have another look, I saw 3 triangular objects move directly through the middle of my field of view toward the west.  With this telescope the moon almost fills the field of view.  With a bright and almost full moon as a background the objects appeared to be black.  They passed by the moon in about one second.  Right through the middle of the moon.  They seemed to be very far away from us.  But I can't be sure of that.  I immediately looked up with my naked eye but couldn't see anything.  No lights, nothing.  They seemed to be exactly the same distance from each other.  Similar to the way figher jets fly in formation.  I'll try to give an example of their size.  If you have a grapefruit, then take 3 peas (pretend they are triangular shaped peas) and make a triangle with them in the middle of the grapfruit and separate them by about 1/4 inch then you would understand the size and the relationship between the 3 objects that I saw through the telescope.  I didn't notice any vapor trails, no distortion of the atmosphere from the heat of an exhaust or anything like that. I don't know what I heck I saw.;32.9609292168674;-96.9845141566271
