Writing in the sky.;2015-07-01 08:15:00;40 minutes;Writing in the sky. As my husband and I were driving home from dropping off my car for repairs, we were down the street from our home, when I looked up and saw wiring (sic. Writing) in the sky.  I was trying to take pictures while we drove but it was to shaky and you many trees.  We arrived home and I saw another letter or number being created but the craft creating it was not visible.   I have a picture and video of this happening.   It liked (sic.  Looked) like maybe boom town 7/3.  Very weird.;32.9609292168674;-96.9845141566271
