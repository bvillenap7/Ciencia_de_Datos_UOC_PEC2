Well i was in the truck wih my parents one late night, and my step dad saw,bright lights in the sky and they were turning on and off all in a row.  Me and my mother were in shock.  the object wasn't moving,and was orange,it was also forming a triangle shape almost then the lights thurned off.   I can not explain the size in detail. The location was in goldthwaite,Tx.  We seemed to be in the middle of no where, with no sign of town lights.  We were the only ones on the road, and we were headed towards lubbock.;31.4453;-98.5825
