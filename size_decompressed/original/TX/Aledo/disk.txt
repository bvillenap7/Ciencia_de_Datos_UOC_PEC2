1 DISC shaped object - did not seem to be controlled;2004-02-26 17:00:00;10 minutes;1 DISC shaped object - did not seem to be controlled At about 5:00pm CST my father arrived home from work and told me that he had spotted something outside and wanted my opinion on it. I went outside and looked up to see an object rather high up, and floating along at a liesurely pace. The object would waiver back and forth showing that it was a flat disc.  I watched it for about 10 minutes before it floated quite high and became very hard to see. I wouldnt be reporting this except for the fact that this object seemed to be rather large, and it was a disc shape... i've never heard of a weather balloon in this shape before. There were no lights at all on the object, no sound, and it had a shiny metallic skin. I *think* there was a design on the flat face of the object, but I couldn't make it out.  I really do not know what to make of this... I think it was probably just a balloon since it never acted like it was under control, but its definately the strangest thing I have seen in the sky to date.;32.7003;-97.6086
