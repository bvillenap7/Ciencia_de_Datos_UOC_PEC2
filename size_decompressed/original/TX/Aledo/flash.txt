Outside the window, a bright star caught my eyes.  Then I noticed it’s not like a star, it’s about 10 times bigger than stars.  I never saw a big star at that spot.   I looked steadily at it.  It seems getting bigger and bigger and moving towards me.  There’s red lights flashing around the lower right.  This is definitely not a star. It’s on the east side of sky.  It’s just hanging in there till the sun comes up and no longer can be seen In the bright blue sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.
