Bright lights hover over pasture.  ((anonymous report));2018-03-23 21:30:00;30 seconds;Bright lights hover over pasture. In the country, 4 miles NW of Aledo, Texas 5 miles West of the Joint Reserve Base, Fort Worth, I was inside walking towards my back glass sliding doors when a group of four very bright lights over my pasture caught my attention.  The lights were so low and bright, my first thought was that a plane was coming down right towards my house.  I was about to yell for my wife to run out the front in case there was a crash, then I realized that the lights were not moving at all.  I heard no noise and would have heard an air craft this close.  The lights were so bright that I could not discern the shape of the object.  There were 3 lights in a row with the middle slightly lower and one offset and up to the right, as if there was a missing light between them.  The object was approximately 200 ft. in the air, 1,500 ft. away, about the size of a half-dollar at arm's length, so it had to be in excess of 40' or more wide. I watched the object for 30+ seconds and ran to get my cell phone camera in the next room.  I was gone less than 15 seconds but when I got back, it was gone (and, very oddly, my cell phone went down, then came back on while I was wondering what happened to it). I immediately went outside and searched the sky in all directions, no plane, helicopters or anything else was airborne.  It is impossible for any typical aircraft to not be still visible in that time.  We are in the flight path of Joint Reserve Base air craft and Care Flight Helicopters from Weatherford to Fort Worth daily.  This object did not resemble any of those.  It is now 2am and I still haven't been able to sleep.  This event was so unexpected all I could think to say was Jeez-Louise!
