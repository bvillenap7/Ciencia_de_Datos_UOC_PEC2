Me and my girlfriend were sneaking out one night around 2:00 a.m.  We got to the end of my drive way and we looked out in the pasture across the road about 100 to 125 yards away and we saw what looked like a flashlight on the ground but then it rose in the air about 40 feet and it was then about the size of a basketball and it started to hover left to right slowly with no sound at all and then it went behind the house across the road and then it shot over the trees and our heads and it went to fast after that to keep our eyes on it.It did not let off any beam of light it was like a solid form.  It was not like a light bulb it did not light up the sky any and it did not light up the trees either when it went through them. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.3317;-95.0483
