Bright lights over the southern and south eastern skies of Vernon, TX.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect stars or planets.  PD));2008-11-29 20:00:00;undetermined;Bright lights over the southern and south eastern skies of Vernon Texas We live out in the country about 17miles southwest of Vernon, Texas.  For about two months now we have seen objects in the southern, eastern skies.  These objects would move radically not accustom to known aircraft.  It has been seen that when a plane or jet would be heading in the same direction, the object(light) would go stationary.  After the plane or jet had passed the light(object) would continue its radical movements.  It is unknown how far these objects are away, but far enough that there is no way to determine the shape or how big the object is.  The only description is like looking at a star.  Sometimes the lights change colors.   The flight pattern (?) of these objects is from side to side, up and down and diagonally and some times in circles.  If looking in the sky, possibly do to the distance factor, the objects move the approximate length of a foot in the sky.  Also the object is always bright, no flickering as a plane or jet.
