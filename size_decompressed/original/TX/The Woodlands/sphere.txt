We were just talking before it was time for me to go inside for the night. We were facing south. I noticed an orange light in my peripheral. At first, I thought it was the streetlight but I realized that it was shaking and moving across the sky. I turned my head and saw that it was two orange spheres, seeming to shake rapidly as they moved smoothly and silently across the sky. They looked like they were made of light. One was in front and higher in the sky than the second light, but they moved perfectly synchronized. They were moving east to west. Once they were almost in front of us, they stopped moving in the sky, stopped shaking too. They just froze and hovered for a few seconds. They were orange balls about the size of the full moon. They seemed to be flat, like 2D, and multifaceted like bicycle reflectors. But it was hard to understand what they really were. What happened next is hard to explain: They were hanging in the air, one higher and more to the left of the other. Then, simultaneously, they shifted in the air so that the higher one was now in the lower position and the lower one was now in the higher position. They froze again. Then they shifted back and froze. Then, they just LEFT. They ascended into the stars just fast enough for your eyes to follow â€“ FAST. Up, gone, away. They didn't seem to accelerate, just suddenly gone. It was amazing and I will never forget. Years later, I thought they must have known we were watching but who knows?  I swear to this story.
