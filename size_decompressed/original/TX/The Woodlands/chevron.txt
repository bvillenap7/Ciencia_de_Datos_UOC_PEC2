It's a clear, cold night and I was outside with my telescope facing ESE at Orion. I looked up from the telescope when at about my 11:00 position I spotted a V-shaped formation of circular diffuse white lights on the underside of a 'solid' V-shaped 'fuselage' which was transparent (could see star field behind it) and shimmered like a mirage. From 4 to 6 closely spaced lights down each leg of V and 1 at point. Their diameter was nearly the width of each leg. They pulsed slowly (approx. 1 sec intervals) and simultaneously, and shimmered in sync with rest of craft. At first sight it was at least as big as both fists held at arms length. Estimate altitude at between 2000 and 5000ft. Traveled straight and level SSE at what must have been thousands of miles per hour and was completely silent. Fantastic, dizzying speed. Within view for approx. 5 sec. At last sight it was about the width of my pinky at arms length.;30.1435714285714;-95.4656357142857
