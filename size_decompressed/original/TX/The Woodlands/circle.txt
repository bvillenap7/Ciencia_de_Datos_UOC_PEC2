Driving E, I noticed a large bluish green light shaped like a ball moving smooth and extremely fast.  ((anonymous report));2019-03-15 06:20:00;5 seconds;I was driving my car in an eastern direction and noticed a large bluish green light shaped like a ball moving smooth and extremely fast, much fast than a fighter jet approximately 10000 feet and there was no noise while it flew through the sky.  The unknown flying object was the size of a blimp.  Iâ€™m still in a state of shock from this unusual sight that occurred at 6:20 A.M. 3/15/2019, as I was exiting my immediate neighborhood street.  I truly pray there maybe others that witnessed this strange bright bluish green orb that soard quietly and quickly across the early morning horizon.
