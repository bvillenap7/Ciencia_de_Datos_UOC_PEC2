2 orange lights type UFOs seen in Houston area on July 4, 2013;2013-07-04 22:10:00;5 minutes;2 orange lights type UFOs seen in Houston area on July 4, 2013 As we were driving back from the fireworks show at Northshore park at 10pm, heading west bound on Sterling Ridge Dr, we noticed 2 orange triangular shaped lights in the sky heading northwest in a straight line.  The lights were solid orange and not flashing like an airplane lights.   We approached the intersection of Carlton Woods Dr and then made a u-turn in the round about to face back towards east bound direction of Sterling Ridge Dr.   The 2 lights continued in the northwest direction and then went behind some trees momentarily.  I noticed one of the lights flicker and then both lights disappeared.  We drove around to see if the lights had continued on the straight line path, and they were not there anymore.;30.1435714285714;-95.4656357142857
