Donuts on a rope smoke trail in the sky pointing west.;2000-03-25 18:00:00;18:01;Donuts on a rope smoke trail in the sky pointing west. I looked up and saw donuts on a rope smoke trail.  I could not get too a clear area to see the source of the trail, but did see that it was two lines of smoke before becoming one line with the loops. The trail did not last very long and looked very high.

Just a strange light;2006-02-15 02:00:00;5 seconds;Just a strange light Not sure what i just saw, i stepped out side to smoke a cigarette. I just happened to walk to the edge of my porch and look at the moon,  Beings that the were not many clouds out. I saw a White Ball of Light fall from the sky, took about 5 secondsto fall from far up into the sky. Any who my next door neighbors house blocked my line of sight after wards so no clue what the hell it was. i DO live neer a airport but, this was too close and moving to fast to be a Plane, a Jet perhaps But there was no noise ( typical ).  i waited and listened for a crashing noise, but then i started getting a bad feeling bout staying out side, i never heard any thing after that so i went back inside.  I thought it may have been a Meteor, but it couldnt be. They look way different from what i saw. Any who. i did a search on UFOs i guess for Shits and Giggles. found this Odd web site and figured what the hell.  Some body may want to know.  As long as yall dont be bugging me about it cause i have nothing more to say on this topic. i already belive firmly the we are not alone, and perhaps its only a matter of time before we find out 100%.;30.1435714285714;-95.4656357142857
Pulsating light emitting no sound moving slowly above my neighborhood;2009-10-25 19:55:00;45 Seconds;Pulsating light emitting no sound moving slowly above my neighborhood I was seated on my patio in the backyard and was having smoking a cigarette. Noticed a pulsating red light 150 ft above ground just above the pine trees.  The object was a red, pulsating light.  The object came from the ESE and was heading WNW. The object emitted no sound and was visible for an eight of a mile through the trees.;30.1435714285714;-95.4656357142857
