2 orange fireballs moving across sky ~ crazy acrobatics;1996-10-01 22:30:00;2-3 minutes;2 orange fireballs moving across sky ~ crazy acrobatics This happened many years ago, but I still remember it clearly.  I was sitting outside my house in The Woodlands, talking to my boyfriend. It was a nice warm, cloudless night. Two orangish amber colored fireballs appeared on the east side of the sky, moving west at a relatively slow pace.  These objects seemed to be VERY close-by but I have no way to say how close. They made no noise.  They were at least as big as a half-dollar if you hold it at arm's length. They had an erratic, shaking look to them as they moved directly south of us.  They then stopped and stayed hovering in the air.  Their shakiness stopped and they were completely frozen. One was slightly lower in the sky than the other.  It was very hard to discern what they were. They had a multifaceted look to them, much like reflectors from a bicycle wheel or something. They seemed very flat it was hard to make out any actual 3D form to them.  Then, after sitting there about 5 seconds, they suddenly shifted very quickly in the sky so that the lower one was now higher and the once-higher one was now lower. It is very difficult to explain in a narrative.  They froze again, shifted back to their ori! ginal positions.  They hung for another few seconds and then suddenly accelerated into the stars almost too fast for the eyes to follow.  Almost like how a shooting star is almost too fast to see, so these were gone in an instant. I can say with certainty that they went UP. I have a masters degree in psychology, I have taken astronomy in college. I have lived near air force and other military bases. I have a very rational mind and I have no idea what I saw that night. I know that this is quite the claim to make but I swear that it happened ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
