Through Facebook and Youtube.  Being a current student of aviation, I sat out with equipment to see what was happening.  I utilize three software apps while observing the sky.  Freeflight24, Satellite, and Freeskypro.  This helps pass the time.  And correctly ID objects at a distance.  At the end of my session I wanted to take a picture of the horizon so I powered up my (Sony dhc xv100) and set it to low light.  At this point I could not see the object with my own eyes.  After adjusting the ISO an image came into frame.  I checked the lens for dust with a Trijicon lens duster object was still there, I could faintly see it with my own eyes.  It was hovering above the Westco Plaze about 500â€™ still very faint and hard to see with my own eyes.  But clearly visible on the camera.  After sever very low clouds moved in, the object was no longer visible.;30.1435714285714;-95.4656357142857
