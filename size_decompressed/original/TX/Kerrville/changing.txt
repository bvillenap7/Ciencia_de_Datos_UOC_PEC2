Ilooked up and saw a long vertical white glowing light. I thought it was just a sliver of the moon peeking through or even the tail of an aircraft. Then it began to move slowly and suddenly turned bright orange and began moving through the sky like a comet not really too fast though. I had my Mom pull over so I could take some video. As we stopped the object became stationary again but still glowed bright orange. I was able to get this on video. Then it just seemed to move further away until we could no longer see it. I am a very rational person, I also work in the aviation business and I know this was no type of aircraft.  I want to know if anyone else saw this object. I also want to know if anyone would be interested in the video I took since it is actually a very clear view of the object. What should I do with this info?;30.0451000000001;-99.1417000000001
