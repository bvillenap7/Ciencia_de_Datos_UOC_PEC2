White ball of light moving erratically in multiple directions and shining a rotating beam of light from its sides.;2019-09-20 20:30:00;1 minute;White ball of light moving erratically in multiple directions and shining a rotating beam of light from its sides. While walking my dog, I noticed a circular ball of light that seemed to have a glow around it that was revolving as it moved.  It appeared to be moving like a shooting star at a much slower speed.  It moved in a straight path for a few seconds and was at its brightest when I first noticed it.  Soon it began to move erratically it appeared to stop in place for a few seconds then move in a different direction with speeds alternating between fast and slow.  The strangest part is its altitude also spiked very fast and when it went higher the light seemed to disappear until it was in a new position in the sky.  I live very close to Mooney airport so I am familiar with aircraft, but the planes I see have more than one light, usually two in front and one in back, also they don’t have glow around them.  I have seen a couple planes with headlights but none that emit light similar to the spinning of a lighthouse. I got the sense from it’s behavior that it was searching for ! something.  I asked my brother to check it out, but the time it took for him to walk two feet from under the porch into the yard, it disappeared from the night sky.  I walked to the back of my house and noticed very bright flashes of white and blue light coming from the trees on the right side of the woods in my neighbor’s backyard.  The diameter of the light looked to be about 7ft and maybe a foot or two off the ground.  There was no noise and the flashes seemed to overlap each other.  In just 15 seconds, there were probably 25 flashes.;30.0451000000001;-99.1417000000001
