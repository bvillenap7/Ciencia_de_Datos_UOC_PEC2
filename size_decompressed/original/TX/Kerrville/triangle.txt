Red triangular lights and sphere witnessed by 3 people in early morning sky in Texas.;2016-10-10 05:00:00;:35;Red triangular lights and sphere witnessed by 3 people in early morning sky in Texas. I had observed this several times but on this morning it was close enough to view some detail with my binoculars.  The object was in the south west sky in the lower quadrant toward the horizon.  It appears as a triangle with red lights at the corners, because I could see more detail this time a metallic sphere was in the middle of the triangle and when it stopped moving the sphere would move out of the triangle then prior to moving again the sphere would move back into the triangle and it would continue on a random course moving up down and horizontally.  Once as an aircraft approached the object lowered to the horizon and set there until the plane was well past its position then rose up and continued the random pattern. I have witnessed these objects (I have seen up to 3 at one time) for the past year but this was the first time to be able to make out any detail.;30.0451000000001;-99.1417000000001

I in turn walked out and went onto telling him it was probably a star, or a plane. When I focused in on the unknown object I noticed the shape was triangular with the point facing down and a green skinny beam shooting straight up from the middle of the triangular object.  To the naked eye the object seamed to be not moving but red and green lights were lighting around the object sporadically and caught my attention so much I decided to start recording what me and my friend were witnessing.  The beginning of the video I had my phone in my hand while it was directed straight at the object while i stepped forwards a place to prop up the phone. In the video I zoomed in as much as my phone would let me and just sat and watched my phone screen as it was recording the object. The glowing, light up object was pulsating as well as bouncing up and down up and down then would just disappear. All of a sudden the object would be back on the screen in a different position glowing brighter. When I would look away from my screen the object was not moving as far as I could see with my naked eye, but was darting all over the place on the screen which really freaked me out then the object disappeared again. Returned. Disappeared for a good while and then all of a sudden the object came back clear vision bright as ever and just kept getting brighter and bigger and turns green. Then disappeared and my camera couldn't record any longer.;30.0451000000001;-99.1417000000001
