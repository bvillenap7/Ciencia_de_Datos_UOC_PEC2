Large flaming light pulsed dim to bright then faded into darkness over Lake Travis.;2010-02-27 23:10:00;4 minutes;Large flaming light pulsed dim to bright then faded into darkness over Lake Travis. If the zenith or straight up is 90 degrees than the blinking flame red light was approximately 25 degrees from horizon. My view was from a high position over looking Lake Travis and the hills around it. The shape was circular, although, it had the effect of appearing to be two lights/circles contained in one craft. But what was clear was that it was a deep flaming color that didn't indicate any aircraft I've ever seen, but possibly a satellite, though it would be very large if one. I watched as the light pulsed from dim to bright at a slow pace. After a few minutes it went dim to darkness.;30.3899000000001;-98.0539000000001

The stars at night were big and bright. These weren’t stars!;2019-11-25 18:00:00;20 minutes;The stars at night were big and bright. These weren’t stars! Two lights side by side very bright on the southwest night sky. We thought they were stars but the location appeared to be too low in the sky. After a couple of minutes the right light faded out. It re appeared in about a minute. They never moved or appeared to drift away. We live by 2 airports and know what aircraft look and sound like at night. These two balls of white light glowed bright and made no sound. It was difficult to judge the distance or size.;30.3899000000001;-98.0539000000001
