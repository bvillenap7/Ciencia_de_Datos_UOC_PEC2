Saw cylinder shaped object with lights that disappeared  abruptly.;2003-01-08 18:15:00;3 minutes;Saw cylinder shaped object with lights that disappeared  abruptly. I was inside looking out at the evening sky when I noticed a bright cylinder shaped object moving slowly from east to west coming in the direction of my house. At first I thought it was a chopper, as we have many flying over our house on Lake Travis. As I watched it come closer, I noticed that it seemed to have many lights in a clump, with other lights below it a little hard to explain. I also noticed that it was moving in a starting and stopping pattern, rather than smooth.  It did stay on the same course.  I turned my head to knock on the window,so that my husband could come out and seeit when I looked back up, it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at some length, and we found her to be quite credible.  We note that satellites that do not have a western component to their groundtrack.

The object appeared to be drifting north at the same speed of the clouds at  approximately 25kts.  There was no sound or lateral movement and the object appeared to have no wings.   The longitudinal axis of the object was oriented in the direction of movement with no tumbling such as might be the case if it were an untethered balloon.   It was first sighted with the naked eye and I also observed it with low power binoculars.   There was an appearance of markings, but I was unable to distinguish the pattern.;30.3899000000001;-98.0539000000001
