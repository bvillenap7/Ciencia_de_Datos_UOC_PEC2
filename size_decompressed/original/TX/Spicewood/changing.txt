orange lights seen in the area of Briarcliff, Texas near Lake Travis.;2020-08-01 17:00:00;10 minutes;orange lights seen in the area of Briarcliff, Texas near Lake Travis. Though our address is in Spicewood, this sighting was seen closer to Briarcliff.  From the neighborhood of West Cypress HIlls, off Highway 71, we saw 5 orange lights.  After the first one, my partner came into the house and told me.  I went back outside and saw the rest  They appeared to be coming from the lake, north of our position.  The orange lights did not flash at all.  They seemed to follow the same path and they each disappeared at the same spot in the sky.  We did not hear any sound coming from them.  It was partly cloudy that night, but there were no clouds where the orange lights disappeared.  The moon was full.  The ones I saw seemed to appear one after another.  They were round with a smaller round shape on top.  We thought they were drones at first, but the lights were orange and didn't blink.  Since they disappeared, we don't think they were drones.  I don't see any record of anyone else seeing these lights, so I wanted to make sure this was recorded.;30.3899000000001;-98.0539000000001
