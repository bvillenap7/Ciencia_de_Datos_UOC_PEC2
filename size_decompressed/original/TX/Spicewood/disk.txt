Sighting of a color changing UFO in Texas.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from student.  PD));2006-10-22 13:00:00;1 minute;Sighting of a color changing UFO in Texas Me, my step-brother, and my sister were playing basketball on our street when all of a sudden my brother looked up and saw an object in the sky.  He alerted me and my sister immediately when he saw it and we looked at it trying to figure out if it was an airplane or not. It looke to saucer-shaped to be an airplane so we knew then and there that before our very eyes was a UFO. I quickly got my cell phone out and snapped a picture of it. After I snapped the picture the top of it turned a bluish color. It freaked us out. We were in awe, but after it turned blue it zoomed off very fast. The weird part is that the object had no sound to like a normal aircraft would. It wasnt in very clear view so we couldnt see much but it was a very dark gray color almost black...maybe charcoal colored. After it zoomed off we ran inside and showed our parents the picture and explained to them what happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));30.3899000000001;-98.0539000000001
