Woke up from a bad dream with a sensation of being pinned down on the ground.  My distress woke up my brother and boyfriend.  My brother was acting panicked and told us to look up through the tent.  There were dozens of lights, moving in a way we had never seen.   After around ten minutes, they all moved out of line of view very quickly.  The sun was about to come up so we stepped out of the tent.  There was a shiny, smooth, silver oval suspended in the sky at an angle with no visible lines or orifices.  It stayed about 100 yards suspended for at least ten minutes.   The sky became very clear and blue by this point.  It began moving towards us but then slowly backed away before shooting out of sight very quickly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
