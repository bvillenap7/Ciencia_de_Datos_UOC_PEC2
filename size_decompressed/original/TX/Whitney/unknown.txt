Saw a group of red and white flashing lights moving from my north east to my south east followed by 4 to 5 smaller groups.  would have been moving north to south, paralell to I-35, aproxiamately from Dallas-Fort worth to Waco.  The first was largest and appeared to be at the same speed an altitude as a large jet.   It took about 3-5 minutes to traverse my whole field of view.  the other sets of lights followed at about the same speed and altitude at about 1 minute 3 minute intervals.  Through binoculars all that could be seen were red and white lights, approximately in an oval shape that were very bright and flashed off and on rapidly (disco lights).  the other sets were smaller but had the same red and white disco lights.  I would think it was a jet but I never saw any more jets take the path in the 3 nights I was there.  This would mainly be to confirm someone elses sighting if there are any other reports from D_FW/ Waco/ San Antonio.;31.9643;-97.3374999999999
