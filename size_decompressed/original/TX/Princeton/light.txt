moving star abruptly stops, waits, then changes course;2005-08-26 22:00:00;5 minutes;moving star abruptly stops, waits, then changes course While stargazing with my girlfriend she pointed out to me what appeared to be a star moving slowly from North to South in the northeaster sky, almost directly overhead.  As soon as i had pointed out that it had no running lights it stopped abruptly and ceased moving. I was observing through binoculars, and after about 30 seconds it began to move very slowly down to the East.  While attempting to move to get a better view we lost the object.
