Large Metallic object hovering in skies above Dallas on 09112008 at 7:27 am sighting lasted only 3 seconds;2008-09-11 07:27:00;2-3 Seconds;Large Metallic object hovering in skies above Dallas on 09112008 at 7:27 am sighting lasted only 3 seconds I was traveling South on Luna, just past Valley View, when I looked over towards the Eastern sky and saw a large metallic reflection in the rough shape of a teardrop laying on its side and smashed a tad. This object appeared to be metallic in nature because of the quality of the surface reflections. It reflected shades of salmon/pink and yellow on its surface. This was particularly noticeable, because the prevailing weather conditions this morning at 7 am was thick gray clouds in all directions. The object looked to be in the distant sky approximately 9.8 miles (the distance from Luna @ 635 to 635 @ 75 via Google Maps) but was large to my vantage point. I looked solidly at this object for a mere 2-3 seconds before diverting my attention back to the road I was currently driving down. After a quick 2 seconds glance to the road, I looked back and was perplexed to find the object no longer was visible to me, even though, i had a clear view of all skies around me in my convertible jeep wrangler. I wonder if anyone else saw this object today.;32.9249315789471;-96.8907649122808
