Slowly rotating car tire shaped object (no hole) rotated slowly 100 feet off the golf course surface, had port holes.;1973-08-15 20:00:00;15 minutes;Slowly rotating car tire shaped object (no hole) rotated slowly 100 feet off the golf course surface, had port holes. It was summer around 1972 or 1973 and my father who was an ex-NASA employee from the late 1960â€™s (satellite designer) called the whole family outside to see something.  My dad, mom, brother, sister and myself all went outside.  Hovering above the golf course 200-250 feet west of our house was a HUGE disk shaped object.  It was actually shaped exactly like a car tire with no center hole.  Since it was dusk what we were watching was actually the black silhouette outlined in the brighter evening sky, rather than seeing the clear surface of the object.   The object spun slowly and moved back and forth in a straight line while traversing in a searching manner away from us.  It had already passed over our house and was moving away westward.   As we watched it became apparent there were round port holes all around it every 4-5 feet or so.  They appeared to be about 12-14 inches in diameter.  It seemed like every other one was red or yellowish-white.  The object was about 60 feet in diameter and about 6 feet thick and rotating slowly as it slowly came back east toward our back yard. Its height was no more than 120-140 feet off the ground (perhaps as low as 100 feet).  I remember thinking I could hit it with a rock.  It did not wobble on its axis as a balloon might but was perfectly controlled like a wheel spinning on an axle.  It moved very slowly (perhaps 5 mph) and came right up to the SW corner of our yard where it paused (about 60 feet away and 100 feet high) before it slowly started reversing direction to head back across the golf course toward the south side of Green Acres Terrace Circle which was directly west across the golf course from our house.   When it got over to the circle on Green Acres Terrace it reversed again and came back toward us but only came back until it was about 100 yards away this time.  When it reversed this time it went farther away and then came back toward us again but did not get as close as the previous time.  I asked my father, Dad, what is that? He said, I don't know. I knew what it was a UFO.   I told my brother to go inside and get my Polaroid camera. He said, YOU go get it!  The object seemed to be almost swinging back and forth as it moved in a kind of searching pattern back and forth across the golf course moving further away with each pass until it was gone within 15-20 minutes.  It was rotating slowly the whole time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));32.9249315789471;-96.8907649122808
