Long green curved-at-the-edges line. Horizontal;2008-10-18 03:40:00;<1min;Long green curved-at-the-edges line.  Horizontal Long, horizontal curved line appeared for about 4 seconds travelling south-east.  I was looking at the moon and orion's belt (the 3 stars that line up in the sky), heard a whistling-like noise and looked below orion's belt and the moon and saw a green, horizontal curved line pass through the sky.;32.9249315789471;-96.8907649122808
Fast moving object;2020-10-06 06:15:00;3-4 seconds;fast moving object I was sitting outside facing due east. My gaze was drawn up to a point of light about 45 degrees off the horizon. It was just a flash but it had a discernable round shape. It flew west and was immediately over my head. I stood and turned but it was gone. It was brighter than any star (and more focused) but moved much faster than any normal aircraft. Regardless of its distance from me nothing other than the space shuttle or possibly a meter could have moved that fast other than perhaps a missile or other such projectile. It had no engine noise and was silent BUT unlike a meteor it had no trail or “streak” of light, it was perfectly focused. I can only estimate its’ speed  under two possible circumstances IF it was 20 miles or more away then its’ speed had to be in the thousand of MPH. If it was within a couple of miles then it might have appeared to be moving at 800-1000 MPH. Every previously known experience I’ve had rules out every possibility that I am familiar with. It was too fast or too quiet or too bright and focused.;32.9249315789471;-96.8907649122808
