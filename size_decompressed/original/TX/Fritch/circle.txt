Duration, 15 seconds, 2 witnesses at 9:35 pm.Fritch tx. My son and I got home from his basketball game and were walking in and to the west about 30 degrees up in the sky we saw what we thought was a planet.  It was orange with some yellow color in it flickering brighter then dimming in a stationary position for about 8 seconds.  Then the object started to move to the south very slowly, still circular in form but getting brighter in intensity. As the object continued to the south it dipped down about 5 degrees very quickly continuing at the same slow pace south bound as before. Then three slow out of time blinking lights appeared on the outside of the object, pulsing off and on but not like a planes lights blink.  Then the bright orange, yellowish center of the object went out and just the little blinking lights remained. The craft continued south bound very slow and then dissapeared, not because it was too far to see but just vanished.  This all took place over a span of about 15 seconds. My family always watch the skies at night and in the daytime.  We have a mare than basic understanding of fundemental sciences and other related topics.  Always using logic first in any situaion in life. It was as if the ufo changed itself from a stationary object to a mimic of a small plane. I cant figure this one out using normal logic.;35.6441;-101.5785
