I then called for my kids and they came and saw the object also and then it started to moving again after being still for 10 seconds and the took off again but faster this time.   There were no blinking lights to indicate it as a helicopter or plane and as we watched it over a period of about five minutes, moving to the south at about the same height and speed it just vanished.   We still were watching to see if it would appear again and as we were looking east my son saw a white light to the west about 1 minute later moving at the same rate of speed, the same brightness and white color and it also like the first one just faded away and was gone.  No blinking lights, no other colors.  It was like the object in the east had disapeared and then was on the western horizon and then disapeared.  Me and my four children all were witnesses to this.;35.6441;-101.5785
