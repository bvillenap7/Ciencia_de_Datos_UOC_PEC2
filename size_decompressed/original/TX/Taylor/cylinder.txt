Object seen during lightning storm.;2014-06-12 21:22:00;1 second;Object seen during lightning storm On Thursday June 12, 2014, at or around 2122, I took a video of a lightning storm near my house.   After taking this video I took a screenshot of an exceptionally bright lightning strike and proceeded to upload it to my social network page.  After looking at the picture I noticed what appeared to be a “blob” on the picture.  I looked at the “blob” and noticed it was a black dot that had appeared in the night sky and could be seen as a result of the intensity of the lightning.  The lightning had lit up the night sky as to make it day and you can clearly see this black dot in the sky when you freeze the video. 	I replayed the video to make sure there were no low flying planes in that specific area and showed this picture and video to two other people to verify the accuracy of what I thought I saw.  In the picture you can see a cylindrical object in the sky and as you zoom in, you can clearly see what appears to be some type of “force field” surrounding the object.;30.5708999999999;-97.4092999999996
