2-4 bright lights hovering over Granger, TX.;2012-11-08 17:45:00;30 minutes;2-4 bright lights hovering over Granger, TX Thursday evening I was driving north down Highway 95 from Taylor to Granger, TX.  I saw 3 extremely bright large twinkling lights in a triangle formation fairly low to the ground hovering over what looked like the Granger, TX area.   It was so unusual that I did not turn down FM 1331 but stayed on Hwy 95 to try and get a closer look at the lights.  They stayed in the tight triangular formation for several minutes & then one instantly disappeared.  The other 2 stayed for a couple of minutes longer & then disappeared.   It was still daylight at that point but getting dark.  I then drove home which took me about 10 minutes & when I got settled into the house, my husband & daughter were looking outside towards Granger & the lights just reappeared around 6:30pm.   There were 2 of the large twinkling bright lights this time that hovered over the Granger, TX area for about 10-15 minutes.  We did capture them on videotape & you can have a copy of what we captured.   At times, 1 or 2 more lights would appear but for the majority of the time the 2 main lights stayed fairly motionless over the Granger area.  About an hour later helicopters or aircraft were flying very slowly in a circular pattern over where the sighting happened.;30.5708999999999;-97.4092999999996
