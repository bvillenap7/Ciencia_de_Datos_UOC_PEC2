ABOUT 30 SILVER DISC SHAPED OBJECTS;2008-08-07 15:00:00;10 MINUTES;ABOUT 30 SILVER DISC SHAPED OBJECTS I AM WRITING TO REPORT A UFO SIGHTING  IN THE TOWN OF INGLESIDE TX.   TIME WAS ABOUT 3PM.  I WAS  AT WORK AT GULF MARINE AT THE SOUTH YARD.  THIS COMPANY IS LOCATED NEAR INGLESIDE NEXT TO THE OCEAN.  I AND A CO-WORKER WERE FABBING UP MATERIAL FOR THE TAIHTI PROJECT WHICH IS AN OIL PLATFORM.  MY CO-WORKER DURING THE WORKING PROCESS ASKED ME TO PLEASE  LOOK UP.  AT FIRST I SAW NOTHING BUT AS I CONTINUED TO LOOK UP VERY HIGH INTO THE SKY I SAW WHAT LOOKED TO BE SEVERAL NUMBER WISE IM GOING TO SAY ABOUT 30 IN FORMATION.  THE COLOR WAS A DULL SILVER.  MOVING AS IF GLIDING.  I’VE HEARD ABOUT SIXTH SENSE AND I FELT AS IF SOMEONE WERE WATCHING US.  ME AND ALL MY CO-WORKERS.  IN A SPLIT SECOND THEY VANISHED.  THE SHAPE OF THESE OBJECTS WERE IN THE SHAPE OF HUBCAPS ON A VEHICLE OR A DISC.  I HEARD NO NOISE BUT THEN AGAIN THE WORK I WAS DOING WAS VERY LOUD.  MY DAUGHTER ALSO RECENTLY WITNESSED THE SAME OBJECTS BUT THIS WAS IN OUR BACKYARD IN INGLESIDE TX.  SHE DESCRIBED THE EXACT SAME OBJECTS THAT I HAD SEEN EXCEPT IT WAS A LOT LOWER AND MORE VISIBLE WITH NO SOUND WITH LIGHTS.  THE OBJECTS SHE DESCRIBED TO ME WERE WHITE.  THE OBJECT HOVERED ABOUT 100 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.  SHE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE OBJECTS I HAD SEEN AT THIS TIME.  MY DAUGHTER IS 11 YEARS OLD.  I AM 43 YEARS OF AGE.  THIS IS NOT A PRANK OR A JOKE.  THIS IS AN INCIDENT I FEEL THAT NEEDS TO BE REPORTED.  IN THIS TOWN OF INGLESIDE THERE IS A NAVY BASE IT COULD HAVE BEEN A MILITARY PLANE.  IF SO, I’VE NEVER SEEN ONE LIKE THIS AND I HAVE LIVED HERE ALMOST MY ENTIRE LIFE  THANK YOU ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));27.8673;-97.2118999999999
