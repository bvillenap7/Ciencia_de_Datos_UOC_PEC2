Red fireball light in night sky.;2012-12-07 20:00:00;2 minutes;red fireball light in night sky Last night while walking my dogs i saw a bright red fireball light above a neighbor's house.  It was stationary and extremely low.  It then started to move straight up about 300 ft. then just started drifting away until i could not see it for the tree's.  I went and got my car to follow the direction that it went.  I never got a visual on it again i took one picture on my phone but was to dark can see in picture sphere shape but too dark.;27.8673;-97.2118999999999
