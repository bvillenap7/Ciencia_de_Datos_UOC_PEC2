It was in complete focus hovering above a large tree nearby a farm road. It was Oval and slightly Saucer shaped with an array of multicolored lights, some lights were blinking in a sequence across and some in a circular motion, while others where strobing and some slightly plusating. Lights were colored red, green, yellow, blue and white. THe UFO remained Hovering as we proceded down the US HWY 59. I felt drawn to go to it but, the person I was with was too terrified to pursue it. I know what I saw was a genuine UFO. I have a strong background knowledge of aircraft being, that my father was a pilot and was in the USAF. I have been taught many things about aircraft from air shows to flying in helicopters over the Gulf of Mexico. If anyone else has seen this same type of UFO please post your sighting I waited 17 ! years to do it and I don't think I will ever forget it. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));28.3236;-98.1116
