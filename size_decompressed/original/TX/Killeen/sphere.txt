Large round object, maybe a little higher that it was wide. Hovering over  Northeast Fort Hood area (Fort Hood Air Field);1999-05-20 17:45:00;30 seconds;Large round object, maybe a little higher that it was wide. Hovering over  Northeast Fort Hood area (Fort Hood Air Field) On my way home from my Antique Radio shop. I was going toward Killeen city proper on Hwy 195. Object appeared to hover over the North end of Killeen, East end of Fort Hood, basically over the Fort Hood Airfield. It was daylight. Object was large, round, somewhat taller that it was wide. It appeared to be reddish silver, which could have been from the sun's reflection. It appeared to have something like portholes around the upper center of it. I had about a quarter of a mile to go to get home. I turned onto a side street and lost my view because of trees. When I could see the area again, it was gone. I have had three sightings, and all three have been over and around the Fort Hood are.;31.0755986074846;-97.7256723237596
Spherical object that emitted a blinding white light.;2003-10-25 22:00:00;3 seconds;Spherical object that emitted a blinding white light. My step dad was driving me home from my grandmother's when we stopped at red light. There was a field next to the road, and as I was looking out the window A sphere shaped object flew in from what I think was the south at an impossible speed. It stopped above the field a engulfed itself in a blinding white light, which lasted only a split second. It then flew off towards the east at the same speed it had arrived at the field. I was pretty young at the time, and I didn't want to tell anyone because when I told my step dad he just laughed. Toward the back of the field there was a stand of trees, and that's all that I can remember. I was terrified, and after I told my step dad, I was also very embarrassed. There is an airport near by, but this thing had no wings, it didn't make even the slightest sound, it had no visible engines, and it could accelerate, stop on a dime, and then go straight back to the speed that it was had been moving at before it stopped. It was roughly the size of a motorcycle. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));31.0755986074846;-97.7256723237596
