Odd occurance over Ft. Hood, Texas;1975-10-15 06:30:00;3-4 min.;Odd occurance over Ft. Hood, Texas I was living outside Ft. Hood, Texas in 1975, when I was awoken early by my roommate who was extremely anxious for me to go outside and observe what he noted in the sky, he didn't want to be the only one who saw it. The sun was aready all the way up in the sky without a cloud in sight.  A large white glowing orb was visible high over Ft. Hood and as we watched, the object split into four with the original remaining in the center but at a much smaller size, then as we continued to watch the four lights that had broken off split again into four complete lights and at this time all the separate lights took off in different directions at a high rate of speed.  The original light stayed just long enough for the others to disappear and then took off itself at a high rate of speed straight up. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
