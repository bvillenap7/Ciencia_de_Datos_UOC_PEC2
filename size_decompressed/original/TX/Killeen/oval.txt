Viewed from Backporch looking toward the northwest were 10 medium sized white lights that formed an oval shape that did nothing at first but later repeatedly flashed to other smaller lights near the center of the oval. Looked to be about 200 ft high and about 1/4 mile away. and about 300 feet diameter.It was completely silent. There was a light fog and no actual oval object could be seen only the shape formed by the lights. After viewing for 2 and half hours it ascended straight up. It never moved through the entire sighting until it left.;31.0755986074846;-97.7256723237596
Fast moving oval object observed just after dark in Texas;2002-08-20 21:00:00;10 seconds;Fast moving oval object observed just after dark in Texas While sitting on the patio, just after dark, I saw an object moving through the sky from north to south at a high rate of speed. The object appeared to be oval shaped and either silver or metallic blue in color. As the object moved it seemed to create a disturbance in the atmosphere or have an aura around itself. The object had no lights, left no trail, and did not make any sound. I lost sight of the object as it flew over our building, by the time I went around to the other side of our building to investigate, the object was gone.

Slow blinking white light on July 4th.;2009-07-04 22:00:00;about 5 minutes;Slow blinking white light on July 4th. My husband,daughter and myself drove to view the yearly Fourth of July fireworks display Fort Hood puts on.  We went about a mile away to the local newspaper building parking lot.  You can see very well from there and not get tangled up in the traffic down on the highway.  There was about 50 people scattered about the parking lot.  We sat our lawn chairs up and relaxed.  As the show started something kept catching my attention in the sky to the right of me. I looked at my husband and he said that yes, he's been watching it too.  No one else noticed.  They were all focused on the fireworks. It was stable in the sky flashing slow.  Then it started to move.  Very slowly at first.  Then after about 5 minutes it just shot away. I have lived in Killeen for about 35 years and I have seen all kinds of military aircraft and flares.  This was neither.  This is also not the first time for me to see things like this here.;31.0755986074846;-97.7256723237596
