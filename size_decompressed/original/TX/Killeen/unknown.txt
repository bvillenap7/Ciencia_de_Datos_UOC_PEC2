An Object In The Sky Over I-35 Texas in March of 1993.;1993-03-11 21:00:00;10 minutes;An Object In The Sky Over I-35 Texas in March of 1993. Like others, I just found this website. So I decided to look up a month I too saw something I could not explain.  On March 11, 1993, 2 friends and I were heading out for spring break, first to Austin, TX and then to South Padre Island. I looked at the reports for March 93 and found, I SAW 3 BLINKING / JUMPING LIGHTS FOR MORE THAN 3 HOURS. I can’t say it was the same object, however, I know it was the same stretch of highway and at about the same hour. Heading south from Fort Worth, TX, between Waco and Austin, we saw something in the sky that we cannot explain. I know, 13 years have pasted but this experience, I’ll never forget. We saw an object moving East to West at about 8:30 - 9:00 PM, a strange object with segment of lights blinking in a row. We first noticed it from a distance as it was moving from our left to right at a slow rate. Shortly after, we saw that other vehicles have pulled over on I-35 to watch this object in the sky. I-35 runs North and South, so the object appeared from the east and moved over I-35 to the West, it wasn’t moving very fast at all. Then from the South East, a huge bright light appeared, but that turned out to be a helicopter flying fast towards the direction of the object. When I look back to the object, it was nowhere in site. We know a helicopter in the sky, but we could never identify that object. This night has always been the strangest experience of my life.;31.0755986074846;-97.7256723237596
Red craft appearing directly above, maneuvering south, sw, w, then se, then fading.;2006-07-30 23:42:00;1 minute+;Red craft appearing directly above, maneuvering south, sw, w, then se, then fading. Craft initially appeared to move across the sky like 2 satellites moving in echelon formation across the sky, north to south, then both turned almost simultaneously to the southwest for a few seconds, then west for a few seconds, then southwest again for about 30 seconds, then they chnged to a southeasterly direction and faded out of visibility, NOT on the horizon.  During these maneuvers, the craft would change positions, one leading, then the other, closing distance between each other, then spreading out again.  Both craft appeared to glow constantly red, maintaining brightness similar to a satellite across the sky, until they faded from view.;31.0755986074846;-97.7256723237596

Colorful object hovering over Killeen Texas.;2013-09-08 06:15:00;30 minutes still going;Colorful object hovering over Killeen Texas Looked up at what I thought is a star only to see it change colors from white, blue, green, a d red then slowly move in a circle then stop and now looks to be slowly going right to left forward to backwards as the light gets closer and more distinguishable then further away.  Also, saw as many as four shooting stars at once pass by the light.  Just watched a plane out of Killeen regional airport fly past it, object appears to be very high in the sky.
