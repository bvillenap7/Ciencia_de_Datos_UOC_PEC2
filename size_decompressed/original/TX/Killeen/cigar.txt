I was driving my wife to work when suddenly I saw a bright silver cigar-shaped obejct come out of a large puffy cloud and enter a clear area of blue sky.  The object's brightness caught my eye and then after six or seven seconds, the object became darker and entered another large cloud, but it never came out through the other side, it simply did not come out.  Unfortunately my wife did not see the object in the beginning, but she did not see anything come out either.  Now, we live near a military area but this was no helicopter or airplane.  Maybe a weather balloon?;31.0755986074846;-97.7256723237596
