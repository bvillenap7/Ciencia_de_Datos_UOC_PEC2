Observered what i thought was a star but brightened considerably then disappears.  ((NUFORC Note:  Flare of Iridium satellite?  PD));2012-09-10 23:45:00;3-4 seconds;observered what i thought was a star but brightened considerably then disappears was outside looking north talking on phone just watching the stars was kinda hazy, some very light clouds, mostly lights from city, but was able to make out the big dipper other constellations, mostly, the brightest stars, when i looked i would say north north east about same height as big dipper there was two stars when all of as sudden one brightens 10 times what it was originally as far as i could tell, then disappears,  it did not move in relation to the other star was not flashing and did not observe it anywhere else,  Also reminded me of another time i was working late, was looking north again, i am  near FT Hood, and observe helicopters a lot, but this incident was different, it looked to be maybe a helicopter seem about where it should be but it was just a white light no other lights with it, no flashing lights, it was headed south coming towards me, when all of a sudden, just about right above me it veers up, speeds up, then all of a sudden in a matter of less than a second it was out there then it appeared to look like a star then just disappeared, i almost called 911 to report a helicopter down, but would have seen the smoke n crash because it would have been close to me, but it just disappeared, no other lights were around, thought maybe it had turned a different direction, but observed nothing. this happened about 5 years ago, probably not interested in it. And since i am writing also about 6 years ago was driving back from Lubbock just on the west side of Lampassas, late in the evening around, 7:30 8 summer heading east, it was kinda one of those cool evenings after a cloud passes rains a little so was very clear, when to the north observed a white ball of light at first thought it was a plane, but seeing how there was some hills in the background just by reasoning it would of have to have been bigger, plus a little different shape, then i guess with everybody you start trying to reason what it was, could it be a bird, no, from that distance it would have been a damn big bird, now i know things are bigger in texas but not that big, it was id say about compared to the hill in the distance, about 1-200 ft off the ground, it was headed west seemed to be going at a good clip, compared to the background then speed up and disappeared.;31.0755986074846;-97.7256723237596
