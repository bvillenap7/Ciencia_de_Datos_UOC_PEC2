Extremely bright light in sky, due East of Killeen, Fort Hood area.;1999-11-09 03:45:00;3 minutes;Extremely bright light in sky, due East of Killeen, Fort Hood area. This was an extremely large bright light sited in the Easterly sky from my vantage point, which was about 1 mile East of Fort Hood Tx. The light was about the size of my thumbnail at arms length. I watched it for about 3 minutes. It did not move during that time. However, I know it was not a star. I watch the sky all the time. It was not there the night before, and hasn't been there since. If I had to guess distance, I would say maybe 50 to 75 miles out. I am retired US Army, and this is the third such object that I have seen in the years.;31.0755986074846;-97.7256723237596
multicolor flashing light in the sky;2008-09-12 02:00:00;10+ mins;multicolor flashing light in the sky I saw a light in the east north east sky. i saw a light that was flashing red, orange, blue, green, white, and yellow at what looked to be some kind of sequence. it was nearly impossible to tell the distance of the object but it was very high up and there were clouds that passed in front. The lights seemed to circle the object. I'm not sure if it was my eyes playing tricks on me but it also seemed like small rays of light were coming off of, what i was almost making out to be, the corners of the object like it was surveying or scanning. i was only able to watch it for a short while before i became unnerved.;31.0755986074846;-97.7256723237596
Bright aura surrounding and moving with UFO. Killeen, TX.;2012-10-08 19:20:00;8 minutes;Bright aura surrounding and moving with UFO. Killeen, TX. Large, flat, bright, auras that moved about slowly. Directly over Fort Hood, Texas.  There were several very long jet vapor trails in the sky which provided great differentiation.  These trails seemed to be all around the craft and moved up and down with it.  The trails were bright and distinct. One went up slightly then light and trail just vanished.  The other 7 disappeared behind trees.  A jet flew around our location about a mile from us just over the trees and the jet made no sound at all.;31.0755986074846;-97.7256723237596
Clear sky, Venus was bright but then I saw two lights in the sky little brighter than;2020-02-13 18:50:00;3 minutes;I stepped out the house to check how cold it was, clear sky, Venus was bright, but then I saw two lights in the sky little brighter than the rest with a distance between them.  While looking at them I thought that the rotation of the earth was a little faster than ever because there was a movement of the “stars” where unusual, then both “stars” dim itself and disappear.;31.0755986074846;-97.7256723237596
