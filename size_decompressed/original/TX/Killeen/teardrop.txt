My father was setting up his telescope to start his weekend sky watch hobby when he called everyone outside to look at something that was flying over our house.  We live in the South part of Killeen, Texas and we usually see military and civilian aircraft fly over our house all the time, but this thing that flew over our house was a size of a 747 at is was about 750 feet to 800 feet in the air, their was no noise and no navigational lights.  Then when it started to get over a populated area, the light just blinked out, you could still see the shape of the object, but it was very vague.  It looked like a tear shape object with not red or green navigational lights.;31.0755986074846;-97.7256723237596
