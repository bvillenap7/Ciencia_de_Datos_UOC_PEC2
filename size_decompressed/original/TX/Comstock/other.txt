I saw no flying object.;2002-03-30 20:30:00;unknown;I saw no flying object. I was lost in the desert of Texas having suffered from severe dehydration.  I disappeared at about 3:00pm.  At about 8:30 when the moon rose, beings approached me: my mother, grandmother, and a friend that had died and some others I didn't recognize.  They talked to me for awhile.  At one point I woke up lying on the ground in the nude.  My memory is very hazy since I was suffering from dehydration.  I would have thought I had dreamed it all except my shirt was wrong side out the next morning.  I found my way to my RV by 12:30 am on March 31.  I had traversed at least two miles barefoot and was relatively unscathed except for cactus spines in my feet.;29.7484;-101.2628
