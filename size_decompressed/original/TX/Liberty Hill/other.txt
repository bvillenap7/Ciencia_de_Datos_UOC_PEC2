Bright Lights over Williamson County, Tx.;2008-01-08 19:20:00;21 minutes;Bright Lights over Williamson County, Tx. I first wanna say that there are many sightings being reported that are probably farce. I have been a police officer for 17 yrs, have seen many extraordinary things, but I am still in shock over what my 2 sons and I witnessed.   On the 8th of January, 2008, at approximately 1920 hrs. I went outside to gather some firewood, looked across my property which sits on a hill facing the northeast, with a view of approximately 8-10 miles.  I noticed these extremely bright orange or flame colored lights rising 300-500 feet above the horizon.   The lights were horizontally aligned and spanned an area quite wide.  I noticed they would disappear for a few seconds and would appear again at different heights as if they were in sporadic rows.  The lights would come and go in various numbers ranging from as little as two and as many as 12.  I became intrigued with the lights and called my 15 yo son as well as my 18 yo son to come outside and view them. I suggested to my sons that it might possibly be a fire off in the distance, but recanted as the lights progressively reached greater heights.  I went as far as calling the Williamson County Sheriffs Office to see if a fire or something of  that  nature had been reported in the area of the lights.  This call was documented and a Deputy was sent to check the area around 1941 hrs.  We attempted to get photos of the lights but where unable.  The lights disappeared shortly after the call to Williamson County S.O.  I would like to re-iterate the size and brightness of the object rivals nothing of man-made proportions, and my 2 sons could somewhat compare the brightness to the oil drilling rigs you see far offshore in the Gulf of Mexico.  Thanks for your time and I hope this helps in your investigations.....;30.6622;-97.9310000000002
