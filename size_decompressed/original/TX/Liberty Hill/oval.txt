solid red light aircraft;2007-02-06 20:45:00;2 min;solid red light aircraft I just spotted a aircraft flying over Austin TX traveling NW which is a normal route for air traffic. The lights on the air craft were not strobes, and according to the FAA every air craft must have a strobe. The light configuration was red light (very bright) in the rear. and a very dim greenish white light in the front. I tracked the craft with a 90mm telescope and could not see an outline of the craft or reflections of the lights on the crafts body. There was an air distortion with an elongated oval shape with sharp points where the lights are from the profile view of the craft. The craft transited the sky at what appeared to be average aircraft speed. It maintained speed and heading through out the entire time. The odd;30.6622;-97.9310000000002
