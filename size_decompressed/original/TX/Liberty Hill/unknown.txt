Bright Orange lights appear and reappear;2008-01-08 22:00:00;1 hour;Bright Orange lights appear and reappear On the night of January 8th, my step dad, my little brother and I saw 4 bright burning orange lights toward the north.  The lights were just above the ground and appeared to be 5 to 6 miles away. At first we thought it was a fire because of the glow beneath it so my step dad who is a police officer called the dispatch to see if any calls have came in about a fire. The dispatcher said none have come in. We knew it wasn’t a fire when the lights came towards the ground and disappeared. Approximately 5 minutes later the light would come back up again into the sky where they would hover for another 15 minutes.  They repeated this process for about an hour. We were positive that they weren’t flares, planes, towers, or helicopters. The largest army Base Fort Hood is north of where our house is and the lights were in that direction.  So we might have thought it was some kind of military operation. We have never seen anything like this and what interested us more were the reports that came in a week later on the news.;30.6622;-97.9310000000002
