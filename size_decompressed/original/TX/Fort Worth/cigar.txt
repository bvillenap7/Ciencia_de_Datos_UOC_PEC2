weird plane;2003-08-22 21:15:00;aprx. 3 mins;weird plane I am not saying that i saw an alien ship, but i am saying that i did see something very clear in the sky that i certianly couldnt identify. Myself and my younger brother were driving to the local movie rental store, we live in a pretty rural area so there werent that many other cars on the road. i was driving ast a local highschool and on the opposite side of the school there is a field. a very bright white light caught my eye, and i wasnt sure what it was i had never seen a light there before. i thought that maybe there was a stadium light in the field, because thats how bright it was. then it began t move, so naturally i figured it was a plane. then my younger brother said , wow thats a weird looking plane. i turned and looked agian and there were more than grren and red lights, like on a plane, and  te closer i looked at it , the les it was shaped like a plane, but more cigar shaped, and there was a very brightwhite light and a purple glow like i had never seen before. so naturaly i picked up my cell phone to call my mom to tell her what we had just seen, but my cell hone had no service. i drive on that road every day, i have never had recepetion problems on that road before. and thats my story;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293

Noticed something very bright reflecting the sun.;2016-10-26 17:30:00;10 seconds;My husband and I were driving back to the hotel we are staying in here in Fort Worth Texas.  We just finished dinner.  It was approximately 5:30 pm and we were on hwy 170.  I was in the passenger seat and we were driving into the very bright afternoon sun.  I looked at my husband while we were talking and noticed something very bright reflecting the sun in the sky out his window past his head.  It was reflecting just like a mirror, it made me want to squint.  It seemed to me it was reflecting the bright sunlight.  It was hovering above a field- completely still in the sky.  I said What is that? but he couldn't take his eyes off the road to look because of heavy traffic.  I leaned towards him trying to see around him.  I saw it go to plain grey metal color and I could tell it was shaped like a bar.  It was completely still in the sky.  No movement at all.  I kept leaning around him and trying to re-adjust myself to keep it in view and then suddenly, it was gone, as if it had just disappeared.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
