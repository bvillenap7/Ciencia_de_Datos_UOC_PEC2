All of a sudden it just disappeared and then a small plane with a contrail behind it flew in the approximate location of the object. I am a 53 year old female, wife, mother, grandmother and a Christian.  I have no history of mental illness and no criminal history.  I was driving east in SW Fort Worth on Old Grandbury Road and almost to the intersection of Hulen when I looked in front of me in the sky slightly south and noticed a cylinder shaped silver object.  I thought it was a plane but all of a sudden it disappeared before my eyes.  I looked all around in the sky but it was gone.  A second later a small plane flew in the same area with a contrail behind it.  My sister and I had a extrodinary sighting 25 years ago and for some reason we never reported it or told very many people about it and in fact forgot about it almost instantly until about 5 years ago.  This time I want to make sure it is reported and if it was a plane thats fine but still I have very large doubts since it was gone in an instant.  Can you please let me know if anyone else saw anything odd today?;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
Me and a friend of mine were driving down Alemeda St between Westpoint Blvd and Academy Blvd when we saw an orange orb in the sky. Once;2013-10-16 20:57:00;3 minutes;Me and a friend of mine were driving down Alemeda St between Westpoint Blvd and Academy Blvd when we saw an orange orb in the sky.   Once we stopped, the orb started moving south and slowly went dark.  Once it was dark we could see it was some sort of craft that was tubular and black.  It was completely soundless and very smooth in its movements.   As it was moving south it would slowly spin but kept moving in a straight line.  It stopped near the I-30 and I-820 interchange and hovered there for a few seconds and then flew west at a very high rate of speed and still made no sound.   We tried to find it again, but we were unsuccessful.  I tried to take a video with my cell phone, but nothing can be seen but the night sky and moon.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
