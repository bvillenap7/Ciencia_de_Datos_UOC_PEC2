large football field size craft in Eluess Texas 1982;1982-06-01 00:00:00;a few minutes;large football field size craft in Eluess Texas 1982 I was five or six years old at the time. A friend of mine and his dad were coming back from the Bellaire movie theater in Euless. during the drive home we saw a long line of cars on what seemed to be a back road that we were on. all of the cars were stopped as well as ours. Just to the left of us and all of the other cars was a huge oval shaped craft about the size of a football field. it was covered in lights and moving extremely slow. it looked to be a hundred feet off the ground. it was so long ago that i cannot remember what happened after that. I know there were alot of other cars there that were watching the same thing. Im twenty five years old now and have tried to find anything in the old news papers relating to the incident at that time. It happened during the time Tron was in theaters.Upon asking my friend about it years later he acted strange and avoided the question. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We would welcome other reports, or any newspaper articles, about the sighting.  PD));32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
Craft with intense white light;2008-05-02 21:00:00;2 min;Craft with intense white light I was out in the backyard on the phone and happened to locate what I thought was a star, moving at a speed faster than an airliner. It came from the northwest traveling to southeast.  As I was about to lose sight , it suddenly turned into an intense white light for about 10 seconds, almost like a spotlight and then dimmed back to its original star appearance. It could have been a satellite, but I have never seen an intense light come from one like that before.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
2 low flying crafts 400 yards high, no sounds of engines.;2011-04-18 23:00:00;5-10 seconds;2 low flying crafts 400 yards high, no sounds of engines. Walked out side to look at stars within 20 seconds of being outside I saw 2 objects flying overhead at about 400 yards high, I did not hear any sounds of an engine.   I live by a Navy Airbase and Lockheed Martin so I am used to hearing planes fly over esp when flying that low to the ground.   The 2 objects curved off at about the same speed as a helicopter maybe faster, other possibility are it could have been a Navy UAV but they dont usally fly that low it seemed like the objects wanted to be low to the ground for some sort of Recon ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be wrong.  We have changed it to reflect a date in 2011.  PD));32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
Orange ball stationary in sky above neighborhood south of Fort Worth before leaving northbound.;2014-01-01 00:47:00;2 minutes;Orange ball stationary in sky above neighborhood south of Fort Worth before leaving northbound While driving northbound out of the Carson Ranch estates, north of Crowley and south of Fort Worth TX, my daughter and I observed an orange light or “thing” floating completely motionless above the neighborhood at an altitude of what I perceived to be between 50 and 100 ft.  It seemed to appear out of nowhere. The sky was clear. At first we thought it was some kind of flaring firework because people had been setting off fireworks in the area as the New Year began 45 minutes prior.  We were baffled that this “firework” was suspended motionless in the air as we were driving past it.  It was more baffling that, upon further observation, the light appeared to be an illuminated, orange ball hovering in the sky.  It did not appear perfectly round like a sphere but, rather, it looked more ecliptic or egg shaped.  The object was to the right, or east, of us by a perceived 200 or 300 meters away.  After looking at it for about 15 or 20 seconds as we were driving by, the object suddenly started moving!  It travelled northward.  Neither my daughter nor I heard any noise emanating from it. With my curiosity peaked, I proceeded to “chase” the object and turned eastbound as it continued northbound, east of us.  The object appeared to start accelerating and gaining altitude as I drove under its path of flight.  At this point, I got my phone camera rolling. I turned northbound at the next street.  However, the object was now going too fast to catch up while driving down residential roads.  I stopped my car and continued filming for a few more seconds until it was too far and faint for the camera to pick up anymore.  However, I could still see it with my eyes as it changed its heading from north to northeast.  I could tell that it changed course by using a street light as a reference point. As the object was moving, its illumination had a slow, subtle pulse to it in about 2 or 3 second intervals, from bright to dim then bright again, repeatedly.  The pulsing was very subtle and not immediately obvious. This was NO Chinese lantern!  It had started moving from its initial stationary position much too quickly. It was not windy 5 mph at the most.  This also had too much range and speed to be a remote controlled helicopter.  If it was a drone or UAV, why would it be illuminated orange as a whole?  And why so low?  I am very curious as to what this object could have been.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293

Fleet of 20-40 ufos descended on house, stayed long enough for my family too see them, came way down and then left;2021-02-05 19:00:00;5 minutes;Fleet of 20-40 ufos descended on house, stayed long enough for my family too see them, came way down and then left Was in my back yard with my sister and Al of these hovering silent craft descended on my neighborhood right above my house anywhere from 300-500 yards up. We were staring at them when one came down to about 100 yards from the ground so we could see it perfectly and their were three large lights one red one green one blue that looked like square grids each in a line on the bottom of a silver oval shaped craft. Then they all flew off after about 5-6 minutes. My entire family had time to come out and see otherwise I’d be checking myself in somewhere.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
