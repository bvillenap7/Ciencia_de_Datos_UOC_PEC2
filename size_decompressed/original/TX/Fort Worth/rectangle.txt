White rectangle object crossed over moon, visible through telescope.;2018-01-24 16:05:00;4 seconds;White rectangle object crossed over moon, visible through telescope. At 16:05 local time, viewing moon through 130mm reflector telescope, 25mm wide angle eye piece being used.  A white rectangle object crossed my field of view for roughly 4 seconds, travelling on east to west trajectory.  Appeared, cut right across the moon, then disappeared from sight.  Checked satellite database, nothing on that path in area, no aircraft in area, white rectangle object wasn't visible at all to naked eye.  Have researched, but no satellites compare to what this object was.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
Saw a vertical rectangle, looked like a lower case letter i, move across the sky.

Stepped out of my garage and over the neighbors trees I saw a rectangular object moving across the sky.  It caught my eye because it looked almost like a lower case I moving over the trees.  Appeared to be heading in a south/southwesterly direction and seemed to be 1/4 to 1/2 mile away.  Had my 14 year old daughter come out because it looked so weird and neither of us could figure out what it was.  Watched it continue on until it was hidden behind trees.  Neither of us had our phones to take a picture.  It was still pretty light outside.  Didn't see any lights on the object.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
