Colorful and bright huge objects in sky.;2010-01-08 19:00:00;20 minutes;Colorful and bright huge objects in sky. At first I only noticed one object with very colorful and bright lights (red, green, blue, orange) shimmering rapidly from the object about 20 miles away in the sky from where I was looking, which was Southwest bound from Bedford, TX to Fort Worth. Then I saw another identical one  appear and slowly hover away.   No news reports as of yet to see what these things were.  I want to know!

Large grey UFO flies with no sound;2012-04-22 00:15:00;15 seconds;Large grey UFO flies with no sound I was sitting out in my backyard, watching the meteor shower we were having. If my eyes had not been fixed on the sky, I would have missed it.  The UFO was a Grey color, almost blending into the sky behind it. It was a strange shape, and it was flying pretty low (I can't say how many feet).   What struck me was the fact that there were no lights and it made absolutely no sound as it was flying. I honestly couldn't believe what I was seeing.  I have never reported anything like this before, and felt really silly telling my friend who was on the phone what was happening to me, but I've never seen anything like that before.  It was unbelievable. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293

And I'm looking in the sky  and something caught my attention.  White I saw the color solid white.  And I see what I think is a big bird like and owl.  I'm watching this thing flying but only in a downward circle.  Every couple of downward descents that it made it flaw its wings but only once kind of like a glider then flap and it shine a shiny spot like when the sun is shining and the lite reflects it.  I looked away for 3 seconds and it completely disappeared.  It was gone .;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
