When I originally saw it in the sky, the diamonds were closely clumped together (but not exactly touching), and under the flight track of Alliance airport, under 500ft. * *   * * * * As the 767 cleared the craft above the entity, it floated into 6 distinct entities and began moving to the west/west-north and rising. The 6 entities expanded - 3 of them straight and uniform at the horizon, 3 of them connected to the left-side point and connected as a triangle. At this point, it was stable at 3000ft. * * * *    *    * As it continued west, the entities expanded their space and changed the overall shape into a straight-line. It moved slightly higher, stable at 6000ft. I continued watching the entities until it moved out of my sight to the west. *    *    *    *    *    *;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
