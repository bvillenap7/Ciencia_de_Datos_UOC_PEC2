Camping in a back yard with a friend, a creature looked into the tent at us, at which point hours were lost.;1976-06-15 22:00:00;Unknown;Camping in a back yard with a friend, a creature looked into the tent at us, at which point hours were lost. I was approximately 11 years old, staying overnight at a friend's house, camping out in his back yard.  My friend had fallen asleep quite suddenly, and I heard what sounded like an animal shuffling around in the grass outside of the tent.  Normally this would not have scared me, but for whatever reason, it did, just then.  I turned and looked at the screen in the tent flap and saw a head, shaped roughly like a football on its side, looking in at us in the darkness.  It realized I was looking and quickly dropped out of sight.   At this point I did what any normal person would do - I covered my head.  I looked out a couple of minutes later (so I thought) to find it was mid-morning.  My friend was still asleep, and I was thoroughly confused.   I have no idea what I saw that night, and no idea what happened in the time from covering my head to the next morning.  Again, it seemed like a couple of minutes, but was actually hours.

This happened years ago, but it is something that I will never forget. I was about 19 years old at the time. My boyfriend (at that time) and I were sitting inside the car in front of my mother's house talking. It was dark outside and we had not been drinking and did not do drugs. It was probably between the hours of 8:30-9:30 PM. In the sky there was an object with lights that I have never seen on any airplane, helicopter, or anything else for that matter. The lights were like those that you would see on a kaleidoscope. The lights faded in and out of each other, kinda like they were blending into each other as the lights chased around the UFO. The craft hovered in one spot, I didn't notice any movement at all. I have never seen any aircraft stand so still in mid- air. This lasted for about a couple of minutes, and then the object took off with a speed that I have never seen. It was there one second and gone the next, If I would have blinked I would have missed it take off. There was no sound at all. I remember going inside to watch the 10:00 news to see if anything would be on there about the incident, there wasn't. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It was west of our location towards Fort Worth NAS. I heard no boom, no noise at all. It looked close, but there were no landmarks to judge the distance. May have been a meteor, but I have never seen one quite so bright nor vibrant.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
white object between Ft Worth and Dallas;2004-07-23 15:30:00;seconds;white object between Ft Worth and Dallas As I was driving eastbound, from Fort Worth to Dallas, almost directly in front of me, I saw just for maybe two seconds, a white, possibly round object, dissappear into a cloud. There are a lot of military aircraft in the area, so it seems like I'm always looking up. I watched the cloud, nothing came out.? Bear in mind, I was driving,probably about 30 mph, so I had to keep one eye on the road. Usually military, and some commercial aircraft,I would have heard, but I heard nothing. I pulled over. I watched the cloud for ten minutes. Nothing came out. I wear glasses,so I'm not above saying I could have been mistaken. It just seemed so clear. The sky was clear with white clouds on a blue sky. What I call a Simpson sky. I don' have the ability to judge the distance of a cloud, but if I had to guess I would guess ten miles away. I just came directly in and entered ufoon my computer to see if maybe someone else saw it.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293

It was high enough to look like a star at first but the thing changed directions, stopped and then started back east fast.  Just happend to be looking up and am wondering if it could have been the space station?  I have never done anything like this but it freaked me out enough to find out more.

Blue & Red Orbs Merge & Vanish.;2014-07-21 21:30:00;~5 seconds;Blue & Red Orbs Merge & Vanish I do not know what I saw.  It was gone as fast as I saw it.   All I can say for certain is a blue orb, and a red orb on the west horizon seemed to collide, with no sound, or explosion.   It happened very fast as the two objected merged, and quickly disappeared.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
Bright white object moved across binocular field of view.  No collision lights.  ((anonymous report));2018-06-08 21:45:00;14 seconds;Bright white object moved across binocular field of view.  No collision lights. At approximately 9:45pm CDT, I was observing Jupiter with a pair of Celestron Astronomy binoculars.  An extremely bright object passed rapidly across my field of vision.  I lowered the binoculars and saw it was not visible to the naked eye. The object did not display any ant-collision lights used by aircraft.  The direction of travel was north to south.

At times some were visible, at other times they would disappear, and other noes would become visible. the weather was mostly clear and I was able to get a few photos, although none are very clear. I have worked on aircraft most of my life and these did not appear to be conventional planes. Planes flying together normally fly in some sort of formation rather than a loose random group. There was no order to their group. They continued flying South at what appeared to be a cruise speed, not in any hurry, until I lost sight of them.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
