100 orbs over Jacksboro golf course.;2015-04-16 20:00:00;1 hour;100 orbs over Jacksboro golf course I was staying at valley motel room 24 on the end, went out side to smoke a cigarette so a blinking light floating towards the road got phone camera, started first video on on side of Jacksboro high to film the one when I noticed as it went across the street there were a lot more, one man walking across street, asked him what those were, he said satellites and he didn't know and walked off, filmed the on it stayed hovered above street light, half way there 12 min video I got a chance to run across street film other half.  I only filmed there that long because I was being yelled at by manager asking what I was doing, I said you don't see them.  Poor old man couldn't.  He made me go in.   I tried to upload video but it was to big by mobile so I went back out and saw took small couple second video and 3 stills. the manager said the police were called because I was in the street, I went in side.  It was about 20 mins before the police came and the video is not the best!  I was worried I was going to jail and looked over the officers there were 2 shoulders and saw one, and said look see it. and they did. the put in report I was looking at night sky. They left and I watched in the door for about 10 more mins manager made me go back in. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmRJi7faBQk;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
