Two odd fireballs moving slowly, silently in daytime;1976-06-06 16:00:00;30 Minutes;Two odd fireballs moving slowly, silently in daytime We saw two fireballs moving slowly and silently across the afternoon, clear blue sky. They were yellow, appeared to be made of moving flame, appeared to be about 1/10 the size of the moon or less.  They were about 60 degrees elevated. Both seemed to have tails behind them (opposite the direction of their movement) which were very small and appeared to have a candle or flame at the end, pointed upwards. They were seen by my family (5 persons) and neighbors (2+ persons). ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
green fireball coming down changing colors;1998-09-23 21:05:00;3-4 seconds;green fireball coming down changing colors Im retired Police 52 yrs. old. I was sitting outside in Weatherford Texas facing towards the west towards Fort Worth when I saw a bright white light coming straight down in the direction of Fort Worth. It changed to green and had a long green tail. It then changed to white and then back to green. The tail stayed the same color at all times. It finally seemed to slow down then just blinked out.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293

Me and two friends were in the drive through of Whater burger waiting for our order. I was in the drivers seat. All of a sudden I noticed to orange lights rising up from behind some trees in the distance. My first reaction was someone must have set off a couple of flares. Then I watched to see if they were going to fall like flares do but they didn't. They slowly ascended up at an angle like planes do on take off. I then said oh shit and told my homeboys look at this shit. Then we all jumped out the truck to get a better look. I noticed that the two lights were independent of each other because of the irregular patterns that they were doing. They were definately flying with each other though. They made no noise at all. Sky was very clear. It seems like they got to a certain point in the sky and kind of stood there hovering. It seems that one of them was kind of bouncing and doing some out the ordinary movements. By this time, we were causing so much commotion that a couple of employess took notice. I remember two gentlemen sitting in a truck in front of Whater Burger as well watching this. Then they got smaller and eventually faded. They definately were not airplanes or helicopters because they didnt have the usual lights that those craft would have. There's no airport in that area in which it seems they arose from. Just neighborhoods. One of my homeboys described them as being like embers from a fire that kind of hovers as they get caught in the heat waves. This is definately something I probably wont forget. I dont  drink or smoke so I was in my right frame of mind.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293

A few seconds after lighting it, I looked over to the North and saw three glowing orange orbs in the sky. I immediately yelled for my husband to come outside. He came out and saw all three in the sky.  He went back in the house to find the video camera but couldn't locate it.  When he returned outside two of them had dissapeared.   We watched as the third and finale one slowly seemed to burn out and turn into a small silver speck in the night sky.  The three objects where heading from the Nort to a East by Southeast direction.  There where two other airplanes in the area shortly after the UFO's where gone.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293

I was facing a closed window in our room and the window has a brown shade over it.  However, I noticed a red ball of light on the inside that quickly passed through the shade and window and disappeared, either moving away or dissolving on the outside of our house. I just read a ton about ball lightning, but I doubt ball lightning inspects people or their houses when people are sleeping. It sounds more like a monitoring tool of some sort.  I remembered watching UFO reports about balls of red light floating over houses and fields.  And I wonder if this is one of them.  Anyone else experience something like this?   I can only hope that if it is a monitoring tool, that we didn't show any reason for further interest in us!  Haven't been able to get back to sleep yet for the past hour and a half.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
