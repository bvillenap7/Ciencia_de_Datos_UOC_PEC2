CUBE SHAPE OBECT SIGHTED IN FORT WORTH TX SEP 20;2020-09-27 19:50:00;2 min;CUBE SHAPE OBECT SIGHTED IN FORT WORTH TX SEP 20 On approximately 29 September, 2020, at approximately 19:50 hrs., while taking an evening walk I happened to look over the nearby tree line and observed an object approximately 2-4 square ft. in diameter, emitting no sound, at a level approximately 2-300 ft. distant traveling at approximately 20 mph in a straight line the wind was negligible the object was cube in shape, off-white in color, no windows/portals were visible nor other appendages.  I opine that the object was likely an experimental vehicle as it was close to, and headed in the direction of a Military base/Lockheed manufacturing plant.  I believe this was the same type of vehicle as observed/reported by an individual (Benbrook, TX) on  14 Mar 20, and reported on this site on 15 May 20.  For background: I am retired military.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
