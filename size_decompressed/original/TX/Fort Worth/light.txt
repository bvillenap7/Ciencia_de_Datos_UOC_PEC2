UFO manuevering over an uninterested Carswell Air Force Base;1978-05-06 00:00:00;20:00;UFO manuevering over an uninterested Carswell Air Force Base Two friends and I were at Lake Worth late at night near Fort Worth, TX sometime back in the late '70s or early '80s.  I happend to see a star move.  It looked like any other star.  It wasn't the brightes and it wasn't the dimmest.  It moved in a circular pattern that is it quickly (about 1/2 second) made one circle with a diameter of about 3/4 (using my fingers at arms length to measure this and the following apparent distances), and then remained motionless for several minutes.  I didn't say anything because I felt that if it didn't move again my friends might pass it off as an eye movement. It finally moved again, this time it moved in a straight line about 4 apparent inches accross the sky.  There was no appearance of accelleration or decelleration just a quick move.  It then sat motionless again for a few minutes.  It made another circle, and one of my friend said, Did anybody see thst?  I said that I've been watching it.  It behaved this way for quite some time, making circles and straight lines, and remaining motionless for minutes between moves.  The circles all seemed to be the same size, but the length of the lines varied from about 4 to about 18.  It always looked like a star: no flashing or colored lights, and it always held the same brightness.  The last time we saw it is when it disappeared into the sky (or over the horizon) with a long, straight-line dash.  There it was, and then darted off, out of sight in about a second or less.  What I find interesting about this is WHERE it occurred.  It was directly over what at that time was Carswell AFB.  From where we were sitting, if there was any ground activity on base, we could have seen it.  We saw no military activity.  Not on the ground, not in the air.  This is a place to report not to speculate, but I can't help myself :) I'm now under the impression that thing was being operated by our Air Force. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

A bright blinding light followed me for Several miles;1989-03-01 01:30:00;20-25 Minutes;A bright blinding light followed me for Several miles I live in a suburb of Fort Worth, Texas and at the time I was living on a fairly rural road by Lake Worth lake and I was driving a '74 Chevy Blazer with limo tinted windows in the rear, anyway I was dating a young lady who lived off a road called 9 mile bridge road which was out in the less developed rural area, I had taken her home for the night and was on my way back to my house at the time (it was about 1:30 a.m.) when I noticed a light in the upper right hand corner of my mirror. Now, 9 mile bridge is a very curvy road with no street lights and all houses set back at least 50 yards, not to mention that the street is lined with woods and trees all the way down. Anyhow, I saw the light in the mirror and at first thought it was a street light so I looked back and noticed there was not a street light or a house light anywhere on the road. I was going 45 down the road and I kept a watch on the light which didn't seem to move until I got to an S turn on the road. As I made the turn I looked in the mirror, the light was gone. Then all of a sudden, it came back in the same area, well I had one more turn so I watched and it did the same thing. Then I came to a major highway (Hwy.199) and proceeded to get on it to get home and when I got on 199 I looked in the mirror and it was gone. So I traveled about 4 miles to the road I lived on and as soon as I was on that road the object was back and it followed me all the way back to my house (about 3/4 mile).I turned in my driveway and pulled up to my garage (my house is set about 100 yards off the road with nothing but woods all around it)and I always back my Blazer up so I wouldn't have to turn around the next morning, and just as I got finished parking, there was a bright light that came over. It was so bright that it blinded me to the point that I couldn't see anything around me, but there was not a sound, and the light was gone as it lit up the area. Now trust me, I was working security at the time and always carried a Glock 10mm with 170 grain jacketed hollo! w points with me, so I was well protected. After the light, it was all I could do to get in the house. I was so scared and when I came in I was running from window to window looking out with my gun in hand. My roommate said he had never seen me so scared in all the years he knew me. I couldn't sleep at all that night and can remember every little detail to this day as of 3/29/2000. That was over 10 years ago. Now I'm not saying that anyone has to believe in UFO's but I know my experience and that's enough for me,;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
The flickering object had a smaller object moving in and out of it .;1993-09-15 22:00:00;2 hours;The flickering object had a smaller object moving in and out of it . On or about 9/93 I went outside to enjoy the cool night time surroundings . I lived in Everman at the time and our house faced West towards I.35 . The sky was very clear , and when I looked in the sky I saw a bright light (star like) but brighter . I thought it was a aircraft at first but it never moved . Then all of a sudden it began to move from side to side and moving in an assortment of different angles very quickly . I knew at that time that this was not an airplane nor helicopter , because I worked in the Navy during night and day Aircraft Recovery and refueling . So I've seen too many Aircrafts at night to know this was not a commercial or military object . When it began to move , but it stayed in the same location . I went inside my house and got my wife . I told her to come with me outside , that I wanted for her to tell me what she could see in the Sky . She went outside with me and looked in the sky and seen the bright object and it began to move rapidly again . She grabbed me and we both looked at each other in amazement and began to talk about it to one another . After about 30 min. my wife got scared and went inside the house , I stayed outside and watched it move and stop moving . And it also flickered and changed colors , to a red and white flicker . I then noticed another bright object NorthWest of it and it began to flicker as well . And when I looked back at the first object it started to flicker really fast and I started seeing beams of light come from underneath the object and a smaller object moving out of it and then entering back inside . That scared me because it was very vivid , so I ran inside my house . My wife asked me was it still there and I told her Yes , and what it began to do . We both looked out the front window of my house in fear . We went back outside because I had to see this thing again to make sure that it was real . It was still there in the same location and moved very slowly from one angle to another . And than it began to move I thought , but! it would fade out then it would get bright again . It did that for about 10 min. and it faded out completely . This began at 10pm and was over around 12am . My wife and I remember this like it happened just yesterday . We could not go to sleep that night and I called a  local T.V. news  station to see if there were any reports of strange lights in the sky in or about my area . They told me No . But my wife and I know what we saw and it took alot of time for us to calm down . And we also called the Everman P.D. to no avail . We have told no one but my son . We do not like to watch any UFO programs , because it brings back what we saw that night too vivid . And we know in our heart and eyes what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Red light that flew almost horizonally then suddenly fell from the sky.;2003-09-16 22:15:00;2 minutes;Red light that flew almost horizonally then suddenly fell from the sky. I don't know if this qualifies or not, I started second guessing myself after I saw it, but I thought I would send it in. Maybe you have heard this before!! I was on my way to work(I'm a police officer), traveling on a major freeway(I-30 just west of Ft Worth, TX), when I spotted this red light. It was almost like a helicopter or plane light, but it never blinked. It was a solid red light for about 2 or 3 minutes. It was flying at an angle as if it was taking off. I feel it was flying too slow to be an airplane. It continued flying at this angle for a minute or two, slowly, then all of the sudden it took a dive!! The solid red light just fell from the sky. I kept watching to see if it had been a plane crash or something, but nothing ever happened. I never heard of anything on the news, and have never seen anything like this again. I should also tell you that this was just south of an Air Force Base. This is why I was second guessing myself. I guess it could have been a Top Secret aircraft the military is developing, but I don't know??? ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.  PD));32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
Three lights in form of triangle in sky west of Fort Worth disappeared completely. Two were brilliant white & one orange.;2004-12-11 21:50:00;1 minute;Three lights in form of triangle in sky west of Fort Worth disappeared completely. Two were brilliant white & one orange. As I was driving west-bound at approximately 9:50pm, December 11, 2004, I noticed two bright lights next to each other straight ahead that were increasingly getting brighter.  A third light was directly between and a little above to two brighter lights.  The three lights were in a formation of an acute triangle from my perspective.  At first I thought it must be a very large aircraft approaching in my direction.  However, upon further observation, there was absolutely no movement among the three lights.  The two brightest lights were brighter in magnitude than any star in the sky.  They were exactly side-by-side of each other.  The magnitudes of those two lights were even brighter than the star Sirius (which was in the sky that night to the east) and about as bright as Venus sometimes appears.  The two brightest lights had an equal magnitude.  Those two lights slowly faded to nothing over a span of about 5 to 10 seconds, again with no movement.  The dimmer third light, which had an orange tint, remained for a few seconds then faded to nothing as well.    The lights never reappeared.  The sky was clear and only slightly hazy to the north, but stars were still visible above and around the area in which the lights appeared.  I saw no clouds in the area at the time, although I had observed a few thin clouds in the sky to the east about an hour earlier that evening.  I observed the sky for several minutes after the lights disappeared and never saw a reemergence of the lights.  My located was south of Fort Worth, TX and north of Crowley, TX while observing the lights to the west.  I could not tell how far away the lights were due to the lack of movement.  I have never seen a sight of this nature.  When referencing the lights against the stars in the background, there was absolute zero movement among them.  Two of the lights were too bright to be stars yet they had the stillness of stars.  Any aircraft would show evidence of movement unless they were ALL on a course DIRECTLY toward me or extremely far away.  However, the lights faded off with no movement, either in reference to the background stars, or each other.  I cannot explain or understand what they could have been.   The lights completely disappeared a sharp contrast to the bright magnitude they had, especially the two brightest lights, just seconds before they faded to nothing without movement.  Many times in the past, I have observed aircraft lights which seem to get brighter in magnitude as they approach in a path directly towards my location, only to dim as their paths change.  But their movements are always apparent in such cases and the lights never disappear.  Although I was driving at the time, the lights were directly ahead of me and I had slowed down to nearly a stop observing them because I could not get my eyes off of them.  While waiting for the lights to reappear I took note of the surrounding stars and, from my perspective, they were located in or below the region of the constellation Pegasus.  My vision was very clear in this case since I was wearing my corrective lenses at the time, which gives me a vision of 20/20.  The dimmer, background stars of the lower portion of the Pegasus constellation remained quite clear.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
Dual object;2005-06-29 23:25:00;4:00;Dual object I was sitting in my backyard tonight, with a couple of friends. We saw the most amazing light show ever.

Three lights, two red, one white, on erratic flight paths;2005-10-23 00:30:00;2 min;Three lights, two red, one white, on erratic flight paths looking South from a ground point approx. 10 miles North of downtown Ft. Worth, TX, I observed 3 lights, two red, on white, that appeared to be on a final approach path to the DFW airport.   The lights stopped, then would move independently around each other, continue on level flight, then hover in circles again -  I estimated distance to be 5 miles from me at about 10,000 feet.   One red light veered off Westward and disappeared the remaining 2 lights, one red and one white continued to play with each other (the white making small circles around the red and vice-versa) and then took a trajectory mostly straight up and East and disappeared at what appeared to be an extreme altitude.    No great amount of speed was noted, only a very erratic flight path.  No sound was noted.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293

Approx. 2330hrs on 1 August 06, I was standing in my back yard facing south (almost exactly 180 degrees).  A flash of light more brilliant than anything I have seen before appeared almost directly in front of me (maybe 2 or 3 degrees to the west of where I was facing) and was moving downward.  It disappeared less than 2-3 seconds after it appeared.  No other witnesses.  I did call the local FD, assuming it may have been kids with fireworks.  Within 20 minutes, I began to hear sirens from emergency vehicles and PD choppers were circling that area of the sky.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293

Rather than disappearing into the southern horizon, the object continued traveling at a 40 degree angle, eventually disappearing out of sight.   The object's speed was that of a slower airplane and its elevation was below the clouds yet no discernible features were visible.   It was slightly larger than a typical lighted plane.

The night was overcast and through the clouds, I noticed a light move across the sky and assumed it was an airplane.  After a few minutes, I noticed the same light.  As I continued to observe it, I noticed it was moving in a circular pattern – clockwise – over the same area.  It was one white light beam that was not clearly visible until it moved out of the clouds.   Using my compass, I noted the lights were coming from 326 degrees NW.  I watched the lights for over 40 minutes before returning inside.  The beam continued the same circular pattern and moved at the same speed.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
