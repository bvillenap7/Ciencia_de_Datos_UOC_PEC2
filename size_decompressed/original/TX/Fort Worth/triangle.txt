Grayish metallic triangle shaped craft emits green aura over Texas.;1978-08-24 17:00:00;8 min.;Grayish metallic triangle shaped craft emits green aura over Texas. On this summer day my brother, a friend and I were walking down the street.  I sensed something unusual and we began to run not even knowing why.  We hid behind an auto and watched this craft hover silently from the east to west. It was right over head and it hovered to a stop right above us.  It was in plain sight during broad daylight.  As it hovered above us, it started to glow, an aura around it. It was glowing a greenish color.  I also observed that it had what looked like a circle of red in its center like a neon light.  It remained still for about 1 minute then slowly curved toward the south and left. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Very LARGE  V shaped objects or objects;2002-09-04 21:00:00;10-15 minutes;Very LARGE  V shaped objects or objects I had to return to Texas for a funeral and was staying with my sister.  My oldest daughter wanted to go swimming, so we all went out to the pool about 8PM or so.  I was sitting at the side of the pool when my sister started yelling the V is moving!!  I didn't quite understand what she was saying when she screamed at me to get over there because there was a V moving in the sky.  I looked up and seen the biggest object or collection of objects I have ever seen in my life.It was in the shape of a V but without the bottom line.  It was moving south at a slow pace, not super slow but I think too slow to be a formation of airplanes, besides I have never seen airplanes fly in a V formation.  If it was one object, at least 100 airplanes would have fit in this thing.  I am not sure what I seen but it was totally amazing and kept us in awe for a very long time.  I wanted to report this then but my sister told me I was crazy because nobody would believe us anyway, but I just felt the need to share this and would like to know if anyone else saw this that night.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
An object made up of 5 white lights in a V shape moved across the sky at a steady pace.;2003-09-03 22:45:00;30 seconds;An object made up of 5 white lights in a V shape moved across the sky at a steady pace. I was observing the stars when I noticed 5 lights, about the same magnitude as the brightest stars, moving across the sky headed directly South.  They never varied their formation or speed and traversed half the sky within about 30 seconds.  There were no unusual changes in direction or, if seperate crafts, break in formation.  There were no red/green flashing lights one expects from an airplane.  The white lights could not have been landing lights since the object was moving away from me.  The object was moving at probably 2 or 3 times the speed of the typical sattelite.  Also, moving directly South is an unlikely path for a sattelite, much less a formation of 5.  Also, it was not moving in the direction of the V, it appeared to be moving sideways.  In other words, the direction of travel was toward one arm of the V.  There was no sound and within half-a-minute it had disappeared in the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness does not specifically state whether the sighting was during the daytime or night, although we presume it was a nighttime sighting.  We have amended the time above to reflect that fact.  PD));32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
I saw a dark object that at times had a triangular appearance.  No noise was detected and there were no lights at all.;2007-01-24 17:00:00;30 mins.;I saw a dark object that at times had a triangular appearance.  No noise was detected and there were no lights at all. I was walking the dog about 5:30 PM Wed..,  Jan 24th, 2007.  The weather was very clear and breezy with some clouds.  The sun was beginning to go down in the west. I saw an object way off in the distance approaching from the north west.  It was quite high in the sky and moving slower than a jet plane moves. There were no clouds obscuring my view of the object.   I watched to see if I could see any lights but there were no bright lights or blinking lights. I could see no wings.  It was difficult to determine the shape but looked slightly triangular at one point.  I thought I could determine some shifting of the shape but I couldn't really tell.  It curved around to the west towards the setting sun.  It never varied in altitude, neither going up or down and the speed always remained the same.  I wondered if possibly it was a weather balloon but I have seen those before and usually the balloons relect white and this was dark brown.   I wondered about a large bird but it looked too big a bird and it wasn't a flock of birds but a solid object.  I watched this object for about ten to twelve minutes and then had to go inside because of the cold air.  It was still in sight when I went in.   Unfortunately I did not have my camera and was the only person outside at the time.   From my vantage point it was high enough in the sky to be way above the two story buildings and trees.  The size from where I was was about one eighth of an inch to a quarter of an inch.   We have alot of air traffic in the area because of DFW airport, Lockheed, and  what used to be Carswell AFB.  It looked as if it was high over the base at one point.   I am familiar with all types of aircrafts and balloons and this looked nothing like anything I have ever seen.    I would really like to know if this was a weather balloon or if any other reports have come in.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
((HOAX??))  Large Triangular U.F.O. Battles with Smaller U.F.O.s in Night Sky Over Ft. Worth, TX;2008-07-12 22:30:00;unsure;Large Triangular U.F.O. Battles with Smaller U.F.O.s in Night Sky Over Ft. Worth, TX Below, you will find an email that I just sent to some friends.  Note:  I filed one report on your website earlier, and left a voicemail message, so this is an important update.  I tried to leave another voicemail message, but your mailbox had become full.  Note:  I use the nickname Thoth with some of my spiritual friends.  URGENT: U.F.O.s Battle in Night Sky Over Ft. Worth, Texas  Large triangular craft dogfights with smaller disc-shaped U.F.O.s.  My spiritual friend XXXX in Ft. Worth, Texas, a fellow 11:11 promptee, sent me an update at 4:55 a.m. Eastern (3:55 Central [Ft. Worth]) on what she and her stepfather have been witnessing in the skies above their house tonight, Saturday July 12- Sunday, July 13, 2008.  Below is her latest email followed by my response.  Again, this is not a hoax people. I am a writer, metaphysician, and former professional journalist with the Hearst Newspaper Corp, CBS and NBC TV-news affiliates and would not joke about something like this. This is history being made!  ************************************************************  (my nickname),  Okay, I was just out there again. The sky was real clouded up, but not like normal clouds! More like how chemtrails are, a trail that swells up and gets fatter as it spreads out.I could see two of them, and yes, definatly what a dogfight would look like!  What I (we) saw earlier looked like a very large triangular shaped craft with several white lights around it and one red light. But they were blinking or rotating. The other ones were very small in comparison to those.Because it looked like they were flying right at them and then they would turn away sharply then the big craft would sort of chase it and then shoot out the opposite direction really fast.At one time we counted 6 of the large ones.  I am so glad my step-dad was there to see it too, I would of thought I was seeing things and not ever told anyone else. But I know what we saw!  (friend's name)  *************************************************************  (friend's name):  Okay, so are you telling me that it looked like a dogfight between a very large triangular U.F.O. and a bunch of smaller disc-shaped U.F.O.s?  If so, this mirrors what a few people have seen using expensive, military-style, night-vision scopes. They actually had a show on Coast-to-Coast about this several months ago, but I've never heard of anyone being able to see something like this without night-vision equipment. I know this sounds like something out of Star Trek, but the U.F.O.s must have had their cloaking systems down?  Remember how I told you recently that there are good E.T.s and others? Well, some who are supposed to be in-the-know say they have been fighting around the Earth lately because, believe it or not, and again this sounds like something out of a Sci-Fi movie, our planet supposedly is the site of the last struggle between the Light and the dark.  You, (friend's name), may have witnessed the opening salvos of the open Battle for Planet Earth.  Is this real or what?  Wow! You have witnessed history, Jeanne, and I have been able to tell the world about it. This really is something else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What else can I say? Thanks for this update, keep watching the sky, and please try to keep track of all details regarding colors, shapes, time of events, etc. Do you have a camcorder? If so, use it!  Let me know more asap.  Thanks, and may God and the Angels be with you.  I will forward your update to everyone.  Again, please keep me posted.  (my nickname)  Important Note:  I sent a follow-up email to my friend in Ft. Worth with NUFORC's phone number, a link to your online-report form, and asked my friend, if she was able and willing, to contact NUFORC directly since she was the one who actually witnessed these potentially-historic events.

Large triangular shaped craft with white lights blinking or rotating around it.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars?  PD));2008-07-12 23:00:00;approx. 3 hrs;Large triangular shaped craft with white lights blinking or rotating around it and one red light, July 12, 2008 10:30  p.m. Fort Worth, Tx. I was sitting outside in the dark looking at the sky and noticed what I at first thought was a star. Then it began moving around and changing directions real fast. It was triangular shaped with white lights all around it and one red light. The lights were blinking or rotating. There appeared to be other smaller crafts darting toward it and then they would turn sharply and go in the opposite direction. And the large triangular craft would sort of chase after them. Either the smaller crafts were shooting at the larger one or vise a versa. But you could see smoke trails  all around it from what looked like missiles. I went in the house and told my step-dad and he came outside too with his binoculars. We counted at least six of the larger crafts all around the sky. We could see what looked like laser lights shooting all around it, then it looked almost like fireworks. Then I saw something out of the corner of my eye and had to take a double look. Above the trees and the house next door was a ball of fire falling slowly to the ground but it almost looked like a big balloon drifting down real slow. I yelled at my step-dad to look, we stood there watching it trying to figure out what it was. It was real close and it looked like it was landing in the back yard across the street. I tried to follow it but lost it. I know it must be in the close area.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
Triangular craft with white glowing lights;2008-10-02 21:00:00;2 Minutes;Triangular craft with white glowing lights My friend and i were driving, heading westbound on a near by dirt road, when a glowing light caught my eye. This wouldn't be the first time a glowing light has grabbed my attention before because i've spotted this same craft three times already. It was dark outside, but you could definately see the distinct shape of the ship- a triangle. It had two white larger lights glowing on each side of it, and four white smaller lights in the direct center.  I watched it for a good 30 seconds and it shot up right, paused- hovering, floated a little more to the right, then shot straight up into the air and disappeared.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
At around  midnight I saw a UFO flying across the sky.  Two triangles Flying one in front of the other with a blinking light on the end;2010-09-30 02:50:00;about 30 seconds;At around  midnight I saw a UFO flying across the sky.  Two triangles Flying one in front of the other with a blinking light on the end As I was sitting outside with my little brother, something caught our eye in the sky. We looked up surprised at what we saw.  There were two triangle Unidentified Flying Objects in the sky flying one in front of the other.  The one in the back had a red blinking light on the back of it and was probably the brightest I have ever seen.  It was no more than 300 feet away from my brother and I. The sound was like a breath of air after being held under water for two minutes. Just an unpleasnt almost screatching breath in your ear. Like nothing i have ever heard before.  It was quiet but at the same time loud. its slowd down towards the middle of my sight as if it saw me.  Then quickly sped into the darkness, and disappeard.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
