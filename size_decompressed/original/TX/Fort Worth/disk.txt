Scintillating silvery, metallic object, probably disk-shaped, apparently changing attitude;1970-03-20 16:00:00;10 minutes;Scintillating silvery, metallic object, probably disk-shaped, apparently changing attitude I was standing on the crest of a hill above my parent's house (in Fort Worth, Texas), looking northwards, on 20 March 1970 (approximate date) at about 4:00 PM (I was 13 years old at the time). I would sometimes look for air traffic from Carswell Air Force, to my west, from this vantage point. The sky was clear. There was no air traffic in my immediate field of view.  I noticed a silvery, metallic object about 30 degrees above the horizon, due north. It appeared to be elliptical, but was probably disk-shaped (1). The object was perhaps two degrees in size, measured along its horizontal axis, and appeared to be fairly distant (there were no physical points of reference that would allow me to judge the size or distance of the object). The outline of the object's surface was distinct. I might not have noticed the object had it not changed its physical appearance while I was watching it. It appeared to scintillate or wink, causing the object briefly to disappear, or at least become difficult to see. For the duration of the observation, the object did not move horizontally or vertically from its position, nor did it appear to change size. I presumed from this that the object was spatially motionless. I could detect no sound from the object, although this may have been a function of the object's possible distance from me.  (1) I could not, at the time, account for the object's scintillation, although I thought it might have been due to some kind of movement. I now believe the object was in fact disk-shaped, having an apparent elliptical shape due to the oblique angle at which I was viewing it. I also now believe that the object's scintillation, or winking, was the result of the object changing its attitude relative to my position. If, for example, the object had been shifting its attitude (relative to me, the observer) by, say, plus/minus 45 degrees along its horizontal axis, it might have appeared to be a scintillating ellipse.  I observed the object for perhaps 10 minutes, after which I could no longer visually resolve it in the fairly bright sky.  Had the object been a conventional fixed-wing or rotor-winged aircraft, I believe I would have been able to track its movement from its (apparent) rest position to a point in the sky where it would have been obscured by some intervening object or would have gone below my field of view. It was not a lighter-than-air vehicle (e.g., a blimp or weather balloon), as I had seen these in Fort Worth before and was familiar with their appearance in the sky. It was not a missile, as I was also familiar with their appearance in the sky. The fact that the object appeared to loiter also presents some difficulties with its being a conventional aircraft.  The object did not appear to be any meteorological phenomenon - at least none with which I was or am familiar. It was also not an astronomical phenomenon. The sky was far too bright to have allowed stars to be seen and, as we all know, planets do not scintillate.  The object could have been some type of experimental vehicle. Working for a major manufacturer of advanced (read classified) air vehicles, though, I do not believe this would have been the case. If for no other reason, disk-shaped structures are difficult to control aerodynamically with current technology. It is also difficult to explain why an experimental (or conventional) air vehicle would want to change its attitude in the manner this object appeared to have.  I am 46 years old. I live in Los Angeles, CA. I studied astronomy and physics as an undergraduate and have two Master's degrees (although not in physics or astronomy). As I mentioned above, I work for an aerospace company, selling manned and unmanned air vehicles and systems. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293

A small, thin object moving in a fast circular motion;1995-10-03 20:20:00;1.5 hrs;A small, thin object moving in a fast circular motion On the night of October 3, 1995 I was walking to a friends apartment on College Ave. when I noticed the Fort Worth Police Helicopter flying low over the near houses. Then that's when I also noticed there was another object below the helicopter. The object seemed to be moving in a very fast circular motion making a whipping sound. The object appeared to be thin, small and white colored about the size of a small compact car with a red light on top.  The FWPD helicopter appeared to be observing this one object with curiousity at a close distance. As I watched in amazement I noticed that this object moved within a 3 block radius at the speed of a few seconds. This went on for about an hour and a half. As I left my friend's apartment headed southbound for home, object still in motion, after about 4 blocks distance the strangest thing that I noticed was after all that time no one else seemed to have noticed the event other than myself and 2 other friends.  Oddly enough, a month later in November I was at home with my son asleep in bed when I was waking up from my sleep I heard soft whispers that sounded like He is waking up, when suddenly I was struck by a jolt of electricity on the right side of my ear and as I opened my eyes I saw a bright flash and I heard an electrifying, popping sound.  After this I must have passed out for about 30 minutes and I woke up feeling very nauseated and weak as if my energy had been sucked out of me. A few days later I discovered on the back of my ear a red mark which looked like a spider bite. Whenever I would touch the mark it was sensitive to the touch and it felt like to me that my head would explode!  In the month of December while watching the news on tv they were discussing a man who had walked in the VAF building in Waco, Texas at gunpoint declaring a standoff. This man had previously appeared on a talk show discussing his daytime experience that occured at his home in Cleburne, Texas.  He had videotaped an object similar to the one I saw in October hovering over hi! s stable s.They disclosed on the show that this videotape was in no way altered.  I'm led to believe that there might be a connection in our stories about this object.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
Classical UFO seen to have 'dropped' from 11 o'clock high--hover in-place--then whisked off to the due NNW. Fort Worth, Tx.;2001-03-30 09:28:00;7 seconds;Classical UFO seen to have 'dropped' from 11 o'clock high--hover in-place--then whisked off to the due NNW. Fort Worth, Tx. Driving north on 831 (Crowley Road)--just crossing the Fort Worth city limits from Crowley, Texas: the sky was light gray with patchy clouds in this area, as to the south, west and east: there was a moderate, steady rain and darkened skies. Temp: 54 F. Wind: 3 mph out of ENE. The rain had stopped at this point in time and in distance of my travel by car, and suddenly: I was 'compelled' to look up to the due NNW (330 degrees) whereupon a 'classical' UFO of a dull, silvery shade of color dropped straight down from 11 o'clock high to 9 o'clock high and loomed in-place for only a few seconds--just long enough for me to see it, then it whisked away in a straight line to the due NNW at incredable speed. There was no 'contrail,' nor 'tail' of smoke/vapor of any sort. The 'UFO' appeared 'exactly' as the image videotaped by me on June 11, 1995, as a 'freeze-frame' can be seen at: http://((URL deleted)).org This was a delightfully, awesome sighting--as I did feel compelled to look up--right at it--then it zipped away . . . I affirm that the above is true and a correct accounting of this stated sighting. ((name deleted.

Very large disc with multicolored lights hovering not exactly horizontally, but slanted, seen by 4 people in different places.;2005-03-15 20:00:00;different times;Very large disc with multicolored lights hovering not exactly horizontally, but slanted, seen by 4 people in different places. First I was the only one that saw it while i was playing volleyball with some of my friends in Stone Meadows near Hulen, i thought it was a plane, and told my friend Whoa! whats that, its huge! And it just hovering! Without looking he just said, that would be called a plane. After that, my friend called me from her house asking me to come over and she mentioned a UFO over her house, but kiddingly, when i told her i had seen it too, so i went over to her house, but it was gone, after that i went over to pick one of my friends from her house to go eat when while we were driving down Colombus we saw it again, but some houses were in the way, and we drove faster, and it just hovered over towards Granbury Rd. which is the last place we saw it. Took a video, but it is against all these other lights, so you can't really see it.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293

It had 4 bright white head light, 1 blue-ish light on the tailed and one red light underneath on the bottom of the saucer.  It hovered for a few seconds after it had made its way to the water tower, then it sped off in a upward, and I the right direction.  As I chased it, it went out of my view and I drove around the corner and found it hovering above a local middle school.I stopped looking for it.  Then I started chasing it again and it sped away, in the upward to the right motion. I couldn't find it anymore do I went home.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293

I decided to record and take pictures of the odd looking sky and clouds.  As soon as I started record I noticed and odd shape on the video screen only.
