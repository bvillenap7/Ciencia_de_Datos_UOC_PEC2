I layed down on my bed and turned my bedlight off. My cat's nightly ritual is, she then jumps up next to me to get her bellly scratched. All of the sudden she flips over and looks at the wall. Her ears went straight up, so I looked at the wall to see what had her attention. There was a beautiful light the size of a baseball with a halo around it. The bright light danced on the wall for a few seconds, then it shot straight out my window. I live on the third floor of my apartments and my windows are heavily draped, including a black out shade that was pulled down. My cat was so freaked out. It took her a least 15 minutes to calm down. I jumped up and turned the computer off. Was it a UFO or something spiritual?  Who knows.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293

The othe;1999-08-14 22:07:00;3min 30sec;I Saw two fuzzy things what I thought were meterorites traveling east to west.One was behind the other going at extreme speed. The other one came later about 1 1/2min later same speed and direction. My wife and I were outside trying to see some shooting stars and we saw three satellites this night and all of a sudden we saw two fuzzy looking meteorites, we thought, traveling east to west and one following the other. I did not have the binoculars at the time and when we saw the two I brought the glasses outside and waited to see something.  Then out of the same direction came another fuzzy object and this time I focused the binoculars and it turned out to be a circle with a very slight orange glow. I could completely see the disk. It had no lights, not leaving a trail, no noise just going very fast and they were about 75 to 80 degrees from the horizon.  Looks like the last one was trying to catchup with the other two. They passed almost above us coming from Dallas going west. I will never feel the same anymore.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293

Circular light seen zig-zagging over Ft Worth on Sept. 2nd, 2001;2001-09-02 08:59:00;15 seconds;Circular light seen zig-zagging over Ft Worth on Sept. 2nd, 2001 While walking with my wife in Foster parkk this morning, I observed a circular white light moving across the sky in a southeasterly direction for approximately 15 seconds. It appeared to have a constant speed and at one point zigzagged (i.e. moved at the same relative speed to the East, then to the South, and then to the Southeast), and then proceeded in the direction that it was taking when I first observed it.  I finally got my wife's attention and she observed the same object for approximately 5 seconds.  We both watched it suddenly disappear.  It did not have any characteristics belonging to those of a meteorite which I have seen many times.  I have never seen anything like this in my entire life.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293

It was moving at a high rate of speed its direction of travel was east to west it seemed to move effortlessly. But its movements were very jerky. There was an eerie humming noise it was a very low tone. It hovered in one spot for a few seconds then jerked diagonally up ward to the right and stopped and hovered for a couple seconds, spinning the entire time.  Then it jerked diagonally down to the right were it stopped and hovered. Then it dropped just a little in its altitude before accelerating at an amazing speed and disappearing almost immediately after this acceleration began, not even a second after it was gone. Even though it was dark outside you could see where the disk disturbed the air it was just in and you could see the path it traveled for about 10 seconds after the craft was totally gone.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
Black round silent object moving slowly to northwest from southwest., no lights, no jet trail, no sound.;2009-09-09 19:32:00;10 mins.;Black round silent object moving slowly to northwest from southwest., no lights, no jet trail, no sound. This evening at approximately 7:32PM, Sept. 9, ’09, I was out walking and looked up slightly to the north, and saw a small black object.  At first, I thought it was a large bird, but there was no wing movement.  No sound, no jet trail, no lights, very black.  It stayed on a steady course from the southwest to the northwest. moving very slowly.  I saw a similar object last July 3, 2008, but the sky was slightly darker, and the object was lower.  It moved very slowly, as I was able to watch it for at least ten minutes, both times. This year, there were clouds, and they appeared high and thin.  The object was black and showed up against the sky and clouds as did the object last year.  I did file a report with the National UFO Reporting Center last year as well.  The object last year, appeared to have some indentation at the top and was very black.  This time it looked more round, but the movement was exactly the same.  There is an air base (joint command) off a! bout three miles from where I live in Fort Worth, TX. in the direction the object was moving.  Last year, when I described what I had seen with a coworker he had seen the same object. He lives close to where I live.  He described the object exactly as I did, moving from the southwest to the northwest.  Interestingly, he said one of his neighbors had their cell phone and it began to make noises and light up as the object passed.  I think possibly it might be a government experiment, but it was very strange.  No triangular shape.  Just a rounder shape.  I did take a photo of the object with my cell phone, but I am not sure I captured it as it was high.  I would be glad to foreward the photo to be analyzed.  It would appear as just a black spot, small.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
Very bright twin planet-like lights appearing to E/SE of Fort worth, TX that faded out very fast.;2010-10-07 20:15:00;30 seconds;Very bright twin planet-like lights appearing to E/SE of Fort worth, TX that faded out very fast. First of all, I am a believer in UFOs, although I have never actually seen one. I was sitting on the back porch, as I do every night, and watching the stars appear.  I noticed very bright lights in the East Southeast sky that were unusually bright.  They had the appearance and bright light of a planet but I knew this could not be the case. I am not sure what planet is in the Eastern sky over Texas this time of year, but these two objects were due South of this planet and appeared just as bright.  Almost to the point where you would think there three planets in a small cluster. There were several planes in the sky at the time, so it was easy to distinguish the two objects that I was observing and determine that they were not planes.  Plus, the objects were at a such a far distance that you would not be able to spot a plane that far away. As soon as I got up out of my chair to observe further, the object closest to the South vanished very quickly.  It did not appear to move away quickly, but rather it just faded out very fast. The other object was still shining brightly, just as bright as the planet to the North, and then, it too vanished almost immediately. Although I live very near to an Air Force and observe the flight patterns all of the time, this by no means resembled any of the planes that fly by and these objects were so very, very far in the distance that I do not think a plane could fly that high.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
Red LED lite @ incredible speed, approached saw circular sheer curtain of opalecent color 6 rays glowed around circle;2011-09-17 04:31:00;2 minutes;Red LED lite @ incredible speed, approached saw circular sheer curtain of opalecent color 6 rays glowed around circle Saturday September 17, 2011 4:31am: I went outside, was on 2nd floor balcony, which faces due south, smoking a cigarette before I went to sleep, wasn't looking into sky, and was looking straight ahead into next apartment building breezeway. A small non-flashing, red light (like a LED light or power indicator light) came into my field of vision I wasn’t looking up at the sky or anything.  It immediately captured my interest because I thought it was flying extremely low.  I then considered a logical explanation I thought it must be a helicopter?  However we don’t see many helicopters in this neighborhood unless it’s the law chasing somebody & if that were the case, there would have been searchlights.  We are not close to the hospital district, downtown police helicopter landing strip, or airbases. I considered that maybe it was an airplane of some sort?  If it was, wouldn’t it be flashing?  In addition, don’t they have flashing white lights as well?   As it approached, I heard absolutely no sound whatsoever. The sky was clear however it had rained for the 1st time in over four months most of the day before.  The air was humid & thick.  What I saw was moving at an extreme high rate of speed, faster than anything I've seen.  I couldn’t take my eyes off it and I blinked a couple times, just in case my eyes were playing tricks on me. It remained at the same elevation, heading from my right to left diagonal path.  As it grew closer, I noticed some sort of circular type field around the red light in center.  This circle was not a sphere it was more like a sheer curtain, flat, possibly a force field?  The circle was translucent & it was glistening/shimmering opalecant colors (pink, blue, green crystal).  It was not twinkling like Christmas lights, no blink pattern at all, it was more iridescent like abalone shell, but again it was about 40% transparency.  There was also some sort of crystal beams or rays I think 6, surrounding the opal circle.  They were shining from the circular field, all the same length, just about the length of the circle in size. I simply couldn't take my eyes off it. I then realized I had my Android mobile in my hand, so I hit the buttons to quickly try to capture it on digital.  It took me less than 5 seconds to get it started, by then the object was straight above me. I tried to get it in my viewfinder, but it was moving so quickly, I just couldn't keep up.  I attempted 3 shots, about 8 seconds apart, unfortunately, I've no flash & the lens was on the full zoom out level. It then was out of my view as it flew over the building.  I ran down the stairs trying to adjust the zoom in, I got to ground level and out of the breezeway.  However, my view was then blocked by the building. In retrospect, I should have run to the street, but I didn't think of it, I was so amazed!  The event lasted about two minute’s total.  I felt no fear of the object I know they didn’t notice me.  I gave up & went upstairs & into the apartment.  I looked to see what I might have gotten on digital, but with no luck, just darkness.  I went to sleep.  I woke up at 10am & the first thing that went through my mind was the event.  I plan to upload the photos onto my computer & see if I can find anything by resizing them.  I have started a drawing of the object in Adobe Photoshop.  To my knowledge, no one else witnessed the event. I will send a drawing of what I saw in a future report.

I kept good eye on one of them to see if it was going to hit but as it approached closer it seemed like it was a oval with a halo around it the color was red was flying about airplane height & then as it slowed down it started to fly away really fast,   last maybe about 2 minutes.

A blue meteor that suddenly stopped.;2014-08-02 05:58:00;40 seconds;A blue meteor that suddenly stopped On August 2, 2014, 5:58am I was driving westbound on John T White Rd in east Fort Worth, just off Eastchase Parkway.   My wife was in the passenger seat.  I witnessed a blue meteor directly through my front windshield just to the left of my rear view mirror.  I started to point and tell my wife there was a meteor and then it stopped in place.  She asked me why I was pointing at a star and I told her it could not be a star.   The object appeared to have come from the northwest and traveled across the sky rapidly like a typical meteor only it stopped suddenly.  It stopped in the western portion of the sky about a quarter of the sky up from where the sun would set before I lost visual.  There was no fluctuation in the light at all and no tail.  There were no blinking lights only solid blue like a bright star.  I told no one about this except my wife who was with me.   The next day on Facebook a few friends mentioned seeing a blue light in the sky behaving oddly so I knew it was not just a onetime fluke.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
Bluish white bright object flying in a NE direction near Granbury Road and Interstate 20;2018-02-05 06:55:00;20 seconds;Bluish white bright object flying in a NE direction near Granbury Road and Interstate 20 I was driving along Granbury Road in a NE direction approaching Interstate 20.  I witnessed a bright bluish white ball in the sky.  My speed was about 40 mph.  I looked out the driver window and about 30 degrees above my head this bright round object was moving quickly through the sky in a straight line parallel to the ground.  It was moving at least twice as fast as I was.  If it was a long distance from my car it could have been extremely fast.  I think there were clouds in the sky, but I’m not sure.  Before it disappeared it turned into 2 lines parallel to the ground, one thicker than the other, then quickly vanished.;32.7445982971981;-97.3399319374293
