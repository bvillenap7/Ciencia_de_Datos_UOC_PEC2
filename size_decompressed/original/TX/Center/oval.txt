Odd Object in the Sky Over Northeast Texas in Broad Daylight;2003-10-19 16:00:00;10 seconds;Odd Object in the Sky Over Northeast Texas in Broad Daylight My fiance and I were driving to Center to buy groceries.  I was on the passenger side of my car, looking out the window.  I noticed a rather metallic looking object in the sky.  It didnt appear to be moving.  It was a little dull looking, but you could still tell it was metallic.  I lost sight of it when we drove by a grove of pine trees.  When the sky was in clear view again, the object was gone.  It wasnt too far off, but it wasnt very close either.  I know it wasnt a reflection from my window.  I know it wasnt a reflection on a cloud.  I'm not saying I SAW ALIENS!, I'm just saying I saw an unexplained object over the treeline.  If anyone else noticed anything in the sky over eastern Texas, I would like to hear from you.;31.7884;-94.1898
