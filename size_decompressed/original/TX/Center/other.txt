Star-like object observed at night falls out of sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of ISS?  PD));2009-06-30 22:00:00;1 minute;Star-like object observed at night falls out of sky. The object was observed at about 10:00 PM. I was driving down the road and looked up to see what looked like a moving star. I know it wasn't a shooting star because it moved much slower. It was going in the same direction that I was going. As i watched it move many miles ahead of me, it started heading for the ground.  It looked like it ended up on the ground somewhere. I tried to locate it but I realized that it could have been the next town over. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
