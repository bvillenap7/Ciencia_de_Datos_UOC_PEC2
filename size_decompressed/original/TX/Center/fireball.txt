Wednesday night, a few friends and I went swimming in the lake down my dirt road.  I took one friend home then the other stayed the night.  I oke up about 3:30am Thursday morning, and felt strange (really hard to explain) and couldnt fall back to sleep so I walked down to the lake to see if I could catch any meteors left from the shower a week back.  As I was laying there (on the cement of the spillway/dam) a light caught my eye across the other side of the lake.  A bluish white light about he size of a basketball zoomed (I say that because it went really fast) over a couple of feet above the water, kinda slowed toward the center, then sped into the trees on the oppisite side.  It had a bright reflection that actually seemed brighter than the object itself and there was no sound at all.  Actually I dont even remember hearing the crickets or splash of water.  I totally freaked and ran all the way home.  I never said anything to anybody until today and they suggested I call the police or something so I reported it here.  I won't ever go out there again!;31.7884;-94.1898
