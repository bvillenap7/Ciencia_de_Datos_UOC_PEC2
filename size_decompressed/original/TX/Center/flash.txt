We were sitting our hot tub looking up at the stars.  The sky was very black.  I was showing them where the big dipper was.  Then all of sudden we noticed it.. It appeared as a typical passenger jet,.with a beacon blinking about every 2 or 3 seconds.  The biggest difference is that it only took  about 8 seconds ( 3 or 4 blinks ) for it to move from straight above my head to the horizon. I’ve seen many meteorites.  I’ve never seen one with a consistent blinking light. In a nutshell, this thing looked like typical jet seen in the night sky.  The big difference is that it traversed the sky in  about 10 seconds rather than 2 or 3 minutes. This was definitely something I’ve never seen.
