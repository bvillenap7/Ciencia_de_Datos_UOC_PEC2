spotted twice, triangular with white lights, no sound;2002-05-15 01:30:00;3-5 seconds;spotted twice, triangular with white lights, no sound I was sitting on the back steps outside smoking and I noticed a dim white light moving very fast from above the trees.  It seemed to speed up and fly directly over me, no sound at all.  I could barely see the shape of it against the sky and it looked to be triangular.  It had three white lights around its edges one at the very front and the other two down both sides.  This is the same thing that me and two other friends seen about 2 years ago at a lake about a mile from here.  I drew a picture of that encounter and it is definitely the same.;31.7884;-94.1898
