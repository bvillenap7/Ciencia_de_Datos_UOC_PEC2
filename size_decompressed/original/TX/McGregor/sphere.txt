Small mettal ball seen over ranch.;1997-06-15 16:00:00;1 minute;Small mettal ball seen over ranch. I was feeding som of my employer's horses when I happened to look up and saw what at first I thought was a bird sitting on a powerline. I soon realized that it was not a bird because it had a metalic appearance to it. My best description of it is like a pinball or ball bearing at a distance of 15yrds. This object did a brief loop almost reaching the ground and stopped at it's original positon, paused momentarily, then slowly moved in a strait line to the east, then suddenly dissapeared. I have not seen this object again, but it gave me the creeps. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  Source is semi-anonymous.  PD));31.4433;-97.3899000000001
