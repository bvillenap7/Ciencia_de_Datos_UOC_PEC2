Lying in bed, I can see the sky through my mini blinds.  It was between 3:00 and 4:30 AM.  Don’t recall exactly the time or date (late November or early December).  I looked up in the sky and noticed a lot of activity.  This was what prompted me to look in the first place.  When I looked up I saw a couple of oval shapes with flashing lights don’t recall the color except that I know there were red and green lights.  These lights were flashing like crazy.  When I got up and looked out the window, I saw at least 10 oval shapes.  About 3 to the south and at least 7 scattered around to the north.  Scattered, but closely.  No particular formation either.  I excitedly woke my daughter and told her what I saw.  She looked up and said, Those are satellites, Mom!  I looked for a few minutes, thought she might be right, and went back to bed.  For the time period that I watched, nothing moved except the lights.  I have never seen anything out of the ordinary and am not inclined to seeing odd things but this was quite a sight.  I really do not believe that these were satellites.  I certainly have never seen anything like this and, as I said, my blinds point up so I have a great view of the moon at night.  I would say they were fairly large since I could make out their shape and they did not seem to be terribly high in the sky although not really close either.  I have wanted to share this with someone and now have found your website so there you go! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));29.5236;-95.0276
