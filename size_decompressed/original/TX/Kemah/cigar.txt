Driving east during morning commute.  These objects appeared to hover in the same spot in the sky.  There was a distinct line of clouds under the objects.  They both reflected the  morning sun on the same side and were floating at the exact same angle.  They stayed offset to one another.  It was difficult to gauge distance  and scale but they appeared to be big, high in the sky and at least six miles away.  They were visible in the same spot for at least five minutes and my drive turned me away from them.  I could not recall ever seeing anything like them.  My phone pics do not do justice.  They were not orbs but had clearly defined edges.;29.5236;-95.0276
