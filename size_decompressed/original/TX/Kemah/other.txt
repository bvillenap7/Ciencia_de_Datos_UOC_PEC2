It was moving east to west.  It was faster than an airplane, but not by much.   After about 15 seconds I asked the people I was with what it was, but only one person saw it.  The object made a quick zig zag and disappeared.  The object either had legs or there were a few crafts flying together, and the outside crafts vibrated or shook while the middle didn't.   The object flew continuously, methodically, clearly and then poof disappeared.;29.5236;-95.0276
