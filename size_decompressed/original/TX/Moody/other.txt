She is 60 and has seen several objects throughout her life. She was driving roughly north from Moody to McGregor on Highway 317. Here is the text of the e-mail she sent telling me about it.  I was on my way to McGregor. I had just passed Blue Cut (Rd.) and of course looking up in the sky. At first glance I thought what I saw was a plane it was metallic shiny but then I saw that it didn't have wings and was going very slow. I have never seen a metallic helicoptor and I could tell it didn't have rotors. It was shaped sort of like a small blimp. It wasn't very high off the ground maybe a mile up if that. I turned on Schmidt Lane which is that first road that is on the left after Blue Cut Rd and it kept on going slowly toward the southwest. I looked down at the speedometer to see how fast I was going and when I looked up it was gone. I was driving about 10 miles an hour. It wasn't a blimp and it wasn't a plane or a helicopter. It didn't appear to have any lights like a plane or chopper would have. It was weird. I watched it for at least 2 minutes maybe longer. It wasn't making any noise either. So there you go. It was between 9:30 am and 9:40 that I saw it.   As she notes, she is an avid sky watcher. This was in daylight on a clear day. This area of TX is close to Fort Hood and is near a flightpath, so we see lots of aircraft and know what jets, helicopters, and such look like and move like.;31.2548;-97.4105
