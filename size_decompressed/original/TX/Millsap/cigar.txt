It travelled left to right with very bright lights that were luminous of yellowish green. The lights disappeared, all except for a dim blue light in what appeared to be the center of the craft. At that moment,a light flashed from the craft that was half the radius of the length of the craft. This was very bright. Shortly after that, the craft dissappeared going east. A helicopter came about shortly after and cicled the entire area where the craft was by my two sons and I.A ways up was our driveway, we never saw further signs of the craft, only the sound of the searching helicopter.;32.7462;-97.9569
