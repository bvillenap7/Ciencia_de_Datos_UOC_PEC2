Formation around cloud over lake that disappeared and emitted small bright light.;2009-12-26 01:36:00;10-15min;Formation around cloud over lake that disappeared and emitted small bright light. In the early morning hours of December 26th, 2009, I was driving home when I noticed that in the distance there was a large, elongated cloud that was illuminated in an odd way. Upon a second look at the cloud, I noticed that there were five lights surrounding the object in a circular fashion.  At first I thought that the lights were just a really clear constellation, but despite their brightness in comparison to other objects, they were also hazy as if each had a fog around them. Each time that I would look back at the cloud ( I was driving in the same general direction each time) I noticed that something about the formation of the lights would change.  For instance, there would be three lights in stead of five or one light instead of five.  Eventually, there were no lights left in the circular pattern around the cloud, and then the cloud seemed to become brighter than before.  By this time, I had pulled over at an overlook point which provided a decent view of a portion of Medina Lake and turned off the ignition, and I could see that the cloud that I had been watching was over the lake.  I watched as a bright, small line of white light stretched out in the center of the largest point of the cloud (the cloud was comparable in shape to a large turkey baster, with the activity taking place at the “bulb” of this cloud “turkey baster”).  The light was a perfectly straight line that then shrunk back to nothing.  At this time, I started my car and left! the scene and started driving again.;29.5467;-98.926
