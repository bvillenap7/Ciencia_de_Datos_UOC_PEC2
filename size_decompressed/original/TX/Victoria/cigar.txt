It looked like it almost had a tail, but wasn't, or didn't look like, a fireball/meteor/comet/Asteroid.   It wasn't very high in the sky from where I was at.  It also wasn't going very fast.   I watched it for a few minutes until I couldn't see it anymore.   Also, it was flying South. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
