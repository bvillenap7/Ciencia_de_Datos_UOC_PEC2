UFO seen over Texas skys in the late '70s;1978-06-01 22:00:00;30 seconds;UFO seen over Texas skys in the late '70s A friend and I were outside his residence late one evening in the summer of '77 or '78. He was playing his guitar and I was lying on the hood a car staring up at the stars.  The first unusual thing to happen was a meteor that curved as it entered the atmosphere.  I mentoned this to my friend.  Then about 5 min. later I was still looking up when an object appeared.  It was moving across the sky in a perfect straight line directly over us.  It was an elongated oval shape.  It had no color and made no sound.  There were no lights.  It was difficult to tell how high or how large it was but if I had to guess I would say about 50 feet long.  It moved sideways and stayed on a perfect line until it disappeared into the horizon.  It was traveling mabye at 100 mph.  But again it was difficult to judge speed or size.  The thing that sticks in my mind is that we could see the object very clearly.  It was directly overhead and the lights of the city seemed to illuminate the bottom. It was a dark object. We got a very good long look and talked to each other about it as it passed overhead.  The next day I called the local airport and asked if any reports were called in or any balloon type craft were in the area at that time.  None were reported.  My friend and I lost contact with each other shortly after the sighting and have never spoken about this.  I understand that a weather station somewhere in south Texas used to lose balloons occasionally and this could be a possibility but I have never seen one of these balloons to compare, but the object I saw appeared solid and did not rotate or change attitude or altitude as I would think a balloon would.
