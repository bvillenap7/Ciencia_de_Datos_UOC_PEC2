Two Ufo sighting witin a month same town one 20 mins ago;2010-08-03 00:00:00;7 seconds;Two Ufo sighting within a month same town one 20 mins ago I was floating in a pool looking up trying to see a shooting star I had already seen three.  Out of no where I said look there is one, it came in faster than the speed of light  I know cause when it left it was going way faster than the shooting stars from earlier.  It stopped and it was hard to tell trajectory but I could swear it was coming right for us (Earth)   Stopped and went off to the side roughly an eight from right above to horizon.  Then stopped again and zoomed off. It was hard to tell size but judging from sight I’d say at least the size of America but probably way bigger than the moon.  I have a witness who can corroborate.

Rectangle object with three circular dim red lights.;2012-04-17 21:30:00;7 seconds;Rectangle object with three circular dim red lights. On April 17, 2012, I was standing in my backyard looking up at Mars and the constellation Leo.  It was a clear night and no moon light, when an object flew into my vision.  It was very dark with three red lights on the bottom.  It was rectangle in shape and I could see very dim white lights at the top of the rectangle.  I could tell that I was not seeing the whole object.  There were no beacon lights and the object did not make a sound.  If I hadn’t been looking up, it would have flown of my head without me knowing.  The three red lights on the bottom of this object were circular with a red dot in the center. (Like a target).  It was traveling at 40 to 45 mph and was no higher than 150 to 200 feet in the air.;28.8159982300885;-97.0073176991151
