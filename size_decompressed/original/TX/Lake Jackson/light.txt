About that time the light disappeared, and reappeared on the outside of the scoop of the dipper. It blinked out again and appeared further away and two objects streaked away from the original light, one heading south the other west.  It blinked out again and never reappeared. There was plenty of air trafficnin the sky so someone must have seen it.  They definitely weren't moving like the planes slowly crawling across the sky with pulsing lights.  These lights were constant when seen and brilliant.;29.0382;-95.4416000000001
