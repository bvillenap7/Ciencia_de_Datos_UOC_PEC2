3 flashing, exploding STARS.;2014-10-26 21:30:00;4-5 seconds;3 flashing, exploding STARS. It was dark, approx 8:30 pm.  I was on my front porch, looking across the trees to the East.  I saw 2 STARS almost parallel across from each other, the one on the right was slightly higher. They both FLASHED like a White/Amber Brilliant color.  They looked like an Exploding Firework.  They flashed ONCE at the same time, then went OUT.  Immediately to the left of where they were, another STAR FLASHED, then all went dark.;32.1482;-99.1872
