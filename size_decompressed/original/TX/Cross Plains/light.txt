He went inside and told me to go outside to look. My brother and I sat on the front porch and looked out to the South. Four yellow lights appeared in a perfect line next to each other and I told my brother to go inside and get his phone to record it. He came back and had his phone and I got my phone as well. We called my mom, who wasn't home at the time, and told her. Lights started appearing again but spaced out, so I got my brothers phone and started recording. We caught about 4 on camera. Those disappeared and I called my Aunt who lives down the hill from us and we told her to go outside. She made it out in time to see 7 line up in a perfect line with each other but they disappeared too fast for my brother and I to record.;32.1482;-99.1872
