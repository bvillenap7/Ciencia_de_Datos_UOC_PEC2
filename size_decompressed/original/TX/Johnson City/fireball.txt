I was driving north on the park road approaching the intersection that enters the campground. Not high above the tree line slightly to the northeast I saw a small but brilliant white fireball (reminded me of magnesium burning) going in a slow, straight line from east to west, with an angle around 8 oâ€™clock (slightly downward). It did not have a tail that I remember but it could have had a faint one. The tree line was only a few hundred yards away. I counted it for about 4 seconds when it suddenly disappeared in a slight black wisp of smoke. There was no sound. No fire was started on the ground (I watched that patch of woods for the next 20 minutes and never saw any smoke rising). I immediately reported it to the park office, thinking it was maybe some kids in the campground setting off fireworks, such as a roman candle. But there was no arc on the trajectory, and no color like a roman candle. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));30.2947;-98.3708
