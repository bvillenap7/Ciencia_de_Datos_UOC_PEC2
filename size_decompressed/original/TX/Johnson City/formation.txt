Picture of a formation of 4 objects in the sky, North of Johnston City Texas.;2014-06-05 18:22:00;seconds;Picture of a formation of 4 objects in the sky, North of Johnston City Texas. I drove back from Dallas on Thursday afternoon.  I came back via HWY 281.   Now, right before Johnson, TX, there was a manufactured home slowly being moved South, bringing a line of south bound vehicles to a crawl, sometimes to a dead stop.   I pulled out my camera and started taking random pictures of the clouds and fields around me.   This evening has been my first opportunity to take a look at the photos.  I have 2 pictures that are identical, you can distinctly make out 2 bright items in the sky on the right side and a 3rd just above those.  On the left side is a bright object in the clouds.  I was traveling South and just shooting pictures to the east, I was not even looking through the view finder.  The window was up, but none of the other pictures have these objects on them.   I don't believe, but I certainly question what these objects are in the picture.;30.2947;-98.3708
Many lights in mesh pattern, some autonomous.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-01 20:15:00;45 minutes;Many lights in mesh pattern, some autonomous. 4 adults and 2 kids witnesses a flying mesh of what appeared to be satellites, a LOT of them, Most looked like faint stars, no flashing.  Some followed a non-standard geo-synchronous orbit and appeared to be autonomous.  We felt the presence of a much larger craft and even observed holographic distortions in the sky during this time.;30.2947;-98.3708
