One evening aprox.ten years ago, my wife and I were traveling nort on the west loop 338 in Odessa,Texas.  As we topped the overpass I told my wife look you can see the carnival from here.  What I was refering to was a circular blinking ligts red, green,blue.  It looked like the tilt-a-whirl.  We were a mile or so from where it was.  It turned from almost vertical to horizonital.  Then it rose straight up several hundred feet in the air and took off eastly and went out of sight over the horizon in a flash.  In West Texas the horizon is miles and miles. I asked my wife if she had seen it and she said yes.  About half an hour later we were home and noticed two helicopters heading in the direction of the craft.  I watched the news and nothing was said or mentioned.  Did not know where to report it or who to.;31.8715091633466;-102.370052191235
