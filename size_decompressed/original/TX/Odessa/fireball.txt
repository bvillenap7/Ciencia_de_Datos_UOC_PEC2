I witnessed the event from the back porch of my residence located in north east Odessa, Texas. The large circular mass was moving diagonally in an easterly direction  followed by a long tail.  The object, which was orange or amber in color was moving swiftly upward and then as it began to descend an explosion occurred that lighted up the sky for one or two seconds.  Then the object descended quickly to the east.  The entire incident lasted about 10 to 15 seconds. I would estimate the object as being fairly large, perhaps about one tenth to one fifteenth the size of a full moon.;31.8715091633466;-102.370052191235
