We saw a huge diamond shaped object hovering over us.;1996-10-13 19:47:00;10 minutes;We saw a huge diamond shaped object hovering over us. It was a Monday evening in October of 1996, I'm unsure of the exact date.  My mother(a complete non-believer) and I were traveling east on a major street in town when we saw just ahead, a little beyond the next intersection what looked like several helicopters flying very low, coming toward us.  We discussed the flying machines and decided the white lights which were strobing were much too bright for helicopters.  Just then, two blocks past the intersection, we were right under it.  I turned on the side street and we got out of the car.  The diamond or square shaped as we decided object was just hovering in the sky with no noise.  With every observation I made I asked mother if she agreed and she did.  This thing was huge approximately 600 feet in all directions.  We were underneath and could see the apparent color charcoal. We estimated it was no more than 100 feet above the ground and the lights were at the corners. We could also see individual squares marked off on the underneath side with carvings or writings of some kind we could not identify.  Some time later I saw a celtic cross and thought the artwork was the same or very similar.  We just stood under it discussing it, mesmerized.  Mainly we talked about its size.  A few minutes into it we saw and heard a jet coming down the same main street toward us.  At almost the same time we spotted the jet, the big craft took off in a northwesterly direction being chased by the jet.  I don't know why but we still stood there watching until they were almost out of sight unable to move.  Finally we jumped in the car and gave chase but never saw either again.;31.8715091633466;-102.370052191235

Drove right up to it and under it.  Got out of van and discussed what we were seeing.  Huge diamond shape with brightest strobing white lights I had ever seen, very low to ground, hovering over neighborhood, no sound.  Clearly saw underneath writing or something all under.  Airplane came and ufo streaked off .  Estimated to be 150ftx150ft. , this may be vast underestimation.  No reports.  No radar.  It was huge.  We had plenty of time to examine it. I am a believer and have had one other encounter of disconnected balls of lights examining the car I was in with 3 other people.  My mother on the other hand is a devout disbeliever.  My sanity is intact because she was with me.  The object appeared to be charcoal gray, square or diamond shaped with blinding white strobe lights at the points.  No other colors were observed.  There was a distinct writing or something underneath in circles that covered the bottom.  When we first saw it it was traveling east to west seemingly down a busy street.  It got off the street and turned north and just stopped as if to let us look at it.  It just hovered over a populated neighborhood not doing anything.  It seemed to be about 50 ft. above the houses, very low.  It was huge.  We discussed wondering how such a thing could fly.  From the direction of the airport (east) we saw a very fast flying airplane coming our way.  The thing took off at a high rate of speed north and we gave chase along with the airplane.  We kept it in sight for another 6 miles and then lost it.  I called the airport to ask if anything had been reported and they said no.  I have searched everywhere and cannot find a picture of this thing and wonder if anyone else has seen this particular one.  It took so long to report because I didn't know where and got my computer for Christmas.;31.8715091633466;-102.370052191235

Disappeared when a plane drove under it then reappeared minutes after shining super bright to 4 humans.  Another plane came from opposite direction a while later towards where it was stationed (possibly looking for it).  The bright object got smaller and smaller then disappeared into the night sky.;31.8715091633466;-102.370052191235
