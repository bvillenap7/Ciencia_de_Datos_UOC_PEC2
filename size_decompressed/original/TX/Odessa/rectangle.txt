I was stargazing and at about 8pm with my niece and nephew and we saw a dark rectangular object, with no lights on it with something hanging off the end of it, fly slowly over my house. I could not hear any noises coming from the object. It was visible for about 15 seconds and then it disappeared which to me seemed like it just evaporated because one second it was there moving across the sky then I blinked my eyes and it was gone. My niece got scared and ran inside the house.;31.8715091633466;-102.370052191235
