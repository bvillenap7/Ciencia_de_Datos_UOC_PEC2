They were located  together but to far apart to connected. They never moved they just started quickly fade away. I have never seen anything like this before. Skies are clear.;31.8715091633466;-102.370052191235

Mostly orbs, stars, sparklers Okay. I can't believe I'm going to do this. Here goes.  I have been witnessing since 2014. Mostly orbs, stars, sparklers, weird lights in general. Only once have I seen a solid craft.  I felt compelled to report because I saw something almost exactly like the recent events at Bowling Green and Round Rock.  I saw a line of what I might have dismissed as satellites, but they were in the wrong place.  I stopped counting at some point.  They all appeared out if thin air at a certain point Southwest of Venus.  One after the other they followed the same trajectory and disappeared into nothing after maybe a length of 10-15 degrees(? I can't think of a more objective way to describe the distance).  They weirdest part is that they all flashed at the midway point in their journey. It built up then diminished, not instant like a camera. All at the same spot, just after passing beneath Venus. Only one of the objects fucked up. And there was a brief pause at some point. I easily saw over 40 crafts in the span of ten minutes. I've seen a lot of wild stuff, but nothing like this before.;31.8715091633466;-102.370052191235
