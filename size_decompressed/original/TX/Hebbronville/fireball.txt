Green ball and yellow light;2008-08-11 21:45:00;15 minutes;Green ball and yellow light On the night of August 11, 2008 around 9:45pm (central) I was outside of my house Smoking a cigarette when suddenly a green ball Falling at an angle from west to east, it decreased speed and went straight down. About 15 minutes later, I saw some kind of object come straight up from where The previous one might have landed heading south. At this time (10:45pm) I can see a few blinking lights (red, blue, green) moving slowly across the sky. Maybe it wasn’t a UFO but something is out there and I’m sure the Government knows what it was.;27.3027;-98.6852
