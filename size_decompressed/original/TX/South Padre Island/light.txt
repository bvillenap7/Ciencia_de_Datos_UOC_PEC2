light moving shape of cross over South Padre Island blackest part of night;2008-09-20 23:45:00;30 seconds;light moving shape of cross over South Padre Island blackest part of night I was lying with my back on the beach, stargazing, and trying to catch shooting stars. Several were shooting out from the area of constellation Cassiopeia at the time. A bright star--brighter than any in the constellation--appeared from nowhere in this area of the sky. It moved from this spot in the shape of a cross--up, down, returned to center, left, right, repeat, several times over about 30 seconds, then disappeared after returning to it's original location. Second observation different but same location following night.;26.2411;-97.1915
light bouncing like bumblebee from South Padre Island all the way to Mexico;2008-09-21 23:45:00;10 minutes+;light bouncing like bumblebee from South Padre Island all the way to Mexico I was again lying with my back on the beach, stargazing and watching shooting stars--this time with my husband that thought my report from the day before was crazy: but he saw this one too. (Other report here separate.)  Again, appearing out of Cassiopeia as it's own star, outta nowhere. But this time, the white light moved like a bumblebee or a similar crazed insect, instead of in a cross formation, and lasted until we couldn't follow it due to distance, apparently headed toward Mexico. It was so beautiful and amazing, I didn't think to whip out the camera I actually had on me until after we couldn't follow it.  This event appeared above us, and crossed the entire sky.;26.2411;-97.1915
