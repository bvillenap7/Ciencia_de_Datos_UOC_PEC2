Star visible in broad daylight.;2015-06-14 15:45:00;20 minutes;Star visible in broad daylight. I was sitting on my porch, facing south, at approximately 15:45 hrs., when I sensed I was being watched.  I stood up and faced north and not quite overhead and immediately locked focus on what appeared to be a bright, unmoving star that did not increase or decrease in light intensity.  I stared at it for about 15 minutes and then asked my wife to confirm what I was seeing, which she did.  I used the Star Walk app to determine what was overhead, but the only thing in the spot of the star was a real star called, BeMaine, or GeMaine.  the detail is lost on me, as I can't find it again.   We both watched a further 5 minutes when a small high altitude cloud moved over the star.  When the cloud passed the light was gone.  My wife remarked that I had a bit of a sunburn at the end of the day.  I also did not sleep at all that night.   The light was not visible the next day (Monday).   Seeing the object was not the weird part feeling like I was being watched still! bothers me. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) It was indeed broad daylight with the sun out west a bit and partly cloudy.  Star Walk is an astronomy app that shows planets, constellations, and satellites in relation to the user's position/location on earth.  There was only a star with a strange name where the light was.  No satellites.  Planets were further up overhead. My deepest apologies for not at least attempting a photograph.  Feeling like I was being watched and ending up with a sunburn after 20 minutes outside mostly in the shade is what I find most weird.  I don't burn easily. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) No worries. Approximate location in sky was Elevation 60 degrees Azimuth 33 degrees NE. ((END ADDENDUM));33.1794;-96.9537999999998
