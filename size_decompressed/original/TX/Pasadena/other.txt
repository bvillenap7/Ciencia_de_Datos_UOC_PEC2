Moving Star (white dot) vanished with orange flash.  ((anonymous report));2018-07-04 21:33:00;2 minutes;Moving Star (white dot) vanished with orange flash I was watching the fireworks with my 6 year old son.  I looked away from the fireworks and up at the stars around me.  Suddenly one of the stars started moving at a odd angle and a fast rate of speed.  After about 2 minutes the object dimmed out and I saw a dark orange flash around the area it dimmed.  After that i could not find it in the sky anymore.  I noticed after it disappeared that there was a airplane following the path that the object took. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
