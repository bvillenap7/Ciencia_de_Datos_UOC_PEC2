Large rectangular craft seen New Year's Eve;2001-12-31 18:55:00;1 second;Large rectangular craft seen New Year's Eve I was driving towards the west when I stopped at a stop sign and saw what I thought was an elaborate fireworks show being that it was New Year's Eve. The event lasted one second.After watching the same area of the sky for a couple of minutes I realized what I'd witnessed was not a fireworks display. What I had seen was a huge rectangular shaped object at least 300 yards long and 50 yards wide.It was vertical with several bright white lights inside a red rectangular outer rim.It was about 300 to 400 feet in the air and probably over the city of Pearland Texas which is about 10 miles from where I saw the object.The sky was cloudy that night and I couldn't see any stars.I don't know if it was moving or hovering.The object appeared out of nowhere and the next second vanished.It was incredibly beautiful and I wish I could have observed it longer.I believe it was either a craft or a holograph.Do humans have that kind of holographic ability and if they do why would they show that object and for only one second?Even though it was New Year's Eve I had not been imbibing and was completeley sober.Although after  witnessing the event I could have used a good stiff drink .;29.6739672727273;-95.1781318181817
