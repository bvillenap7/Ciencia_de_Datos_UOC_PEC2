I was traveling south on Beltway 8 south of S.H. 225 at 7:30am.  As I passed over Pasadena Blvd., I saw a gold disc/dome shape object, stationary in the sky, about one mile away.  It quickly shifted from side to side, then disappeared.  Soon after, I saw a black military plane between myself and where the object was.
