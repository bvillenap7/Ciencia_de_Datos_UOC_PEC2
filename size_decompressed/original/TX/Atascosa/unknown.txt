But, it was not a spaceship so to say, but 3 separate objects forming a triangle.  Each of these lights had another light next to it.  Side by side.  They did not flicker, or move out of position.  To me it looked like 1 was low, 1 was in the middle, and 1 was higher up. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we suspect he has observed stars and planets in the southwest sky.  He will consult with a local astronomer.  Date above is approximate, although he states that the objects have been visible for several days in sequence.  PD));29.2702;-98.7376
