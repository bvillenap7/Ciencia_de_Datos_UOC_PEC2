I was outside with my brother. We were actually talking about previous sightings.  I went to the side of the trailer to urinate. As I looked to the left I see a orange/ yellow orb or light headed east from where i saw it. I ran towards my brother so he can see it to, and he did.  It was still headed east.  For more proof, I went inside the house to let everyone know so that they can witness it to.  Now there was 10 of us looking at this UFO.  It turned towards the north and started dimming away quickly.   All my family was pretty scared, I know I was.  We tried capturing it on a phone but my brother was recording a star instead, I was really upset because he missed. and soon after the light disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));29.2702;-98.7376
