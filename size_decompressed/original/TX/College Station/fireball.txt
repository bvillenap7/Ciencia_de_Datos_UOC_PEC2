Green fireball shoots across sky before disappearing.;2016-07-30 22:15:00;5 seconds;Green fireball shoots across sky before disappearing. We were stopped at a light on an intersection, when both of us saw a green fireball shoot across the sky.  At first we thought it was a meteor.  However, when compared to visuals of meteors, the object was vastly different.   Don't exactly know what it was, but that's what makes this a UFO.
