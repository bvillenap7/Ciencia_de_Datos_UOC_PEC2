Bright spherical orb moves across sky with incredible speed before spontaneously disappearing.;2014-12-16 04:00:00;5 seconds;Bright spherical orb moves across sky with incredible speed before spontaneously disappearing. I am a 22 year old male college student currently attending Texas A&M University.  At about 4 AM on 12/16/14 I stepped outside to stargaze on this unusually clear night.  One of my roommates was also outside with me, but looking in a different direction when the event occurred. I was facing east when I noticed a bright white orb of light on the horizon.  It was moving from south to north with extreme velocity. In the course of about 3 seconds the orb-like object continued on itâ€™s path in the West-Northwest direction with speed near that of a shooting star until it spontaneously disappeared from sight ( no visual obstructions). My best estimation, based off of observation, is that the object was between 10,000 and 15,000 ft elevation and moving at least 20x-30x faster than any aircraft I have ever seen. When I first noticed the orb I exclaimed for my roommate to look, and by the time he was facing in the right direction it had just disappeared. This was my first UFO sighting, I figured I should report it especially since I am very curious if anyone else in this area saw it.;30.5803260053619;-96.2931112600536
