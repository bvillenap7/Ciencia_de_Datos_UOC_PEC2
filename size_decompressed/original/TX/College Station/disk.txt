Orange glowing crafts seen over College Station, Tx;2010-10-31 01:25:00;2 hours;Orange glowing crafts seen over College Station, Tx UFO Sighting: College Station, Tx October 31, 2010 1:25 a.m. A group of friends and I were in our backyard around a campfire on a calm clear night when we happened to look up at the sky to see an orange ball of light headed our way.  There were no clouds in the sky and absolutely no wind. At first we thought it had to be a plane but it seemed to move a lot faster and made no noise.  They were bright orange or amber in color and seemed to flicker or glow as they flew over our heads.  They were moving at a very fast speed coming from the South and headed towards North. It took them about 30 seconds from when they came into sight until they flew across the entire sky.  They seemed to be consistently travelling in groups of twos, with the first one being brighter than the second. We were able to make out the dimmer craft following the glowing one to be a disc or circular shaped.  The first time we saw them there were four waves of two crafts per wave. We waited about 30 minutes and a fifth wave came in the same pattern. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
