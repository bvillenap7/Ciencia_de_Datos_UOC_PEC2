The object did not twinkle as one would expect if it were a star. At approximately 0515 my wife and I were driving SSE on Pondrosa St. and at appromixmately 35 degres to the horizon she and I saw an object as discribed above flying in a NNE to SSW direction.It was flying on a 90 degres with the horizon. Ten seconds went by and the object made an abrupt 35 to 40 degre downward turn.. Take a pencil and draw a streight line for a time and then an abrupt turn downward 30 or 40 degres. This what my wife and I saw. I know of nothing that cand move like that. I would conclude that the object was VERT high in altitude. We compared the speed of a jet liner that normally flies at say 30 thousand feet to the speed of this object and figured it was very large and high in altitude. The object was traveling 15 times the speed of a jet airliner if you observe the jet at 30 thousand feet. The objest disappeared over the horizon.

following light;1997-05-15 10:00:00;20 minutes;following light I was going down a back country toad with my husband to get his paycheck and i saw a light in the sky out of my passenger window. It was kinda hazy at times but it was following us.I didnt say anything to my husband because i was unsure of what I was seeing and didnt want to sound crazy. It stayed just above tree level and when we reached the shop my husband went in. I continued to watch it because it was in the field to the side of the shop.I watched it more closely because the light became very bright and started moving up and down side to side very fast.Like someone had a flash light and was blinking it on and off.I remember thinking this is not real and also thinking how I had seen stuff like this on tv.We were on a ranch backroad and all i could think was mutalated cows.Ha Ha! So in that instant all these thoughts were going through my mind I started getting a little afraid and then it was gone.It zoomed off like faster than anything i had ever seen.I kept my mouth shut and didnt say anything to my husband when he came out I think I was in disbelief.

Several bright lights that appear and travel across the sky and then vanish.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars.  PD));2004-10-28 22:00:00;one hour;Several bright lights that appear and travel across the sky and then vanish. I was filming the lunar eclipse on 10/28/04 with my two daughters when we noticed several bright white objects that seemed to be stars but were very close. We thought we could see them flashing red, blue and green. When I zoomed up in on them I was shocked to see that they were pulsating like a welding machine and had red, blue and green flashes. As I zoomed to high power with my digital camcorder you can see a definite counter clockwise rotation and the objects slowly moved upwards from just above the trees up to the 11:00 position. This took at least an hour and the objects flashed intermittently as if communicating with each other. We watched them off and on through the night and at one point there were as many as 8-10 around us with 5 or 6 making a draping effect from the sky down to the top of the trees like a fishing line going to the water. They were east of us in the direction of a microwave tower which is about 3 miles away. Like cars waiting at the gas station. It was strange to say the least. I made a tape of it and took it to work. None knew what it was but we knew what it wasn't. It wasn't swamp gas, ball lightening, an airplane, skylab, and I don't think they were sattelites or planets. But I would like for someone to tell me it is nothing and to sit back down. We have seen them nearly every night since. As well as some other spheres that turn on like spot lights and travel about halfway across the sky and then just turn off. I have seen this three times and my daughter saw it again on Saturday night 10/30/04 and she was scared and believes me now. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars, we suspect, but that is a guess.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source.  Possibly not a serious report.  PD));30.5803260053619;-96.2931112600536

I was going down 2818 (which is a highway by my house) and I looked up in the sky to see if any planes were going to land,because its by an airport.  I looked up and saw nothing,and kept driving.  I then looked up again and saw a blue circular light, first thinking it was a small airplane landing, then taking a second look.When i focused on the light with my eyes it sped away to fast for me to see where it was going.  The light seemed to just disappear into nothing.  My eyes immediately began to water, i wasn't crying and my eyes weren't irritatedthey just started watering.   I got goosebumps and called my mom.  When she tried to call me back there was a call failed message,and then a weird sound.;30.5803260053619;-96.2931112600536

Red/Green orb seen through telescope, tracked from Jupiter W/SW to horizon at incredible speed;2015-03-25 20:30:00;60-90 seconds;Red/Green orb seen through telescope, tracked from Jupiter W/SW to horizon at incredible speed Went stargazing with a friend last night (3/25/15) at Lake Bryan outside of College Station. While using my Celestron Astromaster 114 with 32mm fully coated eyepiece, I was focused in on Jupiter for a minute or so, when a red/green alternating orb flew across my field of view.   I then followed this object, which moved at incredible speed, west (Jupiter was in south sky) until cloud cover prohibited seeing object.   What drew my attention was its curving motion and abrupt changes in speed, from close to a dead stop to full speed almost instantaneously.   The speed of this object was far greater than any aircraft/satellite and could not be seen by naked eye, only through telescope.

Military helicopter following solid white orb.;2015-08-21 00:10:00;1 minute;Military Helo following solid white orb. On the above date and time, I witnessed a solid white ball of light, traveling at a good speed followed by what sounded like a military helo.  The event was seen about 3/4 to 1 mile to my west.   The helo and light was traveling from the SW to N/NE.  I could clearly hear the motor from the helo but no notable sound coming from the white light and no blinking beacons were noted coming from it either.   I first noted the crafts when they were in close proximity to Easterwood Airport in College Station Texas.  The white orb appeared to be gaining distance from the helo.  I have a military and police history.   This was the strangest event I have witnessed;30.5803260053619;-96.2931112600536
