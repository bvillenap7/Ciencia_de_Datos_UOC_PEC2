Bright white light in illuminating cloud in southern sky;2015-01-07 05:45:00;1 minute;Bright white light in illuminating cloud in southern sky This will sound strange but this morning, as I was leaving the house (around 5:45 AM), I was walking toward my car and noticed up in the sky a very bright, white object.  It was illuminating a cloud and appeared like a spot light shining up there.   I turned around and went back in the house to tell my husband to come out and see this thing.  When I came back out and looked again, whatever it was had disappeared.  It wasn't the moon, wrong area of the sky, and it wasn't a street light, too high in the sky, and it wasn't a spotlight, since we live out in the country.  To tell you the truth, I can't even describe the shape other than it was round-like and bright white.;30.5803260053619;-96.2931112600536
