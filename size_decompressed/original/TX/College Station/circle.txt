2 circular lights moving very slowly.;2003-02-23 13:30:00;1 minute;2 circular lights moving very slowly. I saw 2 circular white lights moving very slowly in the sky. Those 2 lights were really close to one another, moving synchronously. It seemed like they are a part of one craft only, because they were almost touching each other. The size of one circle - I would say little bigger than the moon. They were really far up in the sky. At the same time I saw a normal commercial airliner and a jet ( I am not sure about the jet. It looked like a jet. It had a short tail. The kind of jets I have seen usually leave a very long trail. It looked more like a meteor to me, but that too was moving very slowly, so it can not be a meteor.. I guess) I am a skeptic and I do not believe in UFO's. But the more I think about what it was, the more peculiar it gets.;30.5803260053619;-96.2931112600536
Barely visible cicular craft with small red lights that floated independently over the craft like flies.;2008-04-10 21:00:00;5 to 8 seconds;Barely visible cicular craft with small red lights that floated independently over the craft like flies. Making a report of this type is something that I never could have imagined, but I just saw an unexplainable object.  At 9:00 pm, I witnessed a barely detectable object that flew over Texas A&M University at a height normally reserved for military aircraft.  The object was silent, round bodied as large as a jumbo jet, but with strange red lights that seemed to float independently around the fuselage.  The craft was moving slightly faster than an airliner, but again it seemed to float, with no noise and with no normal aircraft lights.  The weird floating red lights where not attached to the aircraft and moved over the aircraft body likes flies.  The craft moved from the south over the college toward the east and the whole flight over the town lasted perhaps 5 to 8 seconds.  In looked like it met up with another object of similar design and then both vanished into the night sky.  It was really strange and I am left completed numbed by the experience.;30.5803260053619;-96.2931112600536
