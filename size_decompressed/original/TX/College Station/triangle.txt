I saw a large possibly triangular shaped craft pass over me with two bright lights behind it.;2004-11-04 10:00:00;2 HOURS;I saw a large possibly triangular shaped craft pass over me with two bright lights behind it. I have been seeing various lights and objects during the past month and reported a sighting to you a week or so ago and gave info to contact me but no response. So this time I will not leave info and we will see what happens. On thursday night I was outside with my video camera looking for another object to film. I saw the usual yellowish orange ball to the east of me when I noticed a blinking light near it. It either came out of it or was circling checking it out. It kind of darted back and forth then slowly headed my way. I filmed it as it passed over a little to the south of me and as it went by I could hear a faint roar like a jet. But the sound kept getting louder behind me instead of in the direction of the objects path as would be expected. I turned around and about 3-400 feet above me was some huge craft several hundred feet across with two large lights in the back of it heading in the direction of the orange ball. At first I thought it was two fighter jets going to look at the ball but soon realised it was one vehicle and it was moving way too slow for a jet. A jet would have fallen out of the sky moving that slow. I jumped around to film it and got about 10 seconds of video before it went behind some trees, that is how low it was. As I watched the video, all but around 3 seconds was jumping and shaking but in slow motion there is definitely something there. But no dicernable shape is visable. But the lights I thought were flames were blinking. They stayed on but blinked intermittently through the white light. It was strange and I showed the video to people at work and they had no answer either. I saw a show on the Phoenix Lights the other night and clear as day was the same type of lights as the object passed overhead. I am open for suggestion and have video footage if you are interested.

22 orange-yellow UFOs, flying low, fast and silently east to south over Texas A&M University 4 randomly moving followed by 18 in a line;2004-12-12 22:15:00;5 minutes;22 orange-yellow UFOs, flying low, fast and silently east to south over Texas A&M University 4 randomly moving followed by 18 in a line December 12, Sunday 2004, 10:15 CST.  My husband and I stepped out for a cigarette and he drew my attention to a formation of 4 objects moving rapidly and silently across the sky over the east side of our building, moving south.  The objects appeared in a diamond formation and at first glance I thought it might have been a large aircraft moving sideways.  The objects then began to circle randomly around each other (2 objects rotated clockwise while 2 others rotated alternate directions around the these) while maintaining course and speed south.  They moved at a steady speed from the time that we saw them from the time they disappeared over the trees on the south side of our complex.  45 seconds to a minute later, while moving around to the other side of our complex, we saw a line of 18 objects in a half V formation, in the same direction (South) as the previous 4.  The objects looked identical in shape, color, and speed as the first 4, but they remained in formation until out of sight well over the far side of the Texas A&M University campus, which we can see from our parking lot.  Again, they flew anywhere from a few hundred to a thousand feet above the ground, with absolutely no noise.  They flew faster than birds and as fast if not faster than a jet airplane.  The objects were in a very very tight formation [nearly touching each other].;30.5803260053619;-96.2931112600536
triangular shaped craft rapid flight then stationary, then rotate (not turn) short rapid flight, stop, rotate, etc., silent;2006-06-01 13:00:00;5 minutes;triangular shaped craft rapid flight then stationary, then rotate (not turn) short rapid flight, stop, rotate, etc., silent Object was triangular in shape and if my memory serves me correctly, it had what appeared to be round balls at the tips of two of the pointed ends. Object would be stationary and rotate, then move rapidly in a direction, stop suddenly, then rotate again, stop, etc. It performed this manuver four or five times. Appeared to move very fast. We watched it for a few short minutes then by the time I left and came back outside with my camera, it had disappeared.

college station V shaped lights.;2008-02-27 09:00:00;30 seconds;college station V shaped lights. My roommate and I were in the back yard when I happened to look up.  Something caught my eye it was dim orangeish lights in the shape of a V heading North-East over us.  It seemed to be low, was complete silent, and moving fairly slow.  We watched in amazement trying to figure out what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  Possible hoax.

Pitch black triangle shaped object travelling across the night sky;2012-10-29 01:40:00;5 seconds;pitch black triangle shaped object travelling across the night sky I work graveyard shift on Texas A&M campus and went outside to smoke a cigarette. It was somewhere between 1:40-1:45 am.  I was looking at the stars noticing that the sky was very clear.  I was looking at Orion's belt when a very subtle &quotshift&quot or motion near it. It was very subtle, but as I focused my attention on it, I noticed it was a perfect v-shape. My instant thought was that it was geese because of the shape, but as I watched I was thinking to myself &quotno way&quot because it was travelling too fast, and the shape was a PERFECT v with no fluctuation. It appeared to be a solid V-shaped object, based on the subtle line of the edge I could distinguish. I could only for certain see the V edges, and not sure about a third edge. It appeared solid and uniform.  I also could not make out any individual birds or wings, nor was there any sound that you would hear when geese fly by overhead. There was no sound at all.  I have never seen a flock of geese fly so perfectly in a v formation and that quickly.  It was  black on black against the night sky. I could barely make it out and would have NEVER noticed if it hadn't come into a very small field of vision while I was looking at the stars. Even as I told myself it must be geese, something about it... I can't put into words ....made me feel like it definitely wasn't. It spooked me. In those few seconds my mind was racing to rationalize it. the V was, however, flying south-east, a direction I assume geese would fly this time of year. But it seemed to be a very large dark triangle/boomerang shaped object flying about the altitude of a regular plane and travelling quickly, maybe similar speed to some planes. I'm not good at giving estimates on size, or even distance in the sky, so could be unreliable on measurements. I only got about 4-5 seconds of being able to see it before it blended into the night sky/too far away.  If it were geese, it seems like they would have been low enough to hear AND see (full or nearly full moon), and the speed was too great. I've never seen geese fly that perfectly in unison, either.  Maybe it was military aircraft??;30.5803260053619;-96.2931112600536
