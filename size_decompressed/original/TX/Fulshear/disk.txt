Giant neon pink, red and orange saucer appears and disappears instantly in Fulshear, Texas.;2011-07-29 01:45:00;2 to 3 seconds;Giant neon pink, red and orange saucer appears and disappears instantly in Fulshear, Texas. I was standing outside in Fulshear, Texas with no light pollution obstructing my view of the stars, when my mother and I noticed a star flickering all different colors.  We watched it for about 15 minutes or so and it never moved, grew in size or disppeared.  We went inside for about 20 minutes trying to figure out if what we had seen was in fact explainable.  When we returned our flickering star had vanished.  We both looked in confusion, so I starred intently in the general area our blicking star had been, just wishing something would appear.  As i starred, I saw a giant bright neon pink, orange and red saucer, silently appear from nothing, shoot down diagonally and disappear in a matter of 2 to 3 seconds.  The colors were swirled in such a way I'd never seen on anything before.  The colorful saucer appeared about 5 times the size of a regular commercial airplane and looked about a mile to a mile and a half away from where I was standing.;29.7217;-95.8977
