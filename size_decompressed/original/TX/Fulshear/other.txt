On January 17, 2008, I was going out to take in the trash cans when I saw a bright strobe light going around through the clouds high in the night sky over my house.  I had not heard the news reports of local UFO sightings yet, so I hadn’t suspected anything unusual.  But when I saw it go by again, I looked for the source.   To my amazement, there was a gigantic dark shape higher than an airplane and about ten times larger.  It was much longer than it was wide, had a pointed head and very unusual indents and I don’t know where the light was emanating from on the craft.  It did not have wings like an airplane.  The clouds covered the vehicle or it sped off before I alerted any more possible witnesses.;29.7217;-95.8977
