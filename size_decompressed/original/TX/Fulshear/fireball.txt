flashing ball of light in the sky;2000-07-26 23:15:00;5 seconds;flashing ball of light in the sky I was sitting outside when I noticed a light flashing above me.  My first thought was that it was lightning, but it was a cloudless night.  I then was able to locate the source of the bright light and saw a ball of light in the western sky.  This ball of light was half the size of the moon and located above the Big Dipper.  The object seemed stationary and there was no tail or streaking seen.  It looked to me like a giant explosion way out in space.  I contacted local news agencies with no one else reporting what I had.  I am not sure what it was that I saw, but it sure was excting to experience something so unusual. ((NUFORC Note:  The description is somewhat reminiscent of the flash of an Iridium satellite, although Iridiums are not stationary.  A check of the Heavens-Above website would anwer whether an Iridium was in the area at the time.  PD));29.7217;-95.8977
