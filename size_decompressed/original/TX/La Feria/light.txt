I went back to call my neighbors so they could witness it with us. We could not tell what shape it was because it was shiny white, bigger than the North star.  It came up from the South, moving in a northeast direction, then disappeared off into the distance. I've seen these kind of moving objects a few times before but usually witnessed them by myself or with my daughter. It was a fun experience.;26.1698;-97.8305
