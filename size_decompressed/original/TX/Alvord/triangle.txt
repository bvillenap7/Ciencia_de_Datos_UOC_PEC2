3 green lights triangle Alvord, Texas.;2016-10-22 20:00:00;3 minutes;3 green lights triangle Alvord, Texas. I was on my way back home from New Mexico about an hour drive from where I'm at... middle of nowhere Texas.  2 lane highway and the only lights are those from your car.  I was driving until up ahead in the sky there was like a green orb.  It just dropped down.  I didn't think anything of it until it shot back up and then down again.  At this point my mind goes blank.  What did it for me was when it shot up the 2nd time not to mention it's speed it started doing it from side to side.  That's when I knew it wasn't normal.  Yes the idea crossed my mind to pull over and try getting it on video until it started flying towards me as I was driving towards it.  At this point I'm at 40mph on a 75mph and when the vehicle started merging on he too slowed down next to me.  It flew right past us and it was so low down you could see what it was.  There was 3 greenish lights.  One on the front and two on the back one on each side.  It was like a triangle.  And when you see something like that up and personal sorry.. your instinct isn't to stop and take videos more like press the gas and take off.  Which was precisely what I did.;33.3663;-97.6897
