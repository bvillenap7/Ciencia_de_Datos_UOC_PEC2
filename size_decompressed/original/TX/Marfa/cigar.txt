Steady cigar shape light cruises under Moon at speed with no sound or blinking.;2007-08-22 20:40:00;10 minutes;Steady cigar shape light cruises under Moon at speed with no sound or blinking. 	I was looking toward the moon at sunset when I noticed a light under the moon traveling east to west. It was “cigar” shaped (thin rectangle with rounded edges). Its speed and angle seemed comparable to an airliner at first, but there was no con trail anywhere in behind it. No sound was heard even after taking into account the time delay in hearing a jet flying over. I pointed it out to a friend. We both considered that it might be a normal aircraft, but out here, if you can see it you will here it. 	I went inside and checked a web site that displays aircraft flights and the only flight near our area was going south, not west. I grabbed our camera, put the optical zoom as high as it would go and took a photo. It continued on quietly and steadily until I couldn't see it anymore.;30.293;-104.0848
