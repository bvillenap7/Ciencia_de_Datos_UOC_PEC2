Digital photo of possible flying triangle over Marfa Tx 10-28-2003;2003-10-28 20:24:00;Photo shot;Digital photo of possible flying triangle over Marfa, Tx 10-28-2003 In 2003 I was in Marfa TX and took several digital photographs of the amazing sunset.  Yesterday, while reviewing these photos on a much larger computer screen, I noted what I had missed initially, i.e., among the clouds the appearance of a triangle of evenly spaced, round circles which, because of their regularity in spacing and shape could be judged to be non-clouds.  Thisformation of circles is adjacent to two very bright cloud formations which seem much brighter than the surrounding clouds. I note that there are no other reports of sightings from this area during this period, so I am reluctant to conclude that they are actually a flying triangle, but it is hard to dismiss this possibility when looking at the photo.;30.293;-104.0848
Silent unknown triangle aircraft with white and red lights seen near Marfa, TX.;2015-04-03 21:00:00;15 minutes;Silent unknown triangle aircraft with white and red lights seen near Marfa, TX. We were at the Marfa Lights viewing platform between Alpine and Marfa TX on April 3, 2015 at about 9:30 pm. Not having any luck with seeing the famous Marfa Lights, we were about to go back to our hotel in Alpine.  One member of our group then turning back north to walk to the car noticed something flying from North to South just to the East of us. The were no stars out as it was cloudy, windy and cold.  As the craft got even with us, we noticed it had three white lights that formed a perfect equallateral triangle. These white lights never blinked.  Directly in the middle of the three white lights was a red blinking light. It blinked about once a second.  The craft proceeded south below the cloud deck.  After about 5 minutes it turned right to the West and began to speed up. It then finally turned back North where it appeared to disappear into the clouds. There was absolutely NO sound produced by the aircraft as it flew over.  I have a IPhone app that tracks commercial flights and none were in our area.  The other odd thing about the craft is that it seemed to move in a very straight line (ie no movements due to wind) except for when it turned and made no sounds. I live in the landing path of a major international airport and see planes land both day and night all the time. I have never seen anything like what we saw this night.;30.293;-104.0848
West Texas Triangle UFOs;2018-07-19 22:00:00;20 minutes;West Texas Triangle UFOs Witnessed two silent and large craft fly over the Marfa lights veiwing area east of Marfa, TX.  The craft each had three white non-blinking lights at the tip of an equilateral triangle with a blinking red light in the center.  They flew over from north to south.  They maneuvered towards the south and then began to follow each other close to the horizon at a high rate of speed going east.  I have video and screenshots of one of the craft. I checked an ap on my iPhone X that indicated there were no commercial aircraft in the vicinity that would have been visible during the sighting.  There is a strong possibility that this was some kind of advanced military aircraft.  That being said, it met the classic description of the widely seen and reported black triangle UFO.;30.293;-104.0848
