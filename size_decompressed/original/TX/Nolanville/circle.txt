On August 27 at exacltly 10:23 PM I see a bright ball of light flying around pretty fast. I recoreded it for one minute and I see another ball of light too. On August 29, I see the same thing, but only one. I record it again, but this time I zoom in. It was weird looking. Later I realized I started recording the exact same time, 10:23 PM.;31.0808;-97.5915
