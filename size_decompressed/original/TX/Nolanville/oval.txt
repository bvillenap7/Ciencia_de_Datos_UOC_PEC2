5 lights moving at same speed and changing places without pattern or any noise;2005-11-05 22:45:00;20 sec;5 lights moving at same speed and changing places without pattern or any noise I was out in backyard between 10:45 and 11:00pm on Sat. Nov. 5th, 2005, when saw bright shooting star in the northern sky.  I grabbed lawnchair and decided to watch a while just in case I could see another before going to bed.  I saw an oval shaped darkened oject moving very slowly and without sound.  I thought I was seeing things because it covered the small visable stars as it crossed the sky.   The oject had 5 lights, all amber in color.  They did not blink and were constant.  The lights appeared to be trading places in very graceful dance-like movements but never moved the same way twice.   I know that we are close to Fort Hood, and after living here more than 20 years, have never seen anything like this.  I dont know what I saw, only that it took all my breath away.  I was reluctant to even tell anyone and be labled a nut but I know I saw something.  I watched this object move slowly accross the sky and had I been able to stand without my knees knocking, I would have tried to follow oject for a longer look.;31.0808;-97.5915
