S/SW SKY ABOUT 20°. July 6 2016 10:05pm, watering a bush in my yard looking down a flash from above.  ((anonymous report));2016-07-06 22:05:00;5 MINUTES;S/SW SKY ABOUT 20°.  July 6, 2016, 10:05pm, watering a bush in my yard looking down a flash from above caught my eye.  Looked up saw nothing.  Only an empty patch of sky.  Figured a porch light in the distance had glared off my glasses.  Continued watering.  About 1 minute later exact same thing happened again.  So I put the hose down and just stared into the clear patch of sky. Within about 1 minute, a pinpoint of light appeared out of nowhere, immediately expanded to about the size of a small dinner plate and then shrank back out to nothing.  I was completely floored.  I immediately texted my wife to come outside.  I turned on my phone video and pointed it in that direction and waited.  Within about a minute it happened again.  Once again I was completely floored.  I continued recording although I couldn’t be sure if I was catching the right area with my phone the screen was just black.  Within about 1 more minute it happened again for the last time just before my wife arrived. I continued recording a few more minutes but nothing happened. It had an orange tint.  It appeared in the same place as far as I could tell. It was not traveling at all and appeared extremely rigid in place.  It didn’t cast any light down. It appeared out of empty sky as a pinpoint of light expanded, shrank to nothing in less than 2 seconds.  There seemed to be a slight pause between it appearing as a pinpoint and then beginning to expand.  To me it at full size it resembled the lens of one of those stage lights that hang above a theatre stage and have a circular pattern in the lens.  There was no sound.  There were no clouds and the sky around and behind it was very clear.  It was not a planet, or an iridium flare, helicopter, drone or anything else like that. IT WAS STATIONARY. IT APPEARED IN THE SAME PLACE 5 TIMES IN ABOUT 5 MINUTES. IT LOOKED EXACTLY THE SAME ALL 3 TIME I SAW IT DIRECTLY.  IT EXPANDED TO A SIZE MUCH GREATER THAN ANY OTHER OBJECT IVE EVER SEEN IN THE NIGHT SKY EXCEPT THE MOON. IT MADE NO SOUND. IT CAST NO LIGHT ON THE GROUND.  THERE WAS NO TAIL OR FIRE OR SMOKE. IN MY JUDGMENT IT WAS WAY UP OR OUT THERE.  THE SKY WAS CLEAR ALL AROUND IT.  I COULD CLEARLY SEE THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE ANYWHERE IN THAT PATCH OF SKY. My video captured only one small instantaneous blip. Nothing like what I actually saw.  No one else in my area ever reported seeing it as far as I know.  I would have thought many people would have seen it as well.  I want to know that someone else saw it too as I am beginning to question my own recollection even though my video proves something did appear.   Thanks for reading this….
