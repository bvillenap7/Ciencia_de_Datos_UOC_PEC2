I was just sitting outside  looking at Venus with my telescope.  My brother was in the shop, working on his bike.  Out of the corner of my eye I saw a triangle shaped craft, with four lights on the bottom and two mid center.  The lights were kind of dim, almost unoticable.  It flew over the moon, heading north over the shop.  As it moved, it seemed to merge togther. It moved about 20 mph.   Then it was gone.  I was muttering, oh my god. the whole time.  My brother ran out of the shop, but by the time he did, it was gone.  Mnay dogs were barking, and planes had been flying around the area before the sighting.  When i woke up, a scar mark was on my back.  It had never been there before.  Two deeper scratches had been there, but were now gone.  The scar seemed to be like stitches into my back.  I live close by to a military base.;31.1993000000002;-97.9304000000003
I have seen alot of aircrafts fly by my house because i live near Fort Hood, and never did my radio go out.;2009-03-22 11:30:00;5 min;I have seen alot of aircrafts fly by my house because i live near Fort Hood, and never did my radio go out. Me and my close friend where returning to my home when we spotted a weird shaped and silent object hoovering in the sky. It was quite big, the biggest flying object ive ever seen. It made several turns without banking like a normal aircraft, and kept constant speed as it turned. We watched it for about five min. Also the radio went in and out a couple times before it dissappeared into the night sky. We also noticed about six or seven helicopters following it about two to three miles apart.;31.1993000000002;-97.9304000000003
Triangle shaped craft with six lights flying silently at approx 250 mph at 550 ft traveling north to south.;2011-09-05 21:25:00;30 seconds;Triangle shaped craft with six lights flying silently at approx 250 mph at 550 ft traveling north to south. On the evening of 5 September 2011 my wife and I decided to take a walk on our street.  As we stepped out into the yard we noticed what appeared to be two satellites passing very high in the sky.  The first appeared very bright and travelled away from the direction of the moon as it went it dimmed as it should when it exceeded the reach of the suns light.  The second was flying perpendicular to the first. Rather than travel in the typical straight line it made a minor deviation in it flight path but still continued in the same general direction.  It appeared to first turn right then left again and still maintained its general course.  After discussing the satellites for a moment we started our walk travelling northwest down the street. We walked and talked about random things and revisited the satellite topic which prompted us to look up frequently. We walked about three blocks down the street and through a lit intersection. Just beyond the intersection the street turned dark again.  It was then that my wife said “Oh my god, check that out.” I followed her finger into the sky and immediately locked onto the object as it flew towards us from the north. It was a triangle of dim white lights with a slight blue hue, six of them arranged in an equilateral triangle. I would estimate its speed between 200-300 mph at an altitude of 500-600 ft. I track the craft as it flew directly over our heads north to south in the direction of the moon. As its path brought it closer to the moon its shape started to become visible. I covered the moon with my hand to continue viewing the craft, as I did the craft began to bank west. When it banked the last light on the left and the center light disappeared with the perspective cha! nge making the craft chevron shaped. At no time did either of us hear any rotor noise of the sound of a jet craft. The moon light made brought out a solid blocky body surrounding the lights. I am an active duty Army Aviation Soldier with three combat tours and have seen almost every known aircraft including the B-2 spirit. This craft was unlike anything else I have ever seen. Absolutely silent, fast and I would estimate its width to be approx 100 yards based on the profile of a C-5 at roughly the same altitude. The conditions were clear, windless with a half moon.;31.1993000000002;-97.9304000000003
