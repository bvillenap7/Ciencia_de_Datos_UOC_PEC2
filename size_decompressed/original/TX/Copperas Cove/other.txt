2 to 3 dozen white lights in an unorganized wing or boomerang formation moving from north to south with no sound;2011-09-30 21:07:00;10 seconds;2 to 3 dozen white lights in an unorganized wing or boomerang formation moving from north to south with no sound On 30 SEPT 2011, approx 2107 hrs, I went outside my house at 212 Dewald St. Copperas Cove TX to smoke when I saw from the north heading south from a east side my porch two dozen to three dozen lights in the form of a wing or boomerang. I could not see the out line of a craft but only the white lights within that form traveling at a high rate of speed with absoluty no sound. I could not believe what I saw so, as it was passing by I ran inside to grab my phone to record it. It only took about two seconds but when I got outside it had passed so fast that I could not get my video online to record and the lights could no longer be seen as they faded very fast. The lights seemed to be low. I see aircraft like the air force C5 land at Ft. Hood/Killeen international airport all the time since I am only a few miles from it and the large aircraft go so slow and make a great noise that it can not be mistaken for anything else. Furthermore the UFO In saw traveled without sound and west of that landing area and continued south until out of sight. I work on ft hood as a civilian police officer and was off duty at the time. I have seen many aircraft from large military planes to civilian planes as well as many combat helicopters flying in formation over ft. hood. The lights that I saw were so unorganized within the pattern of a huge wing or boomerang like shape that it could not have been a formation planes or helicopters to travel so many miles from the north to the south and out of sight in just 10 to 15 seconds without sound and not landing at the ft hood/ Killeen airport. As I have said, I have seen many aircraft both civilian and military in the area to include the largest of all.  Galaxy C5 aircraft and this is truly the first stunning UFO that I have ever seen as an adult.;31.1993000000002;-97.9304000000003
