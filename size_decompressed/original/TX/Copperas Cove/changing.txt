Shift and Light Shifting object high over Copperas Cove, Texas.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2009-01-23 20:00:00;20 minutes;Shift and Light Shifting object high over Copperas Cove, Texas I walked outside my home at 10PM last night to let the dogs do their business.  While out, I was looking around the sky because there seemed to be very few stars out.  When I looked West, I saw a lone bright object which appeared to be about the height of a high flying plane.  Although I expected it to move across the sky until it was out of sight, it didn't move.  Then as I was watching, it turned from a white light to a red light, then back to white.  It wasn't really blinking as it stayed approximately one color for a minute or two before changing to the other. I went inside and got my binoculars and came back out.  Looking through the lens, it appeared to go from round to long and back to round.  That was coordinated with the light changes.  My wife was expected home so I went inside to wait for her and show her the object so that I would have verification.  About 10 minutes later, I went back out with her but the object was gone.
