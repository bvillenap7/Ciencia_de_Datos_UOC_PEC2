UFO Observance, 15 SEP 04, South Southwest of Copperas Cove, Texas;2004-09-15 21:30:00;5 minutes;UFO Observance, 15 SEP 04, South Southwest of Copperas Cove, Texas At approx. 2130 hrs. (CST), 15 SEP 04, in SSW direction from Copperas Cove, Texas a UFO (glowing and blurry elongated object) moved at multiple velocities in an east-west direction back and forth.  The movements were accompanied by altitude adjustments as well.  Movements were further characterized by rapid (erratic) changes in direction.  The object appeared to have mostly a reddish glow to it however at times it appeared yellowish.  The object appeared and made numerous movements and then vanished however it would reappear shortly after (perhaps 15 seconds) again.  Observed several occurrences of this object then decided to request three other family members to come outside to observe the object.  Again 4 of us observed several iterations of the object moving.  This started a long discussion on what we thought this object could have been.  The object did not move with the characteristics of a standard aircraft or helicopter there was no accompanying sound.  I suspected that the object was several miles from our location however, other family members were not so sure.  No photos were taken.  Bottom Line:  This was a UFO sighting for sure I have not previously witnessed any known objects with its appearance or flight characteristics.;31.1993000000002;-97.9304000000003
