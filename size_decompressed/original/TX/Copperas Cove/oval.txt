Shiny, Oval object...didn't move for 2 minutes, then disappeared.;2009-06-21 10:30:00;2 minutes;Shiny, Oval object...didn't move for 2 minutes, then disappeared. It was about 10:30am when I was driving home from town when something VERY shiny caught my eye.  At first I marked it off as an airplane, but after a few seconds I noticed it hadn't moved.  I slowed my driving to about 20 so I could focus on it better and realized that it was NOT a plane.  It was pretty far away from me, low to the ground though, but it looked big.  It was so shiny, but I could tell the craft was a grey/silver color.  I stared at it for about 2 minutes and the whole time it did NOT move, I looked away from it long enough to look at the road and back up and it was gone. My husband thinks I was seeing things....I don't know what it was...but all I can say is whatever I saw WAS there! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.
