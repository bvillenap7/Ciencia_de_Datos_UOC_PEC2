Flying Garbage Can?????;2021-05-05 13:00:00;2 minutes;Flying Garbage Can????? Not to sure I should be doing this. People gonna think I’m crazy but I have to tell someone. I was out fishing in my kayak and I seen something that caught my eyes. It was above me for a few seconds then it went towards the north. Almost as fast as a blink. What I saw was something strange. It looked like a galvanized tin garbage can. It appeared to only be the size of a small car but it was fast as hell when it shot straight up out of view. Almost like it knew I was watching.  Unfortunately there was no lights, sounds, or any little green men but it kinda freaked me out. This isn’t spam, or a joke. The metal on the aircraft was bright like stainless steel. I know it sounds silly saying I witnessed a flying garbage can,,, but I did.;30.3540051724138;-95.0831275862069
