V-shaped multicolored lights on some Craft.;2012-03-23 20:00:00;about 10 min.;V-shaped multicolored lights on some Craft. No one will believe me but I saw something very interesting tonight, on my way home from Dayton TX USA, going to Cleveland TX USA   I saw what at first looked like an airplane but as I got closer it seemed to be hoovering just about a 1/4 of a mile.  When I got where it felt like I was right under it I confirmed it was definitely not moving forward or any other direction.  The craft looked like a v shape and had different colored lights that looked like they were chasing each other.   When I got home I was a little shaken but also excited what if you know;30.3540051724138;-95.0831275862069
