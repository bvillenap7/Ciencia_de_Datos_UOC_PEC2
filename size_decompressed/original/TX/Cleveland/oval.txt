I looked to the northwestern sky at the time/date/location indicated.  I observed a single, very piercingly white light (about the size of the end of a Q-tip cotton swab) sitting motionless well above the horizon.  As I focused on this object, it quite suddenly became dark & displayed an illuminated, skeletal type structure glowing a soft orange color. A few seconds later, it vanished.... It didn't fly away, IT VANISHED. No sound of any kind was heard coming from what ever this was.  I am 62 & a professionally trained observer. I have been an amateur astronomer most of my life. What I witnessed will disturb me for as long as I live.... Fear of the unknown.;30.3540051724138;-95.0831275862069
