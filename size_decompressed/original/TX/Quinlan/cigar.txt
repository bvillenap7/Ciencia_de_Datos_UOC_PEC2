It was late, between midnight and 1 in the morning. The moon was out and the sky was partly cloudy.   My wife was looking out the window of my truck and noticed the outline of an cigar shaped object and it appeared to have dimmly lit, almost like a fluorescent light on the bottom.  The light was round, maybe 16 to 24 ft.???  My wife was decribing it to me while I was driving and looking for a place to pull off and get out to see for myself.  I then pulled into a gravel drive at an old store.   I left the motor running and got out of my truck. And just like my wife had said, there it was,completely silent, the outline was very clear.  It was perhaps, 400 to 600 yards away. And I noticed it was hovering over some very large power lines. This thing was right on top of them.   When I got out of my truck to look at it and only seconds later this dim, fluorescent type light which was on the bottom of the UFO, turned off.  This scared my wife, She was very upset telling me to hurry and get in the truck.  She was ready to go.   I had a flashlight in my truck and I wanted to flash it on the object, however my wife wouldn't let me.I got back into my truck and started down the highway, no sooner than I on the road again the light on the UFO came on again.  I wish I knew what it was, it looked gray under the moonlight.  It gave off no sound. I think it being over those powerlines had something to do with it being there.  And it was strange, that when I got out of my truck, it turned the light off. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));32.8975;-96.123
