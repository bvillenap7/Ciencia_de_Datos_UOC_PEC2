Y Shaped Golden light formation stationary in the sky.;2012-01-29 20:00:00;5 minutes;Y Shaped Golden light formation stationary in the sky. My mother and I were driving into Quinlan on Highway 34 from Greenville.  As we came into town we noticed a shape of lights in the sky.  It was an almost Y shaped formation of several individual lights, they were a golden color and stationary.  Then the one on the very bottom of they Y began floating downward extremely slowly, as if in slow motion.  From there, the entire formation began to fall apart and go different directions, I cannot say how long the formation was there before we saw it, but the time from us seeing it to its disappearance was only a matter of a couple minutes, it was there and gone quickly.;32.8975;-96.123
