bright star like object moving around moon in the day time;2017-04-30 05:00:00;3 minutes;bright star like object moving around moon in the day time I 36 and my son 4 star gaze every night before bed. I grew up on lake Michigan, lived in Arizona and now in Texas. I've looked at the stars since I was very little and I've seen every explainable thing out there.  I don't know what I saw but I know nothing in the sky could move like this.  It looked exactly like a very bright star or planet you see in the night sky.  If the moon appeared to be an inch wide it was stationary three inches above and one to the right.  I grabbed my son and showed him the bright star or planet by the moon in the day time.  I wanted him to see stars and planets and the moon could be seen in the day.  Then it started moving below the moon. about two inches in  straight line.  So no concern.  It was when this very bright star moved two inches to the right then down and to the left.  Then back up and to the left (passing the left side of the moon)then just disappeared.  It looked like a very bright white star the entire time. (very obvious);30.1713;-97.6152000000001
