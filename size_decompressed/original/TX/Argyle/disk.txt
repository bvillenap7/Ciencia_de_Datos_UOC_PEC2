Slow moving object, hovering around highway, flashing lights, no noise low altitude;2009-01-14 01:08:00;6 minutes;Slow moving object, hovering around highway, flashing lights, no noise low altitude 1:08 am, heading north bound 35w. i saw a very bright white/semi colorful light floating on right side of highway, what seemed to be right above a water tower (the water tower had a red glowing light on top). i thought it was unusual that it hardly moved or did not move at all. I continued driving down the highway, at 1:11 A.M. i got a closer look. I could not make out a shape at all there seemed to be a flashing red light, on my left side of the object, white in the middle, and blue on right. I heard no noise coming from the object. It seemed to hover very slowly adjacent to me on my right, almost staying with my speed, then take an immediate turn over me and across the highway. On what i can assume would be the backside of the object, i saw a fast set of flashing lights from right to left, there seemed to be about four to five flashing lights. It had a slight angle from top left to bottom right, while floating straight ahead over a tall hill out of sight. After continuing my drive, i stuck my head out the window, and saw the object just floating passed the hill very slowly, until it was once again out of sight at about 1:14 A.M. It was a cloudless night, in an area where there is no light pollution from surroundings;33.107;-97.1597999999999
