Triangle shaped lights slowly fade out and disappear.;2004-12-11 22:00:00;10-20 seconds;Triangle shaped lights slowly fade out and disappear. Traveling west bound on I-30 just outside of Greenville TX, noticed what appeared to be 3 bright stars in a triangle shape above the horizon.  The lights appeared stationary, and they emitted the same white light of a star, just much brighter.  My wife first noticed them the same time I did.  After a few seconds, all three lights slowly faded out until they were gone.  I thought at first perhaps it was a plane that made a turn and we had simply lost view of the lights.  However, we both continued to look in the area the lights were last seen, and saw nothing else, nor were there any tall buildings or other structures around.
