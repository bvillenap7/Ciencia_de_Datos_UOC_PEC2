I stepped out of my cabin and saw this. It went from one end of the horiaon to the other in about five seconds.: it looked like a star towing another star with a thin line of weakly glowing wire.  I'm betting this is one of ours, or maybe Russian. But it cruised right across the sky in about five seconds, from one side of the horizon down to the other. This was 2 AM, so it was in Earth's shadow, right? So why did it glow?  Anybody else ever seen one of these?  This was in Sabial County, North Texas, no lights anywhere. Everything is blocked off by hills and it was very faint. I keep thinking it was a satellite, but it was definitely towing something. I could see the connecting line. The tow line was about half a thumb long, come to think of it. Maybe an inch?  It was was all very bluish and faint. But it cruised right over the horizon from one end to the other, and the towed object swung slighly like it was on a pendulum bob.  Um, juast wanted you guys to know. I'll check back later.  Please tell me if anyone else ever saw anything like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));29.5972;-99.5585
