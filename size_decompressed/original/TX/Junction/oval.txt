Unidentified black object flying next to I-10, 10 minutes West of Junction, TX.;2001-09-23 22:58:00;7 seconds;Unidentified black object flying next to I-10, 10 minutes West of Junction, TX. Witnessed an unidentified black object flying next to I-10 in Texas. We were 10 minutes West of Junction, TX. I was watching the sky and saw a black craft flying high above. I tried viewing it with a 7x35 binoculors but could not get a detailed image, it was blurry and the thing was moving fast. I could only view for around 7 seconds. It wasn't up as high as jetliners normally fly, and was definately moving quick. It seemed to have picked up speed as I watched it. Was definately very black in color. Was up above some of the fluffy clouds in the sky. It was a very nice, sunny day. I was headed East, it was moving West. I was sitting in the passenger seat of the car. We were travelling 70 mph. Looked oval/round in shape.;30.4754;-99.7473
