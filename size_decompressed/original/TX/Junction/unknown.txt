Two lumious objects observed near Junction Texas.;2006-09-20 00:30:00;25 seconds;Two lumious objects observed near Junction Texas. While star gazing at South Llano State Park my buddy and I were taking a break, relaxing in lawn chairs when I glanced north to see 3 objects lined up almost verticaly, with a slight curve.  The two lower objects were very bright about -1 magnitude (twice as bright as Vega) and the third object on top was less so.  Acoording to my buddy he had observed this for 20 seconds or so trying to determine what it was.  As I glanced over at it the top object began to move in a south westerly direction while the other two stayed stationary and very luminus.  After five more seconds I raised my 10x50 binoculars to my eyes to get a better look and the two lower lights vanished while the third, top light moved away in a northerly direction.;30.4754;-99.7473
