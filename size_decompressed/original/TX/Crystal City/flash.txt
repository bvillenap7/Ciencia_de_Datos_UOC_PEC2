Extremely bright bursts of white light moving at high speed approx. 200 feet above the ground.;2014-01-15 20:45:00;5 seconds;Extremely bright bursts of white light moving at high speed approx. 200 feet above the ground. I observed extremely bright light bursts moving at very high speed approximately 200 feet above the ground. The bursts were approximately 1/2 mile away. The terrain was flat pasture land and the bursts were 2 inches above the horizon by line of sight. I was traveling north on FM 1433 at 50 mph when I observed the first flash to my west.  I immediately stopped my vehicle and observed three more bursts of white light moving south before the source moved out of sight.  There was no sound or shape associated with the light source.  I can only describe it as an intermittent burst of extremely bright white light.   The source moved from 10 o'clock to 6 o'clock in 5 seconds and flashed 4 times in that distance. This occurred in a very low population rural farming area.   I am a ((age deleted)) year old male with a background in law enforcement.;28.6885;-99.8278
