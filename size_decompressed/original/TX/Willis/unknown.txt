Bright flashing star like object hovering in the sky.;2006-08-25 23:30:00;45 minutes or more;Bright flashing star like object hovering in the sky. It was too far to tell what it looked like. What we saw looked like a really bright star. It was hovering in the same spot for about 45 minutes. It was white and flashing blue and red lights. We had to go in the house and when we came back to check it was gone. I just want to know if anyone else saw this or if there are any kind of radars in the sky in my area that night. It was definately not a commercial aircraft. I think we were looking North and it was not real high in the sky.;30.4407325;-95.513045
