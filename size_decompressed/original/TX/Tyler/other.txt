Large ship with no sound and no lights passing over my apt complex;1986-09-15 20:00:00;10 seconds;Large ship with no sound and no lights passing over my apt complex I went out of my apartment complex jogging in early evening and when I returned back to the pool area, I sensed a movement above me. I looked up and a large object was moving over my head. However, there were no lights and no noise. It blackened out the sky as it went over me and this only lasted a few seconds. It was so close that I couldn't see the whole of it but my mind recognized it as the shape of an aircraft (without the wings)...I hesitate to say cigar shaped because it was so close over my head that I couldn't see the full shape. It was like being in a row boat and suddenly turning around and seeing a large cargo ship float 50 feet in front of you (with no noise or lights)...you can only see a mass chunk of it. This experience has mystified and haunted me for 15 years. I guess I'll never know exactly what that was. But I remember feeling a tremendous respect and reverence for it as well as a feeling of wonderment and amazement. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.3101019138756;-95.2988856459329
