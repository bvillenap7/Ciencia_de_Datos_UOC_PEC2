Red/Orange Fireball Moving Over Tyler, TX at Speed of Airplane;2010-07-10 21:25:00;5 minutes;Red/Orange Fireball Moving Over Tyler, TX, at Speed of Airplane I, my sister, and my two sons saw something over Tyler, TX, around 9:25 PM on July 10, 2010.  The sky was not completely dark yet.  My sons and I were in the pool.  I put my head back to dip my hair into the water... when I saw a bright red glow approaching from the distance.  One of my sons saw it at the same time, and we both said, What is THAT?   It was traveling at the speed of a plane, and as it approached..  my younger son and I saw something behind the glow...  almost like a parachute shape, but translucent looking.  My son said it looked like  a glare on something behind the light.  But then that shape went away, and all we saw was a red fireball.  By this point, it looked like a plane on fire.  My older son called for my sister to come outside.   We stood in shock.. it looked like a plane in flight that was in flames.  We were scared because we thought it was a plane on fire and we were just waiting for it to fall... and my mind was thinking, How can a plane st! ill fly if it's on fire?... but it continued on in the distance until it could no longer be seen.  Once it was gone, we realized that it could not have been a plane because there was no noise, but it was moving in the direction that we had seen planes coming from earlier.  There were NO OTHER reports of this to the local news station when my sister called, and no one else I know saw it.  People keep saying it was a weather balloon or hot air balloon that we must have seen.  Yeah right.  I've seen both, and this was neither.;32.3101019138756;-95.2988856459329

It was bright orange but flickered like a candle.  It just hung in the sky, barely swaying back and forth for about a minute.   Then it seemed to vanish to a tiny pin point dot and disapeared.   While it was disappearing it seemed to move up and right very fast, but the course it took wasn't followed easy because it disapeared so quickly.;32.3101019138756;-95.2988856459329
