I observed a golden sphere in the southwestern sky at about 5:30 am moving slowly north.;2000-07-28 05:30:00;5 seconds;I observed a golden sphere in the southwestern sky at about 5:30 am moving slowly north. I observed a sphere in the southwestern morning sky while walking my two dogs.  It was still quite dark and my first glimpse was interrupted by one of the dogs.  I looked back at the object and it had moved.  I knew it wasn't a star.  I watched it for at least 5 seconds while it moved slowly north.  One second it was there then it was gone. It made no sound and there were no aircraft in the sky.  It was perfectly round.  The edges were very distinct.  It appeared to be a light, but it did not have a beam of light or any rays around it.  The color wasn't gold like glitter gold, but a muted golden color. This is the third sphere I've seen.  The first one was in the fall of 1995.  That happened on a cloudy day and the globe/sphere was below the cloud deck.  It performed the typical slipping through the atmosphere with the zig zag motion of a saucer (if there is anything typical about a saucer).   I was on a hill and was a little above this object when I observed it around 7 pm. The second time I saw a sphere/globe was January 4, 1996.  I was watching for meteors because that is supposed to be a peak day for a meteor shower.  This one was exactly as the first description, except closer.  There was no tail and no flame. It was doing that slipping through the atmosphere, well air.  It wasn't that far away and again I wasn't looking up.  I was level with it. It did that zig zag movement,also.  At the time I thought it was just a strange meteor, because I didn't know better.  Soon afterwards I got online and began my own personal investigation of UFOs.  I soon learned that it wasn't a meteor. Since the recent sighting, I thought I should report what I've seen.  It may coroborate someone else's sighting.  These separate sightings are not very important by themselves. There were no witnesses to any of these sightings.;32.3101019138756;-95.2988856459329
Westbound Spherical Object Near Tyler Texas;2008-11-18 06:30:00;30 minutes;Westbound Spherical Object Near Tyler Texas We were traveling eastbound on Texas Highway 64 from Canton to Tyler. Passing through Ben Wheeler (26 miles West of Tyler), we observed a sphere shaped object at approximately 5,000 to 7,000 feet traveling westbound. This object appeared to be 1.5 miles South of the Highway, traveling parallel to it and was solid gray in color. At no time were we able to see through it. For 25 minutes, we had a visual on the object, with the only lapses being caused by us driving through wooded areas which would block our view for a few seconds. After 25 minutes, the object appeared to change to a more elongated form, with the aft section beginning to droop. At this time, we started noticing more detail. We would estimate the length to be 300-400 yards in total. At the top portion, there appeared to be an object protruding out. The protrusion was black and gave the general appearance of a small fixed wing aircraft in a gentle climb. The middle of was still gray, and the drooping section appeared silver in color. At this point, we lost visual and sped up to try to get through the tree lined area. We pulled into a Wal-Mart parking lot, and began to scan the skyline. We had lost visual for 3-5 minutes while clearing the trees and pulling into the parking lot. We never regained visual.;32.3101019138756;-95.2988856459329
Four yellow-gold orbs flying from southeast to northwest viewed from Tyler, Texas just after midnight on 1/1/09.;2009-01-01 00:10:00;5 minutes;Four yellow-gold orbs flying from southeast to northwest viewed from Tyler, Texas just after midnight on 1/1/09. January 1, 2009 just after midnight local time (CST) in Tyler, Texas we saw at first two glowing yellow-gold orbs flying from the southeast in a northwest direction (more toward the west).  Their altitude was just above the tree tops and they were flying in perfect formation staying the same distance from each other through the whole sighting.  The sky was clear (no clouds) and there was little to no wind blowing. At first we thought that it could be that they were coming from a Roman candle since there were some fireworks being set off at the time (it being just after midnight at the New Year), but these objects were flying too perfectly and stayed at the same altitude the whole time. The light from these objects stayed at the same intensity throughout until they finally faded away at the horizon, and there was no sound. Just as the first two objects disappeared another two appeared from the southeast (the same direction as the first two).  These two orbs were identical in size and shape to the first two.  They were flying a little farther apart from each other than the first two (it seemed about twice as far), and the first one of this second two objects to appear was flying at a little higher altitude than the following object.  Again these two orbs flew at the same speed as the first two and stayed at the same distance from each other and at the same altitude throughout the sighting.  Also the intensity of the light from these objects was the same as the first two and similarly did not vary until they just faded away as they reached the horizon. The entire time of the sighting from the beginning two objects to the time the last two disappeared lasted a little more than five minutes. We were so much in awe and did not want to miss anything, so unfortunately we did not get any video of this.  It is only in our memories.  If anyone else witnessed this please report it.  Thank you for having this web site.;32.3101019138756;-95.2988856459329
