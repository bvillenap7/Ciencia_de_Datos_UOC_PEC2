East Texas July 2014 sighting one into two;2014-07-12 21:15:00;1 minute;East Texas, July 2014, sighting One into Two Driving home from Winnsboro to Quitman  at 9:15pm on Saturday  July 12th,  I noticed a different kind of light in the Eastern sky.  The light resembled these new type of car headlights (HiD or Led) lights.  It hovered for a few seconds and moved West in extremely fast speed not  capable by anything  humans have.  When it was passing in front of me, it split into 2  of these.  As I watched fly by, it suddenly disappeared.   With Facebook, I passed along what I saw on the way home.   I had 20+ people comment on it  people from Austin which is 250 miles Southwest of here and others from Louisiana which is 250+ miles East of here.   There is video footage of this sighting being circulated.;32.7996;-95.434
