Unexplained noise that DID NOT come from a person or an animal!!!;2008-03-28 03:30:00;2 hrs.;Unexplained noise that DID NOT come from a person or an animal!!! I was sleeping with my windows open when I was awaken by a very strange noise that is so hard to describe. The noise was like someone or something wearing metal shoes walking on my concrete driveway and porch.  At the same time, the talking was like a bubbling sound that would change in frequency and pitch.  At times, it would sound excited and talk faster.  This was always with the metal-on-contret noise.  It would go away and then come back. At one point, I went outside and sat in a porch swing in the dark.  There is a mobile home park across the street from me and one home had some lights on.  I saw a dark, low-flying form pass the lighted windows at a fast rate.  Then I heard the sounds from inside the mobile home park and dogs started barking.  At this point, I thought, What am I doing outside?  I went back inside.  I kept hearing the noise off and on until dawn started to break.  Very creepy and very hard to describe.;28.0572;-97.0334
