Recalled ufo sighting.;1982-06-15 19:00:00;5 sec;Recalled ufo sighting. The object was saucer shaped and it was grey. It almost seemed as though you could put your hands straight through it. It was hovering behind some trees. 3 sisters saw them ages 14, 16, and 18. At first they misstook it for the air vent of the roof of the local high school, when they relized that the school was in the opposite derection. When they turned back to see the object it had turned into a light and it streaked across the sky from north to southwest. The stranger part of this was that none of the witnesses recalled this event untill 12 years later. Currently the three sisters hold respectibale jobs and only one is a fanatic of ufology. One works in the sheriffs department another is a teacher in a grade school and the other is earning her engieering degree. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides a minimum of contact information.  We will invite her to have the other two witnesses submit reports, as well.  PD));31.5473;-106.2521
