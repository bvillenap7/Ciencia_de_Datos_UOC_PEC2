Glowing Light Seen Over Leakey Texas;2009-12-16 06:30:00;10 Minutes;Glowing Light Seen Over Leakey Texas I was sitting in a deer blind waiting for the sun to come up and noticed a bright star towards the west.  I didn't think anything of it at first but upon a closer look, I noticed it was moving downward in rapid spurts so decided to take a look with my binoculars.   When I looked with my binoculars I could tell the object was no star and no aircraft.  It was a glowing light that changed colors and moved in spurts and when it moved it moved rapidly and not a slow gradual decline.  Eventually it moved past the hills on the horizon and I lost sight of it.   I have no idea what this object was.  They best way I could describe the object was it looked like a oval/diamond shaped object with smooth edges that glowed light a light bulb.  It resembled those orbs that people have described seeing in Arizona and didn't have any real form.  It made no sound whatsoever and it was light a light bulb that changed from very subtle colors of green, red and white.;29.769;-99.7479
