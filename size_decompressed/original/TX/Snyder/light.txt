This was a large property, but no ranch house.  We hunted from the afternoon until about midnight (legal in Texas). There was a series of 2 or 3 gates we had to go through, I was driving and a friend was getting the gates.  At the last gate he asked me to come look at something.  It was a light way up in the sky.  Not extremely bright, but brighter than the stars that were out. The light didn’t seem to be moving, so I grabbed binoculars and we both looked at it.  It looked like a huge panel of stadium lights.  A perfectly laid out pattern of 18-24 lights.  It was hard to make out because it was at a very high altitude.  There were no other lights around besides my headlights.  We might not have noticed it in town. We watched the lights for 10-15 minutes, they didn’t move or change color or intensity.  We decided to leave, and just then the lights just went off.  We never saw any kind of aircraft or anything that could explain the lights.  The only thing I could think of was a satellite, but it was far too low an altitude for a satellite   I’m an Air Force Veteran and have worked around aircraft all my adult life.  I have no explanation of what this could have been, based on my knowledge of military and civilian aircraft.  I’ve thought about this sighting often, never found anyone else who has seen anything like it.  I remember that date, and I’ve discussed it a few times with the friend who I was with.;32.7429476190476;-100.922714285714
