Round disk with lights;1991-10-15 03:00:00;5 minutes;Round disk with lights Was working night shift at Fuller Gas Plant in 1991, saw round object could see lights yellow green, maybe blue, going around, didn't really see the color of the object itself, just the lights. It hovered/moved very slowly over gas plant, but the distance it covered it must have been faster than I thought. I didn't hear any sounds, and nothing out of the ordinary happened at the gas plant. I watched it for about 5 minutes before it dissapeared suddenly, As it was moving, I called another co-worker at the water station, but he didn't notice it. It was travelling from west- northwest to south south-east direction. It dissapeared just when it passed over my head. It was a dark night, no clouds.

A large disc hovering about ~30 ft from the ground;2013-04-27 02:30:00;5-7 minutes;A large disc hovering about ~30 ft from the ground A large disc with 8 lights (4 rows of 2 lights) was hovering in a field behind our home absolutely motionless as if it were hovering.  As we drove up to our home, it must have noticed our vehicles headlights  (as they were pointing in the direction of the craft when we drive up) because it started to move in our direction very  slowly as if it were scanning. I ran out of my vehicle to get a closer look and i immediately noticed a row of windows in between the lights.  The craft was a smooth dark metal and very very large in size. It was low to the ground and there was absolutely no noise to it. My husband went to take a picture as it slowly came towards us on the west side.  As soon as our phone camera flashed, the craft seemed to disappear within a flash.  We didn't even see the direction it went. It was like it just disappeared.  All we heard was a weird mechanical sound and a fast turbo speed like an airplane going really really fast.  This craft seemed to be a! bout 30-40 feet from the ground and was absolutely huge in size.  It is important to note that my husband and I love to look at the stars at night and previously spotted flashing lights (white and red) in the sky.  We were never really sure what they were jus knew the sound associated with the craft and that they moved very fast.  We bought binoculars to further investigate but on this particular night the craft was really low to the ground and when we took the binoculars from the car the craft was too close to get within lens.;32.7429476190476;-100.922714285714
