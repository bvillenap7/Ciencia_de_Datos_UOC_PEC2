Rectangular object flying low, slow with red light flashing.;2011-05-28 04:30:00;5 min;Rectangular object flying low, slow with red light flashing. I was driving east on 84 about 30 miles west of Snyder, I turned to my left and saw just above the road a rectangular object with a red light flashing under it.  It was flying low and traveling west.   I never noticed the object as it was approaching me and only saw it when it was above and to the left of me.  I tried to watch it while driving at the same time.  I was startled and wanted to turn around to follow it but was too scared.  I instead pulled to the side of the road to watch it.   The low speed, bright flashing light, and object flying low never changed.   I continued to watch it until it left my sight.;32.7429476190476;-100.922714285714
