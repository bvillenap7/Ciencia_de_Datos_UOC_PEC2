Very symmetrical and evenly spaced. On Friday, Oct 5th, around 11:55pm., my husband and I witnessed 4 rectangle objects flying in a row like this: ////   It was ~45 degrees above the eastern horizon and was the rectangles were lit up in a white shimmering/waving/pulsing light.  They were very symmetrically shaped and evenly spaced.  We saw them for about 5 seconds and then the lights disappeared instantly.  There was no noise.  We live in a smaller community north of Dallas and there is not a lot of light pollution in our area. I at first thought it was birds flying but there were no lights that could have been reflecting upwards on them and my husband pointed out they were too symmetrical, spaced too perfectly, and too bright.  Also the way they disappeared instantly and they kept their rectangle shaped.  I will say that it kind of freaked us both out for we have never seen anything like it before and we have spent more hours than we can count sitting outside on the driveway, under the stars, enjoying the outdoors.  Also that same night we saw at least 6 falling stars and we have never seen that many in one night, even when we have sat out to watch meteor showers.  We did sit out last night, Weds. Oct 10th, and yet again saw another UFO, but this time it was larger and boomerang shaped.  I will post it on a separate report.  I donâ€™t think I want to sit out again for quite a while for it is really freaking me out.;33.4311;-96.5511999999999
