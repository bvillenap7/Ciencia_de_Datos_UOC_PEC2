Close encounter in Texas, missing time.;1996-05-12 21:00:00;3 hour period;Close encounter in Texas, missing time. We were staying at a friends in the country outside Van Alstyne, Texas and we were sitting outside looking at the woods out back. We were 60 miles North of Dallas The woods flashed 2 or 3 times like a strobe light or camera flash. The entire area did this and we were amazed not knowing what happened..there is no one around this area in the country.. we went inside and then went out front only to see coming from the side of this place [house] a disc go sailing by in what appeared to be leaving the woods or taking off from the woods behind us SHOOTING OFF across the sky going east getting higher as it flew..Not a sound from this thing. at first thought it was a plane or jet but not so because there was no sound?? It was about 200 feet away from the northside of the house too close to not be heard....Brilliant lights! When our friends came out we were aware of some missing time? 2 days. Very confusing for us. there was more to this story but we kinda put it aside. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.4311;-96.5511999999999
White glowing saucer like UFO moving in and out of wall cloud over Van Alstyne TX;2019-09-26 08:15:00;5 minutes;White glowing saucer like UFO moving in and out of wall cloud over Van Alstyne TX I was traveling down highway 75 in Van Alstyne, TX, during the beginning of a small thunderstorm. I noticed a white LED fairly bright light saucer style shape moving in vertical and horizontal, hovering type movements through a dark wall cloud.  It proceeded to move through and in and out of the clouds before disappearing.  It was a solid non-blinking light. It appeared to be larger than a plane.  It was not a weather balloon or a phone tower.  It was not a drone, too large to be, and as it moved it stayed in a very small area where it would hover and move.  Ok have never witnessed anything like that.;33.4311;-96.5511999999999
