Last night my husband and I sat out on our driveway again and around 10:00pm. we witnessed a large, almost transparent, boomerang object.  It was ~75 degrees above the eastern horizon.  It was close to the same path of the UFO we saw Friday, Oct 5th, but it had a totally different shape.  It almost looked pixelized<sp?>, like a large mass of tiny lights all clustered together in the shape of a large boomerang.  We saw it for about 4 seconds and it disappeared.  The place where we started to see it, to where it disappeared was almost exactly the same place where we saw the one last Friday, but it was higher off the horizon.  I do not think I will be sitting out on the driveway again for a LONG time!!;33.4311;-96.5511999999999
