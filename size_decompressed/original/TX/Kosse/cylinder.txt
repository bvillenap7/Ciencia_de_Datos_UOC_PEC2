At first just thought it was a cloud until it began to puff out some kind of 'mist' to disguise itself...but it was still visible from behind the cloud.  Attempted to take photo with a digital camera that only zooms so far but i did keep the photo's because you can tell theree is something there, behind the cloud. I rushed home to try to get my father in law to see it but the angle was different and the event was down behind tree's at his property.  Only i saw it...BUT i know what I saw.;31.3136;-96.6237
