We were taking a walk down a small cow trail when we saw a bright flash of light. WE stopped and watched the sky thinking it may have been lightning but we saw no other flashes. Then all of a sudden, a brightly bluish/violet bottle shaped craft came descending from the sky. It came down some and stopped where it hovered about 100 ft above the ground. It hovered there for a while and then it started to circle around us various times. Then after circling us it just took off and there was another burst of light. The observers are a lawyer who has had nine years of practice and his wife who is a hygenist at a dentist's office. Neither has had any background of psychological disorder.;32.9616;-96.6019
