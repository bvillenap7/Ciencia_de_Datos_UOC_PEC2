GIANT ORB AT AFTERNOON TIME...NO MISTAKE IN IDENTY;2010-03-25 15:00:00;45 seconds;GIANT ORB AT AFTERNOON TIME...NO MISTAKE IN IDENTY At 3:30 pm 4 yrs ago I saw the largest sphere/orb during the day.  I have a story for you.  It was so huge and headed west to east about 20 minutes before we hit the Oklahoma border.  We were coming home from Nebraska off on vacation.  It was real windy that day and we had two layers of clouds one close and the other was where this was traveling.   Looked like the moon shape and whiter than the whitest cloud around.  It was so big you could fill it with the size of our jets at the chem trail distance.  It was moving like it was darting in and out of the clouds not to be seen but within 45 sec I caught it a few times by itself.  In the middle of the day sun was to the west clouds coming from south to north and it was moving west to east.  During the day ???  I know what I saw.  The depth was not seen just a straight on shot.  I could describe this better on the phone;32.9616;-96.6019
