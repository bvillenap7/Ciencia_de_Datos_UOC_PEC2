My daughter and I witness a bright light that was seeing toward the north in Sachse Texas.  The light was very bright and did not flash or have any kind of movement to it (like an airplane or helicopter or even a star I guess). The night was very clear and you could see all the stars out and airplanes passing by.  This light caught our attention because it was so bright and it did not have any of the light characteristics of the other stars that were out.   It did not have any flashing lights like an airplane and it wasn't moving across the sky so it wasn't a commercial or private airplane (imo).  The light wasn't even that high up in the atmosphere like the other airplanes were when I saw a couple that night. What happened next is what really caused our jaws to drop.  The light came speeding down toward earth like it was going to crash (I really expected a loud crash sound) but then it swooped up and it disappeared!!  It didn't come down at an angle or slowly descend....it moved with force straight down....STRAIGHT DOWN then immediately (without hesitation) it did a U turn toward the sky and it disappeared.  It had no trail or it didn't have any other colors to it but just a white solid color.;32.9616;-96.6019
26 star like objects separated by 20 degrees passing eact north east.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-16 21:30:00;30 minutes;26 star like objects separated by 20 degrees passing eact north east Observed on the night of April 16, 2020, at approximately 9:25 pm to 9:40 pm central time: 26 star like objects passed over head. The objects could be seen two at a time.  Spacing was approx. 10 degrees or 20 seconds to 30 seconds apart moving in a East North East direction.  Brightness of the objects were equal to dimmest star in the sky.  Venus was visible at about 40 degrees above the western horizon. The objects became visible near Venus and remained so for approx. 20 degrees.  Object numbers 16 & 17 became very bright (white) then dimmed, all in a matter of one to two seconds. The brightness increased to the equivalent of the brightest star in the sky.  Later, checking for similar reporting on Nuforc, I found that Star-link satellites could be what I saw. Even though this may be the answer, I do wonder why two of the objects increased in brightness.;32.9616;-96.6019
