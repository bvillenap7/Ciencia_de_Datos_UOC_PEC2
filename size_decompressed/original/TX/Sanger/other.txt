U shaped orange glowing object.;2015-01-14 22:40:00;4 minutes;&quotU&quot Shaped Orange Glowing Object My girlfriend and I were driving southbound on I-35, about two miles north of Sanger, Texas, when, at approximately 10:40 pm, she remarked of a strange bright object to the west of us.  It was a very large, “U” shaped object, orange/rust in color, glowing brightly, approximately 25 degrees above the horizon.  It looked fairly similar to a crescent moon, however, it was lit from the bottom, to create a “U” shaped appearance.   This captured our attention very intensely, because firstly, it is impossible for the moon to be lit from the bottom, and secondly, the moon would not be 25 degrees above the western horizon at 10:40 at night.  We confirmed that the moon’s illuminated side was not even facing Earth on this particular night, according to www.moongiant.com. We continued driving southbound for roughly 4 minutes, observing the object in astonishment, and asking each other what the heck it could possibly be.  It appeared to be both very large and somewhat distant from our location.   Wanting to get a better look at the object and observe it more, we exited on exit 481, and headed west bound on View Road toward where we had last seen it.  An overpass obstructed our line of sight to the object momentarily before we could turn on to View Rd. and once we turned west the object was no longer visible. We continued down View Rd. until it intersected with Lois Rd.  Headed south on Lois until we could head west on 455, but were unable to locate it again. The size and shape of the object was incredible.   It was a very strange and memorable experience.;33.3561;-97.1803
