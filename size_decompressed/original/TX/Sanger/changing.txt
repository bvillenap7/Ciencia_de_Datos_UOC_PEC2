The sky was cloudy and pretty dark, but a few minutes later, we looked over the Ray Roberts dam and saw a giant object in the sky.  The object in question had a fiery hue and changed form a few times.  It would get bigger and brighter and then it would shrink down to nothing and reappear. It rotated around while it was in view and had around 3 other objects of the same fiery hue fly up to it.  After the 3 smaller objects flew up towards it, it vanished.   While we were observing it we attempted to capture images of it.  I was unsuccessful as my images were blurry but my 2 other friends managed to capture photo and video of it.;33.3561;-97.1803
