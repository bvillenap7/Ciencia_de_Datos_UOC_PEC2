I was driving on highway 287 at 11:45pm and saw a bright pink light in the sky  far to the north.  It zoomed closer and stopped.  Several cars on both sides of the highway stopped and watched this light.   It sat there for a couple of minutes and then flew to the south.  It stopped for a couple of seconds and then rapidly flew away. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
