It looked like a string of white lights evenly spaced apart.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-28 21:58:00;4 minutes;Last night I stepped out on porch looked up North West direction and it looked like a string of white lights evenly spaced apart from my view began about the height of the telephone pole upward in a linear arched manner. The lights were moving in a line toward the half moon sitting due west of my home, then one by one disappeared into the darkness.  The skies were mostly clear few wispy clouds from few miles east of my home to the west.  However, east of this area was thunder storm lightning event that was moving south east. I’ve never seen anything like this before and was wondering if they were launching satellites or something.  Wish I’d had my phone out there with me.  I’m an educated person in the health field we live outside city limits slightly where ther a no city lights interfering with star gazing. I’m certain I’m not the only person to have observed these lights it was extraordinary it caught my eye.  I’ve never seen or reported anything like this before.  You may contact me if needed/confirm if others saw these lights too.;33.9441;-98.6798
