As I was out checking my livestock I looked to the NW and saw a line of what appeared to be stars moving to the SE. I immediately called upon one of my friends to look out and make sure I wasnâ€™t crazy. By the time From the point I began counting there were 19 total. As they reached just beyond the vanish point of the moon they disappeared. By the time my friend saw what I was looking at there were only four remaining and the same result. Just vanished. We assumed satellites but never have I seen a formation as such.  I tried to take a photo with my phone but all that appeared was the moon.;33.9441;-98.6798
