Object appeared to be spinning in a counter clockwise fashion. What was interesting, was that when I observed the object I thought it was a plane moving for a landing in DFW however,  as the objected was decending it stoped and reversed itself then shot off in a opposit diagnal angle. I was apprehensive about telling anyone but I thought maybe this might be of use to you for record keeping purposes. From where I was realtive to where I observed the obeject I suspect it must have been at least as large as a 747. I'm sure I was not the only one observing the object given the size.

Neon white cylinder moving slowly to the north over Lewisville TX;2004-07-03 08:45:00;10 minutes;Neon white cylinder moving slowly to the north over Lewisville TX I observed for about 10 minutes a single cylinder moving at a moderately slow speed from south to north. I live in an area north of DFW airport and I'm used to seeing various aircraft, and I haven't seen anything like this before.  Size was approx 3/16 when measured at arms length color was like a solid glowing neon white tube which did not vary as it moved across the sky, that is, there were no wings casting any shadow or reflections.  I watched the object move steadily north until it disappeared into the middle of some low dark storm clouds that were moving in from the north.;33.0452401630993;-97.0042067278276
