I wish I had written down the date that I saw this because after reading reports of the same type object's on your website, I feel I actually saw something unusual.  My best guess is mid Jan. 2003.  I leave for work at 5:10am every workday and was traveling east down Valley Ridge Blvd.  Just a few blocks before reaching I-35,in the southeast,I saw 2 brilliant green orbs with a green teardrop trailing each one heading straight down.  They were not together.... one was lagging behind and to the right(west) of the other one and was slightly smaller. They didnt fizzle out,,, they stayed the same intensity until going below my line of sight. At first I thought, Wow!!! That was 2 of the strangest meteors I've ever seen!  But then as I drove on I got to thinking of the few meteors I've seen in the past and they were always pinpoints of light with a skinny trail mostly bluish white in color.  I've seen some green meteors but they were pinpoints of light with a skinny green trail but these were large... almost like what I'd call gas balls.  I finally convinced myself that it was probably the reflection of the green traffic lights at the intersection that I had just passed because that was the exact color of the objects, but I've gone through that same intersection every workday at near the same time and no reflection looks like what I saw. When I arrived at work I asked if anyone else had seen the green lights but nobody had. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.0452401630993;-97.0042067278276
