My friends and I saw up to 40 lights in the North Texas sky.;2004-11-27 18:30:00;1 hour;My friends and I saw up to 40 lights in the North Texas sky. On 11/27/2004 around 16:30 I was arriving home from Christmast shopping with friends.  I live on the third floor of an apartment building in Lewisville Texas (North Dallas).  When I reached the top of the stairs something caught my eye in the sky.  I turned and saw about 8-10 objects in the Northern horizon moving up and to the east.  Just to the Northwest of these lights was a low hanging strange like smoke that moved in the same direction of the lights.  I watched lights for about 30 seconds, thinking they where balloons.  Then I went into my house.  Immediately upon entering my house I received a telephone call from a friend of mine that lives on the second floor of my building, come outside on the patio immediately.  By this time, her son was on the patio as well as my neighbor that lives directly below me.  We began to watch these 10-12 of these objects in the sky.  My friends looked at them with binoculars and we quickly decided that they where not balloons but some type of light.  They seemed to launch from somewhere on the horizon and move up and to the right.  We watched this set of lights until they we could no longer see them anymore.  This went on for about an hour.  I would say we saw a total of 4 sets of these lights.  We where so amazed with the lights and the strange looking fog on the horizon that we failed to take any pictures.  Living near DFW airport we are use to seeing lots of airplanes.  We did not see airplanes last night, we even joked because we saw airplanes flying in different points in the sky.  At one point 2 of the lights almost played with each other by jerking back and forth, like they where playing tug of war. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be exceptionally credible.  Please see other report from Texas for the same date.  PD));33.0452401630993;-97.0042067278276
Bright light moving silently, west to east;2005-12-30 18:15:00;1 to 1.5 min.;Bright light moving silently, west to east My wife and I were in our front yard checking out Mars, Venus and some stars, using our Canon 10x30 I.S. binoculars. As I scanned the sky slightly west of the zenith, I noticed this steady bright light moving silently at a rapid even pace toward the ENE.  With the binoculars, it was a sphere, evenly and brightly illuminated, sharp and clear with no running or navigational lights. It was slightly smaller than Venus and only a magnitude dimmer, and appeared to be self-illuminated. I watched it until it began to dim steadily from a white light to a faint reddish color, then nothing. It took about four or five seconds to go from bright to being blacked out. The dimming seemed to encompass the object evenly.  Altitude, speed and size of the object...difficult to judge. Physical dimension was 1/32 inch viewing the scale from 12 inches. My guess is the object was at 30k ft. or better, est speed 600 to 800 mph., possibly faster.  My background: I'm a 10 year veteran of the Air Force in Communications Maintenance and I am employed as Machine Maint. Foreman for a large area newspaper.;33.0452401630993;-97.0042067278276

UFO with bright white tail almost crashed on highway but vanished just before impact.;2014-01-24 18:55:00;~10 seconds;UFO with bright white tail almost crashed on highway but vanished just before impact. This happened on Friday Jan 24th, 2014, just before 7:00 pm CST while driving northbound on 35 just north of business 121.  Out of nowhere, bright white streak of light fell from the sky.  It was a perfect white line of burning white light heading straight towards the ground.  It left no smoke trail, there was no burst or noise before, during or after it appeared, and no real noticeable head on the streak of light.  As it  got closer, I could see that it had a yellow round section on each side of the bright white line at the lead.  It was no shooting star nor like any meteor I've ever seen and it seemed so close.  Everyone on the highway immediately started breaking, as though we were all instinctively reacting and preparing for it to crash land on the highway & cause a massive pile up.  Then, just when it seemed to be only about 50ft overhead and moving FAST towards us all, it vanished without a trace.  As quickly as it appeared, it was gone.  It started & ended in 7 seconds, tops.;33.0452401630993;-97.0042067278276

Revolving, Teeter-tottering, Floating Trash Bag Light, Above Lewisville, TX;2020-07-24 10:30:00;6 minutes;Revolving, Teeter-tottering, Floating Trash Bag Light, Above Lewisville, TX In north Dallas, at the border of Lewisville, the Colony, and Frisco, on July, 24th of 2020, around 10:30 AM, I was sitting out on my apartment patio, when I caught a glimpse of a solid, luminating, white object in the crystal-clear blue sky.  At first thinking it was a drifting plastic Walmart bag, I thought nothing of it. But then I noticed it was too far away for me to think that it was a garbage bag.  It wasn’t big by any means but around the length of 3-5 miles in the air, I wouldn’t be able to see a plastic Walmart bag so clearly.  I then pulled out my iPhone and began to record.  I ended up getting 10 good seconds of it. 	It was moving from the North to the South (Right to left according to my view), appearing to look like a plastic bag would drifting mid-air. But after I viewed my recording zoomed all the way in, it appeared to be possibly circulating(spinning), and sides dipping up and down similar to a teetertotter. It escaped my sight of my patio as it passed below the roof of the adjacent apartment in front of me. 	Out of curiosity, I quickly ran down and out to the parking lot beneath me to see if I could catch another glimpse of the flying object. I just wanted to see if it was a plastic bag or not. It took me precisely 1.5 minutes to get in position where I should have had a clear view.  The object wasn’t where it should have been had it continued its speed and course. I looked for a matter of maybe 20 seconds and then spotted it again. I am from North Dakota. I have visited sights and many national parks where I have been shown what 10-20 miles away looks like to the naked eye. According to my eye, this object turned west and was about 15+ miles away from where I had seen it on my patio. What I’d compare it to was looking at a star in a night’s sky except it was day light at 10:30 in the morning. 	Now we live in an area close to the DFW airport. Hundreds if not thousands of planes fly over our area per day. A plane is really the easiest thing to notice. However, it is something that is really hard to mistake. When you see a plane, you see a plane. It moves at the same pace, it most of the time is going in the same direction. At one point it can be close. After a few moments it will pass and be gone as you watch it get further and further away. This was nothing like that. It was not a plane. I have video to prove that. This was something else. 	As I watched it in the west, it was moving right to the left at a very slow pace not getting any further away than it already was. A light seemed to be going in and out on it like a glimmer in the sun. Not like the light blinking on the air plane. It wasn’t moving at a consistent pace. It would move left, then stop, then movie left, then stop. 	As I was watching, I was recording with my iPhone. It was hard to keep a clear and still image due to the distance between me and the object. I couldn’t’ even see it on my phone. It was bright out and I was squinting. I just aimed my phone at the area and hoped that I could see it later on my phone. I was able to but it is blurry and not still unfortunately. You are able to follow it though on my phone.  It was coming up on a cloud and I didn’t want to miss the last part. I put my phone down and then what I saw next was uncertain. I was squinting and it was bright. I could have seen a lot but the sun was behind me. When I say that, I mean that it wasn’t obstructing my vision. It just created a bright atmosphere to my eyes were having a more difficult time staying wide open. I may or may not have seen this object, do a full loop up and down then disappear NE in the matter of a second. After questioning what I had seen, I looked for the object which wasn’t quite to the cloud ! yet and it was nowhere to be seen. Almost no time after, one of the hundreds of planes that fly over us flew right into the area that the object had been. This took place over the time span of maybe 4-6 minutes, start to finish. 	The weather this day was partly cloudy, mostly blue skies. The wind was little to non. There wasn’t the sound of a plane flying by. There were no plumes. It was just a white odd shaped ball you could see spinning and dipping. An interesting way to end the week.;33.0452401630993;-97.0042067278276
