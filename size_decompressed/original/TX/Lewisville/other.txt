multi color changing lightning bolt. contained in a flair like star;2006-05-20 04:30:00;1.5hrs;multi color changing lightning bolt. contained in a flair like star I got up early saturday morning.. looked to the west sky about 25 degrees up from horizon.  I saw a twinkling red yellow blue green rotating color object.  with a reflector 9mm with 2x barlow.  looked like a flaired out star but it kept changing colors.  almost looked as if little bolts of colored light arcing like if you held a sparkplug next to metal and started it.. the bolt or arc was contained in the flair(like a star out of focus and it flairs) i watched it and got my wife to look at it too.  as the sun came up it was the same bright ness seemed to be moving farther away ..  only thing i can think of .. the golf tournament in fort worth and the new goodyear blimp is in town.  and the colored lights are the changing elctronic sign.  but i have no way of confirming this.;33.0452401630993;-97.0042067278276
