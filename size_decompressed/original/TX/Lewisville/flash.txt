I was out talking to my neighbor last nite after a walk.. We saw this BRIGHT flash and looked up.. towards where the moon was we saw this flash of light moving towards the right then slowly fade.. there was no sound... we both didnt know what it was.. it was a pretty good size.. and was very bright.. it was too big to be a falling star.. i was hoping someone else had seen it and knew what it was... we were both glad that we had BOTH seen that... we knew no one else would believe us. But the odd thing is that it was a BIG flash that took place first.... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
