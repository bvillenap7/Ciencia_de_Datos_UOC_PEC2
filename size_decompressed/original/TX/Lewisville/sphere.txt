I glanced up at them and observed MUCH higher in the cloudless blue sky a jet plane (we are in the Dallas area so there are LOTS of planes). Hundreds of yards behind it a dark orange sphere was following it. At first I thought maybe it was one of those advertising signs that planes drag but then I realized there was no apparent wire and of course, why just a ball and no words? I pointed it out to my husband and just as I was trying to get him to see where it was it just disappeared into thin air. The plane continued on its way. Maybe what I saw was a child's balloon and it just popped right after I saw it but then why was the motion in perfect rhythm with the plane?;33.0452401630993;-97.0042067278276
Moving ball of light shooting upwards in cloud then disappeared in sphere of energy.;2015-10-30 05:27:00;10 seconds;Moving ball of light shooting upwards in cloud then disappeared in sphere of energy. Shooting star like appearance except moving upwards through clouds, slowed down and looked almost like a little ball of light then disappeared after producing a sphere of energy.  I cannot comprehend what I saw other than the fact it travel through a portal of some type. Sphere left some type of specks of lights when it closed.  Sounds sci-fi but it's exactly what I saw.;33.0452401630993;-97.0042067278276
