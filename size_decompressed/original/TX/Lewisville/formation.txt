Three flare red lights over the Lewisville, TX night sky.;2013-02-02 22:45:00;5 minutes;Three flare red lights over the Lewisville, TX night sky. Three flare red lights in the sky to the east of Lewisville, TX moving south or southeast one above the other in a straight line. It lasted from the point of coming from behind one building and disappearing behind another, around five minutes. These lights were not planes and had no flashing lights that seemed like any aircraft from America. The lights turned off and the objects were still there.;33.0452401630993;-97.0042067278276
Red/orange orbs in the sky.;2014-03-19 22:00:00;30 seconds;Red/orange orbs in the sky Driving on highway 121 with my son and happened to look up at the sky and saw 3 reddish orange orbs, unmoving in an L shape.  If there were more I didn't have time to see them. I pulled off the road immediately and by the time I got out all three were gone.  They were not planes, there were no small flashing lights, the shapes remained consistent and did not get smaller or larger.  The sky is clear tonight and you can see many stars, but these were three times bigger than the brightest star, and if there were planes they should have still been visible overhead or flying in the opposite direction when I got out of my car.  I looked up many videos online from across the world and were exactly what I saw tonight, and this is the first time I've ever seem anything like these.  I live near an airport and am very familiar with planes of all shapes and sizes, and what the lights look like.  Whatever these were, they were there plain as day and gone.  On my way back I also noted 3 helicopters flying in the direction I just came from.;33.0452401630993;-97.0042067278276
