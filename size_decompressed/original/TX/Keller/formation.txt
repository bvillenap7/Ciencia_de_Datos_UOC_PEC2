12 white dots in four groups of three flying in a coordinated path at high altitude.;2017-07-29 22:00:00;4 minutes;12 white dots in four groups of three flying in a coordinated path at high altitude. At 10:00 PM CST (July 29, 2017), my family and I witnessed a flight of 12 objects flying in a formation of 4 groups of 3 objects.  They were flying at a high altitude, and did not have any beacons, strobes, or red/green indicators.  The unknown items were so high, we might not have noticed them, because they looked liked stars at first, but my daughter jumped and said they were moving.  And wow, they were moving in a coordinated formation and direction (south-southwest).  As there were at least 12 objects, one would have thought there would be engine noise, but none was heard.   I would wonder if these items were observed on DFW Airport, Alliance Airport, or Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base's radar screens?;32.9278886792455;-97.2539207547161
