Three lights over Keller, Texas area.;2007-10-18 23:15:00;20 minutes;Three lights over Keller, Texas area. At around 11:15pm Friday November 18, 2007, Two of my siblings and I witnessed three lights in the sky southeast of us.  The three-lighted objects flickered from green to white to a pinkish color at an astonishing rate.  Two of the smaller objects seemed to make a circular path away from the central stationary light, one to the north and one to the south coming back to the original point from where they started and began the process over.  We watched this happen for about 20 minutes and then the two outer lights faded away and a minute or two later the one that was stationary and the brightest followed suit and faded away.  This is not the first time weâ€™ve witnessed something like this over the north Texas skies.  There has been at least four other occasions and all of the sightings have been at around the same time of night.;32.9278886792455;-97.2539207547161
