At first 2 bright lights were observed side by side in the east sky, a third appeared next to the first 2, they were in a straight line side by side, a fourth appeared, only it gave the impression that it was dropped down from the other 3 in a row. At times it gave the effect of a light reflecting on the clouds around it. Each 3 of the lights blinked off and on very slowly though not in any sequence. The sky was so cloudy that stars and airplane lights were not visible. The lights were caught on video tape, when my son tried to zoom in on the lights, they looked like arched windows of white light that faded. After approximately 3-5 minutes they went out one by one till they were gone. The lights never moved in any direction and there was no sound of aircraft.;32.9278886792455;-97.2539207547161
