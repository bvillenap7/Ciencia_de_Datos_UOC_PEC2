While sitting in bed (I am sick with a sinus infection) I looked out the window and noticed what appeared to be a high altitude disk shaped craft moving from the North to South towards the West. The craft was below cloud level. (Clouds base = 40k+ high altitude) Motion reminded me of the time I watched the space station fly overhead. Yet this craft stopped for seconds at a time then resumed travel in the same North- South direction. Sighting lasted about 7 minutes.;32.9278886792455;-97.2539207547161
