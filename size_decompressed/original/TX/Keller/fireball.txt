Goldent Knights make night time dive into Keller, TX homecoming game;2007-10-19 19:20:00;5 minutes;Goldent Knights make night time dive into Keller, TX homecoming game The multiple sightings over Keller, TX on the evening of 10/19/07 were of the Army Golden Knights skydiving team doing a night drop into the stadium for the Keller High School homecoming game, before the game.  They all had sparklers attached to their feet to be visible at they fell and were spectacularly visible. As I recall there were two drops a few minutes apart, with as maybe 12 individual skydivers.  During at least on of the drops, they fell together initially and then scattered in sort of an inverted lily pattern. The Golden Knights were at the air show at nearby Alliance airport (Ft. Worth, TX) later that weekend. There were probably 3 or 4 thousand witnesses to this at the game and this event could easily be verified by the Keller Independent School District.;32.9278886792455;-97.2539207547161
Falling object in the Western sky;2007-10-19 19:34:00;7 seconds;At approximately 7:34 PM on 10/19/2007 my husband and I observed a falling object in the Western sky.  We watched it for approximately 15 seconds as it moved from above us toward the west.  It was a ball of fire and left a long trail of sparks.   It fell at a south westerly angle from roughly 110 degrees high to unvisibilitly behind the trees on our horizon with a constant spark trail.   Our position is 32.9582 Degrees North - 97.1857 Degrees West in Tarrant County Texas.;32.9278886792455;-97.2539207547161
fiery slow moving streak across sky splits into 4 slow streaks then stops and hovers.;2007-10-19 20:00:00;2 minutes;fiery slow moving streak across sky splits into 4 slow streaks then stops and hovers. From Keller, TX in the northern sky a meteor like streak across the sky at a slow pace.   A fiery tale trailing the object high up in the sky.   I have seen meteors before and this was no meteor.  Meteors last a very short second, but this was a slow streak across the sky which then split into about 4 seperate streaks in perfect formation.  Then the fiery streaks stopped dead in their tracks and started floating, seeming to hover.   The lights were much brighter than that of other airplanes seen flying into the Dallas Fort Worth airport.  Then one of the lights went out then reappeared again.  Then all lights disappeared.   There was a circling aircraft in the sky in the same vicinity.;32.9278886792455;-97.2539207547161
