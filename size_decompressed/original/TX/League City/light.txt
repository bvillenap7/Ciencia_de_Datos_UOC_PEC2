bright  light hovering  in south east sky just south of houston tx;2011-01-01 05:15:00;30min;bright  light hovering  in south east sky just south of houston tx I was driving home from north side of Houston,TX back towards my home in league city,TX at about 5am when I saw a bright light pretty far in the distance. I watched the light while I was driving on the freeway thinking it was a planes headlights, but by the time I pulled into my driveway 25 minutes later it was still there almost as though it was just hovering high enough where you could see it from anywhere. I got out of my car and lined a tree up in front of the light to judge if the light was moving or still. I stood there for an addition 10 min. and realized it was staying in basically the same spot not getting closer or farther nor did the light fade. I finally went inside and I have not been able explain what it was. unless there was a star that was very bright on this particular night. It was just a bright light towards the south east that seemed to be to close and to bright for a star but couldn't have been an airplane because the position stayed the! same.

Orange lights and dark objects over League City, Texas.;2013-12-28 19:45:00;5 minutes;Orange lights and dark objects over League City, Texas. My family was driving home from dinner. My wife noticed a couple of orange light objects in the sky.  I slowed down and the pulled the car over and we all watched.  Two or three orange lights moved across the sky in a manner faster than an aircraft would but not too fast.  The lights moved toward each other and then one passed the other one.  They then seemed to stay in about the same relative location, what appeared flame like came out of both of them, they both moved directly upward until they could no longer be seen.  During this same time a couple of much larger, dark geometric shaped objects moved across the sky much lower.  They appeared to have mass and thickness.  These objects had no lights on them only appeared visible by the night sky.  The dark objects moved in the same direction as the lights from the southeast to the northwest.  The dark objects moved at a steady speed across the sky.;29.5183;-95.0977000000002
