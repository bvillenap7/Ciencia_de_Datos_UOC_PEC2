Green UFO over Galveston County 8-27-08.  ((NUFORC Note:  Optical aberration.  PD));2008-08-27 15:00:00;captured in single photo ;Green UFO over Galveston County 8-27-08 An hour or 2 earlier there were storms bulding around Galveston County i was taking pictures with my New Digital Camera after the storm clouds had cleared out i started experimenting with my Camera messing with exposure. I walked into the backyard and spotted a clound to the south east of me which would be in the direction of the Gulf. I had not seen anything until i was examining the lighting in my photos a few minutes later. I just so happens however the object seemd to be emitting its own light though it could be lit by the sun which was behind me. there are no reflective surfaces that i can find around me wher ei was taking the photo. I also note that in the particular photo it appears in the aperture was turned way down to where and almost white hazy sky is a deep dark blue and the cloud looks gray yet there is a green sphere glowing boldly in the photo which isnt present in any of the other photos. i took more photos to try and duplicate but cant. also i was using a polarized filter all my filters and lenses are spotless and scratch free. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF ORIGINAL REPORT)) Green UFO Reported Earlier Over Galveston County Texas I sent in a report earlier today about a green object in the sky, i had looked at my other photos and didnt see anything in them but i continued to try to find another explanation and succeeded it turns out there was in fact a spot on my lens or filter took reference to the location of the object and found the same object in other photos at the same reference point in the frame. I am not interested in False Reports therefore i decided to send this to let you know it has been identified. ((END ADDENDUM));29.5183;-95.0977000000002
Hovering light near Galveston, TX.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star, but cannot be certain.  PD));2010-09-12 03:45:00;1:15;Hovering light near Galveston, TX At around 3:45 am, I sighted a light SE - SSE of League City, possibly over Galveston Bay, about 30 degrees off the horizon.  The craft blinked and moved in a way not possible by helicopter or other aircraft.  The movements were definitely unnatural, very quick, with almost a hovering characteristic.   The craft appeared to move away over time, but zigged and zagged and changed elevation the entire time.   I watched it for about an hour and 15 minutes.
