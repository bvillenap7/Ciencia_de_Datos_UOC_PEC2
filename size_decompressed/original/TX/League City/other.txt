2 red/2 green octagon shaped object in sky.;2014-10-10 20:54:00;2 minutes;2 red/2green octagon shaped object in sky Object was octagon shaped and had 2 bright green lights and 2 bright red lights, it appeared to be spinning counter-clock wise and it made no sound.  I rolled my window down to see if I could hear it, but again made no noise.  It appeared to be about the size of the bottom of a house , not sure how to explain.   My daughter (15) and I were on FM518 in League City, TX, when we saw this object.  At first we thought it was a plane, or helicopter, but it was neither.   I asked my daughter, Where did it go? and all she could say is momma it disappeared.;29.5183;-95.0977000000002
It was bright line of light. You would think it was a shooting stat but it wasn’t moving just hovering. ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-07 06:00:00;3 minutes;It was bright line of light. You would think it was a shooting stat but it wasn’t moving just hovering. It was a large line that stayed in place for a long time. I took a video of it and it doesn’t do it justice but definitely noticeable. It was in between a cluster of stars so I know it was far and within the stars.;29.5183;-95.0977000000002
