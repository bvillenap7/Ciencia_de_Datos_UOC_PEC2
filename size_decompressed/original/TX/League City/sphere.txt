Possible UFO sighting traveling on I-45 towards Galveston.;2011-09-12 20:12:00;3 seconds;Possible UFO sighting traveling on I-45 towards Galveston. I looked up at the sky and saw a blue light like you would see on an aircraft but it was just one light and is moved so fast that I just saw it for a few seconds.  It was there then gone in the clouds. It was around 8:30 pm so it was dark outside, not sure if there were clouds but thats what it seemed like when i saw the light and then it was gone.  Not sure what I saw but I know it moved way to fast to be a plane or helicopter.  I was traveling down I-45 heading towards Galveston.

Two stationary, silent, super bright white spheres about 100-200 feet in the air.;2012-01-12 19:00:00;30 seconds;Two stationary, silent, super bright white spheres about 100-200 feet in the air. On FM517 westbound, my son and I noted 2 extremely bright balls of light to the northwest, approx 2 miles away (estimated by using the lights of an elementary school located in that area.)  The lights were about the height of a radio tower, with one appearing several feet higher than the other.  There are several radio and cell phone towers in the general vicinity but none in that area and all the others have red lights.  There is an interstate in that direction as well--but it lights were visible (and are orange sodium arc lamps anyway.) I have never seen this type of bright, pure white light before. The two spheres appeared to be stationary.  They did not resemble spotlights (like from a helicopter) or any other common light source we could think of.  We watched them intently for 30 seconds or so from an unobstructed view, though they were visible through the trees for approx 2 minutes as we drove. We did not note any mechanical sounds or aircraft in the area.;29.5183;-95.0977000000002
