Two identical UFO's spotted, one appeared to lose power and altitude.;2013-07-13 21:00:00;3 minutes;Two identical UFO's spotted, one appeared to lose power and altitude. I'll just come right out and say it, we saw two UFO's right at about 2100 Central.  The first one appeared to be basically traveling from South to North as if possibly heading for Ellington AFB.   It had a solid reddish/orange light and no normal flashing navigation lights. Just a solid glow.  We, with our best guesses, estimated it to be flying at about 500-600 feet and it didn't appear to be traveling very fast.  Maybe 75 - 100 MPH or so.   There was very little if any wind at the time.  It was hard to really gauge how big it was because it was hard to tell how far away it was.   It flew completely silent, no noise at all.  It continued on its course until it went out of sight behind the trees.   The second one appeared about a minute later on the same heading as if a carbon copy of the first but as soon as this one got almost directly in front of us the light flickered a few times and went completely out then we could see the roundish or maybe octagonal shape of 'what! ever' it was.  As soon as the light went out it began a gradual descent and it appeared to have gone down due to loss of power.   I drove around for a while to see if I could spot any suspicious vehicles or objects in the area and I didn't see any.

8-9 Orange glowing objects in single file line moving across the sky.;2019-09-01 20:30:00;5 minutes;8-9 Orange glowing objects in single file line moving across the sky. My wife, my son and I were headed home from eating, when we observed several glowing lights in the sky.  They were orange balls in a line heading from the Southeast to he Northwest.  We exited our car and started to video them.  As soon as the lead object made a hard left turn to the Southwest, it immediately shot off into the sky and disappeared.  I video taped the objects, and my wife shot video as well.  This happened at 2030 hours CST, Temperature 89 degrees, clear skies, and the wind was out of the east at 7 mph.  These orange glowing lights were in a single file line and were no doubt following each other.   They appeared to be several thousand feet off the ground.   I'm a retired Police Officer and worked night shift for most all of my career and have never seen anything like this.;29.5183;-95.0977000000002
