And then i saw some reflection, so I knew they were metal.  at fist I saw 4 they made a triangle with one on top,  and then there were five and then six.  they dissapeared and then come back.  As they moved I saw more and more 20, then about 50 then about 100.  They looked like white fireworks in the sky.  They would appear and then dissaper in 2 different sets.  A passenger plane flew into the direction of the lights and then they were gone. It is a clear day today not a cloud in the sky.  I know this is april fools day but this is no joke.;29.5183;-95.0977000000002
