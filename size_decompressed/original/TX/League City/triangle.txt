On or around 12/9/04, I was on my way home from working late. While driving South on IH-45 approaching the League City, TX exit, I saw (as though it appeared out of nowhere) a triangular shaped craft sitting very low (maybe 25 ft above the ground).  I had time to see it, look to my left to see if I could pull over on the side of the road, look back and up - pulling myself closer to the steering wheel of my truck.  As I went underneath it, I could see the bottom of the craft - dark, not smooth.  It was dark outside and there were lights with a yellowish global glow/look to them all the way around the craft which made it's shape very easy to define.  Looking in my rearview mirror, it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));29.5183;-95.0977000000002
