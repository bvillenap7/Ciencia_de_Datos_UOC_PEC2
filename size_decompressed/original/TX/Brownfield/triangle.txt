Dual traingle craft spotted.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from licensed pilot.  PD));2012-05-02 11:10:00;5 Minutes;Dual traingle craft spotted While flying south toward Seminole, TX, in a helicopter under night vision goggles, myself and another crewmember observed a triangular shaped craft (actually it was more like a small triangle closely in front of another larger triangle).  There were many lights observed on the bottom of the craft.  The craft was flying fairly fast from south to north and appeared to be around 20,000 feet msl or so.  There was nothing particularly unusual about the flight characteristics however its odd shape caught our attention.;33.1688;-102.2748

It was being followed by a large flying triangle of red lights.  In the sky ther was a formation of sets of triangle patterns in the sky,they look like stars but would shift directions.  The triangle of red lights hovered over the white orbe pulling it in and soon right on top, both flying together at same speed and dissapear together.  Soon after the sighting ther would be helicopters,at least 6 in the sky, like they wher looking for something.
