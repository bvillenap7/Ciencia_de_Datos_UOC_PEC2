Object, or objects seen over Jones County, TX, 10-15-11.;2011-10-15 20:30:00;10 sec.;Object, or objects seen over Jones County, TX, 10-15-11. Object, or objects, appeared in the North sky moving due South in a straight line toward Abilene and Dyess AFB.  When the object, or objects, were directly overhead, we attempted to shine an LED flashlight at it.  It, or they, did not seem to be at a low altitude as they did not reflect any of the flashlight.  They were yellow in color. It appeared to be more of a formation of smaller boomerang shaped objects in a diagonal formation that were moving around their individual positions as they were moving in a line.  When they were almost out of view, atleast one of them made an abrupt turn due East before they were completely out of view.;32.7465;-99.8928
