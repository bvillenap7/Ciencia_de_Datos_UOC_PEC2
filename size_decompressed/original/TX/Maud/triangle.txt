Triangle yellowish/peach light zig zag 3hrs over northeast Texas sky at night.;2014-04-26 17:00:00;3 hours;Triangle yellowish/peach light zig zag 3hrs over northeast Texas sky at night. 4/26/14 @17:00 hours an object caught my eye due to the size & color.  I thought that it had to be a planet, an airplane?  With a yellowish/peach tint that shown bright when it moved very fast side to side & in circular motions. It looked as to wobble in motion.  The movements were not in any pattern or sequence, though it did move quiet often at random. Then would hover a bit & dart side to side again.  Some movements were in a sporadic jerky circular motion.  This went on for approx 3 hrs at least. There was also another faint light that seemed to be far above.
