Large shadow flew over head very fast;2006-11-15 19:00:00;5 minutes;Large shadow flew over head very fast I was walking my dog in a park set between an apartment complex on the North (approximately) side, condos and a school on the South side  this park is located aproximately 3/4 mile from a small/medium sized airport.  It is small, but not rural and jets fly in and out as well as small aircraft.  It is also in the flight path to the Dallas airport and the DFW airport.  Those planes fly higher.  Usually there are at least 4 visible aircraft in the area (often more at that time of evening), most flying higher in route to somewhere else.  I am an educated person, employed as a software developer for a medium sized software company.  What I saw was higher than any of the planes and moved faster than any I have seen.  I grew up near an airforce base so I have seen some fast aircraft. (even the stealth bomber when it was still secret).  This seemed to be huge because of the altitude it seemed to be traveling.  Mostly what I saw was an outline, like a shadow moving across the sky.  It was too uniform to be a cloud in a jet stream like one of my friends suggested.  It moved approximately south from one side of the sky to another and dissapeared.  I had been lookng at the big dipper when I noticed it.  about a minute later it appeared again moving in the opposite direction.  The shape made me think of a boat moving fast in the water - the front (based on direction) was shaped like the wake a boat would make the back was similar shape but smaller. The best way I could describe it was if you were standing on the bottom of a lake and a large ship passed over very fast, that is the shape I saw.;32.9569;-96.8317000000002
