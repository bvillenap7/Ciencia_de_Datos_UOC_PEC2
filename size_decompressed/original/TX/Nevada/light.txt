On April 17, 2008 @ approximately 9:15 we were outside watching a storm come in from the west. The lightning was all around and as we were watching it....some lights appeared from the east. I saw the flashing white lights over the tree line  on our property  and told my husband to look. When he turned to look....the white lights were gone and then all of a sudden we saw a row of about 15 to 20 rectangular orange lights aligned in a row flashing in a north to south then south to north sequence. I believe that I have seen this object before and so my husband got in his truck to see if he could get a look beyond the tree line. He returned about 10 to 15 minutes later and said that he could see nothing and yet the flashing lights continued after he got back home. We could not explain the lights. The object had no sound and was huge. ( we estimate about 150 to 200 yards long) and that the object was approximately 1/4 to Â½ mile away. My husband refused to let me call the police in fear of ridicule, but we both believe that we have seen an UFO.;33.0564;-96.3903
