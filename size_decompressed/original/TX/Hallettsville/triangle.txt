It made no sounds and floated by like a balloon but moved to fast to keep up with on foot . It passed behind some trees and i ran to try to get ahead of it , but it was gone as quickly as it appeared . With the exception of the glare on its sides whch appeared to me to be dim lights , it could just as easily been anything . The light could have been reflecting off something else because for what I could see , this thing almost blended perfectly with the night sky except for its reflective ability . Maybe it was a stealth , but I think that if I had a rifle , that it was close enough to hit . I just want to know if anyone else saw this thing in my area , and was this a real sighting .;29.4365;-96.9171
