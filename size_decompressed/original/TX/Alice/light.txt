Two truck drivers witness two, separate displays of peculiar yellow lights in the night sky.;2006-02-08 20:03:00;20 min.;Two truck drivers witness two, separate displays of peculiar yellow lights in the night sky. Telephoned Report:  A truck driver telephoned from his truck to report that he and his co-driver had just witnessed a curious display of several yellow, or orangish, lights in the night sky.  The witnesses were driving north on State Route 281, and were located an estimated 5 miles to the north of the town of Alice, Texas, when they witnessed the first display of lights at 20:03 hrs. (Central Standard Time), which consisted of two yellow lights to the northwest of the witnesses.  A second display of three yellow lights was witnessed in approximately the same relative position to the observers at 20:24 hrs., which lasted only momentarily.   ((NUFORC Note:  Texas State Route 281 runs on a straight north-south meridian north of Alice, TX.  The first possibility we address in a case like this is a launch of flares, possibly over a military reservation.  Using Mapquest and Google Earth, we can find no military facilities in the direction, or location, that the observers reported.  Please see report from Apache Junction, AZ, for the evening of the same date.  Witness reported two yellow lights to the east (??) of Apache Junction at;27.7447000000001;-98.0819999999997
