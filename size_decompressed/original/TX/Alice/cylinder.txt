possible cruise missle sighting;2005-08-05 21:25:00;3 seconds;possible cruise missle sighting AT FIRST,Appeared to be a falling star, or suspected shuttle craft debris: with a long tail, due to re-entry.   The Sighting was in the field directly behind the John Deere,tractor company.  The field is North West of the Hiway 359, and Hiway 44 intersection,on the East side of town.  The craft was cylindrical. appeared to be sky blue. Poor lighting, sky blue as best as we could see. It came about 200 feet from impacting the field, and made adjustments.  And began to head west at about 60 MPH I repeat it made adjustments, not unlike a cruise missle. Spycraft? For a craft to withstand re-entry, and make adjustments, and continue on a path horizontal to the ground, It is obviously man-made technology. We were 9 motorcycle riders heading south on 359 from Mathis Texas. Russel at the Alice Newspaper, one of the riders, also witnessed this sighting, and was a topic of our discussion shortly after. I do not believe any reports were made. We were approaching our turn west on hiway 44, at 9:25pmwhen we witnessed this sighting. Just F.Y.I..;27.7447000000001;-98.0819999999997
