((HOAX??))  2 white, shiny spheres.;2007-11-03 03:00:00;10 minutes;2 white, shiny spheres I was laying in the grass in my Grandmother's backyard looking at the sky one day when I saw a white, shiny ball moving across the sky towards the south. It was traveling so fast I only saw it or a few seconds.  I went inside to tell my grandmother.  When I came back out and laid back down in the grass, I saw another UFO go straight across the sky in the same direction & speed as the first. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax, we suspect.

Orange ball of light floating very close to ground;2020-03-07 02:34:00;Few minutes;Orange ball of light floating very close to ground We were outside listening to music and talking around a fire, and I had a feeling to turn around, especially since I’m always looking at the sky, but I turn around and I noticed a bright hit orange ball floating past my neighbors house, I just remember saying real loud “WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?!, and it floated over the alley into the vacant lot behind my neighbors and it floated to the next street until we couldn’t see it because of trees and houses.  This light was floating along at a steady pace and it wasn’t floating high in the sky, this thing was about 40-50 feet from the ground.  I did take video and do have some pictures which I did catch an object.;27.7447000000001;-98.0819999999997
