A triangle shaped object with three bright lights;2011-10-03 19:00:00;2 minutes;a triangle shaped object with three bright lights Well it was about 8:00 pm here in alice texas. I was inside watching a yankees baseball game and my girlfriends nephew asked me to throw the football with him outside. So i get up and walk outside and start throwing.  And about 10 minutes into throwing i look up and all of a sudden i see three bright lights.  Kinda looked like a triangle but the only thing i was only able to see were the lights.   And as soon as i saw it i kept calling my girlfriend about 5 to 6 times but by the time she got up it vanished.  I tried to see if it would appear again but nothing.
