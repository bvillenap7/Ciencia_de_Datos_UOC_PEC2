BRIGHT LINE OF LIGHTS OVER THE MOUNTAINS,  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly twinkling stars?  PD));2011-05-02 21:00:00;2 hrs;BRIGHT LINE OF LIGHTS OVER THE MOUNTAINS, MY ROOMMATE AND I WERE OUT AND SAW A BIG LINE OF LIGHTS OVER THE MOUNTAINS ON THE NORTHWEST PART OF THE BORDER BETWEEN PRESIDIO, TEXAS, AND OJINAGA, CHIHUAHUA, THEY WERE BLINKING, IN A RED AND ORANGE BRIGHT COLOR, WE COULD SUPPOSE IT WAS ABOUT 3 MILES FROM TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN TO THE BOTTOM AND THEY FORMED LIKE A KITE FIGURE. WE DIDN'T KNOW WERE TO REPORT IT BUT IT WAS THERE FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR, WE WONDER IF IT'S STILL THERE.  ANYONE HAS AN IDEA ABOUT THIS?  ON THE OTHER HAND, WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL SEISMIC ACTIVITY IN THE AREA THE PAST FEW DAYS, WHEN IT NEVER HAPPENED AROUND HERE ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly twinkling stars?  PD));29.5634;-104.3532
