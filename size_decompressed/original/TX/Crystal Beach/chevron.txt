Small brown chevron-shaped object over water at Crystal Beach.;2005-04-23 12:00:00;30 seconds;Small brown chevron-shaped object over water at Crystal Beach. My sister was on the porch of the beach cabin and noticed a brown chevron-shaped object travelling 100' above the water from east to west.  She said several other people saw it.   I told her it was probably a frigate bird.  She got rather defensive and said it was NOT a bird, that it didn't have a head or feet, didn't flap the wings, didn't make any sound.  She couldn't tell how far out to sea it was and couldn't estimate the size, although she said it did not seem to be very large.   It rapidly disappeared towards Galveston Island.;29.4246;-94.6901
