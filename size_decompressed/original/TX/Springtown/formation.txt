Bright lights appearing in single file and disappearing into the distance.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-23 05:30:00;Approx 3 minutes;Bright lights appearing in single file and disappearing into the distance. Very high in the atmosphere. Lights in mostly single file formation traveling from SW to NE. Noticed six or seven initially. Then noticed more appearing from seemingly nowhere. Very vague dim light at first growing brighter as they traveled. Once they were in full view they were as bright as the brightest star in that area. They seamed to appear one after the other in groups of four to seven equally spaced except occasionally two very close to each other. Could not tell where they were appearing from. Was as though they were skimming through the upper atmosphere straight above me then disappearing into the distance. Their were no flashing beacons or sound that I could hear. I stood there and counted for several minutes, counted twenty two before I went back inside to wake the wife. Of course by the time she returned with me, there was nothing.;32.9658;-97.6866
