Strange craft and flight pattern seen in Springtown Texas night sky.;2016-09-20 22:13:00;3 minutes;Strange craft and flight pattern seen in Springtown Texas night sky. Every night at about 10pm I step outside for a cigarette and to see the Texas stars. Tonight, some sort of craft, which literally had no sound flew in an odd pattern overhead. Large planes, small private craft, and at times helicopters fly over, but obviously they all have sound.  This was some sort of aircraft with a lit arc on top that was visible, with about 3 to 4 spread out lights underneath that appeared to be rotating.  I was in the USAF – and I’ve NEVER seen a craft like that, whether from the flightline or up in the sky. Plus the flight pattern was extremely swift and “rounded” without any sound.  It actually made me feel strange to watch it…like a sinking feeling - I’ve never experienced that with visualizing aircraft before. The arced light was like a constant bar/stream, and the lights underneath were rotating.  It wasn’t a toy, because I work in advertising, and I know what toy or drone craft look like.  So for me, this was something completely unidentifiable/odd/unknown.  Out in Springtown, if it were of conventional technology, I would have heard some sort of noise from the aircraft –but it was silent. It flew in like a slingshot style of pattern – not a conventional straight overhead pattern.  The lights never “tilted”. From my iPhone compass, I was literally standing at 32 degrees, 57’28” N 97 degrees, 40’36” W,  860 ft elevation.;32.9658;-97.6866
