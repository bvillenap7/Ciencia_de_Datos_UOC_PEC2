I had walked outside to call my dog inside and i had looked up into the sky and saw an orange glowing light moving across the sky very slowly it did not flicker. i thought it was the ISS so i went and got my step dad and my little sister who then came outside and saw the object in the air also. My step dad has an app on his cell phone the shows where the ISS and all sats are at any given time so he checked where the known Sats and ISS where. ISS did not pass over for another 2 minutes. The object was moving from east to west We then watched the orange glowing light disapear. We then watched ISS pass at the right time over the other side of the horizon from west to east or in that general area. Also no sound was made. This was not an airplane.;32.9658;-97.6866
