High altitude / velocity cigar shaped craft over North Texas without contrail;2015-11-21 08:40:00;1 minute;High altitude / velocity cigar shaped craft over North Texas without contrail I was walking back from the mailbox and was looking at the contrails and cirrus clouds.   I noticed what I thought was a jet in the western sky flying from east to west, but then noticed it wasnâ€™t making a contrail.   I stopped to look more closely and saw that it was an oblong (short cigar shaped) object without wings.  It was slightly too long and thin to be any of the blimps/dirigibles I had every seen.  It was very high, guessing somewhere above the level of the contrails and moving very fast for what I thought the altitude to be.  It appeared very light grey/tan, just a little darker than the clouds.  I was hoping to get another look after it passed behind a very wide contrail, but never saw it again.;32.9658;-97.6866
