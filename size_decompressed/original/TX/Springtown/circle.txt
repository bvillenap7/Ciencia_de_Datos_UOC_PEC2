Military helicopters escort UFO off to Fort Worth Miliary Base.;2008-01-18 22:30:00;30 minutes;Military helicopters escort UFO off to Fort Worth Miliary Base. we have had several sightings in Springtown Texas and Azle Texas back in Jan 18th. It was all over the news. I know for a fact because one happened right above my roof top. I live in Springtown. The military even had 6 helicopters surrounding it. It was round and had three rolls of white lights. The ufo was hovering. The military knew that I had heard the choppers and they were out there about 15 minutes before I stepped out on my back porch. We live on this country road an I was out watching the event. One helicopter shot a tracer off directly in front of the ufo to scare it into moving. When it did the choppers surrounded it and herded it off toward the military base in Fort Worth. So you can add that to the map. I also saw one back in Dec 05 again right above my roof top. That was my first sighting. It was scarey. This place I am told is a hot spot magnet for the darn sightings. ((NUFORC Note:  The sighting the witness refers to may have been the events over Stephenville, TX.  That sighting occurred on January 08, 2008.  PD));32.9658;-97.6866
