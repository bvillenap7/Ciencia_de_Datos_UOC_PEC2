SAW BRIGHT LIGHT IN SKY THAT FOLLOWED ME.;2006-02-13 04:30:00;2 hours;SAW BRIGHT LIGHT IN SKY THAT FOLLOWED ME, AND APPEARED TO HAVE OTHER ORBS AND A TRIANGULAR AIRCRAFT DESEND FROM IT I DELIVER THE FORT WORTH STAR TELEGRAM, AND I WAS OUT DOING MY PAPER ROUTE. AROUND 4:00 IN THE MORNING I NOTICED A BIG BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT IN THE SKY. IT WAS MOVING, BUT SLOWLY. THEN I NOTICED A SMALLER WHITE LIGHT LOOKING TO BE A PLANE OR SOMETHING RIGHT BY IT. THEY SPLIT UP. IT WAS NOT TOO MUCH LONGER THAN THAT WHEN I NOTICED THE BIG BRIGHT LIGHT SEEMED TO BE FOLLOWING ME. WHEN I WOULD STOP MY CAR AND LOOK AT IT, THATS WHEN IT WOULD START MOVING TOWARDS ME. AT ONE POINT WHILE I WAS STOPPED STARING AT IT, I FLASHED MY HEADLIGHTS AT IT TO SEE IF IT WOULD STOP MOVING AGAIN. (I STILL THOUGH MAYBE I WAS SEEING THINGS.) AFTER I FLASHED MY LIGHT IT STARTED COMING DOWN TOWARDS THE GROUND AT FIRST AND THEN STARTED DIRECTLY TOWARD ME AT A HIGH SPEED.. SO I PUT MY PEDAL TO THE METAL, AND TOOK OFF. IT WAS BACK IN THE SKY AT THIS POINT. AND I LOOKED A LITTLE CLOSER, AND I SAW ABOUT 10 OTHER LIGHTS FLYING RIGHT NEXT TO IT, BUT THEY WERE SMALLER AND DIMMER.. AND THEY JUST DISSAPAEARED. I WAS FREAKING OUT BY THIS POINT. I CALLED MY FRIEND TOMMY WHO WAS AT WORK TELLING HIM WHAT I WAS SEEING. HE SAID I WAS CRAZY. WELL, WHILE I WAS TALKING TO HIM, WHAT SEEMED TO BE AN AIRCRAFT OF SOME SORT LOOKED LIKE IT CAME OUT OF THE BALL OF LIGHT. IT WAS FLASHING RED, AND JUST WENT STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR UNTIL I COULDN'T SEE IT ANYMORE. IT WASN'T TOO FAST. AT THAT POINT I STARTED CRYING, I WAS REALLY FREAKED OUT. I STARTED HEARING LEAVES RUSTLE AROUND MY CAR, AND IN THE FIELD WHERE I WAS BY I SAW A FEW FLASHING RED LIGHTS, MORE LIKE ORBS. I WENT TO ROLLL MY WINDOW UP BECAUSE I WAS SCARED, AND MY WINDOWS WOULDN'T ROLL UP. THEY ARE POWER WINDOWS, AND DIDNT EVEN MAKE THE SOUND AS IF THEY WERE TRYING TO ROLL UP, IT'S LIKE THE POWER WAS OFF. AND MY CAR STARTED MAKING A STRANGE SQUEALING SOUND, LIKE WHEN PEOPLE START THEIR CARS AND THEIR BELTS SQUEAL. AND IT WAS ALSO VERY WARM RIGHT AROUD THE CAR, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ABOUT 20 DEGREES OUT. WELL, AT THE END OF MY ROUTE WHEN I WAS DELIVERING THE NEWSPAPERS TO MY STORE, THE STORE CLERK WASN'T THERE YET, SO I JUST GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND STARED AT THE LIGHT. IT WAS 7:00 AM THEN, AND IT WAS JUST STARTING TO GET LIGHT OUTSIDE. WELL, ANOTHER CRAFT CAME FROM THE LIGHT. THIS I KNOW WAS AN AIRCRAFT FOR SURE, BECAUSE IT WAS FLTING AT THE LEVEL PLANES DO, MAYBE EVEN A TAD BIT CLOSER. IT WAS A TRIANGLE. NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS, JUST A TRIANGLE  SHAPED AIRCRAFT. IT WAS GREY IN COLOR. THE THING THAT REALLY STOOD OUT THE MOST TO ME THOUGH WAS THE LIGHTS AROUND THE TRIANGLE. THEY WERE RED WHITE AND BLUE I BELIEVE, ONLY THEY WERE FLASHING EXTREMELY FAST. JUST LIKE A STROBE LIGHT. I HAVE NEVER SEEN AN AIRPLANE HAVE LIGHTS THAT FLASHED THAT FAST, AND IF THERE IS SUCH A THING, PLEASE TELL ME, BECAUSE I AM FREAKING OUT. THE LIGHTS WERE DIM TOO. IT MADE A REALLY STRANGE SOUND.WELL, MY STORE CLERK PULLED UP FOR WORK, AND THE SHIP WAS STILL IN THE SKY, HE SAW ME LOOKING AT THE SKY, AND GOT OUT TO SEE WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT. SO HE SAW IT TOO, JUST NOT AS CLOSE AS I DID. I TOLD HIM ABOUT SEEING THE OTHER STUFF, AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE PREVIOUS NIGHT HE HAD SAW THE BIG BRIGHT LIGHT. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN TO ME BEFORE, AND I AM GOING NUTS. THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THERE IS LIFE OUT THERE NOW... IF ANYONE ELSE HAS SEEN SIMILAR THINGS, I'D LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT IT... THANKS;32.9658;-97.6866
