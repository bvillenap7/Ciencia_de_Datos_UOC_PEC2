Witnessed, two gray objects flying without lights and sound.;2008-08-02 22:30:00;15 MIN;Witnessed, two gray objects flying without lights and sound. At approximately 10:30pm, I witnessed two objects flying overhead. The sky was clear so I was able to see the shapes. There appeared to be no visible lights on the objects. The first one I saw was like the shape of a pointed roof top. It seemed to be smaller than the second one, Although they appeared to be at the same altitude. The second one was in the shape of a very large boomerang and both seemed to glide through the air without sound. They were both gray in color and flew in a straight line. I am a lover of the universe and always venture out at night to view the stars. Being a 36 year old artist/painter by trade, conditioned me to pay attention to detail and observe things closely.;31.1521;-99.3462
