Saucer shaped object seen between Brady and Cherokee Texas;1970-08-26 23:00:00;1 1/2 hours;Saucer shaped object seen between Brady and Cherokee Texas We saw a saucer shaped object.It had lights that looked like the game simon.The lights circled ,red, blue, green,around it.It made no sound that I could hear and it sure wasn't an airplane.I couldn't tell really what shape it was but the lights circled it so I assume it was round.This happen a long time ago ,but when I found your site I just had to write you about it.We were so scared,my husband,myself,my girlfriend and her boyfriend were riding around out in the country about 30 minutes from Brady.My friend and I decided to get in the back of the pickup,I was 15 and she was 16 or there abouts.Anyway we were just having fun.I don't know where this thing came from,it was there in the next minute.It was very close to the ground and scared us so bad we got the guys attention and got back inside the truck.The guys didn't know what it was but we hightailed it back to town(Brady).It followed us all the way back to town.When we got in the city lights we couldn't see it any more.So we decided to go out to the race track to see if it was still around,about two miles.And sure enough there it was,so we hurry to turn around and go back to town.Well we said ok lets go out to the airport(real small one).Anyway when we get to the airport there it is again,scared us so bad we went home.I asked my friend if she remembered it a while back and she said she did.Anyway that was the first time I had ever seen anything like it. But a few years later,about 1978 we had moved out by the airport.One nite I don't even recall why I was outside but something came over my house so low I could see the underside of it but I can't recall the shape it was just huge.It made no sound and looked like it was gliding over, so close to the roof of my house.But for some reason I didn't feel scared.It was a gray steel color no shine and no lights on it. My sister lived up the road and I was telling her about it and she said she and some others were standing on her porch.She said it landed in the field across the road. I promise you I'm not telling a fib.It really happened and I'm more aware of the skys, but I have never seen anything else.My husband is a ((deleted--specialist in construction and related trades)) and I'm a retired ((deleted--service industry)).  I just wish I could remember more about what happened.I would like to get together with the others and see what they remember about that nite.We no longer live in Brady but still have friend and relatives there.Thank you for your site,people laugh when I tell them we saw a ufo when we were younge but I can tell you I'm a believer for sure.Also I'm guessing about the date,I know school was just out for summer or about to start because it was initation night in Brady ,when the older high school kids initate the freshmen in to school.I have written a pretty long letter trying to explain so delete whatever you need to.Also I would like to say that it happened about 9:30 at nite but I didn't know how to put the time in for that.You can contact me via e-mail if you need to or call but it has been a long time now.I don't know how you would be able to get any information except from the four of us now.Thank you for your patience in reading this long letter.
