Sulphur Springs Lights similar to Phoenix Lights.;2013-07-04 21:50:00;45-90 minutes;Sulphur Springs Lights similar to Phoenix Lights On the night of July 4, 2013, my family and I were driving away from a fireworks show at the country club, and as my parents were on their way to their house(my wife and I were with my parents), I saw some weird lights about a half of a mile in front of us.   My dad was driving on the outskirts of town, a loop that circles part of the town, and we stopped and parked my dad's truck off of the loop to the location these lights were traveling.   These were kind of an amberish-orange color, and I would say there was about 6 or 7 lights grouped together, and then two other lights were trailing behind the rest.   The whole thing was really weird, because there was absolutely no sound.  These lights were about the same elevation of a helicopter that is on its way to land, so maybe a couple hundred feet above ground.   The best way to describe this event is the Phoenix lights that happened in 1997 in Phoenix, AZ.   These lights were going very slow, maybe about 10-15 miles per! hour, no sound, very close to us, amberish-orange color, and two lights were trailing behind the rest.   I do not know what to make of this, but I will definitely never forget it.  My wife, parents, and I were all witnesses to this.;33.1321;-95.5925
I was outside and saw about 15-20 fireballs flying in a weird design.;2017-12-30 08:00:00;10 Minutes;I was outside and saw about 15-20 fireballs flying in a weird design all stayed the same but moved really fast I ran inside the second I saw them and was like no way this is fucking happening wtf could that be other than a ufo and grabbed my cell phone but by the time i got the video recorder going the last of the lights disapeared behind clouds or something it was dark so i dont even know if there was clouds.  It was to big to be man made ship,Could have been 20-30 missles or something getting shot somewhere but why over north east texas? Where would 30 missles be going in texas?  I dunno man I wish I was fast enough to record it I never thought I would ever see anything I couldnt explain but damn sure did last night.  The only reason Im on this site is because I was googling 12/30/17 weird lights/ufo over texas, but I dont seem to be able to find anyone else posting a picture or video or anything about it. I cant be the only one who saw this thing!;33.1321;-95.5925
