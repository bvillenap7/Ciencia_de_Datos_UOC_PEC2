Saw one while going through a neighborhood on way to taking kids out, didn't hear anything but something told me to look up.  Just as I did there was a slow low moving ufo the size of a RV coming over a house and tree.  It was moving very very slow.  It was maybe a foot or two from touching the top of the tree.  I screamed look and everyone looked out the window.   It had a pure solid gold bottom the rest was like a black onyx looking material, it had green red and white lights that flashed in a sequenced pattern.  It faded away.  This is the second ufo I've seen within a year,   First one is the Thanksgiving before,  We walked outside, something said look up.  Right when I did a neon blue dot streaked across sky stopped long enough for us to see then darted off.;33.1321;-95.5925
