I thought the large bright white light was an aircraft flying overhead, but after 20 minutes realized it was still in the same position in the sky, so called a young girl and her husband over to see if they knew what it was. We figured it was a planet so they left. An hour later, it was still there in the same position in the sky when I noticed that it had a circular shape with white lights around the edges of it. Inside the center was a Y and a semi circular shape underneath the Y. I looked at it until it got dark outside and then left. At 5 a m I looked outside and saw that it was still  there in the same spot, so I hurriedly dressed and when I went outside, it was gone.;33.1321;-95.5925
