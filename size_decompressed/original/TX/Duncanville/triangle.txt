Then, an object that like a cluster of dim stars in line, then a single object and then another. The first object: 8 - 10 dim star like objects in a V shape moving from north to south then west. About 4 seconds, moving fast and no sound, and seemed only about 500-1000 ft. high. Looked solid. The second object: a cluster of dim stars in a line, large, moving from north to south very fast. About 5 seconds and higher altitude. The third object: a dim larger star, moving from north to south fast, same altitude as second object: Could be meteor, but no tail. Fourth object: Straight up, looked like a satelite going from north to south, but much faster than previous seen, and also shorter viewing time than other satelites seen, 3 seconds.;32.6393018404908;-96.908283435583
