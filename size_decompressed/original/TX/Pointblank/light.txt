My mom and my sister and I were inside the house having a conversation. Me and my sister were facing the windows. (Facing east)When all of a sudden we saw two separate lights next to each other in the middle of the lake hovering (They weren't low in the water but they weren't up high in the sky ) just out of nowhere the lights turned on, then they took off southbound up to the sky.  Me and my sister looked at each other and then just kinda blew it off like maybe it was a shooting star or a drone.  But its was too low for a shooting star and it was too windy outside to be a drone. So we continued our conversation.  All of a sudden (like 5 minutes later) we saw another one come back down to the same spot.  And dissapeared. We ran outside but there was no longer anything there too see.  We tried going back to our cameras but it was out of view.;30.7606;-95.2274
