Strange lights appeared in the sky near Rising Star,Texas;2010-02-24 20:00:00;10 minutes;Strange lights appeared in the sky near Rising Star,Texas I was traveling south on hwy 183 between Cisco,Tx. and Rising Star ,tx.  It was between 8pm and 8:10 pm.Looking South,  I noticed a series of high altitude very bright lights in the dark sky.  I passed a car parked on the roadway that seemed to be watching the lights also. The lights dimmed and went dark. There were no aircraft in the sky that i could see or aircraft lights to indicate it was a plane or helicopter. Then a whole series of lights came on and covered a large area.They came on all at once and dimmed and went out independantly.  If there was any movement of the lights it wasnt much.Not like a meteor or space junk entering the atmosphere. The lights were not colored just white and bright.All the lights went out. Then after 30 seconds 3 came back on.I shined my spotlight in the direction of the lights. The lights dimmed and went out and again there were no signs of aircraft lights. There were several cars on the hiway and you could not help but to notice the occu! rance.;32.1317;-98.9841
