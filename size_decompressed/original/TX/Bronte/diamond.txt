bronte sighting;2001-07-30 01:30:00;10-15 min;bronte sighting i was driving on the back country road, then all of a sudden i saw this pulsing red light in front of me.  it then came closer and closer and glided over the left hand side of my car.  i could see under neath that is had these pulsating red lights.  like four lines of them that kinda made it in the shape of a triangle.  i then proceeded to slow down cause i had my camera and was going to take a pic.  then i looked behind me, the object had a bright white beam of light comming from the bottom of it.  didnt get to take a pic.  took off down the road going 120 hoping a cop would pull me over.... never been so frightened in my life...........;31.8774;-100.2986
