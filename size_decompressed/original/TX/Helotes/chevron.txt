Translucent white in color and bird shape.;2015-02-18 23:45:00;4-5 seconds;Translucent white in color and bird shape I had been out star gazing for a couple of hours since we have a clear sky tonight (2-18-2015).   I had been utilizing an Iphone app (Sky View) to track stars, planets, etc.  I was just hoping to see a shooting star, the space station, or even a satellite.   At about 11:45 PM, I saw what looked like a large bird gliding.  In size, it looked like a crane or flamingo might look like but, at an altitude that a hawk is at while seeking prey, (150 ft).   It was translucent white in color and moved from the lighter part of the sky (where the city is at) towards the darker part (away from the city and towards the country).   Maybe lasted about 4 seconds and as I tried to focus on the object it disappeared.   The wings never moved and it did not make any sounds. I should have been able to see it clearer since it was moving towards the darker sky.;29.6321;-98.7542
