Blue Sphere moving at high rate of speed;2002-01-31 21:57:00;30 seconds;Blue Sphere moving at high rate of speed It was about 9:55 and my wife and I were watching the moon just rising in the eastern sky when I saw a large blueish white sphere looking light traveling along the eastern sky. It was moving north to south parallel to the curvature of the horizon. It traveled for approximately 30 seconds at a tremendously high rate of speed. There was no trail behind it, and it did not lose shape, speed, or intesity as long as we could see it. Did anybody else see this? Please submit your sighting. As it dissapeared into the southeastern sky it almost looked like afterburners of a fighter jet. With the speed of it, I have never seen something like this in my life.
