Bright light in south-west sky from south Elgin.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible aircraft w/ landing light, or a star?  PD));2005-11-03 19:00:00;10 minutes;Bright light in south-west sky from south Elgin Light that looked to be a very bright northern star 220 degrees in the south-west sky from south  Elgin. (I know this because of the direction of my dish on the roof)   It was in the general direction of ABI airport though east of it.  Light did not move nor did not change in intensity or seem to be in a flight plan that I've ever seen as it was too high in the sky and too bright at about 40-50 degrees from the horizon (again because of the dish).  I know that planes do not land or come in from that direction because the commercial airlines come in east overhead and around to the south.  Watched with my brother in-law for about 10 minutes and concluded it could not be an aircraft so I went inside to check online for any other astronomical events taking place as I know Mars has been very close lately and was behind me in the north-eastern sky at the time.  I could see and hear one small aircraft passing in front with noticable red blinking lights.  It's possible it was a helicopter in the distance with a spot light though it never moved for 10 minutes or changed intensity?  Went outside and checked for it 30 minutes later and was gone.   I would like to know if anyone else saw this and reported it. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible aircraft w/ landing light, or a star?  PD));30.3218000000001;-97.3804999999998
