very bright object over Elgin Texas;2006-05-11 23:00:00;15 minutes;very bright object over Elgin Texas I was returning from a business trip in Austin, driving on Hwy 290 east to Houston when I noticed a very bright light to the northeast. I had noticed a large number of planes in the area (I think this was in the approach to the Austin Airport) and at first I thought it was a helicopter as it was much lower (about 30 degrees elevation vs 45+ where the planes were) and it seemed to be hovering over the town of Elgin. It was so bright though I just kept watching it. There was a full moon and it was clear - I could see the strobes and nav lights on the planes clearly but this had none and the light was shifting in color as I watched it. At this point it was probably 5 miles or so away. After 10 minutes I was directly south of it and within a mile. At this point I could see it had no strobes, was alternating between a hover and very tight circles and the light had a color that just didn't look normal. If the planes lights were the size of a pencil the light(s) on this were the size of the pencil itself (a little bigger). I saw several cars pulled over and the people from them standing outside watching the object. When it would circle closer to my car the radar / laser detector in my car would begin alerting every signal type and strength. (I had pulled over at this point and sat in my car watching). I noticed one of the planes in the area begin descending sharply towards the object and realized it was one of a few military jets when it came closer. When it was about a mile or so away the object suddenly dimmed and then it just kind of blinked to a spot 5 miles or so to the north west. It began it's bright light show again and moved off slowly until I couldnt see it anymore.;30.3218000000001;-97.3804999999998
