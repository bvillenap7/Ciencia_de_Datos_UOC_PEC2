ONE OF OUR MEXICAN EMPLOYEES WAS STAYING LATE HELPING MY HUSBAND AT OUR RESTAURANT.  HE IS A VERY QUIET AND CONSERVATIVE PERSON.  WHEN HE WENT OUT TO THE DUMPSTER AT APPROXIMATELY 3 AM HE SAW A ROUND DISK TYPE OBJECT IN THE SKY.  HE WATCHED IT FOR A FEW MINUTES WHILE IT MOVED SLIGHTLY UP/DOWN/SIDEWAYS WITH NO NOISE.  IT THEN MOVED TOWARDS HIM AND STOPPED OVERHEAD.  HE SAID IT WAS ABOUT 100 METERS ABOVE HIS HEAD AND ABOUT 30 METERS IN DIAMETER.  HE SAID IT WAS WHITE FROM LIGHT AND IT WAS SURROUNDED BY WHIT/ORANGE LIGHTS.  THERE WAS A SLIGHT HUMMING OR BUZZING SOUND.  HE THEN RAN INTO THE RESTAURANT WHERE HE DID NOT TELL MY HUSBAND UNTIL HE TOOK HIM HOME AT 5:00 AM.  HE SAID HE WAS VERY SCARED.  MY HUSBAND HAD HIM DRAW THE EVENT OUT SINCE HIS SPANISH IS NOT THE BEST!  WHEN I TALKED TO HIM THE NEXT DAY HE TOLD ME THE SAME STORY.;30.3218000000001;-97.3804999999998
