I was sitting on my window edge just talking to some friends in a call.  My window is on the 2nd floor of the house so a good 20 feet above the ground.  As I was sitting there I saw an object flying off in the distance.  I took my headphones out to see if I could hear any noise from it as it was flying relatively low.  There was no noise coming from it.  The object also emitted blue and red lights and at times white lights.  The first time it came around and moved across the sky it flew really smooth and fast for an airplane which I don't believe it was.  After it flew out of my sight of view I began to keep an eye out.   Around 5 minutes later, it reappeared from the same area.  This time however the blue light stayed on the whole time and the red light it had blinked between bright and dim.  A very subtle detail I saw was that the object seemed to move a little faster whenever the red light was brighter and slowed down when it was dimmed.  The object also was flying si! gnificantly slower the 2nd time it came back as it was in my field of view for a few minutes rather than just one.   The only thing in the areas it went to that it could have checked out were ranches and open land.;33.0031999999999;-96.5433999999995
