White light moving across sky without a streak or sound in different directions.;2010-11-20 03:00:00;1-2 Seconds MAX;White light moving across sky without a streak or sound in different directions. I was driving down FM-544 heading southbound. As I looked into the sky in front of me I noticed what I thought was a shooting star. My personal analysis of this event is as accurate as it gets.  The object was about 100,000 feet above me as I traveled at a speed of 55 MPH.  The object moved eastbound approximately 6-8 miles, or approximately North Garland Rd and George Bush Tollway.  Then it moved a mile westward, or approximately Brand Rd. Then it moved back to North Garland Rd. Finally coming back over my vehicle and disappeared over Lake Ray Hubbard. The incident occured in approximately 1-2 seconds. So using simple math I calculated the craft roughly went 6-8 miles westbound,  Then 1 mile east bound, then another mile westbound, then back 6-8 miles at where it began. 14 miles at the slowest in 1 second.  Thats 50,000 MPH in different directions, without a sound or streak of light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.0031999999999;-96.5433999999995
