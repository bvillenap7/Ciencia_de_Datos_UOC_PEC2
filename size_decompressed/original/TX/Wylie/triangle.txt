My cousin and her boyfriend were on the way home from work at Chili's.  While traveling down the highway she said wow the moon is bright tonight As they got closer the light she soon relized it was not the moon and thought maybe it was a chopper.  Soon they got close enough to relize that it was not a chopper but some kind of triangular craft with 3 lights on each corner and a red light in the center.  This craft was no more than 100-300 feet off the ground and she said the lights were moving all over the ground as if searching for something.  This craft was just above them and to the left over a field.  They could see it clearly above them because he had T-Tops of his vehicle.  She was screaming to drive faster because she knew it was nothing she had ever seen before.  It had no sound and she side it was huge like size of a football field.  When she got home she told knowone until the next day.  She thought about calling the police but did not.  She grew up in a strict Baptist home and these such things just dont happen.  Until that moment...  I have always believed her becuase she is my cousin #1 and she had no reason to lie about it..  I checked on materials on the subject and found that many people thought the moon was bright on first observations of a UFO.  She also spoke to my uncle who was a pilot with a major airline.  He really had nothing to say about it..but a few weeks later unsolved mysteries ran a show about german police officers that tracted a craft across there city.  They had it documented on tape there conversations between all officers.  The craft they showed on the TV show is exactly what she said she had seen.;33.0031999999999;-96.5433999999995
Pyramid-shaped craft with pulsating light seen emitting red flare.;2004-12-01 23:00:00;5 minutes;Pyramid-shaped craft with pulsating light seen emitting red flare. First viewed as a large light. Very bright and changing from blue to red and occasionally white in a pulsating manner. The object remained stationary for approximately two minutes and then began moving south. At this pointI began to move in order to better view the object. The light then grew dim and I realized that it posessed the shape of a pyramid. It slowed down and began to move up and down very slowly. I noticed a reddish flare shoot out of the top at which time the craft jetted down even lower. The light at this point had become nearly undetectable, however I could still view the shape and relative size of said object. It eventually left our field of vision and I rejoined the rest of the witnesses. I asked what one of them who had seen it and his description matched mine perfectly. All of the others agreed on the events that had taken place. Afterwards we noticed around seven planes and helicopters in the area, while before the sighting there were none.;33.0031999999999;-96.5433999999995
Large triangle over head, white lights in corners, big and fast.;2013-05-05 21:30:00;30-45 seconds;Large triangle over head, white lights in corners, big and fast. My father and I were coming out of our truck to go inside when I looked above us and saw a large, black, and triangular object flying above us slowly.  It was relatively large but high in the sky, probably 4-5 moons could fit in the space.  The object had 3 bright, white lights at each corner of the craft and was flying relatively fast and had a jet like sound, the craft exited horizon over houses.
