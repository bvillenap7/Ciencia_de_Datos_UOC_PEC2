A ghostly, lumiscent object darts over car on Texas highway.;2001-02-11 01:30:00;A second;A ghostly, lumiscent object darts over car on Texas highway. I'm a 27 yr. old male and my 22 yr old female companion were driving back from Texarkana late at night when,just for an instant, we saw a luminescent form fly above the car.It's really hard to describe.There wasn't really a shape to it, but it just seemed to flit above the car.It was approx. 5-10 ft above the car and after we passed under it I looked behind us and saw nothing.I do not know if this was because it was reflecting the light from the headlights when it went over or what.It didn't have any arms or wings.It didn't have any lights.The only thing I can compare it to is a ghost, but it didn't have a head or eyes though.;33.1734;-94.9688000000001
