I own a ranch and I have game cameras on it.  In a remote location.  I started noticing that the cameras were capturing unusual flying phenomenon's.  So I put multiple cameras in that area.  I have captured a significant number of images that nobody can explain. I am hopeful that you will be able to.  This camera has the correct date and time.;33.1734;-94.9688000000001
