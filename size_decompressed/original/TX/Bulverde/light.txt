Green Light fell straight down to Earth in about 2 seconds just north of San Antonio, TX.;2009-08-06 21:50:00;2 seconds;Green Light fell straight down to Earth in about 2 seconds just north of San Antonio, TX. My son & I were driving home on Hwy 46 going eastbound towards Hwy 281 & saw a green light fall quickly from the sky.  Total fall time was approx. 2 seconds.  It fell straight down to Earth & did not shoot across the sky like a shooting star.  I have never witnessed anything like this before & just want to have this incident recorded.  I have no idea what this was.;29.7767;-98.4625999999999
