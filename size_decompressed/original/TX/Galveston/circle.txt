I then looked up to my left and could see an circular object moving very slowly along the coastline (North to South).  It flew almost over us.  I'm not sure how low, but it was much lower than the aircraft coming into the airport in Galveston.   The other weird thing is that it made no noise at all, and we could clearly hear the smaller single engine planes when they came in. This object had no lights but we could see because the night sky was clear and the moon was out. We wathced until it was out of sight.;29.2851973913044;-94.8202939130436
Large metallic object hovering over galveston bay;2005-08-02 00:00:00;5 minutes;Large metallic object hovering over galveston bay Me and my ex-wife were in Galveston vacationing.  It was around 12am and a few clouds where in the sky. We went to the 2nd floor balcony.  We looked up in the sky and saw a blinking light.  At first we thought maybe it was the space shuttle or the space station. We knew it was not any type of aircraft it was to far up to be anything other than a planet or something else.  We continued to watch it for a few minutes trying to figure out what it was.  When we looked over the bay there was a light cloud bank at the time.  Clouds were blocking out the moon light so it was sporadic at times.  And there it was the clouds moved out and the moon light hit a large circular object.  It had a dome on top and below the dome appeared to be what looked like some sort of exhaust ports.  Could not tell what was underneath other than something was protruding from there.  It couldnâ€™t have been more than 100yds from us. You could actually see how smooth the service.  It lasted maybe 30 se! conds the clouds rolled back in and it was gone.  And while this was going on the light was still blinking in the sky and when the object left the light stopped at the same time.  We went inside thinking what the hell just happened.  Neither of us could sleep and ended up staying up most of the night.;29.2851973913044;-94.8202939130436

At first I thought it was a plane come at us, but it was not.  No red or green lights.  Bright white only.   Moved across the sky very quickly from SW to NE.  Have tracked many satellites across the sky and this was not a satellite unless it was EXTREMELY low.   Light was bright like a helicopter, or like I stated previously, a plane coming directly at you. It could not be - no starboard or port lights and it moved acoss the sky with the light very bright and the same strength.;29.2851973913044;-94.8202939130436
