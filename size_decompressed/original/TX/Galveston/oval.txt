While observing a satellite overhead a bright oval white light appreared  to direct South a hands width above the horizon over the Gulf of Mexico.  The light approached slowly to the N. toward witness.  Wind was from South about 5 to 10mph.   No sound was heard and object continued to increase in size to size approx of a BB at narms length.  Object's brightness was just short of that Venus.   Object slowly turned to the NNE over the 3 1/2 minutes of observation.  I took 6 photo's at 10x with a 12.0 megapixel Nikon digital camera. I am submitting photo's.  Object when magnified appeares to have reddish/pinkish light and has some sort of field effect and a shape like a cigar maybe made out in inner glow.;29.2851973913044;-94.8202939130436
Bright whiite round lite , low to ground and falling. Thought it was a helcopter that went into the bay.;2012-11-24 21:30:00;30 seconds;Bright whiite round lite , low to ground and falling. Thought it was a helcopter that went into the bay. Driving northwest in residential area at 9:30 P.M. a very bright, white light, round in shape, caught my eye.  Located in sky direstly above, and seemingly a few hundred feet above the ground.  It was moving very fast and desending downward.  I stopped my car and watched.  I thought it had to be a helicopter going down.  I feared it would hit the houses at the back of the neighborhood. I waited for the firey crash, it did not come... I figured the object must have hit the bay instead.  I prceeded to drive 2 blocks home.  I ran inside to the news, and looked outside for emergency responders.  Nothing. Havent found any reports about it either. Disturbing.;29.2851973913044;-94.8202939130436
Large Hot Pink/Red  very low and slow orbs over West end of West Bay.  7 seen in total;2015-04-25 21:45:00;20 minutes;Large Hot Pink/Red very low and slow orbs over West end of West Bay.  7 seen in total. Saturday night looking to the West from beach house located at Terramar Beach I with two friends witnessed 3 large slow moving hot pink/red orbs in a following formation over West Bay.  The orbs had an intense color of hot pink/red and appeared a little smaller than a BB held at arms length.  Orbs were three fingers above the horizon, quite low when first seen with the middle orb higher than the front and following orb.  Orbs moved from west to east along the bay then turned over the bay toward the mainland.  Leading orb did not appear after it's view was blocked by a house.  Higher orbs continued across West Bay and faded out. 5 min in view.  10 minutes a second formation appeared just like the first but now 4 orbs were in a right to left very low trailing formation.  The lower orbs were blocked by a house others turned and faded out.  Viewed thru 10x23 mm binoculars, orbs were ALL LIGHT and SOLID in tight focus.  3 photo's taken.;29.2851973913044;-94.8202939130436
