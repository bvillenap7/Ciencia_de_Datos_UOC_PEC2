Previous Stealth sighting in Williamsburg area;1994-06-04 10:00:00;a few seconds;Previous Stealth sighting in Williamsburg area I'm just submitting this because it bears on the 11/1/02 sighting near Williamsburg posted on the website. We were visiting Berkeley Plantation near Williamsburg in June 1994, and I looked up and saw what I'm sure was a Stealth bomber. It looked just like the pictures - black and triangular. I never regarded it as a UFO sighting since we were near military bases and I was very sure that it was a military aircraft that I saw. I don't remember it making a sound that I could hear, but it was flying pretty high so that's not surprising. ((NUFORC Note:  The B-2 Stealth bomber is very loud, when it is flying at a high power/thrust level.  However, at a distance, it might be audibly undetectable.  We have no way of knowing whether the event is in any way related to the 11/01/02 event.  PD));29.2851973913044;-94.8202939130436

Traingular set of 3 lights in the sky where no star formation of that nature theprevious nights.;2012-07-04 21:00:00;5 minutes;traingular set of 3 lights in the sky where no star formation of that nature theprevious nights. First let me say that my first impression was that they were stars in the sky.  The problem with that scenario is that there are no trangular formation of stars in the western sky over Galveston at that time.  They did not seem to be moving yet I went ahead and took a few pictures. I basically forgot about the incident thinking that they were stars until just today I downloaded the pictures along with others to make a movie of my daughter coming down a 20 story building on the outside as a benefit for special olympics. The pictures seem to imply something other than stars.  I can send the pictures to you if requested. I checked sightings on July 4th and there was one in Houston referring to three lights passing over. Houston is 50 miles north of Galveston.

Triangular craft with colorful lights under the UFO.;2015-08-08 21:00:00;5 minutes;Triangular craft with colorful lights under the UFO. The triangular box craft was hovering over the shoreline where there were many families with cars parked on the beach.  It had very colorful lines of lights that would sequence off and on under the craft. I took the video from my car sunroof, as I was fascinated, but scared to get as close as cars parked on beach.  The craft was at a standstill to the naked eye, but on my video it is moving in all directions. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
