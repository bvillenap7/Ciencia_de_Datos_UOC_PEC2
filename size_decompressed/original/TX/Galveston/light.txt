Starting on October 10, 2004, I have seen an obj. in the sky twice.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus may be one of the objects.  PD));2004-10-13 01:25:00;30 mins;Starting on October 10, 2004, I have seen an object in the sky twice previously in the past week and a third time last night, I saw two. Usually I noticed it around 2 or 2:15 am (while I was working at my home computer, I am a writer and so is my husband) and it would be noticable for about 30 to 45 minutes but since it was early in the morning I have usually gone to bed before it disappeared. However, on Monday night 10/12 it disappeared before I went to bed.  I might add the weather was good and no other stars were visible in the sky when we have seen these lights. After the first sighting, my husband up out of bed to see it/them. The object(s) appears on the Gulf water side due East and Southeast over the Bolivar Peninsul/ Texas City area.  You see a belt of lights parallel to the horizon seeming to rotate around whatever it is, changing colors from white to yellow to green occasionally with a red flash.  Normally it hovers in one spot moving ever so slightly but last night 2 of them appeared at the same time. At first they were a good distance from each other then one moved to be in tandem with the most easterly one and they were close to each other high over the roof top of my neighbors home but I have no idea how high they were, I would say extremely high.  On Monday night the one that was there was kind od darting around slightly before it disappeared. I am concerned and I do not know what to do because as you may know there are many petroleum refineries here in this area and the salt dome oil storage is underground at High Island not far from here. I guess I am worried these might be some sort of spy vehicles but they just seem so unusual that I cannot believe others have not seen them and I have to think the US military and the Coast Guard would be strengently guarding these refineries, so why have they not seen them? We tried to get some photos but our camera is not good enough for this type photograpy.  We do have a telescope and we are going to adjust it today so we can possibly see something in the next few days. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus may be the object.

I was standing on my friend's balcony looking towards the beach and I noticed two bright stars in the sky..my friend said, Those are planes!  But they made NO noise, and did not move position!   I watched them for a few seconds, they got a tiny bit bigger, (still no sound) then they completely vanished without moving!  They were there, then they just weren't there!

It looked like a star, but as we kept looking at it, it flashed again!   It didn't move but flashed about 3 more times, faded with each flash, then it winked out completely!

Bright white light viewed from 1 mile for 3 min. with 20x100mm binoculars which passed overhead/no noise.;2011-08-12 21:00:00;3 min.;Bright white light viewed from 1 mile for 3 min. with 20x100mm binoculars which passed overhead/no noise. At 21:00 hrs Aug 12 on clear night  I and a friend witnessed a bright white light appear to the West end in middle of Galveston by San Louis pass low down in sky at hands bredth above horizon and continue in a straight line from W. end of Island going length of Island. The object continued in a straight line West to East and passed under the full moon which was directly over Gulf of Mexico at that time.  The light went above and in front of witnesses toward Gulf. The bright light was the size of a BB heald at arms length ad as luminous as the landing lights of a jet airliner.  This light was observed by myself with a 20x100 mm astronomical binoculars during the event. At no time was a sound heard and the wind was from the South at 20 mph the light passed overhead to windward of witnesses. No other features were seen at any time comming ,overhead or behind except a bright white oval shaped light. After figuring angle of light when it passed by overhead from 1 mil! e width of Island at this point, which is 16 miles W of West end of The Galveston Seawall, the light was apoximatly 5000ft high and traveled 8 miles in 180 seconds or 3 min.  Speed would of been approx. 220mph. In 20x100mm binoculars the light was as wide as an eraser on a #2 pencil at arms length.  From a mile away I estimate light appeared at least 50 ft. in diameter if not more.;29.2851973913044;-94.8202939130436
On Aug, 26, a bright, silvery-white light was observed it appeared and disappeared three times in the due east at about 60-65 degrees.;2011-08-26 20:30:00;30 seconds;On Aug, 26, a bright, silvery-white light was observed it appeared and disappeared three times in the due east at about 60-65 degrees. On Friday, August 26th, 2011, at about 20:30 hrs, standing on the deck of a friends' beach home on the West end,  I witnessed a large white light appear and disappear three times, at precisely equal intervals. It was a large, silvery-white light that appeared for about 2-3 seconds, disappeared for about 10-12 seconds, reappeared and disappeared again, and reappeared a third time for 2-3 seconds, then disappeared again.  We continued our vigil for about an hour after the third sighting, but did not observe any further sightings of the object. The near-dark sky was absolutely clear, there was a southerly breeze, and the object was about 60-65 degrees off the horizon at a nearly due east location.  It was very slightly horizontally oval and about the size of an English pea held at arm's length.  It was as bright and luminous as a vehicle head lamp with no observable structure in or around the object no sounds whatsoever were heard emanating from the object. A friend on the deck with me observed the final 2-3 second interval and confirmed the sighting was indeed an anomalous bright silvery-white light, inexplicable in origin, with no sounds associated with the sighting. He called a friend about 40 miles inland and she stated that she saw the same consecutive trio of lights that I saw and was able to confirm that the sighting was at about 60-65 degrees and at a nearly due east location. From this same location a sighting was reported to the N.U.F.O.R.C. on August 12, 2100.;29.2851973913044;-94.8202939130436
