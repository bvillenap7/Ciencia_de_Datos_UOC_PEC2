Orange Craft Seen Over Galveston Bay;2010-05-22 23:45:00;2min;Orange Craft Seen Over Galveston Bay On Saturday May 22, 2010 at approximately 11:45pm-12:00am timeframe, my husband and I were fishing on the West End of Galveston, TX on a private pier located in the Jamaica Beach area.  If you looked across the bay, you could see the Texas City Refinery Plant on the other side. As I was walking to use the ladies room in the parking lot, I looked over the bay and saw what I thought was a fire trailing up towards his side.  I called out to him to look above his head and tell me if he saw the fire. I thought at first it was a bag blowing upwards with a fire inside (like the kind used at a Thai wedding or something).  It was so windy that night I knew that had to be ridiculous, so I called out to see if he saw it too. My husband and two others, fishing at the end of the pier saw the orange glowing object as well. It looked like a dark object with a series of bright orange lights on the side.  I do not want to make an observation on the shape of it because all I could tell was that it seemed to be an object and I could only see what I thought looked like a half moon set of lights. It floated left to right (from my vantage point), hovered for a few moments and then faded from bright orange to nothing.  Total duration seemed to be approximately 60-90 seconds total before fading out.;29.2851973913044;-94.8202939130436
