At Terrimar Beach on West end of Galveston Island at 8 10 pm I was searching sky due West using 10x23mm binnoculers and while observing a kite flying due west an lighted sphere crossed behind the kite across a 20 mph South wind proceding West to East.  The object and kite were 1500ft away and the lighted object resembled a Beach ball as it had vertical light and dark pannels.   There was an Orange light emanating from INSIDE the sphere. Sphere was not all illuminated just the orange light from inside.   I took eyes off object for  5 seconds to retrieve my camera from my pocket.   Looked up and only the kite was visible.  Went behind the house to search entire NW sky and did not regain object.  Object was moving about 5 mph as it passed behind the kite.;29.2851973913044;-94.8202939130436
