The object was black and mostly rectangular in shape.  One of the top corners was a little irregular in shape. It was black but almost seemed transparent  as if you could see through it slightly.  It was off to the east over Galveston bay heading north towards Texas city or Baytown.  It was pretty huge, i would guess 100 to 200 feet long and 50 to 75 feet tall.  It was really strange and I felt very weird looking at it, almost felt like I was not supposed to.  I wondered if anyone one else was witnessing it too, there was the usual large amount of traffic on the bridge  i couldn't have been the only one seeing it.  I didn't think to try and take pictures of it until I was off the freeway and on Harborside drive,  i did get a few pictures of it but it was already moving away from me and harder to see.;29.2851973913044;-94.8202939130436
