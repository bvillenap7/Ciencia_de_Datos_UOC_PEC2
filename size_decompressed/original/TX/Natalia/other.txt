My estimate for distance from me would be about one air mile. At this distance the size of the bank of lights was about one finger(horizontally). I couldnt make out a shape behind the lights but it did have a kind of rectangular shadow behind the lights. I was out there for ten minutes and it stayed in the same place.. the lights kept changing colors and occasionally some would go dar then light back up again and start changing colors. I finally came inside because I got cold and next time I went out about 11:45p.m.  It was gone. This is the second time in 6 months that I have seen this same type object.;29.2134;-98.8579
