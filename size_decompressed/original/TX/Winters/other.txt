Airplanes with silent engines?;2008-04-03 23:00:00;<1 minute;Airplanes with silent engines? April 3, about 11:00 PM over the skies of Winters, TX. I looked up and saw a flashing red light as any airplane would have. This object was in the shape of a large sized normal airplane. It was flying rather low... not more than a couple thousand feet elevation. It was also going rather fast. I thought it may have been traveling faster than the speed of sound so I waited a moment for the sound to pass, but I never heard any noise. This plane was silent. I'm curious if it might be a new experimental technology. A friend that lives about 6 blocks away also saw it and described it in the same manner, before I ever mentioned it to him.;31.9585;-99.9469
