3-amber colored ovals in Winters, Tx sky.;2011-03-10 20:00:00;12 seconds;3-amber colored ovals in Winters, Tx sky. My Grandmother and I were driving back from a roping in Winters, Tx on March 10, 2011 at 8:36, to be precise. And my grandma said, Son, look at those lights.   I looked and there was two amber colored, ovals in the sky.  They sat there for approximate seven seconds, and then they slowly disappeared.  As those disappeared then another one just like the other two lighted up behind them, then it sat there for about six seconds, then it disappeared as well.;31.9585;-99.9469
