moch plane;1993-08-25 01:00:00;30 min;moch plane my sighting occured at night and at a distance so i did not see much detail just lights. i saw what i believed to be a jet or plane of some kind because of the pattern and color of the lights. one large white light with two smaller red lights on each side much like an air plane. what made my sighting wierd is that the plane stoped and seemed to hover making no sound, then the two red lights detached from the main light and seemed to make a controlled landing on the ground with each red light going its on way. i believe the two red lights were some sort of probes.
