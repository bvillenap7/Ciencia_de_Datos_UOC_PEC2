This is the second sighting by my step daughter.  She and several of her family members saw one of the dayliight perfect circles in a cloud like the one on the web from Nashville, Tenn.  That one appeared over Dallas, Texas at about the same time and I was witness to it.  I watched it for over ten minutes while driving down a heavily congested street called Northwest Highway and no amount of gesturing could make anyone whose eye I could catch look up.  Nothing on the news of course.  Back to the Wilmer night sighting.  I am not sure what time she told me it was, but the reason it caught her eye, was that it looked like a black hole in the sky.  It blocked out all the stars in a huge circle.  No lights, just a black hole.  Since she was driving and couldn't watch it intently, she does not know how it dissappeared.  In the field below it asks me to submit to a collect call.  I don't want to do that but exchanging emails would be acceptable.  I think you can research Popular Mechanics or Mechanics Illustrated back to the late fifties or early sixties and find information on an arc welder that defied gravity.  It was for sell at the time.;32.599;-96.6768
