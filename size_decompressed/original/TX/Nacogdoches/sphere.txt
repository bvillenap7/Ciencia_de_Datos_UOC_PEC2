July 18, 2017. 9:25 P.M. Last night after having a fun time of dinner and conversation with 2 of my friends I headed home.  It was 9:25 PM, when I slowed to make a 90 degree turn onto the road where my house is.  I happened to look up into the sky, a very clear space above the road at that point with no trees blocking the view, and there were no clouds, and as I gazed briefly, I slammed on the brakes (I was only doing about 25 mph to turn) because a star like bright light just popped into existence.  It looked like a magical appearance. All of this happened very quickly, and I thought, “Hell it’s them!” but then I thought “maybe it’s a comet, or a shooting star?  But it was sitting still, and it had no tail.   Then after about half a second it shot across the sky, and to me it looked like it moved 6 feet, which of course was much more than six feet, and then it just disappeared!  No tail, no sound, and it didn’t dip down, it moved completely in a horizontal line parallel to the earth. So in about 2 or 3 seconds, it appeared, stayed there a second, then shot across the sky and instantly vanished.  It didn’t disappear behind clouds or trees. It was in wide open sky. This morning I found no marks, punctures, or bruises, so apparently they did not visit me.;31.6633842696629;-94.6237943820225
