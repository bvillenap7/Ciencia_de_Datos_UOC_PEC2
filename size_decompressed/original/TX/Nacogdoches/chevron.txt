Grey V shaped object flying with a low hum - Shorted out stoplights and lights;2007-10-28 21:30:00;Brief;Grey V shaped object flying with a low hum - Shorted out stoplights and lights On October 28, 2007 in Nacogdoches, Texas four of us witnessed an unidentifiable object around 9:30pm (21:30) fly between two grey clouds.  There were bright grey clouds outlined by a dark sky behind it. Me and two of my fraternity brothers were just coming out of a meeting and heard a low hum growing louder and closer.  All of us looked up expecting to see an incoming plane way off in the distance but in between two grey clouds there was about a 100 yard gap of black sky clearly outlined by the clouds (directly above us).  Then we saw a “V” shaped object with a smooth rounded bottom the same color as the clouds traveling south at a pretty high rate of speed.  It looked about as large as a passenger plane does from that high up.  It looked almost like a grey hang glider with a very low hum sound being emitted.  After we stopped and talked about what we just saw, we went home and every stop light on North Street was not on, not even the emergency blinking lights and there were police regulating traffic (Other peoples power may have gone off too, it was about 10pm and I saw no lights on the way home).  Anyways the people who saw the air-craft are all college students at Stephen F. Austin State University and in a Fraternity.  We would not make this up.  The only reason I am reporting this is because I saw that a few other people have seen a similar thing and there could be more than just in Texas.  OBJECT DESCRIPTION Grey “V” shaped Hang Glider object with a smooth curved bottom followed by a low hum and power outages of a bunch of stop lights (Not even the backup flashing lights).;31.6633842696629;-94.6237943820225
