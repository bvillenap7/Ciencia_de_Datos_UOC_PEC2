White light appears over clear Texas sky?;2008-05-02 04:00:00;10 minutes;White light appears over clear Texas sky? 3 of my friends and I were smoking cigarettes on the outside porch of his home in  northern Nacogdoches, Texas - 4:00 AM Central Time Zone. I was amazed of how clear the night’s sky was, and also how well you could see stars.  I started to focus my attention at the brightest star in sky. I stared at it for about 15 seconds pondering if it were in-fact the north star, then realized it was more eastern.  At about that moment of realization, the frozen star-like light started slightly moving to west in a straight but slow motion. I started yelling at the other 3 people outside with me, and pointed out the moving (non-blinking) bright white sphere of light. We all had a sudden rush shoot through our body’s once we had all realized we’d never seen anything like this before. No one said a word, just mumbled slowly stuff like oohhhhhhhhh! or whattttttt! (I could tell that everyone was truly freaked out.) The light started speeding up gradually while swerving slight zigzags in the sky. About 2 minutes into  seeing this object pass across about 3/4s of the visible sky , it suddenly disappears.  We instantly ran across the house to front yard to see if we could still see anything from a different angle.  Around 45 seconds after seeing the light go out/disappear we all 4 see a super bright shooting star looking thing with a long bright tail zoom across the whole sky(diameter about- 8 gauge). While these events were going on, flashing lights like lightning were striking about every 10-15 seconds and no one saw any actual lightning, nor heard any thunder, we just saw light flashes in the distance.  I’m not too sure if that has anything to do with the light object we saw, but it could perhaps.  This is the 3rd time I have seen unexplained UFO objects with more than just myself viewing, but my 4th time to ever see these floating lights in Nacogdoches within a year and a half. Every time they have been about the same, my first 2 sightings the light was 100% bigger and seemed more of a blue-ish white light- and my latest 2 encounters I’ve been seeing a more white based light circle about the size of a lower-case o (size 12 font).  I’m just looking for a possible explanation for what I’ve been seeing, or if anyone else has seen the same things that 7 of my friends and I truthfully saw. Thanks for your time.;31.6633842696629;-94.6237943820225

Three separate lights witnessed within 15 minutes in East Texas.;2014-10-29 19:30:00;15 minutes;Three separate lights witnessed within 15 minutes in East Texas. While standing outside with a friend of mine discussing current events we noticed a light traveling from West to East at a fairly slow pace which I would compare to that of a light aircraft. We were able to watch this object move into our view field which was blocked by a tree line to the west, go overhead and over another tree line to the east. This light was a white light that at one point had gotten bright, and then dimmed back down to its normal bright glow.  This caught my eye because I see aircraft nightly when I go outside and look at the stars and this object did not have any strobe lights. This was a solid light which I exclaimed to my friend was a rare event that I had never seen before. My friend was telling me how he thought that this vehicle was an airplane 747 or some object that had a bright light on it. Moments later while giving my viewpoints on how that couldn't be a 747, we watched as a second craft flew towards us from the sam! e western direction. I quickly pointed to the craft and said Look another one. We watched as this craft started approaching from the west and without a gradual turn the object changed direction without missing a beat or stopping and started heading South West. This second object was starting to head southwest out of our view field so my buddy and I walked towards the street that I live on so I could get a better view of where the craft was going and what it was. This craft traveled South West for maybe 10-15 seconds maximum and then seamlessly changed directions to moving in a South Eastern direction. The light continued to move Southeast until we lose site of the object over houses that blocked the horizon. At this point in time our eyes are plastered to the sky and we are comparing this light we witnessed with other obvious aircraft lights in the sky. By now we are searching for another object to appear from the west when directly above us another light pops i! nto view not coming from any direction but seemingly coming &q! uotDown  into view and then starts heading what I would call directly South. This 3rd object we could only keep in our view for 30 seconds or so max before it was behind a treeline. All three of these objects were simply bright white lights that I would estimate to have been approx 10-15x the size of the North Star for perspective. I would estimate that the first two objects flew way under planes we were watching in the sky while the 3rd object was obviously much higher and a slightly smaller light. While this was happening the dogs in the area were very amp'd up and going nuts barking and when they passed a good distance from being directly overhead the dogs stopped barking. This happened on the first two craft while the third craft I do not recall if this happened.  All three of these separate sighting happened within 15 minutes of eachother and I must say that I really do feel honored to get to have seen this. The third craft was really the one that got my buddy because his airplane theory went out the window when it appeared out of nowhere directly above the top of us and I mean directly.;31.6633842696629;-94.6237943820225
Two white lights slowly moved apart, and then faded away.;2014-11-18 18:45:00;30 seconds;Two white lights slowly moved apart, and then faded away. My girlfriend told me to come outside and look at two weird looking stars she had never noticed.  I saw two white lights that appeared to be normal stars in the northeast sky.   The lights slowly began to move apart and then over a period of about 30 seconds completely faded away.   They were very bright white and slowly dimmed to white-ish blue.   They were not blinking or flickering. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));31.6633842696629;-94.6237943820225
Flying lights over Nacogdoches, TX.;2015-03-14 16:32:00;8 minutes;Flying lights over Nacogdoches,  TX My neighbors from 2 separate houses, my children, partner and myself watched as just over the trees 3 sets of lights came through.  One flew ahead of the other two.  One back tracked the other one just froze in the air.   Then they all carried in as another set of 2 came around, then another, again and again till 1 had passed by.  They would eventually wrap around together til they were in a group and then vanish individually.   It was really interesting.   We called the sheriff's department but they insisted there were no scheduled flights near by at all which again makes us even more curious.;31.6633842696629;-94.6237943820225
