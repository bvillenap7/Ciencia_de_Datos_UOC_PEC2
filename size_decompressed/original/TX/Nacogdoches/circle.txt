Large red circle flies West Direction to Home;2008-06-13 01:30:00;5 minutes;Large red circle flies West Direction to Home On way home from work at 1 a.m. driving in a west direction, huge red light in sky.  I thought it might be the harvest moon, but realized was in wrong, considering the moon was behind me.  Deep red color, about size of the moon, slightly larger.  Moved right to left, slowly faded like being behind cloud, no clouds in sky.  Disappeared after going over hill, then returned brighter before turning south.  Got out of my car at house, and walked around yard to see if I could find it again, but it was gone.  Basic duration of 5 minutes.
