My wife was driving and I was riding shotgun, with our 2 kids in the back.  Just North of Nacogdoches my wife said look at that!  Directly in front of us was a greenish object falling from the sky.  What I saw was a very bright green fireball type thing with a short tail.  It only lasted 3 to 5 seconds.  My wife thought someone had shot a bottle rocket or some other type of firework over US 59, the road we were driving South on.  I thought it was a meteor or possibly some sort of space trash falling back through the atmosphere(I had the raren privilege of seeing a Russian booster fall back to Earth in the 1980's as it entered the atmosphere over Ohio, and I could see this very clearly and brightly in Houston, hundreds of miles away-in fact I thought that was fireworks only a mile or two away and I was shocked and thrilled when I read the next day what I really saw!) I am not 100% sure of the time we saw the fireball, or the county or zip code as we were just passing through the area.  It did appear to be very low in the sky, right in front of the car (toward the South) a very bright firework looking object.  We thought it was very close to us.  We have seen many shooting stars and this was much brighter than those, and also larger looking.;31.6633842696629;-94.6237943820225
