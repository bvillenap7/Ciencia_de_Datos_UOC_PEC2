Chevron object later observed to be an oval shape with lights all around;2020-01-03 05:45:00;2 hours;Chevron object later observed to be an oval shape with lights all around Originally seen around January 3, 2020 but witness the same object every morning in the sky.  It moves up higher in the sky after about an hour.  Orignally looked like a chevron but in days following I was able to see the object as an oval shape with lights all around and a green light running all around the white lights.  Today is January 8, 2020 and I witnessed this again from 5:30 a.m. until 6:45 a.m.;32.7403;-101.9551
