Craft moving at a high rate of speed was quickly changing directions and then vanished.;1999-04-03 23:16:00;2 minutes;A craft moving at a high rate of speed was quickly changing directions and then vanished. As a frined and I were travelling south on FM 78 in Converse, we happened upon an array of ligths, 3-4 red and about the same number of white lights.  At first, it looked as if it were a plane or helicopter with fog ligths on, but the way that the lights were moving suggested something else.  Th fog lights went around, searching, in a cricular motion.  As the craft was doing this, it seemed to be travelling upward, at a high speed.  Then, all of a sudden, it changed directions and headed in a southwestern direction, then dissapeared.;29.5211;-98.3293
bright light vanishes like nothing at a fast speed;2019-04-09 20:45:00;~15 seconds;bright light vanishes like nothing at a fast speed I was playing soccer with my sister.  It was getting dark so we decided to start heading home.  But first i had to change my shoes.  I sit down at a bench & i look up at the sky.  As im looking I see a bright light.  I didnt think much of it, like “oh its just a star”.  Then it flashed & it literally like zoomed so fast & just vanished.  Completely disappeared out of no where.  As it was about to disappear, the speed was just fast.;29.5211;-98.3293
