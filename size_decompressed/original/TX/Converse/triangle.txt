Triangle shaped object seen near Randolph AFB;2003-09-10 05:30:00;20 seconds;Triangle shaped object seen near Randolph AFB This is the second time since the 4th of July I have seen somehting strange in the sky. I posted about another sighting at Randolph AFB on the 5th of July. This time I saw somehting totaly different. I was on my way to the gym at around 05:30 on the 10th of September. I was at a stop light on Kitty Hawk rd. when I saw what appeared at first to be a plane flying very low about 500 ft over the top of a normal size tree. This wouldnt be that unusual since there is an Air Force Base but I have never seen planes landing or even flying that early in the morning since all the planes on the base are training planes. The object had 3 very bright white lights on it in a triangle shape. The lights turned like warning lights on emergency vehicles. I could not see the object itself because the lights were very bright and it was still dark out. I have never seen any lights like these before on any aircraft and I have been around planes for the last 6.5 years, and I have seen almost every type of plane when I was stationed at Nellis AFB. Also there was no sound coming from the object. The object was moving towards the South East very slowly. I watched the object for about 20 seconds and as I got onto 1604 South I lost it in the low clouds. All I know is it was very strange and I have never seen anything like it before ((NUFORC Note:  One of several seemingly credible reports from the same individual, who describes himself as being a member of the U. S. Military.  PD));29.5211;-98.3293
