4 sudden bursts of light in the sky each in a different area.;2014-05-21 09:15:00;~1 minute;4 sudden bursts of light in the sky each in a different area. I was outside playing with my dog with a laser when at the corner of my eye I say a flash of a white light on my left I twisted my head to look.  I thought it was a plane, but it did not flash again.   Then another flash was at the other corner of my eye to the right. I looked suddenly that way but it then went away.   I started searching intently in the sky for another light then bam!  I saw a third light rite in the middle of the sky.  I knew then what ever was making these flashes was not a plane. I ran inside to look for my phone and ran back out side bringing the laser with me just in case they were trying to talk to my laser (I know weird idea but didn't want to take the chance).  Using my phone camera i recorded the sky but right when the last light lit up it was off camera by the time i pointed to it, it was gone. I hope I'm not the only one who saw these things in the sky.   People say it must have been a drone or something the government made. I know what i saw n i don't want to feel crazy.;29.5211;-98.3293
