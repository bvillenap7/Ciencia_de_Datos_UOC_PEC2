I walked off the porch to get a better look because it was traveling so fast, which seemed strange.  It seemed to be two or three miles to the west, and still heading west very quickly.  Then it appeared to stop completely.  A couple of seconds later it very quickly accelerated upward and to the north, and was gone.;35.6669;-101.3963
