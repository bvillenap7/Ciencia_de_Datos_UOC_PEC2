300-400 foot boomerang-shaped object moving at 200 mph ?, one-half mile distant at about 2,000 ft altitude.  Clear skies, daytime.;1983-06-15 17:30:00;1 minute;300-400 foot boomerang-shaped object moving at 200 mph?, one-half mile distant at about 2,000 ft altitude.  Clear skies, daytime. This sighting occurred in June 1983 in Borger, Texas.  I had not reported this earlier because at the time it occurred I had no corroborating witnesses, no photographs, essentially nothing to substantiate the claim.  I doubted that anyone would have believed what I saw at the time.  However, this sighting stays in the back of my mind, so I am reporting it, if for no other reason, than to have closure. The sighting occurred about 17:30 (Local Time, Central Time Zone) in June 1983.  I was in my residence and heard what I thought was a really, really, loud jet.  It was so loud that I stepped out on my front porch to see what it was.  I looked up and the object was probably one-half mile away at an altitude of probably two thousand feet.  (These are only estimations.)   It was huge. I had a pair of 10 X 35 binoculars in the living room, so I quickly stepped back inside and grabbed the binoculars.  By that time the object was receding, so I might have been better off not using the binoculars.  I remember the object filled the binocular’s field of view, which at the time made me wonder just how big this thing actually was. What I saw was a large black boomerang-shaped object, moving from east to west.  It was travelling at a modest speed, maybe 200 miles per hour (again, it’s hard to estimate something in the sky without reference points.)  I remember as I looked at the object, there were three specific things that struck me.  The first was the size…I can only guess that it was 300-400 feet side-to-side and maybe 75-125 feet front-to-back.  The second was the tremendous noise the object made.  It was LOUD.  And, third, the fact that the object was lopsided that is to say it was asymmetrical.  I wondered how it stayed in the air…it didn’t look aerodynamic. I think another reason I never reported this is the fact that it sounded like a really large jet.  Maybe it was…if so, it was like nothing I had seen before and have not seen since.  The jet sound made me think it was a conventional aircraft, but the shape and the size made me think it was something beyond classification. I did not notice any exhaust or smoke behind the craft. Since then I have seen video of the A1 bomber and other stealth aircraft.  On one occasion I saw an A1 pass directly overhead.  Believe me, the thing I saw in 1983 makes the A1 look like a toy. By definition, what I saw was a UFO, because it was not identified, it was flying and it was an object.  Whether it was of terrestrial origin or somewhere else, I don’t know  I wish I did.

Boomerang object, no sound;2003-12-23 01:40:00;5 sec.;Boomerang object, no sound I was watching the night sky to the west at about 1:40 in the mouring when I saw an object coming in from the North. I looked down then looked back to where I thought I had seen something and caught it just before it faded out. It was moving quit fast and I tracked it across the night sky to where it might it end up and it faded back into view. I got a chance to see this object that was boommerang shaped, the lights or glow was only lit about the same as the night stars. It was moving North to South very quickly, it faded out once again and I tracked it across the sky to where it might end with its speed and it faded back into view just before I lost it over a well lit area. It seemed to be maybe 50,000 feet up and the size of a finger when you put your hand up to the night sky. Very large object with no sound.;35.6669;-101.3963
