It was the same size of a star but it couldn't be a shooting star because it kept lite and did not have any form of fire or have a tail.  It could not be a plane because it moved way too fast.  As it kept moving it disappeared and appeared again.  It was heading northwest then it changed direction to the southwest.  It was two of them that at one one point they crossed.  Something I have never seen.;35.6669;-101.3963
