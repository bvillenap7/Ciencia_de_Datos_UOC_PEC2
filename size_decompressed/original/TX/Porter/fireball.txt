Large bright red orange fireball in sky emits two smaller fireballs then disappears.;2013-05-25 20:15:00;5-10 seconds;Large bright red orange fireball in sky emits two smaller fireballs then disappears. Walked out of my house with my brother and started talking before his departure.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a large fireball in the sky and told my brother took look as well.  We both thought maybe it was a plane but thought it strange since the fireball was very bright and not typical of commercial planes in the area.  Living close to a major airport we see planes on a regular basis and can identify commercial planes by there flashing lights.  Once we realized that it could not be a plane with a bright red orange color light we started walking toward the yard to get a better look at it.  At the same time as I reached for my phone to record the event the bright red orange glowing fireball emitted a smaller fireball that went straight down.  A second or less after the first smaller fireball a second fireball was emitted.  Shortly after the release of the second smaller fireball the larger fireball disappears. We were so amazed by the strange lights that we quickly checked my phone to see if I captured any of it since it only lasted a few seconds.  I did get it on video but only the last couple seconds.  You have to see it on a larger screen to see the smaller fireball but the main fireball is very visible.  Wish I would have gotten both smaller fireballs coming out of the larger one.  Amazing!!;30.1212;-95.2678000000001
