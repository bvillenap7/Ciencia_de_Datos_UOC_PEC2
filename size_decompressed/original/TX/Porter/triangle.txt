The night was perfectly still and quiet, and the sky was perfectly clear, cold and my friend immediately spotted the object overhead.  My friend is a career retired Delta Airlines employee, worked the ticket counter.   Our location is in the country and about 12 miles from the Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH), so we see flights come and go.  The object was also observed by my wife. The object was traveling slowly from west to east, it was black against a black sky so no outline could be made out.  It did have white lights and a single blinking green light, which is what we saw move through the night sky.  It made no sound whatsoever, it was totally silent.  My friend said it did zigzag slightly, but I did not notice that.  We observed the object for about 1 minute before it disappeared behind the tree line.  Shortly thereafter we saw a commercial jet that had taken off from IAH airport, it was flying much higher and faster than the object and of course, loud jet engine noise.  So the object was probably at about 7,000’ to 10,000’ altitude if I had to make a guess. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken via telephone with the witness, and he corrects the date to February 04, 2011.
