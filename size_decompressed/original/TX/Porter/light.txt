Ball of light.;2014-12-07 02:15:00;2 minutes;At 02:15 on 12/7/14, I woke to let my dogs out.  When I went to the garage I noticed what I thought was that someone had left the garage light on.  When I went to turn it off the switch was already off.   I looked up and there was a ball of light floating in the garage.  It scared me and I felt that I scared it also.  Then it went right through the wall. I ran outside to watch it shoot into the sky at what you could say looked like the speed of light.   I am now a believer. . . In what I don't know but there is something going on.;30.1212;-95.2678000000001
