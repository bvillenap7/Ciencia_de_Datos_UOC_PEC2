Atleast 10 cars were pulled over on the side of the road.  I knew my daughters and I were not seeing things. I picked up my daughters from a slumber party on FM 1314.  We travelled to Porter which is off of HWY 59.  My 11 year old asked Mom, oh my God, what is that in the sky?  I turned around at the Kroger right under the underpass.  She sounded frantic.  I looked and safely saidProbably parachutes.  I drove back to 59 and proceeded to travel slowly on the feeder road going south towards Houston.  I was shocked and amazed at what I saw.  I looked around me and cars were pulling over on the sides of the road to see the objects.  There were about 15-20.  They looked like rocks or meteors floating suspended in the air.  I pulled over at a car dealership on the right and stared at them.  It was so unreal.  Like I was in a movie and it wasn't really happening.  One of the rocks looked very strange.  They were all at different altitudes and they were moving slowly towards the west/southwest.  I became aware of the fact that these objects could drop strait on our heads at any second,!so I backed out and left.  I turned around at the next exit.  By the time I got back to the spot and on the other side of the road heading north, the last of them could be seen just over the tree tops.  I headed up 1314 to Conroe.  I thought I could see them from the 242 loop, but no luck.  I don't know where they went or what in the world they were, but I would like to know if something like meteors can come into our atmosphere and float that way.  They appeared to be in 0 gravity.  With all of the others that saw I know I can't explain it away.;30.1212;-95.2678000000001
