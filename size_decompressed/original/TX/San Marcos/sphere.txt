Blue Orb Sighting &quotvideo recording&quot on 2 different iPhones at different times moving around the Moon.;2020-01-01 00:03:00;10 minutes;Blue Orb Sighting &quotvideo recording&quot on 2 different iPhones at different times moving around the Moon. On Friday, December 31, 2020 ((sic.  January 1st, 2021)) just after midnight at 12:03 AM we were outside on a neighbors patio celebrating New Years Eve.  We were admiring how bright the moon was that evening.  After looking up for a minute or so I noticed a bright Blue Orb moving rapidly in different directions around the moon and pulled out my iPhone since it was so strange and there was no visible light coming from the ground to the Orb.  My wife also pulled out her iPhone to record at different times.  The ORB moved very quickly in the sky and was visible (as it appeared close to the Moon) both with and without cloud cover which was moving rapidly across the Moon.  We have recording on 2 iPhones of this weird event.  On my wife’s recording the size of the Blue Orb appears smaller and then larger.  The Blue Orb appeared, disappeared and re-appeared on several occasions and moved very rapidly.  We sent our video to several folks who noticed the same things we did. I’ve never reported any UFO sightings in the past and believe this was not a natural phenomenon or some type of laser pointing / sourced event.  One of the individuals we sent this to indicated they watched an NBC report from the same day in Hawaii about Blue Orgs.  When we heard this we decided to file a report.  We have these videos.  We live in the Hill Country of Texas and this event was witnessed by 6 to 8 people.;29.8752195121952;-97.936646341464
