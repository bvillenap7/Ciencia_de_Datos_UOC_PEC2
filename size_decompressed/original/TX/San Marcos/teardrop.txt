One of us stood up and we all noticed it and turned.  The sky is overcast.  It was enormous.  It made the entire block seem darker with its shadow.  No lights or colors to it.  Just a big black shadow.  It seemed to be hovering slowly down to earth and then it flew up so fast it practically dissapeared.  It had rounded edges but wasnt a saucer.  It seemed to change shape but some of us disagree and think that it was rotating.;29.8752195121952;-97.936646341464
