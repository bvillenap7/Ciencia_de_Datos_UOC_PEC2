DANCING BRIGHT LIGHT SEEN TWICE WITHIN 2 WEEKS;2002-09-03 02:00:00;1 hour;DANCING BRIGHT LIGHT SEEN TWICE WITHIN 2 WEEKS ABOUT ONE WEEK AGO I WENT TO A FAMILY REUNION IN GLENROSE TX, IT WAS AT A CAMPGROUND SO THAT AT NIGHT THE SKY WAS CLEAR. I WAS OUTSIDE ABOUT 11:00 PM LOOKING AT THE STARS AND NOTICED A BRIGHT WHITE STAR THAT WAS MOVING. I FIRST THOUGHT IT WAS A PLANE BUT IT WAS MOVING VERY ERADDICALLY ALMOST LIKE IT WAS DANCING, ALSO THE LIGHT APPEARED TO PULSATE MORE INTENSLY EVERY TIME IT MADE A DRASTIC CHANGE IN ALTITUDE. I CALLED SEVERAL OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS TO WATCH IT AND WAS ALSO ABLE TO RECORD THE EVENT. THE FUNNY THING IS THAT LAST NIGHT I WAS AGAIN OUTSIDE LOOKING AT THE STARS WHERE I CURRENTLY LIVE IN SAN MARCOS TX AND SAW THE SAME THING. I WOKE MY GIRLFRIEND UP WHO CAME OUTSIDE AND WITNESSED THE SAME THING. I DONT THINK THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A SATELLITE OR ANY OTHER MAN MADE OBJECT LIKE THAT BECAUSE OF ITS ALTITUDE,PULSING LIGHT AND DRASTIC MOVEMENTS. I HAVE ALWAYS HAD ONLY MINIMAL INTEREST IN UFOS BUT THESE TWO SIGHTINGS HAVE DEFINITELY HEIGHTENED MY AWARENESS OF THEIR EXISTENCE ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

Bright light falling with gravity.;2013-09-01 03:10:00;few seconds;Bright light falling with gravity. One bright light, shaped like an upside down chevron, falling quickly with gravity then disappearing. Lasted about 2 seconds.  Further down the road, there were two subtle flashes of light, but on the other side of the road the initial light was on, and closer to the earth than the first bright light.;29.8752195121952;-97.936646341464
A very low, fast moving (like jet..no noise) light parallel to horizon..split to two and went out.  Between Wimberley and San Marcos Tx;2014-07-12 21:12:00;3-4 seconds;A very low, fast moving (like jet..no noise) light parallel to horizon..  split to two and went out.  Between Wimberley and San Marcos, Tx. Fast moving light.  First thought jet very low very fast and close, maybe a mile.  Maybe two.   East west parallel to horizon.  We were facing north. Kids saw, pointed..we both clearly saw it.  Fast. Split to two lights..went out.  Went 100% parallel to horizon.  Not down.;29.8752195121952;-97.936646341464
About 12 colored lights floating in a group overhead, some purple, green, and yellow/white just within the cloud line;2020-11-21 19:37:00;60-120 seconds;About 12 colored lights floating in a group overhead, some purple, green, and yellow/white just within the cloud line I was out walking at night and I was on a semi busy street in the neighborhood, there were a few people by their car at an apartment across the street. Suddenly, either something caught my eye or I had the urge to look up, and about 12 (from what I counted) round lights were hovering above, heading from south to north/north west, going decently slow but fast enough to fly into the cloud line with a minute or so to where they were not visible. It was light overcast and they were hovering just within or above the clouds, to where you could clearly see the lights but through a light haze. I remember there were a few purple, green, and I believe the rest were yellow/white?? I took a photo and the front leading lights appear to be two purple lights. I was the only person who saw and almost yelled out to the people across the street but I felt like it was for me to see if no one else saw it on their own, and I was just in awe staring at them feeling lucky to see s! uch an anomaly.;29.8752195121952;-97.936646341464
