As I'm looking into the sky I saw objects flying in the sky (it was obvious because they would cover up the stars as they passed by). All of the objects seemed to be close in proximity to where I was. Also, they all had tiny dim lights all over them and wear flying pretty slowly, almost like they were gliding. Also, there was a soft swooping/ gliding sound as the passed over head. The only thing that varied between them was their shape (or at least I was uncertain of their shapes, which lead me to believe they may differ). The first sighting I wanted to dismiss because it was (or what I saw of it) was a crescent shape, therefore I wanted to label it as a bird or something.  I took another look and noticed there were dim lights all over the object - ruling out it being a bird. A few minutes later I spotted another object.  This one was kind of in the shape of a plane or a chevron (its hard to tell because these objects were dark so some parts of them blended in with the night sky).  I knew it could not have been a plane because the object was way to close and there aren't any airports near by for a plane to be flying that low.  This object like the last had the unusual lights all over it as well. The third and final spotting of these objects I wasn't able to make clear of because it started to concern me.  I did notice the lights and also the speed remained the same.  The first two objects were flying from south to north and the last one i have forgotten. I am certain that what I saw was UFO's because I have never seen anything like this in my life.  I even phoned my father, who was a pilot for many years in the military and he could not think of any aircraft that fit my descriptions.;29.8752195121952;-97.936646341464
Chevron shaped object with rounded ends and internal glow flies over Texas City.;2014-11-01 01:20:00;~30 seconds;Chevron shaped object with rounded ends and internal glow flies over Texas city I really do not know any better way to describe what my friends and I saw that night.  It was a chevron shaped craft, looked to be about 50+ meters in size, had no lights on it nor did it make any sound.  It was just a bit lighter than the night time sky.  While having no lights, it appeared to have a faint glow moving about the craft as it flew over the city at a fairly quick speed.  The glow from inside was a blueish color.  The easiest way to describe the glow is to imagine the reflection of sunlight off water.  Here is a picture to give you an idea  http://www.learnamericanenglishonline.com/Word%20of%20the%20Day/WOD_images/water_reflection.jpg -   Imagine a solid black object with a faint blue glow moving about it like this pattern. The duration of this event lasted about 30 seconds, from the point I noticed this craft, till the point it moved out of view.;29.8752195121952;-97.936646341464
