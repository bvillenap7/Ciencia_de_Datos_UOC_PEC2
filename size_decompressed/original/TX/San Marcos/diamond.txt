The light appeared very bright for 30 minutes, then started to dim but then would get even brighter.  Looked a little like thew North star bt 10 times brighter.  When looking thru telescope, I seen a diamond shape, red collor, almost like fire, with a red glowing aoura around it, circle shaped.  The movement of the object was very fast as I had to move the telescope 6 different times in the 1.5 hors it was lit.  It finally disappeared, in one instance, bright as could be, the next gone!;29.8752195121952;-97.936646341464
