Giant V-Shaped Craft;1991-09-27 01:00:00;6-8 minutes;Giant V-Shaped Craft On the morning just sometime after 1:00 am, September 27, 1991.  In San Marcos, Texas  I was stargazing.  The sky was very clear, although there was no moon out that night, the stars could be seen clearly. I turned my attention on a star within the Southwestern part of the nigh sky, at this moment, The star seemed to just go out, like a light. I couldn't believe what had just happened, and immediately this captured my full attention. just then, I began to notice the other stars to left of the star that seemed to have just disappeared a moment ago, also began to go out one by one from my line of sight. I began to strain my eyes to better adjust them with the darkness of the night sky. There were some street lights nearby, but they were behind me at the time, and did not have interference. As I stood there watching the stars seem to continue going out like lights one at a time, I took notice of a large black silhouette in the sky, all I could make of it that m! oment was just a giant black mass, shape still unclear. The unknown object was traveling South, then it began to tilt, and turned towards the south, southwest, now, moving away from me, at the time it tilted to the right, I then noticed it's shape. It was a giant V shaped u.f.o. It had no lights, no sound. It was just a black Silhouette, V-shaped craft. My guess would say it was about 300 yards long, and about 1-2 hundred yards wide. A huge craft! I was truly shocked, and amazed. I thought to myself it was larger than entire football stadium. It drifted silently a few hundred feet above the trees, totally silent, A capitol class cruiser. I don't know why, but this thought just came to mind A capitol  class cruiser . That night in particular, there was a new home improvement store opening on the opposite side of the highway from where I was when I encountered the sighting. At that time, there were two searchlights used as an attraction for the new building. To me, the c! raft seemed to be heading over the highway, as if to be attrac! ted to t he traffic on the road. But the way it suddenly pitched to the right, away from the highway, it now seemed to me as if it was trying to avoid the searchlights which were still in operation. I know what I had seen that night. And I know it was not man -made, and it was not from this world. I have spoken to only a few people about this incident. And it has been years since I have mentioned this to anyone since then.;29.8752195121952;-97.936646341464
Flying triangle in sky over San Marcos;2006-04-05 22:25:00;2 min;Flying triangle in sky over San Marcos I looked up thinking that I was seeing a plane, but it was unmistakably a triangle because I caught a glimpse of its full shape in the moon's glow.  I had white lights on all three corners and a single red light near the rear.  I made no sound and was flying rather low and slow.  It was also moving with the FLAT SIDE of the triangle forward V so the top portion of the V was leading, not the point.  I just stopped dead in the parking lot and watched it disappear over the horizon going south.  Two other people were in the parking lot, but didn't acknowledge that anything unusual was in the sky.  I know this wasn't a plan because one flew by a few moments later and the light configuration was different, it made a sound, and followed a normal (for this area) flight pattern across the sky.

object flew over me, in triangle shape with red/orange/white lights erratically moving.  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2009-01-30 20:04:00;25 minutes;object flew over me, in triangle shape with red/orange/white lights erratically moving. I had just got off of work. The sky was bright due to the parking lot and didn't have many stars. All you could see was the crescent moon to my right and a bright star below it. I looked up momentarily and something caught my attention. It was a unique red star, it didn't look like the red of a plane. It looked more like mars but even brighter. It went right under the moon and moved towards the north. I thought it's gotta be a plane at first but as I kept watching it, I saw no flashing lights. Planes always fly over from the north and so as I was watching it a plane flew by and the object started following it. It was moving very slowly and would move subtly up and down as it went in a northern direction. Then it went more towards the west, and sort of stopped in one spot (turning into odd shapes of lights) and started coming back towards me. This is when it got weird, Instead of being one bright red light I saw 2. Then it was coming even closer, and I saw 2 red lights and an almost orange light. It was not flashing. It then turned it's shape or did something and had 3 red lights (sort of orange hue) in the shape of a triangle. It then flew slowly right over my head. I could actually see the outline of the object. It appeared to almost change shape before my eyes, but I made out a triangle. It flew over me and then went back towards the east, almost did an oval shape. At this point I was convinced this was not a plane or a helicopter. It started moving back towards the north. I was standing outside of my car with my lights on so I flashed my lights at it. It then actually came back towards me after doing this. I yelled at a co-worker to come look at it. It was changing from white to red erratically. Not flashing, just changing. Like possibly rotating or changing its shape. When I flashed my lights at it, it was pretty far away and once I yelled at the co-worker to come look it started coming back towards me, this time lower and even more over my head. After it went over our heads, it had 2 bright light wh! ites on the back. We could see the shape of it. It was triangle but had other things on it. He thought it looked like a satellite but agreed it was way too low. It then went back towards the north and I stopped watching it. We see planes fly over everyday since there is an airport close by, but this was beyond bizarre. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));29.8752195121952;-97.936646341464
Triangle?;2009-06-01 23:30:00;2 min.;Triangle? Monday 11:30 P.M. San Marcos,Tx Couldn't sleep and was out on tha back deck having a smoke.Heard a jet plane sound,but quite loud and low  pitched,like a passenger jet throttling down to land,but at a steady low tone.No airports around anywhere close,I'm  in the Hill Country,and it was coming right over the house.I got up to look,and a group of 3 lights,2 to the side  like on wing tips,one in the rear,and one just in front of the two,that was strobing.  It was about 1000-1500 ft., up, and the size of a passenger plane.It was only travelling at about 80 -100 mph.I could not see the shape of the  craft,but all the lights were white with no red or green ones.It was travelling in a south west direction and no  airports for at least 80 miles in that direction.I watched it till it was out of sight,about 2 mins.;29.8752195121952;-97.936646341464
Triangular low flying, slow traveling, low-toned dark object with steady green and red lights.;2009-06-24 05:00:00;30 seconds;Triangular low flying, slow traveling, low-toned dark object with steady green and red lights. 5:00 AM my friend and I were studying when we first heard what sounded like a helicopter, but soon realized as it came closer it became a low deep-toned motor sound and was not loud enough to be a helicopter.   It came through the trees and we saw green at red lights first as it flew low, maybe 20 feet over a two story house, and traveled slow.  The craft had no visible markings and its' pencil dark color was hard to see against the dark sky.  Steady green and red lights were at the front and at the rear.   It's hard to recall if the lights were on the outer triangular points at the back because of the shock of the strange object moving so close over our heads.   It had no yellow or white lights at all, not even headlights.  Also, no airports are around for about 80 miles.

3 lighted silent craft flys slowly over university;2009-07-24 22:00:00;1.5 - 2 minutes;3 lighted silent craft flys slowly over university While walking at night from my house to my friend’s nearby apartment, my friend and I witnessed an unidentified flying object. I was looking at the stars, identifying constellations, when I turned to look at the sky in the southeast, over the top of a building I saw a flying object enter my field of vision. The UFO flew completely, eerily silent, at a low altitude probably around a few hundred feet, and at an unusually slow and constant pace. The object was dark with three large bright white lights in a triangular configuration on its underside, one toward the front, two in the back. It was somewhat difficult to make out the exact shape due to its angle, and the prominence of it’s lights although it appeared to be flat and triangular, with each white light close to each tip. The size appeared to be around that of a large helicopter. There was one faint, small flashing light towards the front on the side of the object which seemed to emit multiple colors of w! hich I remember green, white/yellow, and blue. The object flew over us westward toward the university campus and was visible for around one and a half, possibly two minutes. My friend who was about 30 feet in front of me and who witnessed it for around 30 seconds saw the same object.;29.8752195121952;-97.936646341464
Boomerang shaped object seen in the night skies over San Marcos, Texas.;2009-09-20 02:00:00;60 seconds;Boomerang shaped object seen in the night skies over San Marcos, Texas. Large object about half mile away in the sky. About 1000 ft off the ground. We witnessed the object slowly hover away from us towards the moon. It was only illuminated by the moons light, had the moon not been out it could not have been seen. It was probably goin around 30 mph. It eminated no light or sound. It was observed from an upstairs porch by two of three people. The person who did not witness did not have her glasses. It was an opaque metallic gray color. The object itself looked like a massive boomerang with a wide wing span. After about 30-45 seconds of slowly hovering over the city it either dissipated into the clouds or disappeared altogether and it was gone.;29.8752195121952;-97.936646341464
Black Triangle glides through San Marcos, Texas.;2014-10-27 03:00:00;6 seconds;Black Triangle glides through San Marcos, Texas. This morning around 3 am, two friends and I saw a group of 3 lights in triangular form. The lights were not pulsating or strobing, just white lights.  The inside of the triangle appeared to be a slightly different tint than the night sky.  We were in The Village on Telluride Complex in San Marcos, Texas.  The Black Triangle glided across the sky, about the same speed as a plane, until it was out of our sight.  Definitely a believer.;29.8752195121952;-97.936646341464
