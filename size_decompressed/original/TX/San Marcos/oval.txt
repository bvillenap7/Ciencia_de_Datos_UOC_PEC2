It changed, glowed bright white and then just seemed to vanish. I had been home from work about an hour or so, when I went on the back deck of my 2 story apartment.  I saw a silver round object moving over the treeline rather slowly.  I called for my wife to come see it, but she was in the bathroom.   It was travelling from a North to South direction.  I was close enough to see it had no wings or blinking lights as on an airplane.  I heard no sound. Just saw it move slowly, the it changed to glow a very bright white, and I could not see its silver color anymore. It was coming from left to right and it flashed, and then was out of there.  I could not track it with my eyes. It glowed bright, bright white and then it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));29.8752195121952;-97.936646341464
Approx 5mph-900mph in 2 secs;2004-04-17 20:30:00;8 secs;Approx 5mph-900mph in 2 secs I noticed the oval object as I left a near gas station next to my apartment.  The object was close, did not have flashing lights but seemed to glow and had a 3 pointed design on the side. Moved very slow no sound and it seemed like it was watching me, as I pointed at it to tell my friend to look, it took off towards the distance at an impossible rate. There were two airplanes in the distance that were close to the airport which is about 40 or so miles away. It took the object about 2 secs to get from were I was to the airport and disappeared after it paassed under the airplanes.;29.8752195121952;-97.936646341464
