Formation of bright round lights.  ((anonymous report));2016-09-14 03:05:00;5 seconds;Formation of bright round lights What I witnessed was a very low flying formation of large circular lights in a straight horizontal line, each equidistant from each other.  I think there were 6 lights. Much larger and brighter than an airplanes standard running lights.  The craft or objects probably no more than 300 feet above the ground.   I think 2 of the lights were red the rest were white.  One of the red lights was blinking.  It went right over my apartment.  Flying very low.  I saw it from my room looking out the window.   I am very interested if anyone else saw this.  I could hear it moving through the air but didn't sound like a jet engine or propeller.  Something different.  Very peculiar.  Flying low and relatively silent.  I've seen lots of airplanes in the night sky and this was something very different.
