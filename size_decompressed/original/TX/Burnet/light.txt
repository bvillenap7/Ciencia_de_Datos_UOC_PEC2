AN ABSOLUTE TRUE SIGHTING OF SOMETHING FAR SUPERIOR TO OUR PRESENT TECHNOLOGY.;1977-07-01 22:00:00;30+ MINUTES;AN ABSOLUTE TRUE SIGHTING OF SOMETHING FAR SUPERIOR TO OUR PRESENT TECHNOLOGY. I WAS WITH A FRIEND LOOKING UP AT THE SKY IN OUR SLEEPING BAGS WHEN HE SAID LOOK AT THAT! I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING. THEN HE SAID LOOK AT THAT,STILL I SAW NOTHING. THEN HE GRABBED MY HEAD AND SAID LOOK AT MY FINGER. STARTLED I LOOKED AND THEN SAW WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO SHOW ME. WE WATCHED TWO BRIGHT NEON RED/ORANGE LIGHTS TRAVELING AT A VERY FAST PACE ACROSS THE SKY. IT WAS FASCINATING,BUT I GOT MY FULL ETERNAL ATTENTION WHEN THEY BOTH STOPPED INSTANTLY AND HELD THEIR POSITION IN THE SKY. WE WATCHED AS THEY STAYED IN THE SAME POSITION FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES. THEN FROM OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER AT ABOUT 7 O'CLOCK,A SINGLE IDENTICAL LIGHT ZOOMED AT A MUCH FASTER PACE THAN THE ORIGINAL TWO WERE TRAVELING AND CAME UPON THE OTHERS. WE WATCHED THE THREE LIGHTS FOR 20 TO 30 MINUTES THEN TWO OF THEM TOOK OFF IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION,MAYBE THREE O'CLOCK. THE TWO TOOK AT LEAST TWO MINUTES OF TRAVEL TO THE POINT WHERE WE LOST VISION OF THEM. THE REMAINING LIGHT ZOOMED AT ABOUT 10 O'CLOCK AND WAS OUT OF SIGHT IN THREE OR FOUR SECONDS. I HAVE NEVER BEFORE OR SINCE SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. I KNOW THAT WHATEVER THEY WERE,THEY WERE UNDER INTELLIGENT CONTROL. THEY WERE SO FAR AWAY THAT THEY WERE EITHER VERY HUGE OR VERY, VERY BRIGHT.;30.7766;-98.2641999999998

Blinking lights 2x2 followed by an arc of pinpoint lights hovering high in the atmosphere.;2020-08-15 01:00:00;3 hours;Blinking lights 2x2 followed by an arc of pinpoint lights hovering high in the atmosphere. So during a trip this weekend doing some Astrophotography out at a dark location.  I was imaging M31 Andromeda Galaxy and while trying to find M31 with my naked eye I noticed a blinking light up in the sky. Thinking it was an airplane it would move.  It never moved.  Thought must be a satellite still never moved. Looked through binoculars and saw the blinking lights.  Then we went to the AP 130 and could see 2 x 2 lights blinking in succession followed by an arc of very small lights flashing after the 2x2 lights flashed.  This was all flashing in a split second.  My buddy slewed his Takahashi 106 over to it and took a photo of it.  I took a photo of the computer screen of one of the pictures captured which I will include.  The red is just for night viewing. After a few hours, we could tell it was moving slowly across the sky in what seemed to be a random way.  Started in the N NE in Lacerta region of the sky high above Andromeda (which was my target I was shooting).  After a while it moved across meridian and then proceeded to move South over my head and finally behind me.  Finally after 04:00 we went to bed still seeing it blinking further South.;30.7766;-98.2641999999998
