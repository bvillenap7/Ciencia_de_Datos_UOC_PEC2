We were outside about 9pm on November 13,2007. The sky was really clear and we were looking at the stars. Then we noticed 3 (what we thought was stars) they started moving back and forth and 1 went down then back up. at first we thought it might be planes. But it was really different. I had my camera so I put it on night setting without flash, just tring to get pictures of the stars. We did NOT see these shapes in the sky.We did see a flash of red, and yellow. It was only when I went to print my pictures that I saw this. I was shocked!;29.0378;-95.698
