Huge black triangle with 7 lights, very silent, right above trees.;1997-03-13 18:30:00;10 minutes;Huge black triangle with 7 lights, very silent, right above trees. March 13, 1997 about dusk I was coming in from the grocery store when I noticed an unusually bright light just above the trees close to home here north of San Antonio, TX.  We live under the flight path from Austin to San Antonio and out in the country. I just figured it was an airplane.  I watched it get brighter and brighter as it approached. Then I saw that it was a black triangular shape. It looked HUGE as it passed slowly and silently over me.  I stopped the car and got out to watch and study it, as I had never seen anything like it.  I wanted to memorize every detail. It was close enough that I could see that it had lights recessed under the wings and they were of different colors.  There were 4 down one wing and 3 down the other.  I watched till it disappeared behind the trees, heading west.  Oddly I didn’t feel any fear of it, only intense curiosity.  I went home and told my husband who just kind of blew me off so I didn’t mention it again. During the night I got up with the baby and had the radio on.  When I heard the news of the lights appearing above Phoenix I just knew that this was what I had seen earlier.;29.7284301342289;-98.0955373154382
