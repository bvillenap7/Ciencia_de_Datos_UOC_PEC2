Not even a few seconds before that were staring up at the stars since it was such a clear night. My best friend had said something so we all were looking at eachother talking when the everything lit up like lighting which we knew was impossible.  So we look up immediately and I see a bright white light about an inch under the north star (almost the exact same size as the north star) and it just.. blew up? The white light turned into a ring of light expanding out from the center and I didn't see the trail but everyone of my buddies saw a smoke trail that was going through the ring and then it just disappeared.. we freaked out for a while. we felt so uneasy after it happened.;29.7284301342289;-98.0955373154382
Mysterious intense red glow lights up area;2016-07-24 22:00:00;3 seconds;Mysterious intense red glow lights up area Red glow illuminated several acres of field and houses.  No apparent source or point of origin.  Glow was intense enough to clearly see affected lit up area as if it were daylight.  Lasted approximately 3 seconds, fading in for about 2 seconds and then the most intense glow lasted for the remainder.  Red glow did not fade out, it cut off sharp.  Bright enough to shine indoors, and light up frame of doors and windows from the inside perspective.;29.7284301342289;-98.0955373154382
