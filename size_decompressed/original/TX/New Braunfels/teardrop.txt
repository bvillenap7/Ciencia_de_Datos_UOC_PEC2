Looking for Jupiter, I looked into the nighttime sky and saw an object shaped like a teardrop.. when I looked closer with my binoculars, it looked more like a spacecraft by both the way it looked and moved.   Suddenly as I took off my binoculars… I saw it go down in the sky for about 2 seconds… made a flash and blew up.;29.7284301342289;-98.0955373154382
Glowing object that a perfect teardrop light descended from.;2020-03-31 20:43:00;8 minutes;Glowing object that a perfect teardrop light descended from. Unexplained sighting: March 31, 2020   On March 31, 2020 at approximately 8:43PM in New Braunfels, Texas, I was on my porch, which has views for at least 40 miles.  I was looking out Northeast and suddenly there were these glowing lights, the color of luminarias. (orange-yellow, like the glow of a hot air balloon).  There was a round orb to the right and a square-ish light a slight distance away from the orb.  Suddenly a big “teardrop”, almost as big as the square light dropped out of the corner of the square and descended slowly and briefly. This shape was a perfect teardrop that looked like it was liquid gold dripping from the square light.  Then all three of these suddenly went out.  I kept watching and saw the round light re-appear about 10 miles further then go out and then again about 20+ miles further and descended until it went out.  Nothing happened after this.  This whole sequence took less than 8 minutes.  There were some small craft airplanes in the area.  This was not a plane, or a helicopter or a drone.  These were not lights, but a steady glow.  The teardrop light was VERY distinct.;29.7284301342289;-98.0955373154382
