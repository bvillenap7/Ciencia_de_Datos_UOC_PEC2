I was in the back yard area of my apartment complex with only my dog when I saw what I thought was a drone.  1 solid black object that appeared to be a pentagonal pyramid flying slowly through the air.  It looked to be about the size of a small car and less than 1000ft or so from the ground.  It was about a mile from my location. It moved from the NE to the North gaining altitude in a slow bank.  I saw lights like big LEDs that lined the edge of the craft and were colors like red and green that lit in sequence like a wave. The movement was the strange part since it wobbled like a poorly thrown frisbee and rotated clockwise in relation to the ground fairly slowly.  From what I can tell it had to have crossed I-35 from East to West.  I continued to watch it move in a Northerly direction until it got out of sight still gaining altitude. Hardly a cloud in the sky, at least in that direction.  I have 20/15 vision, and I'm a veteran. I have never seen anything like it and I've had interest in aircraft since childhood having attended a handful of airshows. It wasn't a conventional craft. It wasn't a piece of trash because this thing was clearly rigid and to well defined, especially considering the lights. Hence, why my first thought was a drone. I knew something was wrong when I noticed the strange movement of it. It also had no trail or noise signature. I have recorded some video of it on my Snapchat.;29.7284301342289;-98.0955373154382
