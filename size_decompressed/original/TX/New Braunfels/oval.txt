oval shaped, various random colors, S like flight pattern, vanished.;2003-12-16 04:30:00;20 seconds;oval shaped, various random colors, S like flight pattern, vanished. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS  The light was various, like a diamond, although random, in patterns. The way this thing changed colors is like a horizontal hold on a TV, and when the horizontal line passed down horizontally, it would change colors. This vehicle, from arms length, looked like a dull pencil tip. At the time I saw this event, I noticed a deer, in my side yard, go into a full sprint AFTER I saw the intense white light. After this, I tried to forget about what had happend, but I could not forget, so I closed my eyes. The instant I closed my eyes, my right sholder blade muscle starting twiching rapidly. I thought the rapid twiching would just go away, but it did not. This went on for approximately 10 seconds. I became worried for some reason, so I widely opened my eyes, and the instant I did, the rapid twiching just stopped, as quickly as it had started it just stopped!  FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS  At the time I saw the first sight of the vehicle, I was laying on my bed, facing the west, looking up diagnally, when my eyes locked on to this vehicle I noticed the first change in colors and at the same time it was hovering. The sky was clear, windy, and at night 4:30 AM. I noticed this vehicle decending in an S like pattern continuing to decend in the S-like patteren until it just disappeared over the canyon's horizen.  Let me explain this intense white light. This additional event took place at 5:45 AM after i saw the vehicle do its thing in the sky. I could not sleep knowing what I had just experienced. I mean you try and go to sleep after you see this outragious thing in the sky, but sleep was not possible at the time. So I just lay there hoping to be abducted, just so I would know what it would be like. Just for the experience, and then this is what happend. Lying there in hope I would see more then just this unidentifiable flying object in the sky,  with my eyes half-open, because I was a little sleepy given the time. This ultra-white, intense bright light, covered my side yard and totaly brightened the yard. I could see the grass, the trees, the bark on the trees, from where I was looking from, (my west bedroom window). After this event happend, the rapid twiching took place. Later I had a headache and felt dizzy. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));29.7284301342289;-98.0955373154382
Stumble upon unidentified craft out on country road.;2005-01-14 21:25:00;Less than a minute;Stumble upon unidentified craft out on country road. Last evening after getting off work, I headed to my girlfriends house, who lives out in the country. Driving down the road in the dark country side I came around a bend and my headlights shine on an Oval craft of somesorts in the distance. It was Maybe 50 feet or so off the ground on the road. It left quickly off into the sky after I witnessed it. I had my camera in the passenger seat and tried to take what pictures i could of it fleeing. I'll get those developed today sometime.;29.7284301342289;-98.0955373154382
Red orange flare like object flying through New Braunfels, TX, at 1130pm 4/22/16.;2016-04-22 23:30:00;1 minute;Red orange flare like object flying through New Braunfels, TX, at 1130pm 4/22/16. My wife and I saw what we first thought was a plane over us, but then realized it was not have a flashing light and was now bright white, but red orange color, we first thought it was a flare, but it did not move like one.  It moved from our left to our right pretty fast, no sound and disappeared.  I took a video and when I tried to play back, it did not work.  My wife and I were looking at it as I was recording, she was even telling me to zoom in.   After it disappeared we looked at each other and tried playing it back, but nothing, like it never recorded.  Early during the evening around 10ish we saw what seemed like a disco ball in the sky with flashing colors.  It bounced around a little and then slowly moved out of site.  Wow a night for us to remember.;29.7284301342289;-98.0955373154382
