Zigzagging lights near municiple airport.;2007-05-18 02:30:00;3-5 seconds;Zigzagging lights near municiple airport. At about 2:30 in the morning I was looking up, and out of my window when a single yellow or possibly orange ( I am colorblind) light about the size of a lamp on a street light appeared overhead.It made no noise whatsoever, and moved more quickly than anything I have ever seen. The light immediately zig-zagged about 4 times before disappearing in a south east direction (going towards Seguin, Texas) Its worth noting that I live very close to a municiple airport, although in my 20 or so years of living here, I have never seen a light this close move so quickly and in such an irregular pattern.

Observed unusual bright, red/orange light hovering for at least 15 min., Texas Hill Country.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD));2009-02-05 22:45:00;15 minutes;Observed unusual bright, red/orange light hovering for at least 15 minutes, 02/05/2009, 9:45pm-10pm, Texas Hill Country I had been away from home and when I returned, was walking our dogs down the street, towards the end of the cul-de-sac.  The time was between 9:45pm and 10:00pm.  We live in a very rural, country setting.  I happened to look towards the West and noticed a very distinct, bright, orange/red light hovering in the sky, just above a mountain ridge.  We live in the Texas Hill Country between Austin and San Antonio.  I knew it wasn't a star, too big, not the right color and too low in the sky.  I knew it wasn't a plane, planes don't hover like this.  I knew it wasn't a helicopter, they don't hover for that length of time.  A few planes did fly in the vicinity of this object during the 15 minutes I stood and observed this thing.  Surely, the pilots of these planes saw what I saw.  The distance between this object and myself was approximatelty 2-3 miles.  My dogs became very impatient with me just standing there and staring at this thing.  I know I stood there at least 15 minutes.  I kept thinking - If I can see this, can they see me?  I was so scared as I had my left my 10 year old son alone in the house and my husband was out of town.  I kept thinking, I can't be 'snatched up' as there won't be anyone to take care of our son.  Finally, this very bright orange/red light slowly sank below the ridge to where I couldn't see it anymore.  When my husband returned the next night, Friday night, I finally was able to get him outside and walked him down the street to where I was when I saw this thing and told him the whole story.  I was and still am so scared about what I saw.  It was NOT normal.  Thanks for letting me share.  I haven't known where to go with this information and finally heard on a late night radio talk show with George Norie about this website. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??

I thought it was a small aircraft until it stopped and backtracked in the opposite direction, headed west.   Then a second light appeared above it and it reversed again and both orange lights started to move in unison going east.   I zig zag a couple of times and slowed down.  It was not a helicopter, it was not a small aircraft.   I do not drink or do any kind of drugs or prescriptions.   Hope this is useful just in case others report the same thing since I was alone in my sighting.;29.7284301342289;-98.0955373154382
Three stationary flashing lights seen in sky, with lights forming the points of what appear to be a triangle shape/formation.;2019-09-15 04:41:00;1 hour possibly longer;Three stationary flashing lights seen in sky, with lights forming the points of what appear to be a triangle shape/formation. Outside on porch early in the morning, when flashing light in sky was noticed.  Object/light was stationary and very easily visible.  Object was flashing blue, red, and white and varied in intensity.  Upon further investigation there were three of such objects/lights in the sky and were the points of what appeared to be a triangle formation with the top light varying slightly in color and frequency of flashes.  Top light flashed in very slow cadence, bottom two points/lights were flashing very rapidly.  This was observed recorded and photographed for over an hour before phone died.  All objects/flashing lights were stationary and did not appear to move at all.;29.7284301342289;-98.0955373154382
Moving light thought to be a star at first;2020-08-29 20:59:00;2-3 minutes;Moving light thought to be a star at first It was a clear night. I was sitting on my porch just stargazing. Movement to the left of a star that I was looking at caught my eye. It looked like another star but it was moving! I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me so I looked away to let my eyes readjust and then looked back up at it. It was still there and still moving. It was going on a downward but also western direction. The speed of it moving was faster than what I’ve been seeing planes move at but it was also a jumpy kind of movement, it wasn’t smooth in just one straight line. I really tried telling myself it was a plane or a “moving” star which is probably not even a thing. I noticed that it began getting brighter and appeared to be coming in closer. It was very very high  in the sky but that’s what it looked like, like it was coming closer towards me. That, coupled with the fact that it was getting brighter frightened me and I pulled out my phone to record just in case. It was only a few seconds later that it then appeared to get smaller or further away again and dimmer until it dimmed all the way out or disappeared in a way. I don’t record it all because I wanted to to see it with my own eyes instead of looking at it on the phone camera .It’s almost as if me recording sacred it away. It was weird.;29.7284301342289;-98.0955373154382
