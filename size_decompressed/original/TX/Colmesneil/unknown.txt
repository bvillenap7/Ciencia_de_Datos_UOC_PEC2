The most disturbing aspect of this object (and the character that caught and held my attention) was its ‘amorphous’ nature.;2007-02-17 20:10:00;1 hour;My wife, her parents and I witnessed a very strange object at approximately 20:10 on Saturday, February 18, 2007. The object had no discernable shape or size (but must have been somewhat large due to its apparent distance from our location). It was very bright white, or blue-white, or orange, or red-white in color which constantly changed in no particular order or sequence, and continuously varied in intensity.  The light intensity of this object was at least an order of magnitude higher than that of any current aircraft landing or taxi lighting system I am familiar with, and the object was observed traveling away from our location, therefore, by comparison, landing and/or taxi lights would not be very apparent, if this object was a landing aircraft traveling away from us. In addition, the familiar blinking of aircraft position lights was not present at all.  We watched the object from an initial distance of approximately 4 miles and approximately 15000 feet AGL (which seemed to vary somewhat), as it traveled away from us from east to west, for about ¾ of an hour. The height AGL of the object was approximately constant (about 15000 feet) therefore, after ¾ of an hour, the object was about 16 miles away. The most disturbing aspect of this object (and the character that caught and held my attention) was its ‘amorphous’ nature. We viewed this object for almost an hour, mostly through field glasses and a high powered camera lens, and were struck by the constant change of its shape, size, color and position. The experience was disturbing for us, since we could not explain its behavior. However, if the flight path is extrapolated on a map, it does come close to Ft. Hood, TX.  Perhaps the object was a new military aircraft undergoing flight qualification testing?;30.8983;-94.3899
