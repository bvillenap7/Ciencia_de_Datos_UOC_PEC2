Three flashing lights appeared through a fog in the Northwest over Tolar Texas, Highway 377.  At first, we though it was lightening or fireworks on the horizon.  They flashed on and off in a regular pattern slightly north of Hwy 377.  They passed quickly and silently over our car.  My daughter caught the last seconds as it disappeared behind some trees.  There were no green or red lights only very bright, white lights shining equally behind and in front.  I would like to know what it was.;32.3808;-97.8779
