Ongoing nightly sightings in East Texas.;2015-04-03 17:00:00;all night;Ongoing nightly sightings in East Texas. I have always been a star watcher.  In February I was sitting on my parents front porch and noticed some strange lights.   At first I thought that is a plane, but it didn't move.  Then I noticed another, same thing, then a third.  Then I noticed that they were in a giant triangle.  The reason I noticed them was because they were flashing between yellow and red.  They don't look like a star.   Then I started looking and there were two of these formations int he front yard and two in the back yard.   After several weeks, I pointed them out to my Mother.  When the sky was not cloudy I would go out and they are always there in the night sky.  March 30th, I was visitng my sister in Chandler, Texas, and went out in the back yard to look at the sky........they were there.   The 2nd night I awoke suddenly at 2:30 a.m.  I went outside and looked up and they were still there... but there were also chem trails in the sky.
