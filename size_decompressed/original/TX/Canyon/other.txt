Lights over canyon;2004-08-24 23:40:00;38 minutes;Lights over canyon Over the duration of about 38 to an hour, we spotted....strange lights in two seperate groups. The lights included three in one group and three in another, these lights all stayed within each others boundrys. Then out of nowhere, one of the lights just seemed to fly off...the rest just disapeared. After sometime of looking for the same objects in that area, we came across another light.. now this light lit up and would seem to fade out... now you can understand that i find this a bit odd...i mean, you never even see stuff like this in canyon..
