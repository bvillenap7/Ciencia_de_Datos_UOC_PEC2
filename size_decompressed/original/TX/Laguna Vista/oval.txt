Hovering over my Truck.  ((anonymous report));2009-06-30 14:00:00;5 minutes;Oval sphere hovering over my truck at approx. 500 feet  I Posted this in 8/24/2010.  I failed to mention on first post. this Object was the size of a 4 door car.  I estimated this size due to a high flying airliner.  I remember the vapor trails coming off the high altitude jet.  A near by airport dispatch a helicopter. When I pointed a handgun at this object it climbed altitude a high rate of speed traveling away from us south and vanished. I recall that day as clear skies, there were no clouds.  there was no sound coming from this object.  I told my spouse when we arrived home and she did not believe me. But my nephew told her the same thing.  That evening I turned on the T.V. and saw the same objects being reported by people along the border and in Mexico on the NEWS.  Krgv The videos I saw on T.V. showed these objects very tiny. there not they are big about the size of a car.
