Glowing Cone Travels Downward, Splits in Two and Disappears.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2011-03-11 22:00:00;5 seconds;Glowing Cone Travels Downward, Splits in Two and Disappears I saw a bright, self-illuminated cone-shaped object in the sky around 10pm the night of March 11th, 2011.  It was glowing and had a hazy, smokey ring around it.  It was moving quickly at a 45 degree angle toward the horizon with the open end up.  As it was moving, the back half of the object separated and got smaller until disappearing completely.  It was as if it just melted into the sky. Immediately after the front half of the object did the same thing, shrinking and disappearing.  My entire experience lasted no more than 5 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??
