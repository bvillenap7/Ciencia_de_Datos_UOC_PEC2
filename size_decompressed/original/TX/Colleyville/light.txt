It remained in the same area but changed positions clearly.  It stayed in the sky for at least the 15 minutes we stood outside and looked at it. we checked it again and it was still there as we looked through some binoculars about 30 more minutes.  After about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Same as above.  Regular guy, retired and my family was over for leftover Thanksgiving meal when my son called with the first sighting. I did check the sky tonight, 11/28/99 at same time, 19:15, and there were no unusual lights or objects in the sky.;32.8872;-97.146
