DFW airport area, round object sighted much faster, smaller, shinier and higher than commercial jets in vicinity.;2014-12-28 11:55:00;12:00;DFW airport area, round object sighted much faster, smaller, shinier and higher than commercial jets in vicinity. My husband and I stepped outside to enjoy the warmth of the sun, after cloudy days.  Over 22 years living approximately 5 miles west of DFW airport we see aircraft regularly and have watched weather balloons and large hawks.   As we were looking over our roof in the northern blue sky, we saw what appeared to be a whitish silver weather balloon circling twice, rising, and rapidly moving due south.  It was approximately 45,000 feet up.   There was a passenger jet, approximately 35,000 ft, moving southwest and another at approximately 25,000 moving due south.  The object was moving at a much greater speed than either aircraft.   As it was directly above us it began to look more like a hawk or smaller aircraft shape and would glow in the sunshine.   It just disappeared in the sunlight the further south it went while the jets were still overhead. This took place in approximately 30 to 45 seconds.;32.8872;-97.146
