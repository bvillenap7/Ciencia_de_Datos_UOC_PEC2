super bright white light;2011-06-01 05:15:00;30 seconds;I was headed north on Texas 83, a mile south of town, when everything around me lit up as if the sun had risen.   I then looked slightly to the west of my location and saw what looked like a really bright star that was showing through the clouds. After taking another glimpse of the object after looking back at the road, a wide beam of super bright white light was observed shining down into the trees approximately Â¼ mile away, next to the objects bright light was a bright, almost lime green light.   After one more look back at the object, it was no where to be found.   I stopped to see if I could possibly hear an engine, or see something else but there was silence.;31.506;-99.9136
