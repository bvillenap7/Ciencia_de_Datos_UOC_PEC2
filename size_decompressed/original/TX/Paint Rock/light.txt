Lights over Paint Rock;2010-10-07 21:00:00;Approx. 2 hrs.;Lights over Paint Rock On Thursday, October 7th at about 9 PM while fishing at the dam in Paint Rock Texas, I saw a reddish orange light appear over the tree tops in the distance  to the north-east. It could have been 2 miles away or it could have been 20 miles away, I can't be sure. One light appeared for a few seconds. It flashed a couple of times (not like a plane) and moved erratically (which caught my attention) and vanished. A few minutes later, two lights appeared about 10 degrees apart in the sky near the same location as the original light. They could be seen flashing and  moving erratically, and they vanished after only a few seconds visual. Approximately 10 minutes later, two lights then appeared much closer together in the sky nearer the location of the original light. They flashed alternately,  in sync, and vanished after a minute or so. Finally, and about half hour later, one light reappeared in the sky about 10 degrees west of the original light location. It moved erratically, vertically  and horizontally, and then seemed to get further away and climb higher in the sky for the next 30 minutes, and it disappeared. Due to the way the lights flashed and moved I don't believe them to have been created by any airplanes, helicopters, satellites, weather balloons, falling  stars or fireflies. It was very unusual. I have witnessed my first UFO.;31.506;-99.9136
