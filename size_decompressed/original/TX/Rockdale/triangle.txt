It glided silently over the top of the house and then over the town going south towards Austin.  I waited for some sort of sound but there was none.  The silver glistened as the light bounced off it.  It was gliding very slow and very low over the trees tops.  I was so amazed that I didnâ€™t think of the camera until it was gone from sight.  I wonder if anyone else witnessed it?;30.6621;-97.0089
