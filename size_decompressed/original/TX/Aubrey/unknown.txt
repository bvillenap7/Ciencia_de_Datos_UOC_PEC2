Bright Light in Southern Sky Over Frisco, Texas;2013-10-19 20:15:00;20 minutes;Bright Light in Southern Sky Over Frisco, Texas Saturday, October 19, 2013 Approximately 8:15 p.m. to 8:35 p.m. Duration: approximately 20 minutes Skies are clear tonight, with a temperature in the mid-50s. Driving from Paloma Creek subdivision in Aubrey, Texas, toward Highway 380 East, we noticed a very bright light hovering in the southern sky.  It was too low to be a star.   We dismissed it at first, thinking it was an airplane, since we are fairly close to DFW airport and see a lot of air traffic.  At one point the light became very bright, as if it was heading directly toward us, then dimmed considerably.   The light was a bright yellow, typical of aircraft, but had no flashing lights.  We eventually turned north onto Dallas Parkway, heading toward Frisco.   The light remained stationary, but we lost track of it shortly after the Warren Parkway exit. It could have been a hovering helicopter, but it was over a darker area (a pasture or a subdivision).  We noticed a lot of other air traffic in the sky this evening, none of which seemed out of the ordinary.  It would be interesting to find out if anyone else noticed what I have described.
