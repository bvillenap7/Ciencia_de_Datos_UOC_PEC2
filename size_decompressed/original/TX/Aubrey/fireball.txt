7 fireball orb type object over N TX on 12/31/13.;2013-12-31 22:00:00;15 minutes;7 fireball orb type object over N TX on 12/31/13 On Wednesday night 12/31/2013 around 10:00 pm CDT, my girlfriend and I saw a series of 7 objects in the sky. It started with these 2 orange/red balls of light/orbs going south to north in Denton County Texas.  The objects stayed at the same altitude and were flying right next to each other, appearing to be in formation. I did not see where they appeared from but we did watch them travel across the sky over about 1 and a half minutes before disappearing. About 2-3 minutes later, 2 more appeared from the south heading on the same path. Again taking about 1-2 minutes before disappearing.  One was on the same course as the first two, and the other headed down and out of sight behind some trees.  I could not tell exactly how far away it was but seemed to be about a half mile to a mile to the west of my location.  I was able to get a video of that one on my phone, but it was pretty dark so there isnâ€™t any perspective to the video.  After the first 4, I went inside and got my 2 sons to come out and they witnessed the last 3 objects we saw.  These all came one at a time.  Took about the same amount of time to travel across the sky and all disappeared around the same area as the first 3 that were going south to north.  They all seemed to be following the same flight path and appeared about 2-3 minutes apart. We waited and watched for more but that was all we saw that night.  This all took place over a period of about 15-20 minutes.  I have no idea what they may have been, but the consensus among us all was that they were not any sort of aircraft we had ever seen. Nor were they any type of firework.  I am happy to send the video but doubt it would provide any clarification.;33.2908;-96.9904999999999
