I was outside after dark on my patio. Looking straight east at a distance I observed a bright white light, circular in shape, but no blinking lights like a plane would have. It was approaching at a speed that allowed me to go inside briefly for my phone/camera. The video I took appears to show a spinning object, quite bright. I tried to zoom in several times which made the object appear to be rapidly changing directions. This was not the case however. It continued east to west at a fairly steady rate. I do see aircraft regularly but this was definitely different.;33.2908;-96.9904999999999
