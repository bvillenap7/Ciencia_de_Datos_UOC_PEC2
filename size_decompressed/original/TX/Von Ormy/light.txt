Lighted object on south-to-north trajectory, traveling over south central (San Antonio) Texas;2014-08-02 21:20:00;10-15 seconds;Lighted object on south-to-north trajectory, traveling over south central (San Antonio) Texas Object was traveling from south to north.  It did not have any strobing lights or sound, just a solid light.  Faster than ordinary aircraft, but it was not streaking across the sky.  Object maintained a steady pace across the sky.   I reported this to a friend in Boerne (former NASA employee) who went outside and also saw the object.  Her son said that it appeared to be a satellite (this object was traveling much faster than any satellite that I have ever seen) which DO have a south to north trajectory which, I guess, can be verified with some gov't agency.;29.2761;-98.6632
