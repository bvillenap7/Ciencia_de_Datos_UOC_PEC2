At first thought it resembled a flock of birds . Until it began to change shape rapidly . It made no noise and gained altitude very quick and then formed into a solid shape of either a egg or circular object . there were many small objects cirling one larger object . Almost like a bunch of guards protecting a mothership . It was really kind of creepy . It wasnt any kind of aircraft that i know of . It first was seen by me in the northwest and was at a heading of south east . It was first seen as many objects and left the area as a soild object .  And as i said it was first seen as 5 to 9 small objects and left the area as one soilid object .  And each object joined the large object one after another in some sort of uniformed fashion .  All the objects one at a time joined the large object until they were one . they were in a somewhat clear sky on the evening of october 12 2011;31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
