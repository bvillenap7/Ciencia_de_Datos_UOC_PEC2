Oval shaped aluminum colored object spotted in broad day light and dissapeared;2010-10-12 12:30:00;5min.;Oval shaped aluminum colored object spotted in broad day light and dissapeared My fiance and myself were driving in broad day light when we spotted the oval shape craft in the sky.  The object was not but maybe 400 yards off the ground and about the same distance away or maybe less.  There was not a cloud in the sky.  The object did not move and remained stationary. It was the color of aluminum. We kept our eyes on it the entire time and then in vanished out of no where. The craft did not fly up or to the side in the sky...it just dissapeared.   I pulled the car over and got out of the car thinking I would see it somewhere in the sky but it was gone.  After looking around I then looked directly above me.  Above me there appeared a flock of birds in a circular pattern just hovering above my car about 50 yards in the sky.  Everything around us seemed very still.  The birds were the size of hawks and had white bellies and black wings...I have never seen these birds in Waco ever.  Not only that, they were not moving.  It was very strange. I got bac! k in my car drove down the street for a bit, looked out my window up in the sky and they were still hovering directly above us...drove a little bit more and the birds were gone.  Don't know if that had any correlation with the craft in the sky, but a strange experience none the less. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
