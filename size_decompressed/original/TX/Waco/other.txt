I WAS OUTSIDE SMOKING A CIGAR EARLY IN THE MORNING WHEN I NOTICE WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A VERY BRIGHT STAR.  THIS STAR WAS JUST TO THE LEFT;2002-12-06 06:07:00;7 minuets;((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the planet, Venus, would have to be ruled out first, before we address the possibility of a UFO.  PD)) I WAS OUTSIDE SMOKING A CIGAR EARLY IN THE MORNING WHEN I NOTICE WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A VERY BRIGHT STAR.  THIS STAR WAS JUST TO THE LEFT OF ANOTHER STAR.  THIS WAS VERY STRANGE TO ME, SO I WENT INSIDE TO GET MY CAMCORDER.  IT WAS VERY COLD THIS MORNING WHILE I WAS RECORDING THIS OBJECT.  I LOCATED THIS OBJECT AND BEGIN TO FILM.  I THEN ZOOMED IN ON THE OBJECT TO FIND THAT IT WAS VERY LARGE AND HAD A UNUSUAL SHAPE.  THE OBJECT WAS FLAT ON THE TOP AND BOTTON, WHILE IT WAS VERY ROUND ON BOTH SIDES.  IT HAD TWO DARK CIRCULAR SPOTS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OBJECT.  I THEN WENT BACK INTO THE HOUSE, BECAUSE OF THE COLD WEATHER.  MINUETS LATER, MY WIFE HAD RETURNED FROM HER DAILY WALK AT THE HOSPITAL TRACK.  I THEN ASKED HER TO COME AND LOOK AT THIS VERY BRIGHT OBJECT IN THE SKY.  SHE ASKED ME WAS THIS A STAR, I REPLIED THAT I DID'NT REALLY KNOW WHAT IT WAS.  I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED HER TO LOOK AT THE RECORDING OF THIS OBJECT.  HER IMMEDIATE REPLY WAS OH MY GOD WHAT IS THAT.  AFTER THE CONVERSATION, I WENT TO RECORD THE OBJECT AGAIN.  UPON RECORDING THE OBJECT, I COULDN'T GET THE CLOSE UP IMAGE THAT I RECORDED THE FIRST TIME.  IT WAS LIKE THE OBJECT HAD MOVED FURTHER AWAY.  I HAVE SHOWN THIS TAPE TO OTHERS AND THEY ARE AMAZED.;31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
Three different single-color lights, red, green, and blue, each flashed once in the pattern of an opening Japanese-style fan.;2008-06-14 00:24:00;seconds;Three different single-color lights, red, green, and blue, each flashed once in the pattern of an opening Japanese-style fan. The object appeared just above the trees at my apartment complex.  I was facing north. It brightly flashed three lights, one after the other, each in the shape of Japanese-style fans rapidly opening.   The lights were green, blue, and red, but I do not remember which order they flashed in.  They flashed only once, then disappeared.  They seemed very close - maybe twenty yards away from me.  I am a skeptic, and do not believe in extraterrestrial visitation here on earth, but maybe this information will be useful to you.  I am a college student with a strong background in science, military hardware, and UFO/extraterrestrial debunking.   This incident does not fit anything I know of either man-made or natural, nor does it fit any description of UFOs which I have ever heard.  Best of luck.
