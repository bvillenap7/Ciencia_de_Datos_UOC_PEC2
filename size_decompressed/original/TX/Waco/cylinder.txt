Burning fire tube.;1998-06-03 17:30:00;2 minutes;Burning fire tube. A friend and I were driving to Amarillo,TX, from Waco, TX.  About 5:30 in the evening we noticed a bright something in the sky.  It looked light a burning, wobbling tube of fire.  We had time to pull over and watch it streak across the sky for a few seconds before it disappeared or burned up. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to be quite sober-minded and sincere about the several sightings she though she had had, during her lifetime.  This is one of seven reports she submitted.  PD));31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
