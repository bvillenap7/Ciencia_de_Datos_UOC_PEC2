I was in pool and my wife was sitting on the edge.;2018-06-15 01:00:00;2 minute;I was in pool and my wife was sitting on the edge. We heard a sound to the southwest.  It sound like a jet type engine, but not a plane.  Then a circular object came over the trees of our back yard at what I would say would be a helicopter type height, but it was not a helicopter. It didn't sound like a jet or a helicopter, but it was a jet type sound. It moved slowly in a northeast direction and hovered directly over our pool for about 5 to 10 seconds and then continued to slowly continue. When it was above we could see what looked like two jet type engines at the back of the craft facing in a downward direction then they rotated back some and it continued moving slowly until it was out of site due to the roof of our house. We were both looking in amazement and didn't think to grab my phone to video until it had almost cleared the house and you really could see anything on the video since I tried to take the video so fast. We live near Space X, which is the general direction it came from and are about 35 minutes from Ft. Hood army base.  So we thought maybe it might be an experimental craft. I am so mad at myself for not immediately grabbing my phone. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he corrected the date to 2018.  He seemed to us to be quite sober-minded, and we suspect that he and his wife probably are very capable and reliable witnesses.  PD));31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
