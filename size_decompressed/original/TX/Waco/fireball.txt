Strange ball of white light  travelling over Waco;2008-01-01 20:00:00;5 seconds;Strange ball of white light  travelling over Waco Driving from San Antonio to Dallas one evening, I happened to look out of my passenger side window and noticed a ball of light travelling through the sky. It looked like a falling star but much much larger and glowing bright white. I thought it could have been a comet at first except for the fact that the comet dust in its wake was not what I'd seen before with comets. The dust looked like sparks flying off the ball of white light. The object was much closer to the earth's atmosphere than a comet would be and it was travelling at about the same speed as a commercial aircraft. I observed it for several seconds before it moved out of my sphere of vision. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to  provide no contact information.  PD));31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
