Possible planes on fire;2008-10-28 19:45:00;1 minute;Possible planes on fire October 28, 2008 8:15pm  Waco, Texas 76712  Skies Clear  Temperature 55 F  Winds: 0 mph  Humidity: 36%     On Oct. 28, 2008 at around 7:45pm, I Was sitting on front porch drinking coffee with room mate and happen to glance over towards west and directly under what I believe to be Mars was a rectangular object that appeared to be on fire. It burned for a second and flashed out and re appeared to the right (in my measurements of the space between an inch if you held a ruler to the night sky) of it and burned for another second. While that object burned the first object reappeared to the left of the 2nd object and then the 2nd object flashed out, followed by the 1st object and then the 2nd object reappeared and flashed out and then nothing.  My room mate saw the last flash, because he couldnâ€™t see what I was looking at, until he stood up.  Because this all happen right above the horizon of tree tops. My first impression was a plane was on fire and then when the 2nd object appeared and looked to be on fire.  My impression was a dogfight of some sorts.  I am not sure what it was. It was interesting to say the least.  I cannot tell if it was over Waco or not, It may have been passed Waco.  I cannot say how far away it was, but all I can say is it was as big if not bigger than an American Eagle jet.;31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
Rotating rectangular metallic object sighted by 6 witnesses for 7-8 minutes.;2011-08-17 14:00:00;7-8 min.;Rotating rectangular metallic object sighted by 6 witnesses for 7-8 minutes. I stepped outside of work facing east at 2:00pm on 8-17-2011.  I looked  towards the horizon line and saw a rectangular  metallic shape rotating end over end in the sky.  I watched it move from the horizon line up into the sky.  I went inside and called my co-workers & bosses to come see it. When we went outside it had moved farther into the sky, but you could still make out the shape and that it was rotating. 6 people, including myself, watched move farther away towards the upper atmosphere in a northwardly direction.   The total amount of time the object was visible was 7-8 minutes.;31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
