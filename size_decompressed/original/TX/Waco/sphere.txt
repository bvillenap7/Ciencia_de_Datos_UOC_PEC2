Glowing blue orb about 4 feet diameter hovers above ground.;1975-06-01 01:00:00;2 minutes;Glowing blue orb about 4 feet diameter hovers above ground. One night in 1975 I was trying to go to sleep when every dog in the neighborhood was barking or howling and then my dog who sleeps with me began to growl.  I got up to see if there was something outside.  I went out my back door and walked around to the corner of the house.  My bedroom extends out in an l shape.  As I turned the corner I could see a blue glow.  When I could completely turn the corner I saw a round object about 3 or 4 feet diameter floating off the ground about 2 feet.  The object had no visible material, just the blue glow . I would call it a blue L E D .  At the time in 1975 I didn’t know about L E D.  it was visible for only about 20 seconds and I was shocked.   This was in the country on a gravel road with empty lots on both sides and a pasture in back.  No street lights.  My dog and I went back to bed.  The next morning I called a tv station and asked if they had heard of anything unusual in Timbercrest.  He said no, why?  I hung up!  It disappeared after about 20 seconds.;31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
I saw a hazy blue ball of light about four feet in diameter just off the ground.;1976-06-01 23:00:00;4 seconds;I saw a hazy blue ball of light about four feet in diameter just off the ground. I was waked up one night by my dog barking and could hear every dog in the neighborhood barking.  I finally got up to take a look outside and saw a beautiful blue ball of light just above the ground in my yard.   It didn’t have a definite shape, just a soft glow of light.   I saw it for only about four or five seconds but that was long enough then it just disappeared.   My little dog was with me and we went back inside and went to bed but I didn’t sleep much that night.   The next day I called the television stations to see if anything had been reported but they said no and I wouldn’t give them my name.  I’ve only told a few people about this because it makes no sense.   I lived in the country where there weren’t any lights so it couldn’t have been any kind of reflection.   The next morning I went out to look at the place where the blue ball had been and my little dog ran over to sniff the ground.  I wasn’t dreaming and I don’t drink.  This has puzzled me for many years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date.  PD));31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
I saw a beam of blue light as I watched the other UFO zip through the sky;2020-04-22 08:48:00;3 minutes;I saw a beam of blue light as I watched the other UFO zip through the sky I was coming home from getting food and my street was super dark and I’m obsessed with the stars and been praying to see a UFO! Today was my lucky day my dreams came true!! I looked up and saw this aircraft zooming so fast through sky and I knew it wasn’t a plane! Planes cannot move like this! I just kept watching it, next thing I know, a little closer a ufo flashed across the sky closer to me like it felt like the other ufo acknowledged me by flashing by and disappearing quickly! I’ve really been wishing to meet a Pleidian but once the blue craft with blue light came by closer I took off running into my mom house! Guess I wasn’t as ready as I assumed! But, I have literally been looking at the skies for 2 weeks saying please I want to see a UFO! I believed and gave it energy! The human race is under surveillance absolutely!!! No doubt in my mind!!!;31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
