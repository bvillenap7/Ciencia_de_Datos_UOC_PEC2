mama ship drops off baby ship;1997-05-15 20:00:00;1 minute;mama ship drops off baby ship I was sitting in my front yard with my son  and his friends who were teens at the time. I noticed what I thought was a falling star. The star, instead of burning out as normal stopped right in the middle of the sky and a green object came out and flew across the sky faster than anything that could possibly be human. It disappeared on the horizon and mind you this thing started in the middle of the sky and took 10 seconds to reach the horizon and disappear.

Lights flying around the moon.;1997-10-03 21:30:00;1 minute or more;Lights flying around the moon. I was looking up at the moon on a clear night.  I saw 3 lights CIRCLING THE MOON at great speed!!!!  One light was red, one was white or yellow, and one was green.  The 3 lights looked liked they were in a race around the moon, and I saw them circle the moon at least 3-4 times!!!  The lights looked like moving stars.  It was not Shooting stars or a meteor either! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to be quite sober-minded and sincere about the several sightings she though she had had, during her lifetime.  This is one of seven reports she submitted.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
Dim light at high altitude moving quite fast seen to reverse course.;2002-10-16 20:45:00;15 minutes;Dim light at high altitude moving quite fast seen to reverse course. Dim light at high altitude traveling in a north weasterly direction at high speed. I thought it was a satilight at first because of it apparent high altitude and it straight track. As We lost the light in the haze about ten degrees above the horizon, it suddenly reversed its direction and traveled back to the portion of the sky where it was first observed. It them became stationary for abut three minutes and then would make short jumps at high speed in what apeared to be random directions. These jumps were aprox. three time the width of my thumb held at arms length. There was some variation this continued intill we lost sight of the object due to haze or high clouds moving in about fifteen minutes after first seeing the object. There was also commercial jet activity at altitude as well as one brief meteor burn. All were clearly different from what we observed. ((NUFORC Note:  If the estimate of direction of travel is correct, the object could not have been a satellite.  Orbiting satellites almost never have a westerly component to their direction of travel.  Please see similar report from Portland, Oregon, for the same date.  PD));31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606

On the evening of 09/06/05 i was doing some stargazing.At exactly 9:17pm i was looking at the north star(polaris)and noticed a silver blue spec of light descending on the eastern side of polaris,as the descent continued the color changed from bluish to a redish orange.Once the craft passed polaris it stopped and was glowing a very bright orange.It stayed stationary for about 10 seconds and appeared to be cooling off because the color began to change back to the silver blue.After 10 seconds the craft proceded off in a northwesterly direction (310 degrees)at a very high rate of speed and faded from sight.my wife and daughter both seen it!this event repeated itself for the next three(3)nights.i called my brother and his wife over on 09/08/05 to witnees the event which happened at 9:17pm for four nights in a row! the 5th night was cloudy and we could not see anything at all.It seemed like a re-entry procedure of sorts!military ufo maybe,who knows.;31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
bright blue/turqoiuse colored light , lights up the whole lower level of the sky for apprx. 1 sec.  ((Meteor??));2005-11-14 20:15:00;1  second;bright blue/turquoise colored light, lights up the whole lower level of the sky for apprx. 1 sec. My wife and I were travling south on hwy 31 outside of Waco.  At apprx.8:15 pm a bright blue/turqoiuse colored light lit up the whole lower level of sky in at least 180 degrees, I couldnt see behind us at the time so I dont know if it was any further around us.  I've never believed in the whole u.f.o. thing but this was the strangest thing I have seen.  It almost seemed as if there was a nuclear explosion somwhere in the distance, though I have never witnessed one, obviously, you can kind of get the idea from tv.  I wish one of these smart scientist fellers could explain this one to me.   Oh and by the way I'm in the Army and I know it wasn't anything  Army related.  Nothing on Ft. Hood can do that.;31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
Steady, bright white light in sky over Waco, TX;2007-06-10 22:41:00;1-2 minutes;Steady, bright white light in sky over Waco, TX Last night (6/10/07) I was sitting outside at a club, just listening to my fiancee's band play and looking at the night sky.  I observed a single, bright white light very high in the sky, traveling east to west in a straight line.  At first I thought it could be a plane, but it was only one steady light and traveling faster than a normal aircraft.  I could see a few stars in the sky and it was slightly larger than the stars.  I didn't point it out to anyone else, even though there were a few people seated near me.  The music was quite loud, and I would have had to shout.  I watched it until my view was obstructed by trees. The sky was very clear, and as I said, I could see some stars even though the club is located in a very well-lit commercial area near Interstate 35. A bit later I saw a plane headed in the same direction, and I could clearly see the familiar lights on it. I suppose it could've been a satelitte, but I'm not sure what they look like in the night sky.;31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
5 balls of white light appeared hovering in the sky;2010-07-01 10:00:00;5;5 balls of white light appeared hovering in the sky While driving on highway 6 heading towards Speegleville, TX, my wife and I witnessed 5 balls of very bright white lights seemingly hovering in the sky.  At first, one single white light ball appeared and then 4 more balls of light identical to the first spread out evenly to the right of the original light in a horizontal pattern, then the lights disappeared.  It was as if each ball of light was standing behind the other, but then each successive light moved sideways to the right in an equidistant pattern until there were 5, all evenly spaced apart.  These balls of light did not move and the lights eventually disappeared after a short period of about 5 -10 seconds.  The way these lights were hovering in the sky, and not moving, did not seem natural.;31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
Light shooting across sky, change direction, then fade with other;2014-12-12 07:00:00;1:00;light shooting across sky, change direction, then fade with other Walking down the road i saw a shooting star.  Then a few mins later i saw another, after the second i saw what i thought was a star, it didn't fade it didnt lose shape just kept moving, the light kept a speed faster to the planes u unusually see at night, it also had no other lights onn it, it changed direction at the snap of fingers, kept moving till my eeyes lost track, but as i was loosing sight a notherof the same lights started moving in another direction, i paused trying to keep track of both, in doing soi lost them entirely.  Looked like star a light but didnt move like one, didnt pulse, moved till it blended inn too the black,  like as if moving away, after i lost track of them then i waited too see if they would reshow them selves, but i did see another shooting star,;31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
Star like light zipped around in the sky above us;2015-09-06 03:00:00;14 minutes;Star like light zipped around in the sky above us we thought it was a shooting star at first.  It was a light that appeared in the sky.  It zipped around us like a Roman candle, four times.  Then the sky lit up to the left of it, purple an pink at the same time the electricity went off all around the RV park.  The electricity came right back on.  The wind began to blow.  The radar stated there were no storms anywhere near our location.  The light in the sky came on like a a headlight.  Then turned off just as quick as it lit up.  It moved over an did the same thing 5 more times before it finally shot up an disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Intelligent Orb.;2020-05-24 23:15:00;1 minute;Intelligent Orb On 05/25/2020 at approximately 23:15 I witnessed a softball sized orb flashing in the backyard of my residence.  At a distance I assumed the flashing was a lightning bug.  As the orb approached the window I was observing it stopped moving and started glowing with a blueish white light.  At this point it stayed stationary for a few seconds right in front of me. At this time there was a thunderstorm approximately twenty miles from my location so I assumed this was just ball lightning.  Then a bright beam of white fast flickering light appeared and scanned from my feet to my head.  Once it reached the top of the window frame the flickering light stopped and the glowing object shot up and exited my field of vision.;31.5474882268482;-97.1548910265606
