Low bright flashing lights, sound of car low idleing;2003-09-10 04:38:00;10sec;Low bright flashing lights, sound of car low idleing I was unable to sleep, it was about 4:30 am and I was working on the computer, when I heard what sounded like a car idleing in front of my house.  We live on the end of the street, and cars often turn around in our driveway late at night.  The car sounded like it was stopped outside our house, which concerned me, so I went into the living room (which was dark) to look outside.  When I did I saw 2 flashing lights about a 45 degree angle in the sky, flashing rapidly, with the lights being  about 20 degrees apart.  They were very bright, and unlike anything I'd seen, which frightened me, so I went to wake up my husband.  When he looked out the window, he saw the lights, but by now they were flashing closer together, but were moving away at a very fast speed.  They were moving east, with the lights flashing in a north/south direction.  I never saw a car.  We watched the next night to see if it could have been a plane, but as low as the lights were the plane would have woke everyone in the neighborhood.  I have never seen anything so unusual.;32.7608103197676;-97.783546656977
