Lights were not in an exact formation, there were some in a cluster towards the north end of the whole group. My daughter and husband stepped out of the front door on the east side of our home to take care of some chores, they noticed the line of lights in the sky moving west, on the west side of Weatherford, Texas to the East side of Mineral Wells, Texas. until they could no longer be seen. (approx. 5-8 minutes) The lights did not flash and never heard a sound.  No type of engine noise.  We stayed outside just watching the sky for another 5 or so minutes, and that is when we noticed and low flying pulsing light, the closer it got it almost looked like many lights within one sphere. It moved slow enough for us to focus on but fast enough to be moving on, only took about two to three minutes to move in past our home, just to the south of our home ! over our neighbors pasture.  It was higher than the tree line, but not as high as a helicopter would fly. This light also made no noise.  There weather was clear, no clouds.;32.7608103197676;-97.783546656977

It was meteor fast, but seemed to be in the clouds, which obscured the sky in that direction.  I was facing northeast, towards Fort Worth.  I live just south of Weatherford, TX.  It was much larger than an airplane light and was noticeably green.  I am a hospital pharmacist working a 2:30-11 pm shift.  It was so bright that it caught my attention.   Iâ€™ve never seen anything like that before.;32.7608103197676;-97.783546656977
