While watching the dogs outside I noticed a very bright light that seemed to be coming towards my home from about 10 to 15 miles away. I thought nothing of it until it started drifting slowly up then down then around but generally in the same spot. It began quickly flashing orange lights then dimmed into the darkness but quickly lit up again w/a bright white light. It continued w/this flashing pattern for the duration of the event. It never got any closer or further away until about 6 a.m. then it slowly lowered below the treeline out of sight. I woke my husband after watching it for the 1st min. or so. He was intregued enough to watch the entire event. The event occured in the western sky at varying distances above the neighborhood treeline. We couldn't detect a shape for sure. Only flashing lights that seemed to surround the object.;32.7608103197676;-97.783546656977
