Re-entry moving W, W of Weatherford, TX.;2019-09-05 07:30:00;30 seconds;Reentry moving west , West of Weatherford TX On September 5 at around 7:30 am, I was watering my front yard and noticed a bright white strike to the south west, at a very steep angle of attack.  I had thought that it was a meteor.  I went to the top of my yard to keep it in sight and the strike shrank to what looks like a flame coming out of a white cylinder and that was as long as, my thumb nail is wide at armâ€™s length.  As the Trail shrank the object leveled off and moving west.  The tail disappeared and only the white cylinder was visible as it moved, so the house across the street obstructed my view.  No photos were taken it happened too fast.;32.7608103197676;-97.783546656977
