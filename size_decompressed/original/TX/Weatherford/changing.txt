I turned and looked and saw what appeared to be one or more craft heading in a southery direction. It looked as though it was one craft with two others circling the main one. It could have been just one as the distance involved (and I'm not sure)could have been anywhere from 1/4 mile to a mile although it was a clear day no wind and modert tempture outside. This craft made no engine noise left no vapor trail and the speed it seemed to travel was not slow but not fast. It also appered to be about 1200 to 1500 feet in the air as it traveled it seemed to be gaining altitude very slowely as it headed south. It was very shiney as it rotated alternetly changing from light to dark surfaces there were no lights that could be seen. As for my friend and myself we are not druggies nor drunks and not prone to jokes about this and he does not know I am filing this report. He is ex miltary and we he is in his mid 40s and I'm in my mid 50s so no joke folks we saw it ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.7608103197676;-97.783546656977
