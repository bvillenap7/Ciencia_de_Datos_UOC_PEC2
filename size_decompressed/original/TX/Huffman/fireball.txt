When I first noticed something strange coming over the tree line from our North, I said look at that and my friend said, that's just a plane.  I said I don't know what it is but I don't think it's a plane, it wasn't very high but somewhere about where planes fly, we live close to an airport so it could have been, but then as it passed over head another one of these what looked like a fire ball came from the same direction and pattern than the first one and then another and another about 6 or 6 in all, as they got overhead they seemed to elevate out of sight.   My friend was able to take a picture with his cell phone and sent it to the local news channel where there had been numerous reports from others in the close surrounding, maybe within 25 miles or so from where we were. Some had said it may have been Chinese lanterns from a wedding in the area but I don't think they were, they were pretty high and looked too big to be a little lantern.
