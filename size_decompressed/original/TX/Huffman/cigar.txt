He said yes and told me that he was watching it for about 10 seconds.   The craft then shot up and over to the right then dropped behind some trees.   We were thinking it was a plane but about a minute later an airplane flew by and we could tell perfectly that it wasn't plane.   The plane was a passenger plane it wasn't any type of jet.;30.0534;-95.1027
