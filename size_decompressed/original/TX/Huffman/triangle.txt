Last night I was driving home after playing  bunko on FM 1485 East.  As I hit the curve after crossing the East Fork of the San Jacinto River I looked up over the trees and saw a large triangular shaped object in the sky.  It was covered in white lights that were not symmetric in the traingle.  I did not believe I saw it, so I looked again and it was still there.  As I preceded down the road the trees hide the object for a while.  Then I caught a glimpse of it but it had shifted directions and its side was facing me.  The side was rectangular and the outermost lights were white, then there were two green lights, and in the center there was red light. At that point I noticed a plane flying around the area in a circlular pattern.;30.0534;-95.1027
