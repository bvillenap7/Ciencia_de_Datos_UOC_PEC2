I was walking towards the science building in my University, and took a shorcut through a small field in between sidewalks. At this moment I started glancing as the stars and the moon, as it is at its brightest today.  I first noticed a very small, faint cigar shaped object going by at a relatively steady speed in between two stars, my first thought was it being a satellite, and instantly told my girlfriend who was walking with me to look upwards, she had some trouble seeing it as the object was relatively above us, and there were no objects in the ground to help give an idea of its precise location.  After a few seconds she managed to get a small look at it, before her eyes gave way and got teary, making her look away and loose sight of the object.  It was at this time that I first noticed a very disturbing behavior in the object as it made a very small zig zag across the sky, and then proceeded to join about five or so objects in a kind of formation, these! other objects appeared to have suddenly emerged as this happened or maybe my sight was so fixed upon the amazing maneouver the  first object had just made. All the objects dissapeared within a couple of seconds and then suddenly reappeared for a few seconds more before I lost sight of them for good.;26.2967073111289;-98.1835041429727
