((anonymous report));2018-05-24 13:00:00;25 seconds;Fumbled for my phone as a silver daylight sphere was crossing east to west right in front of me.  Seemed to have cloaked on the photos. Driving north on Jackson, maybe 10 blocks from Trenton Rd.  Saw a metallic sphere and fumbled for my camera, but it seemed to late but I took a few pics anyways thinking maybe it cloaked.  Didn't check the images till way latter and to my surprise after a little enhancing there were two sphere like objects I caught.
