Gracefully floating orange orb in Texas;2011-01-08 01:05:00;2 MINUTES;Gracefully floating orange orb in Texas I am located in Edinburg, Texas. South part of Texas in the Rio Grand Valley.  And on this night 1/8/2011 at approximately 1:05A.M., I was outside sitting with family facing East when I noticed through my neighbors trees a bright orange glowing light.  And I could see it so bright through the branches of the trees and I knew right away it was no plane or anything like that.  My family members saw my face of “aww” and I finally said turn around!  And we all got up and moved away from the trees to be able to get a full view, it was only 500ft-1000ft away from us and it was this ball of glowing orange light, fire like just gracefully floating across the sky, we had perfect view of it (and it was no meteor either I’ve seen that before) heading Northwest with no sound at all. It was completely silent.  My husband even said at one point “Is that an angel?” over and over again. Because it was nothing we had ever seen and we had perfect view of it!   My family kept saying, “! Get the camera!” but I was not going to miss out on what I was seeing!  I eventually rushed inside to get it and only got 2 sec of very poor quality video. We followed it to the front of our yard were we saw it keep traveling and even though it was already far it was still in sight and then it just disappeared.   I immediately (literally 2 minutes later) contacted the National UFO Reporting Center to tell my story because sometimes things like this get ignored and I want to let the world know what I saw and it was real.  I have no doubt in my mind that this orb was UFO related.  And I feel so lucky to have been able to see something you hear about on T.V.  And I hope that this can be explained.;26.2967073111289;-98.1835041429727
