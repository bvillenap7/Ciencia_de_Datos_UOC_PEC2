Two stationary bright shiny objects seen above Edinburg, Texas.;2009-03-02 15:10:00;15 min approx;Two stationary bright shiny objects seen above Edinburg, Texas. March 2, 2009  At approximately 3:10 P.M. on March 2, 2009, while sitting outside our back patio with my wife, I spotted a bright shiny object directly east in the sky.  At first, I thought it was a star, but it had a silvery shine to it, so I ran to get my camera and binoculars.  As I first saw the object with my binoculars, I could tell that the stationary object was not a plane, or anything that I have ever seen.  It was about two hands above the horizon directly East from my location. My wife is a witness to the incident. The object remained stationary for about 10 minutes.  At this point I tried to take some pictures but could not find the object in the viewfinder so I just randomly took some pictures in the hope of capturing the object.  I was not successful. The object then began to move NWN and made a 45-degree travel in a matter of about 30 seconds and then disappeared behind some clouds.  About two minutes later, my wife spotted another similar bright shiny object. This second object was about three hands above the horizon and SE from our location.  I saw the object with my binoculars and it had the same configurations as the first object.  After a couple of minutes clouds covered the object and when the clouds cleared, the object was nowhere to be seen.  I tried looking for it but could not find it anywhere. About 15 minutes later a twin-engine propeller plane flew a route of east to north, exactly the same route the object took but at a lower altitude.;26.2967073111289;-98.1835041429727
