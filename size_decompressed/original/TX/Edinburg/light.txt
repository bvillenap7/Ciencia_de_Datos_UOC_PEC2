At this/that time viewing the objects, they were seen at approx. 1 min. appart. The objects were comming from the South Southeast heading towards the Northwest.  As it came in just above me, the object made a Northern turn then it started to dim its lights.  This accured with the first 3 objects.  But the 4th object came in from the Northwest heading towards the Southeast.  This object also started to dim its lights. This is not the first time I had seen an object do this.  As a matter a fact it was totaly the opposit.  In 1990 at approx. 5:05 a.m., (at that time we had a full moon presint)  a strange object came about from the South.  The object would be about the hight of a tower with red lights blinking so that the plains would not fly so low.  Before the object took off,  it turned on its lights before it shot itself into space.  Apporox.  10-15 min. later, another object did the same thing. It was like as if they were checking us out doing undercover work. If you are interested in finding out more information as to how I know that I was obducted,  then let me know withing my e-mail address... (END);26.2967073111289;-98.1835041429727
