Object hovers over house in populated neighborhood.;2002-03-13 21:00:00;20 min.;Object hovers over house in populated neighborhood. My wife and I were relaxing on our back patio around 9pm on the evening in question. My wife had asked why a helicopter would land off of Mimosa st-{ just a few blocks away}. When I looked to see what she was talking about I saw an object approximately 150 feet in the air and slowly descending. I would have thought it was a helicopter as well except that it made no sound and the light from what would be a spotlight was more of a greenish color than white. It continued its' descent until it was about at the roofline of the house behind us on Cherrywood and it appeared to be dull grayish in color and the shape of a football with the ends mashed in. It hovered for what seemed like around 10 more minutes and then it tilted and shot awy at a speed I have not seen any helicopter fly at before. I am hoping to find out if anyone else may have seen or reported anything that eve. as this is my first visit to this website. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
