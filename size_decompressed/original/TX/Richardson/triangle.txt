Triangle Craft With Intemittent White Green and Red lights;2011-06-25 23:48:00;45 Minutes;Triangle Craft With Intemittent White Green and Red lights I was out on the back porch having a smoke.  I noticed that there was two constant lights the one to the south was brighter than the one to the north.   There was a vague triangular silhouette of the craft and an intermittent red white and green flashing light pointing to the west.  It appeared to be rotating slowly at about 25 Degrees per minute in a clockwise direction.   From my vantage point the craft was at a true north bearing of 255.  The wind was blowing out of the south east.   It had gained in altitude from 30 degrees above the horizon at the beginning of the sighting and had risen to approximately 55 degrees from the horizon before disheartening.   I made several calls asking for people to look for the craft for an attempt to triangulate it's position they all refused. One peson 13 miles north did not see the craft, however that is in a brightly lit area.   The craft faded out around 00:35.  I am using local landmarks to give the approximate distance from me to! the object at 3-6 miles.;32.951386013986;-96.7090108073734
First time to observe such an object in the sky;2012-04-23 21:00:00;60-80 seconds;First time to observe such an object in the sky Fast flying object travelling from south to north parallel along plano road. Object lights emitting a yellow, orange colour. Observer was sitting in his backyard looking for satellites in the sky at this time.;32.951386013986;-96.7090108073734
3 triangular shaped craft - flying in V-formation from West to East, just North of Dallas Texas, and the night sky was very clear;2016-12-19 01:27:00;<1 minute;3 triangular shaped craft - flying in V-formation from West to East, just North of Dallas Texas, and the night sky was very clear 01:26am or 01:27am, today on December 19, 2016. I saw my first UFO's in my lifetime, it was interesting. (I am 53 years of age)  3 relatively small triangular shaped craft - flying in formation from West to East, and witnessed them as I was standing in my front yard. (just North of Dallas Texas, and the night sky was very clear)  They emitted just a faint/low white light, and their formation was close together and smooth. They were all the same size and shape, and traveled in a somewhat close together V-formation - although their close proximity to each other had slight lateral variance as they were traveling. They were completely silent and traveling quite swiftly and much faster than commercial aircraft - approximately twice the speed. The trailing/back edge of these triangular crafts indented slightly in their shape. All of the leading and end points on these craft were slightly rounded. I guessed them around 10,000 ft. altitude. My first personal estimate on these UFO's is that they are U.S. technology. When I first noticed them from further away, I thought it was marker lights from a lower flying commercial jet airplane. I actually am grateful and feel privileged that I saw them.;32.951386013986;-96.7090108073734
