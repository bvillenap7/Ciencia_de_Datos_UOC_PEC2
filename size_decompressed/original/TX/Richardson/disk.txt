Solid white disc raced across the sky and traveled due south, very fast. The entire event happened within approximately thirty seconds. This was NOT a meteor or burning star! It was very defined in it's path. I have seen meteor showers and this was a totally different experience.;32.951386013986;-96.7090108073734
