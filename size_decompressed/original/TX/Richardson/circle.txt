Last night, while reading in my living room two and a half small disks emerged in front of my eyes as I read. At first, I thought it was just a reflection. Then, I observed the one reflection be repeated into two and then into two and a half, like a type of mitosis or meosis in biology. I continued to read and the clear lenses stayed in front of my eyes. They were less than an inch each. They did not seem to come from anywhere in particular. When I looked at them closely, I could see the movement of cell-type activity. It was very unusual. I sat up further and attempted to permeate the two and a half disks. Then, I backed up again to read and I could see that they were still there. Eventually, after several minutes, they disappeared. They didn't really travel or move as an entity. The insides however, were pulsing with cell-type movement. There were silver-grey outlines inside the lens-type spheres.;32.951386013986;-96.7090108073734
