Black metallic sphere hovers over major highway;2011-06-11 15:00:00;Less than one minute;Black metallic sphere hovers over major highway I am not sure of the exact date and time but I believe it was approximately 3-4 pm on June 11, 2011 in Richardson, Texas.    It was a sunny,  clear day.  My wife and I were traveling west on President George Bush Freeway about 1/2 mile from the intersection with Hwy 75. The traffic was very light.  I was traveling about 65 mph.     My wife was reading and my eyes focused on an object that was hovering above the road in front of us.  When I first saw the object I would guess it was between 50 and 100 yards In front of us so we were closing in very fast.  At first I did not say anything assuming that I would identify the object as something normal. But as we got closer I shouted for my wife to look.    My eyes were locked on the object all the way as we passed underneath it.  My wife raised her head up just fast enough to see something but not quickly enough to really see the whole object.  It was just there and appeared to be about 15 feet over the roof of our vehicle as I drove underneath.   It was round.  It was black and  appeared to have a gray and silver sheen to it. I think it was about 4' in diameter.  It was totally still.  It was definitely not a balloon.  It appeared to be metallic.    As we drove underneath I pushed my head as far forward and looked up.  We quickly took the very next exit and went underneath the highway to come back up on the same westbound side to get another look and it was gone.    I read the papers and looked for signs of anyone else reporting this but there was nothing.  I am sure it had to be seen in this highly populated area.   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
