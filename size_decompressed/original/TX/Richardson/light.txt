((NUFORC Note:  Our guess would be a bright, and/or twinkling, star.  PD));32.951386013986;-96.7090108073734
Three lights moving very fast one did a sharp turn that normal planes cannot do and the other two continued to move very quickly.;2005-07-06 22:30:00;20 Seconds;Three lights moving very fast one did a sharp turn that normal planes cannot do and the other two continued to move very quickly. Me and two friends went into the backyard to look at the stars when we saw 3 small very fast moving lights. One of them did a sharp turn and slowed down as it moved passed my house the other two stayed right next to each other  while they moved. Within about 20 seconds they had all disapeared into the night.;32.951386013986;-96.7090108073734
4 lights in sky 10/7/19;2019-10-07 20:15:00;5-10 seconds;4 lights in sky 10/7/19 The sky was pretty clear last night as I was able to see all the stars etc... I was looking up at the sky and noticed 4 very dim lights EXTREMELY high in the sky (you really had to focus to see those 4 lights (50% visible) seemed like they were in space that's how far it looked like they were) and it was moving south I would say.  Those 4 lights were REALLY far apart from each other but symmetrically aligned and was moving diagonal then straight and then again diagonal.  Those 4 lights were in perfect sync with each other and the lights were all horizontal and not a triangular form or anything.  After it passed the moon, they disappeared.  I really was spooked out and had goosebumps.  My buddy did not believe me at all. It's hard for anyone to believe until they see it for themselves and I KNOW WHAT I SAW LAST NIGHT... definitely were not planes or anything,  I am 110% positive as they are more blinking lights and would be one big solid light from down here.  I saw! 4 lights .    .    . like this;32.951386013986;-96.7090108073734
