the light that came as i called it;1969-10-15 19:00:00;1 minute;the light that came as i called it as i stepped out of the lions club hurst texas the sky was clear and the rain was still on the ground .i looked up to see two black helos chasing a white light .my thoughts were of a jail break like david janson of the fugitive a popular tv show of the time.the black helos were traveling north with the white light in front of them.i said in my mind COME HERE .the craft came to me at tree top level and a bright light burned the back of my neck.the water on the ground evaporated in a circle and the person behind me with his foot in the air but not touching the ground as he looked up to the object.fear filled me and i found it difficult to speak.the police officer/security guard had his face and arm sticking out the door of the lions club...i still remember his name.the light made such a sharp turn to get to me the two helos seemed as if they didnt notice and kept going north?time stood still for a moment as everyone was like a statue except me!heat on my neck and a lump in my throat i uttered UUGGHH at that instant everything came back to normal and bob shaking his head saiddid you see that?yeah i replied and he just shook his head and went back inside.at the moment i found my voice the disk went back to the south at tree top level without making a sound.i dont know who the guy was behind me.i continued my walk home afraid to mention the sighting to anyone..still amazed that i called it to me,just by saying COME HERE in my mind.;32.8365489583333;-97.1748140625
