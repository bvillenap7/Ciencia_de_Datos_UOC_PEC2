Triangular shape light in Hurst texas that stayed making small movements for over 2 hours ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD));2003-10-24 01:30:00;2 hours+ and still going ;Triangular shape light in Hurst texas that stayed making small movements for over 2 hours Walking in a local park with someone else at night I noticed some light flickering different colors with an apparent shape to it. We stopped and watched for around 30-50 minutes and noticed planes go past but this object never moved. It appeared to have 3 strip lights making a triangle and a single light underneath, it was a distance off but I could see this shape. Every so often we noticed what appeared to be like a small beam of light appearing underneath it at a slight angle that but it did not reach the ground just a little underneath the object. The lights flickered red, green and yellow I believe but not like that of any plane (we are near an airport so I know what plane lights look like and the airport is off in a different direction).  After a while it started to move a little, but there was no acceleration or deceleration, it just moved left then right a little and then in a sort of s shape upwards. We watched as it would make this movement now and again.  Upon returning home from the park I could still see it from the house and observed it for a long time waiting to see any kind of movement that I could relate to a plane or helicopter. It is important to note that all this time there was no sound other than that of roads nearby and it was very quiet, the event is still on going at this time of writing and am awaiting to see what happens.;32.8365489583333;-97.1748140625
Black triangle, sighted in middle of the day.;2016-07-28 01:00:00;1 minute;Black Triangle Middle of the Day Sighted Large Black Triangle with a strange rusty black color shot passed my window in the middle of the day.   I ran outside to see if I could catch a pic, but it was a small dot on the horizon in only about 5 seconds of delay to get camera and get outside.  It just drifted away very quickly.  Much faster than when it first passed by the picture window.;32.8365489583333;-97.1748140625
