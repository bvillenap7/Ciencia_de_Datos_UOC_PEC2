It disapearedbehind trees.  No sound. I saw this sometime after last Christmas (I washome from Boston University where i graduatedthis May with a BA in psychology) whilestanding on a friend's back porch in Hurst Texas,very near (roughly two miles NW of) the bellhelicopter plant.My friend was with me but did not see it.I noticed it in the western sky. It was a verybright white ball of light which shot straightdown much faster than i've ever seen anythingshoot straight down.  I have no idea how largeit was, but would guess based on theintensity of the light that it was probablyno more than a mile or so away. It disapearedfrom view behind some trees to the west (probablyabout 25 degrees from the horizon where i wasstanding). I heard no sound during or after seeingit.  There was no flash or sound of an explosion,which I would have expected given its speed,trajectory, and apparent proximity when it disapearedfrom view.The sighting lasted no more than a second, but madean impression on me.  I never thought of reportingit until I ran across this web page.I hope it's useful.-((Name and e-mail address deleted))will only be active for another month or two.;32.8365489583333;-97.1748140625
Strange light hovering and watching Fireworks display.;2013-07-04 22:00:00;12 minutes;Strange light hovering and watching Fireworks display. On this date and time,while watching the cities fireworks at the fourth of July festival,  I, my wife and another individual witnessed a bright object hovering close to the level the fireworks were going off at.  The object was very bright and did not make any sound as it would hover about a fourth of a mile from the fireworks, take off with incredible speed then reappear as if watching the fireworks.  This lasted through the duration of the fireworks and when it ended, the object left from a hovering position and took off with incredible speed making no sound.  I am an ex member of the Civil Air Patrol and have been trained to identify aircraft both civilian and military.  With my knowledge of aircraft and Space Science in which I took in College,  I can truly say that what I saw was an unknown aircraft or object to me.              Thank you.;32.8365489583333;-97.1748140625

And a helicopter or something following alongside the right of that with its red blinking lights and one main light.  I saw no other objects or shapes beside the helicopter aircraft.
