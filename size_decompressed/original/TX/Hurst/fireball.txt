Large fireball moving from N-NE to S-SE over the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex;2000-06-12 23:26:00;3 seconds;Large fireball moving from N-NE to S-SE over the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex I observed one very large blue and yellow fireball moving from N-NE to S-SE at 11:26 PM on June 12th, 2000. The fireball's size and shape appeared as that of a tennis ball held at arms length (approximately). It did have a tail, which was approximately the same length as the diameter of the fireball. The duration of the event was about 2-3 senconds, but the fireball was brilliantly lit and appeared to be very close, maybe within 10 miles or so. The object disappeared behind the treeline as it fell toward the horizon. The trees that I'm speaking of are about 120 feet behind my house and about 40 feet tall. The fireball had an electric blue core and a yellow outer shell. I may have these colors backwards, it happened so fast. The shell was about 1/2 the thickness of the fireball. If I had to associate this with anything that I've ever seen before, I would say that it looked like a very large flare. But in my opinion, it was moving far too fast for a flare. I'm a 39 year old Technical Writer for a large telecommunications company in the Dallas area. I have had military experience (in the Army Signal Corps many years ago) and have never witnessed anything like this before.;32.8365489583333;-97.1748140625
Bright white fireball moving from North to South and then split into two pieces.;2014-06-30 05:55:00;4 seconds;Bright white fireball moving from North to South and then split into two pieces. Bright white fireball moving from North to South.  The fireball dimmed to almost gone then came back bright and split into 2 pieces.  It seemed to be on our side of the clouds. I looked up and saw it and told my wife.  She had time to turn around and watch it also.;32.8365489583333;-97.1748140625
