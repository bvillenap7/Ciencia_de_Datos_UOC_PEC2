I went outside and up in the sky, I saw a reddish-orange light.  It circled to the left and back to the right and suddenly the sound and the light disappeared.   I noticed 2 airplanes in the sky, a long distance away.  The planes had blinking lights very distinguished and were going normal speed.;29.7289;-99.0485
