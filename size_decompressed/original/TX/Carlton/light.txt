We were training horses when out of the corner of my eye I saw an orange light. I told everyone to look up ,first one bright light ,then two ,then three.It would skip an even space and do it again ,three times and then back to the first lights.These lights were flashing horizontally. We saw it that way twice then the lights flashed vertically. We watched for about 30 minutes as it moved around us. Then it slowly flew away, calmly, as if it were done.;31.8982;-98.1853
