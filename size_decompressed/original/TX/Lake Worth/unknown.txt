Two sets of four bright, round, evenly-spaced lights flying low over the highway;2007-11-13 20:20:00;5-10 minutes;Two sets of four bright, round, evenly-spaced lights flying low over the highway I was traveling west on Jacksboro Highway at approximately 8:20 pm on 11/13/07.  I saw two sets of four bright, round, evenly-spaced lights flying in front of me from left to right (I guess it’s South to North).  As soon as they reached the highway, they abruptly made a 90 degree turn and started flying eastbound over Jacksboro Highway.  I could see them start to sway from side to side, first by raising the right side of the craft and then raising the left side of the craft.  I continued going westbound and I looked in my side mirrors and saw a very bright light in the center above the four lights.  It illuminated what appeared to be the sides of a domed top.  I could not rationally explain what it was that I saw because it wasn’t like anything I’d ever seen before.  I did not hear any noise coming from the flying craft above me, so I eliminated the fact that it could have been a helicopter.  It was flying very low, so I didn’t think it could be an airplane.  And also, when it made the “turn” to follow Jacksboro Highway (east), the lights didn’t move.  They didn’t change their position.  I couldn’t even tell that the craft had turned until it started flying toward me.;32.8282;-97.4508
Green light shoots out of tree line and dives into lake;2012-06-05 22:30:00;five seconds;Green light shoots out of tree line and dives into lake I was driving home from work along Highway 1-99 from Lake Worth to Azle.  I was about to get on the bridge crossing the lake when I looked to my right and saw a green light shoot out of the tree line.  I flewed above the trees for about two or three seconds before it quickly dove down (presumably into the lake).  This could be a case of a USO.   I would prefer to be contacted over email because I feel more comfortable typing than talking.;32.8282;-97.4508
