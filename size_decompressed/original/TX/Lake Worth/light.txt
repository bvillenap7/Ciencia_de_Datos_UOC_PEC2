Two bright objects moving in formation.;2019-09-10 22:10:00;30 seconds;Two bright objects moving in formation I was driving home from work a little after 10PM.  I was crossing the 199 bridge over Lake Worth when an object to my right (in a northerly direction I believe) caught my attention.  I turned and saw two very bright objects in the sky flying in a northwesterly/northerly direction.  One appeared high than the other and as they got closer to the horizon, they began to level out.  I tried to keep them in my vision for as long as possible but they eventually dipped below the horizon and out of sight.  I thought they could've been two aircraft but I didn't see any signal lights.  I then thought maybe I was seeing the landing lights but any of the airports that could handle an aircraft of that size were in the complete opposite direction.;32.8282;-97.4508
