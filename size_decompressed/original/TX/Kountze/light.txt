UFO seen by 3 over Texas;2001-10-26 01:30:00;40 minutes;UFO seen by 3 over Texas I saw a slow or non moving object almost due east from my house - about 10 - 20,000 feet high, with a constant, very bright white light and flashing blue, red, green and maybe purple color alternatingly flashing, sometimes 2 or more colors could be seen at once. Th object remained in its position for 30 to 40 minutes and seemed to move up in elevation very slowly. There was no lateral movement seen. If I were guessing I would say it was probably over an area of Buna and Deweyville, TX.;30.3703;-94.3257
Super Bright Lights Over Field In Texas;2009-02-21 21:00:00;5 Hours;Super Bright Lights Over Field In Texas On February 21, 2009, my husband and I observed a large intensively bright yellow ball with a hint of red on one end to the west and right on the horizon. We were curious and I grabbed my binoculars since I do not have a telescope. The light was stationary for about 20 minutes and it then began to drift up and down. The next night on February 22 we observed a large very bright white ball of light higher in the sky and still to the west.;30.3703;-94.3257
