AT approximately 5 A. M. on the morning of May 5, 2009, I saw a bright white light in the eastern sky. The light appeared to be inside the earthâ€™s atmosphere as I could see stars behind the object that were nowhere near as close.  From my position (in Magnolia, TX) I would place the object above the Woodlands, TX or just north of that location.  The objected appeared to be burning in some manner getting brighter then dimmer.  The fire appeared to be coming out of a central point at the bottom of the object. The object seemed to hover and remained stationary the entire time I watched. I went and got a pair of binoculars to see if I could see the object better, but the object was so bright I could not see past the glare. I then videotaped the object for a bit using the digital zoom to get as close as I could. At full zoom the object appeared to be a sphere however I could not tell if this was an actual sphere or just a reaction of the camera to the brightness of the object.   I checked the web to see if maybe there was a natural explanation for the light but was unable to locate anything.  Clouds began to move in and I could no longer see the object.;30.2012692307692;-95.6334384615384
