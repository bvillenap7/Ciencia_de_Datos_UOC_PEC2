Objects were coming from the south at airplane speed then slowed to almost slow hover. Each craft appeared 1 at a time and disappeared out of my line of site because of neighbors tree and never appeared on the other side of tree. Objects were black in color and missed taking a picture of the first one because record didnâ€™t work on my phone. Took pictures from my back patio.;32.7255;-96.6233000000001
