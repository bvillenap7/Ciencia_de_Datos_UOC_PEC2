I saw a huge circle of lights in front of me, not very far off.;1998-06-01 23:00:00;4 minutes;I was driving home from work one night, it was about 11pm.  I saw a huge circle of lights in front of me, not very far off.  There weren't many other cars around, it was a rural highway just leaving Aransas.  There were some headlights in my rearview mirror.  I kept driving, the ufo lights moved on to the passenger side window.  Just over the grassy area by the highway.  They were a yellowish color.   I slowed down, but didn't stop.  I saw a gleam of metal around the lights and this thing was just hovering low to the ground.   I hit the gas and hurried home, the car behind me stopped where I slowed down.
