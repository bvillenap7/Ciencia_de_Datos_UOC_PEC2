It moved very strange like motion I never seen anything like it, the second object flue the same way over the sky as the first on and it disappeared on the same spot as the first one. All we know is that they disappeared in midair no clouds in site.;32.9375734579437;-97.082866355141
Bright  White and Blue light in the sky. 10mins of observation.;2004-10-23 01:00:00;10 mins;Bright  White and Blue light in the sky. 10mins of observation. I was heading on Hwy 26 going toward Grapevine/ Southlake when I saw the extremely bright light. I only noticed it because of how it shimmered in the night sky. I was driving and my girlfriend was in the passanger set. When I noticed it was at a 2o'clock high. Now, when you looked at the light it shimmered to a bright white to a almost electric blue, to a dim gray. I was amazing. My girlfriend thought it was a plain but it didn't have the signature lights blinking off the wings and tail. (I know this because the DFW airport is right beside both grapevine and southlake for air traffic.)When we ruled out if it was a plain, and anything else I told her  maybe its a UFO? She started to laugh and then stopped suddenly and said you know it could be because that is the only thing that it might be. I did the normal thing and compare on how high it might have been up in the sky. I would have to say at least 5,000ft to 10,000ft While driving home of the 20mins it takes to get home, we watched it until it just dissolved or ...disappeared, if that is what you want to call it.  All I have to say is that this is my second time to see one and I got the same stomach ach that I had the last time I saw one the DFW area.;32.9375734579437;-97.082866355141

Then, it slowed abruptly and stoped brieflyand reversed backwards and upwards at about a 45 degree angle. The light then slowly moved vertically downwards and then continued on its original trajectory before literally fading away....I am extremely freaked out I had never seen anything quite like this...so i logged online and found this site to report it...

Strange light in sky flared up, then split into four objects, then faded.;2009-11-05 19:45:00;5 minutes;Strange light in sky flared up, then split into four objects, then faded. While riding in car with my boyfriend, I noticed a very bright object in the western sky.  This object seemed to flare - the light became fire-like. I pointed it out to my boyfriend, and we saw, immediately after this, the object quickly became three objects, then four.  Each object seemed to float slowly downward, and each light faded, and then re-illuminated - each one repeated this numerous times.  At first we thought this was an airplane which potentially caught fire, however, we ruled this out because there was no smoke, and the new objects were lights, not fireballs. Plus, each object faded, and then re-illuminated several times.;32.9375734579437;-97.082866355141
