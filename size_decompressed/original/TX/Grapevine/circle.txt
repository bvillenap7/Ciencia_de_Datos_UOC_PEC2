First spotted at friend's house at 8:00 pm in the southwestern sky, blinking dot of light white and blue, swinging left to right, and dropped down from about 40,000 feet in about 5 seconds and was gone. My vehicle was acting strangely with gauges not reflecting correct data.  Before arriving to my friend's house, I had filled up my car full of gas.  Heading south on HWY 121 at approximately 8:30 pm the highway lights went out, highways abandoned, an encompassing bright white light flashed before me.  Before I knew it, I was heading West on Interstate 30 and the time was 9:30pm. The distance between the point I was at on 121 South to the point I found myself at on 30West is approximately 10miles and does not take one hour to travel and my gas tank is empty.
