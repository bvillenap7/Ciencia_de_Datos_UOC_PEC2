I saw a green light slowly illuminate in a oval shape, and then it slowly moved west for a second.;2015-11-02 18:46:00;3 seconds;Just north of DFW airport, many planes were in line in the air with full white lights on and in between ones landing and the next plane's descent, I saw a green light slowly illuminate in a oval shape, and then it slowly moved west for a second and the green light dimmed and dissappeared.  It appeared to move from the flight path of the next in bound landing plane....  I'm not a UFO enthusiast or seen anything  before, this was strange.
