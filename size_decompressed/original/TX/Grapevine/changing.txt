SHAPE CHANGING OBJECT ON FIXED COURSE.;2004-02-29 17:45:00;2MIN;SHAPE CHANGING OBJECT ON FIXED COURSE. CRAFT SEEN AT EVENING HOURS.  THE OBJECT FLEW FROM SOUTH TO NORTH ON A FIXED COURSE.  IT WAS LIKE NOTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN.  IT WAS AN UNDEFINABLE SHAPE.  IT STARTED OUT AS A TRIANGLE SHAPE BUT CONSTANTLY WAS CHANGING.  AT TWO POINTS IN THE VIEWING IT LOOKED LIKE IT SPLIT IN TWO AND THEN CAME BACK TOGETHER.  THE OBJECT LOOKED BLACK OR DARK RED.  MY GIRLFRIEND WAS A WITNESS TO IT AND AGREED THAT IT SPLIT IN TWO AND CAME BACK TOGETHER.  THERE WERE NO LIGHTS OR SOUND.;32.9375734579437;-97.082866355141
