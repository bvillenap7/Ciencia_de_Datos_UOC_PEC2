I spotted a triangular shaped UFO (with rounded corners) last night accelerate from 100s to 1000s of mph as it sped away in an arc trajectory heading east.  Before accelerating it flashed a white light around all its edges simultaneously(outlining itself as a triangle). Afterwards only a single point of red light could be seen.  Then off it went.
