Bright Blue flash seen in the N.W.  sky.;2004-12-03 18:00:00;seconds;Bright Blue flash seen in the N.W.  sky. I thought I was seeing things.  I live by the DFW airport, just off of 121north and Grapevine Parkway. I live in apartments where you can see just over the tree line. I was putting up Christmas lights, on my porch when I saw a very strange light. Extreemly bright blue, almost like a pulsating blue. I know that it wasn't an airplane because it was admitting one bright blue light. Also, most of the planes must have seen something because it was bright enough that from there view it must have been a sight to see. As I watched it, it shot stright up in the sky and left a light trail behind it. I lost it because of the cloud cover that evening but I know that it couldn't have been a commercial plane because of the speed. When I told my friends about it they just laughed and said I was seeing things. This was my first sighting of what I couldn't explain. Its my first UFO sighting, in my words.;32.9375734579437;-97.082866355141
