Stars don't move;2020-11-21 21:30:00;1 hr;Stars don't move Saw an object that looked like a star but was a different color to any star I've ever seen.  It was amber in color and moved in a circular pattern.  Kept watching and it would get closer the further.  The circular object that we observed moved also back and forth.  The sky was clear 61 degrees outside. We took photos.;32.7489999999999;-96.4629000000001
