V Shape of Lights over North Texas.  ((anonymous report));1985-10-12 01:00:00;<10 seconds;V Shape of Lights over North Texas Subject: UFO  Date:  October 1985  Time:  Estimated 01:00 CST  Witness age:  13  Location: 32°44'02.1N 96°28'55.1W  Visibility:  1 mile  Cloud Ceiling:   Estimated 1,000 Feet Temperature: Estimated 70 Degrees Fahrenheit Relative  Humidity:  Estimated 65%  Object type:  V-shape formation of 7 white lights Speed:  Estimated 60 knots Direction of travel:  NE to SW at approximate heading 185 degrees I was laying on a picnic table bench in the back patio area, looking up at the sky (I did this almost nightly) and thinking.  While at that age I very much wanted to see and actively searched for UFO’s, I was not thinking of the topic on this particular evening.  Especially since there was complete cloud cover with a low ceiling.   As I was laying with my feet to the west, with a viewing angle of approximately 70 degrees upward, I suddenly saw a V shape formation of 7 white lights moving swiftly just above the clouds from NE to SW, following State Road FM740.  The lights had a slight oval shape to them, but were very well defined, indicating that the craft was just above the cloud layer.  There was no sound at all.  The craft was completely silent from my position.  As it started to disappear from my view to the southwest, I jumped up and moved towards the eastern fence of the patio to watch it continue over the row of houses.  I was able to watch it for about 150 more yards ! (ground distance) before I lost sight of it.  Still there was no sound, nor variance in speed or formation.  I immediately went into the house and told my mother of the incident.  To my knowledge, there were no other witnesses.  I did not ask any of my friends or neighbors due to fear of ridicule.
