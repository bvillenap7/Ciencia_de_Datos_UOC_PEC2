Black rectangular quiet no lights flew right over us.;2001-08-02 20:30:00;3 minutes;Black rectangular quiet no lights flew right over us. My son and I were leaving the store parking lot, admiring the almost full moon that was just rising. to the right of the moon, at a low altitude (same altitude a helicopter such as a traffic helicopter would fly) saw a dark object. it was fairly far away and I asked my son, is that a baloon, someone must have lost their balloon The object became larger and I then noted it was heading in our direction at a steady pace (about same speed as helicopter and also approx. same size) The object flew towards us, we got a very clear view as we sat at the red light. It was almost perfectly rectangle. It was very dark, I'd say black all over. No noticable winds, no rotor blades, NO lights. It flew right over us, I stuck my head out the window and looked right up at it, NO noise. I was looking right at it and still cannot tell you what it was1 Never saw anything like it in my 42 years! It just quietly flew over and kept going, at that point the light changed and I had to move. Should have turned right and followed it! Any ideas what this could have been???;32.9269624203821;-96.5523388535036
