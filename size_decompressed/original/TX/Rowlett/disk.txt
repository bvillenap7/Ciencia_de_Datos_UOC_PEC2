Disc shaped object caught on cell phone camera in Rowlett Texas.;2009-10-11 18:00:00;unknown;Disc shaped object caught on cell phone camera in Rowlett Texas. My son was at a friends house in our neighborhood on 10/11/2009, he wanted to take a few random pictures with his camera/cell phone to see if he could catch a orb.  At the time he took the picture he did not see the UFO, that is until the next evening when he was going through his pictures.  He showed us what he took and our first response was that is a UFO.  My husband and I then looked at each other and thought Oh my gosh.  My husband forwarded the picture to his cell phone and zoomed in on the object and it was clear as day, a UFO.  We spoke with the boys and they did not see the UFO or hear any strange noises.  We are interested in understanding how they did not see the object and how it just appeared in the picture.;32.9269624203821;-96.5523388535036
