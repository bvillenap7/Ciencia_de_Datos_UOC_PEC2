It sat there for a long time, enough time for me to get my hubby up who used to be a pilot, but he wasn't very interested.  My husband thought it was a star or planet and went back to bed.  I grabbed my glasses.  I went back out to watch it for about 10 more minutes.  It seemed to be rotating and wobbling slightly and released what looked like steam a couple of times during that observation.  I left, and then came back out 3 minutes later and it was gone.  I don't know what this was, it was not any type of commercial aircraft.  And during that time there was no commercial flights observed.  I may have been 3 to 4 miles away, but that is only a guess. I couldn't get my cell phone to capture it due to the darkness.   This was interesting for sure.  Thank you.;32.9269624203821;-96.5523388535036
