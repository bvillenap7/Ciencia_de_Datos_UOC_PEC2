I live in Rowlett, Texas and on Oct 16, 2009, at approximately 20:00 I was standing in my front yard . It was dark outside. I looked up toward the western sky and saw what I thought was a bright star. When I looked further, it appeared to be flashing colors. I then thought it must be an airplane. I kept watching it and noticed that it wasn't moving. I called my husband to come look at it. He couldn't determine what the object was either. We grabbed my son's binoculars (not high quality) and was able to make out a circular shape with mainly the bottom half only visible. It was a white light with multiple colors flashing or pulsating within the sphere. The texture reminded me of a decorative ball made up of twine, meaning there were un-uniformed holes in it. The object moved very slow. We actually watched it for approximately 25 minutes. It finally went behind a cloud and we lost sight of it. I have no idea what it was. I know it wasn't a star, airplane, helicopter or planet. I've never seen a ufo. This my first. I'm very interested in finding out what it could have been. I would appreciate any assistance. Thank you, ((name deleted));32.9269624203821;-96.5523388535036

Came from across the street hovered over  the neighbors house the size of a baseball , pointing down as if to spy on the house so I freaked and it pointed at me and shut off the brightest light and glowing red then it hovered off as if it was embarrassed.  I've never been so scared in my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));32.9269624203821;-96.5523388535036
