I HAD BEEN UPDATING MY COMPUTER FOR PERFORMANCE ISSUES. IT WAS A DARK NIGHT SO I TOOK A FLASHLIGHT WITH ME. I RAN OF THE CATS AND OBSERVED THE BEAUTIFUL NIGHT SKY AND THE STARS. I FLASHED THE BIG DIPPER WITH MY FLASHLIGHT AND ABOUT TWO MINUTES LATER I OBSERVED A WHITE LIGHT ABOUT THE SIZE OF A STAR AND THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT TILL IT EMITTED A HUGE LIGHT DISPLAY. IT SHONE A HUGE CIRLCE OF LIGHT IN A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT IN CENTER OF CIRCLE AND YELLOW IN MIDDLE OF CIRCLE AND DEEP RED ON OUTSIDE OF CIRCLE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A HUGE BEACH BALL I THOUGHT WOW WHAT DID I SEE. I KNOW IT WAS NOT A SUPERNOVA IT TOOK JUST ABOUT FIVE SECOUNDS AND DISAPPEARED. I HOPE SOME ELSE SAW IT TOO. I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS WAS A UFO IT WAS TOWARDS THE WESTERN SKY TOWARDS  SALADO  TEXAS.
