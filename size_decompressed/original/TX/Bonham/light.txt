Light overhead in sky.;2000-07-29 23:00:00;3-4 seconds;light overhead in sky late in the evening, exact time unknown, I saw a light at about 30 degrees above the horizon to the north-northwest(I believe, exact directions unknown for sure) that was approximately 4 times the diameter and about the same brightness of a medium bright star. It moved from the position named above to overhead then about 45 degrees above wouth-southeast horizon in about 3 to 4 seconds. I was trying to get other family members attention to get additional witness', but another camper decided to shine a light in my eyes at that moment to see what I was talking about. By the time I could get any degree of night sight back there was nothing to see any longer. If you have any idea what this might have been that I saw please feel free to contact me, my curiousity is peaked. This was no aircraft, I could see aircraft in the area, and there is no comparison, there was no sound, though I feel it was very high I have no way of knowing how high it was.
