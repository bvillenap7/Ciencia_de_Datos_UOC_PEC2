Silver egg shape over six houses.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax??  PD));2008-10-01 19:12:00;5 minutes;Silver egg shape over six houses. Me and three of my friends were swimming in my friend's pool and we saw about five egg-shaped UFO's fly overhead and just hover there for about five minutes. There was a foggy haze around the spacecrafts. They were silver and they reflected lights from the houses in the neighborhood. The spacecrafts lights flashed twice, it changed colors quite a few times, and they made beeping sounds before they flew off. I haven't seen anything like that since then.
