It was an early evening in October in Stafford a suburb of Houston, Texas. Night time comes early in the fall as I was driving on airport blvd. I had exited airport blvd off the southwest fry.  Airport Blvd. is a short road that runs from the frwy to Murphy road.  I was on my way to have a conversation with my ex-wife about our son.  We were to meet at the Casa Ole restaurant located on Murphy Rd.  To the right of airport Blvd is Texas Instruments a large computer chip manufacturer.  Half way down the street there is a grassy area between the road and the T.I. parking lot. T.I. has workers 24 hours a day so anyone starting at 6:00 PM would be coming in to work the second shift.  I was driving east, the stars were bright, the sky was clear.  Halfway down the street right over the grassy area a beam of bluish, purplish light appeared on the ground from about 30 feet in the air.  I heard no sound, saw no craft.  My gaze was on the beam of light, suddenly a man appears on the ground and runs toward the T.I. parking lot.  My eyes follow him at first then as I gaze to where the beam of light was it is gone.  This all happened so quickly I put it out of my mind and went and had the meeting with my ex-wife and never thought about it again until I started to hear people share their stories on coast to coast radio.  I many years later concluded that this person worked at T.I. and was given a ride to work. Now I am sharing my story on your site. Thanks for allowing me to do so.
