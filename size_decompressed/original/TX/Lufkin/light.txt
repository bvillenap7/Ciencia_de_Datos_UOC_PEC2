In the spring of '98 around 9:00 at night,I observed an object traveling from west to east at a high rate of speed (about 10 times the speed of a jetliner).The object then slowed to about 3/4 its original speed and made a knife-edged 90 degree turn to the right,then sped up to its original speed,made another 90 degree turn to the left,traveled about 1/4 mile,made another turn to the right.It continued this until it disappeared behind a group of trees.The object was a single white point of light, high in the sky,roughly guessing about 10 to 20 thousand feet.It didn't make a sound and it never flashed or blinked out once and there was no other aircraft around. This was observed by myself and another person. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Nine o'clock is 21:00 hrs. we have changed the time here.  PD));31.3177652542373;-94.7502186440677
Object hovering over defunct industrial factory;2012-01-27 20:00:00;20 mins;object hovering over defunct industrial factory Distance - 250 yards looking west from the east side of facility Size - 20' Altitude - 60'-70' from ground Shape - oblong cylinder/cigar, object was a long horizontal light. Industrial Factory - Latitude 31°21'28.93N Longitude 94°40'32.02W  I was notified by my uncle of a light over the industrial factory at about 8pm.  Bright white light hovering over one of the buildings. Stayed there for 20 mins before vanishing. I live by this defunct facility.  This is not the first light I have seen over it. (unreported as it was new years eve[midnight] and people were shooting off rockets although not where I saw the light hovering over the smoke stack and has not been there since)  The ONLY lights the facility has are 2 red blinking lights atop the central smoke stack that is about 150'-175' tall.  They are visible during day and night. At first I wasn't sure of what my uncle was telling me about, he claimed it was a star. (my uncle has mental retardation and klinefelter's syndrome, to him it was just a star as he doesn't know the difference in stars, satellites, planets, or aircraft)  So I decided since I had already seen an unidentified lighted object before that has since not returned I would investigate.  I tried to tell him it was too large to be a star or planet as well too low to the ground.  He went back inside and I walked out of my yard and stood by the factory's fence to observe, continued to watch the object for 20 minutes before it simply vanished.;31.3177652542373;-94.7502186440677
