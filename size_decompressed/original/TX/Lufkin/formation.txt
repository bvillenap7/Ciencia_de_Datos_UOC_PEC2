They were maybe 100 yards apart. At first, I thought they were radio tower lights, but as I kept driving, I noticed the lights were moving in a North to South direction. I stopped the truck and watched the lights, but I couldn't hear any noise like plane or helicopter. We only have 1 small airport that closes down at dark. The lights were about 2000 feet up and stayed in a general straight line and didn't seem to be moving very fast, until they were past me. Then they sped up and the lights disappeared.
