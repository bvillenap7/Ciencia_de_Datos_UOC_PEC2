As we were traveling home along a rural farm road we spotted an unusual light in the sky moving slowly toward the road from east to west.  It didn't move like any familiar airplane, so we pulled over to watch for a minute.  The object was shaped similar to a Stealth, except with a thinner, smoother head-on profile, and with much more bluntly squared-off wingtips and nose.  It moved extremely slowly, no faster than a motorized hangglider,  and completely without engine noise, although it was at a relatively low altitude. (below low-hanging clouds.)  As it passed over our vehicle, its span covered the length of the Suburban.  It had a very large white spotlight at its nose and two bright lights at each wingtip.  The underside had many patterned rows of small colored lights, with an amber double row down the center.  The underside gave the impression of being textured or plated.  There was absolutely no engine noise, even though the craft was very low and very slow.  After pass!ing overhead, two or three small, blue sparkles dropped from the craft.  Not quite believing what we had witnessed, and not being fervent UFO watchers, we decided not to report the sighting. Witnesses were myself, a high school library director, my husband, an industrial chemist, and my 15-yr-old son.;31.3177652542373;-94.7502186440677
