Multipul blinkers with red ,blue and white strobing lights, across the sky. only one circle shaped.;2004-07-16 03:00:00;2.5 hours;Multipul blinkers with red ,blue and white strobing lights, across the sky. only one circle shaped. 07/16/04. from dusk till dawn the ufo's w/blinking red,blue and white lights were across the sky.The lights looked just like the L.E.D. lights used on the Texas st. trooper cruiser.very vivid and could be seen clearly all night. Some appeared to be docked @ one location,the others wre roaming across the sky at will. They were all exactly the same in dimentions and appearance. From due east at 3:00am a single ufo appeared,roughly 060 degrees magnetic. this one was huge when compared to the blinkers.AT first, I thought it was a weather balloon. This one rose in the sky to maybe 45 degrees,Blinked off and on twice very slowly. IT sat still a few seconds and started changeing color. From white to plum to orange and back to white with a pea green ring around it that looked hot.Almost like steam rising from it. It appeared in that area of the sky untill daylight and no longer visable. The object was very active spinning and changing color. On a few occasions it looked as if its size (overall) was changing. still circular, but smaller or bigger.At daylight all the ufo's we saw that night just kept doing the same thing until the sun was too bright and they could no longer be seen with naked eye. Several of the observers have been watching the blinkers everynight from 070704  to present. This was the fist time any of this group had seen the big circular object. Tonight,07/16/04 I stood at the ready again but the sky was too cloudy.;31.3177652542373;-94.7502186440677
40' white light emitting circular craft.;2014-05-28 22:30:00;unsure;40' white light emitting circular craft I get home at about 22:30 and back my car into the car port.  Walking out from under it I immediately have a 40' white light glowing circle (emitting enough light for the surrounding area to appear daylight) hovering directly over me about 20 or so feet up.  This lasted for about 3 minutes. Next day I was up at 7:45AM feeling like I had alcohol poisoning..felt as if every part of my body was in agony down to the molecule.  All my energy had been drained. Went back to sleep and woke up at 22:00.  3 days later I am still feeling the effect. Since I don't drink and do not do manual labor for a living I have no other explanation, other than being chosen for testing rather than the usual being an observer or along for the ride so to say. Had to be some form of a molecular scan. Talked to a fellow associate at ICAR earlier and was recommended to send a report in to this site.;31.3177652542373;-94.7502186440677
