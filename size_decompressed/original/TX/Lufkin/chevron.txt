My wife and I observed chevron shaped lights moving across the sky;2010-10-12 21:00:00;30 seconds;My wife and I observed chevron shaped lights moving across the sky My wife and I were sitting outside about 9pm on 2010/10/09 when we noticed something floating in the sky to the southwest of us and moving in what appeared to be a southerly direction.  From the moment we noticed it to when it disappeared took at most maybe 30 seconds. The shape of the object was hard to make out, it appeared washed out and possibly transparent with lights shaped similar to a delta wing aircraft with the exception that in the dront instead of being pointed it seemed curved much like a boomerang would be. As I stated earlier, the object seemed to be floating across the sky, a very fluid movement with no jerkiness or changes in direction or speed up until the point that it just disappeared.  It had been raining earlier that day, but the sky appeared clear of clouds since we could clearly see the stars and moon out.;31.3177652542373;-94.7502186440677
