They looked like stars. I was gazing at the stars as I was relaxing in my pool when I noticed two stars that appeared to be moving!!!  Yes, they were moving, flying side by side at the same exact speed.  I watched them until they flew out of my sight.  No fancy lights, just faint looking stars.  They were flying easterly because I was facing north.  I want to know if anybody else seen this.  I am a little scared because I know what I saw was real.;33.2434;-95.911
