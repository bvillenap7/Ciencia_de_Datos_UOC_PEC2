It hovered. It sat there for a couple of minutes. There was two other persons there that saw it. One is no longer with us due to his death. It happened in 1974 when I was in high school. We never told anyone because we could not believe it and did not think anyone else would. I have wondered about it since. After we watched it hover there, all of the sudden it took off over the horizon. But we thought it went down a couple of blocks over in my neighborhood. So, we went on our bicycles to see where it landed. Then we realized that it had gone over the horizon and not in our neighborhood. It was an inexplainable experience. This is what happened and there is no doubt about it. It is what it is. It happened! I have not resolved it yet. I still wonder and don't know what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
