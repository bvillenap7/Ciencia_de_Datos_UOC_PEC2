I first noticed what appeared to be an airplane with lots of lights flying in completely the wrong direction.  It was going from east to west, which even my husband thought was strange.  We both watched it from our front porch for about five minutes, until it dissappeared.  This was enough time for me to see the shape, a wide cylinder, along with the color in the lights-we noticed white, red, yellow and blue-which spanned the width of the object.  It appearred to fly erratically, in a 'zig-zag' pattern, as my husband stated.   When it was almost gone we heard a loud noise, similar to a plane, but much bigger, and too high and too late to be a plane.  Also, there was no 'boom' as a supersonic-which we have heard several times in the last year or so, as well as seen.   Please tell us if ther were any other sightings of this object at this time.  We are in Central Standard Time.  It is now 1:37 am and this has just happened 1 1/2 hrs. ago, so it's fresh in my memory.;32.2983;-96.0124
