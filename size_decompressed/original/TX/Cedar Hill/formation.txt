Large triangle formation of white lights slowly move across sky, as one light crosses behind its path.;2002-07-07 04:37:00;3 minutes;Large triangle formation of white lights slowly move across sky, as one light crosses behind its path. I was looking at the sky with binoculars while learning to use my new telescope.  At 4:37 a.m., I looked in the southwestern portion of the sky (approximately 11 o'clock high) and observed a triangle formation of white lights moving in a downward arc direction from west to east. They looked exactly like a constellation of stars but were moving through the sky, comparable in size to the Big Dipper, and could not be detected with the naked eye.  During the first few seconds of my observation, another white light passed just behind the formation's path moving northwest to southeast.  This single light moved faster than the triangle formation and continued passed it at a steady speed and direction. My first impression was that the single light was a satelite. I kept my attention on the triangle formation, noting that the lights moved in precise syncrinicity with each other, until disappearing behind the horizen at 4:40 a.m.  I should also point out that I was standing less than 1/4 mile from four television/radio transmission towers.;32.5892000000001;-96.9439999999998
Group of 5 independently moving craft.;2013-03-19 08:00:00;few minutes;group of 5 independently moving craft Shortly after driving away from my house on my way to work on Tuesday morning in Cedar Hill, I saw a formation of 4-5 craft hovering and/or floating in the sky to my southwest.  The craft were very odd appearing, dark in color, with each craft oriented in the same direction, facing south. The shape of each craft looked similar to an outline of the New England Patriots helmet logo, with the tapered end facing north. Each craft &quotfloated&quot independently, with slight movements among them in different directions such that I was able to discern multiple crafts instead of one.  The height of the crafts was about 3000 feet, and they were drifting away from me to the west.  When I first saw them, I had a very eery feeling as if they were monitoring or observing the ground from above. The crafts were silent.  They were too large for birds. I had wondered if they were drones, but they moved so close to each other that it would have been impossible for them to prevent interference among them with propellors or with other conventional means of propulsion. I had also wondered if they were kites, but the objects were too large and too high to be kites because there was no wind that morning that could have kept the kites aloft. I stopped my car, and walked around to the other side near the west to begin taking an iPhone video of them. By the time that I had started the video recording, the crafts had drifted sufficiently far away such that they appear only as very small dots on the video. Because they were drifting away, and because I was late to work, I stopped the video recording, and returned to my car.;32.5892000000001;-96.9439999999998
