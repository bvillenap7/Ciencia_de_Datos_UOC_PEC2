Object seen from Joe Pool Lake in Cedar Hill, Texas.  I had a clear, panoramic view of the sky.  Bright light (intensity of Haligen lights) moving from West to East.  DFW Airport is located approximately 20 miles from my point of view, so I thought it was an airplane since planes fly in the area all the time.  However, this light moved at the speed of a military jet. Suddenly the light came to a complete stop at about the two o'clock position in the NW part of the sky. It was still much larger than a star with a brightness consistent with Haligen lights.  In a matter of minutes, it began to wane in size comparative with the stars around it.  As it got smaller, the white light appeared to pulsate with color.  I had binoculars with me and promptly used them for a better view.  This object, or whatever, twinkled and pulsated with red, green and white colors. At times it appeared to have a strobe effect.  I never took my eyes off of it and waited for it to make a move.  Except for a small, gradual sway of motion to one side of the other, it successfully disguised itself as one of the stars, staying in formation with them, even throughout the earth's rotation.  I watched for over an hour.  Now I question my sanity . . .;32.5892000000001;-96.9439999999998
