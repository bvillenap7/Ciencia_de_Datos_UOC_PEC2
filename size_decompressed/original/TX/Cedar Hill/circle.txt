Object flying in night sky seen by three people that were camping;2013-07-04 04:30:00;10 minutes;Object flying in night sky seen by three people that were camping My wife, son (16) and I were up late at our camp sight at joe pool lake.  We were looking up at the stars and noticed one flashing more than others then  quickly moved to one side of the sky then moved again.  This happen several more times before it just  disappeared.   I believe it was round and it was almost the same color as the stars only it had more blue in it.   The object seemed to be as high in the sky as the stars and then it was gone.  We watched this for about ten minutes;32.5892000000001;-96.9439999999998
