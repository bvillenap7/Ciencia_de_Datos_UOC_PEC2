My husband and I were headed home south after dinner at La Madeleine  about 8:00 P.M.   I noticed lights in the sky to the west, but since there's a flight path over my neighborhood thought it was an airplane or maybe a helicopter.  	As we  headed towards our house I noticed that it was moving the same direction we were.  I watched as it stopped in the sky to the west.  It didn't look like anything I'd ever seen before, but as large as it was couldn't see it clearly enough to tell exactly what it was.  The sky was perfectly clear.  	I went inside to get my binoculars while my husband called our neighbor.  My husband went in and watched TV.  He's quite the skeptic.  I came out with the binoculars and my neighbor got her telescope.  We observed it for about 45 minutes, with the telescope and her binoculars which were better than mine.  It seemed to shift or rotate changing from a muffin shaped object covered in lights to an almond/helmet shape to a sort of round turtle shell shape, but always covered in bright lights.  	Eventually, it began to move slowly down and then we saw that it was  moving away further west.  I went in to get my cell phone and with my neighbor driving we went after the object in her car.  We watched as it moved farther away and then disappeared to the east.  We returned home.  	I have a degree in Computer Science and a degree in Education,  and my neighbor has a Biology degree.  My husband has a Marketing degree.  I've never seen a UFO before.;32.5892000000001;-96.9439999999998
