3 lights with no sound heard, traveling N to S in straight line formation.;2014-01-28 23:15:00;15 seconds;3 lights with no sound heard, traveling N to S in straight line formation Before proceeding, a brief personal history.  I am 59 years old, and a 36 year veteran Police officer in the Dallas TX. area.  In the Military in the 1970's I was in search radar, both air and surface, and am trained in aircraft recognition and performance. I work in the Dallas metro area, but live about 140 miles NE of Dallas near the small town of Omaha Tx.  My house is 8 miles from any town, and its very dark at night, the sky is alive with stars, and the Milky Way blazes across the sky at night. On the listed date and time, I walked out of my house to get something out of my car,  which was parked in front of my barn about 150 feet from my house.  As is my usual habit, I looked up at the sky.  As soon as I looked towards Polaris, I saw 3 lights traveling in a straight line formation, or follow the leader formation.  Since they were only lights, I could not tell the altitude.  From my perspective they were about half the size of a pencil eraser, and again from my perspective, they were approximately 1 foot apart from each other.  The lights were brighter than the stars and were brilliant white.  It is very quiet at my place , and I often hear airliners flying at 30+ thousand feet as they pass over my house as a low roar.  These lights produced no sound at all that I could hear. I cannot estimate the speed at which the lights were traveling since I don't have an altitude to base it on.  However they traversed the sky from North to South till out of sight in about 15 seconds. I don't believe these were satellites.  I know what objects in orbit look like as they pass overhead.  These lights were traveling too fast. 3;33.1825;-94.7647
