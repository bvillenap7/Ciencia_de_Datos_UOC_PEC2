Manuevering bright objects in the western sky, leaving short contrails, disappearing and reappearing.;2004-09-22 19:00:00;30 minutes;Manuevering bright objects in the western sky, leaving short contrails, disappearing and reappearing. I was going from Childress Texas northwest to Memphis Texas when I saw a small bright circle in the western sky above the setting sun.  It was very bright like a star.  It just hung there for a few minutes.  Then it disappeared.  Soon it reappeared then I saw a short tail from it like it was a jet beginning to leave a contrail,however it was very short and then disappeared.  Then I saw another one and the same thing happened.  A long light appeared like a small cloud then it bloomed into a long streak, however it could not have been a cloud that developed so quickly then it evaporated.  I watched this activity until I made a turn and then it went behind a cloud.  I have seen the shiney sphere before not not doing manuevers.  I had decided it was a weather balloon until it left a trail behind and started moving in and out of sight.;34.7102;-100.5304
