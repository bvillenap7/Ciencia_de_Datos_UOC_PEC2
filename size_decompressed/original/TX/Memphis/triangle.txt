ufo in a small town;2005-06-17 21:00:00;10 sec;ufo in a small town my mom and i were on our way to my grandfathers house and they're alot of trees around and above the trees were 3 triangular ufos they had 3 lights on each side they were side by side. i screamed to tell my mom to look but she kept looking the wrong way so i just thought she was to scared to look. well the next day my two sons one is 16 my other is 6 and they  came and told me what they had   seen the night before they described  the exact same thing  except they saw 4 triangular ufos. it was really strange for us to see the same things but my 6 year old came in crying saying he saw an alien between the trees it was the weirdest thing ever.;34.7102;-100.5304
