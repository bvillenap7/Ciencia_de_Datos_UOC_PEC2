Color changing light in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD));2016-08-18 00:00:00;2 days;Color changing light in the sky I noticed a flashing light about a month ago from my apartment window in east Texas.  It moved side to side up and down very slightly and was constantly changing colors.  On the second night after the first sighting it did not appear to me in the sky until 0:00 the same time as the first sighting.  I am looking for someone who has also seen this.  I have seen similar movement in UFO sightings in broken now Oklahoma.  Defiantly not satellites.  We aren't alone people.  I just found this website and my mind is blown to how many people report here.  Will update on any new sightings.  Let me know if you have seen the same. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));32.2486;-96.2161
